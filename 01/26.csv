including oil and gas recovery, carbon sequestration, and contaminant
remediation. Numerical simulation of multiphase flow requires solving of a
large, sparse linear system resulting from the discretization of the partial
differential equations modeling the flow. In the case of multiphase
multicomponent flow with miscible effect, this is a very challenging task. The
problem becomes even more difficult if phase transitions are taken into
account. A new approach to handle phase transitions is to formulate the system
as a nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP). Unlike in the primary variable
switching technique, the set of primary variables in this approach is fixed
even when there is phase transition. Not only does this improve the robustness
of the nonlinear solver, it opens up the possibility to use multigrid methods
to solve the resulting linear system. The disadvantage of the complementarity
approach, however, is that when a phase disappears, the linear system has the
structure of a saddle point problem and becomes indefinite, and current
algebraic multigrid (AMG) algorithms cannot be applied directly. In this study,
we explore the effectiveness of a new multilevel strategy, based on the
multigrid reduction technique, to deal with problems of this type. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the method through numerical results for the
case of two-phase, two-component flow with phase appearance/disappearance. We
also show that the strategy is efficient and scales optimally with problem
size.

solution is obtained by the conformal mapping between the cone and a round

scattering from a vibrating metallic tip over a uniform sample. We find that
the field-induced charge distribution consists of localized terms at the tip

the tip. In recent s-SNOM experiments at the visible-IR range (600nm - 1$\mu

whereas at THz range ($100 \mu m-3mm$) the fundamental becomes comparable to
the higher harmonics. We find that the localized tip charge dominates the
contribution to the higher harmonics and becomes bigger for the THz
experiments, thus providing an intuitive understanding of the origin of the
near-field signals. We demonstrate the application of our method by extracting
a two-dimensional effective dielectric constant map from the s-SNOM image of a
finite metallic disk, where the variation comes from the charge density induced

Based Shaper that was recently proposed by Specht and Samii as a simpler

FIFO queue; the packet at the head of the queue is examined against the
regulation constraints of its flow; it is released at the earliest time at

  Salient Contributions
  The research presents the following salient contributions:
  i. A novel technique has been developed for comparing biographical
information, by combining the average impact of Levenshtein,
Damerau-Levenshtein, and editor distances. The impact is calculated as the
ratio of the edit distance to the maximum possible edit distance between two
strings of the same lengths as the given pair of strings. This impact lies in
the range [0, 1] and can easily be converted to a similarity (matching) score
by subtracting the impact from unity.
  ii. A universal soft computing framework is proposed for adaptively fusing
biometric and biographical information by making real-time decisions to
determine after consideration of each individual identifier whether computation
of matching scores and subsequent fusion of additional identifiers, including
biographical information is required. This proposed framework not only improves
the accuracy of the system by fusing less reliable information (e.g.
biographical information) only for instances where such a fusion is required,
but also improves the efficiency of the system by computing matching scores for
various available identifiers only when this computation is considered
necessary.
  iii. A scientific method for comparing efficiency of fusion strategies
through a predicted effort to error trade-off curve.

of the lensing galaxy redshift of $z \approx 0.9 \pm 0.2$ (90% CL), while its

We apply modified classical nucleation theory which requires surface tensions

and find that they efficiently nucleate at high temperatures of T$_{\rm gas}$ =
1000-1750 K. Cr[s], KCl[s] and NaCl[s] are found to efficiently nucleate across
an intermediate temperature range of T$_{\rm gas}$ = 500-1000 K. We find
CsCl[s] may serve as the seed particle for the water cloud layers in cool

NH$_{3}$[s], H$_{2}$S[s/l] and CH$_{4}$[s], nucleation rates (T$_{\rm gas}$ =

improve the accuracy of the nucleation rate calculation, further research into
the small cluster thermochemical data for each cloud species is warranted. The
validity of these seed particle scenarios will be tested by applying it to more

not yet completely resolved. This is primarily because one has to understand
whether or not the anomalous U(1) symmetry in the flavor sector is effectively
restored along with the chiral symmetry. Since the physics near the chiral
phase transition is essentially non-perturbative, we employ first principles
lattice techniques to address this issue. We use overlap fermions, which have
exact chiral symmetry on the lattice, to probe the anomalous U(1) symmetry
violation of 2+1 flavor dynamical QCD configurations with domain wall fermions.
The latter also optimally preserves chiral and flavor symmetries on the
lattice. We observe that the anomalous U(1) is not effectively restored in the
chiral crossover region. We perform a systematic study of the finite size and
cut-off effects since the signals of U(1) violation are sensitive to it. For
the same reasons we also compare our results from the continuum extrapolated
results of the QCD Dirac spectrum obtained from a different lattice
discretization called Highly Improved Staggered Quarks. Our studies also
provide a glimpse of the microscopic topological structures of the QCD medium
that are responsible for the strongly interacting nature of the quark gluon
plasma phase and related to the physics of confinement and chiral symmetry
breaking.

to the rising affluence of modern cosmological observations than the
concordance model ($\Lambda$CDM) with a rigid cosmological constant, $\Lambda$.
Such is the case with the running vacuum models (RVMs) and to some extent also
with a simple XCDM parametrization. Apart from the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) anisotropies, the most crucial datasets potentially carrying the DDE
signature are: i) baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO), and ii) direct large
scale structure (LSS) formation data (i.e. the observations on
$f(z)\sigma_8(z)$ at different redshifts). As it turns out, analyses mainly
focusing on CMB and with insufficient BAO+LSS input, or those just making use
of gravitational weak-lensing data for the description of structure formation,
generally fail to capture the DDE signature, whereas the few existing studies
using a rich set of CMB+BAO+LSS data (see in particular Sol\`a, G\'omez-Valent
& de Cruz P\'erez 2015,2017; and Zhao et al. 2017) do converge to the
remarkable conclusion that DDE might well be encoded in the current
cosmological observations. Being the issue so pressing, here we explain both
analytically and numerically the origin of the possible hints of DDE in the
context of RVMs, which arise at a significance level of $3-4\sigma$. By
performing a detailed study on the matter and vacuum perturbations within the
RVMs, and comparing with the XCDM, we show why the running vacuum fully relaxes
the existing $\sigma_8$-tension and accounts for the LSS formation data much
better than the concordance model.

Bi2Se3 and find that the in-plane field creates a spatially oscillating
superconducting order parameter in the junction as evidenced by the emergence
of an anomalous Fraunhofer pattern. We describe how the anomalous Fraunhofer
patterns evolve for different device parameters, and we use this to understand
the microscopic origin of the oscillating order parameter. The agreement
between the experimental data and simulations shows that the finite momentum
pairing originates from the coexistence of the Zeeman effect and Aharonov-Bohm
flux.

arbitrary electrically and magnetically anisotropic media for piecewise

non-averaged and averaged methods, respectively. The non-averaged method is
first order accurate, while the averaged method is second order accurate for
smoothly-varying materials and reduces to first order for discontinuous
material distributions. For the standard FDTD field locations with the
co-location of the electric and magnetic materials at the primary computational

algorithms of the constitutive relations for the electric and magnetic fields.
We provide a mathematically rigorous stability proof followed by extensive
numerical testing that includes long-time integration, eigenvalue analysis,
tests with extreme, randomly placed material parameters, and various boundary
conditions. For accuracy evaluation we have constructed a test case with an
explicit analytic solution. Using transformation optics, we have constructed
complex, spatially inhomogeneous geometrical object with fully anisotropic

$\underline{\mu}$, such that a plane wave incident on the object is perfectly
reconstructed downstream. In our implementation, the considerable increase in

identifying and extracting pure spectra from both resolution images, resulting
in 3,287 spectra at 16 m and 15,426 spectra at 4 m. We then unmixed ROIs of

in reduced libraries of 61 spectra at 16 m and 95 spectra at 4 m. The results
show that GMM performs best among the distribution-based methods, producing
comparable accuracy to MESMA, and may be more robust across datasets.

both analytic and numerical analyses of several model systems containing

intrinsic noise, are equal to one. Systems with deficiency one have an
unbalanced non-equilibrium steady state and a non-zero S-flux, defined as the
flux flowing between the complexes multiplied by an adequate stoichiometric
coefficient. In this case, the noise on each species is reduced if the flux
flows from the species of lowest to highest complexity, and is amplified is the
flux goes in the opposite direction. These results are generalized to systems

Citizen science offers an alternative by crowdsourcing data collection. Despite

that consensus classifications made by citizen scientists produce data that is

a web-based project in which citizen scientists view satellite photographs of
coastlines and trace the borders of kelp patches. Since launch in 2014, over
7,000 citizen scientists have classified over 750,000 images of kelp forests
largely in California and Tasmania. Images are classified by 15 users. We
generated consensus classifications by overlaying all citizen classifications
and assessed accuracy by comparing to expert classifications. Matthews
correlation coefficient (MCC) was calculated for each threshold (1-15), and the
threshold with the highest MCC was considered optimal. We showed that optimal
user threshold was 4.2 with an MCC of 0.400 (0.023 SE) for Landsats 5 and 7,

paper we introduce a single, flat ED extension of the kinetic-mixing/dark
photon (DP) portal for dark matter (DM) interactions with the Standard Model
(SM) assuming a compactification `radius' of order $R^{-1}\sim10-1000$ MeV and
examine the resulting modifications to and augmentation of the usual DP
phenomenology. In the present scenario, both the DP and DM experience the full
5-D while the SM fields are constrained to lie on a 4-D brane at the boundary
of the ED. Such a setup can naturally yield the observed value of the DM relic
density and explain the required rough degeneracy of the DM and DP masses
needed to obtain it. Gauge symmetry breaking can occur via boundary conditions
without the introduction of an additional singlet Higgs scalar thus avoiding
all constraints associated with the coupling of such a field to the usual SM
Higgs field in 5-D. The self-consistency of the field redefinitions that map
the gauge fields into a canonical basis and thus removing the kinetic mixing
terms is found to lead to a strong model building constraint on the ED setup
involving a brane localized kinetic term for the 5-D gauge field on the SM
brane. Multiple variations of this scenario are found to be possible which are
consistent with all current experimental constraints but which predict very
different phenomenologies. In this paper, after setting up the general model
formalism, we discuss in detail the case of a complex scalar 5-D DM field,
consistent with constraints arising from the CMB, which may or may not obtain a
vacuum expectation value (vev). The resulting Kaluza-Klein (KK) towers of both
the DM and DP fields are found to yield interesting and distinctive signatures.

over the past decade. Here, we consider a nonlinear Schr\""odinger model with a
complex potential that can be tuned controllably away from being PT-symmetric,
as it might be the case in realistic applications. We utilize two parameters:
the first one breaks PT-symmetry but retains a proportionality between the
imaginary and the derivative of the real part of the potential; the second one,
detunes from this latter proportionality. It is shown that the departure of the
potential from the PT -symmetric form does not allow for the numerical
identification of exact stationary solutions. Nevertheless, it is of crucial
importance to consider the dynamical evolution of initial beam profiles. In
that light, we define a suitable notion of optimization and find that even for
non PT-symmetric cases, the beam dynamics, both in 1D and 2D -although prone to
weak growth or decay- suggests that the optimized profiles do not change
significantly under propagation for specific parameter regimes.

$G_f=Z_2^f\leftthreetimes_{e_2} G_b$ -- a $Z_2^f$ central extension of a finite
group $G_b$ characterized by $e_2\in H^2(G_b,Z_2)$. (3) We find that the EF
topological orders are classified by 2+1D anomalous topological orders
$\mathcal{A}_b^3$ on their unique canonical boundary. Here $\mathcal{A}_b^3$ is
a unitary fusion 2-category with simple objects labeled by $\hat
G_b=Z_2^m\leftthreetimes G_b$. $\mathcal{A}_b^3$ also has one invertible
fermionic 1-morphism for each object as well as quantum-dimension-$\sqrt 2$

$m$ is the generator of $Z_2^m$. (4) When $\hat G_b$ is the trivial $Z_2^m$
extension, the EF topological orders are called EF1 topological orders, which
is classified by simple data $(G_b,e_2,n_3,\nu_4)$. (5) When $\hat G_b$ is a
non-trivial $Z_2^m$ extension, the EF topological orders are called EF2
topological orders, where some intersections of three stringlike excitations
must carry Majorana zero modes. (6) Every EF2 topological order with
$G_f=Z_2^f\leftthreetimes G_b$ can be associated with a EF1 topological order
with $G_f=Z_2^f\leftthreetimes \hat G_b$. (7) We find that all EF topological
orders correspond to gauged 3+1D fermionic symmetry protected topological (SPT)
orders with a finite unitary symmetry group. (8) We further propose that the
general classification of 3+1D topological orders with finite unitary
symmetries for bosonic and fermionic systems can be obtained by gauging or
partially gauging the finite symmetry group of 3+1D SPT phases of bosonic and
fermionic systems.

treatment to 100%. We have seen huge inefficiency and risk in how experiments
are ramped, and it is getting in the way of innovation. This can go both ways:
we ramp too slowly and much time and resource is wasted; or we ramp too fast
and suboptimal decisions are made. In this paper, we build up a ramping
framework that can effectively balance among Speed, Quality and Risk (SQR). We
start out by identifying the top common mistakes experimenters make, and then
introduce the four SQR principles corresponding to the four ramp phases of an
experiment. To truly scale SQR to all experiments, we develop a statistical
algorithm that is embedded into the process of running every experiment to
automatically recommend ramp decisions. Finally, to complete the whole picture,
we briefly cover the auto-ramp engineering infrastructure that can collect

dense and compact star clusters disrupted by processes such as residual gas
expulsion. Gaia astrometry is available for 258 out of 433 members of the
association, with revised Hipparcos astrometry used for the remainder. We use
this data to confirm that the three subgroups of Sco-Cen are gravitationally
unbound and have non-isotropic velocity dispersions, suggesting they have not
had time to dynamically relax. We also explore the internal kinematics of the
subgroups to search for evidence of expansion. We test Blaauw's classical
linear model of expansion, search for velocity trends along the Galactic axes,
compare the expanding and non-expanding convergence points, perform traceback
analysis assuming both linear trajectories and using an epicycle approximation,
and assess the evidence for expansion in proper motions corrected for virtual
expansion / contraction. None of these methods provide coherent evidence for
expansion of the subgroups, with no evidence to suggest that the subgroups had
a more compact configuration in the past. We find evidence for kinematic
substructure within the subgroups that supports the view that they were not
formed by the disruption of individual star clusters. We conclude that Sco-Cen
was likely born highly substructured, with multiple small-scale star formation
events contributing to the overall OB association, and not as single,
monolithic bursts of clustered star formation.

sophistication and at higher spatial and temporal resolutions. These
enhancements permit detailed comparisons between the simulation outputs and
real observational data. Recent projects such as Illustris are capable of
producing simulated images that are comparable to those obtained from local
surveys. This paper tests how well Illustris achieves this goal across a
diverse population of galaxies using visual morphologies derived from Galaxy
Zoo citizen scientists. Morphological classifications provided by volunteers
for simulated galaxies are compared with similar data for a compatible sample
of images drawn from the SDSS Legacy Survey. This paper investigates how simple
morphological characterization by human volunteers asked to distinguish smooth
from featured systems differs between simulated and real galaxy images.
Differences are identified, which are likely due to the limited resolution of
the simulation, but which could be revealing real differences in the dynamical
evolution of populations of galaxies in the real and model universes.
Specifically, for stellar masses $M_{\star}\lesssim10^{11}M_{\odot}$, a larger
proportion of Illustris galaxies that exhibit disk-like morphology or visible
substructure, relative to their SDSS counterparts. Toward higher masses,
simulated and observed galaxies converge and exhibit similar morphology
distributions. The stellar mass threshold indicated by this divergent behavior
confirms recent works using parametric measures of morphology from Illustris
simulated images. When $M_{\star}\gtrsim10^{11}M_{\odot}$, the Illustris
dataset contains fewer galaxies that classifiers regard as unambiguously
featured. These results suggest that comparison between the detailed properties

(XRBs) is a powerful probe of the geometry, kinematics and Fe abundance of
matter around the accretion flow. In a recent study it has been claimed, using
$Chandra$ High-Energy Transmission Grating (HETG) spectra for a sample of XRBs,
that the circumnuclear material is consistent with a solar-abundance, uniform,
spherical distribution. It was also claimed that the Fe K{\alpha} line was
unresolved in all cases by the HETG. However, these conclusions were based on
ad hoc models that did not attempt to relate the global column density to the
Fe K{\alpha} line emission. We revisit the sample and test a self-consistent
model of a uniform, spherical X-ray reprocessor against HETG spectra from 56
observations of 14 Galactic XRBs. We find that the model is ruled out in 13/14
sources because a variable Fe abundance is required. In 2 sources a spherical
distribution is viable but with non-solar Fe abundance. We also applied a
solar-abundance Compton-thick reflection model, which can account for the
spectra that are inconsistent with a spherical model, but spectra with a
broader bandpass are required to better constrain model parameters. We also
robustly measured the velocity width of the Fe K{\alpha} line and found full
width half maximum values up to ~5000 km s$^{-1}$. Only in some spectra was the
Fe K{\alpha} line unresolved by the HETG.

supermassive black hole (SMBH) seeds at high redshifts. The outer part of this
collapse remains optically thin, and has been studied intensively using
numerical simulations. However, the innermost region of the collapse is
expected to become optically thick and requires us to follow the radiation
field in order to understand its subsequent evolution. So far, the adiabatic
approximation has been used exclusively for this purpose. We apply radiative
transfer in the flux-limited diffusion (FLD) approximation to solve the
evolution of coupled gas and radiation, for isolated halos. For direct collapse
within isolated DM halos, we find that (1) the photosphere forms at ~10^{-6} pc
and rapidly expands outward. (2) A central core forms, with a mass of ~1 Mo,
supported by thermal gas pressure gradients and rotation. (3) Growing thermal
gas and radiation pressure gradients dissolve it. (4) This process is
associated with a strong anisotropic outflow, and another core forms nearby and
grows rapidly. (5) Typical radiation luminosity emerging from the photosphere
encompassing these cores is ~5 x 10^{37}-5 x 10^{38} erg/s, of order the
Eddington luminosity. (6) Two variability timescales are associated with this
process: a long one, which is related to the accretion flow within the central
~10^{-4}-10^{-3} pc, and ~0.1 yr, which is related to radiation diffusion. (7)
Adiabatic models have been run for comparison and their evolution differs
profoundly from that of the FLD models, by forming a central
geometrically-thick disk. Overall, an adiabatic equation of state is not a good
approximation to the advanced stage of direct collapse, mainly because the
radiation in the FLD is capable of escaping due to anisotropy in the optical
depth and associated gradients.

apply whenever the dominant corrections originate at tree level from quantum

equivalent to a certain inequality relating the free energies of black holes.
These entropy inequalities mandate new positivity bounds on the coefficients of
higher-dimension operators. One of these conditions implies that the
charge-to-mass ratio of an extremal black hole asymptotes to unity from above
for increasing mass. Consequently, large extremal black holes are unstable to
decay to smaller extremal black holes and the weak gravity conjecture is
automatically satisfied. Our findings generalize to arbitrary spacetime

with current experimental limits and projected future sensitivities. Our
results provide the most robust prediction for electroweak triplet Majorana

between two sources of power corrections yields a small total $1/M$ correction,
and a total cross section close to the universal limit for $M \gtrsim {\rm few}

introduce dependence on underlying strong dynamics. Using a leading chiral
logarithm evaluation, the total $1/M$ correction has a larger magnitude and
uncertainty than in the fermionic case, with a sign that further suppresses the
total cross section. These examples provide definite targets for future direct

compact sources have been repeatedly established. Depending on the variation in
temporal classes, compact sources exhibit different nonlinear features.
Sometimes they show low correlation/fractal dimension, but in other classes or
intervals of time they exhibit stochastic nature. This could be because the
accretion flow around a compact object is a nonlinear general relativistic
system involving magnetohydrodynamics. However, the more conventional way of
addressing a compact source is the analysis of its spectral state. Therefore,
the question arises: What is the connection of nonlinearity to the underlying
spectral properties of the flow when the nonlinear properties are related to
the associated transport mechanisms describing the geometry of the flow? The
present work is aimed at addressing this question. Based on the connection
between observed spectral and nonlinear (time series) properties of two X-ray
binaries: GRS 1915+105 and Sco X-1, we attempt to diagnose the underlying
accretion modes of the sources in terms of known accretion classes, namely,
Keplerian disc, slim disc, advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF) and
general advective accretion flow (GAAF). We explore the possible transition of
the sources from one accretion mode to others with time. We further argue that
the accretion rate must play an important role in transition between these
modes.

limit on $M_{\nu}$ is tighter than the $\Lambda$CDM limit because of the
well-known degeneracy between $w$ and $M_{\nu}$. The Bayesian analysis we have
carried out then integrates over the possible values of $w_0$-$w_a$ such that
$w(z)\geq-1$, all of which correspond to tighter limits on $M_{\nu}$ than the
$\Lambda$CDM limit. We find a 95\% confidence level (C.L.) upper bound of
$M_{\nu}<0.13\,\mathrm{eV}$. This bound can be compared with
$M_{\nu}<0.16\,\mathrm{eV}$ at 95\%~C.L., obtained within the $\Lambda$CDM
model, and $M_{\nu}<0.41\,\mathrm{eV}$ at 95\%~C.L., obtained in a DDE model
with arbitrary EoS (which allows values of $w < -1$). Contrary to the results
derived for DDE models with arbitrary EoS, we find that a dark energy component
with $w(z)\geq-1$ is unable to alleviate the tension between high-redshift
observables and direct measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$. Finally, in
light of the results of this analysis, we also discuss the implications for DDE

overcome this problem. To that end we quantify how much the dominant part of
the MPS/CTM transfer matrix spectrum deviates from being continuous. The latter
is necessary to capture the exact asymptotics of the correlation function where
the exponential decay is typically modified by an additional algebraic term. By
extrapolating such a refinement parameter to zero, we show that we are able to
recover the exact value of the correlation length with high accuracy. In a
generic setting, our method reduces the error by a factor of $\sim 100$ as
compared to the results without extrapolation and a factor of $\sim 10$ as
compared to simple extrapolation schemes using bond dimension. We test our
approach in a number of solvable models both in 1d and 2d. Subsequently, we
apply it to 1d XXZ spin-$\frac32$ and the Bose-Hubbard models in a massive

measurements of the total matter power spectrum from the Horizon cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations: a dark matter-only run, one with full baryonic
physics, and another lacking Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback. Baryons
cause a suppression of power at $k\simeq 10$ $h/$Mpc of $<15\%$ at $z=0$, and
an enhancement of a factor of a few at smaller scales due to the more efficient
cooling and star formation. The results are sensitive to the presence of the
highest mass haloes in the simulation and the distribution of dark matter is
also impacted up to a few percent. The redshift evolution of the effect is
non-monotonic throughout $z=0-5$ due to an interplay between AGN feedback and
gas pressure, and the growth of structure. We investigate the effectiveness of
an analytic `baryonic correction model' in describing our results. We require a
different redshift evolution and propose an alternative fitting function with
$4$ free parameters that reproduces our results within $5\%$. Compared to other

  Networks under Correlated Blocking","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In localization applications, the line-of-sight between anchors and targets
may be blocked by obstacles in the environment. A target that is invisible
(i.e., without line-of-sight) to a sufficient number of anchors cannot be
unambiguously localized and is, therefore, said to be in a blind spot. In this
paper, we analyze the blind spot probability of a typical target by using
stochastic geometry to model the randomness in the obstacle and anchor
locations. In doing so, we handle correlated anchor blocking induced by the
obstacles, unlike previous works that assume independent anchor blocking. We
first characterize the regime over which the independent blocking assumption
underestimates the blind spot probability of the typical target, which in turn,
is characterized as a function of the distribution of the visible area,
surrounding the target location. Since this distribution is difficult to
characterize exactly, we formulate the nearest two-obstacle approximation,
which is equivalent to considering correlated blocking for only the nearest two
obstacles from the target and assuming independent blocking for the remaining
obstacles. Based on this, we derive an approximate expression for the blind
spot probability, which helps determine the anchor deployment intensity needed
for the blind spot probability of a typical target to be at most a threshold,
$\mu$.

method has been used to study the flow. The Simplified Bernoulli Trials (SBT)
collision scheme has been employed to reduce the computational costs and
required amounts of the computer resources. The effects of various divergence
angles on flow and thermal fields have been studied for different Knudsen
numbers in late-slip and early-transition regimes. The inlet-to-outlet pressure
ratio has been set to 2.5 for micro and nano-channels with a uniform constant
wall temperature. By analyzing the numerical results no flow separation has
been found due to slip at the wall which is different than flow behavior in
continuum regime. The results indicate that the viscous component has a
relatively large contribution to the overall pressure drop and flow behavior.
It observed that for low divergence angles the effects of pressure forces
dominate the effects of shear stress and divergence angle and cause the flow to
accelerate along the channel while by increasing the divergence angle and
therefore the effects of flow expansion, the flow decelerates along the
channel. The mass flow rate through channel increases by increasing the
divergence angle. Cold-to-hot heat transfer has been observed in diverging
micro and nano-channels. In order to investigate the thermal behavior in
diverging micro and nano-channels, the results have been compared to weakly

rollercoaster can be defined as a polygonal path for which every maximal
sub-path, with positive- or negative-slope edges, has at least three points.
Given a sequence of distinct real numbers, the rollercoaster problem asks for a
maximum-length subsequence that is a rollercoaster. It was conjectured that
every sequence of $n$ distinct real numbers contains a rollercoaster of length
at least $\lceil n/2\rceil$ for $n>7$, while the best known lower bound is
$\Omega(n/\log n)$. In this paper we prove this conjecture. Our proof is
constructive and implies a linear-time algorithm for computing a rollercoaster
of this length. Extending the $O(n\log n)$-time algorithm for computing a
longest increasing subsequence, we show how to compute a maximum-length
rollercoaster within the same time bound. A maximum-length rollercoaster in a
permutation of $\{1,\dots,n\}$ can be computed in $O(n \log \log n)$ time.
  The search for rollercoasters was motivated by orthogeodesic point-set

stellar populations with star formation ending at reionization. Yet as the
observations of these galaxies continue to improve, their star formation
histories (SFHs) are revealed to be more complicated than previously thought.
In this paper, we study how star formation, chemical enrichment, and mixing
proceed in small, dark matter halos at early times using a high-resolution,
cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation. The goals are to inform the future use
of analytic models and to explore observable properties of the simulated halos
in the context of UFD data. Specifically, we look at analytic approaches that
might inform metal enrichment within and beyond small galaxies in the early
Universe. We find that simple assumptions for modeling the extent of
supernova-driven winds agree with the simulation on average whereas
inhomogeneous mixing and gas flows have a large effect on the spread in
simulated stellar metallicities. In the context of the UFDs, this work
demonstrates that simulations can form halos with a complex SFH and a large
spread in the metallicity distribution function within a few hundred Myr in the
early Universe. In particular, bursty and continuous star formation are seen in
the simulation and both scenarios have been argued from the data. Spreads in
the simulated metallicities, however remain too narrow and too metal-rich when
compared to the UFDs. Future work is needed to help reduce these discrepancies
and advance our interpretation of the data.

approximately 0.5 and 0.1 solar mass. Many of them show surface activity
qualitatively similar to our Sun and generate flares, high X-ray fluxes, and
large-scale magnetic fields. Such activity is driven by a dynamo powered by the
convective motions in their interiors. Understanding properties of stellar
magnetic fields in these stars finds a broad application in astrophysics,
including, e.g., theory of stellar dynamos and environment conditions around
planets that may be orbiting these stars. Most stars with convective envelopes
follow a rotation-activity relationship where various activity indicators
saturate in stars with rotation periods shorter than a few days. The activity
gradually declines with rotation rate in stars rotating more slowly. It is
thought that due to a tight empirical correlation between X-ray and magnetic
flux, the stellar magnetic fields will also saturate, to values around ~4kG.
Here we report the detection of magnetic fields above the presumed saturation
limit in four fully convective M-dwarfs. By combining results from
spectroscopic and polarimetric studies we explain our findings in terms of
bistable dynamo models: stars with the strongest magnetic fields are those in a
dipole dynamo state, while stars in a multipole state cannot generate fields
stronger than about four kilogauss. Our study provides observational evidence
that dynamo in fully convective M dwarfs generates magnetic fields that can
differ not only in the geometry of their large scale component, but also in the

existence of exponentially localized Wannier functions and numerical algorithms
for finding them are well studied. In contrast, for systems with entangled band
structure, Wannier functions must be generalized to span a subspace larger than
the spectral subspace of interest to achieve favorable spatial locality. In
this setting, little is known about the theoretical properties of these Wannier
functions, and few algorithms can find them robustly. We develop a variational
formulation to compute these generalized maximally localized Wannier functions.
When paired with an initial guess based on the selected columns of the density
matrix (SCDM) method, our method can robustly find Wannier functions for
systems with entangled band structure. We formulate the problem as a
constrained nonlinear optimization problem, and show how the widely used
disentanglement procedure can be interpreted as a splitting method to
approximately solve this problem. We demonstrate the performance of our method
using real materials including silicon, copper, and aluminum. To examine more
precisely the localization properties of Wannier functions, we study the free

y directions. In the ""liquidlike"" regime of the supercritical phase, particles
are distributed in distinct layers along the z with layer spacing less than one
atomic diameter and the lateral RDF showing amorphous-like structure for
specific spacings (packing frustration). Increasing the rigidity of the
atomistic walls is found to lead to stronger layering and increased structural
order. For confinement with reflective walls, layers are found to form with one
atomic diameter spacing and the lateral RDF showing close-packed structure for
the smaller confinements. Translational order parameter and excess entropy
assessment confirm the ordering taking place for atomistic wall and reflective
wall confinements. In the ""gaslike"" regime of the supercritical phase, particle
distribution along the spacing and the lateral RDF exhibit features not
significantly different from that due to the normal gas regime. The
heterogeneity across FL, found to be present both in bulk and confined systems,
might cause the breakdown of the universal scaling between structure and
dynamics of fluids necessitating the determination of a unique relationship
between them.

framework for finding effective architectural building blocks for convolutional

close to state-of-the-art in performance. In addition, the models discovered by
our approach are also smaller than models discovered by similar techniques. We
achieve these twin advantages by designing our search space in such a way that
it searches over a reduced set of state-of-the-art building blocks for CNNs

become indispensable in applications of Kohn-Sham density functional theory. We
present an in-depth assessment of the fit parameters present in semiclassical
(D3-type) dispersion corrections by means of a statistically rigorous analysis.
We find that the choice of the cost function generally has a small effect on
the empirical parameters of D3-type dispersion corrections with respect to the
reference set under consideration. Only in a few cases, the choice of cost
function has a surprisingly large effect on the total dispersion energies. In
particular, the weighting scheme in the cost function can significantly affect
the reliability of predictions. In order to obtain unbiased (data-independent)
uncertainty estimates for both the empirical fit parameters and the
corresponding predictions, we carried out a nonparametric bootstrap analysis.
The mean prediction uncertainty obtained by bootstrapping is not much larger
than previously reported error measures. On the basis of a jackknife analysis,
we find that the original reference set is slightly skewed, but our results
also suggest that this feature hardly affects the prediction of dispersion
energies. However, a rigorous analysis of error accumulation arising from
different parameterizations reveals that error cancellation does not
necessarily occur, leading to a monotonically increasing deviation in the
dispersion energy with increasing molecule size. We discuss this issue in
detail at the prominent example of the C60 buckycatcher. We find deviations
between individual parameterizations of several tens of kcal/mol in some cases.
Hence, in combination with any calculation of dispersion energies, we recommend
to always determine the associated uncertainties for which we will provide a
software tool.

especially visible in coronal holes. Evidence is mounting that jets are part of
a continuum of eruptions that extends to much larger coronal mass ejections and
eruptive flares. Because coronal-hole jets originate in relatively simple
magnetic structures, they offer an ideal testbed for theories of energy buildup
and release in the full range of solar eruptions. We analyzed an equatorial
coronal-hole jet observed by SDO/AIA on 09 January 2014, in which the
magnetic-field structure was consistent with the embedded-bipole topology that
we identified and modeled previously as an origin of coronal jets. In addition,
this event contained a mini-filament, which led to important insights into the
energy storage and release mechanisms. SDO/HMI magnetograms revealed footpoint
motions in the primary minority-polarity region at the eruption site, but show
negligible flux emergence or cancellation for at least 16 hours before the
eruption. Therefore, the free energy powering this jet probably came from
magnetic shear concentrated at the polarity inversion line within the embedded
bipole. We find that the observed activity sequence and its interpretation
closely match the predictions of the breakout jet model, strongly supporting
the hypothesis that the breakout model can explain solar eruptions on a wide
range of scales.

predefined combinations (patterns) of events in massive data streams. As new
events are accepted, they are matched using some type of evaluation structure,
commonly optimized according to the statistical properties of the data items in
the input stream. However, in many real-life scenarios the data characteristics
are never known in advance or are subject to frequent on-the-fly changes. To
modify the evaluation structure as a reaction to such changes, adaptation
mechanisms are employed. These mechanisms typically function by monitoring a
set of properties and applying a new evaluation plan when significant deviation
from the initial values is observed. This strategy often leads to missing
important input changes or it may incur substantial computational overhead by
over-adapting. In this paper, we present an efficient and precise method for
dynamically deciding whether and how the evaluation structure should be
reoptimized. This method is based on a small set of constraints to be satisfied
by the monitored values, defined such that a better evaluation plan is
guaranteed if any of the constraints is violated. To the best of our knowledge,
our proposed mechanism is the first to provably avoid false positives on
reoptimization decisions. We formally prove this claim and demonstrate how our
method can be applied on known algorithms for evaluation plan generation. Our
extensive experimental evaluation on real-world datasets confirms the
superiority of our strategy over existing methods in terms of performance and
accuracy.

Characteristic decay times in dipole-allowed fluorescent transitions are much
faster than mechanical conformational changes within an environment and, as the
result, the latter can be assumed static during the emission process. However,
slow-decaying compounds can break this commonly accepted approximation and
introduce new interaction regimes. Here, slow decaying phosphorescent compounds
are proposed to perform quantum sensing of nearby structure's motion via
observation of collective velocity-dependent lifetime distributions. In
particular, characteristic decay of an excited dye molecule, being comparable
with its passage time next to a resonant particle, is modified via
time-dependent Purcell enhancement, which leaves distinct signatures on
properties of emitted light. Velocity mapping of uniformly moving particles

of dark matter known as MOG in the literature. The galaxy model in MOG has the
same initial conditions as in galaxy models with dark matter halo. On the other
hand, the initial random velocities and the Toomre's local stability parameter
are the same for all the models. We show that the evolution and growth of the
bar in MOG is substantially different from the standard cases including dark
matter halo. More importantly, we find that the bar growth rate and its final
magnitude is smaller in MOG. On the other hand, the maximum value of the bar in
MOG is smaller than the Newtonian models. It is shown that although the live
dark matter halo may support the bar instability, MOG has stabilizing effects.
Furthermore, we show that MOG supports fast pattern speeds, and unlike in the

incorporating boundary information derived from deep contextual learning to
LOGISMOS - layered optimal graph image segmentation of multiple objects and
surfaces. Accurate and reliable tumor segmentation is essential to tumor growth
analysis and treatment selection. A fully convolutional network (FCN), UNet, is
first trained using three adjacent 2D patches centered at the tumor, providing
contextual UNet segmentation and probability map for each 2D patch. The UNet
segmentation is then refined by Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and morphological
operations. The refined UNet segmentation is used to provide the initial shape
boundary to build a segmentation graph. The cost for each node of the graph is
determined by the UNet probability maps. Finally, a max-flow algorithm is
employed to find the globally optimal solution thus obtaining the final
segmentation. For evaluation, we applied the method to pancreatic tumor
segmentation on a dataset of 51 CT scans, among which 30 scans were used for
training and 21 for testing. With Deep LOGISMOS, DICE Similarity Coefficient

  Analysis",,,,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Independent component analysis (ICA) is a widely used BSS method that can
uniquely achieve source recovery, subject to only scaling and permutation
ambiguities, through the assumption of statistical independence on the part of
the latent sources. Independent vector analysis (IVA) extends the applicability
of ICA by jointly decomposing multiple datasets through the exploitation of the
dependencies across datasets. Though both ICA and IVA algorithms cast in the
maximum likelihood (ML) framework enable the use of all available statistical
information in reality, they often deviate from their theoretical optimality
properties due to improper estimation of the probability density function
(PDF). This motivates the development of flexible ICA and IVA algorithms that
closely adhere to the underlying statistical description of the data. Although
it is attractive minimize the assumptions, important prior information about
the data, such as sparsity, is usually available. If incorporated into the ICA
model, use of this additional information can relax the independence
assumption, resulting in an improvement in the overall separation performance.
Therefore, the development of a unified mathematical framework that can take
into account both statistical independence and sparsity is of great interest.
In this work, we first introduce a flexible ICA algorithm that uses an
effective PDF estimator to accurately capture the underlying statistical
properties of the data. We then discuss several techniques to accurately
estimate the parameters of the multivariate generalized Gaussian distribution,
and how to integrate them into the IVA model. Finally, we provide a
mathematical framework that enables direct control over the influence of
statistical independence and sparsity, and use this framework to develop an
effective ICA algorithm that can jointly exploit these two forms of diversity.

basis mismatch problem, which prevents accurate channel reconstruction and
degrades the precoding performance. This paper formulates mmWave channel
estimation as an Atomic Norm Minimization (ANM) problem. In contrast to
grid-based CS methods which use discrete dictionaries, ANM uses a continuous
dictionary for representing the mmWave channel. We consider a continuous
dictionary based on sub-sampling in the antenna domain via a small number of
radio frequency chains. We show that mmWave channel estimation using ANM can be
formulated as a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem, and the user channel
can be accurately estimated via off-the-shelf SDP solvers in polynomial time.
Simulation results indicate that ANM can achieve much better estimation
accuracy compared to grid-based CS, and significantly improves the spectral

that for interactions associated with a stronger dependence on velocity, dark
matter and baryons stay thermally coupled for longer, but the interaction
strengths are suppressed at the low temperatures relevant for Planck
observations and are thus less constrained. At the same time, cross sections
with stronger velocity dependencies are more constrained in the limit of small
dark matter mass. In all cases, the effect of dark matter-proton scattering is
most prominent on small scales in the CMB power spectra and in the matter power

play an important role at the high-luminosity circular electron-positron

precise value of the pure electromagnetic coupling constant
$\alpha_{QED}(M_Z)$, which is vitally important for overall tests of the

carefully calibrated and validated on selected ground-state properties that is
suitable for large-scale calculations of nuclear properties. The first
component of this functional is a non-local functional of the density and
corresponds to the direct part (Hartree term) of the expectation value of local
chiral potentials on a Slater determinant. A second component is a local
functional of the density and is obtained by applying the density matrix
expansion to the exchange part (Fock term) of the expectation value of the
local chiral potential. We apply the UNEDF2 optimization protocol to determine
the coupling constants of this energy functional. We obtain a set of

leading-order up to next-to-next-to-leading order with and without three-body
forces and contributions from $\Delta$ excitations. These functionals are
validated on the calculation of nuclear and neutron matter, nuclear mass

accurate segmentation remains a challenge in the presence of cell clusters and
pathologies. Moreover, previous classification methods are only built upon the
extraction of hand-crafted features, such as morphology and texture. This paper
addresses these limitations by proposing a method to directly classify cervical
cells - without prior segmentation - based on deep features, using
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). First, the ConvNet is pre-trained on
a natural image dataset. It is subsequently fine-tuned on a cervical cell
dataset consisting of adaptively re-sampled image patches coarsely centered on
the nuclei. In the testing phase, aggregation is used to average the prediction
scores of a similar set of image patches. The proposed method is evaluated on
both Pap smear and LBC datasets. Results show that our method outperforms
previous algorithms in classification accuracy (98.3%), area under the curve
(AUC) (0.99) values, and especially specificity (98.3%), when applied to the
Herlev benchmark Pap smear dataset and evaluated using five-fold

applications. End-side services, such as intelligent personal assistants,
autonomous cars, and smart home services often employ either simple local
models on the mobile or complex remote models on the cloud. However, recent
studies have shown that partitioning the DNN computations between the mobile
and cloud can increase the latency and energy efficiencies. In this paper, we
propose an efficient, adaptive, and practical engine, JointDNN, for
collaborative computation between a mobile device and cloud for DNNs in both
inference and training phase. JointDNN not only provides an energy and
performance efficient method of querying DNNs for the mobile side but also
benefits the cloud server by reducing the amount of its workload and
communications compared to the cloud-only approach. Given the DNN architecture,
we investigate the efficiency of processing some layers on the mobile device
and some layers on the cloud server. We provide optimization formulations at
layer granularity for forward- and backward-propagations in DNNs, which can
adapt to mobile battery limitations and cloud server load constraints and
quality of service. JointDNN achieves up to 18 and 32 times reductions on the
latency and mobile energy consumption of querying DNNs compared to the
status-quo approaches, respectively.

to maximize a sum utility subject to the QoS constraints, expressed as minimum
mean-rate or maximum mean-delay. Since we consider dynamic interference
coordination jointly with dynamic user association, the problem is not convex,
even after integer relaxation. We translate the problem into an optimization of
frame rates, amenable to a decomposition into intertwined primal and dual
problems. The solution to this optimization problem provides joint decisions on
scheduling, dynamic interference coordination, and, importantly, unlike most

novel method to manage infeasible loads. Extensive simulations confirm that the
design responds to instantaneous loads, heterogeneous user and AP locations,

analyzing plastic deformation in metals and alloys at elevated temperatures.
The two-dimensional approach, however, only accounts for the dislocation
climbing process, and it assumes that dislocation bypassing and shearing of
precipitates are negligible. To examine the validity of this assumption, this
study quantifies dislocation bypassing and shearing of precipitates in terms of
critical resolved shear stress, interaction time, and thermal activation energy
for various precipitate strength levels, temperatures, and precipitate
spacings. This study uses a modified dislocation dynamics approach that
accounts for shearable and non-shearable precipitates. Simulations focus on the
overdriven dislocation dynamics regime wherein the climbing process is limited
by fast interactions between dislocations and precipitates. The results show
that even though the resolved shear stress level required for a dislocation to
overcome an array of precipitates decreases at higher temperatures, the
interaction time between the dislocation and the precipitates increases. In
addition, the maximum ratio of thermal activation energy to the precipitate
energy barrier is only 0.15.

$\eta/s$ in a Fermi gas in the unitary limit. We show that in addition to a

more interesting result exists in the violation of the $\eta/s$ lower bound due

laser ablation technology was applied to generate different microstructures
(microgrooves and microcavities) on poly (L-lactide) (PLLA), where orientation,
cell shape and MSCs co-differentiation were investigated. On flat PLLA, the
undifferentiated MSCs showed rounded or elongated shapes, the latter being
randomly oriented. On PLLA microgrooves however, MSCs adapted their shape to
the groove size and direction and occasionally anchored to groove edges. It was
found that adipocytes, contrary to osteoblasts, are highly sensitive to
topological cues. Adipocytes responded to changes in substrate height and
depth, by adapting the intracellular distribution of their lipid vacuoles to
these physical constraints. In addition, the modification of PLLA by laser
ablation enhanced the adherence of differentiated cells to the substrate. These
findings show that picosecond pulsed laser micromachining can be applied to
directly manufacture 3D microstructures that guide cell proliferation, control
adipocyte morphology and improve the adhesion of bone and fat tissue.

(MOSVAs hereafter) defined in [H3], a noncommutative generalization of vertex
(operator) algebra. We start by recalling the definition of a MOSVA $V$ and
left $V$-modules in [H3]. Then we define right $V$-modules and $V$-bimodules
that reflect the noncommutative nature of $V$. When $V$ satisfies a condition
on the order of poles of the correlation function (which we call pole-order
condition), we prove that the rationality of products of two vertex operators
implies the rationality of products of any numbers of vertex operators. Also,
the rationality of iterates of any numbers of vertex operators is established,
and is used to construct the opposite MOSVA $V^{op}$ of $V$. It is proved here
that right (resp. left) $V$-modules are equivalent to left (resp. right)
$V^{op}$-modules. Using this equivalence, we prove that if $V$ and a
grading-restricted left $V$-module $W$ is endowed with a M\""obius structure,
then the graded dual $W'$ of $W$ is a right $V$-module. This proof is the only
place in this paper that needs the grading-restriction condition. Also, this
result is generalized to not-grading-restricted modules under a strong
pole-order condition that is satisfied by all existing examples of MOSVAs and
modules.

  matrices",,,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper deals with two related problems, namely distance-preserving binary
embeddings and quantization for compressed sensing . First, we propose fast
methods to replace points from a subset $\mathcal{X} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$,
associated with the Euclidean metric, with points in the cube $\{\pm 1\}^m$ and
we associate the cube with a pseudo-metric that approximates Euclidean distance
among points in $\mathcal{X}$. Our methods rely on quantizing fast
Johnson-Lindenstrauss embeddings based on bounded orthonormal systems and
partial circulant ensembles, both of which admit fast transforms. Our
quantization methods utilize noise-shaping, and include Sigma-Delta schemes and
distributed noise-shaping schemes. The resulting approximation errors decay
polynomially and exponentially fast in $m$, depending on the embedding method.
This dramatically outperforms the current decay rates associated with binary
embeddings and Hamming distances. Additionally, it is the first such binary
embedding result that applies to fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss maps while
preserving $\ell_2$ norms.
  Second, we again consider noise-shaping schemes, albeit this time to quantize
compressed sensing measurements arising from bounded orthonormal ensembles and
partial circulant matrices. We show that these methods yield a reconstruction
error that again decays with the number of measurements (and bits), when using
convex optimization for reconstruction. Specifically, for Sigma-Delta schemes,
the error decays polynomially in the number of measurements, and it decays
exponentially for distributed noise-shaping schemes based on beta encoding.
These results are near optimal and the first of their kind dealing with bounded
orthonormal systems.

complement data-driven machine learning in heterogeneous data. One of the most
effective methods in representing knowledge graphs is to embed symbolic
relations and entities into continuous spaces, where relations are
approximately linear translation between projected images of entities in the
relation space. However, state-of-the-art relation projection methods such as
TransR, TransD or TransSparse do not model the correlation between relations,
and thus are not scalable to complex knowledge graphs with thousands of
relations, both in computational demand and in statistical robustness. To this
end we introduce TransF, a novel translation-based method which mitigates the
burden of relation projection by explicitly modeling the basis subspaces of
projection matrices. As a result, TransF is far more light weight than the
existing projection methods, and is robust when facing a high number of
relations. Experimental results on the canonical link prediction task show that
our proposed model outperforms competing rivals by a large margin and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Especially, TransF improves by 9%/5% in the

found to be $T_{\rm eff,1}$ = 9310 $\pm$ 90 K by a comparison of the observed
spectra and the Kurucz models. The physical parameters of W UMi were derived by
an analysis of our RV data together with the multi-band light curves of
Devinney et al. (1970). The individual masses, radii, and luminosities of both

severe disadvantages since the PEC cell is connected in series to the PV cell

multi-terminal hybrid PV and PEC system (HPEV). As in tandem arrangements, the
PEC cell is optically connected in series with the PV cell. However, a second
back contact is used to extract the PV cell surplus current and allow parallel
production of both electrical power and chemical fuel. Devices consisting of

We make
an attempt to answer one fundamental question: Is such binary branching from
the coarsest to the finest scales sustained by data? We convert this question
into an equivalent one: where is the structural information of tree in a data
matrix? Results from this conceptual as well as computing issue afford us to
conclude a negative answer: Each branch being split into two at each inter-node
of tree from the top to bottom levels is a man-made structure. The data-driven
computing paradigm Data Mechanics is employed here to reveal that information
of tree is composed of a set of selected temperatures (or scales), each of
which has a clustering composition strictly regulated by a temperature-specific
cluster-sharing probability matrix. The resultant Data Cloud Geometry (DCG)
tree on the space of species is proposed as the authentic structure contained
in data. Particularly each core clusters on the finest scale, the bottom level,
of DCG tree should not be further partitioned because of uniformity. Beyond the
finest scale, the branching of DCG tree is primarily based on probability,
which induces an Ultrametric satisfying super triangular inequality property.
This Ultrametric property differentiates DCG tree from all popular trees based
on Hierarchical clustering (HC) algorithm, which typically employs an
empirical, often ad hoc distance measure. Since this measure is regulated by
the triangular inequality, it is not capable of producing a ""flat"" branch, in
which all its members (more than two) have equal distances to each others. We
demonstrate such information content on an illustrative zoo data first, and

Different application components are often written in different languages using
different abstractions and frameworks. Often, additional components, such as a
message broker (e.g. Kafka), are required to decouple data production and
consumptions and avoiding issues, such as back-pressure. Streaming applications
may be extremely dynamic due to factors, such as variable data rates caused by
the data source, adaptive sampling techniques or network congestions, variable
processing loads caused by usage of different machine learning algorithms. As a
result application-level resource management that can respond to changes in one

supporting streaming frameworks, applications and their resource management
needs on HPC infrastructure. Pilot-Streaming is based on the Pilot-Job concept

the quantum phase of the quantum annealer and the classical post-processing
phase typically used to enhance each solution returned by DW. We demonstrate
that on random graphs that fit DW, no quantum speedup can be observed compared

kinetic collisionless magnetorotational instability (MRI) in weakly magnetized
(high $\beta$) pair plasma. The central result of this numerical analysis is
the emergence of a self-induced turbulent regime in the saturation state of the
collisionless MRI, which can only be captured for large enough simulation
domains. One of the underlying mechanisms for the development of this turbulent
state is the drift-kink instability (DKI) of the current sheets resulting from
the nonlinear evolution of the channel modes. The onset of the DKI can only be
observed for simulation domain sizes exceeding several linear MRI wavelengths.
The DKI, together with ensuing magnetic reconnection, activate the turbulent
motion of the plasma in the late stage of the nonlinear evolution of the MRI.
At steady state, the magnetic energy has an MHD-like spectrum with a slope of
$k^{-5/3}$ for $k\rho<1$ and $k^{-3}$ for sub-Larmor scale ($k\rho>1$). We also
examine the role of the collisionless MRI and associated magnetic reconnection
in the development of pressure anisotropy. We study the stability of the system
due to this pressure anisotropy, observing the development of mirror
instability during the early-stage of the MRI. We further discuss the
importance of magnetic reconnection for particle acceleration during the
turbulence regime. In particular, consistent with reconnection studies, we show
that at late times the kinetic energy presents a characteristic slope of
$\epsilon^{-2}$ in the high-energy region.

(CSM) interaction in an ordinary supernova, pulsational pair-instability
supernovae (PPISN), and magnetar formation. Each is able to explain the
enduring emission and brightness of iPTF14hls, but has shortcomings when
confronted with other observed characteristics. The PPISN model can, in some
cases, produce a presupernova transient like the one observed at the site of
iPTF14hls in 1954. It also offers a clear path to providing the necessary half
solar mass of material at $\sim 5 \times 10^{16}$ cm for CSM interaction to
work, and can give an irregular light curve without invoking additional
assumptions. It explains the 4000 km s$^{-1}$ seen in the iron lines, but
without additional energy input, strains to explain the nearly constant 8000 km
s$^{-1}$ velocity seen in H$_{\alpha}$. Magnetar models can also explain many
of the observed features, but give a smooth light curve and may require an
evolving magnetic field strength. Their dynamics may be difficult to reconcile
with the observation of slow-moving hydrogen at late times. The various models
predict different spectral characteristics and a remnant that, today, could be
a black hole, magnetar, or even a star. Further observations and calculations

from the Fock terms is demonstrated, specifically via the isoscalar
meson-nucleon coupling channels. The reservation of $S_4$ and higher-order

prediction of neutron star properties, which is illustrated in the quantities
such as the proton fraction, the core-crust transition density as well as the
fraction of crustal moment of inertia. Since the Fock terms enhance the density
dependence of the thermodynamical potential, the RHF calculations predict
systematically smaller values of density, proton fraction and pressure at the
core-crust transition boundary of neutron stars than density dependent RMF
ones. In addition, a linear anti-correlation between the core-crust transition
density $\rho_t$ and the density slope of symmetry energy $L$ is found which is
then utilized to constrain the core-crust transition density as

recognition as the recognition of basic visually primitives that are composed
according to well-defined rules. This strategy allows us to recognize unseen
complex concepts from simple visual primitives. However, the current trend in
visual recognition follows a data greedy approach where huge amounts of data
are required to learn models for any desired visual concept. In this paper, we
build on the compositionality principle and develop an ""algebra"" to compose
classifiers for complex visual concepts. To this end, we learn neural network
modules to perform boolean algebra operations on simple visual classifiers.
Since these modules form a complete functional set, a classifier for any
complex visual concept defined as a boolean expression of primitives can be
obtained by recursively applying the learned modules, even if we do not have a
single training sample. As our experiments show, using such a framework, we can
compose classifiers for complex visual concepts outperforming standard
baselines on two well-known visual recognition benchmarks. Finally, we present
a qualitative analysis of our method and its properties.

the expression levels of the genes in an organism. High throughput technology
has made such studies possible: in a given tissue sample, it enables us to
quantify the expression levels of approximately 20,000 genes and to record the
alleles present at millions of genetic polymorphisms. While obtaining this data
is relatively cheap once a specimen is at hand, obtaining human tissue remains
a costly endeavor. Thus, eQTL studies continue to be based on relatively small
sample sizes, with this limitation particularly serious for tissues of most
immediate medical relevance. Given the high dimensional nature of this datasets
and the large number of hypotheses tested, the scientific community has adopted
early on multiplicity adjustment procedures, which primarily control the false
discoveries rate for the identification of genetic variants with influence on
the expression levels. In contrast, a problem that has not received much
attention to date is that of providing estimates of the effect sizes associated
to these variants, in a way that accounts for the considerable amount of
selection. We illustrate how the recently developed conditional inference
approach can be deployed to obtain confidence intervals for the eQTL effect
sizes with reliable coverage. The procedure we propose is based on a randomized
hierarchical strategy that both reflects the steps typically adopted in state
of the art investigations and introduces the use of randomness instead of data
splitting to maximize the use of available data. Analysis of the GTEx Liver
dataset (v6) suggests that naively obtained confidence intervals would likely
not cover the true values of effect sizes and that the number of local genetic
polymorphisms influencing the expression level of genes might be
underestimated.

Scintillator (LS) neutrino detectors, where large target masses are pivotal to
compensate for neutrinos' extremely elusive nature. Depending on the detector
light yield, several scintillation photons stemming from the same neutrino
interaction are likely to hit a single PMT in a few tens/hundreds of
nanoseconds, resulting in several photoelectrons (PEs) to pile-up at the PMT
anode. In such scenario, the signal generated by each PE is entangled to the
others, and an accurate PMT charge reconstruction becomes challenging. This
manuscript describes an experimental method able to address the PMT charge
reconstruction in the case of large PE pile-up, providing an unbiased charge
estimator at the permille level up to 15 detected PEs. The method is based on a
signal filtering technique (Wiener filter) which suppresses the noise due to
both PMT and readout electronics, and on a Fourier-based deconvolution able to
minimize the influence of signal distortions ---such as an overshoot. The
analysis of simulated PMT waveforms shows that the slope of a linear regression
modeling the relation between reconstructed and true charge values improves
from $0.769 \pm 0.001$ (without deconvolution) to $0.989 \pm 0.001$ (with
deconvolution), where unitary slope implies perfect reconstruction. A C++

key to this efficiency is a general proximal calculus in the new metric. By
using duality, formulas are derived that relate the proximal mapping in a

implementations of the proximity calculation for a large class of functions;
the implementations exploit the piece-wise linear nature of the dual problem.
Then, we apply these results to acceleration of composite convex minimization
problems, which leads to elegant quasi-Newton methods for which we prove
convergence. The algorithm is tested on several numerical examples and compared
to a comprehensive list of alternatives in the literature. Our quasi-Newton

network architecture is proposed that combines a fully convolutional network
with an unrolled primal-dual network that can be trained end-to-end to achieve
state of the art binarization on four out of seven datasets. Document
binarization is formulated as an energy minimization problem. A fully
convolutional neural network is trained for semantic segmentation of pixels
that provides labeling cost associated with each pixel. This cost estimate is
refined along the edges to compensate for any over or under estimation of the
foreground class using a primal-dual approach. We provide necessary overview on
proximal operator that facilitates theoretical underpinning required to train a
primal-dual network using a gradient descent algorithm. Numerical instabilities
encountered due to the recurrent nature of primal-dual approach are handled. We
provide experimental results on document binarization competition dataset along
with network changes and hyperparameter tuning required for stability and
performance of the network. The network when pre-trained on synthetic dataset
performs better as per the competition metrics.

semilinear elliptic equations is of great importance because of the resulting
energy landscape and its implications for the various dynamics. In [AIKN3],
semilinear elliptic equations with combined power-type nonlinearities involving
the Sobolev critical exponent are studied. There, it is shown that if the
dimension is four or higher, and the frequency is sufficiently small, then the
positive radial ground state is unique and nondegenerate. In this paper, we
extend these results to the case of high frequencies when the dimension is five
and higher. After suitably rescaling the equation, we demonstrate that the main
behavior of the solutions is given by the Sobolev critical part for which the
ground states are explicit, and their degeneracy is well characterized. Our
result is a key step towards the study of the different dynamics of solutions
of the corresponding nonlinear Schr\""odinger and Klein-Gordon equations with
energies above the energy of the ground state. Our restriction on the dimension
is mainly due to the existence of resonances in dimension three and four.

integrates all the information of different modalities into a joint
representation and then to generate one modality from the corresponding other
modality via this joint representation. We simply applied this approach to
variational autoencoders (VAEs), which we call a joint multimodal variational
autoencoder (JMVAE). However, we found that when this model attempts to
generate a large dimensional modality missing at the input, the joint
representation collapses and this modality cannot be generated successfully.
Furthermore, we confirmed that this difficulty cannot be resolved even using a
known solution. Therefore, in this study, we propose two models to prevent this
difficulty: JMVAE-kl and JMVAE-h. Results of our experiments demonstrate that
these methods can prevent the difficulty above and that they generate
modalities bi-directionally with equal or higher likelihood than conventional
VAE methods, which generate in only one direction. Moreover, we confirm that
these methods can obtain the joint representation appropriately, so that they
can generate various variations of modality by moving over the joint
representation or changing the value of another modality.

study their response to spiral arm perturbations. We find that, as expected,
disk populations with different kinematics respond differently to a spiral
perturbation, with the tendency for dynamically cooler populations to show a
larger fractional contribution to spiral arms than dynamically hotter
populations. By assuming a relation between kinematics and metallicity, namely
the hotter the population, the more metal-poor it is, this differential
response to the spiral arm perturbations naturally leads to azimuthal
variations in the mean metallicity of stars in the simulated disk. Thus,
azimuthal variations in the mean metallicity of stars across a spiral galaxy
are not necessarily a consequence of the reshaping, by radial migration, of an
initial radial metallicity gradient. They indeed arise naturally also in
stellar disks which have initially only a negative vertical metallicity
gradient.

and antagonistic interactions, respectively. Based on Perron-Frobenius property
of eventually positive matrices and LaSalle invariance principle, we conduct a
comprehensive theoretical analysis of the generalized nonlinear opinion
dynamics. We obtain some sufficient conditions such that the states of all
agents converge into the subspace spanned by the right positive eigenvector of
an eventually positive matrix. When there exists at least one entry of the
right positive eigenvector which is not equal to one, the derived results can
be used to describe different levels of an opinion. Finally, we present two
examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical findings.

to be 14100 +- 420 K for carbon, 400 +- 30 K for nitrogen, and 1440 +-160 K for
oxygen. The adsorption energy of oxygen is well consistent with experimentally
reported value. We found that the binding of a nitrogen atom is purely
physisorption, while that of a carbon atom is chemisorption in which a chemical
bond to an O atom of a water molecule is formed. That of an oxygen atom has a
dual character both physisorption and chemisorption. The chemisorption of
atomic carbon also implies a possibility of further chemical reactions to
produce molecules bearing a C-O bond, while it may hinder the formation of
methane on water ice via sequential hydrogenation of carbon atoms. These would
be of a large impact to the chemical evolution of carbon species in
interstellar environments. We also investigated effects of the newly calculated
adsorption energies onto chemical compositions of cold dense molecular clouds
with the aid of gas-ice astrochemical simulations. We found that abundances of
major nitrogen-bearing molecules, such as N2 and NH3, are significantly altered
by applying the calculated adsorption energy, because nitrogen atoms can
thermally diffuse on surfaces even at 10 K.

downloaded from Scopus or Web of Science. In this study, we present some

across a longer period (many citing years). The new methods are demonstrated in
this study using all the papers published in Scientometrics between 1978 and
2016. The indicators N_TOP50, N_TOP25, and N_TOP10 can be used to identify
those CRs which belong to the 50%, 25%, or 10% most frequently cited

Furthermore, the new version of CRExplorer analyzes the impact sequence of CRs
across citing years. CRs can have below average (-), average (0), or above
average (+) impact in citing years (whereby average is meant in the sense of
expected values). The sequence (e.g. 00++---0--00) is used by the program to
identify papers with typical impact distributions. For example, CRs can have

YqjI, Drm and Tal (pentose phosphate pathway). Biochemical assays, such as free
sulfhydryl, CoA-SH and malate dehydrogenase assays corroborated the observed
central metabolism reorientation and showed that Zn stress induced oxidative
stress, probably as a consequence of thiol chelation stress by Zn ions. The
other patterns affected by ZnO and ZnSO4 were the stringent response and the
general stress response. Nine proteins involved in or controlled by the
stringent response showed a modified expression profile in the presence of ZnO
NPs or ZnSO4: YwaC, SigH, YtxH, YtzB, TufA, RplJ, RpsB, PdhB and Mbl. An
increase in the ppGpp concentration confirmed the involvement of the stringent

Zn stress were probably the result of complex regulatory mechanisms including
at least the stringent response via YwaC.

failure in exfoliated single-crystal h-BN films were investigated using the
constant-voltage stress test. At low electrical fields, the current gradually
reduced and saturated with time, while the current increased at electrical
fields higher than ~8 MV/cm and finally resulted in the catastrophic dielectric
breakdown. These transient behaviors may be due to carrier trapping to the
defect sites in h-BN because trapped carriers lower or enhance the electrical
fields in h-BN depending on their polarities. The key finding is the current
enhancement with time at the high electrical field, suggesting the accumulation
of electrons generated by the impact ionization process. Therefore, a
theoretical model including the electron generation rate by impact ionization
process was developed. The experimental data support the expected degradation
mechanism of h-BN. Moreover, the impact ionization coefficient was successfully
extracted, which is comparable to that of SiO2, even though the fundamental
band gap for h-BN is smaller than that for SiO2. Therefore, the dominant impact
ionization in h-BN could be band-to-band excitation, not defect-assisted impact
ionization.

parameters are taken or inferred from earlier astronomical computation of

transition age, where mean lunar recession is suddenly lowered, and (ii) the
merging age, where Earth-Moon distance (EMD), drops to zero. Predicted mean EMD
and length of day (LOD) slightly overstimate their counterparts from the above
mentioned astronomical computation. Predicted LOD, where the effect of
atmospheric tides and nontidal processes is considered and supposed to be time
independent, slightly understimates a linear interpolation from paleontological
data related to Phanerozoic, inferred in earlier investigations. If
short-period ($\Delta t\approx10^{-3}$ Gyr) EMD fluctuations ($\Delta
a\approx\mp0.5R_\oplus$), resulting from the above mentioned astronomical
computation back to 0.25 Gyr, occur along the whole evolution of Earth-Moon
system (EMS), then the predicted mean EMD is consistent with values inferred
from three well studied paleontological data sets: Elatina-Reynella (ER), Big
Cottonwood (BC), Weeli Wolli (WW), for a suitable choice of input parameters.
The same holds for LOD where, in addition, computed values are consistent with
a linear interpolation from paleontological data related to Proterozoic,
inferred in earlier investigations. The effect of atmospheric tides and
nontidal processes is also discussed. In conclusion, the current model can be
considered as a useful zeroth-order approximation to the evaluation of lunar
recession and LOD. More accurate paleontological data, expecially in connection
with error evaluation, would be desirable in view of improved results and
further constraints involving both Astronomy and Paleontology.

the existing control depends on a number of parameters, that are currently

superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ is enhanced by proximity to the
ferroelectric instability from the disordered side, while it is generally
suppressed in the ordered phase due to its increase in dielectric stiffness and
a reduction of critical fluctuations from dipolar induced anisotropies. The

full dynamicity (i.e., users have the flexibility in joining and leaving the
group), and thus, resolve a prominent open problem posed by previous works.
Moreover, we achieve this non-trivial feat in a relatively simple manner.
Starting with Libert et al.'s fully static construction (Eurocrypt 2016) -
which is arguably the most efficient lattice-based group signature to date, we
introduce simple-but-insightful tweaks that allow to upgrade it directly into
the fully dynamic setting. More startlingly, our scheme even produces slightly
shorter signatures than the former, thanks to an adaptation of a technique
proposed by Ling et al. (PKC 2013), allowing to prove inequalities in
zero-knowledge. Our design approach consists of upgrading Libert et al.'s
static construction (EUROCRYPT 2016) - which is arguably the most efficient
lattice-based group signature to date - into the fully dynamic setting.
Somewhat surprisingly, our scheme produces slightly shorter signatures than the
former, thanks to a new technique for proving inequality in zero-knowledge
without relying on any inequality check. The scheme satisfies the strong
security requirements of Bootle et al.'s model (ACNS 2016), under the Short
Integer Solution (SIS) and the Learning With Errors (LWE) assumptions.
  Furthermore, we demonstrate how to equip the obtained group signature scheme
with the deniability functionality in a simple way. This attractive
functionality, put forward by Ishida et al. (CANS 2016), enables the tracing
authority to provide an evidence that a given user is not the owner of a
signature in question. In the process, we design a zero-knowledge protocol for
proving that a given LWE ciphertext does not decrypt to a particular message.

obtained with the VLA and ALMA interferometers. We find that HR5907 is the most
radio luminous early type star in the cm-mm band among those presently known.
Its multi-wavelength radio light curves are strongly variable with an amplitude
that increases with radio frequency. The radio emission can be explained by the
populations of the non-thermal electrons accelerated in the current sheets on
the outer border of the magnetosphere of this fast rotating magnetic star. We
classify HR5907 as another member of the growing class of strongly magnetic
fast rotating hot stars where the gyro-synchrotron emission mechanism
efficiently operates in their magnetospheres. The new radio observations of
HR5907 are combined with archival X-ray data to study the physical condition of
its magnetosphere. The X-ray spectra of HR5907 show tentative evidence for the
presence of non-thermal spectral component. We suggest that non-thermal X-rays
originate a stellar X-ray aurora due to streams of non-thermal electrons
impacting on the stellar surface. Taking advantage of the relation between the
spectral indices of the X-ray power-law spectrum and the non-thermal electron
energy distributions, we perform 3-D modeling of the radio emission for HR5907.
The wavelength-dependent radio light-curves probe magnetospheric layers at
different heights above the stellar surface. A detailed comparison between
simulated and observed radio light-curves leads us to conclude that the stellar
magnetic field of HR5907 is likely non-dipolar, providing further indirect
evidence of the complex magnetic field topology of HR5907.

The mathematical model consists of a Cahn-Hilliard equation, a Navier-Stokes
equation and the generalized Navier boundary condition for the moving contact
line. A scalar auxiliary variable is adopted to transform the governing system
into an equivalent form, allowing the double well potential to be treated
semi-explicitly. A stabilization term is added to balance the explicit
nonlinear term originating from the surface energy at fluid-solid interface. A
pressure stabilization method is used to decouple the computation of velocity
and pressure. Some subtle implicit-explicit treatments are adopted to deal with
convention and stress terms. We establish a rigorous proof of energy stability
for the proposed time-marching scheme. Then a finite difference method on
staggered grids is used to spatially discretize the constructed time-marching
scheme. We further prove that the fully discrete scheme also satisfies the
discrete energy dissipation law. Numerical results demonstrate accuracy and
energy stability of the proposed scheme. Using our numerical scheme, we analyze
the contact line dynamics through a shear flow driven droplet sliding case.
Three-dimensional droplet spreading is also investigated on a chemically
patterned surface. Our numerical simulation accurately predicts the expected
energy evolutions and it successfully reproduces expected phenomena that an oil
droplet contracts inwards on a hydrophobic zone and spreads outwards quickly on
a hydrophilic zone.

current implementation, the contribution of these dispersion corrections to the
dynamical matrices (with a number of elements that is proportional to the

evolution of planetary systems and the rotational dynamics of planets. However,
2D models commonly used for the Earth cannot be applied to extrasolar telluric
planets hosting potentially deep oceans because they ignore the
three-dimensional effects related to the ocean vertical structure. Our goal is
to investigate in a consistant way the importance of the contribution of
internal gravity waves in the oceanic tidal response and to propose a modeling
allowing to treat a wide range of cases from shallow to deep oceans. A 3D ab
initio model is developed to study the dynamics of a global planetary ocean.
This model takes into account compressibility, stratification and sphericity
terms, which are usually ignored in 2D approaches. An analytic solution is
computed and used to study the dependence of the tidal response on the tidal
frequency and on the ocean depth and stratification. In the 2D asymptotic
limit, we recover the frequency-resonant behaviour due to surface
inertial-gravity waves identified by early studies. As the ocean depth and
Brunt-V\""ais\""al\""a frequency increase, the contribution of internal gravity
waves grows in importance and the tidal response become three-dimensional. In
the case of deep oceans, the stable stratification induces resonances that can
increase the tidal dissipation rate by several orders of magnitude. It is thus
able to affect significantly the evolution time scale of the planetary
rotation.

While traditionally such networks are learned by a softmax or binary logistic

non-categorical embedding space. Thus, the cosine loss can be employed in this
non-categorical representation. Besides integrating image level annotations, it
is shown how to integrate point-wise annotations using a Spatial Pyramid

classification, point localization and weakly supervised bounding box
localization. It is shown that the combination of pointwise mutual information

88$\%$ into account. The depletion is investigated using the ratio of the
[FeII]~1.257~$\mu$m and [PII]~1.188~$\mu$m lines. Using the Pa$\beta$ and
Br$\gamma$ lines and a range in stellar mass and radius $\dot{M}_{acc}$ is
calculated to be (3 - 10) $\times$ 10$^{-8}$~\Msun~yr$^{-1}$. Comparing these
rates puts the jet efficiency in line with predictions of magneto-centrifugal
models of jet launching in low mass protostars. This is a further case of a
brown dwarf outflow exhibiting analogous properties to protostellar jets.

Here, we present a multi-frequency analysis of FBQS J1644+2619, one of the most
recently discovered gamma-ray emitting NLSy1s. We analyse an ~80 ks XMM-Newton
observation obtained in 2017, as well as quasi-simultaneous multi-wavelength
observations covering the radio - gamma-ray range. The spectral energy
distribution of the source is similar to the other gamma-ray NLSy1s, confirming
its blazar-like nature. The X-ray spectrum is characterised by a hard photon
index (Gamma = 1.66) above 2 keV and a soft excess at lower energies.The hard
photon index provides clear evidence that inverse Compton emission from the jet
dominates the spectrum, while the soft excess can be explained by a
contribution from the underlying Seyfert emission. This contribution can be
fitted by reflection of emission from the base of the jet, as well as by
Comptonisation in a warm, optically thick corona. We discuss our results in the
context of the other gamma-ray NLSy1s and note that the majority of them have
similar X-ray spectra, with properties intermediate between blazars and
radio-quiet NLSy1s.

The coupling is mediated by a far-off-resonant phonon cavity through virtual
excitations via a Raman-like process. By controlling the resonant frequency of
the phonon cavity, the indirect coupling can be tuned in a wide range. Our
results may lead to the development of gate-controlled all-mechanical devices

irreducible representations constrain the possibilities of Hilbert space
arithmetic, i.e.\ how a Hilbert space can be decomposed into sums of subspaces
and factored into products of subspaces. Partitioning the Hilbert space is
equivalent to parsing the system into subsystems, and these emergent subsystems
provide insight into the kinematics, dynamics, and informatics of a quantum

from irreducible representations that correspond to `natural' ontological units
like spins and particles. It also gives examples of the reverse process in
which complex models are partitioned into subsystems that are selected by the
representations of the symmetries and require no underlying ontological

this resource can be established between two and even more distant parties by
transmission of a system being separable from all the parties. For the case
with two parties, we design a protocol allowing to distribute one-way Gaussian
steering between them via a separable carrier; the obtained steering can be
used subsequently for one-sided device-independent (1sDI) quantum key
distribution. Further, we extend the protocol to three parties, a scenario
which exhibits richer steerability properties including one-to-multimode
steering and collective steering, and which can be used for 1sDI quantum secret
sharing. All the proposed steering distribution protocols can be implemented
with squeezed states, beam splitters and displacements, and thus they can be
readily realized experimentally. Our findings reveal that not only entanglement
but even steering can be distributed via communication of a separable system.
Viewed from a different perspective, the present protocols also demonstrate
that one can switch multipartite states between different steerability classes

The simulation of a dambreak problem numerically supports the correct energy

significantly upon a more traditional approach. Due to the excellent accuracy

verify the correctness of the translation, i.e., to prove that the MapReduce

for proving equivalence between imperative and MapReduce algorithms based on
partitioning the equivalence proof into a sequence of equivalence proofs

on the insight that two kinds of sub-proofs are required: (1) uniform
transformations changing the controlflow structure that are mostly independent

transformations that are not uniform but that preserve the overall structure

feasibility of our approach by evaluating it on two prototypical algorithms
commonly used as examples in MapReduce frameworks: k-means and PageRank. To
carry out the proofs, we use the interactive theorem prover Coq with partial

quarks and produced in association with a high-$p_{\textrm{T}}$ photon or jet.
The dataset consists of proton-proton collisions with an integrated luminosity
of 36.1 fb$^{-1}$ at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV recorded by
the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Resonance candidates are
identified as massive large-radius jets with substructure consistent with a
particle decaying into a quark pair. The mass spectrum of the candidates is
examined for local excesses above background. No evidence of a new resonance is
observed in the data, which are used to exclude the production of a
lepto-phobic axial-vector $Z^\prime$ boson.

class of nonlocal transport PDEs with nonlinear mobility arising in many
contexts in biology and social sciences. The approximating particle system is a
nonlocal version of the follow-the-leader scheme. We rigorously prove that a
suitable discrete piece-wise density reconstructed from the particle scheme
converges strongly in $L^1_{loc}$ towards the unique entropy solution to the
target PDE as the number of particles tends to infinity. The proof is based on
uniform BV estimates on the approximating sequence and on the verification of
an approximated version of the entropy condition for large number of particles.
As part of the proof, we also prove uniqueness of entropy solutions. We also
provide a specific example of non-uniqueness of weak solutions and discuss
about the interplay of the entropy condition with the steady states. Finally,
we produce numerical simulations supporting the need of a concept of entropy
solution in order to get a well-posed semigroup in the continuum limit, and
showing the behaviour of solutions for large times.

on high-dimensional data that is typically organized into multi-dimensional
tensors. Many existing frameworks, libraries, and domain-specific languages
support the development of efficient code for manipulating tensors and tensor
expressions. However, such frameworks and languages that are used in practice
often lack formal specifications. The present report formally defines a model
language for expressing tensor operations. The model language is simple and yet
general enough so that it captures the fundamental tensor operations common to
most existing languages and frameworks. It is shown that the given formal
semantics are sensible, in the sense that well-typed programs in the model
language execute correctly, without error. Moreover, an alternative
implementation of the model language is formally defined. The alternative
implementation introduces padding into the storage of tensors, which may
benefit performance on modern hardware platforms. Based on their formal
definitions, the original implementation of the model language and the
implementation with padding are proven equivalent. Finally, some possible
extensions of the presented model language for tensor manipulation are
discussed.

history and efficiency of the universe. We use our simulations to predict the

Whether the cosmological constant is successfully predicted depends crucially

that is a subgroup acting transitively on its vertices and its edges but not on
its arcs, are investigated. One of the most fruitful approaches for the study
of structural properties of such graphs is the well known paradigm of
alternating cycles and their intersections which was introduced by
Maru\v{s}i\v{c} 20 years ago.
  In this paper a new parameter for such graphs, giving a further insight into
their structure, is introduced. Various properties of this parameter are given
and the parameter is completely determined for the tightly attached examples in
which any two non-disjoint alternating cycles meet in half of their vertices.
Moreover, the obtained results are used to establish a link between two
frameworks for a possible classification of all tetravalent graphs admitting a
half-arc-transitive subgroup of automorphisms, the one proposed by
Maru\v{s}i\v{c} and Praeger in 1999, and the much more recent one proposed by
Al-bar, Al-kenai, Muthana, Praeger and Spiga which is based on the normal
quotients method.
  New results on the graph of alternating cycles of a tetravalent graph
admitting a half-arc-transitive subgroup of automorphisms are obtained. A
considerable step towards the complete answer to the question of whether the
attachment number necessarily divides the radius in tetravalent
half-arc-transitive graphs is made.

D. Olmsted, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 084502 (2004)], we here explore possibilities
to manipulate the dynamical behaviour via closed-loop (feedback) control
involving a time delay $\tau$. The model considered relates the viscoelastic
stress of the system to a structural variable, that is, the length of the
micelles, yielding two time- and space-dependent dynamical variables $\xi_1$,
$\xi_2$. As a starting point we perform a systematic linear stability analysis
of the uncontrolled system for (i) an externally imposed average shear rate and
(ii) an imposed total stress, and compare the results to those from extensive
numerical simulations. We then apply the so-called Pyragas feedback scheme
where the equations of motion are supplemented by a control term of the form
$K\left(a(t)-a(t-\tau)\right)$ with $a$ being a measurable quantity depending
on the rheological protocol. For the choice of an imposed shear rate, the
Pyragas scheme for the total stress reduces to a non-diagonal scheme
concentrating on the viscoelastic stress. Focusing on parameters close to a
Hopf bifurcation, where the uncontrolled system displays oscillatory states as
well as hysteresis in the shear rate controlled protocol, we demonstrate that
(local) Pyragas control leads to a full stabilization to the steady state
solution of the total stress, while a global control scheme does not work. In
contrast, for the case of imposed total stress, global Pyragas control fully
stabilizes the system. In both cases, the control does not change the space of
solutions, rather it selects the steady state solutions out of the existing
solutions. This underlines the non-invasive character of the Pyragas scheme.

highly entangled polymers exhibit shear banding as their steady state response
to a steadily imposed shear flow remains controversial. From a theoretical
viewpoint, an important unanswered question is whether the underlying
constitutive curve of shear stress $\sigma$ as a function of shear rate
$\dot{\gamma}$ (for states of homogeneous shear) is monotonic, or has a region
of negative slope, $d\sigma/d\dot{\gamma}<0$, which would trigger banding.
Attempts to settle the question experimentally via velocimetry of the flow
field inside the fluid are often confounded by an instability of the free
surface where the sample meets the outside air, known as ""edge fracture"". Here
we show by numerical simulation that in fact even only very modest edge
disturbances - which are the precursor of full edge fracture but might well, in
themselves, go unnoticed experimentally - can cause strong secondary flows in
the form of shear bands that invade deep into the fluid bulk. Crucially, this
is true even when the underlying constitutive curve is monotonically
increasing, precluding true bulk shear banding in the absence of edge effects.

However, the radial drift and bouncing barriers are not completely resolved,
especially for silicate dust. Since the collision velocities of dust particles
are regulated by turbulence in a protoplanetary disk, the turbulent clustering
should be properly treated. To that end, direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of
the Navier Stokes equations are requisite. In a series of papers, Pan & Padoan
used a DNS with the Reynolds number Re~1000. Here, we perform DNSs with up to
Re=16100, which allow us to track the motion of particles with Stokes numbers
of 0.01<~St<~0.2 in the inertial range. By the DNSs, we confirm that the rms
relative velocity of particle pairs is smaller by more than a factor of two,
compared to those by Ormel & Cuzzi (2007). The distributions of the radial
relative velocities are highly non-Gaussian. The results are almost consistent
with those by Pan & Padoan or Pan et al. at low-Re. Also, we find that the
sticking rates for equal-sized particles are much higher than those for
different-sized particles. Even in the strong-turbulence case with
alpha-viscosity of 10^{-2}, the sticking rates are as high as >~50% and the
bouncing probabilities are as low as ~10% for equal-sized particles of
St<~0.01. Thus, the turbulent clustering plays a significant role for the
growth of cm-sized compact aggregates (pebbles) and also enhances the solid
abundance, which may lead to the streaming instability in a disk.

topological phases based on a switch-function formalism. When the Floquet
operator has a spectral gap the index covers both clean and disordered phases,
anomalous or not, and does not require the bulk to be fully localized. It is
interpreted as a non-adiabatic charge pumping that is quantized when the sample
is placed next to an effective vacuum. This vacuum is gap-dependent and
obtained from a Floquet Hamiltonian. The choice of a vacuum provides a simple
and alternative gap-selection mechanism. Inspired by the model from Rudner et
al. we then illustrate these concepts on Floquet disordered phases.
Switch-function formalism is usually restricted to infinite samples in the

be to minimize surplus in expectation or in the worst case and these $p$

mechanisms which perform well in expectation becomes analytically challenging
for heterogeneous settings. In this paper, we take a completely different,

redistribution mechanism based on given settings with both the objectives,
optimal in expectation and optimal in the worst case. We also propose a loss

theoretical guarantees for the cases where it has been solved. We observe that
a neural network based redistribution mechanism for homogeneous settings which

longer low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes from shorter ones. The
parity-check matrix of a shorter base code is decomposed into N (N>=2)
non-overlapping components with the same size. Then, these components are
combined together to form the parity-check matrix of a longer code, according
to a given N*N Latin square. To illustrate this method, longer quasi-cyclic
(QC) LDPC codes are obtained with girth at least eight and satisfactory
performance, via shorter QC-LDPC codes with girth eight but poor performance.
The proposed method naturally includes several well-known methods as special
cases, but is much more general compared with these existing approaches.

the widely used methods to estimate the parameters of a linear regression
model. It is well known that these methods perform well under some
distributional assumptions on error terms. However, these distributional
assumptions on the errors may not be appropriate for some data sets. In these
case, nonparametric methods may be considered to carry on the regression
analysis. Empirical likelihood (EL) method is one of these nonparametric
methods. The EL method maximizes a function, which is multiplication of the
unknown probabilities corresponding to each observation, under some constraints
inherited from the normal equations in OLS estimation method. However, it is
well known that the OLS method has poor performance when there are some
outliers in the data. In this paper, we consider the EL method with robustifyed
constraints. The robustification of the constraints is done by using the robust
M estimation methods for regression. We provide a small simulation study and a
real data example to demonstrate the capability of the robust EL method to
handle unusual observations in the data. The simulation and real data results
reveal that robust constraints are needed when heavy tailedness and/or outliers
are possible in the data.

fundamental pseudo-scalar particles (e.g., axions or axion-like particles:
ALPs). Similarly to the Primakoff-effect for axions, ALPs can mix with photons
and consequently be searched for in laboratory experiments and with
astrophysical observations. Here, we search for energy-dependent modulations of
high-energy gamma-ray spectra that are tell-tale signatures of photon-ALPs
mixing. To this end, we analyze the data recorded with the Fermi -LAT from
Galactic pulsars selected to have a line of sight crossing spiral arms at a
large pitch angle. The large-scale Galactic magnetic field traces the shape of
spiral arms, such that a sizable photon-ALP conversion probability is expected
for the sources considered. In nine years of Fermi -LAT data, we detect
significant spectral features in the selected source-sample consistent with
photon-ALPs oscillation with a combined statistical significance of 5.52
{\sigma} . Notably, sources with neighboring lines of sight share similar
spectral features. From a common fit to all sources, we determine the
most-likely parameters for mass $m_{a}$ and coupling $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ to be

the distance of individual sources. We note that an astrophysical

dynamics? There are many diseases, such as norovirus and influenza, where some
infected hosts show symptoms of the disease while others are asymptomatically
infected, i.e. do not show any symptoms. The current paper considers a class of
epidemic models following an SEIR (Susceptible $\to$ Exposed $\to$ Infectious
$\to$ Recovered) structure that allows for both symptomatic and asymptomatic
cases. The following question is addressed: what fraction $\rho$ of those
individuals getting infected are infected by symptomatic (asymptomatic) cases?
This is a more complicated question than the related question for the beginning
of the epidemic: what fraction of the expected number of secondary cases of a
typical newly infected individual, i.e. what fraction of the basic reproduction
number $R_0$, is caused by symptomatic individuals? The latter fraction only
depends on the type-specific reproduction numbers, while the former fraction
$\rho$ also depends on timing and hence on the probabilistic distributions of
latent and infectious periods of the two types (not only their means). Bounds
on $\rho$ are derived for the situation where these distributions (and even
their means) are unknown. Special attention is given to the class of Markov
models and the class of continuous-time Reed-Frost models as two classes of
distribution functions. We show how these two classes of models can exhibit
very different behaviour.

systems we use in our human society adaptively and dynamically change over
time. In the context of artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive systems, the
symbol grounding problem has been regarded as one of the central problems
related to {\it symbols}. However, the symbol grounding problem was originally
posed to connect symbolic AI and sensorimotor information and did not consider
many interdisciplinary phenomena in human communication and dynamic symbol
systems in our society, which semiotics considered. In this paper, we focus on
the symbol emergence problem, addressing not only cognitive dynamics but also
the dynamics of symbol systems in society, rather than the symbol grounding
problem. We first introduce the notion of a symbol in semiotics from the
humanities, to leave the very narrow idea of symbols in symbolic AI.
Furthermore, over the years, it became more and more clear that symbol
emergence has to be regarded as a multifaceted problem. Therefore, secondly, we
review the history of the symbol emergence problem in different fields,
including both biological and artificial systems, showing their mutual
relations. We summarize the discussion and provide an integrative viewpoint and
comprehensive overview of symbol emergence in cognitive systems. Additionally,

possible tool that can be used for this purpose is Docker, a framework that
allows easy, fast deployment of Linux containers. This paper addresses the
suitability of Docker in MEC scenar- ios by quantifying the CPU consumed by
Docker when running two different containerized services: multiplayer gam- ing

servers, yield different results for the two case studies: for the gaming
service, the overhead logged by Docker increases only with the number of
servers; con- versely, for the video streaming case, the overhead is not

diverse systems, from sub-cellular biology to social networks, exhibit
universal topological characteristics. Yet this universality does not naturally
translate to the dynamics of these systems , hindering our progress towards a
general theoretical framework of network dynamics. The source of this
theoretical gap is the fact that the behavior of a complex system cannot be
uniquely predicted from its topology, but rather depends also on the dynamic
mechanisms of interaction between the nodes, hence systems with similar
structure may exhibit profoundly different dynamic behavior. To bridge this
gap, we derive here the patterns of network information transmission, indeed,
the essence of a network's behavior, by offering a systematic translation of
topology into the actual spatio-temporal propagation of perturbative signals.
We predict, for an extremely broad range of nonlinear dynamic models, that the
propagation rules condense around three highly distinctive dynamic universality
classes, characterized by the interplay between network paths, degree
distribution and the interaction dynamics. Our formalism helps us leverage the
major advances in the mapping of real world networks, into predictions on the
actual dynamic propagation, from the spread of viruses in social networks to

  Material and Methods: Under an approved IRB protocol 105 3D-DSA exams were
randomly selected from an internal database. All were acquired using a clinical
system (Axiom Artis zee, Siemens Healthineers) in conjunction with a standard
injection protocol. More than 150 million labeled voxels from 35 subjects were
used for training. A deep convolutional neural network was trained to classify
each image voxel into three tissue types (vasculature, bone and soft tissue).
The trained DLA model was then applied for tissue classification in a
validation cohort of 8 subjects and a final testing cohort consisting of the
remaining 62 subjects. The final vasculature tissue class was used to generate
the 3D-DLA images. To quantify the generalization error of the trained model,
accuracy, sensitivity, precision and F1-scores were calculated for vasculature
classification in relevant anatomy. The 3D-DLA and clinical 3D-DSA images were
subject to a qualitative assessment for the presence of inter-sweep motion
artifacts.
  Results: Vasculature classification accuracy and 95% CI in the testing
dataset was 98.7% ([98.3, 99.1] %). No residual signal from osseous structures
was observed for all 3D-DLA testing cases except for small regions in the otic
capsule and nasal cavity compared to 37% (23/62) of the 3D-DSAs.
  Conclusion: DLA accurately recreated the vascular anatomy of the 3D-DSA
reconstructions without mask. DLA reduced mis-registration artifacts induced by
inter-sweep motion. DLA reduces radiation exposure required to obtain
clinically useful 3D-DSA

literature. Other frequent uses of the same words, Big Bang, as to name the
initial singularity of the cosmos, and also whole cosmological models, are then
addressed, as evolutions of its original meaning. Quantum and inflationary
additions to the celebrated singularity theorems by Penrose, Geroch, Hawking
and others led to subsequent results by Borde, Guth and Vilenkin. And
corresponding corrections to the Einstein field equations have originated, in
particular, $R^2$, $f(R)$, and scalar-tensor gravities, giving rise to a
plethora of new singularities. For completeness, an updated table with a

to describe the geometry of QDs between Tc and Si and how the distance between
QD and Si, and the QD bandgap affects the FRET efficiency. By extending the
acceptor dipole in the FRET model to a 2D plane, and to the bulk, we see a
relaxation of the distance dependence of transfer. Our results indicate that
FRET efficiencies from PbS QDs to Si well above 50 % are be possible at very

method for material science simulations. However, the time scales and system
sizes accessible to QMD are typically limited to picoseconds and a few hundred
atoms. These constraints arise due to expensive self-consistent ground-state
electronic structure calculations that can often scale cubically with the
number of atoms. Linearly scaling methods depend on computing the density
matrix P from the Hamiltonian matrix H by exploiting the sparsity in both
matrices. The second-order spectral projection (SP2) algorithm is an O(N)
algorithm that computes P with a sequence of 40-50 matrix-matrix
multiplications. In this paper, we present task-based implementations of a
recently developed data-parallel graph-based approach to the SP2 algorithm,
G-SP2. We represent the density matrix P as an undirected graph and use graph
partitioning techniques to divide the computation into smaller independent
tasks. The partitions thus obtained are generally not of equal size and give
rise to undesirable load imbalances in standard MPI-based implementations. This
load-balancing challenge can be mitigated by dynamically scheduling parallel
computations at runtime using task-based programming models. We develop
task-based implementations of the data-parallel G-SP2 algorithm using both
Intel's Concurrent Collections (CnC) as well as the Charm++ programming model
and evaluate these implementations for future use. Scaling and performance
results of our implementations are investigated for representative segments of
QMD simulations for solvated protein systems containing more than 10,000 atoms.

the Darboux-Crum net of rational SL equations (SLEs) solved under the cited
DBCs in terms of multi-indexed orthogonal exceptional Romanovski-Jacobi

There are three distinct types of such solutions with no zeros inside the
selected interval: two infinite sequences formed by the PFSs near the lower

that use of classical Jacobi polynomials as seed functions results in the
double-indexed manifold composed of orthogonal X_m-Jacobi polynomials in the

cross-orthogonality relation when integrated from +1 to inf. As a corollary we
assert that each X_m-Jacobi polynomial of degree m + n has exactly m

theory for the low-Reynolds-number motion of a solid particle moving inside a

cavity, we use the stream function technique to find exact analytical solutions

is solely determined by membrane shear properties and that bending does not
play a role. For an arbitrary position of the solid particle within the

axisymmetric flow field induced by a point force (Stokeslet). We then obtain
analytical expressions of the leading order mobility function describing the
fluid-mediated hydrodynamic interactions between the particle and confining

the particle self-mobility function is higher than that predicted inside a
rigid no-slip cavity. Considering the cavity motion, we find that the
pair-mobility function is determined only by membrane shear properties. Our
analytical predictions are supplemented and validated by fully-resolved
boundary integral simulations where a very good agreement is obtained over the

intensive care units. In the United States (U.S.), such infants frequently are
transferred between hospitals. Although these neonatal transfer networks are
important, both economically and for infant morbidity and mortality, the
national-level pattern of neonatal transfers is largely unknown. Using data
from Vermont Oxford Network on 44,753 births, 2,122 hospitals, and 9,722
inter-hospital infant transfers from 2015, we performed the largest analysis to
date on the inter-hospital transfer network for VLBW infants in the U.S. We
find that transfers are organized around regional communities, but that despite
being largely within state boundaries, most communities often contain at least
two hospitals in different states. To classify the structural variation in
transfer pattern amongst these communities, we applied a spectral measure for
regionalization and found an association between a community's degree of
regionalization and their infant transfer rate, which was not utilized in
detecting communities. We also demonstrate that the established measures of
network centrality and hierarchy, e.g., the community-wide entropy in PageRank
or betweenness centrality and number of distinct `layers' within a community,
correlate weakly with our regionalization index and were not significantly
associated with metrics on infant transfer rate. Our results suggest that the
regionalization index captures novel information about the structural
properties of VLBW infant transfer networks, have the practical implication of
characterizing neonatal care in the U.S., and may apply more broadly to the
role of centralizing forces in organizing complex adaptive systems.
