multiple unqualified workers. We introduce a \textit{simple} and \textit{budget
efficient} crowdsourcing method named Proxy Crowdsourcing (PCS). PCS collects
answers from two sets of workers: \textit{leaders} (a.k.a proxies) and
\textit{followers}. Each leader completely answers the survey while each
follower answers only a small subset of it. We then weigh every leader
according to the number of followers to which his answer are closest, and
aggregate the answers of the leaders using any standard aggregation method
(e.g., Plurality for categorical labels or Mean for continuous labels). We
compare empirically the performance of PCS to unweighted aggregation, keeping
the total number of questions (the budget) fixed. We show that PCS improves the
accuracy of aggregated answers across several datasets, both with categorical
and continuous labels. Overall, our suggested method improves accuracy while
being simple and easy to implement.

bandwidth allocation in MPLS DS-TE networks (LSP setup). In general, BAMs
defines resource restrictions by class and allocate the available resources on
demand. This is frequently necessary to manage large and complex systems like
routing networks. GBAM is a new generalized BAM that, by configuration,
incorporates the behavior of existing BAMs (MAM, RDM, G-RDM and
AllocTC-Sharing). In effect, any current available BAM behavior is reproduced
by G-BAM by simply adjusting its configuration parameters. This paper focuses
on investigating the applicability of using autonomy together with Bandwidth
Allocation Models (BAMs) for improve performance and facilitating the
management of MPLS DS-TE networks. It is investigated the applicability of BAM
switching using a framework with autonomic characteristics. In brief, it is
investigated the switching among BAM behaviors and BAM reconfiguration with
distinct network traffic scenarios by using GBAM. Simulation results suggest
that the autonomic switching of BAM behaviors based on high-level management

observed following gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The physical origin of X-ray flares
is still unknown merely with the temporal/spectral information. On the other
hand, some polarimeters are expected to be launched within several years thanks
to the increasing interest on astronomical X-ray polarimetry. Here, by assuming
that X-ray flares are synchrotron radiation from relativistic spherical shells,
we show that the linear polarization degree during the rising phase of an X-ray
flare is much higher for the emitting region with toroidal magnetic fields than
that with random magnetic fields. In the decay phase of the flare, the
evolution of the polarization degree is determined by the curvature effect of
the emitting shell, which is a natural feature of jet scenarios for flares.
Therefore, the measurement of the polarization of X-ray flares would provide a
useful tool to probe the configuration of magnetic fields in the emission
region, and may even help to test the curvature effect. The information on the
magnetic configuration can further help us to understand the properties of GRB
jets.

wavelength scale spheres based on both adjoint optimization or sensitivity
analysis and generalized multi-sphere Mie theory as a solution to the design

with scatterers on sub-wavelength and super-wavelength periodicity grids. Both
sets consist of a singlet and a doublet lens, with one and two layers of
spheres respectively designed for 1550 nm. The designed NA is ~0.33 (~0.5) for
the sub-wavelength (super-wavelength) periodic structure. We find that with the
sub-wavelength periodicity, the full width at half maximum of the focal spot
produced by the singlet and doublet is smaller than that produced by an ideal
lens with the same geometric parameters. Finally, we simulate a realistic
experimental scenario for the doublet where the spheres are placed on a
substrate with the same refractive index. We find the performance is similar,
but with lower intensity at the focal spot and larger spot size. The method
described here will simplify the design procedure for complicated

used to learn a probabilistic classifier differs from the testing distribution

correct the distribution shift by reweighting the training data with the ratio
of the density between test and training data. In many applications training
takes place without prior knowledge of the testing distribution on which the

to address the shift by learning causal structure, but those methods rely on
the diversity of multiple training data to a good performance, and have
complexity limitations in high dimensions. In this paper, we propose a novel
Deep Global Balancing Regression (DGBR) algorithm to jointly optimize a deep
auto-encoder model for feature selection and a global balancing model for
stable prediction across unknown environments. The global balancing model
constructs balancing weights that facilitate estimating of partial effects of
features (holding fixed all other features), a problem that is challenging in
high dimensions, and thus helps to identify stable, causal relationships
between features and outcomes. The deep auto-encoder model is designed to
reduce the dimensionality of the feature space, thus making global balancing
easier. We show, both theoretically and with empirical experiments, that our
algorithm can make stable predictions across unknown environments. Our
experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets demonstrate that our DGBR

budgeting, and participatory legislation. For each setting, we compare each
solution concept to known voting rules and study various properties of the
resulting voting rules. Our framework provides expressive aggregation for a
broad range of social choice settings while remaining simple for voters, and
may enable a unified and integrated implementation for all these settings, as
well as unified extensions such as sybil-resiliency, proxy voting, and
deliberative decision making.

balance, in which a counterweight hangs on to one of its extremities, and two

The result of the analysis revealed that the method proposed by Galileo for the

channel gain is decoded without interference. In order to determine optimal
resource allocation strategies, we formulate optimization problems considering
two models, namely half-duplex and asynchronous transmission, based on how
downlink and uplink operations are coordinated. In both cases, we have
concave-linear fractional problems, and hence Dinkelbach's method can be
applied to obtain the globally optimal solutions. Thus, we first derive
analytical expressions for the harvesting interval, and then we provide an
algorithm to describe the complete procedure. Furthermore, we incorporate
delay-limited sources and investigate the impact of statistical queuing
constraints on the energy-efficient allocation of operating intervals. We
formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the system effective-EE while
UEs are applying NOMA scheme for uplink information transfer. Since the problem
satisfies pseudo-concavity, we provide an iterative algorithm using bisection

that broadcasting at higher power level is more energy efficient for WPCN with

impact on the optimal solution, and in the presence of strict constraints, more
time is allocated for downlink interval under half-duplex operation with uplink

  We use our ideas to make progress on several related questions. We give
satisfiability algorithms beating brute force search for depth-$d$ threshold

algorithms for depth greater than 2. We also show that Parity on $n$ bits
cannot be computed by polynomial-size $\textsf{AC}^0$ circuits with $n^{o(1)}$

could handle more than $\log(n)$ gates. This result also implies
subexponential-time learning algorithms for $\textsf{AC}^0$ with $n^{o(1)}$
threshold gates under the uniform distribution. In addition, we give almost
optimal bounds for the number of gates in a depth-$d$ threshold circuit
computing Parity on average, and show average-case lower bounds for threshold
formulas of any depth.

the structural theory of linear threshold functions, and bounded-read Chernoff

However, to harness the power of microbial communities we must understand not
only how they affect us, but also how they can be influenced to improve
outcomes. This area has been dominated by methods that reduce community
composition to summary metrics, which can fail to fully exploit the complexity
of community data. Recently, methods have been developed to model the abundance
of taxa in a community, but they can be computationally intensive and do not
account for spatial effects underlying microbial settlement. These spatial
effects are particularly relevant in the microbiome setting because we expect
communities that are close together to be more similar than those that are far
apart. In this paper, we propose a flexible Bayesian spike-and-slab variable
selection model for presence-absence indicators that accounts for spatial
dependence and cross-dependence between taxa while reducing dimensionality in
both directions. We show by simulation that in the presence of spatial

for a given prefix code. This is done in two different settings: when the code
is defined by an arbitrary decoder recognizing its star and when the code is
defined by its literal decoder (whose size is polynomially equivalent to the
total length of all words in the code). For the first case for every
$\varepsilon > 0$ we prove $n^{1 - \varepsilon}$-inapproximability for
recognizable binary maximal prefix codes, $\Theta(\log n)$-inapproximability
for finite binary maximal prefix codes and $n^{\frac{1}{2} -
\varepsilon}$-inapproximability for finite binary prefix codes. By
$c$-inapproximability here we mean the non-existence of a $c$-approximation
polynomial time algorithm under the assumption P $\ne$ NP, and by $n$ the
number of states of the decoder in the input. For the second case, we propose
approximation and exact algorithms and conjecture that for finite maximal
prefix codes the problem can be solved in polynomial time. We also study the
related problems of finding a shortest mortal and a shortest avoiding word.

In this paper, we consider variable selection from a new perspective motivated
by the frequently occurred phenomenon that relevant variables are not
completely distinguishable from noise variables on the solution path. We
propose to characterize the positions of the first noise variable and the last
relevant variable on the path. We then develop a new variable selection
procedure to control over-selection of the noise variables ranking after the
last relevant variable, and, at the same time, retain a high proportion of
relevant variables ranking before the first noise variable. Our procedure
utilizes the recently developed covariance test statistic and Q statistic in

evolution and eruption of a twisted coronal flux rope under a coronal streamer
built up by an imposed flux emergence at the lower boundary. The MHD model
incorporates a simple empirical coronal heating, optically thin radiative
cooling, and field aligned thermal conduction, and thus allows the formation of
prominence condensations. We find that during the quasi-static evolution,
prominence/filament condensations of an elongated, sigmoid morphology form in
the dips of the significantly twisted field lines of the emerged flux rope due
to run-away radiative cooling. A prominence cavity also forms surrounding the
prominence, which is best observed above the limb with the line-of-sight nearly
along the length of the flux rope, as shown by synthetic SDO/AIA EUV images.
The magnetic field supporting the prominence is significantly non-force-free
despite the low plasma-beta. By comparing with a simulation that suppresses
prominence formation, we find that the prominence weight is dynamically
important and can suppress the onset of the kink instability and hold the flux
rope in equilibrium for a significantly long time, until draining of the
prominence plasma develops and lightens the prominence weight. The flux rope
eventually develops the kink instability and erupts, producing a prominence
eruption. The synthetic AIA 304 angstrom images show that the prominence is
lifted up into an erupting loop, exhibiting helical features along the loop and
substantial draining along the loop legs, as often seen in observations.

attractive solution, but stringent CPRI requirements such as delay and jitter

investigates whether CoE can meet delay and jitter requirements by performing
FPGA-based Verilog experiments and simulations. Verilog experiments show that
CoE encapsulation with fixed Ethernet frame size requires about tens of
microseconds. Numerical experiments show that the proposed scheduling policy of
CoE flows on Ethernet can reduce jitter when redundant Ethernet capacity is
provided. The reduction in jitter can be as large as 1 {\mu}s, hence making
Ethernet-based mobile fronthaul a credible technology.

compact Abelian Hausdorff (LCA) groups $G$. It is a Banach space that exhibits
a kernel theorem similar to the well-known Schwartz kernel theorem.
Specifically, we call this characterization of the continuous linear operators

functions in $\mathbf{S}'_{0}(G_{1} \times G_{2})$ the ""outer kernel theorem"".
The main subject of this paper is to formulate what we call the ""inner kernel
theorem"". This is the characterization of those linear operators that have
kernels in $\mathbf{S}_{0}(G_{1} \times G_{2})$. Such operators are
regularizing -- in the sense that they map $\mathbf{S}'_{0}(G_{1})$ into
$\mathbf{S}_{0}(G_{2})$ in a $w^{*}$ to norm continuous manner. A detailed
functional analytic treatment of these operators is given and applied to the
case of general LCA groups. This is done without the use of Wilson bases, which
have previously been employed for the case of elementary LCA groups. We apply
our approach to describe natural laws of composition for operators that imitate
those of linear mappings via matrix multiplications. Furthermore, we detail how
these operators approximate general operators (in a weak form). As a concrete
example, we derive the widespread statement of engineers and physicists that
pure frequencies ""integrate"" to a Dirac delta distribution in a mathematically

instantaneous eigenstate of a time-dependent Hamiltonian and the state given by
quantum evolution of duration $\tau$ is upper bounded by $C/\tau$ for some
positive constant $C$. It has been known for decades that this error can be
reduced to $C_{k}/\tau^{k+1}$ if the Hamiltonian has vanishing derivatives up
to order $k$ at the beginning and end of the evolution. Here we extend this
result to open systems described by a time-dependent Liouvillian superoperator.
We find that the same results holds provided the Liouvillian has vanishing
derivatives up to order $k$ only at the end of the evolution. This asymmetry is
ascribable to the arrow of time inherent in open system evolution. We further
investigate whether it is possible to satisfy the required assumptions by
controlling only the system, as required for realistic implementations.
Surprisingly, we find the answer to be affirmative. We establish this
rigorously in the setting of the Davies-Lindblad adiabatic master equation, and
numerically in the setting of two different time-dependent Redfield-type master
equations we derive. The results are shown to be stable with respect to
imperfections in the preparation. Finally, we prove that the results hold also
in a fully Hamiltonian model.

submodular functions to determine a solution to the non-submodular functions.
Hereafter, we propose to address the original problem by \emph{approximating}
the non-submodular function and analyze the incurred error, as well as the
performance trade-offs. To quantify the approximation error, we introduce a
novel concept of $\delta$-approximation of a function, which we used to define
the space of submodular functions that lie within an approximation error. We
provide necessary conditions on the existence of such $\delta$-approximation
functions, which might not be unique. Consequently, we characterize this
subspace which we refer to as \emph{region of submodularity}. Furthermore,
submodular functions are known to lead to different sub-optimality guarantees,
so we generalize those dependencies upon a $\delta$-approximation into the
notion of \emph{greedy curvature}. Finally, we used this latter notion to
simplify some of the existing results and efficiently (i.e., linear complexity)
determine tightened bounds on the sub-optimality guarantees using objective
functions commonly used in practical setups and validate them using real data.

optimal solution of the problem (if it exists) without the usual assumption
that the gradient of the differentiable function involved is globally Lipschitz
continuous. We also obtain the $o(k^{-1})$ complexity for the functional value

to local Lipschitz continuity, improving the existing $\mathcal{O}(k^{-1})$
complexity result. We then derive the local and global Q-linear convergence of
the method in terms of both the function value sequence and the iterative
sequence, under a general metric subregularity assumption which is
automatically satisfied for convex piecewise-linear-quadratic optimization
problems. In particular, we provide verifiable sufficient conditions for metric

proposed method for broad structured optimization problems arise in machine
learning and signal processing including Poisson linear inverse problem, the
partly smooth optimization problems, as well as the $\ell_1$-regularized

astronomers and written by astroparticle physicists. While the focus is on
achievements and goals in neutrino astronomy, rather than on the aspects
connected to particle physics, we will introduce the particle physics concepts
needed to appreciate those aspects that depend on the peculiarity of the
neutrinos. The detailed layout is as follows: In Sect.~1, we introduce the
neutrinos, examine their interactions, and present neutrino detectors and
telescopes. In Sect.~2, we discuss solar neutrinos, that have been detected and
are matter of intense (theoretical and experimental) studies. In Sect.~3, we
focus on supernova neutrinos, that inform us on a very dramatic astrophysical
event and can tell us a lot on the phenomenon of gravitational collapse. In
Sect.~4, we discuss the highest energy neutrinos, a very recent and lively
research field. In Sect.~5, we review the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations
and assess its relevance for neutrino astronomy. Finally, we offer a brief
overall assessment and a summary in Sect.~6. The material is selected - i.e.,
not all achievements are reviewed - and furthermore it is kept to an
introductory level, but efforts are made to highlight current research issues.
In order to help the beginner, we prefer to limit the list of references,
opting whenever possible for review works and books.

heliocentric volume of 10 kpc from our simulations and assigning expected
observational uncertainties corresponding to bright stars from Gaia DR2 and
LAMOST DR5. We compare the results from StarGO against that from a

the satellites within the extracted volume. When applied to data from Gaia DR2,
StarGO will enable us to reveal the origins of the inner stellar halo in

mathematical tools have been developed to analyse stochastic dynamics, rarely
these are applied to experimental developmental biology. Here, we take root tip
regeneration in the plant model system Arabidopsis thaliana as an example of
robust morphogenesis in living tissue and present a novel approach to quantify

generating and analysing time-lapse series of regenerating root tips captured

morphological traits at cellular resolution. We present a linear stability
analysis of its Markovian dynamics, with the stationary state representing the
intact root in the space of morphological traits. We find that the resulting
eigenvalues can be classified into two groups, suggesting the co-existence of
two distinct temporal scales during the process of regeneration. We discuss the
possible biological implications of our specific results and suggest future

perform multi-component decompositions of S0 galaxies to derive accurate

prominent bulges. S0 galaxies have a broad distribution of bulge-to-total
ratios ($B/T$) and S\'ersic indices ($n$), with average values of
$B/T=0.34\pm0.15$ and $n=2.62\pm1.02$, qualitatively consistent with the notion
that S0s define a parallel sequence with and may have evolved from spiral
galaxies. This is further reinforced by the incidence of bars and lenses in
S0s, which when compared with the statistics in spirals, supports the idea that
lenses are demised bars. However, despite their wide range of prominence, the
bulges of S0s form a surprisingly uniform sequence on both the Kormendy and
fundamental plane relations. There is no evidence for population dichotomy or
other indications of differentiation into classical and pseudo bulges. Most of
the S0s reside in the field and in groups; cluster environment is not a
necessary condition for S0 production. The properties of S0 bulges show little
correlation with environmental indicators, after the dependence of galaxy
stellar mass on environment is taken into account. As the bulges of late-type
spirals and S0s are intrinsically different, and environmental effects that may
account for such evolution appear to be minimal, we conclude that late-type
spirals are not plausible progenitors of S0s. The bulges of S0s likely formed
at an early epoch, after which secular processes contributed little to their
subsequent evolution.

However, their precise positioning relative to the nanoantenna is a technical

({\mu}FISH)-based rapid detection of cytogenetic biomarkers on formalin-fixed
paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. We demonstrated this method in the
context of detecting human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) in breast tissue
sections. This method uses a non-contact microfluidic scanning probe (MFP),
which localizes FISH probes at the micrometer length-scale to selected cells of
the tissue section. The scanning ability of the MFP allows for a versatile
implementation of FISH on tissue sections. We demonstrated the use of
oligonucleotide FISH probes in ethylene carbonate-based buffer enabling rapid
hybridization within < 1 min for chromosome enumeration and 10-15 min for
assessment of the HER2 status in FFPE sections. We further demonstrated
recycling of FISH probes for multiple sequential tests using a defined volume
of probes by forming hierarchical hydrodynamic flow confinements. This
microscale method is compatible with the standard FISH protocols and with the
Instant Quality (IQ) FISH assay, reduces the FISH probe consumption ~100-fold
and the hybridization time 4-fold, resulting in an assay turnaround time of < 3
h. We believe rapid {\mu}FISH has the potential of being used in pathology
workflows as a standalone method or in combination with other molecular methods
for diagnostic and prognostic analysis of FFPE sections.

observed line fluxes in each spectrum were directly compared to the grid of
mixed models using the Bayesian parameter estimation code NebulaBayes, thereby
measuring the degree of mixing in each spectrum for the first time. We find
that the majority of the Balmer line emission in the majority of
Seyfert-classified SDSS spectra arises from contaminating HII regions within
the fixed-size aperture. Even for spectra with log [OIII]/Hb $\gtrsim 0.9$, a
median of ~30% of the Balmer flux arises in HII regions. We show that the
results are qualitatively insensitive to the assumed Seyfert ionizing
continuum, and that ionizing spectra with a peak energy of E_peak ~ 40-50 eV
produce the most plausible distributions of mixing fractions. The analysis
cleanly quantifies how the starburst - AGN `mixing fraction' increases on the
BPT diagram for SDSS galaxies. Apart from the mixing fraction, the models also
vary with the ionization parameter in the NLR, the gas pressure, and the

stars in Galactic disk and bulge. Here, we combine Galactic models (for |b|<10
deg) and simulations of LSST observations to study how different observing
strategies affect the number and properties of microlensing events detected by
LSST. We predict that LSST will mostly observe long duration microlensing
events due to the source stars with the averaged magnitude around 22 in r-band,
rather than high-magnification events due to fainter source stars. In Galactic
bulge fields, LSST should detect on the order of 400 microlensing events per
square degree as compared to 15 in disk fields. Improving the cadence increases
the number of detectable microlensing events, e.g., improving the cadence from
6 to 2 days approximately doubles the number of microlensing events throughout
the Galaxy. According to the current LSST strategy, it will observe some fields
900 times during a 10-year survey with the average cadence of ~4-days (I) and
other fields (mostly toward the Galactic disk) around 180 times during a 1-year
survey only with the average 1-day cadence (II). We anticipate that the number
of events corresponding to these strategies are 7900 and 34000, respectively.
Toward similar lines of sight, LSST with the first observing strategy (I) will
detect more and on average longer microlensing events than those observable
with the second strategy. If LSST spends enough time observing near Galactic
plane, then the large number of microlensing events will allow studying
Galactic distribution of planets and finding isolated black holes among wealth
of other science cases.

a variety of efficient algorithms that leverage the rich structure provided by
convexity. Convexity of a smooth set or a function in a Euclidean space is
defined by how it interacts with the standard differential structure in this
space -- the Hessian of a convex function has to be positive semi-definite
everywhere. However, in recent years, there is a growing demand to understand
non-convexity and develop computational methods to optimize non-convex
functions. Intriguingly, there is a type of non-convexity that disappears once
one introduces a suitable differentiable structure and redefines convexity with
respect to the straight lines, or {\em geodesics}, with respect to this
structure. Such convexity is referred to as {\em geodesic convexity}. Interest
in studying it arises due to recent reformulations of some non-convex problems
as geodesically convex optimization problems over geodesically convex sets.
Geodesics on manifolds have been extensively studied in various branches of
Mathematics and Physics. However, unlike convex optimization, understanding
geodesics and geodesic convexity from a computational point of view largely
remains a mystery. The goal of this exposition is to introduce the first part
of geodesic convex optimization -- geodesic convexity -- in a self-contained
manner. We first present a variety of notions from differential and Riemannian
geometry such as differentiation on manifolds, geodesics, and then introduce
geodesic convexity. We conclude by showing that certain non-convex optimization
problems such as computing the Brascamp-Lieb constant and the operator scaling
problem have geodesically convex formulations.

Palatini formalism, is discussed by only postulating the universe homogeneity
and isotropy. To figure this out we build model-independent approximations of
the luminosity distance through rational expansions. These approximants extend
the Taylor convergence radii computed for usual cosmographic series. We thus
consider both Pad\'e and the rational Chebyshev polynomials. They can be used
to accurately describe the universe late-time expansion history, providing
further information on the thermal properties of all effective cosmic fluids
entering the energy momentum tensor of Palatini's gravity. To perform our
numerical analysis, we relate the Palatini's Ricci scalar with the Hubble
parameter $H$ and thus we write down a single differential equation in terms of
the redshift $z$. Therefore, to bound $f(R)$, we make use of the most recent
outcomes over the cosmographic parameters obtained from combined data surveys.
In particular our clue is to select two scenarios, i.e. $(2,2)$ Pad\'e and
$(2,1)$ Chebyshev approximations, since they well approximate the luminosity
distance at the lowest possible order. We find that best analytical matches to
the numerical solutions lead to $f(R)=a+bR^n$ with free parameters given by the
set $(a, b, n)=(-1.627, 0.866, 1.074)$ for $(2,2)$ Pad\'e approximation,
whereas $f(R)=\alpha+\beta R^m$ with $(\alpha, \beta, m)=(-1.332, 0.749,
1.124)$ for $(2,1)$ rational Chebyshev approximation. Finally, our results are

atrial fibrillation (AF). A successful isolation produces a continuous lesion
(scar) completely encircling the veins that stops activation waves from
propagating to the atrial body. Unfortunately, the encircling lesion is often
incomplete, becoming a combination of scar and gaps of healthy tissue. These
gaps are potential causes of AF recurrence, which requires a redo of the
isolation procedure. Late-gadolinium enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance
(LGE-CMR) is a non-invasive method that may also be used to detect gaps, but it
is currently a time-consuming process, prone to high inter-observer
variability. In this paper, we present a method to semi-automatically identify
and quantify ablation gaps. Gap quantification is performed through minimum
path search in a graph where every node is a scar patch and the edges are the
geodesic distances between patches. We propose the Relative Gap Measure (RGM)
to estimate the percentage of gap around a vein, which is defined as the ratio
of the overall gap length and the total length of the path that encircles the
vein. Additionally, an advanced version of the RGM has been developed to
integrate gap quantification estimates from different scar segmentation
techniques into a single figure-of-merit. Population-based statistical and
regional analysis of gap distribution was performed using a standardised
parcellation of the left atrium. We have evaluated our method on synthetic and
clinical data from 50 AF patients who underwent PVI with radiofrequency
ablation. The population-based analysis concluded that the left superior PV is
more prone to lesion gaps while the left inferior PV tends to have less gaps
(p<0.05 in both cases), in the processed data. This type of information can be
very useful for the optimization and objective assessment of PVI interventions.

The high-dimensionality of the observations in this type of applications leads
to prohibitive needs of training data for model-free methods, such as the deep
Q-network (DQN), and its recurrent variant DRQN. Thus, recent works focused on
learning low-dimensional representations that may reduce the need for data.
This paper presents a new and efficient method for learning such
representations. Salient segments of consecutive frames are detected from their
optical flow, and clustered based on their feature descriptors. The clusters
typically correspond to different discovered categories of objects. Segments
detected in new frames are then classified based on their nearest clusters.
Because only a few categories are relevant to a given task, the importance of a
category is defined as the correlation between its occurrence and the agent's
performance. The result is encoded as a vector indicating objects that are in
the frame and their locations, and used as a side input to DRQN. Experiments on
the game Doom provide a good evidence for the benefit of this approach.

It is shown that skyrmions can be written though a number of scenarios that
depend on the experimental technique and parameters of the system. In one
scenario, that branches into subscenarios of different topology, the magnetic
dipole on approaching the film creates a skyrmion-antiskyrmion pair. As the
dipole moves closer to the film it induces collapse of the antiskyrmion and
creation of a non-zero topological charge due to the remaining skyrmion. In a
different scenario the dipole moving parallel to the film nucleates a skyrmion

its own; Rather, this is done through translation of DNA into protein and
subsequent formation of a certain 3D structure. The biological function of a
protein is tightly connected to its specific 3D structure. Prediction of the
protein secondary structure is a crucial intermediate step towards elucidating
its 3D structure and function. Traditional experimental methods for prediction
of protein structure are expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, various
machine learning approaches have been proposed to predict the protein secondary
structure. Nevertheless, the average accuracy of the suggested solutions has
hardly reached beyond 80%. The possible underlying reasons are the ambiguous
sequence-structure relation, noise in input protein data, class imbalance, and
the high dimensionality of the encoding schemes that represent the protein
sequence. In this paper, we propose an accurate multi-component prediction
machine to overcome the challenges of protein structure prediction. We devise a
multi-component designation to address the high complexity challenge in
sequence-structure relation. Furthermore, we utilize a compound string
dissimilarity measure to directly interpret protein sequence content and avoid
information loss. In order to improve the accuracy, we employ two different
classifiers including support vector machine and fuzzy nearest neighbor and
collectively aggregate the classification outcomes to infer the final protein
secondary structures. We conduct comprehensive experiments to compare our model
with the current state-of-the-art approaches. The experimental results
demonstrate that given a set of input sequences, our multi-component framework
can accurately predict the protein structure. Nevertheless, the effectiveness

renormalized Bochner-Laplacian on high tensor powers of a positive line bundle
on a symplectic manifold of bounded geometry. First, we establish the
off-diagonal exponential estimate for the generalized Bergman kernel. As an
application, we obtain the relation between the generalized Bergman kernel on a
Galois covering of a compact symplectic manifold and the generalized Bergman
kernel on the base. Then we state the full off-diagonal asymptotic expansion of
the generalized Bergman kernel, improving the remainder estimate known in the
compact case to an exponential decay. Finally, we establish the theory of
Berezin-Toeplitz quantization on symplectic orbifolds associated with the
renormalized Bochner-Laplacian.

as optical experiments have focused on spin-valley coupling in the valence

monolayer molybdenum disulphide (MoS$_{2}$) samples, displaying highly resolved
Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations at magnetic fields as low as $2~T$. We find the
effective mass $0.7~m_{e}$, about twice as large as theoretically predicted and
almost independent of magnetic field and carrier density. We further detect the
occupation of the second spin-orbit split band at an energy of about $15~meV$,
i.e. about a factor $5$ larger than predicted. In addition, we demonstrate an
intricate Landau level spectrum arising from a complex interplay between a
density-dependent Zeeman splitting and spin and valley-split Landau levels.
These observations, enabled by the high electronic quality of our samples,
testify to the importance of interaction effects in the conduction band of
monolayer MoS$_{2}$.
