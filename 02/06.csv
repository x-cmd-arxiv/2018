superconducting dome in the phase diagram as a function of carrier
concentration. For the simplest iron-based superconductor FeSe (with transition
temperature Tc ~ 8 K), its Tc can be greatly enhanced by doping electrons via
many routes, even up to 65 K in monolayer FeSe/SiTiO3. However, a clear phase
diagram with carrier concentration for FeSe-derived superconductors is still
lacking. Here, we report the observation of a series of discrete
superconducting phases in FeSe thin flakes by continuously tuning carrier
concentration through the intercalation of Li and Na ions with a solid ionic
gating technique. Such discrete superconducting phases are robust against the
substitution of Se by 20% S, but are vulnerable to the substitution of Fe by 2%
Cu, highlighting the importance of the iron site being intact. A complete
superconducting phase diagram for FeSe-derivatives is given, which is distinct
from other unconventional superconductors.

the greatest predictors of successful conservative management of common
shoulder disorders. However, adherence to these protocols is often poor and
typically worse for unsupervised home exercise programs. Currently, there are
limited tools available for objective measurement of adherence in the home
setting. The goal of this study was to develop and evaluate the potential for
performing home shoulder physiotherapy monitoring using a commercial
smartwatch.
  Approach: Twenty healthy adult subjects with no prior shoulder disorders
performed seven exercises from an evidence-based rotator cuff physiotherapy
protocol, while 6-axis inertial sensor data was collected from the active
extremity. Within an activity recognition chain (ARC) framework, four
supervised learning algorithms were trained and optimized to classify the
exercises: k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), random forest (RF), support vector
machine classifier (SVC), and a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN).
Algorithm performance was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation stratified
first temporally and then by subject.
  Main Results: Categorical classification accuracy was above 94% for all
algorithms on the temporally stratified cross validation, with the best
performance achieved by the CRNN algorithm (99.4%). The subject stratified
cross validation, which evaluated classifier performance on unseen subjects,
yielded lower accuracies scores again with CRNN performing best (88.9%).
  Significance: This proof of concept study demonstrates the technical
feasibility of a smartwatch device and supervised machine learning approach to
more easily monitor and assess the at-home adherence of shoulder physiotherapy
exercise protocols.

  Automated Technical and Economical Impact Assessment",,,,,"cs.CE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There are different MV grid concepts with regard to mode of operation and
protection system layout. The increasing installation of DG raises the question
if the currently used concepts are still optimal for future power systems. We
present a methodology that allows the automated calculation and comparison of
target grids within different concepts. Specifically, we consider radial grids,
closed ring grids and grids with switching stations. A target grid structure is
optimized for each of those grid concepts based on geographical information. To
model a realistic planning process, compliance with technical constraints for
normal operation, contingency behaviour and reliability figures are ensured in
all grid concepts. We present a multiphase approach to solve the optimization
problem based on an iterated local search meta-heuristic. We then economically
compare the grids with regards to CAPEX and OPEX for primary and secondary
equipment, to analyse which concept leads to the most overall cost-efficient
target grids. Since the methodology allows an automated evaluation of a large
number of grids, it can be used to draw general conclusions about the
cost-efficiency of specific concepts. The methodology is applied to 44 real MV
grids spanning about 4800km of lines, for which the results show that a radial
grid structure is overall cost efficient compared to grid topologies with
switching stations or closed rings even in grid areas with a large DG
penetration. The contribution of this paper is threefold: first, a
comprehensive methodology to compile automated target grid plans under
realistic premises is presented. Second, the practical applicability of the
approach is demonstrated with a large scale case study with a high degree of
automation. And third, the results of the case study allow to draw conclusions
about the techno-economical differences of different MV grid concepts.

allowing us to record mass-selective and conformationally selective absorption
spectra of the aromatic, aliphatic, and alkyl CH-stretches in the 3.175-3.636

absorption spectra with standard harmonic calculations and with second-order
vibrational perturbation theory anharmonic calculations that use the SPECTRO
program for treating resonances. Results. We show that anharmonicity plays an
important if not dominant role, affecting not only aromatic, but also aliphatic
and alkyl CH-stretch vibrations. The experimental high-resolution data lead to
the conclusion that the variation in Me- and H-PAHs composition might well
account for the observed variations in the 3 micron emission spectra of
carbon-rich and star-forming regions. Our laboratory studies also suggest that
heavily hydrogenated PAHs form a significant fraction of the carriers of IR
emission in regions in which an anomalously strong 3 micron plateau is
observed.

method and the most updated list of CCH data have been recently provided by Yu,
Ratra and Wang (2018). Using the Gaussian kernel they find $H_0=(67.42\pm
4.75)$ km/s/Mpc. Here we extend their analysis to also include the most
released and complete set of SnIa data, which allows us to reduce the
uncertainty by a factor $\sim 3$ with respect to the result found by only
considering the CCH information. We obtain $H_0=(67.06\pm 1.68)$ km/s/Mpc,
which favors again the lower range of values for $H_0$ and is in tension with
$H_0^{{\rm HST}}$. The tension reaches the $2.71\sigma$ level. We round off the
GPs determination too by taking also into account the error propagation of the
kernel hyperparameters when the CCH with and without $H_0^{{\rm HST}}$ are used
in the analysis. In addition, we present a novel method to reconstruct
functions from data, which consists in a weighted sum of polynomial regressions
(WPR). We apply it from a cosmographic perspective to reconstruct $H(z)$ and
estimate $H_0$ from CCH and SnIa measurements. The result obtained with this
method, $H_0=(68.90\pm 1.96)$ km/s/Mpc, is fully compatible with the GPs ones.
Finally, a more conservative GPs+WPR value is also provided, $H_0=(68.45\pm
2.00)$ km/s/Mpc, which is still almost $2\sigma$ away from $H_0^{{\rm HST}}$.

dynamics of electron beams in the solar corona and the inner heliosphere;
currently unobtainable through other means. However, the motion of different
regions of an electron beam (front, middle and back) have never been
systematically analysed before. We characterise the type III burst
frequency-time evolution using the enhanced resolution of LOFAR in the
frequency range 30 to 70 MHz and use this to probe electron beam dynamics.
Methods. The rise, peak and decay times with a 0.2 MHz spectral resolution were
defined for a collection of 31 type III bursts. The frequency evolution is used
to ascertain the apparent velocities of the front, middle and back of the type
III sources and the trends are interpreted using theoretical and numerical
treatments. The type III time profile was better approximated by an asymmetric
Gaussian profile, not an exponential as previously used. Rise and decay times
increased with decreasing frequency and showed a strong correlation. Durations
were smaller than previously observed. Drift rates from the rise times were
faster than from the decay times, corresponding to inferred mean electron beam
speeds for the front, middle and back of 0.2, 0.17, 0, 15 c, respectively.
Faster beam speeds correlate with smaller type III durations. We also find type
III frequency bandwidth decreases as frequency decreases. The different speeds
naturally explain the elongation of an electron beam in space as it propagates
through the heliosphere. The rate of expansion is proportional to the mean
speed of the exciter; faster beams expand faster. Beam speeds are attributed to
varying ensembles of electron energies at the front, middle and back of the
beam.

Algorithm"" (AVTA), a robust and efficient algorithm for computing the subset
$\overline S$ of all $K$ vertices of $conv(S)$, the convex hull of $S$. If
$\Gamma_*$ is the minimum of the distances from each vertex to the convex hull
of the remaining vertices, given any $\gamma \leq \gamma_* = \Gamma_*/R$, $R$
the diameter of $S$, $AVTA$ computes $\overline S$ in $O(nK(m+ \gamma^{-2}))$
operations. If $\gamma_*$ is unknown but $K$ is known, AVTA computes $\overline
S$ in $O(nK(m+ \gamma_*^{-2})) \log(\gamma_*^{-1})$ operations. More generally,
given $t \in (0,1)$, AVTA computes a subset $\overline S^t$ of $\overline S$ in
$O(n |\overline S^t|(m+ t^{-2}))$ operations, where the distance between any $p
\in conv(S)$ to $conv(\overline S^t)$ is at most $t R$. Next we consider AVTA
where input is $S_\varepsilon$, an $\varepsilon$ perturbation of $S$. Assuming
a bound on $\varepsilon$ in terms of the minimum of the distances of vertices
of $conv(S)$ to the convex hull of the remaining point of $S$, we derive
analogous complexity bounds for computing $\overline S_\varepsilon$. We also
analyze AVTA under random projections of $S$ or $S_\varepsilon$. Finally, via
AVTA we design new practical algorithms for two popular machine learning
problems: topic modeling and non-negative matrix factorization. For topic
models AVTA leads to significantly better reconstruction of the topic-word
matrix than state of the art approaches~\cite{arora2013practical,
bansal2014provable}. For non-negative matrix AVTA is competitive with existing

blockchain. The code can be written in different languages with the common
purpose of implementing various kinds of transactions onto the hosting

to satisfy conditions typical of traditional contracts. The software code must
satisfy constrains strongly context dependent which are quite different from

is based on the value of information, a criterion that provides the optimal
trade-off between expected costs and the granularity of the search process. The
value of information yields a stochastic routine for choosing actions during

augment this criterion with a state-transition uncertainty factor, which guides
the search process into previously unexplored regions of the policy space.

Furthermore, we give evidence that these codes can be used for more overhead

simpler decoding schemes compared to codes which are two-dimensional. In

treating them, to - in particular - enable selection of acceptable arguments in
an odd-length cycle when Dung semantics could select none, so far the issues
have been observed from a purely argument-graph-theoretic perspective. Per
contra, we consider argument graphs together with a certain lattice like
semantic structure over arguments e.g. ontology. As we show, the
semantic-argumentgraphic hybrid theory allows us to apply abstract
interpretation, a widely known methodology in static program analysis, to
formal argumentation. With this, even where no arguments in a cycle could be
selected sensibly, we could say more about arguments acceptability of an
argument framework that contains it. In a certain sense, we can verify Dung
extensions with respect to a semantic structure in this hybrid theory, to
consolidate our confidence in their suitability. By defining the theory, and by
making comparisons to existing approaches, we ultimately discover that whether
Dung semantics, or an alternative semantics such as cf2, is adequate or

We perform various perturbations to the hypercube graph---a graph that is known

ability to accurately predict, in real time, the probability a vehicle will be
involved in a collision within an intermediate horizon of 10 to 20 seconds. The
rarity of collisions in real-world data poses a significant challenge to
developing this capability because, as we demonstrate empirically,
intermediate-horizon risk prediction depends heavily on high-dimensional driver
behavioral features. As a result, a large amount of data is required to fit an
effective predictive model. In this paper, we assess whether simulated data can
help alleviate this issue. Focusing on highway driving, we present a three-step
approach for generating data and fitting a predictive model capable of
real-time prediction. First, high-risk automotive scenes are generated using
importance sampling on a learned Bayesian network scene model. Second,
collision risk is estimated through Monte Carlo simulation. Third, a neural
network domain adaptation model is trained on real and simulated data to
address discrepancies between the two domains. Experiments indicate that
simulated data can mitigate issues resulting from collision rarity, thereby
improving risk prediction in real-world data.

to z < 7, and deliver spectra that enable a wide range of diagnostic studies of
the physical properties of galaxies over most of cosmic history. ATLAS Probe
science spans four broad categories: (1) Revolutionizing galaxy evolution
studies by tracing the relation between galaxies and dark matter from galaxy
groups to cosmic voids and filaments, from the epoch of reionization through
the peak era of galaxy assembly; (2) Opening a new window into the dark
Universe by weighing the dark matter filaments using 3D weak lensing with
spectroscopic redshifts, and obtaining definitive measurements of dark energy
and modification of General Relativity using galaxy clustering; (3) Probing the
Milky Way's dust-enshrouded regions, reaching the far side of our Galaxy; and
(4) Exploring the formation history of the outer Solar System by characterizing
Kuiper Belt Objects. ATLAS Probe is a 1.5m telescope with a field of view of
0.4 sq deg, and uses Digital Micro-mirror Devices (DMDs) as slit selectors. It
has a spectroscopic resolution of R = 1000 over 1-4 microns, and a
spectroscopic multiplex factor >5,000. ATLAS is designed to fit within the NASA
probe-class space mission cost envelope; it has a single instrument, a
telescope aperture that allows for a lighter launch vehicle, and mature
technology. ATLAS Probe will lead to transformative science over the entire
range of astrophysics: from galaxy evolution to the dark Universe, from Solar
System objects to the dusty regions of the Milky Way.

expression for the quantum Hamiltonian operator for Bianchi I to both leading

exactly match the form proposed by Ashtekar and Wilson-Ewing in the loop
quantum cosmology (LQC) literature. Furthermore, by using the projection map
from the quantum states of the Bianchi I model to the states of the isotropic
model, we constrain the dynamics also in the homogeneous isotropic case, and
obtain, again to both leading and subleading order in $\hbar$, a quantum
constraint which exactly matches the standard `improved dynamics' of Ashtekar,
Pawlowski and Singh. This result in the isotropic case does not require a
restriction to planar loops, but only the minimality assumption. Our results
strengthen confidence in LQC dynamics and its observational predictions as
consequences of more basic fundamental principles. Of the assumptions made in

B$. Evidence for the chiral anomaly was obtained from the longitudinal
magnetoresistance (LMR) in Na$_3$Bi and GdPtBi. However, current jetting
effects (focussing of the current density $\bf J$) have raised general concerns
about LMR experiments. Here we implement a litmus test that allows the
intrinsic LMR in Na$_3$Bi and GdPtBi to be sharply distinguished from pure
current jetting effects (in pure Bi). Current jetting enhances $J$ along the
mid-ridge (spine) of the sample while decreasing it at the edge. We measure the
distortion by comparing the local voltage drop at the spine (expressed as the
resistance $R_{spine}$) with that at the edge ($R_{edge}$). In Bi, $R_{spine}$
sharply increases with $B$ but $R_{edge}$ decreases (jetting effects are
dominant). However, in Na$_3$Bi and GdPtBi, both $R_{spine}$ and $R_{edge}$
decrease (jetting effects are subdominant). A numerical simulation allows the
jetting distortions to be removed entirely. We find that the intrinsic
longitudinal resistivity $\rho_{xx}(B)$ in Na$_3$Bi decreases by a factor of
10.9 between $B$ = 0 and 10 T. A second litmus test is obtained from the
parametric plot of the planar angular magnetoresistance. These results
strenghthen considerably the evidence for the intrinsic nature of the
chiral-anomaly induced LMR. We briefly discuss how the squeeze test may be
extended to test ZrTe$_5$.

make this processing layer completely hidden from the attacker. Blind
pre-processing improves the white box attack accuracy of MNIST from 94.3\% to

blind pre-processing remains one of the strongest ever reported. Another
strength of our defense is that it eliminates the need for adversarial training
as it can significantly increase the MNIST accuracy without adversarial
training as well. Additionally, blind pre-processing can also increase the
inference accuracy in the face of a powerful attack on CIFAR-10 and SVHN data

symmetries that occur in the normal states of the family of charge-transfer
solids (CTS) that exhibit superconductivity (SC), and discuss how this
knowledge gives insight to the mechanism of the unconventional SC in these
systems. We show that a unified theory of the diverse broken symmetry states
necessarily requires explicit incorporation of strong electron-electron
interactions and lattice discreteness, and most importantly, the correct
bandfilling of one-quarter. Uniquely in the quarter-filled band, there is a
very strong tendency to form nearest neighbor spin-singlets, in both one and
two dimensions. The tendency to spin-singlets, a quantum effect, drives a
commensurate charge-order in the correlated quarter-filled band. This
charge-ordered spin-singlet, which we label as a paired-electron crystal (PEC),
is different from and competes with both the antiferromagnetic state and the
Wigner crystal of single electrons. Further, unlike these classical broken
symmetries, the PEC is characterized by a spin gap. The tendency to the PEC in
two dimensions is enhanced by lattice frustration. Following this
characterization of the spatial broken symmetries, we critically reexamine
spin-fluctuation and resonating valence bond theories of frustration-driven SC
within half-filled band Hubbard and Hubbard-Heisenberg Hamiltonians for the
superconducting CTS. We develop a valence-bond theory of SC within which the
superconducting state is reached by the destabilization of the PEC by
additional pressure-induced lattice frustration that makes the spin-singlets
mobile. Our proposed mechanism for SC is the same for CTS in which the
proximate semiconducting state is antiferromagnetic instead of charge-ordered,
with the only difference that SC in the former is generated via a fluctuating
spin-singlet state as opposed to static PEC.

the atomic structure of MoTe2 encapsulated between two graphene sheets to

large concentration of defects. These include similar point defects (or quantum

types of line defects (or quantum wires, QWs) that can be transformed from one
to the other under electron irradiation. Our density functional theory
simulations indicate that the QDs and QWs embedded in MoTe2 introduce new
midgap states into the semiconducting material, and may thus be used to control
its electronic and optical properties. Finally, the edge of the encapsulated

harvesting process is Poisson with unit rate, and arrives in amounts that fully

Updates need to be sent in a timely manner to the destination, namely, such
that the long term average age of information is minimized over the course of
communication. The age of information is defined as the time elapsed since the
freshest update has reached the destination. We first show that the optimal

deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) experiments with two detected final state

(IFF), which makes it possible to extract the transversity parton distribution
of the nucleon in the collinear framework. However, previously unnoticed
discrepancies were recently highlighted between the definitions of the IFFs
appearing in the collinear kinematics when reconstructed from DiFFs entering
the unintegrated fully differential cross sections of SIDIS and $e^+e^-$

fully differential cross section for $e^+e^-$ annihilation at the leading-twist

original expression that systematically affects a subset of terms and that
leads to two significant consequences. First, the discrepancy between the IFF
definitions in the cross sections for SIDIS and $e^+e^-$ annihilation is
resolved. Second, the previously derived azimuthal asymmetry for accessing the
helicity dependent DiFF $G_1^\perp$ in $e^+e^-$ annihilation vanishes, which
explains the nonobservation of this asymmetry in the recent experimental
searches by the ${\tt BELLE}$ Collaboration. We discuss the recently proposed
alternative option to extract $G_1^\perp$.

spherical and ellipsoidal profiles of the form rho(R) ~ R^n to the radial

to the spherical case, for which we obtain a simple power-law index of

fully cosmological context. We show that the ETGs within the
\textit{Magneticum} simulation are in remarkable agreement with the
observations, revealing fast and slow rotators quantified by the angular
momentum proxy $\lambda_{\mathrm{R}}$ and the flattening $\epsilon$ with the
observed prevalence. Taking full advantage of the three-dimensional data, we
demonstrate that the dichotomy between fast and slow rotating galaxies gets
enhanced, showing an upper and lower population separated by an underpopulated
region in the edge-on $\lambda_{\mathrm{R}}$-$\epsilon$ plane. Following the
evolution of the $\lambda_{\mathrm{R}}$-$\epsilon$ plane through cosmic time,
we find that, while the upper population is already in place at $z=2$, the
lower population gets statistically significant below $z=1$ with a gradual
increase. At least $50\%$ of the galaxies transition from fast to slow rotators
on a short timescale, in most cases associated to a significant merger event.
Furthermore, we connect the $M_{*}$-$j_{*}$ plane, quantified by the $b$-value,

lensing information associated to the presence of very close pairs of multiple
images at various redshifts and to the extended surface brightness distribution
of the SN Refsdal host, we can reconstruct the total mass density profile of
the cluster very precisely. The combined dependence of the multiple image
positions and time delays on the cosmological parameters allows us to infer the
values of $H_{0}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ with relative (1$\sigma$) statistical
errors of, respectively, 6% (7%) and 31% (26%) in flat (general) cosmological
models, assuming a conservative 3% uncertainty on the final time delay of image
SX and, remarkably, no priors from other cosmological experiments. Our best
estimate of $H_{0}$, based on the model described in this work, will be
presented when the final time-delay measurement becomes available. Our results
show that it is possible to utilize time delays in lens galaxy clusters as an
important alternative tool for measuring the expansion rate and the geometry of
the Universe.

the Markov property of the CFT vacuum (saturation of strong subadditivity) for
regions bounded on the same lightcone. This gives a holographic proof of the
result proven for general CFTs in arXiv:1703.10656. A similar holographic proof

emitted by different mass haloes and by stars with different metallicities and

low mass, metal poor haloes provide most of the LyC photons, their contribution
decreases steadily with time. At $z = 6$ it is the photons emitted by massive

are large variations in the escape fraction depending on the source, with the
escape fraction being highest ($\sim 45-60\%$) for photons emitted by the
oldest stars that penetrate into the IGM via low opacity channels carved by the
ionising photons and supernova from younger stars. Before HII regions begin to
overlap, the photoionisation rate strongly fluctuates between different,
isolated HII bubbles, depending on the embedded ionising source, which we
suggest may result in spatial variations in the properties of dwarf galaxies.

excess of low-mass rapidly quenched galaxies in cluster environments compared
to the field. Cluster environments also show a corresponding deficit of young,
low-mass star-forming galaxies, which show a sharp radial decline towards
cluster centres. By comparing mass functions and radial distributions, we
conclude that young star-forming galaxies are rapidly quenched as they enter
overdense environments, becoming post-starburst galaxies before joining the red
sequence. Our results also point to the existence of two environmental
quenching pathways operating in galaxy clusters, operating on different
timescales. Fast quenching acts on galaxies with high specific star-formation
rates, operating on timescales shorter than the cluster dynamical time ($ < 1$
Gyr). In contrast, slow quenching affects galaxies with moderate specific
star-formation rates, regardless of their stellar mass, and acts on longer
timescales ($\gtrsim 1$ Gyr). Of the cluster galaxies in the stellar mass range
$9.0 < \log(M_{*}/M_{\odot}) < 10.5$ quenched during this epoch, we find that
73% were transformed through fast quenching, while the remaining 27% followed
the slow quenching route.

of angular momentum outward, as well as the possible origin of different kinds
of magnetic barrier in advective, geometrically thick, sub-Keplerian accretion
flows around black holes. The origin of this large scale strong magnetic field
near the event horizon is due to the advection of the magnetic flux by the
accreting gas from the environment, say, the interstellar medium or a companion
star, because of flux freezing. In this simplest vertically averaged,
1.5-dimensional disc model, we choose the maximum upper limit of the magnetic
field, which the disc around a black hole can sustain. In this so called
magnetically arrested disc (MAD) model, the accreting gas either decelerates or
faces the magnetic barrier near the event horizon by the accumulated magnetic
field depending on the geometry. The magnetic barrier may knock the matter to
infinity. We suggest that these types of flow are the building block to produce
jets and outflows in the accreting system. We also find that in some cases,
when matter is trying to go back to infinity after knocking the barrier, matter
is prevented being escaped by the cumulative action of strong gravity and the
magnetic tension, hence by another barrier. In this way, magnetic field can
lock the matter in between these two barriers and it might be a possible
explanation for the formation of episodic jet.

this scenario, most of the gas in the Stream and Leading Arm is stripped from

Stream also reveal an order of magnitude more gas than in current tidal models.
We present hydrodynamical simulations of the multiple encounters between the

were more extended and gas rich in the past. Our models create filamentary
structures of gas in the Trailing Stream from both the LMC and SMC. While the
SMC trailing filament matches the observed Stream location, the LMC filament is
offset. In addition, the total observed mass of the Stream in these models is
underestimated of a factor of four when the ionized component is accounted for.
Our results suggest that there should also be gas stripped from both the LMC

This prediction is consistent with recent measurements of spatial variation in

chemical potential (so that the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium). The
hairy black holes merge with the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole family at the

than their local counterparts. The slopes of the relation between the stellar
mass and the light-weighted size are consistent with recent studies in clusters
and the field. Their mass-weighted sizes are smaller than the rest frame
$R$-band sizes, with an average mass-weighted to light-weighted size ratio that
varies between $\sim0.45$ and $0.8$ among the clusters. We find that the median
light-weighted size of the passive galaxies in the two more evolved clusters is
$\sim24\%$ larger than for field galaxies, independent of the use of
circularized effective radii or semi-major axes. These two clusters also show a
smaller size ratio than the less evolved cluster, which we investigate using
color gradients to probe the underlying $M_{*}/L_{H_{160}}$ gradients. The
median color gradients are $\nabla{z-H} \sim-0.4$ mag dex$^{-1}$, twice the
local value. Using stellar populations models, these gradients are best
reproduced by a combination of age and metallicity gradients. Our results favor
the minor merger scenario as the dominant process responsible for the observed

introduces a quick and easy algorithm for finding a gamma distribution that

base-stacking, hydrogen bond, and electrostatic interactions as well as
bond-stretching and bond angle potentials that account for the polymeric nature
of DNA. The choices of force constants for stretching and the bending
potentials were guided by a Boltzmann inversion procedure using a large
representative set of DNA structures extracted from the Protein Data Bank. Some
of the parameters in the stacking interactions were calculated using a learning
procedure, which ensured that the experimentally measured melting temperatures
of dimers are faithfully reproduced. Without any further adjustments, the
calculations based on the TIS model reproduces the experimentally measured salt
and sequence dependence of the size of single stranded DNA (ssDNA), as well as
the persistence lengths of poly(dA) and poly(dT) chains. Interestingly, upon
application of mechanical force the extension of poly(dA) exhibits a plateau,
which we trace to the formation of stacked helical domains. In contrast, the
force-extension curve (FEC) of poly(dT) is entropic in origin, and could be
described by a standard polymer model. We also show that the persistence length
of double stranded DNA is consistent with the prediction based on the worm-like
chain. The persistence length, which decreases with increasing salt
concentration, is in accord with the Odijk-Skolnick-Fixman theory intended for
stiff polyelectrolyte chains near the rod limit. The range of applications,
which did not require adjusting any parameter after the initial construction
based solely on PDB structures and melting profiles of dimers, attests to the
transferability and robustness of the TIS model for ssDNA and dsDNA.

is added to the PSSC cost function to calculate the closest admissible set

admissible setpoint by the control action of the PSSC. The performance of the
proposed PSSC is evaluated for an advanced automotive engine case study, where
a high fidelity physics-based model of a reactivity controlled compression

the developed predictive controller is able to track desired engine load and

country. In combination with China's emission control and clean air
initiatives, it has resulted in large-scale expansion of the leading renewable
energy technologies, wind and solar power. Their intermittent nature and uneven
geographic distribution, however, raises the question of how to best exploit
them in a future sustainable electricity system, where their combined
production may very well exceed that of all other technologies. It is well
known that interconnecting distant regions provides more favorable production
patterns from wind and solar. On the other hand, long-distance connections
challenge traditional local energy autonomy. In this paper, the advantage of
interconnecting the contiguous provinces of China is quantified. To this end,
two different methodologies are introduced. The first aims at gradually
increasing heterogeneity, that is non-local wind and solar power production, to
minimize production costs without regard to the match between production and
demand. The second method optimizes the trade-off between low cost production
and high utility value of the energy. In both cases, the study of a 100%
renewable Chinese electricity network is based on 8 years of high-resolution
hourly time series of wind and solar power generation and electricity demand
for each of the provinces. From the study we conclude that compared to a
baseline design of homogeneously distributed renewable capacities, a
heterogeneous network not only lowers capital investments but also reduces
backup dispatches from thermal units. Installing more capacity in provinces
like Inner Mongolia, Jiangsu, Hainan and north-western regions, heterogeneous
layouts may lower the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) by up to 27%, and
reduce backup needs by up to 64%.

(SFEM). Surface FEM approximate solutions to PDE posed on surfaces.
Prototypical examples are elliptic PDE involving the Laplace-Beltrami operator.
Typically the surface is approximated by a polyhedral or higher-order
polynomial approximation. The resulting FEM exhibits both a geometric
consistency error due to the surface approximation and a standard Galerkin
error. A posteriori estimates for SFEM require practical access to geometric
information about the surface in order to computably bound the geometric error.
It is thus advantageous to allow for maximum flexibility in representing
surfaces in practical codes when proving a posteriori error estimates for SFEM.
However, previous a posteriori estimates using general parametric surface
representations are suboptimal by one order on $C^2$ surfaces. Proofs of error
estimates optimally reflecting the geometric error instead employ the closest
point projection, which is defined using the signed distance function. Because
the closest point projection is often unavailable or inconvenient to use
computationally, a posteriori estimates using the signed distance function have
notable practical limitations. We merge these two perspectives by assuming {\it
practical} access only to a general parametric representation of the surface,
but using the distance function as a {\it theoretical} tool. This allows us to
derive sharper geometric estimators which exhibit improved experimentally
observed decay rates when implemented in adaptive surface finite element
algorithms.

addition, we assess the impact of two-way sweeping through the critical region
of a canonical Pitchfork bifurcation with a constant external asymmetry. The
parallel with decision-making in bio-circuits is performed on this simple
system since it is equivalent in its available states and dynamics to more
complex genetic circuits. Overall, we verify that rate-dependent effects are
specific to particular initial conditions. Information processing for each
starting state is affected by the balance between sweeping speed through
critical regions, and the type of fluctuations added. For a heavy-tail noise,
forward-reverse dynamic bifurcations are more efficient in processing the
information contained in external signals, when compared to the system relying
on escape dynamics, if it starts at an attractor not favoured by the asymmetry

of Fargues and Shin we have a description of $\mathrm{Mant}_{b, \mu}(\rho)$ for

Bayesian framework. The Viterbi path is an estimate of the underlying state
path in hidden Markov models (HMMs), which has a maximum posterior probability
(MAP). For an HMM with given parameters, the Viterbi path can be easily found
with the Viterbi algorithm. In the Bayesian framework the Viterbi algorithm is
not applicable and several iterative methods can be used instead. We introduce
a new EM-type algorithm for finding the MAP path and compare it with various
other methods for finding the MAP path, including the variational Bayes
approach and MCMC methods. Examples with simulated data are used to compare the
performance of the methods. The main focus is on non-stochastic iterative
methods and our results show that the best of those methods work as well or
better than the best MCMC methods. Our results demonstrate that when the
primary goal is segmentation, then it is more reasonable to perform
segmentation directly by considering the transition and emission parameters as
nuisance parameters.

expands both the Stokes vector and the phase matrix in a finite series of

we show the results of electrical current induced magnetic hysteresis in
magneto-resistance measurements in these nano-pillar composites. We observe
that when the current level is low, for example, 1 uA, the magneto-resistance

phase diagram and related edge mode structure dictated by choice of inter-chain
and intra-chain couplings. Namely, we exhibit three distinct physical regimes:
a topological hosting localized zero energy edge modes, a topologically trivial
phase having no edge mode structure, and a regime reminiscent of a weak
topological insulator having unprotected edge modes resembling a ""twin-SSH""
construction. In the topological phase, the SSH ladder system acts as an analog
of the Kitaev chain, which is known to support localized Majorana fermion end
modes, with the difference that bound states of the SSH ladder having the same
spatial wavefunction profiles correspond to Dirac fermion modes. Further,
inhomogeneity in the couplings can have a drastic effect on the topological
phase diagram of the ladder system. In particular for quasiperiodic variations
of the inter-chain coupling, the phase diagram reproduces Hofstadter's
butterfly pattern. We thus identify the SSH ladder system as a potential
candidate for experimental observation of such fractal structure.

spectroscopy signal-to-noise in the near-infrared and visible. Unabated,
especially when using highly coherent light sources for wavelength calibration,
modal noise can induce radial velocity (RV) errors that hinder the discovery of
low-mass (and potentially Earth-like) planets. Previous research in this field
has found sufficient modal noise mitigation through the use of an integrating
sphere, but this requires extremely bright light sources, a luxury not
necessarily afforded by the next generation of high-resolution optical
spectrographs. Otherwise, mechanical agitation, which ""mixes"" the fiber's modal
patterns and allows the noise to be averaged over minutes-long exposures,
provides some noise reduction but the exact mechanism behind improvement in
signal-to-noise and RV drift has not been fully explored or optimized by the
community. Therefore, we have filled out the parameter space of modal noise
agitation techniques in order to better understand agitation's contribution to
mitigating modal noise and to discover a better method for agitating fibers. We
find that modal noise is best suppressed by the quasi-chaotic motion of two
high-amplitude agitators oscillating with varying phase for fibers with large
core diameters and low azimuthal symmetry. This work has subsequently
influenced the design of a fiber agitator, to be installed with the EXtreme
PREcision Spectrograph, that we estimate will reduce modal-noise-induced RV
error to less than 3.2 cm/s.

engineering systems ranging from persistently active volcanoes to counterflows
in oceanic straits. Experiments of exchange flows in closed vertical tubes have
been used as surrogates to elucidate the basic features of such flows. The
resulting data have historically been analyzed and interpreted through
core-annular flow solutions, the most common flow configuration at finite
viscosity contrasts. These models have been successful in fitting experimental
data, but less effective at explaining the variability observed in natural
systems. In this paper, we formulate a core-annular solution to the classical
problem of buoyancy-driven exchange flows in vertical tubes. The model posits
the existence of two mathematically valid solutions, i.e. thin- and thick-core
solutions. The theoretical existence of two solutions, however, does not
necessarily imply that the system is bistable in the sense that flow switching
may occur. Using direct numerical simulations, we test the hypothesis that
core-annular flow in vertical tubes is bistable, which implies that the
realized flow field is not uniquely defined by the material parameters of the
flow. Our numerical experiments, which fully predict experimental data without
fitting parameters, demonstrate that buoyancy-driven exchange flows are indeed
inherently bistable systems. This finding is consistent with previous
experimental data, but in contrast to the underlying hypothesis of previous
analytical models that the solution is unique and can be identified by
maximizing the flux or extremizing the dissipation in the system. These results
have important implications for data interpretation by analytical models, and
may also have relevant ramifications for understanding volcanic degassing.

the huge number of quanta that are produced by scattering even a few particles
against a complex quantum object. Prominent examples are found from high energy
cosmic ray showers to the optical or electrical driving of degenerate Fermi
gases. We tackle this challenge in the context of many-body quantum optics, as
motivated by the recent developments of circuit quantum electrodynamics at
ultrastrong coupling. The issue of particle production is addressed
quantitatively with a simple yet powerful concept rooted in the quantum
superposition principle. This key idea is illustrated by the study of
multi-photon emission from a single two-level artificial atom coupled to a high
impedance waveguide. We find surprisingly that the off-resonant inelastic
emission lineshape is dominated by broadband particle production, due to the
large phase space associated with contributions that do not conserve the number
of excitations. Such frequency conversion processes produce striking signatures
in time correlation measurements, which can be tested experimentally in quantum
waveguides. These ideas open new directions for the simulation of a variety of
physical systems, from polaron dynamics in solids to complex superconducting
quantum architectures.

maximize the expected positive impact to the overall task? We formulate a
solution to the adviser problem for viewpoint estimation using a deep network
where the question asks for the location of a keypoint in the input image. We

simulations, photometric passbands are usually subject to refinements. These
refinements use photometric observations of astronomical sources with known
spectral energy distribution. This work investigates the methods for and
limitations in determining passbands from photometric observations. A simple
general formalism for passband determinations from photometric measurements is
derived. The results are applied to the passbands of HIPPARCOS, Tycho, and Gaia
DR1. The problem of passband determination is formulated in a basic functional
analytic framework. For the solution of the resulting equations, functional
principal component analysis is applied. We find that, given a set of
calibration sources, the passband can be described with respect to the set of
calibration sources as the sum of two functions, one which is uniquely
determined by the set of calibration sources, and one which is entirely
unconstrained. The constrained components for the HIPPARCOS, Tycho, and Gaia

ion collisions to study the soft component of jets in a quark gluon plasma.
There is a large correlated background which is described by the Fourier
decomposition of the azimuthal anisotropy where $v_n$ is the $n$th order
coefficient. The path length dependence of partonic energy loss can be studied
by varying the angle of the high momentum trigger particle or jet relative to a
reconstructed event plane. This modifies the shape of the background correlated
with that event plane. The original derivation of the shape of this background
only considered correlations relative to the second order event plane, which is
correlated to the initial participant plane. We derive the shape of this
background for an event plane at an arbitrary order. There is a phase shift in
the case of jets restricted to asymmetric regions relative to the event plane.
For realistic correlations between event planes, the correlation between the
second and fourth order event planes leads to a much smaller effect than the
finite event plane resolution at each order. Finally, we assess the status of
the rapidity even $v_1$ term due to flow, which has been measured to be
comparable to $v_2$ and $v_3$ terms.

calculations when one employs a basis set made of localized orbitals that move

population defined in terms of the localized orbitals across multiple atoms,
then unconventional Pulay terms will emerge due to the variation of the orbital
nonorthogonality with ionic translation. Here, we derive the required exact
expressions for such terms, which cannot be eliminated by orbital
orthonormalization. We have implemented these corrected ionic forces within the
linear-scaling density functional theory (DFT) package ONETEP, and have used
constrained DFT to calculate the reorganization energy of a pentacene molecule
adsorbed on a graphene flake. The calculations are performed by including
ensemble DFT, corrections for periodic boundary conditions, and empirical Van
der Waals interactions. For this system we find that tensorially invariant
population analysis yields an adsorbate subspace population that is very close
to integer-valued when based upon nonorthogonal Wannier functions, and also but
less precisely when using pseudoatomic functions. Thus, orbitals can provide a
very effective population analysis for constrained DFT. Our calculations show
that the reorganization energy of the adsorbed pentacene is typically lower
than that of pentacene in the gas phase. We attribute this effect to steric

manuscript is to provide the empirical estimation of the Gaia $G$-band
extinction coefficient $k_G$ for both the red giants and main sequence stars,
in order to be able to exploit the first data release DR1. We selected two
samples of single stars: one for the red giants and one for the main sequence.
Both samples are the result of a cross-match between Gaia DR1 and 2MASS

$Ks$-bands. These samples were complemented by temperature and metallicity
information retrieved from, respectively, APOGEE DR13 and LAMOST DR2 surveys.
We implemented a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method where we used $(G-Ks)_0$ vs
$T_\mathrm{eff}$ and $(J-Ks)_0$ vs $(G-Ks)_0$ calibration relations to estimate
the extinction coefficient $k_G$ and we quantify its corresponding confidence
interval via bootstrap resampling method. We tested our method on samples of
red giants and main sequence stars, finding consistent solutions. We present
here the determination of the Gaia extinction coefficient through a completely
empirical method. Furthermore we provide the scientific community a formula for
measuring the extinction coefficient as a function of stellar effective
temperature, the intrinsic colour $(G-Ks)_0$ and absorption.

determined by the eigen-states of quantum well which are involved in the

superpositions of eigen-states in some quantum wells, and the correspondence
relations are identical for solitons in both attractive interaction and

the beating effects of solitons for attractive and repulsive interaction cases
in a unified way, based on the knowledge of quantum eigen-states. Moreover, our
results demonstrate many different beating patterns for solitons in

one-dimensional diffusions on $-\infty\leq a<b\leq \infty$ in terms of their
ability to access the boundary (Feller's test for explosions) and to enter the
interior from the boundary. Feller's technique is restricted to diffusion
processes as the corresponding differential generators allow explicit
computations and the use of Hille-Yosida theory. In the present article we
study exit and entrance from infinity for the most natural generalization, that
is, jump diffusions of the form \[
  dZ_t=\sigma(Z_{t-})\,dX_t, \] driven by stable L\'evy processes for
$\alpha\in (0,2)$. Many results have been proved for jump diffusions, employing
a variety of techniques developed after Feller's work but exit and entrance
from infinite boundaries has long remained open. We show that the presence of
jumps implies features not seen in the diffusive setting without drift. Finite
time explosion is possible for $\alpha\in (0,1)$, whereas entrance from
different kinds of infinity is possible for $\alpha\in [1,2)$. We derive
necessary and sufficient conditions on $\sigma$ so that (i) non-exploding
solutions exist and (ii) the corresponding transition semigroup extends to an
entrance point at `infinity'.
  Our proofs are based on very recent developments for path transformations of
stable processes via the Lamperti-Kiu representation and new Wiener-Hopf
factorisations for L\'evy processes that lie therein. The arguments draw
together original and intricate applications of results using the
Riesz-Bogdan--\.Zak transformation, entrance laws for self-similar Markov
processes, perpetual integrals of L\'evy processes and fluctuation theory,
which have not been used before in the SDE setting, thereby allowing us to
employ classical theory such as Hunt-Nagasawa duality and Getoor's
characterisation of transience and recurrence.

problems that come with a wide spectrum of applications, each demanding a
possibly different evaluation criterion. When solving the MLC problems, we
generally expect the learning algorithm to take the hidden correlation of the
labels into account to improve the prediction performance. Extracting the
hidden correlation is generally a challenging task. In this work, we propose a
novel deep learning framework to better extract the hidden correlation with the
help of the memory structure within recurrent neural networks. The memory
stores the temporary guesses on the labels and effectively allows the framework
to rethink about the goodness and correlation of the guesses before making the
final prediction. Furthermore, the rethinking process makes it easy to adapt to
different evaluation criteria to match real-world application needs. In
particular, the framework can be trained in an end-to-end style with respect to
any given MLC evaluation criteria. The end-to-end design can be seamlessly
combined with other deep learning techniques to conquer challenging MLC
problems like image tagging. Experimental results across many real-world data
sets justify that the rethinking framework indeed improves MLC performance
across different evaluation criteria and leads to superior performance over
state-of-the-art MLC algorithms.

synthetic secular frequency spectra to analyze how analogues of Kepler-11 and
Kepler-90 behave in the presence of a nearly co-planar, Jupiter-like outer
perturber with semi-major axes between 1 and 5.2 au. Most locations of the
outer perturber do not affect the evolution of the inner planetary systems,
apart from altering precession frequencies. However, there are locations at
which an outer planet causes system instability due to, in part, secular
eccentricity resonances. In Kepler-90, there is a range of orbital distances
for which the outer perturber drives planets b and c, through secular
interactions, onto orbits with inclinations that are $\sim16^\circ$ away from
the rest of the planets. Kepler-90 is stable in this configuration. Such
secular resonances can thus affect the observed multiplicity of transiting
systems. We also compare the synthetic apsidal and nodal precession frequencies
with the secular theory and find some misalignment between principal
frequencies, indicative of strong interactions between the planets (consistent
with the system showing TTVs). First-order libration angles are calculated to
identify MMRs in the systems, for which two near-MMRs are shown in Kepler-90,

the location of the radio source. This places M10-VLA1 within the scatter of
the radio--X-ray luminosity correlation for quiescent stellar-mass black holes,
and a black hole X-ray binary is a viable explanation for this system. The
radio and X-ray properties of the source disfavor, though do not rule out,
identification as an accreting neutron star or white dwarf system. Optical
imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope and spectroscopy from the SOAR

the shortest estimated merger timescale, 46 Myr; at that time it will display

learning aims at jointly learning a dictionary and corresponding sparse

important countermeasures for traffic congestion. Although capacity expansion
had been traditionally well noticed as a congestion mitigation measure, but it
was not until recently that capacity reduction measures such as; congestion
pricing, road diet and other such capacity reduction measures were noticed as
congestion mitigation measures. Measures such as signal optimization, metering
and congestion pricing are intended to affect the travel pattern and assignment
behavior of travelers to make the results of the User Equilibrium (UE) traffic
assignment, followed by the travelers, closer to the System Optimal (SO)
outcomes, intended by the planners. As such, a bi-level optimization model was
formulated for the simultaneous optimization of capacity improvement/expansion
and signal timing in an urban transportation network. The model takes into
account both the effect of higher demand, induced by the capacity expansion,
and the rerouting potential effect of traffic signals. The solution algorithm
developed here consists of two major components; the gradient projection
algorithm (GP) to solve the lower level traffic assignment problem and the
Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm to solve the master problem. In order to
illustrate the method a case study was examined. The analysis and application
of the proposed algorithm shows that the performance function gradually
converged along the simulation run, and no divergence problem is observed. By
applying the developed algorithm, the total network travel time reduced by
13.42%, in which 5.76% is reached by only optimizing the signal times. Using
the GP algorithm and taking advantages of dynamic memory in the process of

challenging task in 5G Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) given the stringent
latency and high capacity requirements of 5G networks. This is particularly
factual knowing that the infrastructure tends to be highly diversified
especially with the continuous deployment of small cells. In fact, frequent
handovers in these cells introduce unnecessarily recurring authentications
leading to increased latency. In this paper, we propose a software-defined
wireless network (SDWN)-enabled fast cross-authentication scheme which combines
non-cryptographic and cryptographic algorithms to address the challenges of
latency and weak security. Initially, the received radio signal strength
vectors at the mobile terminal (MT) is used as a fingerprinting source to
generate an unpredictable secret key. Subsequently, a cryptographic mechanism
based upon the authentication and key agreement protocol by employing the
generated secret key is performed in order to improve the confidentiality and
integrity of the authentication handover. Further, we propose a radio trusted
zone database aiming to enhance the frequent authentication of radio devices
which are present in the network. In order to reduce recurring authentications,
a given covered area is divided into trusted zones where each zone contains
more than one small cell, thus permitting the MT to initiate a single
authentication request per zone, even if it keeps roaming between different
cells. The proposed scheme is analyzed under different attack scenarios and its
complexity is compared with cryptographic and non-cryptographic approaches to
demonstrate its security resilience and computational efficiency.

representative of a virtual knot is an embedding $ S^1 \hookrightarrow

  This definition of sliceness exemplifies that a cobordism of virtual links is
a pair consisting of a surface and a $ 3 $-manifold; in addition to analysing
the surfaces, as is done in classical knot theory, we may analyse the $ 3
$-manifolds appearing in cobordisms between virtual knots. In particular,
consider a Morse function on the $ 3 $-manifold $ M $: away from critical
points the level sets are surfaces, and we may ask how the genus of these
surfaces changes as we move through the cobordism. Roughly, a slice virtual
knot $ K $ with genus-minimal representative $ S^1 \hookrightarrow \Sigma_{g}
\times I $ is ascent slice if, given any disc and $ 3 $-manifold pair $ ( D, M
) $ as above, and any Morse function $ f : M \rightarrow I $, the surface $
\Sigma_{g+1} $ appears as a level set of $ f $.
  We use an augmented version of doubled Khovanov homology to define a property

is a novel version of the influence maximization problem that necessitates new
analysis incorporating the type of propagation on each layer of the multiplex.
We identify a new property, generalized deterministic submodular, which when
satisfied by the propagation in each layer, ensures that the propagation on the
multiplex overall is submodular -- for this case, we formulate ISF, the greedy
algorithm with approximation ratio $(1 - 1/e)$. Since the size of a multiplex
comprising multiple OSNs may encompass billions of users, we formulate an
algorithm KSN that runs on each layer of the multiplex in parallel. KSN takes
an $\alpha$-approximation algorithm A for the influence maximization problem on
a single-layer network as input, and has approximation ratio
$\frac{(1-\epsilon)\alpha}{(o+1)k}$ for arbitrary $\epsilon > 0$, $o$ is the
number of overlapping users, and $k$ is the number of layers in the multiplex.
Experiments on real and synthesized multiplexes validate the efficacy of the
proposed algorithms for the problem of influence maximization in the

able to emerge when specific network structures underlie agents' interactions.
Notwithstanding, social dilemmas in which defection is highly tempting still
pose challenges concerning the effective sustainability of cooperation. Here we
propose a new redistribution mechanism that can be applied in structured

But modern algorithms for approximate Bayesian posterior inference often
sacrifice accurate posterior uncertainty estimation in the pursuit of

algorithms---which build a small, weighted subset of the data that approximates
the full dataset---are no exception. We demonstrate that these algorithms scale
the coreset log-likelihood suboptimally, resulting in underestimated posterior
uncertainty. To address this shortcoming, we develop greedy iterative geodesic
ascent (GIGA), a novel algorithm for Bayesian coreset construction that scales
the coreset log-likelihood optimally. GIGA provides geometric decay in
posterior approximation error as a function of coreset size, and maintains the
fast running time of its predecessors. The paper concludes with validation of
GIGA on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that it reduces
posterior approximation error by orders of magnitude compared with previous
coreset constructions.

task for the development of space electronics; it is difficult and
time-consuming and typically outweighs design and programming tasks in terms of

spacecraft engineers reduce the effort required for formal verification of
low-level control programs executed on custom hardware. The approach uses a
metalanguage to describe the semantics of a program as a state transformer,
which can be compiled to multiple targets for testing, formal verification, and
code generation. The metalanguage itself is embedded in a strongly-typed host
language (Haskell), providing a way to prove program properties at the type
level, which can shorten the feedback loop and further increase the
productivity of engineers.
  The verification approach is demonstrated on an industrial case study. We
present REDFIN, a processing core used in space missions, and its formal
semantics expressed using the proposed metalanguage, followed by a detailed
example of verification of a simple control program.

  Solution","FG2018, accepted as a long paper",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lifting is a common manual material handling task performed in the
workplaces. It is considered as one of the main risk factors for Work-related
Musculoskeletal Disorders. To improve work place safety, it is necessary to
assess musculoskeletal and biomechanical risk exposures associated with these
tasks, which requires very accurate 3D pose. Existing approaches mainly utilize
marker-based sensors to collect 3D information. However, these methods are
usually expensive to setup, time-consuming in process, and sensitive to the
surrounding environment. In this study, we propose a multi-view based deep
perceptron approach to address aforementioned limitations. Our approach
consists of two modules: a ""view-specific perceptron"" network extracts rich
information independently from the image of view, which includes both 2D shape
and hierarchical texture information; while a ""multi-view integration"" network
synthesizes information from all available views to predict accurate 3D pose.
To fully evaluate our approach, we carried out comprehensive experiments to
compare different variants of our design. The results prove that our approach
achieves comparable performance with former marker-based methods, i.e. an
average error of $14.72 \pm 2.96$ mm on the lifting dataset. The results are
also compared with state-of-the-art methods on HumanEva-I dataset, which
demonstrates the superior performance of our approach.

action of the Weyl group $W=N_G(T)/T$ of a semi-simple complex linear algebraic
group $G$, with maximal torus $T$, on the cohomology algebra of an arbitrary
Springer variety in the flag variety of $G$ from the viewpoint of torus
actions. Continuing the work [CK] which gave a sufficient condition for a group
$\mathcal{W}$ acting on the fixed point set of an algebraic torus action
$(S,X)$ on a complex projective variety $X$ to lift to a representation of
$\mathcal{W}$ on the cohomology algebra $H^*(X)$ (over $\mathbb{C}$), we
describe when the representation on $H^*(X)$ is equivalent to the
representation of $\mathcal{W}$ on the cohomology $H^*(X^S)$ of the fixed point
set. As a consequence of this theorem, we give a simple proof in type $A$ of
the Alvis-Lusztig-Treumann Theorem, which describes Springer's representation
of $W$ for Springer varieties corresponding to nilpotents in a Levi subalgebra
of Lie$(G)$. In the final two sections, we describe the local structure of the
moment graph $\mathfrak{M}(X)$ of a special torus action $(S,X)$, and we also
show that if a finite group $\mathcal{W}$ acts on the moment graph of $X$, then
$\mathcal{W}$ induces pair of actions on $H^*(X)$, namely the left and right or
dot and star actions of Knutson [Knu] and Tymoczko [Tym] respectively. In
particular, $W$ acts on the moment (or Bruhat) graph $\mathfrak{M}(G/P)$ of
$(T,G/P)$ for any parabolic $P$ in $G$ containing $T$, and the right action of
$W$ on $H^*(G/P)$ is an induced representation. Furthermore, we show the left

achieve a common goal. The goal is often unknown ex-ante, so prior work enables
agents to infer the goal from user input and assist with the task. Such methods
tend to assume some combination of knowledge of the dynamics of the
environment, the user's policy given their goal, and the set of possible goals
the user might target, which limits their application to real-world scenarios.
We propose a deep reinforcement learning framework for model-free shared
autonomy that lifts these assumptions. We use human-in-the-loop reinforcement
learning with neural network function approximation to learn an end-to-end
mapping from environmental observation and user input to agent action values,
with task reward as the only form of supervision. This approach poses the
challenge of following user commands closely enough to provide the user with
real-time action feedback and thereby ensure high-quality user input, but also
deviating from the user's actions when they are suboptimal. We balance these
two needs by discarding actions whose values fall below some threshold, then
selecting the remaining action closest to the user's input. Controlled studies
with users (n = 12) and synthetic pilots playing a video game, and a pilot
study with users (n = 4) flying a real quadrotor, demonstrate the ability of
our algorithm to assist users with real-time control tasks in which the agent
cannot directly access the user's private information through observations, but
receives a reward signal and user input that both depend on the user's intent.
The agent learns to assist the user without access to this private information,
implicitly inferring it from the user's input. This paper is a proof of concept
that illustrates the potential for deep reinforcement learning to enable
flexible and practical assistive systems.

are more heavily affected by initial acceptor removal than Boron-doped LGAD,
while the presence of Carbon reduces initial acceptor removal both for Gallium

proton irradiation is at least twice more effective in producing initial
acceptor removal, making proton irradiation far more damaging than neutron

risk of re-admission for a particular set of patients will be more
generalizable if developed with data from multiple institutions. While
privacy-protecting methods to build predictive models exist, most are based on
a centralized architecture, which presents security and robustness
vulnerabilities such as single-point-of-failure (and single-point-of-breach)

describe a new framework, ModelChain, to adapt Blockchain technology for
privacy-preserving machine learning. Each participating site contributes to
model parameter estimation without revealing any patient health information
(i.e., only model data, no observation-level data, are exchanged across
institutions). We integrate privacy-preserving online machine learning with a
private Blockchain network, apply transaction metadata to disseminate partial
models, and design a new proof-of-information algorithm to determine the order
of the online learning process. We also discuss the benefits and potential
issues of applying Blockchain technology to solve the privacy-preserving
healthcare predictive modeling task and to increase interoperability between
institutions, to support the Nationwide Interoperability Roadmap and national

NoduleX, a systematic approach to predict lung nodule malignancy from CT data,
based on deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN). For training and
validation, we analyze >1000 lung nodules in images from the LIDC/IDRI cohort.
All nodules were identified and classified by four experienced thoracic
radiologists who participated in the LIDC project. NoduleX achieves high
accuracy for nodule malignancy classification, with an AUC of ~0.99. This is
commensurate with the analysis of the dataset by experienced radiologists. Our
approach, NoduleX, provides an effective framework for highly accurate nodule
malignancy prediction with the model trained on a large patient population. Our
results are replicable with software available at

of local semiflows on complete metric spaces. These theorems are applied to the
nonlinear evolution equation $u_t+A u=f_\lambda(u)$ in a Banach space $X$,
where $A$ is a sectorial operator with compact resolvent. Assume that $0$ is
always a trivial stationary solution of the equation. We show that the global
dynamic bifurcation branch $\Gamma$ of a bifurcation point $(0,\lambda_0)$
either meets another bifurcation point $(0,\lambda_1)$, or is unbounded,
completely extending the well-known Rabinowitz Global Bifurcation Theorem on
operator equations to nonlinear evolution equations without any restrictions on
the crossing number. In the case where $f_\lambda(u)=\lambda u+f(u)$, due to
the {\em nonnegativity} of the Conley index we can even prove a stronger
conclusion asserting that only one possibility occurs for $\Gamma$, that is,
$\Gamma$ is necessarily unbounded. This result can be expected to help us have
a deeper understanding of the dynamics of nonlinear evolution equations.

Shockley-Queisser (SQ) limit, which is based on a detailed balance between

While the theory for this limit uses several assumptions, the requirements in
real devices have not been discussed fully. Given the current situation in
which research-level cell efficiencies are approaching the SQ limit, a
quantitative argument with regard to these requirements is worthwhile in terms
of understanding of the remaining loss mechanisms in current devices and the
device characteristics of solar cells that are operating outside the detailed
balance conditions. Here we examine two basic assumptions: (1) that the
photo-generated carriers lose their kinetic energy via phonon emission in a
moment (fast thermalization), and (2) that the photo-generated carriers are
extracted into carrier reservoirs in a moment (fast extraction). Using a model
that accounts for the carrier relaxation and extraction dynamics, we
reformulate the nonequilibrium theory for solar cells in a manner that covers
both the equilibrium and nonequilibrium regimes. Using a simple planar solar
cell as an example, we address the parameter regime in terms of the carrier
extraction time and then consider where the conventional SQ theory applies and
what could happen outside the applicable range.

This formulation shows the connection between the standard GAN training process

connection does not only provide a theoretical convergence proof for training
GANs in the function space, but also inspires a novel objective function for
training. The modified objective function forces the distribution of generator
outputs to be updated along the direction according to the primal-dual
subgradient methods. A toy example shows that the proposed method is able to
resolve mode collapse, which in this case cannot be avoided by the standard GAN

sequential decision making problems. In contexts where an agent interacts with
multiple entities, utility decomposition can be used to separate the global

arbitrator is then responsible for combining the individual utilities and
selecting an action in real time to solve the global problem. Although these
techniques can perform well empirically, they rely on strong assumptions of
independence between the local tasks and sacrifice the optimality of the global

solutions by learning a correction term represented by a neural network. We
demonstrate this approach on a fisheries management problem where multiple
boats must coordinate to maximize their catch over time as well as on a
pedestrian avoidance problem for autonomous driving. In each problem,
decomposition methods can scale to multiple boats or pedestrians by using
strategies involving one entity. We verify empirically that the proposed

stream or an interactive human user). Such capabilities are difficult to
integrate into classic regression-based approaches. We study performance as a
function of the number of classes $K$, including the extreme ""exemplar class""
setting where $K$ is equal to the number of training examples (140K in our
setting). Perhaps surprisingly, we show that classifiers can still be learned
in this setting. When compared to prior work in classification, our $K$ is
unprecedentedly large, including many ""fine-grained"" classes that are very
similar. We address these issues by using a multi-label loss function that
allows for training examples to be non-uniformly shared across discrete
classes. We perform a comprehensive experimental analysis of our method on
standard benchmarks, demonstrating state-of-the-art results for facial
alignment in videos.

of its human partner from his or her ongoing motion, and re-plans its own
actions in real time. This anticipative adaptation is desirable in many
practical scenarios, where humans are unable or unwilling to take on the
cognitive overhead required to explicitly communicate their intent to the
robot. A behavioral experiment indicates that the combination of goal inference

Multiple cameras on the infrastructure are simulated. The simulation of the

for implementing lightweight IoT applications, thanks to its underlying
asynchronous event-driven, non blocking I/O model. However, verifying the
correctness of programs with asynchronous nested callbacks is quite difficult,
and, hence, runtime monitoring can be a valuable support to tackle such a
complex task.
  Runtime monitoring is a useful software verification technique that
complements static analysis and testing, but has not been yet fully explored in
the context of Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Trace expressions have been
successfully employed for runtime monitoring in widespread multiagent system
platforms. Recently, their expressive power has been extended to allow
parametric specifications on data that can be captured and monitored only at
runtime. Furthermore, they can be language and system agnostic, through the
notion of event domain and type. This paper investigates the use of parametric
trace expressions as a first step towards runtime monitoring of programs
developed in Node.js and Node-RED, a flow-based IoT programming tool built on
top of Node.js. Runtime verification of such systems is a task that mostly
seems to have been overlooked so far in the literature.
  A prototype implementing the proposed system for Node.js, in order to
dynamically check with trace expressions the correct usage of API functions, is
presented. The tool exploits the dynamic analysis framework Jalangi for
monitoring Node.js programs and allows detection of errors that would be
difficult to catch with other techniques. Furthermore, it offers a simple REST
interface which can be exploited for runtime verification of Node-RED
components, and, more generally, IoT devices.

in a fan-spine configuration using multi-wavelength observations taken by SDO,
which occurred near the limb on 2016 January 9. In our study, first, we
estimated the fan-spine magnetic configuration with the potential field
calculation and found a sinistral small filament inside it. The filament along
with the flux rope erupted upward and interacted with the surrounding fan-
spine magnetic configuration, where the flux rope breaks in the middle section.
We observed compact brightening, flare ribbons and post-flare loops underneath
the erupting filament. The northern section of the flux rope reconnected with
the surrounding positive polarity, while the southern section straightened.
Next, we observed the untwisting motion of the southern leg, which was
transformed into a rotating helical blowout jet. The sign of the helicity of
the mini-filament matches the one of the rotating jet. This is consistent with
the jet models presented by Adams et al. (2014) and Sterling et al. (2015). We
focused on the fine thread structure of the rotating jet and traced three blobs
with the speed of 60-120 km/s, while the radial speed of the jet is approx 400
km/s. The untwisting motion of the jet accelerated plasma upward along the
collimated outer spine field lines, and it finally evolved into a narrow
coronal mass ejection at the height of approx 9 Rsun . On the basis of the
detailed analysis, we discussed clear evidence of the scenario of the breaking
of the flux rope and the formation of the helical blowout jet in the fan-spine
magnetic configuration.

challenges arise from provisioning quality-of-service (QoS) through
heterogenous interfaces of licensed and unlicensed bands. In this paper, we
minimize the required licensed spectrum without degrading the QoS in the

LWA is firstly derived by developing a new semi-Markov model. Multi-band
resource allocation with the QoS guarantee between the licensed and unlicensed

exploiting Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) and difference of two convex

interference and the unlicensed channel collision could seriously influence the
Quality of Service (QoS) and the energy consumption. In this paper, jointly
considering time-variant wireless channel conditions, dynamic traffic loads,

power allocation problem that enables minimizing the system power consumption
under a certain queue stability constraint in the LAA-enabled SBSs and Wi-Fi

molecules to encode information. One particular class of temporal dynamics is
persistent and transient signals, i.e. signals of long and short durations
respectively. It has been shown that the coherent type-1 feedforward loop with
an AND logic at the output (or C1-FFL for short) can be used to discriminate a
persistent input signal from a transient one. This has been done by modelling
the C1-FFL, and then use the model to show that persistent and transient input

structure of C1-FFL, this paper shows that it is possible to deduce the C1-FFL
model from the requirement of discriminating a persistent signal. We do this by
first formulating a statistical detection problem of distinguishing persistent
signals from transient ones. The solution of the detection problem is to
compute the log-likelihood ratio of observing a persistent signal to a
transient signal. We show that, if this log-likelihood ratio is positive, which
happens when the signal is likely to be persistent, then it can be
approximately computed by a C1-FFL. Although the capability of C1-FFL to
discriminate persistent signals is known, this paper adds an information

Anisotropic modelling (JAM) of the stellar kinematics for about 2000 early-type
galaxies (ETGs) and spiral galaxies from the MaNGA DR14 sample. Galaxies with
different morphologies are found to be located on a remarkably tight mass plane
which is close to the prediction of the virial theorem, extending previous
results for ETGs. By examining an inclined projection (`the mass-size' plane),
we find that spiral and early-type galaxies occupy different regions on the
plane, and their stellar population properties (i.e. age, metallicity and
stellar mass-to-light ratio) vary systematically along roughly the direction of
velocity dispersion, which is a proxy for the bulge fraction. Galaxies with
higher velocity dispersions have typically older ages, larger stellar
mass-to-light ratios and are more metal rich, which indicates that galaxies
increase their bulge fractions as their stellar populations age and become
enriched chemically. The age and stellar mass-to-light ratio gradients for
low-mass galaxies in our sample tend to be positive ($\rm centre<outer$), while
the gradients for most massive galaxies are negative. The metallicity gradients
show a clear peak around velocity dispersion $\log_{10} \sigma_{\rm e}\approx
2.0$, which corresponds to the critical mass $\sim 3\times 10^{10}M_{\odot}$ of
the break in the mass-size relation. Spiral galaxies with large mass and size
have the steepest gradients, while the most massive ETGs, especially above the
critical mass $M_{\rm crit}\ge 2\times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$, where slow rotator
ETGs start dominating, have much flatter gradients. This may be due to
differences in their evolution histories, e.g. mergers.

degradation at short wavelengths with the emergence of systematic spectral
features with an amplitude of about one percent. We show that these features
originate from inaccuracy in the fitting of modeled F-star spectra used for
flux calibration. The best-fit models for those stars are found to
systematically over-estimate the strength of metal lines and under-estimate
that of Lithium. We also identify the existence of artifacts due to masking and
interpolation procedures at the wavelengths of the hydrogen Balmer series
leading to the existence of artificial Balmer $\alpha$ absorption in all SDSS
optical spectra. All these effects occur in the rest-frame of the standard

vertices that intersect every edge of $H$. A linear hypergraph is one in which
every two distinct edges intersect in at most one vertex. A $k$-uniform
hypergraph has all edges of size $k$. It is known that $\tau(H) \le (n +
m)/(k+1)$ holds for all $k$-uniform, linear hypergraphs $H$ when $k \in
\{2,3\}$ or when $k \ge 4$ and the maximum degree of $H$ is at most two. It has
been conjectured that $\tau(H) \le (n+m)/(k+1)$ holds for all $k$-uniform,
linear hypergraphs $H$. We disprove the conjecture for large $k$, and show that
the best possible constant $c_k$ in the bound $\tau(H) \le c_k (n+m)$ has order
$\ln(k)/k$ for both linear (which we show in this paper) and non-linear
hypergraphs. We show that for those $k$ where the conjecture holds, it is tight
for a large number of densities if there exists an affine plane $AG(2,k)$ of
order $k \ge 2$. We raise the problem to find the smallest value, $k_{\min}$,
of $k$ for which the conjecture fails. We prove a general result, which when
applied to a projective plane of order $331$ shows that $k_{\min} \le 166$.
Even though the conjecture fails for large $k$, our main result is that it
still holds for $k=4$, implying that $k_{\min} \ge 5$. The case $k=4$ is much
more difficult than the cases $k \in \{2,3\}$, as the conjecture does not hold
for general (non-linear) hypergraphs when $k=4$. Key to our proof is the
completely new technique of the deficiency of a hypergraph introduced in this

  A quantum category is an opmonoidal monad on the monoidale associated to a
biduality $R\dashv R^{\circ}$, or enveloping monoidale, in a monoidal
bicategory of modules $\mathsf{Mod}(\mathcal{V})$ for a monoidal category

equivalence with right skew monoidales whose unit has a right adjoint in
$\mathsf{Mod}(\mathcal{V})$. Our first important result is similar to that of
Lack and Street. It is a characterisation of opmonoidal \emph{arrows} on
enveloping monoidales in terms of a new structure named \emph{oplax action}. We
then provide three different notions of comodule for an opmonoidal arrow, and
using a similar technique we prove that they are equivalent. Finally, when the
opmonoidal arrow is an opmonoidal monad, we are able to provide the category of
comodules for a quantum category with a monoidal structure such that the
forgetful functor is monoidal.

information through relatively slow changes in the emission rates of individual
spikes (rate code), or by the precise timing of every spike (temporal codes)?
Here we compare the loss of information due to correlations for these two
possible neural codes. The essence of Shannon's definition of information is to
combine information with uncertainty: the higher the uncertainty of a given
event, the more information is conveyed by that event. Correlations can reduce
uncertainty or the amount of information, but by how much? In this paper we
address this question by a direct comparison of the information per symbol
conveyed by the words coming from a binary Markov source (temporal codes) with
the information per symbol coming from the corresponding Bernoulli source
(uncorrelated, rate code source). In a previous paper we found that a crucial
role in the relation between Information Transmission Rates (ITR) and Firing
Rates is played by a parameter s, which is the sum of transitions probabilities
from the no-spike-state to the spike-state and vice versa. It turned out that
also in this case a crucial role is played by the same parameter s. We found
bounds of the quotient of ITRs for these sources, i.e. this quotient's minimal
and maximal values. Next, making use of the entropy grouping axiom, we
determined the loss of information in a Markov source in relation to its
corresponding Bernoulli source for a given length of word. Our results show
that in practical situations in the case of correlated signals the loss of
information is relatively small, thus temporal codes, which are more
energetically efficient, can replace the rate code effectively. These phenomena
were confirmed by experiments.

Quantum mechanics also suffers from a conceptual difficulty known as the
measurement problem. Early in his career, Hilary Putnam believed that
modifications of classical logic could both solve the measurement problem and
account for the two-slit phenomena. Over 40 years later he had abandoned
quantum logic in favor of the investigation of various theories--using
classical logic and probability theory--that can accomplish these tasks. The

limits on the number of signal events, with properties corresponding to those
reported by D0, and on the $X$ production rate relative to $B^0_s$ mesons,
$\rho_X$, were determined at 95% confidence level. The results are $N(X) < 382$

datasets, based on estimating the R\'{e}nyi entropy by minimum spanning trees
(MSTs). The length of the MSTs can be used to order pairs of variables from
strongly to weakly dependent, making it a useful tool for sensitivity analysis
with dependent input variables. It is well-suited for cases where the input
distribution is unknown and only a sample of the inputs is available. We
introduce an estimator to quantify dependency based on the MST length, and
investigate its properties with several numerical examples. To reduce the
computational cost of constructing the exact MST for large datasets, we explore
methods to compute approximations to the exact MST, and find the multilevel
approach introduced recently by Zhong et al. (2015) to be the most accurate. We
apply our proposed method to an artificial testcase based on the Ishigami
function, as well as to a real-world testcase involving sediment transport in
the North Sea. The results are consistent with prior knowledge and heuristic
understanding, as well as with variance-based analysis using Sobol indices in
the case where these indices can be computed.

a function of the NiO thickness, temperature and ferrimagnetic material where

Seebeck signal decays exponentially as a function of the NiO thickness, with a
spin-diffusion length for thermally-generated magnons of {\lambda}$_{MSDL}$ =
$1.6 \pm 0.2$ nm, largely independent on temperature. We see no enhancement of

(volume, $c/a$ ratio, and the internal $z$ position of Se) and the electronic
structure of the tetragonal (space group $P4/nmm$) paramagnetic FeSe. Our
results for the lattice parameters are in good quantitative agreement with
experiment. The $c/a$ ratio is slightly overestimated by about $3$~\%,
presumably due to the absence of the van der Waals interactions between the
FeSe layers in our calculations. The lattice parameters determined within DFT
are off the experimental values by a remarkable $\sim$$6$-$15$~\%, implying a
crucial importance of electron correlations. Upon compression to $10$~GPa, the
$c/a$ ratio and the lattice volume show a decrease by $2$ and $10$~\%,
respectively, while the Se $z$ coordinate weakly increases by $\sim$$2$~\%.
Most importantly, our results reveal a topological change of the Fermi surface
(Lifshitz transition) which is accompanied by a two- to three-dimensional
crossover. Our results indicate a small reduction of the quasiparticle mass
renormalization $m^*/m$ by about $5$~\% for the $e$ and less than $1$~\% for
the $t_2$ states, as compared to ambient pressure. The behavior of the
momentum-resolved magnetic susceptibility $\chi({\bf q})$ shows no topological
changes of magnetic correlations under pressure, but demonstrates a reduction

agreement with recent experiments on its isoelectronic counterpart

coronal temperatures produce the intensity pulsations of loops, and rain falls
along their legs if thermal runaway cools the periodic condensations down and

those systems whose electronic structure is poorly described within the

porous medium is studied by tracking thousands of bacteria in a microfluidic
chip containing randomly placed pillars. We first evaluate the spreading
dynamics of two populations of motile and non-motile bacteria injected at
different flow rates. In both cases, we observe that the mean and the variance
of the distances covered by the bacteria vary linearly with time and flow
velocity, a result qualitatively consistent with the standard geometric
dispersion picture. However, quantitatively, the motiles bacteria display a
systematic retardation effect when compared to the non-motile ones.
Furthermore, the shape of the traveled distance distribution in the flow
direction differs significantly for both the motile and the non-motile strain,
hence probing a markedly different exploration process. For the non-motile
bacteria, the distribution is Gaussian whereas for the motile ones, the
distribution displays a positive skewness and spreads exponentially downstream
akin to a Gamma distribution. The detailed microscopic study of the
trajectories reveals two salient effects characterizing the exploration process
of motile bacteria : (i) The emergence of an ""active"" retention effect due to
an extended exploration of the pore surfaces, (ii) an enhanced spreading at the
forefront due to the transport of bacteria along ""fast-tracks"" where they
acquire a velocity larger than the local flow velocity. We finally discuss the
practical applications of these effects on the large-scale macroscopic transfer
and contamination processes caused by microbes in natural environments.

conjunction with X-ray/optical/near-infrared data in order to measure the
corresponding spectral slopes and consequently remove the ambiguity wrt. slow
vs. fast cooling and the ordering of the characteristic frequencies.

sources remains unknown. One particular open question in this context is the
localization of burst emission to a singular active region or a larger area
across the neutron star. While several observational studies have attempted to
investigate this question by looking at the phase dependence of burst
properties, results have been mixed. At the same time, it is not obvious a
priori that bursts from a localized active region would actually give rise to a
detectable phase-dependence, taking into account issues such as geometry,
relativistic effects, and intrinsic burst properties such brightness and
duration. In this paper, we build a simple theoretical model to investigate the
circumstances under which the latter effects could affect detectability of a
dependence of burst emission on rotational phase. We find that even for
strongly phase-dependent emission, inferred burst properties may not show a
rotational phase dependence depending on the geometry of the system and the
observer. Furthermore, the observed properties of bursts with durations short
as 10-20% of the spin period can vary strongly depending on the rotational
phase at which the burst was emitted. We also show that detectability of a
rotational phase dependence depends strongly on the minimum number of bursts
observed, and find that existing burst samples may simply be too small to rule
out a phase dependence.

poorly to independent datasets. Recent studies have proposed to tune parameters

  data-sets",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, improvements in various image acquisition techniques gave
rise to the need for adaptive processing methods, aimed particularly for large
datasets corrupted by noise and deformations. In this work, we consider
datasets of images sampled from a low-dimensional manifold (i.e. an
image-valued manifold), where the images can assume arbitrary planar rotations.
To derive an adaptive and rotation-invariant framework for processing such
datasets, we introduce a graph Laplacian (GL)-like operator over the dataset,
termed ${\textit{steerable graph Laplacian}}$. Essentially, the steerable GL
extends the standard GL by accounting for all (infinitely-many) planar
rotations of all images. As it turns out, similarly to the standard GL, a
properly normalized steerable GL converges to the Laplace-Beltrami operator on
the low-dimensional manifold. However, the steerable GL admits an improved
convergence rate compared to the GL, where the improved convergence behaves as
if the intrinsic dimension of the underlying manifold is lower by one.
Moreover, it is shown that the steerable GL admits eigenfunctions of the form
of Fourier modes (along the orbits of the images' rotations) multiplied by
eigenvectors of certain matrices, which can be computed efficiently by the FFT.
For image datasets corrupted by noise, we employ a subset of these
eigenfunctions to ""filter"" the dataset via a Fourier-like filtering scheme,
essentially using all images and their rotations simultaneously. We demonstrate
our filtering framework by de-noising simulated single-particle cryo-EM image
datasets.

sufficient to combine penalisation of the divergence and the curl to achieve
high-quality results, but interestingly it seems crucial that the penalty
functional includes at least one component of the shear or suitable boundary
conditions. We investigate which requirements regarding the choice of weighting
parameters yield a rotational invariant approach. To guarantee physically

  nonconforming elements",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, three high-accuracy methods for eigenvalues of second order
elliptic operators are proposed by using the nonconforming Crouzeix-Raviart(CR
for short) element and the nonconforming enriched Crouzeix-Raviart(ECR for
short) element. They are based on a crucial full one order superconvergence of
the first order mixed Raviart-Thomas(RT for short) element. The main ingredient
of such a superconvergence analysis is to employ a discrete Helmholtz
decomposition of the difference between the canonical interpolation and the
finite element solution of the RT element. In particular, it allows for some
vital cancellation between terms in one key sum of boundary terms.
Consequently, a full one order superconvergence follows from a special relation
between the CR element and the RT element, and the equivalence between the ECR
element and the RT element for these two nonconforming elements. These
superconvergence results improve those in literature from a half order to a
full one order for the RT element, the CR element and the ECR element. Based on
the aforementioned superconvergence of the RT element, asymptotic expansions of
eigenvalues are established and employed to achieve high accuracy extrapolation
methods for these two nonconforming elements. In contrast to a classic analysis
in literature, the novelty herein is to use not only the canonical
interpolations of these nonconforming elements but also that of the RT element
to analyze such asymptotic expansions. Based on the superconvergence of these
nonconforming elements, asymptotically exact a posteriori error estimators of
eigenvalues are constructed and analyzed for them. Finally, two post-processing
methods are proposed to improve accuracy of approximate eigenvalues by

impurity pinned in the center of a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a
one-dimensional harmonic trapping potential by changing the bare mass of the
impurity and its interspecies interaction strength with the BEC. We model our
system by using two coupled differential equations for the condensate and the
single excited-impurity wave function, which we solve numerically. For
equilibrium, we obtain that an excited-impurity induces two bumps or dips on
the condensate for the attractive- or repulsive-interspecies coupling
strengths, respectively. Afterwards, we show that the excited-impurity induced
imprint upon the condensate wave function remains present during a
time-of-flight (TOF) expansion after having switched off the harmonic
confinement. We also investigate shock-waves or gray-solitons by switching off
the interspecies coupling strength in the presence of harmonic trapping
potential. During this process, we found out that the generation of gray
bi-soliton or gray quad-solitons (four-solitons) depends on the bare mass of
the excited-impurity in a harmonic trap.

a pilot-wave theory accounting for QFT phenomenology evaluating the robustness

although Bell's model should be interpreted as a heuristic example showing the
possibility to extend Bohm's pilot- wave theory to the domain of QFT, the same
judgement does not hold for the Bell-type QFT, which is candidate to be a
promising possible alternative proposal to the standard version of quantum

graphene resonators attracted attention as loudspeaker and ultrasound radio,

vibrations propagating through the substrate on which it was fabricated. We
achieve ultimately a resolution of $\approx7$~pm/$\mathrm{\sqrt Hz}$ in

can also be used for ultrasound detection. We observe a shift of 120~kHz at a
resonance frequency of 65~MHz for an induced vibration amplitude of 100~pm with
a resolution of 25~pm. Remarkably, the nonlinearity also explains the generally

pulled upon with an electrostatic gate. This work puts forward a sensor design
that fits onto an atomic force microscope cantilever and therefore promises
direct ultrasound detection at the nanoscale for nondestructive subsurface

to ask how positivity may be relaxed or generalised in a way which enables
similar calculations to be made in more general contexts. On the one hand one
may generalise by considering almost additive or asymptotically additive

positive matrix cocycle; on the other hand one may consider matrix cocycles
which are dominated, a condition which includes positive matrix cocycles but is

(the prover) attaches to the output with the aim of allowing efficient
verification (by the verifier) that this output is correct. Here, we consider
the minimal approximant basis problem, for which the fastest known algorithms
output a polynomial matrix of dimensions $m \times m$ and average degree $D/m$
using $O\tilde{~}(m^\omega \frac{D}{m})$ field operations. We propose a
certificate which, for typical instances of the problem, is computed by the
prover using $O(m^\omega \frac{D}{m})$ additional field operations and allows
verification of the approximant basis by a Monte Carlo algorithm with cost
bound $O(m^\omega + m D)$.
  Besides theoretical interest, our motivation also comes from the fact that
approximant bases arise in most of the fastest known algorithms for linear
algebra over the univariate polynomials; thus, this work may help in designing
certificates for other polynomial matrix computations. Furthermore,
cryptographic challenges such as breaking records for discrete logarithm
computations or for integer factorization rely in particular on computing
minimal approximant bases for large instances: certificates can then be used to
provide reliable computation on outsourced and error-prone clusters.

super-hydrophobic spheres. The mutual interaction between the air layer
(plastron) encapsulating the super-hydrophobic spheres and the flow is
emphasised by studying the hydrodynamic performances. It is found that the air
plastron adapts its shape to the flow-induced stresses which compete with the
surface tension. This competition is characterised by introducing the Weber
number $\mathcal{W}e$, whilst the plastron deformation is estimated via the
aspect ratio $\chi$. While noticeable distortions are locally observed, the
plastron becomes more and more spherical in average (i.e. $\chi \rightarrow 1$)
as far as $\mathcal{W}e$ increases. In comparison to the reference spheres,
high deformation of the air plastron plastron (oblate shape) leads to lift and
drag increase, whereas low deformation (spherical shape) yields lift and drag
mitigation. Accordingly, taking into account the plastron deformation provides
an attractive way to explain the somehow discordant results reported in other
studies at comparable Reynolds numbers. If confirmed by additional studies, our
findings would imply that plastron compliance and its feedback on the flow,
which are currently neglected in most theoretical works and numerical
simulations, must be accounted for to design super-hydrophobic surfaces and/or
predict their performances.

with the coupling to the field. The newly engineered artificial atomic systems
(such as quantum dots and superconducting circuits) proposed for quantum
information processing enjoy strong interaction with same type of systems or
even with other types in hybrid structures, which is coherently controllable
and moreover they can be efficiently coupled to radiation fields. We present an
exact analytic solution for the time evolution of a composite system of two
interacting two-level quantum systems coupled to a single mode radiation field,
which can be realized in cavity (circuit) QED. We show how the non-classical
dynamical properties of the composite system are affected and can be tuned by
introducing and varying the mutual coupling between the two systems.
Particularly, the collapse-revival pattern shows a splitting during the revival
intervals as the coupling ratio (system-system to system-field) increases,
which is a sign of an interruption in the system-radiation energy exchange
process. Furthermore, the time evolution of the bipartite entanglement between
the two systems is found to vary significantly depending on the coupling ratio
as well as the initial state of the composite system resulting in either an
oscillatory behavior or a collapse-revival like pattern. Increasing the
coupling ratio enhances the entanglement, raises its oscillation average value
and emphasizes the collapse-revival like pattern. However, raising the coupling
ratio beyond unity increases the revival time considerably. The effect of the
other system parameters such as detuning and radiation field intensity on the
system dynamics has been investigated as well.

it models both properties: asymptotic tail independence as well as heavy tails.

elicit connections between hidden regular variation and the behavior of tail
copula parameters extending previous works in this area. Then we study the
asymptotic behavior of the aforementioned conditional excess risk measures;
first under hidden regular variation and then under restrictions on the tail
copula parameters, not necessarily assuming hidden regular variation. We

discrete mass spectrum consisting all the experimentally known hadrons and the
exponentially rising continuous Hagedorn states. We confront the EoS of the

instances from seen categories but can generate well to those of unseen
categories. Typically, it is achieved by utilizing a semantic embedding space
to transfer knowledge from seen domain to unseen domain. Existing efforts
mainly focus on single-modal retrieval task, especially Image-Based Image
Retrieval (IBIR). However, as a highlighted research topic in the field of
hashing, cross-modal retrieval is more common in real world applications. To
address the Cross-Modal Zero-Shot Hashing (CMZSH) retrieval task, we propose a
novel Attribute-Guided Network (AgNet), which can perform not only IBIR, but
also Text-Based Image Retrieval (TBIR). In particular, AgNet aligns different
modal data into a semantically rich attribute space, which bridges the gap
caused by modality heterogeneity and zero-shot setting. We also design an
effective strategy that exploits the attribute to guide the generation of hash
codes for image and text within the same network. Extensive experimental
results on three benchmark datasets (AwA, SUN, and ImageNet) demonstrate the
superiority of AgNet on both cross-modal and single-modal zero-shot image
retrieval tasks.

continuous-time MSMs were presented as a conceptually appealing alternative for
survival analysis. In applied analyses, it is often assumed that the
theoretical treatment weights are known, but these weights are usually unknown

a class of continuous-time MSMs to be consistent even when the weights are

than IPTW when the underlying treatment process is continuous. Furthermore, we
may wish to transform effect estimates of hazards to other scales that are
easier to interpret causally. We show that a general transformation strategy

approximation of functions using redundant sets and frames. Redundancy in the
function representation offers enormous flexibility compared to using a basis,
but ill-conditioning often prevents the numerical computation of best
approximations. We showed that, in spite of said ill-conditioning,
approximations with regularization may still provide accuracy up to order
$\sqrt{\epsilon}$, where $\epsilon$ is a small truncation threshold. When using
frames, i.e. complete systems that are generally redundant but which provide
infinite representations with coefficients of bounded norm, this accuracy can
actually be achieved for all functions in a space. Here, we generalize that
setting in two ways. We assume information or samples from $f$ from a wide
class of linear operators acting on $f$, rather than inner products associated
with the best approximation projection. This enables the analysis of fully
discrete approximations based, for instance, on function values only. Next, we
allow oversampling, leading to least-squares approximations. We show that this
leads to much improved accuracy on the order of $\epsilon$ rather than
$\sqrt{\epsilon}$. Overall, we demonstrate that numerical function
approximation using redundant representations may lead to highly accurate
approximations in spite of having to solve ill-conditioned systems of
equations.

spectral gap of the graph can be bounded using a weighted discrete Hardy
inequality and the higher eigenvalues of the graph can be bounded by the
eigenvalues of a tridiagonal matrix times a multiplicative factor, both of
which only depend on the volume growth of the graph. As a direct application,
we relate the eigenvalues to the Cheeger isoperimetric constant. Using these

tight on the second eigenvalue. We also describe a method for proving Buser's

most pressing issues in cosmology. Bright QSOs are known to ionize their
surrounding neighborhood, but they are too few to ensure the required HI
ionizing background. A significant contribution by faint AGNs, however, could
solve the problem, as recently advocated on the basis of a relatively large
space density of faint active nuclei at z>4. We have carried out an exploratory
spectroscopic program to measure the HI ionizing emission of 16 faint AGNs
spanning a broad U-I color interval, with I~21-23 and 3.6<z<4.2. These AGNs are
three magnitudes fainter than the typical SDSS QSOs (M1450<~-26) which are
known to ionize their surrounding IGM at z>~4. The LyC escape fraction has been
detected with S/N ratio of ~10-120 and is between 44 and 100% for all the
observed faint AGNs, with a mean value of 74% at 3.6<z<4.2 and
-25.1<M1450<-23.3, in agreement with the value found in the literature for much
brighter QSOs (M1450<~-26) at the same redshifts. The LyC escape fraction of
our faint AGNs does not show any dependence on the absolute luminosities or on
the observed U-I colors. Assuming that the LyC escape fraction remains close to
~75% down to M1450~-18, we find that the AGN population can provide between 16
and 73% (depending on the adopted luminosity function) of the whole ionizing UV
background at z~4, measured through the Lyman forest. This contribution
increases to 25-100% if other determinations of the ionizing UV background are
adopted. Extrapolating these results to z~5-7, there are possible indications
that bright QSOs and faint AGNs can provide a significant contribution to the
reionization of the Universe, if their space density is high at M1450~-23.

fixed, while a time-varying tension is applied to the other end. We show that
the volume stretch and momentum converge (in an appropriate sense) to a weak
solution of a system of hyperbolic conservation laws (isothermal Euler
equations in Lagrangian coordinates) with boundary conditions. This result
includes the shock regime of the system. This is proven by adapting the theory

inequality that is in a local implementation of the accumulated advantage
principle. Such interactions destabilise the system. They are confronted in the
model with a global regulatory mechanism which reduces wealth inequality. There
are different scenarios emerging as a net effect of these two competing
mechanisms. When the effect of the global regulation (economic interventionism)
is too weak the system is unstable and it never reaches equilibrium. When the
effect is sufficiently strong the system evolves towards a limiting stationary
distribution with a Pareto tail. In between there is a critical phase. In this
phase the system may evolve towards a steady state with a multimodal wealth
distribution. The corresponding cumulative density function has a
characteristic stairway pattern which reflects the effect of economic
stratification. The stairs represent wealth levels of economic classes
separated by wealth gaps. As we show, the pattern is typical for macro-economic
systems with a limited economic freedom. One can find such a multimodal pattern
in empirical data, for instance, in the highest percentile of wealth
distribution for the population in urban areas of China.

three different equations, emphasizing that the techniques and ideas in the

  Its semilinear analogue is a conjecture on the Allen-Cahn equation posed by

results, as well as an open problem in high dimensions on the saddle-shaped
solution vanishing on the Simons cone.
  The third problem was raised by H. Brezis around 1996 and concerns the
boundedness of stable solutions to reaction-diffusion equations in bounded
domains. We present proofs on their regularity in low dimensions and discuss
the main open problem in this topic.

In this model, the material behaves as a viscoelastic solid when unyielded, and
as a viscoelastic Oldroyd-B fluid for stresses higher than the yield stress.
The porous media is made of a symmetric array of cylinders, and we solve the
flow in one periodic cell. We find that the solution is time-dependent even at
low Reynolds numbers as we observe oscillations in time of the unyielded region
especially at high Bingham numbers. The volume of the unyielded region slightly
decreases with the Reynolds number and strongly increases with the Bingham
number; up to 70% of the total volume is unyielded for the highest Bingham
numbers considered here. The flow is mainly shear dominated in the yielded
region, while shear and elongational flow are equally distributed in the
unyielded region. We compute the relation between the pressure drop and the
flow rate in the porous medium and present an empirical closure as function of
the Bingham and Reynolds numbers. The apparent permeability, normalized with
the case of Newtonian fluids, is shown to be greater than 1 at low Bingham
numbers, corresponding to lower pressure drops due to the flow elasticity, and
smaller than 1 for high Bingham numbers, indicating larger dissipation in the
flow owing to the presence of the yielded regions. Finally we investigate the
effect of the Weissenberg number on the distribution of the unyielded regions

adult with gonads that, in turn, produce gametes. Interruption of this germinal
cycle by prezygotic or postzygotic reproductive barriers can result in two
independent cycles, each with the potential to evolve into a new species. When
the speciation process is complete, members of each species are fully
reproductively isolated from those of the other. During speciation a primary
barrier may be supported and eventually superceded by a later appearing
secondary barrier. For those holding certain cases of prezygotic isolation to
be primary (e.g. elephant cannot copulate with mouse), the onus is to show that
they had not been preceded over evolutionary time by periods of postzygotic
hybrid inviability (genically determined) or sterility (genically or
chromosomally determined). Likewise, the onus is upon those holding cases of
hybrid inviability to be primary (e.g. Dobzhansky-Muller epistatic
incompatibilities), to show that they had not been preceded by periods, however
brief, of hybrid sterility. The latter, when acting as a sympatric barrier
causing reproductive isolation, can only be primary. In many cases, hybrid
sterility may result from incompatibilities between parental chromosomes that
attempt to pair during meiosis in the gonad of their offspring
(Winge-Crowther-Bateson incompatibilities). While WCB incompatibilities have
long been observed on a microscopic scale, there is growing evidence for a role
of dispersed finer DNA sequence differences.

oscillation spectrum in solar-type stars. They also cover the range between a

the existence of two relevant ionization regions. One of these regions, which
is located closer to the surface of the star, is commonly associated with the
second ionization of helium, although other chemical species also contribute to
ionization. The second region, located deeper in the envelope, is linked with
the ionization of heavy elements. Specifically, in this study, we analyze the
elements carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, neon, and iron. Both regions can be related

hotter stars, its influence becomes comparable to the influence of the region
of the second ionization of helium. This can guide us in the study of the outer

equivalently its uniformizing conformal map via a real-valued driving function
of its boundary. The first main result of the present paper is that the
Dirichlet energy of this driving function (also known as the Loewner energy) is
equal to the Dirichlet energy of the log-derivative of the (appropriately
defined) uniformizing conformal map.
  This description of the Loewner energy then enables to tie direct links with
regularized determinants and Teichm\""uller theory: We show that for smooth
simple loops, the Loewner energy can be expressed in terms of the
zeta-regularized determinants of a certain Neumann jump operator. We also show
that the family of finite Loewner energy loops coincides with the
Weil-Petersson class of quasicircles, and that the Loewner energy equals to a
multiple of the universal Liouville action introduced by Takhtajan and Teo,
which is a K\""ahler potential for the Weil-Petersson metric on the
Weil-Petersson Teichm\""uller space.

context of general relativity as well as with modifications of gravity that
strongly depart from the standard paradigm such as MOND. However, at present
there are no studies that aim to test the impact that less extreme
modifications of gravity (e.g. models constructed as alternatives to dark
energy) have on the behaviour of globular clusters. This Letter presents fits
to the velocity dispersion profile of the cluster NGC 2419 under the symmetron
modified gravity model. The data shows an increase in the velocity dispersion
towards the centre of the cluster which could be difficult to explain within
general relativity. By finding the best fitting solution associated with the
symmetron model, we show that this tension does not exist in modified gravity.
However, the best fitting parameters give a model that is inconsistent with the
dynamics of the Solar System. Exploration of different screening mechanisms
should give us the chance to understand if it is possible to maintain the
appealing properties of the symmetron model when it comes to globular clusters
and at the same time recover the Solar System dynamics properly.

$r$ around each vertex induces a graph isomorphic to the ball of radius $r$ in
some fixed vertex-transitive graph $F$, for various choices of $F$ and $r$.
This is a natural extension of the study of regular graphs. More precisely, if
$F$ is a vertex-transitive graph and $r \in \mathbb{N}$, we say a graph $G$ is
{\em $r$-locally $F$} if the ball of radius $r$ around each vertex of $G$
induces a graph isomorphic to the graph induced by the ball of radius $r$
around any vertex of $F$. We consider the following random graph model: for
each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we let $G_n = G_n(F,r)$ be a graph chosen uniformly at
random from the set of all unlabelled, $n$-vertex graphs that are $r$-locally
$F$. We investigate the properties possessed by the random graph $G_n$ with
high probability, for various natural choices of $F$ and $r$.
  We prove that if $F$ is a Cayley graph of a torsion-free group of polynomial
growth, and $r$ is sufficiently large depending on $F$, then the random graph
$G_n = G_n(F,r)$ has largest component of order at most $n^{5/6}$ with high
probability, and has at least $\exp(n^{\delta})$ automorphisms with high
probability, where $\delta>0$ depends upon $F$ alone. Both properties are in
stark contrast to random $d$-regular graphs, which correspond to the case where
$F$ is the infinite $d$-regular tree. We also show that, under the same
hypotheses, the number of unlabelled, $n$-vertex graphs that are $r$-locally
$F$ grows like a stretched exponential in $n$, again in contrast with
$d$-regular graphs. In the case where $F$ is the standard Cayley graph of
$\mathbb{Z}^d$, we obtain a much more precise enumeration result, and more
precise results on the properties of the random graph $G_n(F,r)$. Our proofs
use a mixture of results and techniques from geometry, group theory and

comparison with the results of hydrodynamical simulations of the ISM evolution
for a large set of isolated ETGs. After the epoch of major galaxy formation
(after z~2), the ISM is replenished by stellar mass losses and SN ejecta, at
the rate predicted by stellar evolution, and is depleted by star formation; it
is heated by the thermalization of stellar motions, SNe explosions and the
mechanical (from winds) and radiative AGN feedback. The models agree well with
the observed relations, even for the largely different Lx values at the same
mass, thanks to the sensitivity of the gas flow to many galaxy properties; this
holds for models including AGN feedback, and those without. Therefore, the mass
input from the stellar population is able to account for a major part of the
observed Lx; and AGN feedback, while very important to maintain massive ETGs in
a time-averaged quasi-steady state, keeping low star formation and the black
hole mass, does not dramatically alter the gas content originating in stellar
recycled material. These conclusions are based on theoretical predictions for
the stellar population contributions in mass and energy, and on a
self-consistent modeling of AGN feedback.

morphologically different but superimposed photon flux components present in

simultaneously decomposing them into diffuse, point-like and uninteresting
background radiation fluxes. The decomposition is based on a probabilistic
hierarchical Bayesian parameter model within the framework of information field
theory (IFT). In contrast to its predecessor D$^3$PO, D$^4$PO reconstructs
multi-domain components. Thereby each component is defined over its own direct
product of multiple independent domains, for example location and energy.
D$^4$PO has the capability to reconstruct correlation structures over each of
the sub-domains of a component separately. Thereby the inferred correlations
implicitly define the morphologically different source components, except for
the spatial correlations of the point-like flux. Point-like source fluxes are
spatially uncorrelated by definition. The capabilities of the algorithm are
demonstrated by means of a synthetic, but realistic, mock data set, providing
spectral and spatial information about each detected photon. D$^4$PO
successfully denoised, deconvolved, and decomposed a photon count image into
diffuse, point-like and background flux, each being functions of location as
well as energy. Moreover, uncertainty estimates of the reconstructed fields as
well as of their correlation structure are provided employing their posterior
density function and accounting for the manifolds the domains reside on.

transducer uses Muller acceptance and $\omega$-regular look-ahead. \RTEs are
constructed from constant functions using the combinators if-then-else
(deterministic choice), Hadamard product, and unambiguous versions of the
Cauchy product, the 2-chained Kleene-iteration and the 2-chained
omega-iteration. Our proof works for transformations of both finite and
infinite words, extending the result on finite words of Alur et al.\ in
LICS'14. In order to construct an RTE associated with a deterministic two-way
Muller transducer with look-ahead, we introduce the notion of transition monoid
for such two-way transducers where the look-ahead is captured by some backward
deterministic B\""uchi automaton. Then, we use an unambiguous version of Imre
Simon's famous forest factorization theorem in order to derive a ""good""
($\omega$-)regular expression for the domain of the two-way transducer. ""Good""
expressions are unambiguous and Kleene-plus as well as $\omega$-iterations are
only used on subexpressions corresponding to \emph{idempotent} elements of the
transition monoid. The combinator expressions are finally constructed by
structural induction on the ""good"" ($\omega$-)regular expression describing the
domain of the transducer.

to detect when the occlusion occurs so that information predicted from occluded

Occluded Stacked Hourglass, based on the work of original Stacked Hourglass
network for body pose joint estimation, which is retrained to process a
detected face window and output 68 occlusion heat maps, each corresponding to a
facial landmark. Landmark location, occlusion levels and a refined face
detection score, to reject false positives, are extracted from these heat maps.
Using the facial landmark locations, features such as head pose and eye/mouth
openness can be extracted to derive driver attention and activity. The system
is evaluated for face detection, head pose, and occlusion estimation on various

data has created an increase in real-time data processing such as recognition
of speech, image, and video. While currently such processes are offloaded to
the computationally powerful cloud system, a localized and distributed approach
is desirable because (i) it preserves the privacy of users and (ii) it omits
the dependency on cloud services. However, IoT networks are usually composed of
resource-constrained devices, and a single device is not powerful enough to
process real-time data. To overcome this challenge, we examine data and model
parallelism for such devices in the context of deep neural networks. We propose
Musical Chair to enable efficient, localized, and dynamic real-time recognition
by harvesting the aggregated computational power from the resource-constrained
devices in the same IoT network as input sensors. Musical chair adapts to the
availability of computing devices at runtime and adjusts to the inherit
dynamics of IoT networks. To demonstrate Musical Chair, on a network of
Raspberry PIs (up to 12) each connected to a camera, we implement a
state-of-the-art action recognition model for videos and two recognition models
for images. Compared to the Tegra TX2, an embedded low-power platform with a
six-core CPU and a GPU, our distributed action recognition system achieves not
only similar energy consumption but also twice the performance of the TX2.
Furthermore, in image recognition, Musical Chair achieves similar performance
and saves dynamic energy.

is no self-consistent dynamical theory of such bodies in the literature.
Electromagnetic energy-momentum is not conserved in the presence of charge and
some addition is required. The only somewhat suitable addition found to date
are point charges. These suffer from infinite self-energy, requiring some
renormalization procedure, and perturbative methods to account for radiation.
We review the history that has led to the understanding of these facts.
  We then investigate possible self-consistent, non-point-charge, classical
electrodynamic theories. We start with a Lagrangian consisting only of the
Ricci scalar (gravity) and the standard electromagnetic field Lagrangian, and
consider additions other than point charges and their associated interaction
Lagrangian. Including quadratic terms in the Lagrangian involving first-order
derivatives of the electromagnetic field tensor provides sufficient
stress-energy terms to allow for conservation of energy-momentum. There are
three such independent terms: a direct current-current interaction and two
curvature-mediated (non-minimally coupled), short-range interactions, one of
which changes sign under a parity transformation. These could be interpreted as
non-electromagnetic, short-range forces.
  For the simplest possible theory, with only the metric and the
electromagnetic potential 1-form as independent fields, we find a single,
stable, spherical (spin-0) solution, which due to an integrable singularity at
the solution's center, has quantized mass and charge. Its charge is smaller
than numeric error, and its mass is set by a new constant in the Lagrangian. It
has a small, central core of charge surrounded by a wave of alternatingly
charged, spherical shells, where the amplitude of the charge density wave is
inversely proportional to the radial coordinate.

on-line energy discriminating stage. For the optimization of its hardwired
internal limits we analyzed the system energy space. We explored different
solutions dependent or not on the system's energy calibration. Results obtained
through the different filter versions confirm the minimal resources consumption
of such processing techniques implemented at DAQ front-end level. Our
experiences showed how the filtering process reduces the bandwidth needs
excluding from the data stream all non valid energy events and thus improving
the system sensitivity under saturation conditions. Additionally, these
experiments highlight how setting proper energy limits we ensure the
preservation of the system performance, which maintains its original energy and
time resolution. Under the light of these findings, we see a great potential on
the application of on-line processing techniques for Time-Of-Flight PET at the

boundary value problems with heterogeneous diffusion coefficients and with
singular source terms. When the diffusion coefficient is heterogeneous, this
adds to the computational costs, and this difficulty is compounded by a
singular source term. For singular source terms, the solution does not belong
to the Sobolev space $H^1$, but to the space $W^{1,p}$ for some $p<2$. Hence,
the problem may be reformulated in a distance-weighted Sobolev space. Using
this formulation, we develop a method to upscale the multiscale coefficient
near the singular sources by incorporating corrections into the coarse-grid.
Using a sub-grid correction method, we correct the basis functions in a
distance-weighted Sobolev space and show that these corrections can be
truncated to design a computationally efficient scheme with optimal convergence
rates. Due to the nature of the formulation in weighted spaces, the variational
form must be posed on the cross product of complementary spaces. Thus, two such
sub-grid corrections must be computed, one for each multiscale space of the
cross product. A key ingredient of this method is the use of
quasi-interpolation operators to construct the fine scale spaces. Therefore, we
develop a weighted projective quasi-interpolation that can be used for a
general class of Muckenhoupt weight functions. We verify the optimal
convergence of the method in some numerical examples with singular point
sources and line fractures, and with oscillatory and heterogeneous diffusion
coefficients.

improve performance. Therefore, sharing trained models has been very important
for the rapid progress of research and development. In addition, trained models
could be important assets for the owner(s) who trained them, hence we regard
trained models as intellectual property. In this paper, we propose a digital
watermarking technology for ownership authorization of deep neural networks.
First, we formulate a new problem: embedding watermarks into deep neural
networks. We also define requirements, embedding situations, and attack types
on watermarking in deep neural networks. Second, we propose a general framework
for embedding a watermark in model parameters, using a parameter regularizer.
Our approach does not impair the performance of networks into which a watermark
is placed because the watermark is embedded while training the host network.
Finally, we perform comprehensive experiments to reveal the potential of
watermarking deep neural networks as the basis of this new research effort. We
show that our framework can embed a watermark during the training of a deep
neural network from scratch, and during fine-tuning and distilling, without
impairing its performance. The embedded watermark does not disappear even after
fine-tuning or parameter pruning; the watermark remains complete even after 65%
of parameters are pruned.

potentially slowing the penetration of autonomous vehicles, and consequently
slowing the realization of the societal benefits of autonomous vehicles. We
propose here a new approach to autonomous driving that will re-balance the
responsibility and liabilities associated with autonomous driving between
traditional automotive manufacturers, infrastructure players, and third-party
players. Our proposed distributed intelligence architecture leverages the
significant advancements in connectivity and edge computing in the recent
decades to partition the driving functions between the vehicle, edge computers
on the road side, and specialized third-party computers that reside in the
vehicle. Infrastructure becomes a critical enabler for autonomy. With this
Infrastructure Enabled Autonomy (IEA) concept, the traditional automotive
manufacturers will only need to shoulder responsibility and liability
comparable to what they already do today, and the infrastructure and
third-party players will share the added responsibility and liabilities
associated with autonomous functionalities. We propose a Bayesian Network Model
based framework for assessing the risk benefits of such a distributed
intelligence architecture. An additional benefit of the proposed architecture
is that it enables ""autonomy as a service"" while still allowing for private

decision-making in non-stationary and partially observable environments. In a
BCO problem, a decision-maker sequentially picks actions to minimize the
cumulative cost associated with these decisions, all while receiving partial
feedback about the state of the environment. This formulation is a very natural
fit for wireless-network optimisation problems and has great application
potential since: i) instead of assuming full observability of the network
state, it only requires the metric to optimise as input, and ii) it provides
strong performance guarantees while making only minimal assumptions about the
network dynamics. Despite these advantages, BCO has not yet been explored in
the context of wireless-network optimisation. In this paper, we make the first

costs of conventional generators. As the share of energy supplied by renewable
sources increases, these costs also increase. In this paper, we quantify these
costs by developing a market clearing price of energy in the presence of
renewable energy and congestion constraints. We consider an electricity market
where generators propose their asking price per unit of energy to an
independent system operator (ISO). The ISO solve an optimization problem to
dispatch energy from each generator to minimize the total cost of energy
purchased on behalf of the consumers.
  To ensure that the generators are able to meet the load within a desired
confidence level, we incorporate the notion of load variance using the
Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVAR) measure in an electricity market and we derive
the amount of committed power and market clearing price of energy as a function
of CVAR. It is shown that a higher penetration of renewable energies may
increase the committed power, market clearing price of energy and consumer cost
of energy due to renewable generation uncertainties. We also obtain an
upper-bound on the amount that congestion constraints can affect the committed

gasification of municipal solid waste (MSW) during gasification in a fluidized
bed reactor. These artificial neural networks (ANNs) with different
architectures are trained using the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) back-propagation
algorithm and a cross validation is also performed to ensure that the results
generalise to other unseen datasets. A rigorous study is carried out on
optimally choosing the number of hidden layers, number of neurons in the hidden
layer and activation function in a network using multiple Monte Carlo runs.
Nine input and three output parameters are used to train and test various
neural network architectures in both multiple output and single output
prediction paradigms using the available experimental datasets. The model
selection procedure is carried out to ascertain the best network architecture
in terms of predictive accuracy. The simulation results show that the ANN based
methodology is a viable alternative which can be used to predict the
performance of a fluidized bed gasifier.
