quasiparticle model with the finite baryon chemical potential adjusted to
lattice QCD calculations. Here, we investigate the possibility that the
effective quasiparticle mass is also a function of its momentum, $k$, in
addition to temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\mu$. It is found that the
thermodynamic consistency can be expressed in terms of an integro-differential
equation concerning $k$, $T$, and $\mu$. We further discuss two special
solutions, both can be viewed as sufficient condition for the thermodynamical
consistency, while expressed in terms of a particle differential equation. The
first case is shown to be equivalent to those previously discussed by Peshier
et al. The second one, obtained through an ad hoc assumption, is an
intrinsically different solution where the particle mass is momentum dependent.
These equations can be solved by using boundary condition determined by the
lattice QCD data at vanishing baryon chemical potential. By numerical
calculations, we show that both solutions can reasonably reproduce the recent
lattice QCD results of the Wuppertal-Budapest and HotQCD Collaborations, and in
particular, those concerning finite baryon density. Possible implications are
discussed.

radio-loud QSO PMN 0134-0931. The CO J=2-1 and HCO+ J=2-1 lines are seen in
absorption along two different lines of sight to lensed images of the
background QSO. The lines of sight are separated by ~0.7"", corresponding to 5
kpc in the lens plane. PMN 0134-0931 represents one out of only five known
molecular absorption line systems at cosmologically significant distances.
Moreover, it is also one of three such systems where the absorption occurs in a
galaxy acting as a gravitational lens. The absorption lines through the two
lines of sight are shifted by 215+/-8 km/s, possibly representing rotational
motion in one of the lensing galaxies. The absorption profiles are wide, ~200
km/s, suggesting that the absorption occurs in a highly inclined disk galaxy
with a flat rotation curve and a cloud-cloud velocity dispersion ~30 km/s.
Gravitational lens models require two equal mass galaxies to account for the
observed configuration of lensed images. The presence of two galaxies in close
proximity means that they might be interacting and potentially merging and the
kinematics of the molecular gas may not reflect ordered rotational motion. The
column densities of both CO and HCO+ are normal for diffuse molecular gas
towards one of the lensed images, but significantly higher towards the other.
Also, the abundance ratio N(CO)/N(HCO+) is 2-3 times higher than in typical
diffuse molecular gas. It is plausible that the second line of sight probes
denser molecular gas than what is normally the case for absorption.

height function and the weight function. The main difficulties arise when the
support of the weight function is unbounded, since the corresponding graph is

  There are two principal results, of which the first is a condition under

human-centred environments, there is a need to control the risk of collision.
Perceptual modules, for example machine vision, provide uncertain estimates of
object location. In that context, the frequently made assumption of an exactly
known free-space is invalid. Clearly, no paths can be guaranteed to be
collision free. Instead, it is necessary to compute the probabilistic risk of
collision on any proposed path. The FPR algorithm, proposed here, efficiently
calculates an upper bound on the risk of collision for a robot moving on the
plane. That computation orders candidate trajectories according to (the bound
on) their degree of risk. Then paths within a user-defined threshold of primary
risk could be selected according to secondary criteria such as comfort and
efficiency. The key contribution of this paper is the FPR algorithm and its
`convolution trick' to factor the integrals used to bound the risk of
collision. As a consequence of the convolution trick, given $K$ obstacles and
$N$ candidate paths, the computational load is reduced from the naive $O(NK)$,
to the qualitatively faster $O(N+K)$.

symmetron and DGP gravity. We develop an excursion-set method to generalise a
range of popular HMF fitting functions from GR to screened MG, considering the
HMF dependence on the critical density parameter $\delta_{c}$. In particular,
we propose a variety of new methods to account for the environmental dependence
of chameleon screening and compare their accuracy to existing ones via $N$-body
data. Finally, using the nested sampling routine MultiNest, we examine two
possible interpretations of the MG $N$-body results: whether they can be
interpreted as $\Lambda$CDM HMFs and whether the MG HMFs display any
universality.
  We find that the effects of MG can be interpreted as a change in best-fit
parameters in the $\Lambda$CDM HMF---i.e. can be mistaken for GR---for all of
the fitting functions. Alternatively, the relation can be inverted to judge the
universality of the HMF---not in terms of its purported invariance to $z$,
$H_{0}$, $\Omega_{m}$, $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ as in GR, but its independence on the
underlying theory of gravity. Although we found no completely universal HMF,
the parameter values did cluster according to the type of screening mechanism.
The results suggest that a single, best-fit HMF might be used for each type of
screening, independent of the parameters in the MG model. This demonstrates
that the additional complexity of the gravitational collapse in screened MG
theories cannot always be accounted for using the techniques developed in GR.
However, the variations are small enough that it is unnecessary to develop new
fitting functions and calibrate them on a case-by-case basis.

give a prescription for how to perform the discrete gauging at the level of the
superconformal index and Higgs branch Hilbert series. We interpret and match
the information encoded in these indices to known results for rank one
$\mathcal{N}=3$ theories. Our prescription is easily generalised for the
Coloumb branch and the Higgs branch indices of higher rank theories, allowing
us to make new predictions for these theories. Most strikingly we find that the

relativistic wind from a central compact object. A recent two-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulation studying the dynamical evolution of supernova ejecta
with a central energy source has revealed that outermost layers of the ejecta
are accelerated to mildly relativistic velocities because of the breakout of a
hot bubble driven by the energy injection. The outermost layers decelerate as
they sweep a circumstellar medium surrounding the ejecta, leading to the
formation of the forward and reverse shocks propagating in the circumstellar
medium and the ejecta. While the ejecta continue to release the internal energy
as thermal emission from the photosphere, the energy dissipation at the forward
and reverse shock fronts gives rise to non-thermal emission. We calculate light
curves and spectral energy distributions of thermal and non-thermal emission
from central engine powered supernova ejecta embedded in a steady stellar wind
with typical mass loss rates for massive stars. The light curves are compared
with currently available radio and X-ray observations of hydrogen-poor
superluminous supernovae, as well as the two well-studied broad-lined Ic
supernovae, 1998bw and 2009bb, which exhibit bright radio emission indicating
central engine activities. We point out that upper limits on radio luminosities
of nearby superluminous supernovae may indicate the injected energy is mainly
converted to thermal radiation rather than creating mildly relativistic flows
owing to photon diffusion time scales comparable to the injection time scale.

formulate a conjecture that the time integral of energy fluctuations over the

the quantum speed limit (QSL). We prove the conjecture for arbitrary,
sufficiently slow protocols using adiabatic perturbation theory and show that
the bound is saturated by geodesic protocols, which keep the energy variance
constant along the trajectory. Our conjecture implies that any optimal
unit-fidelity protocol, even those that drive the system far from equilibrium,
are fundamentally constrained by the quantum geometry of adiabatic evolution.
When the control space includes all possible couplings, spanning the full
Hilbert space, we recover the well-known Mandelstam-Tamm bound. However, using
only accessible local controls to anneal in complex models such as glasses or
to target individual excited states in quantum chaotic systems, the geometric
bound for the quantum speed limit can be exponentially large in the system size
due to a diverging geodesic length. We validate our conjecture both
analytically by constructing counter-diabatic and fast-forward protocols for a

long-range ordering/reorientation of 4fRe3+ and/or 3dMn3+ spins below room
temperature. These transitions have attracted a lot of attention in recent
years due to the geometrically frustrated nature of magnetic interactions. We
have revisited these transitions in high quality single crystals of h-DyMnO3
using dc and ac susceptibility measurements as a function of temperature (T),
magnetic field (H) and frequency (w) supplemented by specific heat
measurements. Taking h-DyMnO3 as an example, we show that the Dy3+ spins below
TN~68K are in a superferrimagnetic (SFIM) state whereas they undergo spin-glass
(SG) transition below TDy3+~7K. Our observations demonstrate that neither the
N\'eel transition at TN~68K nor the transition at TDy3+~7K is associated with
long-range ordered states of Dy3+ spins as believed so far in the literature.
The SG state of h-DyMnO3 is quite exotic as it occurs in an ordered compound
purely due to geometrical frustration without any random disorder. Further, it
shows an interesting crossover from de Almeida-Thouless type exponent (m=2/3)
to Gabay-Toulouse type (m=2) with increasing field which cannot be explained in
terms of the existing mean field theories of SG transition in Ising or

constructing the approximating set consists of $X_1,...,X_N$ that are
independent and distributed as $X$.
  We present a general method that can be used to construct such approximations
and implement it for two types of approximating sets. We first construct a
(random) set ${\cal K}$ defined by a union of intersections of slabs
$H_{z,\alpha}=\{v \in \mathbb{R}^d : |<z,v>| \leq \alpha\}$ (and therefore
${\cal K}$ is actually the output of a neural network with two hidden layers).
The slabs are generated using $X_1,...,X_N$, and under minimal assumptions on
$X$ (e.g., $X$ can be heavy-tailed) it suffices that $N = c_1d
\eta^{-4}\log(2/\eta)$ to ensure that $(1-\eta) {\cal K} \subset {\cal B}
\subset (1+\eta){\cal K}$. In some cases (e.g., if $X$ is rotation invariant
and has marginals that are well behaved in some weak sense), a smaller sample
size suffices: $N = c_1d\eta^{-2}\log(2/\eta)$.
  We then show that if the slabs are replaced by randomly generated ellipsoids
defined using $X_1,...,X_N$, the same degree of approximation is true when $N
\geq c_2d\eta^{-2}\log(2/\eta)$.
  The construction we use is based on the small-ball method.

cognate sets. Our findings suggest that phylogenies inferred from automated
cognate sets come close to phylogenies inferred from expert-annotated ones,
although on average, the latter are still superior. We conclude that future
work on phylogenetic reconstruction can profit much from automatic cognate
detection. Especially where scholars are merely interested in exploring the
bigger picture of a language family's phylogeny, algorithms for automatic
cognate detection are a useful complement for current research on language
phylogenies.

similar images. Previous attempts to combine RSA with neural image captioning
require an inference which normalizes over the entire set of possible
utterances. This poses a serious problem of efficiency, previously solved by
sampling a small subset of possible utterances. We instead solve this problem
by implementing a version of RSA which operates at the level of characters
(""a"",""b"",""c""...) during the unrolling of the caption. We find that the
utterance-level effect of referential captions can be obtained with only
character-level decisions. Finally, we introduce an automatic method for
testing the performance of pragmatic speaker models, and show that our model
outperforms a non-pragmatic baseline as well as a word-level RSA captioner.

nuclear engineering problems with mixed-integer and combinatorial design

evaluations. Gnowee's hybrid metaheuristic framework is a new combination of a
set of diverse, robust heuristics that appropriately balance diversification
and intensification strategies across a wide range of optimization problems.
  This novel algorithm was specifically developed to optimize complex nuclear
design problems; the motivating research problem was the design of material
stack-ups to modify neutron energy spectra to specific targeted spectra for
applications in nuclear medicine, technical nuclear forensics, nuclear physics,
etc. However, there are a wider range of potential applications for this
algorithm both within the nuclear community and beyond. To demonstrate Gnowee's
behavior for a variety of problem types, comparisons between Gnowee and several
well-established metaheuristic algorithms are made for a set of eighteen
continuous, mixed-integer, and combinatorial benchmarks. These results
demonstrate Gnoweee to have superior flexibility and convergence
characteristics over a wide range of design spaces. We anticipate this wide

by the highly non-linear nature of the underlying magnetohydrodynamic problem.
Numerical simulations of the liquid outer core, where regeneration occurs, are
only able to model conditions that are far from Earth-like. On the analytical
front, the situation is not much better; basic calculations, such as relating
the average rate of reversals to various core parameters, have apparently been
intractable. Here, we present a framework for solving such problems. Starting
with the magnetic induction equation, we show that by considering its sources
to be stochastic processes with fairly general properties, we can derive a
differential equation for the joint probability distribution of the dominant
toroidal and poloidal modes. This can be simplified to a Fokker-Planck equation
and, with the help of an adiabatic approximation, reduced even further to an
equation for the dipole amplitude alone. From these equations various
quantities related to the magnetic field, including the average reversal rate,
field strength, and time to complete a reversal, can be computed as functions
of a small number of numerical parameters. These parameters in turn can be
computed from physical considerations or constrained by paleomagnetic,

an unknown Hamiltonian cycle in an $n$-vertex complete graph that needs to be
inferred from noisy edge measurements. The measurements are independent and
distributed according to $\calP_n$ for edges in the cycle and $\calQ_n$
otherwise. This formulation is motivated by a problem in genome assembly, where
the goal is to order a set of contigs (genome subsequences) according to their
positions on the genome using long-range linking measurements between the
contigs. Computing the maximum likelihood estimate in this model reduces to a
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Despite the NP-hardness of TSP, we show that
a simple linear programming (LP) relaxation, namely the fractional $2$-factor
(F2F) LP, recovers the hidden Hamiltonian cycle with high probability as $n \to
\infty$ provided that $\alpha_n - \log n \to \infty$, where $\alpha_n
\triangleq -2 \log \int \sqrt{d P_n d Q_n}$ is the R\'enyi divergence of order
$\frac{1}{2}$. This condition is information-theoretically optimal in the sense
that, under mild distributional assumptions, $\alpha_n \geq (1+o(1)) \log n$ is
necessary for any algorithm to succeed regardless of the computational cost.
  Departing from the usual proof techniques based on dual witness construction,
the analysis relies on the combinatorial characterization (in particular, the
half-integrality) of the extreme points of the F2F polytope. Represented as
bicolored multi-graphs, these extreme points are further decomposed into
simpler ""blossom-type"" structures for the large deviation analysis and counting

on the interior of Reissner-Nordstr\""om black holes, connecting the fixed
frequency picture to the physical space picture. Our main result gives the
existence, uniqueness and asymptotic completeness of finite energy scattering
states. The past and future scattering states are represented as suitable
traces of the solution $\psi$ on the bifurcate event and Cauchy horizons. The
heart of the proof is to show that after separation of variables one has
uniform boundedness of the reflection and transmission coefficients of the
resulting radial o.d.e. over all frequencies $\omega$ and $\ell$. This is
non-trivial because the natural $T$ conservation law is sign-indefinite in the
black hole interior. In the physical space picture, our results imply that the
Cauchy evolution from the event horizon to the Cauchy horizon is a Hilbert
space isomorphism, where the past (resp. future) Hilbert space is defined by
the finiteness of the degenerate $T$ energy fluxes on both components of the
event (resp. Cauchy) horizon. Finally, we prove that, in contrast to the above,
for a generic set of cosmological constants $\Lambda$, there is no analogous
finite $T$ energy scattering theory for either the linear wave equation or the
Klein-Gordon equation with conformal mass on the (anti-) de
Sitter-Reissner-Nordstr\""om interior.

out to be rich in deep and complex phenomena. For our model, a maze is a
countable strongly connected digraph called the board together with a proper
colouring of its edges (the edges leaving a vertex have distinct colours) and
two special vertices: the origin and the destination. A pointer or robot starts
at the origin of a maze and moves naturally between its vertices, according to
a finite or infinite sequence of specific instructions from the set of all
colours called an algorithm; if the robot is at a vertex for which there is no
out-edge of the colour indicated by the instruction, it remains at that vertex
and proceeds to execute the next instruction in the sequence. The central
object of study is the existence of algorithms that simultaneously solve, that
is guide the robot to visit the destination in, certain large sets of mazes.
  One of the most natural and interesting sets of mazes arises from the square
lattice $\Z^2$ viewed as a graph with arbitrarily many edges removed (each edge
corresponds to a pair of opposite directed edges), together with the suggestive
colouring that assigns to each directed edge the corresponding cardinal
direction. In this set-up, a research question of Leader and Spink from 2011,
which proved to be very profound, asks whether there exists an algorithm which
solves this set of mazes.
  In this paper we make progress towards this question. We consider the subset
of all such mazes which have arbitrarily many horizontal edges removed but only
finitely many vertical edges removed in consecutive columns, and construct an
algorithm which solves this subset of mazes.

introduces a bijection between unrestricted queries and a subset of $k$-ary

solved and can be used in more general contexts.
  This together constitutes an algorithm which is conceptually simpler than the

that simplifies the development of reactive programs by automatically
triggering program modules (event-handlers) in response to external events,
such as signals from the environment or messages from other programs. SignalGP
incorporates these concepts by extending existing tag-based referencing
techniques into an event-driven context. Both events and functions are labeled
with evolvable tags; when an event occurs, the function with the closest
matching tag is triggered. In this work, we apply SignalGP in the context of
linear GP. We demonstrate the value of the event-driven paradigm using two
distinct test problems (an environment coordination problem and a distributed
leader election problem) by comparing SignalGP to variants that are otherwise
identical, but must actively use sensors to process events or messages. In each
of these problems, rapid interaction with the environment or other agents is
critical for maximizing fitness. We also discuss ways in which SignalGP can be
generalized beyond our linear GP implementation.

as a sequence of growing cyclotron harmonics demonstrating wave breaking and
complex nonlinear interactions, being particularly pronounced in ion density
fluctuations at short wavelengths. At the same time, nonlinear evolution of

than $.499$. This remained essentially the state of the art until a 2015
breakthrough of Chattopadhyay and Zuckerman in which they gave an alternative

February 13, with successive formations of two circular ribbons at the same
location. The flare had two distinct phases of UV and EUV emissions with an
interval of about 270 s, of which the second peak was energetically more
important. The first episode was accompanied by the eruption of a mini-filament
and the fast elongation motion of a thin circular ribbon (CR1) along the
counterclockwise direction at a speed of about 220 km/s. Two elongated
spine-related ribbons were also observed, with the inner ribbon co-temporal
with CR1 and the remote brightenings forming ~20 s later. In the second
episode, another mini-filament erupted and formed a blowout jet. The second
circular ribbon and two spine-related ribbons showed similar elongation motions
with that during the first episode. The extrapolated 3D coronal magnetic fields
reveal the existence of a fan-spine topology, together with a quasi-separatrix
layer (QSL) halo surrounding the fan plane and another QSL structure outlining
the inner spine. We suggest that continuous null-point reconnection between the
filament and ambient open field occurs in each episode, leading to the
sequential opening of the filament and significant shifts of the fan plane
footprint. For the first time, we propose a compound eruption model of
circular-ribbon flares consisting of two sets of successively formed ribbons
and eruptions of multiple filaments in a fan-spine-type magnetic configuration.

structure refers to shape parts represented by cuboids and part relations

depicted, our goal is automatically recover a cuboid structure of the object
parts as well as their mutual relations. We develop a convolutional-recursive
auto-encoder comprised of structure parsing of a 2D image followed by structure
recovering of a cuboid hierarchy. The encoder is achieved by a multi-scale
convolutional network trained with the task of shape contour estimation,
thereby learning to discern object structures in various forms and scales. The
decoder fuses the features of the structure parsing network and the original
image, and recursively decodes a hierarchy of cuboids. Since the decoder
network is learned to recover part relations including connectivity and
symmetry explicitly, the plausibility and generality of part structure recovery
can be ensured. The two networks are jointly trained using the training data of
contour-mask and cuboid structure pairs. Such pairs are generated by rendering
stock 3D CAD models coming with part segmentation. Our method achieves
unprecedentedly faithful and detailed recovery of diverse 3D part structures

Hence, rough approximations of Helmholtz equations can significantly speed up
the iterative procedure. However, rough approximations will lead to instability

the modelling errors brought by the rough approximations. Modelling errors are
assumed to be some complex Gaussian mixture (CGM) random variables, and in

key to this problem is to trade accuracy for efficiency in an effective way,
i.e. reducing the computing cost while maintaining competitive performance. To
seek a good balance, previous efforts usually focus on optimizing the model
architectures. This paper explores an alternative approach, that is, to
reallocate the computation over a scale-time space. The basic idea is to
perform expensive detection sparsely and propagate the results across both
scales and time with substantially cheaper networks, by exploiting the strong
correlations among them. Specifically, we present a unified framework that
integrates detection, temporal propagation, and across-scale refinement on a
Scale-Time Lattice. On this framework, one can explore various strategies to
balance performance and cost. Taking advantage of this flexibility, we further
develop an adaptive scheme with the detector invoked on demand and thus obtain
improved tradeoff. On ImageNet VID dataset, the proposed method can achieve a
competitive mAP 79.6% at 20 fps, or 79.0% at 62 fps as a performance/speed

reduce this modulation by increasing the static magnetic field. The
longitudinal slanting field also mediates a spin-1/f-charge noise interaction,

confine massless Dirac fermions in graphene, which is also a central problem in
making electronic devices based on graphene. Here, we studied spatial
confinement, magnetic localization and their interactions on massless Dirac
fermions in an angled graphene wedge formed by two linear graphene p-n
boundaries with an angle 34. Using scanning tunneling microscopy, we visualized
quasibound states temporarily confined in the studied graphene wedge. Large
perpendicular magnetic fields condensed the massless Dirac fermions in the
graphene wedge into Landau levels (LLs). The spatial confinement of the wedge
affects the Landau quantization, which enables us to experimentally measure the
spatial extent of the wave functions of the LLs. The magnetic fields induce a
sudden and large increase in energy of the quasibound states because of a pi
Berry phase jump of the massless Dirac fermions in graphene. Such a behavior is
the hallmark of the Klein tunneling in graphene. Our experiment demonstrated
that the angled wedge is a unique system with the critical magnetic fields for
the pi Berry phase jump depending on distance from summit of the wedge.

is in box $i$ is $\pi_i(0)$. You then search in continuous time, observing box
$J_t$ at time $t$, and receiving a signal as you observe: if the box you are
observing does not contain the object, your signal is a Brownian motion, but if
it does contain the object your signal is a Brownian motion with positive drift
$\mu$. It is straightforward to derive the evolution of the posterior
distribution $\pi(t)$ for the location of the object. If $T$ denotes the first
time that one of the $\pi_j(t)$ reaches a desired threshold $1-\varepsilon$,
then the goal is to find a search policy $(J_t)_{t \geq 0}$ which minimizes the
mean of $T$. This problem was studied by Posner and Rumsey (1966) and by
Zigangirov (1966), who derive an expression for the mean time of a conjectured
optimal policy, which we call {\em follow the leader} (FTL); at all times,
observe the box with the highest posterior probability. Posner and Rumsey
assert without proof that this is optimal, and Zigangirov offers a proof that
if the prior distribution is uniform then FTL is optimal. In this paper, we
show that if the prior is not uniform, then FTL is {\em not} always optimal;
for uniform prior, the question remains open.

Binary matrices are a particular case which has received significant attention
for over thirty years, especially within the field of data mining. Dictionary
learning refers to a family of methods for learning overcomplete basis (also
called frames) in order to efficiently encode samples of a given type; this
area, now also about twenty years old, was mostly developed within the signal
processing field. In this work we propose two binary matrix factorization
methods based on a binary adaptation of the dictionary learning paradigm to
binary matrices. The proposed algorithms focus on speed and scalability; they
work with binary factors combined with bit-wise operations and a few auxiliary
integer ones. Furthermore, the methods are readily applicable to online binary
matrix factorization. Another important issue in matrix factorization is the
choice of rank for the factors; we address this model selection problem with an
efficient method based on the Minimum Description Length principle. Our
preliminary results show that the proposed methods are effective at producing
interpretable factorizations of various data types of different nature.

wavelength limit. Our results show that, if the thin-shell condition for the

screened outside the system irrespective of the configuration of the shells

that the fifth force can be comparable to the Newtonian gravitational force
inside the system. If the system is highly inhomogeneous, the chameleon field
cannot trace the potential minimum varying with the density and repeats being
kicked, climbing up and rolling down the potential even when the effective mass
of the chameleon field is sufficiently large in the system on average. One

approach for monitoring the environment. A current problem with performing
analyses of environmental recordings is interference from noise that can mask
sounds of interest. This makes detecting these sounds more difficult and can
require additional resources. While some work has been done to remove
stationary noise from environmental recordings, there has been little effort to
remove noise from non-stationary sources, such as rain, wind, engines, and
animal vocalisations that are not of interest.
  In this paper, we address the challenge of filtering noise from rain and
cicada choruses from recordings containing bird sound. We improve upon
previously established classification approaches using acoustic indices and Mel
Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) as acoustic features to detect these
noise sources, approaching the problem with the motivation of removing these
sounds. We investigate the use of acoustic indices, and machine learning
classifiers to find the most effective filters. The approach we use enables
users to set thresholds to increase or decrease the sensitivity of
classification, based on the prediction probability outputted by classifiers.
We also propose a novel approach to remove cicada choruses using band-pass
filters
  Our threshold-based approach (Random Forest with Acoustic Indices and Mel
Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)) for rain detection achieves an AUC of
0.9881 and is more accurate than existing approaches when set to the same
sensitivities. We also detect cicada choruses in our training set with 100%
accuracy using 10-folds cross validation. Our cicada filtering approach greatly
increased the median signal to noise ratios of affected recordings from 0.53
for unfiltered audio to 1.86 to audio filtered by both the cicada filter and a
stationary noise filter.

dependence of the overall bulk and shear moduli of an isotropized polycrystal

modulus decreases with grain size, the bulk modulus shows negligible dependence
on the grain diameter and is close to the bulk modulus of a single crystal. A
closed-form mean-field model of effective elastic properties for a bulk
nano-grained polycrystal with cubic grains, i.e. made of a material with cubic

complexity/latency advantages, spatially-coupled (SC) codes are among the most
attractive error-correcting codes for use in modern dense data storage systems.
SC codes are constructed by partitioning an underlying block code and coupling
the partitioned components. Here, we focus on circulant-based SC codes.
Recently, the optimal overlap (OO), circulant power optimizer (CPO) approach
was introduced to construct high performance SC codes for additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Flash channels. The OO stage operates on the
protograph of the SC code to derive the optimal partitioning that minimizes the
number of graphical objects that undermine the performance of SC codes under
iterative decoding. Then, the CPO optimizes the circulant powers to further
reduce this number. Since the nature of detrimental objects in the graph of a
code critically depends on the characteristics of the channel of interest,
extending the OO-CPO approach to construct SC codes for channels with intrinsic
memory is not a straightforward task. In this paper, we tackle one relevant
extension; we construct high performance SC codes for practical 1-D magnetic
recording channels, i.e., partial-response (PR) channels. Via combinatorial
techniques, we carefully build and solve the optimization problem of the OO
partitioning, focusing on the objects of interest in the case of PR channels.
Then, we customize the CPO to further reduce the number of these objects in the
graph of the code. SC codes designed using the proposed OO-CPO approach for PR
channels outperform prior state-of-the-art SC codes by up to around 3 orders of
magnitude in frame error rate (FER) and 1.1 dB in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
More intriguingly, our SC codes outperform structured block codes of the same
length and rate by up to around 1.8 orders of magnitude in FER and 0.4 dB in
SNR.

produce exact correct answers. When this condition fails, the second phase
builds upon the result of the first phase, possibly requiring exponential time

that the number of hot spots depends on the energy of the photon--target

production of $\rho^{0}$, $\mathrm{J/}\psi$, and $\Upsilon(1S)$ off protons, as
well as for coherent and incoherent photoproduction of $\rho^{0}$ off nuclear

dependence of dissociative production off protons as a function of the energy
of the interaction provides a further handle to search for saturation effects
at HERA, the LHC and future colliders. We also find that the coherent

rapidly migrate toward the central star. Planetesimals may continuously form
from pebbles over the age of the protoplanetary disk by yet uncertain
mechanisms. Meanwhile, large planetary embryos grow efficiently by accumulation
of leftover pebbles that are not incorporated in planetesimals. Although this
process, called pebble accretion, is offering a new promising pathway for
formation of giant planets' cores, architectures of planetary systems formed
through the process remain elusive. In the present paper, we perform
simulations of formation of planetary systems using a particle-based hybrid
code, to which we implement most of the key physical effects as precisely as
possible. We vary the size of a protoplanetary disk, the turbulent viscosity,
the pebble size, the planetesimal formation efficiency, and the initial mass
distribution of planetesimals. Our simulations show that planetesimals first
grow by mutual collisions if their initial size is the order of $100$ km or
less. Once planetesimals reach $\sim$ 1000 km in size, they efficiently grow by
pebble accretion. If pebble supply from the outer region continues for a long
period of time in a large protoplanetary disk, planetary embryos become massive
enough to commence runaway gas accretion, resulting in gas giant planets. Our
simulations suggest that planetary systems like ours form from protoplanetary
disks with moderately high turbulent viscosities. If the disk turbulent
viscosity is low enough, a planet opens up a gap in the gas disk and halts
accretion of pebbles even before the onset of runway gas accretion. Such a disk
produces a planetary system with several Neptune-size planets.

errors. To calibrate out residual biases due to the subtle interaction of
selection effects, Malmquist bias and anisotropic sky distribution, the
estimator is tested on mock catalogues generated from 16 independent
large-scale GiggleZ and SURFS simulations. The bulk flow of the local Universe
using the combined data set, corresponding to a scale size of 40 h$^{-1}$ Mpc,
is $288\pm24$ km s$^{-1}$ in the direction $(l,b)=(296\pm6^{\circ},
21\pm5^{\circ})$. This is the most accurate bulk flow measurement to date, and
the amplitude of the flow is consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM expectation for
similar size scales.

fractional derivatives in space and either 1D or 2D spatial domains. The use of
implicit Euler scheme in time and finite differences or finite elements in
space, leads to a sequence of dense large scale linear systems describing the
behavior of the solution over a time interval. We prove that the coefficient
matrices arising in the 1D context are rank structured and can be efficiently
represented using hierarchical formats ($\mathcal H$-matrices, HODLR).
Quantitative estimates for the rank of the off-diagonal blocks of these
matrices are presented. We analyze the use of HODLR arithmetic for solving the
1D case and we compare this strategy with existing methods that exploit the
Toeplitz-like structure to precondition the GMRES iteration. The numerical
tests demonstrate the convenience of the HODLR format when at least a
reasonably low number of time steps is needed. Finally, we explain how these
properties can be leveraged to design fast solvers for problems with 2D spatial
domains that can be reformulated as matrix equations. The experiments show that
the approach based on the use of rank-structured arithmetic is particularly
effective and outperforms current state of the art techniques.

recognize a revisited place when entering it from the opposite direction it was
first visited, even in the presence of extreme variations in appearance. This
capability is especially apparent during driving: a human driver can recognize
where they are when travelling in the reverse direction along a route for the
first time, without having to turn back and look. The difficulty of this
problem exceeds any addressed in past appearance- and viewpoint-invariant
visual place recognition (VPR) research, in part because large parts of the
scene are not commonly observable from opposite directions. Consequently, as
shown in this paper, the precision-recall performance of current
state-of-the-art viewpoint- and appearance-invariant VPR techniques is orders
of magnitude below what would be usable in a closed-loop system. Current
engineered solutions predominantly rely on panoramic camera or LIDAR sensing
setups; an eminently suitable engineering solution but one that is clearly very
different to how humans navigate, which also has implications for how naturally
humans could interact and communicate with the navigation system. In this paper
we develop a suite of novel semantic- and appearance-based techniques to enable
for the first time high performance place recognition in this challenging
scenario. We first propose a novel Local Semantic Tensor (LoST) descriptor of
images using the convolutional feature maps from a state-of-the-art dense
semantic segmentation network. Then, to verify the spatial semantic arrangement
of the top matching candidates, we develop a novel approach for mining
semantically-salient keypoint correspondences.

understanding structural relationships between the lattices of solutions of two
""nearby"" instances of stable matching. They also gave an application of their
work to finding a robust stable matching. However, the types of changes they
allowed in going from instance $A$ to $B$ were very restricted, namely any one
agent executes an upward shift. In this paper, we allow any one agent to
permute its preference list arbitrarily. Let $M_A$ and $M_B$ be the sets of
stable matchings of the resulting pair of instances $A$ and $B$, and let
$\mathcal{L}_A$ and $\mathcal{L}_B$ be the corresponding lattices of stable
matchings. We prove that the matchings in $M_A \cap M_B$ form a sublattice of
both $\mathcal{L}_A$ and $\mathcal{L}_B$ and those in $M_A \setminus M_B$ form
a join semi-sublattice of $\mathcal{L}_A$. These properties enable us to obtain
a polynomial time algorithm for not only finding a stable matching in $M_A \cap
M_B$, but also for obtaining the partial order, as promised by Birkhoff's
Representation Theorem, thereby enabling us to generate all matchings in this
sublattice. Our algorithm also helps solve a version of the robust stable
matching problem. We discuss another potential application, namely obtaining
new insights into the incentive compatibility properties of the Gale-Shapley
Deferred Acceptance Algorithm.

behaviour. We model a general analogue-digital system as a physical process

to the algorithm, generalising the notion of Turing. We develop a theoretical
framework for the specification and analysis of such systems that combines five
semantical notions: actual physical behaviour, measured behaviour, predicted
behaviour, computed behaviour and exceptional behaviour. Next, we consider the
more general and applicable situation of complex processes that exhibit several
distinct modes of physical behaviour. Thus, for their design, a set of
mathematical models may be needed, each model having its own domain of
application and representing a particular mode of behaviour or operation of
physical reality with its own physical oracle. The models may be of disparate
kinds and, furthermore, not all physical modes may even have a reliable model.
We address the questions: How do we specify algorithms and software that
monitor or govern a complex physical situation with many physical modes? How do
we specify a portfolio of modes, and the computational problem of transitioning
from using one mode to another mode as physical behaviour changes? We propose a
general definition of an analogue-digital system with modes, and show how any
diverse set of modes, with or without models, can be bound together, and how
the transitions between modes can be determined, by constructing a data type
and mode selection functions. We illustrate the ideas of physical modes and our
theory by reflecting on simple examples, including driverless racing cars.

classical approach involves selecting a smaller set of relevant sensor signals

However, this fails to address two prominent problems: (1) sensors are
susceptible to failure when exposed to extreme conditions over a long periods
of time; (2) sensors are electrical devices that can be affected by noise or
electrical interference. Using the failed and noisy sensor signals as inputs
largely reduce the prediction accuracy. To tackle this problem, it is
advantageous to use the information from all sensor signals, so that the

  and presentation of causal estimates",,,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Mendelian randomization uses genetic variants to make causal inferences about
a modifiable exposure. Subject to a genetic variant satisfying the instrumental
variable assumptions, an association between the variant and outcome implies a
causal effect of the exposure on the outcome. Complications arise with a binary
exposure that is a dichotomization of a continuous risk factor (for example,
hypertension is a dichotomization of blood pressure). This can lead to
violation of the exclusion restriction assumption: the genetic variant can
influence the outcome via the continuous risk factor even if the binary
exposure does not change. Provided the instrumental variable assumptions are
satisfied for the underlying continuous risk factor, causal inferences for the
binary exposure are valid for the continuous risk factor. Causal estimates for
the binary exposure assume the causal effect is a stepwise function at the
point of dichotomization. Even then, estimation requires further parametric
assumptions. Under monotonicity, the causal estimate represents the average
causal effect in `compliers', individuals for whom the binary exposure would be
present if they have the genetic variant and absent otherwise. Unlike in
randomized trials, genetic compliers are unlikely to be a large or
representative subgroup of the population. Under homogeneity, the causal effect
of the exposure on the outcome is assumed constant in all individuals; often an
unrealistic assumption. We here provide methods for causal estimation with a
binary exposure (although subject to all the above caveats). Mendelian
randomization investigations with a dichotomized binary exposure should be
conceptualized in terms of an underlying continuous variable.

properties of molecules found natively within cells. By applying spectral
decomposition on the acquired autofluorescence spectra, we are able to further
discern the relative contributions of the different molecules, namely flavin
adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NADH). This is then quantifiable as redox ratios (RR) that represent the
extent of oxidation to reduction based upon the optically measured quantities
of FAD and NADH. Results show that RR is significantly higher for lower
confluencies ($\leq$50$\%$), which we attribute to the different metabolic
requirements as cells switch from individual survival to concerted
proliferation. We validate this relationship through bio-chemical assays and
autofluorescence imaging, and further confirmed through a live-dead study that

article, a study is presented on the zero-day threats for IoT networks and a
context graph-based framework is presented to provide a strategy for mitigating

are envisioned to be at microscale, the available MC testbeds reported in the
literature so far are mostly at macroscale. This may partially be due to the
fact that controlling an MC system at microscale is quite challenging. To link
the macroworld to the microworld, we propose a biological signal conversion
interface that can also be seen as a microscale modulator. This interface
translates an optical signal, which can be easily controlled using a
light-emitting diode (LED), into a chemical signal by changing the pH of the
environment. The modulator is realized using \textit{Escherichia coli} bacteria
that express the light-driven proton pump gloeorhodopsin from
\textit{Gloeobacter violaceus}. Upon inducing external light stimuli, these
bacteria can locally change their surrounding pH level by exporting protons
into the environment. Based on measurement data from a testbed, we develop an
analytical model for the induced chemical signal as a function of the applied
optical signal. Finally, using a pH sensor as detector, we show for an example
scenario that the proposed setup is able to successfully convert an optical
signal representing a sequence of binary symbols into a chemical signal with a
bit rate of $1$~bit/min.

optimization problems that are very challenging to solve. We propose optimal

the optimal solutions require statistical information of the channel states,
while the near-optimal solutions do not require such information and perform
well in practice. Furthermore, to ensure fairness among E-Rs, we propose two
fair policies, namely Max- Min Fair policy and quality-of-service-aware
Proportional Fair policy. MMF policy targets maximizing the minimum received

NIHAO high resolution galaxies to separate the stars into multiple components.
We exemplify this method using a simulated Milky Way analogue, whose stellar
component hosts: thin and thick discs, classical and pseudo bulges, and a
stellar halo. The properties of these stellar structures are in good agreement
with observational expectations in terms of sizes, shapes and rotational
support. Interestingly, the two kinematic discs show surface mass density
profiles more centrally concentrated than exponentials, while the bulges and
the stellar halo are purely exponential. We trace back in time the Lagrangian
mass of each component separately to study their formation history. Between z~3
and the end of halo virialization, z~1.3, all components lose a fraction of
their angular momentum. The classical bulge loses the most (~95%) and the thin
disc the least (~60%). Both bulges formed their stars in-situ at high redshift,
while the thin disc formed ~98% in-situ, but with a constant
SFR~1.5M$_{\rm\odot}$/yr$^{\rm-1}$ over the last ~11 Gyr. Accreted stars (6% of
total stellar mass) are mainly incorporated to the thick disc or the stellar
halo, which formed ex-situ 8% and 45% of their respective masses. Our analysis

is a collective excitation that arises in a system involving spontaneous
breaking of a continuous symmetry, along with a gapless Nambu-Goldstone mode.
It has been known in the previous studies that a pure amplitude MG mode emerges
in superconductors if the dispersion of fermions exhibits the particle-hole
(p-h) symmetry. However, clear understanding of the relation between the
symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the MG modes has not been reached. Here we
reveal the fundamental connection between the discrete symmetry of the
Hamiltonian and the emergence of pure amplitude MG modes. To this end, we
introduce nontrivial charge-conjugation ($\mathcal C$), parity ($\mathcal P$),
and time-reversal ($\mathcal T$) operations that involve the swapping of pairs
of wave vectors symmetrical with respect to the Fermi surface. The product of
$\mathcal{CPT}$ (or its permutations) represents an exact symmetry analogous to
the CPT theorem in the relativistic field theory. It is shown that a fermionic
Hamiltonian with a p-h symmetric dispersion exhibits the discrete symmetries
under $\mathcal C$, $\mathcal P$, $\mathcal T$, and $\mathcal{CPT}$. We find
that in the superconducting ground state, $\mathcal T$ and $\mathcal P$ are
spontaneously broken simultaneously with the U(1) symmetry. Moreover, we
rigorously show that amplitude and phase fluctuations of the gap function are
uncoupled due to the unbroken $\mathcal C$. In the normal phase, the MG and NG
modes become degenerate, and they have opposite parity under $\mathcal T$.
Therefore, we conclude that the lifting of the degeneracy in the
superconducting phase and the resulting emergence of the pure amplitude MG mode
can be identified as a consequence of the the spontaneous breaking of $\mathcal
T$ symmetry but not of $\mathcal P$ or U(1).

in each case five different form factors. In particular, for each term beyond
the standard model, we find some constraints on the strength and phase of the

analogous semi-leptonic decays of $B$. Our analysis involves some dimensionless
quantities, substantially independent of the form factor, but which, owing to
the constraints, turn out to be strongly sensitive to the kind of non-standard
interaction. We also introduce a criterion thanks to which one can discriminate
among the various new physics terms: the left-handed current and the
two-higgs-doublet model appear privileged, with a neat preference for the
former interaction. Lastly, we suggest a differential observable that could, in
principle, help to distinguish between the two cases.

potential ferrotoroidic LiFeSi2O6 compound across structural and magnetic phase
transitions. The structural transition (TS)is around 220K and the paramagnetic
to antiferromagnetic transition (TN) is around 18K. The lattice parameters
exhibit unusual temperature dependence and based on its behaviour, the exper-
imental results can be divided into 3 regions.In region I (300K to 240K), the
cell parameters are mainly governed by mere thermal effect. As the compound
enters region II (below 240K to 50K), the lattice parameters show non linear
behaviour. In this region, the exchange pathways that lead to the magnetic
interactions within and between the Fe-Fe chains do not show significant
response.The region III (below 50K) is dominated by the magnetic contribution
where we observe setting up of intra and inter-chain magnetic interaction. This
behaviour is unlike other low dimensional com- pounds like Ca3Co2O6, Sr3NiRhO6,
MnTiO3 etc. thereby suggesting the magnetism in LiFeSi2O6 is of three
dimensional nature. The present results will be helpful in understanding the
evolution of the spin rings that give rise to net toroidal moment and hence its
multiferroic behaviour.

complex warm ($>$15--60 K) filamentary/clumpy structures with the sizes from a

different density/velocity components that originated from the turbulent

not correspond to a simple extension of the line-width-size relation (i.e.,
Larson'{}s law), and thus the actual origin remains to be studied. The

detecting small-scale turbulent motions in dense cores and to investigate

Montonen-Sarker-Trullinger-Bishop model. The MSTB model is in fact a
one-parametric family of relativistic scalar field theories living in a
one-time one-space Minkowski space-time which encompasses two coupled scalar
fields. Between the static solutions of the model two kinds of topological
kinks are distinguished in a precise range of the family parameter. In that
regime there exists one unstable kink exhibiting only one non-null component of
the scalar field. Another type of topological kink solutions, stable in this
case, includes two different kinks for which the two-components of the scalar
field are non-null. Both one-component and two-component topological kinks are
accompanied by their antikink partner. The decay of disintegration of the
unstable kink to one of the stable pair plus radiation is numerically computed.
The pair of stable two-component kinks living respectively on upper and lower
half-ellipses in field space belong to identical topological sectors in
configuration space and provides an ideal playground to address several
scattering events involving one kink and either its own antikinks or either the
antikink of the other stable kink of the pair. By means of a numerical
computation procedure we shall find and describe interesting physical
phenomena. Bion (kink-antikink oscillations) formation, kink reflection,
kink-antikink annihilation, kink transmutation and resonances are examples of
these type of events. The appearance of these special phenomena emerging in
kink-antikink scattering configurations depends critically on the initial
collision velocity and the chosen value of the coupling constant parametrizing

effect. The latter has been predicted to arise for a Coulomb-blockaded
mesoscopic topological superconductor (Majorana box), where at least three
normal leads are tunnel-coupled to different Majorana zero modes on the box.
The Majorana states represent a quantum impurity spin that is partially
screened due to cotunneling processes between leads, with a stable non-Fermi
liquid ground state. Our theory studies a generalization where (i) Majorana
states are replaced by topologically protected parafermionic zero modes, (ii)
charging effects again define a spin-like quantum impurity on the resulting
parafermion box, and (iii) normal leads are substituted by fractional edge
states. In this multi-terminal problem, different fractional edge leads couple
only via the parafermion box. We show that although the linear conductance
tensor exhibits similar behavior as in the Majorana case, both at weak and
strong coupling, our parafermionic generalization is actually not a Kondo
problem but defines a rich new class of quantum impurity problems. At the
strong-coupling fixed point, a current injected through a reference lead will
be isotropically partitioned into outgoing currents in all other leads,
together with a universal negative current scattered into the reference lead.
The device can thus be operated as current extractor, where the current
partitioning is noiseless at the fixed point. We describe a fractional quantum
Hall setup proximitized by superconductors and ferromagnets, which could allow
for an experimental realization in the near future.

monomers that are distributed randomly along the polymer chain. The interaction
between charges is assumed to be given by the Debye-Huckel potential. We show
that the size of the PA is determined by an interplay between electrostatic
interactions, giving rise to the polyelectrolyte (PE) effect due to net charge
per monomer ($\sigma$), and an effective attractive PA interaction due to
charge fluctuations, $\delta \sigma$. The interplay between these terms gives
rise to non-monotonic dependence of the radius of gyration, $R_g$ on the
inverse Debye length, $\kappa$ when PA effects are important (${\frac{\delta
\sigma}{\sigma}} > 1$). In the opposite limit, $R_g$ decreases monotonically
with increasing $\kappa$. Simulations of PA chains, using a charged bead-spring
model, further corroborates our theoretical predictions. The simulations
unambiguously show that conformational heterogeneity manifests itself among
sequences that have identical PA parameters. A clear implication is that the
phases of PA sequences, and by inference IDPs, cannot be determined using only
the bare PA parameters ($\sigma$ and $\delta \sigma$). The theory is used to
calculate the changes in $R_g$ on $N$, the number of residues for a set of
Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs). For a certain class of IDPs, with $N$
between 24 to 441, the size grows as $R_g \sim N^{0.6}$, which agrees with data

the molecular level. Here we follow the formation of the first monolayer of
water at the (001) surfaces of Sr$_{n+1}$Ru$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ ($n$ = 1, 2) using
low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, and density functional theory. These layered perovskites cleave
between neighbouring SrO planes, yielding almost ideal, rocksalt-like surfaces.
An adsorbed monomer dissociates and forms a pair of hydroxide ions. The OH
stemming from the original molecule stays trapped at Sr-Sr bridge positions,
circling the surface OH with a measured activation energy of 187 $\pm$ 10 meV.
At higher coverage, dimers of dissociated water assemble into one-dimensional
chains and form a percolating network where water adsorbs molecularly in the
gaps. Our work shows the limitations of applying surface chemistry concepts
derived for binary rocksalt oxides to perovskites.

jointly estimates camera poses and sparse scene geometry by minimizing
photometric and IMU measurement errors in a combined energy functional. The
visual part of the system performs a bundle-adjustment like optimization on a
sparse set of points, but unlike key-point based systems it directly minimizes
a photometric error. This makes it possible for the system to track not only
corners, but any pixels with large enough intensity gradients. IMU information
is accumulated between several frames using measurement preintegration, and is
inserted into the optimization as an additional constraint between keyframes.
We explicitly include scale and gravity direction into our model and jointly
optimize them together with other variables such as poses. As the scale is
often not immediately observable using IMU data this allows us to initialize
our visual-inertial system with an arbitrary scale instead of having to delay
the initialization until everything is observable. We perform partial
marginalization of old variables so that updates can be computed in a
reasonable time. In order to keep the system consistent we propose a novel
strategy which we call ""dynamic marginalization"". This technique allows us to
use partial marginalization even in cases where the initial scale estimate is
far from the optimum. We evaluate our method on the challenging EuRoC dataset,
showing that VI-DSO outperforms the state of the art.

well-coupled throughout the reconnection region resembling the single-fluid

sets of the f-divergence ball type, a pair of uncertainty sets of the density

  estimation of particle size distribution using multi-objective optimisation","20 pages, 3 figures, manuscript to be submitted to the Journal of
  Chemical Engineering Science",,,,"physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The in situ measurement of the particle size distribution (PSD) of a
suspension of particles presents huge challenges. Various effects from the
process could introduce noise to the data from which the PSD is estimated. This
in turn could lead to the occurrence of artificial peaks in the estimated PSD.
Limitations in the models used in the PSD estimation could also lead to the
occurrence of these artificial peaks. This could pose a significant challenge
to in situ monitoring of particulate processes, as there will be no independent
estimate of the PSD to allow a discrimination of the artificial peaks to be
carried out.
  Here, we present an algorithm which is capable of discriminating between
artificial and true peaks in PSD estimates based on fusion of multiple data
streams. In this case, chord length distribution and laser diffraction data
have been used. The data fusion is done by means of multi-objective
optimisation using the weighted sum approach. The algorithm is applied to two
different particle suspensions. The estimated PSDs from the algorithm are
compared with offline estimates of PSD from the Malvern Mastersizer and
Morphologi G3. The results show that the algorithm is capable of eliminating an
artificial peak in a PSD estimate when this artificial peak is sufficiently
displaced from the true peak. However, when the artificial peak is too close to
the true peak, it is only suppressed but not completely eliminated.

half a century and is still unresolved. Most of the confusion is caused by the
absence of any prominent counterparts of these structures in the southern
Galactic hemisphere (SGH). This has also led to doubts over the claimed
connection between the NPS and Fermi Bubbles (FBs). I show in this paper, that
such asymmetries of NPS and Loop-I in both X-rays and $\gamma$-rays can be
easily produced if the circumgalactic medium (CGM) density in the southern
hemisphere is only smaller by $\approx 20\%$ than the northern counterpart in
case of a star formation driven wind scenario. The required mechanical
luminosity, $\mathcal{L} \approx 4-5\times 10^{40} $ erg s$^{-1}$ (reduces to
$\approx 0.3$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ including the non-thermal pressure) and the
age of the FBs, $t_{\rm age} \approx 28$ Myr, are consistent with previous
estimations in case of a star formation driven wind scenario. One of the main
reasons for the asymmetry is the projection effects at the Solar location. Such
a proposition is also consistent with the fact that the southern FB is $\approx
5^\circ$ bigger than the northern one. The results, therefore, indicate towards
a possibility for a common origin of the NPS, Loop-I and FBs from the Galactic
centre (GC). I also estimate the average sky brightness in X-ray towards the
south Galactic pole and North Galactic pole in the ROSAT-R67 band and find that
the error in average brightness is far too large to have any estimation of the
deficiency in the southern hemisphere.

Experiments show that external circuits in general heavily interact with the

order to be able to design suitable networks, e.g., for plasma processing
systems. For a complete understanding of the underlying physics of this
coupling, a nonlinear simulation approach which considers both the plasma and
the circuit dynamics can provide useful insights. In this work, the coupling of
an equivalent circuit plasma model and an electric external circuit composed of
lumped elements is discussed. The plasma model itself is self-consistent in the
sense that the plasma density and the electron temperature is calculated from
the absorbed power based on a global plasma chemistry model. The approach
encompasses all elements present in real plasma systems, i.e., the discharge
itself, the matching network, the power generator as well as stray loss
elements. While the main results of this work is the conceptual approach
itself, at the example of a single-frequency capacitively coupled discharge its
applicability is demonstrated. It is shown that it provides an effective and
efficient way to analyze and understand the nonlinear dynamics of real plasma

2017 May 15 was observed using six antennas of the Very Long Baseline Array
(VLBA). The shadow of Palma crossed the VLBA station at Brewster, Washington.
Owing to the wavelength used, and the size and the distance of the asteroid, a
diffraction pattern in the Fraunhofer regime was observed. The measurement
retrieves both the amplitude and the phase of the diffracted electromagnetic
wave. This is the first astronomical measurement of the phase shift caused by
diffraction. The maximum phase shift is sensitive to the effective diameter of
the asteroid. The bright spot at the shadow's center, the so called
Arago--Poisson spot, is clearly detected in the amplitude time-series, and its
strength is a good indicator of the closest angular distance between the center
of the asteroid and the radio source. A sample of random shapes constructed
using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm suggests that the silhouette of
Palma deviates from a perfect circle by 26+-13%. The best-fitting random shapes
resemble each other, and we suggest their average approximates the shape of the
silhouette at the time of the occultation. The effective diameter obtained for
Palma, 192.1+-4.8 km, is in excellent agreement with recent estimates from
thermal modeling of mid-infrared photometry. Finally, our computations show
that because of the high positional accuracy, a single radio interferometric
occultation measurement can reduce the long-term ephemeris uncertainty by an
order of magnitude.

Nevertheless, a wide range of SEDs would predict observable H I Ly$\alpha$

uncertain coefficients. We propose two formulations, one where the solution is
a deterministic control optimizing the mean objective, and a formulation aiming
at stochastic controls that share the same sparsity structure. In both
formulations, regions where the controls do not vanish can be interpreted as
optimal locations for placing control devices. In this paper, we focus on
linear PDEs with linearly entering uncertain parameters. Under these
assumptions, the deterministic formulation reduces to a problem with known
structure, and thus we mainly focus on the stochastic control formulation.
Here, shared sparsity is achieved by incorporating the $L^1$-norm of the mean
of the pointwise squared controls in the objective. We reformulate the problem
using a norm reweighting function that is defined over physical space only and
thus helps to avoid approximation of the random space using samples or
quadrature. We show that a fixed point algorithm applied to the norm
reweighting formulation leads to a variant of the well-studied iterative
reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm, and we propose a novel
preconditioned Newton-conjugate gradient method to speed up the IRLS algorithm.
We combine our algorithms with low-rank operator approximations, for which we
provide estimates of the truncation error. We carefully examine the
computational complexity of the resulting algorithms. The sparsity structure of
the optimal controls and the performance of the solution algorithms are studied
numerically using control problems governed by the Laplace and Helmholtz
equations. In these experiments the Newton variant clearly outperforms the IRLS
method.

face-on spiral feature around the systemic velocity. This is the first
convincing detection of a spiral morphology in an O-rich wind. Based on the
offsets of the centers of the two bi-conical wind hemispheres, we deduce the
position angle of the inclination axis to be ~150 deg measured counterclockwise
from north. Based on the velocity width of the spiral signature we estimate the
inclination angle of the system to be between 4 deg and 18 deg. The central
emission zone exhibits a morphology that resembles simulations modelling the
spiral-inducing wind-Roche-lobe-overflow mechanism. Though the spiral may be a
(companion-induced) density enhancement in the stellar outflow, the extremely
narrow width of the spiral signature in velocity space suggests that it may be
a hydrodynamical perturbation in a face-on differentially rotating disk. The

bowing machine and analyzed using a Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD)
cochlear model. A double-slip sound is investigated. Here the sawtooth motion
of normal bowing is basically present, but within each period the bow hair
tears off the strings once more within the period, resulting in a blurred
sound. This additional intermediate slip appears around the middle of each
period and drifts temporally around while the sound progresses. When the
double-slip is perfectly in the middle of one period the sound is that of a
regular sawtooth motion. If not, two periodicities are present around double
the fundamental periodicity, making the sound arbitrary. Analyzing the sound
with a Wavelet-transform, the expected double-peak of two periodicities around
the second partial cannot be found. Analyzing the tone with a cochlear FDTD
model including the transfer of mechanical energy into spikes, the doubling and
even more complex behaviour is perfectly represented in the Interspike Interval
(ISI) of two adjacent spikes. This cochlear spike representation fits perfectly
to an amplitude peak detection algorithm, tracking the precise time point of
the double-slip within the fundamental period. Therefore the ear is able to
detect the double-slip motion right at the transition from the basilar membrane
motion into electrical spikes.

fantasy, and the collective imagination. However, a real device that could hide
an object from sight in visible light from absolutely any viewpoint would be
extremely challenging to build. The main obstacle to creating such a cloak is
the coupling of the electromagnetic components of light, which would
necessitate the use of complex materials with specific permittivity and
permeability tensors. Previous cloaking solutions have involved circumventing
this obstacle by functioning either in static (or quasi-static) fields where
these electromagnetic components are uncoupled or in diffusive light scattering
media where complex materials are not required. In this paper, we report
concealing a large-scale spherical object from human sight from three
orthogonal directions. We achieve this result by developing a three-dimensional
(3D) homogeneous polyhedral transformation and a spatially invariant refractive
index discretization that considerably reduce the coupling of the
electromagnetic components of visible light. This approach allows for a major
simplification in the design of 3D invisibility cloaks, which can now be
created at a large scale using homogeneous and isotropic materials.

effectiveness of transportation policies. To be effective, a policy has to
consider a broad range of elements, such as pollution emission, traffic flow,
and human mobility. Due to the complexity and variability of these elements in
the urban area, to produce effective policies remains a very challenging task.
With the introduction of the smart city paradigm, a widely available amount of
data can be generated in the urban spaces. Such data can be a fundamental
source of knowledge to improve policies because they can reflect the
sustainability issues underlying the city. In this context, we propose an
approach to exploit urban positioning data based on stigmergy, a bio-inspired
mechanism providing scalar and temporal aggregation of samples. By employing
stigmergy, samples in proximity with each other are aggregated into a
functional structure called trail. The trail summarizes relevant dynamics in
data and allows matching them, providing a measure of their similarity.
Moreover, this mechanism can be specialized to unfold specific dynamics.
Specifically, we identify high-density urban areas (i.e hotspots), analyze
their activity over time, and unfold anomalies. Moreover, by matching activity
patterns, a continuous measure of the dissimilarity with respect to the typical
activity pattern is provided. This measure can be used by policy makers to
evaluate the effect of policies and change them dynamically. As a case study,
we analyze taxi trip data gathered in Manhattan from 2013 to 2015.

leads to the nucleation of quantized vortices. We explain this by indicating
that the effective rotation with the vortex nucleation results from the
effective magnetic flux induced by the gauge potential, which is essentially
different from the previous scheme of creating vortices by synthetic magnetic
fields. In the weakly interacting regime, symmetrically placed domains
separated by vortex lines as well as half-integer giant vortices are
discovered. With relatively strong interatomic interaction, we predict a

contrast to the familiar Abrikosov vortex lattice. The developed way of

investigate the vertical distributions of particle size and mass density of
mineral clouds in super-Earths using a microphysical model that takes into
account the vertical transport and growth of cloud particles in a
self-consistent manner. We demonstrate that the vertical profiles of mineral
clouds significantly vary with the concentration of cloud condensation nuclei
and atmospheric metallicity. We find that the height of the cloud top increases
with increasing metallicity as long as the metallicity is lower than a
threshold. If the metallicity is larger than the threshold, the cloud-top
height no longer increases appreciably with metallicity because coalescence
yields larger particles of higher settling velocities. We apply our cloud model
to GJ1214 b and GJ436 b for which recent transmission observations suggest the
presence of high-altitude opaque clouds. For GJ436 b, we show that KCl
particles can ascend high enough to explain the observation. For GJ1214 b, by
contrast, the height of KCl clouds predicted from our model is too low to
explain its flat transmission spectrum. Clouds made of highly porous KCl
particles could explain the observations if the atmosphere is highly
metal-rich, and hence the particle microstructure might be a key to interpret
the flat spectrum of GJ1214 b.

that characterizes all executions of a protocol that extend a given scenario.
In effect, it computes a strongest security goal the protocol achieves in that

enrich-by-need protocol analysis.
  In this paper, we describe how to analyze protocols using the Diffie-Hellman
mechanism for key agreement (DH) in the enrich-by-need style. DH, while
widespread, has been challenging for protocol analysis because of its algebraic
structure. DH essentially involves fields and cyclic groups, which do not fit
the standard foundational framework of symbolic protocol analysis. By contrast,
we justify our analysis via an algebraically natural model.
  This foundation makes the extended CPSA implementation reliable. Moreover, it
provides informative and efficient results.

as Fe$^{3+}$ and Fe$^{5+}$, to a paramagnetic-metallic phase at temperatures
above 210 K, with Fe$^{4+}$ present. To describe it, we propose a microscopic
effective model with two interpenetrating sublattices of Fe$^{(4-\delta)+}$ and
Fe$^{(4+\delta)+}$, respectively, being $\delta$ the Fe-charge
disproportionation. We include all $3d$-Fe orbitals: $t_{2g}$ localized
orbitals, with spin 3/2 and magnetically coupled, plus two degenerate itinerant
$e_g$ orbitals with local and nearest-neighbor (NN) electron correlations, and
hopping between NN $e_g$ orbitals of the same symmetry. Allub and Alascio
previously proposed a model to describe the phase transition in
LaCu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$ from a paramagnetic-metal to an
antiferromagnetic-insulator, induced by temperature or pressure, involving
charge transfer between Fe and Cu ions, in contrast to Fe-charge
disproportionation. With the model proposed for CaCu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$,
modified to account for this difference between the two compounds, the density
of states of the itinerant Fe orbitals was obtained, using Green's functions
methods. The phase diagram for CaCu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$ was calculated, including
phases exhibiting Fe-charge disproportionation, where the two eg orbitals in
each site are symmetrically occupied, as well as novel phases exhibiting local
orbital selectivity/asymmetric occupation of $e_g$ orbitals. Both kinds of
phases may exhibit paramagnetism and ferromagnetism. We determined the model
parameters which best describe the phase transition observed in
CaCu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$, and found other phases at different parameter ranges,

raw texts for enhancing model performances. Traditional self-training methods
depend on heuristics such as model confidence for instance selection, the
manual adjustment of which can be expensive. To address these challenges, we
propose a deep reinforcement learning method to learn the self-training

our model automatically learns an optimal policy for instance selection.
Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the baseline solutions

the qubit circuit model, which is characterized by a few simple properties:
each computational gate is a reversible transformation in a connected matrix
group; single wires carry quantum bits, i.e. states of a three-dimensional
Bloch ball; states on two or more wires are uniquely determined by local
measurement statistics and their correlations. In this paper, we ask whether
other types of computation are possible if we relax one of those
characteristics (and keep all others), namely, if we allow wires to be
described by d-dimensional Bloch balls, where d is different from three.
Theories of this kind have previously been proposed as possible generalizations
of quantum physics, and it has been conjectured that some of them allow for
interesting multipartite reversible transformations that cannot be realized
within quantum theory. However, here we show that all such potential
beyond-quantum models of computation are trivial: if d is not three, then the
set of reversible transformations consists entirely of single-bit gates, and
not even classical computation is possible. In this sense, qubit quantum
computation is an island in theoryspace.

that increasingly occupy our world. However, the complexity of many of these
systems - often systems-of-systems - poses accountability challenges. A key
reason for this is because the details and nature of the information flows that
interconnect and drive systems, which often occur across technical and
organisational boundaries, tend to be invisible or opaque. This paper argues
that data provenance methods show much promise as a technical means for
increasing the transparency of these interconnected systems. Specifically,
given the concerns regarding ever-increasing levels of automated and
algorithmic decision-making, and so-called 'algorithmic systems' in general, we
propose decision provenance as a concept showing much promise. Decision
provenance entails using provenance methods to provide information exposing
decision pipelines: chains of inputs to, the nature of, and the flow-on effects
from the decisions and actions taken (at design and run-time) throughout
systems. This paper introduces the concept of decision provenance, and takes an
interdisciplinary (tech-legal) exploration into its potential for assisting
accountability in algorithmic systems. We argue that decision provenance can
help facilitate oversight, audit, compliance, risk mitigation, and user
empowerment, and we also indicate the implementation considerations and areas
for research necessary for realising its vision. More generally, we make the
case that considerations of data flow, and systems more broadly, are important
to discussions of accountability, and complement the considerable attention
already given to algorithmic specifics.

this is not due to their formation but due to differences in X-ray luminosity.
It has also been proposed that the truncation of the Be star's circumstellar
disc is dependent on the mass of the compact object. Hence, Be star discs in
black hole binaries are smaller. Since accretion onto the compact object from
the Be star's disc is what powers the X-ray luminosity, a smaller disc in black
hole systems leads to a lower luminosity. In this paper, simulations are
performed with a range of eccentricities and compact object mass. The disc's
size and density are shown to be dependent on both quantities. Mass capture
and, in turn, X-ray luminosity are heavily dependent on the size and density of
the disc. Be/black hole binaries are expected to be up to ~10 times fainter
than Be/neutron star binaries when both systems have the same eccentricity and
can be 100 times fainter when comparing systems with different eccentricity.

instances of the compactness of $\mathcal{L}_{\kappa,\kappa}$. Using this
equivalence we show that if any $\kappa$-complete filter on $\lambda$ can be
extended to a $\kappa$-complete ultrafilter and $\lambda^{<\kappa} = \lambda$
then $\square(\mu)$ fails for all regular $\mu\in[\kappa,2^\lambda]$. As an
application, we improve the lower bound for the consistency strength of
$\kappa$-compactness, a case which was explicitly considered by Mitchell.

Voronoi cell of the root lattice is constructed as the dual of the root
polytope which turns out to be the union of Delone cells. It is shown that the
Delone cells centered at the origin of the root lattice An are the polytopes of
the fundamental weights w1, w2, ..., wn and the Delone cells of the root
lattice Dn are the polytopes obtained from the weights w1, wn-1, wn. A simple
mechanism explains the tessellation of the root lattice by Delone cells. We
prove that the (n-1)-facet of the Voronoi cell of the root lattice An is
(n-1)-dimensional rhombohedron and similarly the (n-1) -facet of the Voronoi
cell of the root lattice Dn is a dipyramid with a base of (n-2)-cube. Volume of
the Voronoi cell is calculated via its (n-1) -facet which in turn can be
obtained from the fundamental simplex. Tessellations of the root lattice with
the Voronoi and Delone cells are explained by giving examples from lower

real-world applications. Despite recent great progress in image/video
classification, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) cannot yet cater to graphs
well because of graphical non-Euclidean topology. In this work, we propose a
walk-steered convolutional (WSC) network to assemble the essential success of
standard convolutional neural networks as well as the powerful representation
ability of random walk. Instead of deterministic neighbor searching used in
previous graphical CNNs, we construct multi-scale walk fields (a.k.a. local
receptive fields) with random walk paths to depict subgraph structures and
advocate graph scalability. To express the internal variations of a walk field,
Gaussian mixture models are introduced to encode principal components of walk
paths therein. As an analogy to a standard convolution kernel on image,
Gaussian models implicitly coordinate those unordered vertices/nodes and edges
in a local receptive field after projecting to the gradient space of Gaussian
parameters. We further stack graph coarsening upon Gaussian encoding by using
dynamic clustering, such that high-level semantics of graph can be well learned
like the conventional pooling on image. The experimental results on several
public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed WSC method over
many state-of-the-arts for graph classification.

  Conservative Revolutionary (World Scientific)",,,,"gr-qc astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  I describe a heuristic model where MOND dynamics emerge in a universe viewed
as a nearly spherical brane embedded in a higher-dimensional flat space. The
brane, described by $\xi(\Omega)$, is of density $\sigma$ ($\xi$ and $\Omega$
are the radial and angular coordinates in the embedding space). The brane and
matter -- confined to the brane and of density $\rho(\Omega)\ll\sigma$ -- are
coupled to a potential $\varepsilon(\xi)$. I restrict myself to shallow
perturbations, $\xi(\Omega)=\ell_0+\zeta(\Omega)$, $|\zeta|\ll\ell_0$. A
balanced brane implies $\hat a_0\equiv\varepsilon'(\ell_0)\sim T/\sigma\ell_0$,
$T$ is the brane tension, yielding for the velocity of small brane
perturbations $c^2\sim T/\sigma\sim \ell_0\hat a_0$. But, $\hat a_0$ plays the
role of the MOND acceleration constant in local gravitational dynamics; so
$\hat a_0\sim c^2/\ell_0$. What we, in the brane, perceive as the gravitational
potential is $\phi\equiv\varepsilon[\xi(\Omega)]\approx \phi_0+\hat a_0\zeta$.
Aspects of MOND that may emerge naturally as geometrical properties are: a. The
special role of acceleration in MOND, and why it is an acceleration, $a_0$,
that marks the transition from the standard dynamics much above $a_0$ to
scale-invariant dynamics much below $a_0$. b. The intriguing connection of
$a_0$ with cosmology. c. The Newtonian limit corresponds to local departure
$|\zeta|\ll\ell_0$; i.e., $\phi-\phi_0\sim a_0\zeta\ll a_0\ell_0\sim c^2$ -
whereas relativity enters when $|\zeta|\not\ll\ell_0$. The model also opens new
vistas for extension, e.g., it points to possible dependence of $a_0$ on
$\phi$, and to $a_0$ losing its status and meaning altogether in the
relativistic regime. The required global balance of the brane might solve the
`old' cosmological-constant problem. I discuss possible connections with the
nearly-de-Sitter nature of our Universe. (Abridged.)

two-dimensional (2D) beam direction in fading channel environments; (2) low

life-style and environmental factors may influence multiples genes to aggravate
this disorder. Several low-risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have
been associated with BMI. However, identified loci only explain a small
proportion of the variation ob-served for this phenotype. The linear nature of
genome wide association studies (GWAS) used to identify associations between
genetic variants and the phenotype have had limited success in explaining the
heritability variation of BMI and shown low predictive capacity in
classification studies. GWAS ignores the epistatic interactions that less
significant variants have on the phenotypic outcome. In this paper we utilise a
novel deep learning-based methodology to reduce the high dimensional space in
GWAS and find epistatic interactions between SNPs for classification purposes.
SNPs were filtered based on the effects associations have with BMI. Since
Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing is highly conservative, an important
proportion of SNPs involved in SNP-SNP interactions are ignored. Therefore,
only SNPs with p-values < 1x10-2 were considered for subsequent epistasis
analysis using stacked auto encoders (SAE). This allows the nonlinearity
present in SNP-SNP interactions to be discovered through progressively smaller

reconstructed assuming known phases. When phases are unknown, oversampling and
a constraint on the support region in the original object can be used to solve
a non-convex optimization problem.
  Such schemes are ill-suited to find the optimum solution for sparse data,
since the recorded image does not correspond exactly to the original wave
function. We construct a convex optimization problem using a relaxed support
constraint and a maximum-likelihood treatment of the recorded data as a sample
from the underlying wave function. We also stress the need to use relevant
windowing techniques to account for the sampled pattern being finite.
  On simulated data, we demonstrate the benefits of our approach in terms of
visual quality and an improvement in the crystallographic R-factor from .4 to
.1 for highly noisy data.

across instead of accumulate statically on the central point and form
singularities there. In quantum language, this oscillation not only resolves
central singularities of the blackhole but also blurs its horizon remarkably.
This blurring makes the horizon not a zero-thickness geometric surface any
more, but an extended physic region whose thickness is comparable with the
horizon radius itself. It is our negligence of this fact that leads to the
information missing puzzle, and other related question in blackhole physics.
Besides the title question and Schwarzschild singularity's resolving, the
current work also provides interpretations for the origin of Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy and an explicitly unitary formulation of Hawking radiations.

bilinear terms which was shown to be not only present in Coulomb gauge but also
in Lorenz gauge by Selberg and Tesfahun, who proved global well-posedness for
finite energy data in three space dimensions. This null structure is combined
with product estimates for wave-Sobolev spaces. Crucial for the improvement are
the solution spaces introduced by Klainerman-Selberg. Preliminary results were

describes a competitive two-player game for sophomore students in a modern
physics survey course or junior/senior students in an introductory quantum
mechanics course to build intuition and quantitative understanding of the
probabilistic nature of quantum measurements in two-level systems such as
qubits or the Stern-Gerlach experiment. The goal of the game is to guess a
quantum state secretly chosen from a given set in the fewest number of
measurements. It uses twenty-sided dice or other classical random number
generators to simulate quantum measurements. The Bloch vector formalism is
introduced to give a geometric description of the quantum states and
measurement outcomes. Several ready-to-use sets of quantum states are given, so
readers can jump right in and try the game themselves without any prior
knowledge of quantum mechanics. More advanced students can also use the game in
suggested follow-up exercises to deepen students' understanding of quantum
measurements and their statistical description.

any desired order of the original multi-scale system. We corroborate our
analytical findings by numerical examples, showing significant improvements to

to their remarkable performance and low processing cost, particularly for solar
cells. However, for perovskite light-emitting diodes (LEDs), non-radiative
charge carrier recombination has limited electroluminescence (EL) efficiency.
Here we demonstrate perovskite-polymer bulk heterostructure LEDs exhibiting
record-high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) exceeding 20%, and an EL
half-life of 46 hours under continuous operation. This performance is achieved
with an emissive layer comprising quasi-2D and 3D perovskites and an insulating
polymer. Transient optical spectroscopy reveals that photogenerated excitations
at the quasi-2D perovskite component migrate to lower-energy sites within 1 ps.
The dominant component of the photoluminescence (PL) is primarily bimolecular
and is characteristic of the 3D regions. From PL quantum efficiency and
transient kinetics of the emissive layer with/without charge-transport
contacts, we find non-radiative recombination pathways to be effectively
eliminated. Light outcoupling from planar LEDs, as used in OLED displays,
generally limits EQE to 20-30%, and we model our reported EL efficiency of over
20% in the forward direction to indicate the internal quantum efficiency (IQE)
to be close to 100%. Together with the low drive voltages needed to achieve
useful photon fluxes (2-3 V for 0.1-1 mA/cm2), these results establish that
perovskite-based LEDs have significant potential for light-emission
applications.

microscopic transport model based on ultra-relativistic quantum molecular
dynamics are analyzed for the purpose. The centrality and pseudorapidity
dependence of the net-charge fluctuation of hadrons are examined. Our simulated
results are compared with the results available for nucleus-nucleus collision
experiments held at similar energies. The gross features of our simulated
results on net-charge fluctuations are found to be consistent with the
experiment. At incident beam energy $E_{\rm lab}=10A$ GeV the magnitude of
net-charge fluctuation is very large, and in comparison with the rest its
centrality dependence appears to be a little unusual. The effect of global
charge conservation is expected to be very crucial at FAIR energies. The charge
fluctuations measured with varying pesudorapidity window size depend on the
collision centrality. The dependence is however exactly opposite in nature to
that observed in the Pb+Pb collision at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=2.76$ TeV.
