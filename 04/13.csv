50571), a star hosting a debris disk resolved in the far infrared.
Interestingly, the companion location is compatible with an orbit coplanar with
the disk and interior to the debris belt. This feature makes the system a
valuable laboratory to analyze the formation of substellar companions in a
circumstellar disk and potential disk-companion dynamical interactions. Aims.
We aim to further characterize the orbital motion of HR 2562 B and its
interactions with the host star debris disk. Methods. We performed a monitoring
of the system over ~10 months in 2016 and 2017 with the VLT/SPHERE exoplanet
imager. Results. We confirm that the companion is comoving with the star and
detect for the first time an orbital motion at high significance, with a
current orbital motion projected in the plane of the sky of 25 mas (~0.85 au)
per year. No orbital curvature is seen in the measurements. An orbital fit of
the SPHERE and literature astrometry of the companion without priors on the
orbital plane clearly indicates that its orbit is (quasi-)coplanar with the
disk. To further constrain the other orbital parameters, we used empirical laws
for a companion chaotic zone validated by N-body simulations to test the
orbital solutions that are compatible with the estimated disk cavity size.
Non-zero eccentricities (>0.15) are allowed for orbital periods shorter than
100 yr, while only moderate eccentricities up to ~0.3 for orbital periods
longer than 200 yr are compatible with the disk observations. A comparison of
synthetic Herschel images to the real data does not allow us to constrain the
upper eccentricity of the companion.

enables to restore them with minimal error. We show that a key limitation of
existing algorithms is that they rely on error measures that are extremely
sensitive to geometric deformations (e.g. SSD, SSIM). These force the encoder
to invest many bits in describing the exact geometry of every fine detail in
the image, which is obviously wasteful, because the human visual system is
indifferent to small local translations. Motivated by this observation, we
propose a deformation-insensitive error measure that can be easily incorporated
into any existing compression scheme. As we show, optimal compression under our
criterion involves slightly deforming the input image such that it becomes more
""compressible"". Surprisingly, while these small deformations are barely
noticeable, they enable the CODEC to preserve details that are otherwise
completely lost. Our technique uses the CODEC as a ""black box"", thus allowing
simple integration with arbitrary compression methods. Extensive experiments,
including user studies, confirm that our approach significantly improves the
visual quality of many CODECs. These include JPEG, JPEG2000, WebP, BPG, and a

By performing neutron powder diffraction experiments and magnetization
measurements, we find that long-range magnetic order cannot be established in
LiNixMnyCozO2 even at low temperature of 3 K. Remarkably, the frustration
parameters of these compounds are estimated to be larger than 30, indicating
the existence of strongly frustrated magnetic interactions between spins of TM
ions. As frustration will inevitably give rise to lattice instability, the
formation of Li/Ni exchange in LiNixMnyCozO2 will help to partially relieve the
degeneracy of the frustrated magnetic lattice by forming a stable
antiferromagnetic state in hexagonal sublattice with nonmagnetic ions located
in centers of the hexagons. Moreover, Li/Ni exchange will introduce 180{\deg}
superexchange interaction, which further relieves the magnetic frustration
through bringing in new exchange paths. Thus, the variation of Li/Ni exchange
ratio vs. TM mole fraction in LiNixMnyCozO2 with different compositions can be
well understood and predicted in terms of magnetic frustration and
superexchange interactions. This provides a unique viewpoint to study the Li/Ni

with ${\rm SU}(2)$ gauge symmetry for an arbitrary constant non-Abelian current
in Euclidean space ${\mathbb R}^n$ of arbitrary finite dimension $n$. Using the
invariance of the Yang-Mills equations under the orthogonal transformations of
coordinates and gauge invariance, we choose a specific system of coordinates
and a specific gauge fixing for each constant current and obtain all constant
solutions of the Yang-Mills equations in this system of coordinates with this
gauge fixing, and then in the original system of coordinates with the original
gauge fixing. We use the singular value decomposition method and the method of
two-sheeted covering of orthogonal group by spin group to do this. We prove
that the number (0, 1, or 2) of constant solutions of the Yang-Mills equations
in terms of the strength of the Yang-Mills field depends on the singular values
of the matrix of current. The explicit form of all solutions and the invariant
$F^2$ can always be written using singular values of this matrix. The relevance
of the study is explained by the fact that the Yang-Mills equations describe
electroweak interactions in the case of the Lie group ${\rm SU}(2)$.
Nonconstant solutions of the Yang-Mills equations can be considered in the form
of series of perturbation theory. The results of this paper are new and can be
used to solve some problems in particle physics, in particular, to describe
physical vacuum and to fully understand a quantum gauge theory.

a reference object of known shape. Here it is shown that reference objects that

The extracted general model is applied for two particular cases, i.e., the

of physic and mathematics together. It is based on two ideas, the localization
of mathematical systems in space or space time, and the separation of the
concepts of number from number value. The separation of number from number
value along with the freedom of choice of number values at different points of
space or space time enables the introduction of a space or space time dependent
number valuation field. The presence of a location dependent number value field
affects theoretical descriptions of many physical and geometric quantities. A
simple geometric example is worked out in detail, that of the length of a path.
  The localization of mathematical systems and the separation of number from
number value or meaning both emphasize the role of observers. The separation of
number from number value shows the role of observers in that value or meaning
are conscious observer related concepts. Nothing, including numbers, has value
or meaning to an unconscious observer. The localization of mathematical systems
also shows the role of observers in that the mathematics that is potentially
available to an observer is that at the same position as is the observer. This
represents the mathematical knowledge that can reside in an observers brain. As
an observer moves in space or space time, the mathematical knowledge
potentially available to the observer is the collection of mathematical systems
at the same location as the observer. It is hoped that this work, which was
begun in 2010, will lead to a better understanding of the relation between the
foundations of mathematics and physics, and the role that observers play in
this relation.

thus far, KSN2015K, with a rise time of only 2.2 days and a time above
half-maximum ($t_{1/2}$) of only 6.8 days. Here we show that, unlike Type Ia
supernovae, the light curve of KSN2015K was not powered by the decay of
radioactive elements. We further argue that it is unlikely that it was powered
by continuing energy deposition from a central remnant (a magnetar or black
hole). Using numerical radiation hydrodynamical models, we show that the light
curve of KSN2015K is well fit by a model where the supernova runs into external
material presumably expelled in a pre-supernova mass loss episode. The rapid
rise of KSN2015K therefore probes the venting of photons when a hypersonic
shock wave breaks out of a dense extended medium.

differences applied between the various electrodes provide an efficient
collection of ionization electrons within the MM-THGEM holes and a large charge
avalanche multiplication between the meshes. Different from conventional
hole-type multipliers (e.g. Gas Electron Multipliers - GEMs, Thick Gas Electron
Multipliers - THGEMs, etc.), which are characterized by a variable
(dipole-like) field strength inside the avalanche gap, electrons in MM-THGEMs
are largely multiplied by a strong uniform field established between the two
meshes, like in the parallel-plate avalanche geometry. The presence of the two
meshes within the holes allows for the trapping of a large fraction of the
positive ions that stream back to the drift region. A gas gain above 10^5 has
been achieved for single photo-electron detection with a single MM-THGEM in
Ar/(10%)CH4 and He/(10%)CO2, at standard conditions for temperature and
pressure. When the MM-THGEM is coupled to a conventional THGEM and used as
first cascade element, the maximum achievable gains reach values above 10^6 in
He/(10%)CO2, while the IBF approaches of 1.5% in the case of optimum
detector-bias configuration. This IBF value is several times lower compared to
the one obtained by a double GEM/THGEM detector (5-10%), and equivalent to the
performance attained by a Micromegas detector.

two-dimensional QCD in the large $N$ limit. In contrast to the original
derivation via diagrammatic techniques exemplified by Dyson-Schwinger and
Bethe-Salpeter equations, here we employ the Hamiltonian operator approach to
reconstruct the celebrated 't Hooft equation in light-front quantization, and
Bars-Green equations in equal-time quantization. The novelty of our derivation
is to employ the soft momentum cutoff as the IR regulator. As a virtue of this
operator approach, the functional form of the quasi distributions can be
transparently built out of the Bars-Green wave functions and the Bogoliubov
angle with the aid of bosonization technique. Equipped with various bound-state
wave functions numerically inferred in [1], we then investigate how rapidly the
quasi distributions approach their light-cone counterparts with the increasing
meson momentum. We observe that, light mesons' quasi distributions approach the
light-cone distributions in a slower pace than the heavy quarkonia. Curiously,
lattice simulations of quasi distributions in four-dimensional QCD also
discover this feature. Furthermore, we also compute the partonic light-cone PDF

growth through the use of solid electrolytes has emerged as one of the most
promising strategies for enabling the use of Li metal anodes. We perform a
computational screening of over 12,000 inorganic solids based on their ability
to suppress dendrite initiation in contact with Li metal anode. Properties for
mechanically isotropic and anisotropic interfaces that can be used in stability
criteria for determining the propensity of dendrite initiation are usually
obtained from computationally expensive first-principles methods. In order to
obtain a large dataset for screening, we use machine learning models to predict
the mechanical properties of several new solid electrolytes. We train a
convolutional neural network on the shear and bulk moduli purely on structural
features of the material. We use AdaBoost, Lasso and Bayesian ridge regression
to train the elastic constants, where the choice of the model depended on the
size of the training data and the noise that it can handle. Our models give us
direct interpretability by revealing the dominant structural features affecting
the elastic constants. The stiffness is found to increase with a decrease in
volume per atom, increase in minimum anion-anion separation, and increase in
sublattice (all but Li) packing fraction. Cross-validation/test performance
suggests our models generalize well. We predict over 20 mechanically
anisotropic interfaces between Li metal and 6 solid electrolytes which can be
used to suppress dendrite growth. Our screened candidates are generally soft

The shape of this law is crucial to test galaxy formation models, which are
currently discrepant especially at the lowest masses, allowing to constrain
fundamental parameters, e.g. the retained fraction of angular momentum. In this
study, we accurately determine the empirical $j_\ast-M_\ast$ relation (Fall

significantly improve all previous estimates of the Fall relation by
determining $j_\ast$ profiles homogeneously for all galaxies, using extended HI
rotation curves, and selecting only galaxies for which a robust $j_\ast$ could
be measured (converged $j_\ast(<R)$ radial profile). We find the relation to be
well described by a single, unbroken power-law $j_\ast\propto M_\ast^\alpha$

photoevaporated gas fraction is proportional to the square root of the SFE. The
measured momentum injection due to thermal and radiation pressure forces is
proportional to $\Sigma_0^{-0.74}$, and the ejection of neutrals substantially
contributes to the disruption of low-mass and/or high-surface density clouds.
We present semi-analytic models for cloud dispersal mediated by
photoevaporation and by dynamical mass ejection, and show that the predicted
net SFE and mass loss efficiencies are consistent with the results of our
numerical simulations.

arising through operator mixing, which we call $\theta$-jet and $\theta$-soft

which captures the generic features of subleading power resummation, allowing
us to derive the structure of the RG to all orders in $\alpha_s$, and provide
field theory definitions of all ingredients. As a simple application, we use
this to obtain an analytic leading logarithmic result for the subleading power
resummed thrust spectrum for $H\to gg$ in pure glue QCD. This resummation
determines the nature of the double logarithmic series at subleading power,
which we find is still governed by the cusp anomalous dimension. We check our
result by performing an analytic calculation up to ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^3)$.
Consistency of the subleading power RG relates subleading power anomalous
dimensions, constrains the form of the $\theta$-soft and $\theta$-jet

the subleading power collinear limit. Our results provide a path for carrying

of our BAL QSOs exhibit at least one disappearing BAL. We estimate the average
lifetime of a BAL along our line of sight (~ 80-100 yr), which appears
consistent with the accretion disk orbital time at distances where winds are
thought to originate. We inspect properties of the disappearing BALs and
compare them to the properties of our main sample. We also investigate the
existence of a correlation in the variability of multiple troughs in the same
spectrum, and find it persistent at large velocity offsets between BAL pairs,
suggesting that a mechanism extending on a global scale is necessary to explain
the phenomenon. We select a more reliable sample of disappearing BALs following

galaxies from all three groups are in excellent agreement with Local Group
dwarf galaxies in terms of: stellar mass-velocity dispersion, stellar
mass-metallicity relation, star formation histories, and stellar mass
functions. Satellites and nearby galaxies show lower velocity dispersions and
gas fractions compared to field galaxies. While field galaxies follow global
abundance matching relations, satellites and nearby galaxies deviate from them,
showing lower dark matter masses for given stellar mass. The reason for this
deficit in dark matter mass is substantial mass loss experienced by satellites
and $\sim80$\% of the nearby galaxies, while orbiting inside $R_{200}$ at
earlier times. However, both satellites and nearby objects fall back onto the
relation for field galaxies if we use the maximum of their virial mass instead
of the present-day value. This allows us to provide estimates for the peak
masses of observed Local Group galaxies. Finally, using radial velocities,
distances, and the velocity dispersion-stellar mass relation from our

central object and unaffected ones. Applying this metric to observed objects we
find that even far away dwarf galaxies like Eri II ($D\approx$ 370 kpc) have a
strong probability ($\approx 83$\%) of having been affected by the Milky Way in
the past. This naturally explains the lack of gas and recent star formation

radio quasars at $z>2$, relying on high counting statistic ($\gtrsim10\,000$
photons) provided by XMM-Newton, with additional NuSTAR (and simultaneous
Swift-XRT) observations when available. Blazars can be confidently considered
to have negligible X-ray absorption along the line of sight within the host

ideal for testing the absorption component along the IGM. Our new approach is
to revisit the origin of the soft X-ray spectral hardening observed in high-z
blazars in terms of X-ray absorption occurring along the IGM, with the help of
a low-z sample used as comparison. We verify that the presence of absorption in
excess of the Galactic value is the preferred explanation to explain the
observed hardening, while intrinsic energy breaks, predicted by blazars'
emission models, can easily occur out of the observing energy band in most
sources. First, we perform an indirect analysis comparing the inferred amount
of absorption in excess of the Galactic value with a simulated IGM absorption
contribution, that increases with redshift and includes both a minimum
component from diffuse IGM metals, and the additional contribution of discrete
denser intervening regions. Then, we directly investigate the warm-hot IGM with
a spectral model on the best candidates of our sample, obtaining an average IGM

Emission nebulae were associated with a number of the cool hypergiants while,

the mass-loss rates for a unique population of massive post-main sequence stars
at every stage of evolution, confirming a significant increase as stars
transition from OB supergiant to WR states. The range of spectral types
exhibited provides a critical test of radiatively driven wind theory and the
reality of the bi-stability jump. The extreme mass-loss rate inferred for the

and supermassive stars (SMSs, $>10^3\,{\rm M}_\odot$) to address the origin of
the HeCNONaMgAl abundance anomalies in GCs. GCs form in converging gas flows
and accumulate low-angular momentum gas, which accretes onto protostars. This
leads to an adiabatic contraction of the cluster and an increase of the stellar
collision rate. A SMS can form via runaway collisions if the cluster reaches
sufficiently high density before two-body relaxation halts the contraction.
This condition is met if the number of stars $\gtrsim10^6$ and the gas
accretion rate $\gtrsim10^5\,{\rm M}_\odot$/Myr, reminiscent of GC formation in
high gas-density environments, such as -- but not restricted to -- the early
Universe. The strong SMS wind mixes with the inflowing pristine gas, such that
the protostars accrete diluted hot-hydrogen burning yields of the SMS. Because
of continuous rejuvenation, the amount of processed material liberated by the
SMS can be an order of magnitude higher than its maximum mass. This
`conveyor-belt' production of hot-hydrogen burning products provides a solution
to the mass budget problem that plagues other scenarios. Additionally, the
liberated material is mildly enriched in helium and relatively rich in other
hot-hydrogen burning products, in agreement with abundances of GCs today.
Finally, we find a super-linear scaling between the amount of processed
material and cluster mass, providing an explanation for the observed increase
of the fraction of processed material with GC mass. We discuss open questions
of this new GC enrichment scenario and propose observational tests.

data (source domain) and test data (target domain) are sampled from the same
distribution is often violated. This is known as the domain adaptation problem.
In this work, we propose a novel domain-adaptive dictionary learning framework
for cross-domain visual recognition. Our method generates a set of intermediate
domains. These intermediate domains form a smooth path and bridge the gap
between the source and target domains. Specifically, we not only learn a common
dictionary to encode the domain-shared features, but also learn a set of
domain-specific dictionaries to model the domain shift. The separation of the
common and domain-specific dictionaries enables us to learn more compact and
reconstructive dictionaries for domain adaptation. These dictionaries are
learned by alternating between domain-adaptive sparse coding and dictionary
updating steps. Meanwhile, our approach gradually recovers the feature
representations of both source and target data along the domain path. By
aligning all the recovered domain data, we derive the final domain-adaptive
features for cross-domain visual recognition. Extensive experiments on three
public datasets demonstrates that our approach outperforms most
state-of-the-art methods.

slightly higher than has been thought previously, $[M/H]\simeq0.40$ (${\bf Z}

neutral phase of the interstellar medium. The optical spectroscopy of CH is
limited by interstellar extinction, whereas far-infrared observations provide
an integral view through the Galaxy. While the HF ground state absorption,
another H$_2$ proxy in diffuse gas, frequently suffers from saturation, CH
remains transparent both in spiral-arm crossings and high-mass star forming
regions, turning this light hydride into a universal surrogate for H$_2$.
However, in slow shocks and in regions dissipating turbulence its abundance is
expected to be enhanced by an endothermic production path, and the idea of a
""canonical"" CH abundance needs to be addressed. The $N=2\leftarrow 1$ ground
state transition of CH at $\lambda 149\,\mu$m has become accessible to
high-resolution spectroscopy thanks to GREAT aboard SOFIA. Its unsaturated
absorption and the absence of emission makes it an ideal candidate for the
determination of column densities with a minimum of assumptions. Here we
present an analysis of four sightlines towards distant, far-infrared bright
Galactic star forming regions. If combined with the sub-millimeter line of CH
at $\lambda 560\,\mu$m, environments forming massive stars can be analyzed. For
this we present a case study on the ""proto-Trapezium"" cluster W3 IRS5, and
demonstrate that the sub-millimeter/far-infrared lines of CH reliably trace not
only diffuse but also dense, molecular gas. While we confirm the global
correlation between the column densities of HF and those of CH, clear signposts
of an over-abundance of CH are observed towards lower densities. A quiescent
ion-neutral chemistry alone cannot account for this over-abundance. Vortices
forming in turbulent, diffuse gas may be the setting for an enhanced production
path.

  Computing",,,,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With their wide fields of view and often relatively long coverage of any
position in the sky in imaging survey mode, modern radio telescopes provide a
data stream that is naturally suited to searching for rare transients. However,
Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) can show up in the data stream in similar
ways to such transients, and thus the normal pre-treatment of filtering RFI
(flagging) may also remove astrophysical transients from the data stream before
imaging. In this paper we investigate how standard flagging affects the
detectability of such transients by examining the case of transient detection
in an observing mode used for Low Frequency Array (LOFAR; \citep{LOFAR})
surveys. We quantify the fluence range of transients that would be detected,
and the reduction of their SNR due to partial flagging. We find that transients
with a duration close to the integration sampling time, as well as bright
transients with durations on the order of tens of seconds, are completely
flagged. For longer transients on the order of several tens of seconds to
minutes, the flagging effects are not as severe, although part of the signal is
lost. For these transients, we present a modified flagging strategy which
mitigates the effect of flagging on transient signals. We also present a script
which uses the differences between the two strategies, and known differences
between transient RFI and astrophysical transients, to notify the observer when
a potential transient is in the data stream.

angular resolution ($30\times42$~mas) observations we have, for the first time,
resolved stellar rotation of an AGB star, R~Dor. We measure an angular rotation
velocity of $\omega_R\sin{i}=(3.5\pm0.3)\times10^{-9}$~rad~s$^{-1}$ which
indicates a rotational velocity of $|\upsilon_{\rm

$214$~GHz). The rotation axis projected on the plane of the sky has a position
angle $\Phi=7\pm6^\circ$. We find that the rotation of R Dor is two orders of
magnitude faster than expected for a solitary AGB star that will have lost most
of its angular momentum. Its rotational velocity is consistent with angular
momentum transfer from a close companion. As a companion has not been directly
detected we thus suggest R~Dor has a low-mass, close-in, companion. The
rotational velocity approaches the critical velocity, set by the local sound
speed in the extended envelope, and is thus expected to affect the mass loss
characteristics of R~Dor.

regulates flagellar bending are still under investigation. We extend our
previous model of planar flagellar bending by developing a fluid-structure
interaction model that couples the three-dimensional motion of the flagellum in
a viscous, Newtonian fluid with the evolving calcium concentration. The
flagellum is modeled as a Kirchhoff rod: an elastic rod with preferred
curvature and twist. The calcium dynamics are represented as a one-dimensional
reaction-diffusion model on a moving domain, the centerline of the flagellum.
The two models are coupled assuming that the preferred curvature and twist of
the sperm flagellum depend on the local calcium concentration. To investigate
the effect of calcium on sperm motility, we compare model results of flagellar
bend amplitude and swimming speed for three cases: planar, helical (spiral with
equal amplitude in both directions), and quasi-planar (spiral with small
amplitude in one direction). We observe that for the same parameters, the
planar swimmer is faster and a turning motion is more clearly observed when
calcium coupling is accounted for in the model. In the case of flagellar
bending coupled to the calcium concentration, we observe emergent trajectories
that can be characterized as a hypotrochoid for both quasi-planar and helical
bending.

labelled data which contains the onset and offset annotations of sound events.
However, many audio tagging datasets are weakly labelled, that is, only the
presence of the sound events is known, without knowing their onset and offset
annotations. In this paper, we propose a time-frequency (T-F) segmentation
framework trained on weakly labelled data to tackle the sound event detection

representation, such as log mel spectrogram of an audio clip to obtain T-F
segmentation masks of sound events. The T-F segmentation masks can be used for
separating the sound events from the background scenes in the time-frequency
domain. Then a classification mapping is applied on the T-F segmentation masks
to estimate the presence probabilities of the sound events. We model the
segmentation mapping using a convolutional neural network and the
classification mapping using a global weighted rank pooling (GWRP). In SED,
predicted onset and offset times can be obtained from the T-F segmentation
masks. As a byproduct, separated waveforms of sound events can be obtained from
the T-F segmentation masks. We remixed the DCASE 2018 Task 1 acoustic scene

unique perspectives on constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection: signal

is shown to be a finite impulse response band-pass filter. From a statistical
pattern recognition perspective, CFAR is shown to be a suboptimal one-class
classifier: a Euclidian distance classifier and a quadratic discriminant with a
missing term for one-parameter and two-parameter CFAR, respectively. We make a
contribution toward enabling an objective design and implementation for target

also dictionaries---they actually contain the strings in $S$. For very large

structures that support \emph{weak} prefix searches---they return the ranks of

asymptotically space-optimal. Previously, data structures such as String
B-trees (and more complicated cache-oblivious string data structures) have
implicitly supported weak prefix queries, but they all have query time that
grows logarithmically with the size of the string collection. In contrast, our
data structures are simple, naturally cache-efficient, and have query time that
depends only on the length of the prefix, all the way down to constant query
time for strings that fit in one machine word. We give several applications of
weak prefix searches, including exact prefix counting and approximate counting

error from the fact that the visible and infrared pulses have slightly
different shapes. Whether this delay emerges from the pulsar, is caused by
passing through wavelength-dependent media, or is caused by a violation of the

  Field Game",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) is a region in the brain that is
responsible for controlling circadian rhythms. The SCN contains on the order of
10^4 neuronal oscillators which have a preferred period slightly longer than 24
hours. The oscillators try to synchronize with each other as well as responding
to external stimuli such as sunlight exposure. A mean field game model for
these neuronal oscillators is formulated with two goals in mind: 1) to
understand the long time behavior of the oscillators when an individual remains
in the same time zone, and 2) to understand how the oscillators recover from
jet lag when the individual has traveled across time zones. In particular, we
would like to study the claim that jet lag is worse after traveling east than
west. Finite difference schemes are used to find numerical approximations to
the mean field game solutions. Numerical results are presented and conjectures
are posed. The numerics suggest the time to recover from jet lag is about the
same for east versus west trips, but the cost the oscillators accrue while
recovering is larger for eastward trips.

state on $n$ subsystems is close to an ideal mixed state $\varphi^{\otimes n}$
for a given reference state $\varphi$, up to errors on a few positions. This
task makes no sense classically: it would correspond to certifying that a given
bitstring was generated according to some desired probability distribution.
However, in the quantum case, this is possible if one has access to a prover
who can supply a purification of the mixed state.
  In this work, we introduce the concept of mixed-state certification, and we
show that a natural sampling protocol offers secure certification in the
presence of a possibly dishonest prover: if the verifier accepts then he can be
almost certain that the state in question has been correctly prepared, up to a
small number of errors.
  We then apply this result to two-party quantum coin-tossing. Given that
strong coin tossing is impossible, it is natural to ask ""how close can we get"".
This question has been well studied and is nowadays well understood from the
perspective of the bias of individual coin tosses. We approach and answer this
question from a different---and somewhat orthogonal---perspective, where we do
not look at individual coin tosses but at the global entropy instead. We show
how two distrusting parties can produce a common high-entropy source, where the
entropy is an arbitrarily small fraction below the maximum (except with
negligible probability).

problem in computer vision. Given an image in the source domain, the goal is to
learn the conditional distribution of corresponding images in the target
domain, without seeing any pairs of corresponding images. While this
conditional distribution is inherently multimodal, existing approaches make an
overly simplified assumption, modeling it as a deterministic one-to-one
mapping. As a result, they fail to generate diverse outputs from a given source
domain image. To address this limitation, we propose a Multimodal Unsupervised
Image-to-image Translation (MUNIT) framework. We assume that the image
representation can be decomposed into a content code that is domain-invariant,
and a style code that captures domain-specific properties. To translate an
image to another domain, we recombine its content code with a random style code
sampled from the style space of the target domain. We analyze the proposed
framework and establish several theoretical results. Extensive experiments with
comparisons to the state-of-the-art approaches further demonstrates the
advantage of the proposed framework. Moreover, our framework allows users to
control the style of translation outputs by providing an example style image.

the entanglement polytopes from quantum information theory (in particular, we

the voltage envelope in different frequency bands. These asymmetric voltage
responses arise in a neuron model when it is submitted to high enough amplitude
oscillatory currents of variable frequencies. We show how the nonlinearities

oscillatory currents emphasize this response. We propose a geometrical

nonlinearities in their activation curves but also from nonlinearites captured
by the nullclines in the phase-plane diagram and from the system's time-scale
separation. In addition, we identify an unexpected frequency-dependent pattern
which develops in the gating variables of these currents and is a product of
strong nonlinearities in the system as we show by controlling such behavior by
manipulating the activation curve parameters. The results reported in this

frequently used as a text-mining tool for the discovery of hidden semantic
structures in text bodies. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a commonly used
topic model that aims to explain the structure of a corpus by grouping texts.
LDA requires multiple parameters to work well, and there are only rough and
sometimes conflicting guidelines available on how these parameters should be
set. In this paper, we contribute (i) a broad study of parameters to arrive at
good local optima for GitHub and Stack Overflow text corpora, (ii) an
a-posteriori characterisation of text corpora related to eight programming
languages, and (iii) an analysis of corpus feature importance via per-corpus
LDA configuration. We find that (1) popular rules of thumb for topic modelling
parameter configuration are not applicable to the corpora used in our
experiments, (2) corpora sampled from GitHub and Stack Overflow have different
characteristics and require different configurations to achieve good model fit,
and (3) we can predict good configurations for unseen corpora reliably. These
findings support researchers and practitioners in efficiently determining
suitable configurations for topic modelling when analysing textual data

in recent years. In the summer, melt ponds form on the surface of Arctic sea
ice, significantly lowering the ice reflectivity (albedo) and thereby
accelerating ice melt. Pond geometry controls the details of this crucial
feedback; however, a reliable model of pond geometry does not currently exist.
Here we show that a simple model of voids surrounding randomly sized and placed
overlapping circles reproduces the essential features of pond patterns. The
only two model parameters, characteristic circle radius and coverage fraction,
are chosen by comparing, between the model and the aerial photographs of the
ponds, two correlation functions which determine the typical pond size and
their connectedness. Using these parameters, the void model robustly reproduces
the ponds' area-perimeter and area-abundance relationships over more than 6
orders of magnitude. By analyzing the correlation functions of ponds on several
dates, we also find that the pond scale and the connectedness are surprisingly
constant across different years and ice types. Moreover, we find that ponds
resemble percolation clusters near the percolation threshold. These results
demonstrate that the geometry and abundance of Arctic melt ponds can be simply
described, which can be exploited in future models of Arctic melt ponds that
would improve predictions of the response of sea ice to Arctic warming.

this can be practically achieved by means of time-domain reflectometry (TDR)
that measures the reflections from a device due to an applied stimulus.
Conventional TDR allows for the measurement of systems comprising a single
impedance. However, real systems typically feature impedance variations that
obscure the determination of all impedances subsequent to the first one. This
problem has been studied previously and is generally known as scattering
inversion or, in the context of microwave metrology, time-domain ""peeling"". In
this article, we demonstrate the implementation of a space-time efficient
peeling algorithm that corrects for the effect of prior impedance mismatch in a
nonuniform lossless transmission line, regardless of the nature of the

stochastic machine learning clustering tool and an arbitrary lossy transmission
line modeling tool. The former mitigates many of the imperfections typically
plaguing TDR measurements (except for dispersion) and allows for an efficient
processing of large datasets; the latter allows for a complete transmission

can reduce passengers' waiting times by proactively dispatching vehicles to
locations where pickup requests are anticipated in the future. Yet it is
unclear how to best do this: optimal dispatching requires optimizing over
several sources of uncertainty, including vehicles' travel times to their
dispatched locations, as well as coordinating between vehicles so that they do
not attempt to pick up the same passenger. While prior works have developed
models for this uncertainty and used them to optimize dispatch policies, in
this work we introduce a model-free approach. Specifically, we propose MOVI, a
Deep Q-network (DQN)-based framework that directly learns the optimal vehicle
dispatch policy. Since DQNs scale poorly with a large number of possible
dispatches, we streamline our DQN training and suppose that each individual
vehicle independently learns its own optimal policy, ensuring scalability at
the cost of less coordination between vehicles. We then formulate a centralized
receding-horizon control (RHC) policy to compare with our DQN policies. To
compare these policies, we design and build MOVI as a large-scale realistic
simulator based on 15 million taxi trip records that simulates policy-agnostic
responses to dispatch decisions. We show that the DQN dispatch policy reduces
the number of unserviced requests by 76% compared to without dispatch and 20%
compared to the RHC approach, emphasizing the benefits of a model-free approach
and suggesting that there is limited value to coordinating vehicle actions.
This finding may help to explain the success of ridesharing platforms, for
which drivers make individual decisions.

been a few efforts to extract information from such security forums. We propose
RIPEx, a systematic approach to identify and label IP addresses in security
forums by utilizing a cross-forum learning method. In more detail, the
challenge is twofold: (a) identifying IP addresses from other numerical
entities, such as software version numbers, and (b) classifying the IP address
as benign or malicious. We propose an integrated solution that tackles both
these problems. A novelty of our approach is that it does not require training
data for each new forum. Our approach does knowledge transfer across forums: we
use a classifier from our source forums to identify seed information for
training a classifier on the target forum. We evaluate our method using data
collected from five security forums with a total of 31K users and 542K posts.
First, RIPEx can distinguish IP address from other numeric expressions with 95%
precision and above 93% recall on average. Second, RIPEx identifies malicious
IP addresses with an average precision of 88% and over 78% recall, using our
cross-forum learning. Our work is a first step towards harnessing the wealth of

between these two excitations evolves linearly, indicating that the nuclear

these two states is comparable, despite the 100x enhancement in nuclear
polarization provided by the presence of the Fe layer. At higher magnetic

obtain meaningful information, it is essential to ensure that data is
de-identified and unnecessary clinical information is minimized to protect
personal information. This process requires criteria and an appropriate method
as there are clear identifiers as well as quasi-identifiers that are not
readily identifiable. Methods; To formulate such a method, first, primary
quasi-identifiers were selected by classifying information in 20 clinical
personal information database tables into Direct-Identifier (DID),
Quasi-Identifier (QI), Sensitive Attribute (SA), and Non-Sensitive Attribute
(NSA) according to its type. Secondary QIs were then selected by assessing the
risk for outliers by measuring uniqueness values of the selected data and
scoring re-identification by calculating equivalence class of the influence on
other data on QI removal. Third, the risk of re-identification of data users
was numeralized and classified. Lastly, the final QI according to user class
was determined by comparing the calculated re-identification scores to the
threshold values of user classes. Results; Eventually, final QIs ranging from a
minimum of 18 to a maximum of 28 were selected by making an assumption about
user classes and using it as criteria. Conclusions; The QI selection method
presented by the current investigators can be used by researchers at the final
checkup stage before they de-identify the selected QIs. Therefore, clinical

that the weak interaction can be measured with high accuracy when exciting the
target cavity by quantum light scattered from the source in the halfway between
the central peak and each side peak. This originally comes from the strong
correlation of the injected quantum photons. In principle, our proposal can be
applied into the normal cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) system described
by JC model and optomechanical system. Furthermore, it is state-of-the-art for
experiment even when the interaction strength is downed to a very small value.

the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations lose their equivalence. In fact,
the Lagrangian including the accelerations with or without truncations can be

spectrum and energy-efficient next generation wireless communications systems
since it strikes a good balance among error performance, complexity, and
spectral efficiency. IM technique, when applied to multicarrier waveforms,
yields the ability to convey the information not only by M-ary signal
constellations as in conventional multicarrier systems but also by the indexes
of the subcarriers, which are activated according to the incoming bit stream.
Although IM is well studied for OFDM based systems, FBMC with index modulation
has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we shed light on the
potential and implementation of IM technique for QAM based FBMC system. We
start with a mathematical model of the IM based QAM-FBMC system (FBMC/QAM-IM)
along with the derivation of interference terms at the receiver due to channel
distortions and noise. The interference terms including the ones introduced by
the multipath channel are analyzed in terms of MSE and output SINR. It is shown
with analytical and simulation results that the interference power in
FBMC/QAM-IM is smaller compared to that of the conventional FBMC/QAM system as
some of the subcarriers are inactive. The performance of FBMC/QAM with IM is
investigated by comparing the SIR and output SINR with that of the conventional
FBMC/QAM system along with the BER performance which shows that the FBMC/QAM-IM
is a promising transmission technique for future wireless networks.

the emergence of hydrodynamic behavior in systems undergoing Bjorken flow. In
this paper we determine for the first time the large order behavior of these
perturbative expansions in relativistic hydrodynamics in the case of Gubser
flow. While both series diverge, the slow-roll series can provide a much better
overall description of the system's dynamics than the gradient expansion when
both series are truncated at low orders. The truncated slow-roll series can
also describe the attractor solution of Gubser flow as long as the system is
sufficiently close to equilibrium near the origin (i.e., $\rho=0$) in $dS_3
\otimes \mathbb{R}$. Differently than the case of Bjorken flow, here we show
that the Gubser flow attractor solution is not solely a function of the
effective Knudsen number $\tau_R \sqrt{\sigma_{\mu\nu}\sigma^{\mu\nu}} \sim
\tau_R\, \tanh\rho$. Our results give further support to the idea that new

formed during solidification of a Lunar Magma Ocean (LMO) in which these rocks
would have floated to the surface. This early flotation crust would have formed
a thermal blanket over the remaining LMO, prolonging solidification.
Geochronology of lunar anorthosites indicates a long timescale of LMO cooling,
or re-melting and re-crystallization in one or more late events. To better
interpret this geochronology, we model LMO solidification in a scenario where
the Moon is being continuously bombarded by returning projectiles released from
the Moon-forming giant impact. More than one lunar mass of material escaped the
Earth-Moon system onto heliocentric orbits following the giant impact, much of
it to come back on returning orbits for a period of 100 Myr. If large enough,
these projectiles would have punctured holes in the nascent floatation crust of
the Moon, exposing the LMO to space and causing more rapid cooling. We model
these scenarios using a thermal evolution model of the Moon that allows for
production (by cratering) and evolution (solidification and infill) of holes in
the flotation crust that insulates the LMO. For effective hole production,
solidification of the magma ocean can be significantly expedited, decreasing
the cooling time by more than a factor of 5. If hole production is inefficient,
but shock conversion of projectile kinetic energy to thermal energy is
efficient, then LMO solidification can be somewhat prolonged, lengthening the
cooling time by 50% or more.

prediction of high-dimensional practical data sets, where the relationship
between input and output data is complex and cannot be represented well by
simple conventional models. Its effectiveness is shown in various tasks,
however, the lack of interpretability of the trained result by a layered neural
network has limited its application area.
  In our previous studies, we proposed methods for extracting a simplified
global structure of a trained layered neural network by classifying the units
into communities according to their connection patterns with adjacent layers.
These methods provided us with knowledge about the strength of the relationship
between communities from the existence of bundled connections, which are
determined by threshold processing of the connection ratio between pairs of
communities.
  However, it has been difficult to understand the role of each community
quantitatively by observing the modular structure. We could only know to which
sets of the input and output dimensions each community was mainly connected, by
tracing the bundled connections from the community to the input and output
layers. Another problem is that the finally obtained modular structure is
changed greatly depending on the setting of the threshold hyperparameter used
for determining bundled connections.
  In this paper, we propose a new method for interpreting quantitatively the
role of each community in inference, by defining the effect of each input
dimension on a community, and the effect of a community on each output
dimension. We show experimentally that our proposed method can reveal the role
of each part of a layered neural network by applying the neural networks to
three types of data sets, extracting communities from the trained network, and
applying the proposed method to the community structure.

of resistivity upturn in case of pure LNO, all the composites exhibit a

a method to automate the identification of malicious IP addresses with the
design goal of being independent of external sources. A key novelty is that we
use a matrix decomposition method to extract latent features of the behavioral
information of the users, which we combine with textual information from the
related posts. A key design feature of our technique is that it can be readily
applied to different language forums, since it does not require a sophisticated
Natural Language Processing approach. In particular, our solution only needs a
small number of keywords in the new language plus the users behavior captured
by specific features. We also develop a tool to automate the data collection
from security forums. Using our tool, we collect approximately 600K posts from
3 different forums. Our method exhibits high classification accuracy, while the
precision of identifying malicious IP in post is greater than 88% in all three

find up to 3 times more potentially malicious IP address compared to the
reference blacklist VirusTotal. As the cyber-wars are becoming more intense,
having early accesses to useful information becomes more imperative to remove
the hackers first-move advantage, and our work is a solid step towards this
direction.

strongly impacts the purposes of quantum theory as well as its areas of
application. In particular, it challenges current programs inspired by
classical reductionism, aiming at the emergence of the classical world from a
large number of quantum systems. In a second part, we analyze quantum physics

influences. We finally consider new technological applications of quantum

a spherical volume component delimited by a hypersurface and for the
hypersurface patch created by ball intersetions, showing that the eigenvalues

contains not only high-dimensional spatial information but also complex
temporal information. Video prediction can be performed by finding features in
recent frames, and using them to generate approximations to upcoming frames. We
approach this problem by disentangling spatial and temporal features in videos.
We introduce a mutual suppression network (MSnet) which are trained in an
adversarial manner and then produces spatial features which are free of motion
information, and motion features with no spatial information. MSnet then uses
motion-guided connection within an encoder-decoder-based architecture to
transform spatial features from a previous frame to the time of an upcoming
frame. We show how MSnet can be used for video prediction using disentangled
representations. We also carry out experiments to assess the effectiveness of
our method to disentangle features. MSnet obtains better results than other
recent video prediction methods even though it has simpler encoders.

quadrotors that unifies control and planning with respect to action and
perception objectives. Our framework leverages numerical optimization to
compute trajectories that satisfy the system dynamics and require control
inputs within the limits of the platform. Simultaneously, it optimizes
perception objectives for robust and reliable sens- ing by maximizing the
visibility of a point of interest and minimizing its velocity in the image
plane. Considering both perception and action objectives for motion planning
and control is challenging due to the possible conflicts arising from their
respective requirements. For example, for a quadrotor to track a reference
trajectory, it needs to rotate to align its thrust with the direction of the
desired acceleration. However, the perception objective might require to
minimize such rotation to maximize the visibility of a point of interest. A
model-based optimization framework, able to consider both perception and action
objectives and couple them through the system dynamics, is therefore necessary.
Our perception-aware model predictive control framework works in a
receding-horizon fashion by iteratively solving a non-linear optimization
problem. It is capable of running in real-time, fully onboard our lightweight,
small-scale quadrotor using a low-power ARM computer, to- gether with a

chunks of memory primarily through the malloc API. Many memory allocators also
implement other API extensions, such as deriving the size of an allocated
object from the object's pointer, or calculating the base address of an
allocation from an interior pointer. In this paper, we propose a general
purpose extended allocator API built around these common extensions. We argue
that such extended APIs have many applications and demonstrate several use
cases, such as (manual) memory error detection, meta data storage, typed
pointers and compact data-structures. Because most existing allocators were not
designed for the extended API, traditional implementations are expensive or not
possible.
  Recently, the LowFat allocator for heap and stack objects has been developed.
The LowFat allocator is an implementation of the idea of low-fat pointers,
where object bounds information (size and base) are encoded into the native
machine pointer representation itself. The ""killer app"" for low-fat pointers is
automated bounds check instrumentation for program hardening and bug detection.
However, the LowFat allocator can also be used to implement highly optimized
version of the extended allocator API, which makes the new applications (listed
above) possible. In this paper, we implement and evaluate several applications
based efficient memory allocator API extensions using low-fat pointers. We also
extend the LowFat allocator to cover global objects for the first time.

obtained by two types of offline calibration according to the degree of freedom

unconstrained blurry, noisy, low-resolution, or compressed image (i.e.,
degraded observation). For better recovery of fine facial details, we modify
the problem setting by taking both the degraded observation and a high-quality
guided image of the same identity as input to our guided face restoration
network (GFRNet). However, the degraded observation and guided image generally
are different in pose, illumination and expression, thereby making plain CNNs
(e.g., U-Net) fail to recover fine and identity-aware facial details. To tackle
this issue, our GFRNet model includes both a warping subnetwork (WarpNet) and a
reconstruction subnetwork (RecNet). The WarpNet is introduced to predict flow
field for warping the guided image to correct pose and expression (i.e., warped
guidance), while the RecNet takes the degraded observation and warped guidance
as input to produce the restoration result. Due to that the ground-truth flow
field is unavailable, landmark loss together with total variation
regularization are incorporated to guide the learning of WarpNet. Furthermore,
to make the model applicable to blind restoration, our GFRNet is trained on the
synthetic data with versatile settings on blur kernel, noise level,
downsampling scale factor, and JPEG quality factor. Experiments show that our
GFRNet not only performs favorably against the state-of-the-art image and face
restoration methods, but also generates visually photo-realistic results on
real degraded facial images.

indicating that it is of pure chiral geometry. For the lower-energy member of
the doublet, the contribution of the $|\mathcal{P}\rangle$ component to the
eigenfunction first decreases and then increases as a function of the total

both determined by the Hamiltonian matrix elements between the planar

find charge density and screening anomalies in single-gated multilayer

Due to the unique puckered lattice structure, both intralayer and interlayer
charge screenings are important in gated multilayer phosphorene. We find that
the electric-field tuning of the band structure of multilayer phosphorene is
distinctively different in the presence and absence of charge screening. For
instance, it is shown that the unscreened band gap of multilayer phosphorene
decreases dramatically with increasing electric-field strength. However, in the

significantly reduced and the reduction depends strongly on the number of

approximation taking into account the voltage drop on the dielectric layer. The
analysis shows, that characteristic features of the frequency dependence of the
impedance are determined by the ratio of the Debay length and the effective
thickness of the dielectric layer. The impact of the dielectric layer is
especially strong in the case of high concentrated electrolytes, where the
Debay length is small and thus comparable to the effective thickness of the
dielectric layer. To verify the model, measurements of the impedance spectra

high-dimensional signal $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}^n$ from noisy $1$-bit Gaussian
measurements. Our recovery approach is based on a simple convex program which
uses the hinge loss function as data fidelity term. While such a risk
minimization strategy is very natural to learn binary output models, such as in
classification, its capacity to estimate a specific signal vector is largely
unexplored. A major difficulty is that the hinge loss is just piecewise linear,
so that its ""curvature energy"" is concentrated in a single point. This is
substantially different from other popular loss functions considered in signal
estimation, e.g., the square or logistic loss, which are at least locally
strongly convex. It is therefore somewhat unexpected that we can still prove
very similar types of recovery guarantees for the hinge loss estimator, even in
the presence of strong noise. More specifically, our non-asymptotic error
bounds show that stable and robust reconstruction of $x_0$ can be achieved with
the optimal oversampling rate $O(m^{-1/2})$ in terms of the number of
measurements $m$. Moreover, we permit a wide class of structural assumptions on
the ground truth signal, in the sense that $x_0$ can belong to an arbitrary
bounded convex set $K \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. The proofs of our main results
rely on some recent advances in statistical learning theory due to Mendelson.
In particular, we invoke an adapted version of Mendelson's small ball method
that allows us to establish a quadratic lower bound on the error of the first
order Taylor approximation of the empirical hinge loss function.

neutron stars (NSs) and millisecond pulsars (MSPs). NSs origin and evolution
provide a useful information on stellar dynamics and evolution in star
clusters, and are among the most interesting astrophysical objects, being
precursors of several high-energy phenomena such as gravitational waves and
gamma-ray bursts. Due to a large velocity kick that they receive at birth, most
of the NSs escape the local field, affecting the evolution and dynamics of
their parent cluster. In this paper, we study the origin and dynamical
evolution of NSs within GCs with different initial masses, metallicities and
primordial binary fractions. We find that the radial profile of NSs is shaped
by the BH content of the cluster, which partially quenches the NS segregation
until most of the BHs are ejected from the system. Independently on the cluster
mass and initial configuration, the NSs map the average stellar population, as
their average radial distance is $\approx 60-80\%$ of the cluster half-mass
radius. Finally, by assuming a recycling fraction of $f_\mathrm{rec}=0.1$ and
an average MSP gamma-ray emission of $L_\gamma=2\times 10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$,
we show that the typical gamma-ray emission from our GCs agrees with
observations and supports the MSP origin of the gamma-ray excess signal
observed by the Fermi-LAT telescope in the Galactic Centre.

standard algorithms as they break down in an infinite dimensional setting, thus
the need for appropriate infinite dimensional samplers for implementing
probabilistic inference in such framework. In this paper, we introduce several

acceleration and underlying core dynamics are examined in new numerical
simulations of the geodynamo that reside on a theoretical path in parameter
space connecting the region where most classical models are found to the
natural conditions. The typical time scale for geomagnetic acceleration is
found to be invariant along this path, at a value close to 10 years that
matches Earth's core estimates. Despite this invariance, the spatio-temporal
properties of secular acceleration show significant variability along the path,
with an asymptotic regime of rapid rotation reached after 30% of this path
(corresponding to a model Ekman number $E=3~10^{-7}$). In this regime, the
energy of secular acceleration is entirely found at periods longer than that of
planetary rotation, and the underlying flow acceleration patterns acquire a
two-dimensional columnar structure representative of the rapid rotation limit.
The spatial pattern of the secular acceleration at the core-mantle boundary
shows significant localisation of energy within an equatorial belt. Rapid
hydromagnetic wave dynamics is absent at the start of the path but can be
clearly exhibited in the asymptotic regime. This study reports on ubiquitous
axisymmetric geostrophic torsional waves of weak amplitude relatively to
convective transport, and also stronger, laterally limited, quasi-geostrophic
Alfv\'en waves propagating in the cylindrical radial direction from the tip of
convective plumes towards the core-mantle boundary. Quasi-geostrophic Alfv\'en
waves are shown to be an important carrier of flow acceleration to the core
surface that links with the generation of strong, short-lived and intermittent
equatorial pulses in the secular acceleration energy.

  assessment of spatial interpolation methods",,,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Monthly precipitation climatologies at 1 km resolution have been produced
over the Norwegian mainland for 1981-2010. The observed station normals are
interpolated over a regular grid by applying a multi-linear local regression
kriging (MLRK). The statistical method aims at modeling the influence of the
main geographical features, such as: latitude, longitude, elevation and sea
nearness on the precipitation field at a local scale. The MLRK is composed of
two steps, (i) a background precipitation field is computed through a
multi-linear local regression based on the geographical information, then (ii)
a kriging interpolation is applied to adjust the field so to better fit the
station residuals (i.e., the difference between the observed normals and the
background field). The interpolation accuracy is evaluated by reconstructing
the station normals with a leave-one-out approach and by comparing the model
performances with those of other interpolation methods. The poor observation
coverage over remote and mountainous regions in Norway has motivated us to
consider precipitation fields produced by numerical models. In fact, numerical
model output provides a reference field for the evaluation of MLRK that is not
dependent on the station density, though it is not as accurate as the
observations. Specifically, a regional climate simulation with a resolution of
2.5 km, based on the dynamical downscaling of the global reanalysis ERAInterim
and available for the time period 2003-2016, has been used. In addition to the
MLRK validation, the combination of numerical model fields and observed
climatologies has been investigated and the results show that this integrated
approach provides more accurate high-resolution climatologies over the Country.
The numerical background introduces valuable information over remote and
mountainous regions, whereas in-situ data correct for model biases.

injections over a finite time horizon. The surplus dynamics obeys a linearly
controlled drifted Brownian motion that is reflected at the origin, dividends
give rise to time-dependent instantaneous marginal profits, whereas capital
injections are subject to time-dependent instantaneous marginal costs. The aim
is to maximize the sum of a liquidation value at terminal time and of the total
expected profits from dividends, net of the total expected costs for capital
injections. Inspired by the study of El Karoui and Karatzas (1989) on reflected
follower problems, we relate the optimal dividend problem with capital
injections to an optimal stopping problem for a drifted Brownian motion that is
absorbed at the origin. We show that whenever the optimal stopping rule is
triggered by a time-dependent boundary, the value function of the optimal
stopping problem gives the derivative of the value function of the optimal
dividend problem. Moreover, the optimal dividend strategy is also triggered by
the moving boundary of the associated stopping problem. The properties of this
boundary are then investigated in a case study in which instantaneous marginal
profits and costs from dividends and capital injections are constants
discounted at a constant rate.

radiation with varying amplitude and duration, but arriving at regular time
intervals. Unlike in previous template-based approaches, we present a
morphology-independent search method to find echoes in the data from

of generalized wavelets consisting of multiple sine-Gaussians. The ability of
the method to discriminate between echoes and instrumental noise is assessed by
inserting into the noise two different signals: a train of sine-Gaussians, and
an echoing signal from an extreme mass-ratio inspiral of a particle into a
Schwarzschild vacuum spacetime, with reflective boundary conditions close to
the horizon. We find that both types of signals are detectable for plausible

deterioration of horizontal link within the boundary layer is primarily caused

broadening under weak turbulence is negligible. Besides,we also found that
communication interruptions can also cause a perceptible key rate reduction

yet the capability to operate with large and high-dimensional datasets due to

reduction techniques such as manifold learning or autoencoder. However,
previous work often treats representation learning and anomaly prediction
separately. In this paper, we propose autoencoder based one-class support
vector machine (AE-1SVM) that brings OC-SVM, with the aid of random Fourier
features to approximate the radial basis kernel, into deep learning context by
combining it with a representation learning architecture and jointly exploit
stochastic gradient descent to obtain end-to-end training. Interestingly, this
also opens up the possible use of gradient-based attribution methods to explain
the decision making for anomaly detection, which has ever been challenging as a
result of the implicit mappings between the input space and the kernel space.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study the
interpretability of deep learning in anomaly detection. We evaluate our method
on a wide range of unsupervised anomaly detection tasks in which our end-to-end

larger than some critical values that depend on the initial kick-in speed. This
fact was then exploited to design tracks within the 2D waveguide array along

for many classes of signals (e.g., patches of natural images, segments of
speech signals, etc.). However, despite its popularity, very little is known
about the representation capacity of this model. In this paper, we study how
redundant a dictionary must be so as to allow any vector to admit a sparse
approximation with a prescribed sparsity and a prescribed level of accuracy. We
address this problem both in a worst-case setting and in an average-case one.
For each scenario we derive lower and upper bounds on the minimal required
overcompleteness. Our bounds have simple closed-form expressions that allow to
easily deduce the asymptotic behavior in large dimensions. In particular, we
find that the required overcompleteness grows exponentially with the sparsity
level and polynomially with the allowed representation error. This implies that
universal sparse representation is practical only at moderate sparsity levels,
but can be achieved at relatively high accuracy. As a side effect of our
analysis, we obtain a tight lower bound on the regularized incomplete beta
function, which may be interesting in its own right. We illustrate the validity

mechanical calculations to determine the mechanism responsible for
hydration-driven contraction in ZrW$_2$O$_8$. Inclusion of H$_2$O molecules
within the ZrW$_2$O$_8$ network drives the concerted formation of new W--O
bonds to give one-dimensional (--W--O--)$_n$ strings. The topology of the
ZrW$_2$O$_8$ network is such that there is no unique choice for the string
trajectories: the same local changes in coordination can propagate with a large
number of different periodicities. Consequently, ZrW$_2$O$_8$ is heavily
disordered, with each configuration of strings forming a dense aperiodic
`spaghetti'. This new connectivity contracts the unit cell \emph{via} large
shifts in the Zr and W atom positions. Fluctuations of the undistorted parent
structure towards this spaghetti phase emerge as the key NTE phonon modes in
ZrW$_2$O$_8$ itself. The large relative density of NTE phonon modes in
ZrW$_2$O$_8$ actually reflect the degeneracy of volume-contracting spaghetti
excitations, itself a function of the particular topology of this remarkable
material.

synchronised hair, a family of solutions of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system
that continuously connects to vacuum Kerr BHs. We identify the region in
parameter space wherein a global isometric embedding in Euclidean 3-space,
$\mathbb{E}^3$, is possible for the horizon geometry of the hairy BHs. For the
Kerr case, such embedding is possible iff the horizon dimensionless spin $j_H$
(which equals the total dimensionless spin, $j$), the sphericity $\mathfrak{s}$
and the horizon linear velocity $v_H$ are smaller than critical values, $j^{\rm

Thus the latter quantity provides the most faithful diagnosis for the existence

demonstrate that, comparing with the classic and state-of-the-art (distributed)

oxygen vacancies (VOs) in TiO2 anatase was investigated with Scanning Tunneling
Microscopy (STM). At the anatase (101) surface VOs are not stable; they migrate
into the bulk at temperatures above 200 K. Scanning a clean anatase (101)
surface at a sample bias greater than +4.3 V results in surface VOs in the
scanned area, suggesting that subsurface VOs migrate back to the surface. To
test this hypothesis, surface VOs were first created through bombardment with
energetic electrons. The sample was then mildly annealed, which caused the VOs
to move to the subsurface region, where they formed vacancy clusters. These VO
clusters have various, distinct shapes. Scanning VO clusters with a high STM
bias reproducibly converts them back into groupings of surface VO, with a
configuration that is characteristic for each type of cluster. The dependence
of the subsurface-to-surface VO migration on the applied STM bias voltage,
tunneling current, and sample temperature was investigated systematically. The
results point towards a key role of energetic, 'hot' electrons in this process.

Alon et al. [SICOMP 1995], are a natural graph-theoretic object. In recent
years, they have found significant applications in solvers for symmetric
diagonally dominant (SDD) linear systems. In this work, we provide the first
dynamic algorithm for maintaining such trees under edge insertions and
deletions to the input graph. Our algorithm has update time $ n^{1/2 + o(1)} $
and the average stretch of the maintained tree is $ n^{o(1)} $, which matches
the stretch in the seminal result of Alon et al.
  Similar to Alon et al., our dynamic low-stretch tree algorithm employs a
dynamic hierarchy of low-diameter decompositions (LDDs). As a major building
block we use a dynamic LDD that we obtain by adapting the random-shift
clustering of Miller et al. [SPAA 2013] to the dynamic setting. The major
technical challenge in our approach is to control the propagation of updates
within our hierarchy of LDDs: each update to one level of the hierarchy could
potentially induce several insertions and deletions to the next level of the
hierarchy. We achieve this goal by a sophisticated amortization approach.
  We believe that the dynamic random-shift clustering might be useful for
independent applications. One of these applications is the dynamic spanner
problem. By combining the random-shift clustering with the recent spanner
construction of Elkin and Neiman [SODA 2017]. We obtain a fully dynamic
algorithm for maintaining a spanner of stretch $ 2k - 1 $ and size $ O (n^{1 +
1/k} \log{n}) $ with amortized update time $ O (k \log^2 n) $ for any integer $

exo-Earths in giant planet systems has become intriguing. In this work, we aim
to address the question of the possible long-term coexistence of a terrestrial
companion on an orbit interior to a giant planet, and explore the extent of the
stability regions for both non-resonant and resonant configurations. Our study
focuses on the restricted three-body problem, where an inner terrestrial planet
(massless body) moves under the gravitational attraction of a star and an outer
massive planet on a circular or elliptic orbit. Using the Detrended Fast
Lyapunov Indicator as a chaotic indicator, we constructed maps of dynamical
stability by varying both the eccentricity of the outer giant planet and the
semi-major axis of the inner terrestrial planet, and identify the boundaries of
the stability domains. Guided by the computation of families of periodic
orbits, the phase space is unravelled by meticulously chosen stable periodic
orbits, which buttress the stability domains. We provide all possible stability
domains for coplanar symmetric configurations and show that a terrestrial
planet, either in mean-motion resonance or not, can coexist with a giant
planet, when the latter moves on either a circular or an (even highly)
eccentric orbit. New families of symmetric and asymmetric periodic orbits are
presented for the 2/1 resonance. It is shown that an inner terrestrial planet
can survive long time spans with a giant eccentric outer planet on resonant
symmetric orbits, even when both orbits are highly eccentric. For 22 detected
single-planet systems consisting of a giant planet with high eccentricity, we
discuss the possible existence of a terrestrial planet. This study is
particularly suitable for the research of companions among the detected systems
with giant planets, and could assist with refining observational data.

We identified six groups that categorise HII regions by common morphologies. We
confirmed the validity of these groupings by bootstrap re-sampling and the
ordinance technique multidimensional scaling. We then investigated associations
between physical parameters and the assigned groups. Location is mostly
independent of group, with a small preference for regions of similar longitudes
to share common morphologies. The shapes are homogeneously distributed across
Galactocentric distance and latitude. One group contains regions that are all
younger than 0.5 Myr and ionised by low- to intermediate-mass sources. Those in
another group are all driven by intermediate- to high-mass sources. One group
was distinctly separated from the other five and contained regions at the
surface brightness detection limit for the survey. We find that our
hierarchical procedure is most sensitive to the spatial sampling resolution
used, which is determined for each region from its distance. We discuss how
these errors can be further quantified and reduced in future work by utilising
synthetic observations from numerical simulations of HII regions. We also
outline how this shape analysis has further applications to other diffuse

multi-area power system taking into account of unknown time-varying power
imbalance. Particularly, fast controllable loads are utilized to restore system
frequency under changing power imbalance in an optimal manner. The imbalanced
power causing frequency deviation is decomposed into three parts: a known
constant part, an unknown low-frequency variation and a high-frequency
residual. The known steady part is usually the prediction of power imbalance.
The variation may result from the fluctuation of renewable resources, electric
vehicle charging, etc., which is usually unknown to operators. The
high-frequency residual is usually unknown and treated as an external
disturbance. Correspondingly, in this paper, we resolve the following three
problems in different timescales: 1) allocate the steady part of power
imbalance economically; 2) mitigate the effect of unknown low-frequency power
variation locally; 3) attenuate unknown high-frequency disturbances. To this
end, a distributed controller combining consensus method with adaptive internal
model control is proposed. We first prove that the closed-loop system is
asymptotically stable and converges to the optimal solution of an optimization
problem if the external disturbance is not included. We then prove that the
power variation can be mitigated accurately. Furthermore, we show that the
closed-loop system is robust against both parameter uncertainty and external
disturbances. The New England system is used to verify the efficacy of our
design.

The period of the shorter-period QPP drifts from about 12 to 25 seconds during
the flare. The observed properties of this QPP are consistent with a sausage
oscillation of a plasma loop in the flaring active region. The period of the
longer-period QPP is about 4 to 5 minutes. Its properties are compatible with

short-period QPP signal typical of solar flares along with a long-period QPP
signal more typical of stellar flares suggests that the different ranges of QPP

objective of this study is to propose a cost-effective approach for reducing
delay in the semi-actuated coordinated signal operation without incurring any
extra costs in terms of installing new detectors or developing adaptive
controller systems. We propose a simple approach for further enhancing a
pre-optimized timing plan. In this method, the green splits of non-coordinated
phases are multiplied by a factor greater than one. In the meantime, the amount
of green time added to the non-coordinated phases is subtracted from the
coordinated phases to keep the cycle length constant. Thus, if the traffic
demand on the side streets exceeds the expected traffic flow, the added time in
the non-coordinated phase enables the non-coordinated phases to accommodate the
additional traffic demand. A regression analysis is implemented so as to
identify the optimal value of the mentioned factor, called Actuated Factor
(ActF). The response variable is the average delay reduction (seconds/vehicle)
of the simulation runs under the proposed signal timing plan compared to the
simulation runs under the pre-optimized timing plan, obtained through the
macroscopic signal optimization tools. External traffic movements, left-turn
percentage, and ActF are the explanatory variables in the model. Results reveal
that the ActF is the only significant variable with the optimal value of 1.15

was lifted by the discovery of the improved two-stream technique, where the
accuracy of the scattering greenhouse effect is matched to that of multi-stream
calculations by construction. In the present study, we derive the full
solutions for improved two-stream radiative transfer, following its

solutions comes in the form of a correction factor, traditionally set to unity,
which is the ratio of a pair of first Eddington coefficients. We derive an
analytical expression for this correction factor and also provide a simple
fitting function for its ease of use by other workers. We prove that the direct
stellar beam is associated with a second Eddington coefficient that is on the
order of unity. Setting this second Eddington coefficient to 2/3 and
$1/\sqrt{3}$ reproduces the Eddington and quadrature closures, respectively,
associated with the direct beam. We use our improved two-stream solutions for
the fluxes to derive two-stream source function solutions for both the

only those patches that contain the landmark according to classification are
used to determine the landmark location. The landmark location is obtained by
calculating the average landmark location using the computed 3D displacement

by IceCube, has opened a new era in the field of neutrino physics. Up to now
the events detected are still without any source counterpart. The detected
events are compatible with the standard picture of cosmic neutrinos undergoing
3-flavor neutrino oscillations. We analyze the implications of neutrino
oscillations for the present and future experiments, focusing particularly on
tau neutrinos. In fact tau neutrinos are very important: even if they are not
produced in astrophysical sites, they have to exist due to oscillations and
their observation should be regarded as a basic proof in support of this
scenario. Moreover, IceCube's measurement of the flux of muon neutrinos implies
that the flux of tau neutrinos is measured within $20\%$, just assuming
standard neutrino oscillations. On this basis, after discussing the
experimental signatures of tau neutrinos, we predict the rates for $\nu_\tau$
detection in the present and future neutrino telescopes. We show that the
present IceCube detector is close to observe the first tau neutrinos, with a
probability of about 90\%. Moreover the next generation of IceCube can identify
about 2 neutrinos per year, reaching an evidence of 5$\sigma$ in about 10
years, despite the present uncertainty on the spectrum and on the production
mechanism. The non observation of these neutrino events would have dramatic
implications, such as the questioning of cosmic neutrino observations or the

ensuring that the physical energy balance is maintained at the discrete level.
As a result, unconditional stability with respect to the time step choice is
ensured by the implicit treatment of interface conditions within the Stokes
substeps, whereas the coupling between Stokes and ODE substeps is enforced via
appropriate initial conditions for each substep. Notably, unconditional
stability is attained without the need of subiterating between Stokes and ODE
substeps. Stability and convergence properties of the proposed algorithm are

traversed by the probe. Our approach is inspired by the finger slip studies and
adapts the idea of load-slip phenomenon that explains the movement of the soft
part of the finger when dragged on a hard surface. We propose the concept of
loading-distance and perform measurements on beef liver and chicken breast
tissues. We propose a protocol to determine the loading-distance prior to an
automated scan and introduce an approach to compensate the tissue movement in
raster scans. Our implementation and experiments show that we can have an
image-mosaic of the tissue surface in a desired rectangular shape with this
approach.

  reconstruction at low sampling ratios","5 pages. Accepted by ICASSP2018",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The compressed sensing (CS) has been successfully applied to image
compression in the past few years as most image signals are sparse in a certain
domain. Several CS reconstruction models have been proposed and obtained
superior performance. However, these methods suffer from blocking artifacts or
ringing effects at low sampling ratios in most cases. To address this problem,
we propose a deep convolutional Laplacian Pyramid Compressed Sensing Network
(LapCSNet) for CS, which consists of a sampling sub-network and a
reconstruction sub-network. In the sampling sub-network, we utilize a
convolutional layer to mimic the sampling operator. In contrast to the fixed
sampling matrices used in traditional CS methods, the filters used in our
convolutional layer are jointly optimized with the reconstruction sub-network.
In the reconstruction sub-network, two branches are designed to reconstruct
multi-scale residual images and muti-scale target images progressively using a
Laplacian pyramid architecture. The proposed LapCSNet not only integrates
multi-scale information to achieve better performance but also reduces
computational cost dramatically. Experimental results on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of reconstructing more details
and sharper edges against the state-of-the-arts methods.

magnetospheric accretion and a disk wind. We found a good match between
observed signatures of accreting gas, wind features, and rotational velocities

At this orientation the trajectories of infalling gas just above the stellar

the statistic is not related to any particular model. This algorithm controls
the number of false change point detections in the case where the trajectory is
fully Brownian. A Monte Carlo study is proposed to demonstrate the performances
of the method and also to compare the procedure to two competitive algorithms.

to produce optimal assignments, such that the average waiting time at

sub-optimal assignments, we propose a method that offers resilience to
uncertainty by making use of redundant robots. However, solving the redundant
assignment problem optimally is strongly NP-hard. Hence, we exploit structural

polynomial-time, near-optimal solution. We demonstrate that our problem can be
reduced to minimizing a supermodular cost function subject to a matroid
constraint. This allows us to develop a greedy algorithm, for which we derive
sub-optimality bounds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with
simulations on transport networks, where uncertain edge costs and uncertain

algorithms show that our method performs near-optimally and significantly
better than non-redundant assignment. Finally, our findings include results on

datasets that include expert manual segmentation are scarce as this step is
time-consuming, and therefore expensive. Moreover, single-rater manual
annotation is most often used in data-driven approaches making the network
optimal with respect to only that single expert. In this work, we propose a CNN
for brain extraction in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, that is fully trained
with what we refer to as silver standard masks. Our method consists of 1)
developing a dataset with ""silver standard"" masks as input, and implementing
both 2) a tri-planar method using parallel 2D U-Net-based CNNs (referred to as
CONSNet) and 3) an auto-context implementation of CONSNet. The term CONSNet
refers to our integrated approach, i.e., training with silver standard masks
and using a 2D U-Net-based architecture. Our results showed that we
outperformed (i.e., larger Dice coefficients) the current state-of-the-art SS
methods. Our use of silver standard masks reduced the cost of manual
annotation, decreased inter-intra-rater variability, and avoided CNN
segmentation super-specialization towards one specific manual annotation
guideline that can occur when gold standard masks are used. Moreover, the usage
of silver standard masks greatly enlarges the volume of input annotated data
because we can relatively easily generate labels for unlabeled data. In
addition, our method has the advantage that, once trained, it takes only a few
seconds to process a typical brain image volume using modern hardware, such as
a high-end graphics processing unit. In contrast, many of the other competitive
methods have processing times in the order of minutes.

two, and also resolve substructure in the stream at these apocenters. Here we
present dynamical models that reproduce these features of the stream in simple
Galactic potentials. We find that debris at the apocenters must be dynamically
young, in the sense of being stripped off in the last two pericentric passages,
while the Sagittarius dwarf is currently experiencing a third passage. The
ratio of apocenters is sensitive to both dynamical friction and the outer slope
of the Galactic rotation curve. These dependences can be understood with simple
regularities connecting the apocentric radii, circular velocities, and orbital
period of the progenitor. The effect of dynamical friction on the stream can be
constrained using substructure within the leading apocenter. Our ensembles of
models are not intended as statistically proper fits to the stream.
Nevertheless, out of the range of models we consider, we consistently find the
mass within 100 kpc to be $\sim 7 \times 10^{11} \, M_{\odot}$, with a nearly
flat rotation curve between 50 and 100 kpc. This points to a more extended
Galactic halo than assumed in some current models. As in previous work, we find
prolate or triaxial halos ease agreement with the track of the leading stream.
We display the behavior of our models in various observational spaces and
characterize the substructure expected within the stream. In particular, the
young trailing stream visible near trailing apocenter should exhibit a tight
trend of velocity with distance separate from the older debris, and we suggest
that this will serve as an especially useful probe of the outer Galactic
potential.

  Our next contribution is in using the connectivity of random annulus graphs

still a challenging task for medical image analysis. In this work, we present
the spatially region-weighted correlation ratio (SRWCR) as a novel similarity

deduced from a three-dimension joint probability density function combining the
intensity channels with an extra spatial information channel. SRWCR estimates
the optimal functional dependence between the intensities for each spatial bin,
in which the spatial distribution modeled by a cubic B-spline function is used
to differentiate the contribution of voxels. We also analytically derive the
gradient of SRWCR with respect to the transformation parameters and optimize it

mathematical challenges when building right endpoint controllers due to the

$R$ is the Ricci scalar, $T$, the trace of energy-momentum tensor and $\lambda$
is a constant, we derive a general function of Hubble parameter with bulk
viscous form to provide a procedure for the viscous new HDE model building.
Especially, we assume the total bulk viscosity coefficient proportional to the
velocity of the expansion of the universe in such a way that
$\zeta=\zeta_0+\zeta_1 H$. We obtain the solutions of the scale factor and
deceleration parameter and classify all the possible scenarios (deceleration,
acceleration and their transition) with different parameter regions chosen
properly for positive and negative ranges of $\lambda$, and $\zeta_0$ and
$\zeta_1$ to analyze the evolution of the universe. It is observed that there
is a transition from decelerated phase to accelerated phase at early or late
time depending on the values of viscous terms. For large values of viscous
terms it always accelerates through out the evolution. Furthermore, we also
investigate the statefinder pair $\{r, s\}$ and $\textit{Om}$ diagnostics for
the viscous new HDE model to discriminate with other existing DE models. Our
viscous model is also different from other existing dark energy models. The
evolution of effective equation of state parameter is -0.9745 which is very
close to the observation. The entropy and generalized second law of
thermodynamics are valid for this model under some constraints of bulk viscous
coefficient. The analysis shows that the dark energy phenomena may be explained

neck. It captures the signals that are transmitted through the vocal folds,
along with the buzz tone of the larynx. Due to its skin contact, it is more
robust to the environmental noise compared to the acoustic microphone that
picks up the vibrations through air pressure, and hence the all interventions.
The throat speech is partly intelligible, but gives unnatural and croaky sound.
This thesis tries to recover missing frequency bands of the throat speech and
investigates envelope and excitation mapping problem with joint analysis of
throat- and acoustic-microphone recordings. A new phone-dependent GMM-based
spectral envelope mapping scheme, which performs the minimum mean square error
(MMSE) estimation of the acoustic-microphone spectral envelope, has been
proposed. In the source-filter decomposition framework, we observed that the
spectral envelope difference of the excitation signals of throat- and
acoustic-microphone recordings is an important source of the degradation in the
throat-microphone voice quality. Thus, we also model spectral envelope
difference of the excitation signals as a spectral tilt vector, and propose a
new phone-dependent GMM-based spectral tilt mapping scheme to enhance throat
excitation signal. Experimental evaluations are performed to compare the
proposed mapping scheme using both objective and subjective evaluations.
Objective evaluations are performed with the log-spectral distortion (LSD) and
the wide-band perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) metrics.
Subjective evaluations are performed with A/B pair comparison listening test.
Both objective and subjective evaluations yield that the proposed
phone-dependent mapping consistently improves performances over the

the empirically established imperative of increasing entropy production,
nucleic acids with affinity to particular amino acids which foment UVC photon
dissipation would have been ""thermodynamically selected"" through this
dissipation-replication relation. Indeed, we show here that those amino acids
with characteristics most relevant to fomenting UVC photon dissipation are
precisely those with greatest affinity to their codons or anticodons. This
could provide a physical-chemical mechanism for the accumulation of information
in nucleic acids relevant to the dissipation of the externally imposed photon
potential. This mechanism could provide a non-equilibrium thermodynamic
foundation, based on increasing global entropy production of the biosphere, for
the tenants of Darwinian natural selection. We show how this mechanism might

development assistance (ODA) on economic growth in WAEMU zone countries. To
achieve this, the study is based on OECD and WDI data covering the period
1980-2015 and used Hansen's Panel Threshold Regression (PTR) model to
""bootstrap"" aid threshold above which its effectiveness is effective. The
evidence strongly supports the view that the relationship between aid and
economic growth is non-linear with a unique threshold which is 12.74% GDP.
Above this value, the marginal effect of aid is 0.69 points, ""all things being
equal to otherwise"". One of the main contribution of this paper is to show that
WAEMU countries need investments that could be covered by the foreign aid. This
later one should be considered just as a complementary resource. Thus, WEAMU
countries should continue to strengthen their efforts in internal resource
mobilization in order to fulfil this need.

hollow cylinder subjected to uniform magnetic field and inner-pressurized loads
are studied. Rather than directly assuming the material constants into some
certain function forms as displayed in previous researches, we firstly give the
volume fractions of different constituents of the FGM cylinder and then
determine the expressions of material constants. By the use of the Voigt method
the corresponding analytical solutions of displacements in radical direction,
the strain and stress components and the perturbation magnetic field vector are
derived by the following. In numerical part, the influences of volume fraction
on displacement, stain and stress components and the magnetic perturbation
filed vector are investigated; indicated by the results, we can conclude that
the Poisson's ratio has a significant effect on the FGM cylinder's mechanical
behaviors. Moreover, by some appropriate choices of the material constants it
can be found that the obtained results in this paper can reduce to some special
cases given in previous literatures.

equity in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) workforce.
Serious concerns about low minority participation call for a rigorous
evaluation of new pedagogical methods that effectively prepares
underrepresented groups for the increasingly digital world. The inability to
achieve STEM workforce diversity goals is attributed to the failure of the
academic pipeline to maintain a steady flow of underrepresented minority
students. Formal curriculum frequently results in under-preparedness and a
professional practices gap. Exacerbating lower performance are fragile
communities where issues such as poverty, single-parent homes, incarceration,
abuse, and homelessness disengage residents. Since data shows that more
minorities have computing and engineering degrees than work in the field, this
discussions explores how educational institutions can critically examine social
and political realities that impede STEM diversity while capturing cultural
cues that identify personal barriers amongst underrepresented groups.

electrohydrodynamically driven emulsion of oil droplets in an immiscible oil
medium, where the amplitude and frequency of an external electric field are the
control parameters. In the weakly-driven electrohydrodynamic regime, the
droplets are trapped dielectrophoretically on a patterned electrode, and the
driving is therefore spatially varying. We find excellent agreement with a
$\langle x^2 \rangle \sim t^{1.5}$ power law, and find that this superdiffusive
dynamics arises from an underlying displacement distribution that is distinctly
non-Gaussian, and exponential for small displacements and short times. While
these results are comparable with a random-velocity field model, the tracer
particle speeds are in fact spatially varying in 2 dimensions, arising from a
spatially varying electrohydrodynamic driving force. This suggests that the
important ingredient for the super-diffusive $t^{1.5}$ behaviour observed is a
velocity field that is isotropic in the plane and spatially correlated.
Finally, we can extract, from the superdiffusive dynamics, a experimental
lengthscale that corresponds to the lateral range of the hydrodynamic flows.
This experimental length scale is only non-zero above a threshold ion mobility
length.

as specific. Their unique technology content, the type of founders and managers
they have, the amount of venture capital they raise, the time it takes them to
reach an exit as well as the technology clusters they belong to are seen as
such unique features. Based on extensive research from new databases, the
author claims that the biotechnology startups are not as different as it might
have been claimed: the amount of venture capital raised, the time to exit,
their geography are indeed similar and even their equity structure to founders
and managers have similarities. The differences still exist, for example the
experience of the founders, the revenue and profit level at exit.
