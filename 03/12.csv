because the provided privacy can be quantified by means such as differential
privacy. However, recovering and analyzing statistics involving multiple
dependent randomized binary attributes can be difficult, posing a significant
barrier to use. In this work, we address this problem by identifying and
analyzing a family of response randomizers that change each binary attribute
independently with the same probability. Modes of Google's Rappor randomizer as
well as applications of two well-known classical randomized response methods,
Warner's original method and Simmons' unrelated question method, belong to this
family. We show that randomizers in this family transform multinomial
distribution parameters by an iterated Kronecker product of an invertible and
bisymmetric $2 \times 2$ matrix. This allows us to present a simple and
efficient algorithm for obtaining unbiased maximum likelihood parameter
estimates for $k$-way marginals from randomized responses and provide
theoretical bounds on the statistical efficiency achieved. We also describe the
efficiency - differential privacy tradeoff. Importantly, both randomization of
responses and the estimation algorithm are simple to implement, an aspect
critical to technologies for privacy protection and security.

consequence, a comprehensive study of the effects of irradiation-induced

required. The effects of irradiation on ductile fracture mechanisms - void

Pure copper thin tensile samples have been irradiated with protons up to 0.01

subjected to uniaxial loading conditions allow a detailed description of void
growth and coalescence. In this study, experimental data show that physical
mechanisms of micron-scale void growth and coalescence are similar between the
unirradiated and irradiated copper. However, an acceleration of void growth is
observed in the later case, resulting in earlier coalescence, which is
consistent with the decrease of fracture toughness reported in irradiated
materials. These results are qualitatively reproduced with numerical
simulations accounting for irradiation macroscopic hardening and decrease of
strain-hardening capability.

it possible to explore some potentially important relationships between the

It is also shown that the peak power of the rotors designed optimally for a

rotors designed for a different farm (i.e. 'untuned' rotors) even if the blade
pitch angle is allowed to be adjusted optimally during the operation. The
results presented are for ideal very large wind farms and a possible future
extension of the present work for real large wind farms is also discussed

assess the impact of selection bias on a typical Mendelian randomization
investigation. Selection bias had a severe impact on bias and Type 1 error
rates in our simulation study, but only when selection effects were large. For
moderate effects of the risk factor on selection, bias was generally small and
Type 1 error rate inflation was not considerable. The magnitude of bias was
also affected by the strength of confounder-risk factor and confounder-outcome
associations, the structure of the causal diagram and selection frequency. The
use of inverse probability weighting ameliorated bias when the selection model

studied under additional interactions such as an external Zeeman field (with
strength $K$) in $x$-direction, a inter-molecular interaction (with strength
$J_1$) and a dipole-dipole interaction with strength $J_2$ such that
$K>J_1>J_2$. The effect of dipole-dipole interaction removes the local $Z_2$
symmetry and gives rise to four global degenerate states with Ferroeletric
order. Using meanfield analysis we chart out the phase diagram for classical
version of the model and find $K_c$ which defines the transition from
disordered phase to ordered phase in $J_1, K$ plane for various values of
$J_2$. We find that presence of $J_1$ and $J_2$ tends to stabilize the
deconfined phases. Over the classical ground states we perform spin-wave
analysis and surprisingly find that quantum fluctuations does not remove the
classical degeneracy at all at quadratic level. The spin-wave spectrum is found
for the four global degenerate ground states which shows both gapped spectrum
and gapless spectrum (near the vicinity of CDT transition) for $J_2=0$. However
for $J_2$ finite, the spectrum is always gapped. We perform PCUT analysis to
improve the results of spin-wave analysis and calculate ground state energy and
one particle dispersion and gap at high symmetry point. Using this we draw the
phase boundary between confined and deconfined phase in the $K-J_1$ plane. The
effect of $J_2$ is also discussed in the resulting phase boundary.

the linear stability of the Schwarzschild family of black hole solutions to the
Einstein vacuum equations was established by imposing a double null gauge. In
this paper we shall prove that the Schwarzschild family is linearly stable as
solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations by imposing instead a generalised
wave gauge: all sufficiently regular solutions to the system of equations that
result from linearising the Einstein vacuum equations, as expressed in a
generalised wave gauge, about a fixed Schwarzschild solution remain uniformly
bounded on the Schwarzschild exterior region and in fact decay to a member of
the linearised Kerr family. The dispersion is at an inverse polynomial rate and
therefore in principle sufficient for future nonlinear applications. The result
thus fits into the wider goal of establishing the full nonlinear stability of
the exterior Kerr family as solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations by
employing a generalised wave gauge and therefore complements \cite{D-H-R} in a
similar vein as the pioneering work \cite{L-R} of Lindblad and Rodnianski

Neutron diffraction measurements show that the magnetic ground state of
YbRh3Si7 is a collinear antiferromagnet where the moments are aligned in the ab
plane. With such an ordered state, no metamagnetic transitions are expected
when a magnetic field is applied along the c axis. It is therefore surprising
that high field magnetization, torque, and resistivity measurements with H||c
reveal two metamagnetic transitions at mu_0H_1 = 6.7 T and mu_0H_2 = 21 T. When
the field is tilted away from the c axis, towards the ab plane, both
metamagnetic transitions are shifted to higher fields. The first metamagnetic
transition leads to an abrupt increase in the electrical resistivity, while the
second transition is accompanied by a dramatic reduction in the electrical
resistivity. Thus, the magnetic and electronic degrees of freedom in YbRh3Si7
are strongly coupled. We discuss the origin of the anomalous metamagnetism and
conclude that it is related to competition between crystal electric field
anisotropy and anisotropic exchange interactions.

problem with similarity information by introducing multiple and possibly
conflicting objectives. Since the best arm in each objective can be different
given the context, learning the best arm based on a single objective can
jeopardize the rewards obtained from the other objectives. In order to evaluate
the performance of the learner in this setup, we use a performance metric
called the contextual Pareto regret. Essentially, the contextual Pareto regret
is the sum of the distances of the arms chosen by the learner to the context
dependent Pareto front. For this problem, we develop a new online learning
algorithm called Pareto Contextual Zooming (PCZ), which exploits the idea of
contextual zooming to learn the arms that are close to the Pareto front for
each observed context by adaptively partitioning the joint context-arm set
according to the observed rewards and locations of the context-arm pairs
selected in the past. Then, we prove that PCZ achieves $\tilde O
(T^{(1+d_p)/(2+d_p)})$ Pareto regret where $d_p$ is the Pareto zooming
dimension that depends on the size of the set of near-optimal context-arm
pairs. Moreover, we show that this regret bound is nearly optimal by providing
an almost matching $\Omega (T^{(1+d_p)/(2+d_p)})$ lower bound.

zero or merely astronomically small---acts as a de facto limit. In order to
eliminate the confusion surrounding the issue, we propose the adoption of the

outputs are often longer than their workspace. This leads to the question: how
can we reproduce the results of a randomized log space computation without
storing the output or randomness verbatim? Running the algorithm again with new
random bits may result in a new (and potentially different) output.
  We show that every problem in search-RL has a randomized log-space algorithm
where the output can be reproduced. Specifically, we show that for every
problem in search-RL, there are a pair of log-space randomized algorithms A and
B where for every input x, A will output some string t_x of size O(log n), such
that B when running on (x, t_x) will be pseudo-deterministic: that is, running
B multiple times on the same input (x, t_x) will result in the same output on
all executions with high probability. Thus, by storing only O(log n) bits in
memory, it is possible to reproduce the output of a randomized log-space
algorithm.
  An algorithm is reproducible without storing any bits in memory (i.e.,
|t_x|=0) if and only if it is pseudo-deterministic. We show
pseudo-deterministic algorithms for finding paths in undirected graphs and
Eulerian graphs using logarithmic space. Our algorithms are substantially
faster than the best known deterministic algorithms for finding paths in such
graphs in log-space.
  The algorithm for search-RL has the additional property that its output, when
viewed as a random variable depending on the randomness used by the algorithm,
has entropy O(log n).

sets about common entities. They aim to learn a linear model over the whole set
of features. This problem of federated learning over vertically partitioned
data includes a crucial upstream issue: entity resolution, i.e. finding the
correspondence between the rows of the datasets. It is well known that entity
resolution, just like learning, is mistake-prone in the real world. Despite the
importance of the problem, there has been no formal assessment of how errors in
entity resolution impact learning.
  In this paper, we provide a thorough answer to this question, answering how
optimal classifiers, empirical losses, margins and generalisation abilities are
affected. While our answer spans a wide set of losses --- going beyond proper,
convex, or classification calibrated ---, it brings simple practical arguments
to upgrade entity resolution as a preprocessing step to learning. One of these
suggests that entity resolution should be aimed at controlling or minimizing
the number of matching errors between examples of distinct classes. In our
experiments, we modify a simple token-based entity resolution algorithm so that
it indeed aims at avoiding matching rows belonging to different classes, and
perform experiments in the setting where entity resolution relies on noisy
data, which is very relevant to real world domains. Notably, our approach
covers the case where one peer \textit{does not} have classes, or a noisy
record of classes. Experiments display that using the class information during
entity resolution can buy significant uplift for learning at little expense
from the complexity standpoint.

diameter $D>0$. Only attainable values of $D$ are relevant, for which
$D^2=a^2+b^2+ab$, $a, b \in\mathbb{Z}$ (L\""oschian numbers). Depending on
arithmetic properties of $D^2$, we identify, for large fugacities, the pure
phases (extreme Gibbs measures) and specify their symmetries. The answers
depend on the way(s) an equilateral triangle of side-length $D$ can be
inscribed in $\mathbb{A}_2$ or $\mathbb{H}_2$. On $\mathbb{A}_2$, our approach
works for all attainable $D^2$; on $\mathbb{H}_2$ we have to exclude $D^2 = 4,
7, 31, 133$, where a sliding phenomenon occurs, similar to that on a unit
square lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$. For all values $D^2$ apart from the excluded
ones we prove the existence of a first-order phase transition where the number
of co-existing pure phases grows at least as $O(D^2)$.
  The proof is based on the Pirogov--Sinai theory which requires non-trivial
verifications of key assumptions: finiteness of the set of periodic ground
states and the Peierls bound. To establish the Peierls bound, we develop a
general method based on the concept of a re-distributed area for Delaunay
triangles. Some of the presented proofs are computer-assisted.
  As a by-product of the ground state identification, we solve the disk-packing

phenomenon in relativistic systems has receivedlittle attention as compared to
the Newtonian case. Here, we focus our work on the study of some relevant
characteristics of the exit basin topology in the relativistic H\'enon-Heiles
system: the uncertainty dimension, the Wada property and the basin entropy. Our
main findings for the uncertainty dimension show two different behaviors
insofar we change the relativistic parameter $\beta$, in which a crossover
behavior is uncovered. This crossover point is related with the disappearance
of KAM islands in phase space that happens for velocity values above the
ultra-relativistic limit, $v>0.1c$. This result is supported by numerical
simulations and also by qualitative analysis, which are in good agreement. On
the other hand, the computation of the exit basins in the phase space suggests
the existence of Wada basins for a range of $\beta<0.625$. We also studied the
evolution of the exit basins in a quantitative manner by computing the basin
entropy, which shows a maximum value for $\beta \approx 0.2$. This last
quantity is related to the uncertainty in the prediction of the final fate of
the system. Finally, our work is relevant in galactic dynamics and it also has
important implications in other topics in physics as in the St\""ormer problem,

B-F stars as a function of their dereddened color. These stars are located on
the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram relative to the isochrones with a high
accuracy. This has allowed me to conclude that the reddening and extinction
were significantly underestimated in some kinematic studies of other authors.
The median accuracy of the velocity components U, V, W in this study is 1.7
km/s, although outside the range $-0.1<(B_T-V_T)_0<0.5$ the kinematic
characteristics are noticeably biased due to the incompleteness of the sample.
We have confirmed the variations in the mean velocity of stars relative to the

known from the Hipparcos data. Given the age estimates for the stars under
consideration from the TRILEGAL model and the Geneva-Copenhagen survey, these
variations may be considered as variations as a function of the age. A
comparison of our results with the results of other studies of the stellar
kinematics near the Sun has shown that selection and reddening underestimation
explain almost completely the discrepancies between the results. The
dispersions and mean velocities from the results of reliable studies fit into a
$\pm2$ km/s corridor, while the ratios $\sigma_V/\sigma_U$ and
$\sigma_W/\sigma_U$ fit into $\pm0.05$. Based on all reliable studies in the
range $-0.1<(B_T-V_T)_0<0.5$, i.e., for an age from 0.23 to 2.4 Gyr, we have
found that the stellar velocity dispersions in km/s are proportional to the age

complex wave-function in which spin and orbital angular momenta are entangled
due to relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Such a localized electronic
state carries an effective total angular momentum of $J_{eff}=1/2$. In
materials with an edge-sharing octahedral crystal structure, such as the
honeycomb iridates Li2IrO3 and Na2IrO3, these $J_{eff}=1/2$ moments are
expected to be coupled through a special bond-dependent magnetic interaction,
which is a necessary condition for the realization of a Kitaev quantum spin
liquid. However, this relativistic electron picture is challenged by an
alternate description, in which itinerant electrons are confined to a
benzene-like hexagon, keeping the system insulating despite the delocalized
nature of the electrons. In this quasi-molecular orbital (QMO) picture, the
honeycomb iridates are an unlikely choice for a Kitaev spin liquid. Here we
show that the honeycomb iridate Li2IrO3 is best described by a $J_{eff}=1/2$
state at ambient pressure, but crosses over into a QMO state under the
application of small (~ 0.1 GPa) hydrostatic pressure. This result illustrates
that the physics of iridates is extremely rich due to a delicate balance

pattern, normalized with respect to a reference interference-free system with
unlimited transceiver cache capabilities. The objective is to design the
schemes for cache placement and file delivery in order to minimize the NDT. To
this end, we establish a novel converse and two types of achievability schemes
applicable to both time-variant and invariant channels. The first scheme is a
general one-shot scheme for any $M$ and $K$ that synergistically exploits both
multicasting (coded) caching and distributed zero-forcing opportunities. We
show that the proposed one-shot scheme (i) attains gains attributed to both
individual and collective transceiver caches (ii) is NDT-optimal for various
parameter settings, particularly at higher cache sizes. The second scheme, on
the other hand, designs beamformers to facilitate both subspace interference
alignment and zero-forcing at lower cache sizes. Exploiting both schemes, we
are able to characterize for various special cases of $M$ and $K$ which satisfy
$K+M\leq 4$ the optimal tradeoff between cache storage and latency. The
tradeoff illustrates that the NDT is the preferred choice to capture the
latency of a system rather than the commonly used sum degrees-of-freedom (DoF).
In fact, our optimal tradeoff refutes the popular belief that increasing cache

designs the Golden-Frame (GF) group coding structure through the use of
stillness detection. Our new approach hence develops an automatic stillness

the setting where only a single task is available. The method is formalized as
pseudo-task augmentation, in which models are trained with multiple decoders
for each task. Pseudo-tasks simulate the effect of training towards
closely-related tasks drawn from the same universe. In a suite of experiments,
pseudo-task augmentation is shown to improve performance on single-task
learning problems. When combined with multitask learning, further improvements
are achieved, including state-of-the-art performance on the CelebA dataset,
showing that pseudo-task augmentation and multitask learning have complementary
value. All in all, pseudo-task augmentation is a broadly applicable and
efficient way to boost performance in deep learning systems.

new heights, allowing robots to operate with high performance in conditions
that were previously unimaginable. The majority of the work, however, assumes
that the unknown parts are static or slowly changing. This limits them to
static or slowly changing environments. However, in the real world, a robot may
experience various unknown conditions. This paper presents a method to extend
an existing single mode GP-based safe learning controller to learn an
increasing number of non-linear models for the robot dynamics. We show that
this approach enables a robot to re-use past experience from a large number of
previously visited operating conditions, and to safely adapt when a new and
distinct operating condition is encountered. This allows the robot to achieve
safety and high performance in an large number of operating conditions that do
not have to be specified ahead of time. Our approach runs independently from
the controller, imposing no additional computation time on the control loop

demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in experiment on a 900\,kg ground

the set of sensors is divided into multiple clusters where the value of the

cluster transmit their sensing information to the local fusion center (LFC) of
their corresponding cluster, where using some fusion rule, the received
information is combined, and then possibly sent to a higher-level central
fusion center (CFC). A two-phase processing scheme is also envisioned, in which
the first phase is dedicated to detection in the LFC, and the second phase is
dedicated to estimation in both the LFC and the CFC. The focus of the present
paper is on the problem of decision fusion at the LFC: we propose hard- and
soft-decision maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithms, which exhibit flexibility
in minimizing the total cost imposed by incorrect detections in the first
phase. The proposed algorithms are simulated and compared with conventional
fusion techniques. It is shown that the proposed techniques result in lower
cost. Furthermore, when the number of sensors or the amount of contamination
increases, the performance gap between the proposed algorithms and the existing

semigroup having the Lindblad superoperator as a generator. This generator may
have an eigenfunction with a unity eigenvalue, referred to as a constant of
motion (COM). An open quantum system has a unique stationary state if and only
if it has no COMs. A system with multiple stationary states has a basis of
COMs; any COM of the system is a linear combination of the basis COMs. The
basis divides the space of system states into subspaces. Each subspace has its
own stationary state, and any stationary state of the system is a linear
combination of these states. Usually, neither the basis of COMs nor even the
number of COMs is known. We demonstrate that finding the stationary state of
the system does not require looking for the COMs. Instead, one can construct a
set of invariant subspaces. If the system evolution begins from one of these
subspaces, the system will remain in it, arriving at a stationary state
independent of evolution in other subspaces. We suggest a direct way of finding
the invariant subspaces by studying the evolution of the system. We show that
the sets of invariant subspaces and subspaces generated by the basis of COMs
are equivalent. A stationary state of the system is a weighted sum of
stationary states in each invariant subspace; the weighted factors are
determined by the initial state of the system.

essentially different from the symmetrical coupling case. The single photons
propagating towards the emitter in opposite directions show different
transmission behaviors, which is a manifestation of the single-photon diode. In
the ideal chiral coupling case, the transmission probability of the single
photon transport in one direction is zero by critical coupling, while in the
opposite direction it is unity. The diode works well only when the

diode works well when the single photon is nearly resonant to the emitter. For
a $\Lambda $-type three-level emitter, when the single-photon frequency is

(TDNRG) formalism for multiple quenches and implement it to study the response
of a quantum impurity system to a general pulse. Within this approach, we
reduce the contribution of the NRG approximation to numerical errors in the
time evolution of observables by a formulation that avoids the use of the
generalized overlap matrix elements in our previous multiple-quench TDNRG
formalism [Nghiem {\em et al.,} Phys. Rev. B {\bf 89}, 075118 (2014); Phys.
Rev. B {\bf 90}, 035129 (2014)]. We demonstrate that the formalism yields a
smaller cumulative error in the trace of the projected density matrix as a
function of time and a smaller discontinuity of local observables between
quenches than in our previous approach. Moreover, by increasing the switch-on
time, the time between the first and last quench of the discretized pulse, the
long-time limit of observables systematically converges to its expected value
in the final state, i.e., the more adiabatic the switching, the more accurately
is the long-time limit recovered. The present formalism can be
straightforwardly extended to infinite switch-on times. We show that this
yields highly accurate results for the long-time limit of both thermodynamic
observables and spectral functions, and overcomes the significant errors within
the single quench formalism [Anders {\em et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 95},

potential for guiding experiments to new discoveries. We present an overview of
some of our recent developments and discuss challenges that lie ahead. Our foci
include: (1) strong interactions derived from chiral effective field theory;
(2) advances in solving the large sparse matrix eigenvalue problem on
leadership-class supercomputers; (3) selected observables in light nuclei with
the JISP16 interaction; (4) effective electroweak operators consistent with the

developed to reconstruct a background image from cluttered scenes.
Traditionally, statistical measures and existing image quality techniques have
been applied for evaluating the quality of the reconstructed background images.
Though these quality assessment methods have been widely used in the past,
their performance in evaluating the perceived quality of the reconstructed

Background image Quality Index (RBQI) that combines color and structural
information at multiple scales using a probability summation model to predict
the perceived quality in the reconstructed background image given a reference

image quality assessment measures, we construct two different datasets
consisting of reconstructed background images and corresponding subjective
scores. The quality assessment measures are evaluated by correlating their
objective scores with human subjective ratings. The correlation results show
that the proposed RBQI outperforms all the existing approaches. Additionally,
the constructed datasets and the corresponding subjective scores provide a
benchmark to evaluate the performance of future metrics that are developed to
evaluate the perceived quality of reconstructed background images.

discriminative features from rich deformation of face shapes and poses. Besides
the variance of faces themselves, the intrinsic variance of image styles, e.g.,
grayscale vs. color images, light vs. dark, intense vs. dull, and so on, has
constantly been overlooked. This issue becomes inevitable as increasing web
images are collected from various sources for training neural networks. In this
work, we propose a style-aggregated approach to deal with the large intrinsic
variance of image styles for facial landmark detection. Our method transforms
original face images to style-aggregated images by a generative adversarial
module. The proposed scheme uses the style-aggregated image to maintain face
images that are more robust to environmental changes. Then the original face
images accompanying with style-aggregated ones play a duet to train a landmark
detector which is complementary to each other. In this way, for each face, our
method takes two images as input, i.e., one in its original style and the other
in the aggregated style. In experiments, we observe that the large variance of
image styles would degenerate the performance of facial landmark detectors.
Moreover, we show the robustness of our method to the large variance of image
styles by comparing to a variant of our approach, in which the generative
adversarial module is removed, and no style-aggregated images are used. Our
approach is demonstrated to perform well when compared with state-of-the-art

$H_0$ plays a very important role in the consistency test of $\Lambda$CDM with
the $H(z)$ data. Adopting the Hubble constant priors from \textit{Planck} 2013

the others. However, with the Hubble constant prior taken from WMAP9, the
discrepancy between $H(z)$ data and $\Lambda$CDM disappears, i.e., the current
$H(z)$ observations still support the cosmological constant scenario. This
conclusion is also supported by the results derived from the JLA SNe Ia sample.
The best-fit Hubble constant from the combination of $H(z)$+JLA

phase of some luminous gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) could arise from the cascade
induced by interactions between accelerated protons and the radiation field of
GRBs. The photomeson process, which is usually suggested to operate in such a
hadronic explanation, requires a rather high proton energy (> 10^17eV) for an
efficient interaction. However, whether GRBs can accelerate protons to such a
high energy is far from guaranteed, although they have been suggested as the
candidate source for ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays. In this work, we revisit the
hadronic model for the prompt high-energy emission of GRBs with a smaller
maximum proton energy than the usually adopted value estimated from the Bohm
condition. In this case, the Bethe-Heitler pair production process becomes
comparably important or even dominates over the photomeson process. We show
that with a relatively low maximum proton energy with a Lorentz factor of 10^5
in the comoving frame, the cascade emission can still reproduce various types
of high-energy spectrum of GRBs. For most GRBs without high-energy emission
detected, the maximum proton energy could be even lower and relax the
constraints on the parameters of GRB jet resulting from the fact of
non-detection of GRB neutrinos by IceCube.

datasets, as index searches degrade with increasing dimension (i.e., the curse
of dimensionality). Thus, we target the low dimensionality problem, and compare
our GPU self-join to a search-and-refine implementation, and a state-of-the-art
parallel algorithm. In low dimensionality, there are several unique challenges
associated with efficiently solving the self-join problem on the GPU. Low
dimensional data often results in higher data densities, causing a significant
number of distance calculations and a large result set. As dimensionality
increases, index searches become increasingly exhaustive, forming a performance
bottleneck. We advance several techniques to overcome these challenges using
the GPU. The techniques we propose include a GPU-efficient index that employs a
bounded search, a batching scheme to accommodate large result set sizes, and a
reduction in distance calculations through duplicate search removal. Our GPU
self-join outperforms both search-and-refine and state-of-the-art algorithms.

get the structure theorem for it. For this purpose, we first introduce a class
of 1-Lipschitz functions, each member of which is called an {\it almost
distance function}. Typical examples of an almost distance function are the
distance function from a point and the Busemann function on a complete
Riemannian manifold. The generalized notion of the cut locus in this paper is
called the {\it singular locus} of an almost distance function. The singular
locus consists of the upper one and the lower one. The upper singular locus
coincides with the cut locus of a point for the distance function from the
point, and the lower singular locus coincides with the set of all copoints of a
ray when the almost distance function is the Busman function of the ray.
Therefore, it is possible to treat the cut locus of a closed subset and the set
of copoints of a ray in a unified way by introducing the singular locus for the
almost distance function. In this article, we obtain the structure theorem
(Theorem B) for the singular locus of an almost distance function on a
2-dimensional Finsler manifold that contains both structure theorems ([S],
Theorem B) and [Sa,Theorem 2.13]) for the cut locus and the set of copoints of
a ray as a corollary.

semantic image retrieval problems in computer vision. In the light of recent
progress, convolutional neural network based hashing methods typically seek
pair-wise or triplet labels to conduct the similarity preserving learning.
However, complex semantic concepts of visual contents are hard to capture by
similar/dissimilar labels, which limits the retrieval performance. Generally,
pair-wise or triplet losses not only suffer from expensive training costs but
also lack in extracting sufficient semantic information. In this regard, we
propose a novel deep supervised hashing model to learn more compact class-level
similarity preserving binary codes. Our deep learning based model is motivated
by deep metric learning that directly takes semantic labels as supervised
information in training and generates corresponding discriminant hashing code.
Specifically, a novel cubic constraint loss function based on Gaussian
distribution is proposed, which preserves semantic variations while penalizes
the overlap part of different classes in the embedding space. To address the
discrete optimization problem introduced by binary codes, a two-step
optimization strategy is proposed to provide efficient training and avoid the
problem of gradient vanishing. Extensive experiments on four large-scale
benchmark databases show that our model can achieve the state-of-the-art
retrieval performance. Moreover, when training samples are limited, our method
surpasses other supervised deep hashing methods with non-negligible margins.

triangular array setting is used to cover various patterns of spatial data.
Conditional spatial heteroscedasticity and non-identically distributed
observations and a linear process for disturbances are assumed, allowing
various spatial dependencies. The estimation procedure is a combination of a
weighted likelihood and a generalized method of moments. The procedure first
fixes the parametric components of the model and then estimates the
non-parametric part using weighted likelihood; the obtained estimate is then
used to construct a GMM parametric component estimate. The consistency and
asymptotic distribution of the estimators are established under sufficient
conditions. Some simulation experiments are provided to investigate the finite

$\theta_{13}$ is very small. A simple $\mu\leftrightarrow\tau$ exchange
symmetry of the neutrino mass matrix predicts $\theta_{23}=-\pi/4$ and
$\theta_{13}=0$. Since the experimental measurements differ from these
predictions, this symmetry is obviously broken. This breaking is given by two
parameters: $\varepsilon_1$ parametrizing the inequality bewteen $12$ and $13$
elements and $\varepsilon_2$ parametrizing the inequality bewteen $22$ and $33$
elements. We show that the magnitude of $\theta_{13}$ is essentially controlled
by $\varepsilon_1$ whereas the deviation of $\theta_{23}$ from maximality is
controlled by $\varepsilon_2$. The measured value of $\theta_{13}$ requires
$\mu\leftrightarrow\tau$ symmetry to be badly broken for both normal hierarchy
and inverted hierarchy, though the level of breaking depends sensitively on the
hierarchy. In this paper we obtain constraints on the parameters of neutrino
mass matrix, including the symmetry breaking parameters, using the precision

neutrino mass matrix to be in very narrow ranges. We also consider
$\mu\leftrightarrow -\tau$ exchange symmetry in the case of inverted hierarchy

biaxial strain dependence of electronic structures and transport properties of
Janus TMD MXY (M = Mo or W, X/Y = S, Se, or Te) monolayer by using generalized
gradient approximation (GGA) plus spin-orbit coupling (SOC). It is found that
SOC has a noteworthy detrimental influence on power factor in p-type MoSSe,
WSSe, n-type WSTe, p-type MoSeTe and WSeTe, and has a negligible influence on
one in n-type MoSSe, MoSTe, p-type WSTe and n-type MoSeTe. These can be
understood by considering SOC effects on their valence and conduction bands.
For all six monolayers, the energy band gap firstly increases, and then
decreases, when strain changes from compressive one to tensile one. It is found
that strain can tune strength of bands convergence of both valence and
conduction bands by changing the numbers and relative position of valence band
extrema (VBE) or conduction band extrema (CBE), which can produce very
important effects on their electronic transport properties. By applying
appropriate compressive or tensile strain, both n- or p-type Seebeck
coefficient can be enhanced by strain-induced band convergence, and then the
power factor can be improved. Our works further enrich studies on strain

exploring higher frequency bands above 6 GHz. At these frequencies, beamforming
appears as a straightforward solution to overcome higher path loss thereby
altering the Doppler characteristics of the received waves. Higher frequencies
can suffer from strong Doppler impairments because of the linear dependency of
Doppler shift with carrier frequency, which makes them challenging to use in
high-mobility scenarios, particularly Vehicular-to-Infrastructure (V2I)
communications. Therefore, the impact of beamforming on the Doppler
characteristics of the received signals is of utter importance for future V2I
systems. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the Doppler power
spectrum in the presence of beamforming at the transmit and/or the receive
sides. Further approximations are made for the resulting Doppler spread and
Doppler shift when the receive beam width is sufficiently small, and a possible
design solution is presented to control the Doppler spread in V2I systems. The
results can be of key importance in waveform and air interface design for V2I
systems.

involves the exchange of a public good in Pseudomonas populations, where the
iron-scavenging compound pyoverdine, synthesized by some cells, is shared with
the rest. Pyoverdine thus mediates interactions between producers and
non-producers and can constitute a public good. This interaction is often used
to test game theoretical predictions on the ""social dilemma"" of producers. Such
an approach, however, underestimates the impact of specific properties of the
public good, for example consequences of its accumulation in the environment.
Here, we experimentally quantify costs and benefits of pyoverdine production in
a specific environment, and build a model of population dynamics that
explicitly accounts for the changing significance of accumulating pyoverdine as
chemical mediator of social interactions. The model predicts that, in an
ensemble of growing populations (metapopulation) with different initial
producer fractions (and consequently pyoverdine contents), the global producer
fraction initially increases. Because the benefit of pyoverdine declines at
saturating concentrations, the increase need only be transient. Confirmed by

collective work practices across organizational boarders. A predominant way to
achieve better collaboration in large- scale heterogeneous contexts is to
establish an integrated and standardized technological infrastructure.
Ethnographically inspired studies, on the other hand, have challenged such
perspective and illustrated that generic technology does not fit in local
contexts and needs to be worked-around. Similarly, this paper empirically
exemplifies local workarounds and illustrates ongoing and persistently
imperfect integration of a collaborative infrastructure in a global oil and gas
company. More importantly, however, our analysis focuses on how integrated
technology is used across contexts. We illustrate how local workarounds, as a
result of tight technological integration, shape use patterns across contexts.
Integrated systems establish interdependencies across contexts, thus, the use
implies cross-contextual rather than local enactment. Since the trajectory of
enactment is influenced by cross-contextual constrains, our study is addressing
the existing overemphasis on studying/analysing the use of technology in
isolated local contexts. Practically, our study suggests considering
workarounds as an intrinsic part of every day work, which should be calculated
as additional costs of making the generic technology to work in practice.

through an optically created potential barrier are reinvigorating the
controversial debate regarding possible time-delays during light-induced
tunnelling of an electron from an atom. Compelling theoretical and experimental
arguments have been put forward to advocate opposite views, confirming or
refuting the existence of finite tunnelling time delays. Yet, such a delay,
whether present or not, is but a single quantity characterizing the tunnelling
wavepacket; the underlying dynamics are richer. Here we propose to augment
photo-electron detection in laser-induced tunnelling with detection of light
emitted by the tunnelling electron -- the so-called Brunel radiation. Using a
combination of single-color and two-color driving fields, we identify the
all-optical signatures of the re-shaping of the tunnelling wavepacket as it
emerges from the tunnelling barrier and moves away from the core. This
reshaping includes not only an effective time-delay but also time-reversal
asymmetry of the ionization process, which we describe theoretically and
observe experimentally. We show how both delay and reshaping are mapped on the
polarization properties of the Brunel radiation, with different harmonics
behaving as different hands of a clock moving at different speeds. The
all-optical detection paves the way to time-resolving optical tunnelling in
condensed matter systems, e.g. tunnelling across bandgaps in solids, on the

dynamic ripples in the atomically thin membrane. In this paper, we perform
modal analysis to estimate the effective macroscopic bending rigidity of
graphene membranes from the frequency spectrum of their Brownian motion. Our
method is based on fitting the resonance frequencies obtained from the Brownian
motion in molecular dynamics simulations, to those obtained from a continuum

this way, the effective bending rigidity of the membrane and its temperature
and size dependence, are extracted, while including the effects of dynamic
ripples and thermal fluctuations. The proposed method provides a framework for

Selecting the beamformer that maximizes the total average energy transfer
between the ET and the ERs, while satisfying a minimum harvested energy
criterion at each ER, is studied. This is a nonconvex constrained optimization
problem which is difficult to solve analytically. Also, any analytical solution
to the problem should only consists of parameters that the ET knows, or the ET
can estimate, as utilizing only RSSI feedback values for channel estimation
prohibits estimating some channel parameters. Thus, the paper focuses on
obtaining a suboptimal solution analytically. It is proven that if the channels
between the ET and the ERs satisfy a certain sufficient condition, this
solution is in fact optimal. Simulations show that the optimality gap is
negligibly small as well. Insights into a system with more than two ERs are
also presented. To this end, it is highlighted that if the number of ERs is
large enough, it is possible to always find a pair of ERs satisfying the
sufficient condition, and hence, a pairwise scheduling policy that does not
violate optimality can be used for the WET.

some soliton methods. The procedure involves three steps: (1) Find a `Lax

a Darboux-Backund dressing transformation for the Lax representation $i\dot
\rho=[H,f(\rho)]$, where $f$ models a time-dependent environment; (3) find a

there are specific subgraphs called network motifs that occur at frequencies
much higher than those found in randomized networks. Further understanding of
the designing principle of such networks is highly desirable. In a different
context, information thermodynamics has been developed as a theoretical
framework that generalizes non-equilibrium thermodynamics to stochastically
fluctuating systems with information. Here we systematically characterize gene
regulatory networks on the basis of information thermodynamics. We model
three-node gene regulatory patterns by a stochastic Boolean model, which
receive one or two input signals that carry external information. For the case
of a single input, we found that all the three-node patterns are classified
into four types by using information-thermodynamic quantities such as
dissipation and mutual information, and reveal to which type each network motif
belongs. Next, we consider the case where there are two inputs, and evaluate
the capacity of logical operation of the three-node patterns by using
tripartite mutual information, and argue the reason why patterns with fewer
edges are preferred in natural selection. This result might also explain the
difference of the occurrence frequencies among different types of
feedforward-loop network motifs.

minimal number of terms in expansions based on the kernel functions. Minimizing

based on minimizing the atomic norm is robust and stable, so it provides
controllable accuracy for recovery when the signal is only approximately sparse

dependence between the largest values of its components. When used as a

dependence properties of vectors with a random scale construction
$(X_1,X_2)=R(W_1,W_2)$, with non-degenerate $R>0$ independent of $(W_1,W_2)$.
Focusing on the presence and strength of asymptotic tail dependence, as
expressed through commonly-used summary parameters, broad factors that affect
the results are: the heaviness of the tails of $R$ and $(W_1,W_2)$, the shape
of the support of $(W_1,W_2)$, and dependence between $(W_1,W_2)$. When $R$ is
distinctly lighter tailed than $(W_1,W_2)$, the extremal dependence of
$(X_1,X_2)$ is typically the same as that of $(W_1,W_2)$, whereas similar or
heavier tails for $R$ compared to $(W_1,W_2)$ typically result in increased
extremal dependence. Similar tail heavinesses represent the most interesting
and technical cases, and we find both asymptotic independence and dependence of
$(X_1,X_2)$ possible in such cases when $(W_1,W_2)$ exhibit asymptotic
independence. The bivariate case often directly extends to higher-dimensional

from recent advances in Bayesian deep learning, and extends existing work by
considering the targeted crowdsourcing approach, where multiple annotators with
unknown expertise contribute an uncontrolled amount (often limited) of
annotations. Our framework leverages the low-rank structure in annotations to
learn individual annotator expertise, which then helps to infer the true labels
from noisy and sparse annotations. It provides a unified Bayesian model to
simultaneously infer the true labels and train the deep learning model in order
to reach an optimal learning efficacy. Finally, our framework exploits the
uncertainty of the deep learning model during prediction as well as the
annotators' estimated expertise to minimize the number of required annotations
and annotators for optimally training the deep learning model.

dynamics and evolution, notably by triggering hydrodynamical instabilities, by
interacting with the magnetic field, and more generally by inducing transport
of angular momentum and chemical elements. Moreover, it modifies the way waves
propagate in stellar interiors and thus the frequency spectrum of these waves,
the regions they probe, and the transport they generate.
  Aims. We investigate the impact of a general differential rotation (both in
radius and latitude) on the propagation of axisymmetric gravito-inertial waves.
  Methods. We use a small-wavelength approximation to obtain a local dispersion
relation for these waves. We then describe the propagation of waves thanks to a
ray model that follows a Hamiltonian formalism. Finally, we numerically probe
the properties of these gravito-inertial rays for different regimes of radial
and latitudinal differential rotation.
  Results. We derive a local dispersion relation that includes the effect of a
general differential rotation. Subsequently, considering a polytropic stellar
model, we observe that differential rotation allows for a large variety of
resonant cavities that can be probed by gravito-inertial waves. We identify
that for some regimes of frequency and differential rotation, the properties of
gravito-inertial rays are similar to those found in the uniformly rotating
case. Furthermore, we also find new regimes specific to differential rotation,
where the dynamics of rays is chaotic.
  Conclusions. As a consequence, we expect modes to follow the same trend. Some
parts of oscillation spectra corresponding to regimes similar to those of the
uniformly rotating case would exhibit regular patterns, while parts
corresponding to the new regimes would be mostly constituted of chaotic modes
with a spectrum rather characterised by a generic statistical distribution.

stores. It is provably the strongest model that tolerates partitions, it avoids
the long latencies associated with strong consistency, and, especially when
using read-only transactions, it prevents many of the anomalies of weaker
consistency models. Recent work has shown that causal consistency allows
""latency-optimal"" read-only transactions, that are nonblocking, single-version
and single-round in terms of communication. On the surface, this latency
optimality is very appealing, as the vast majority of applications are assumed
to have read-dominated workloads.
  In this paper, we show that such ""latency-optimal"" read-only transactions
induce an extra overhead on writes, the extra overhead is so high that
performance is actually jeopardized, even in read-dominated workloads. We show
this result from a practical and a theoretical angle.
  First, we present a protocol that implements ""almost laten- cy-optimal"" ROTs
but does not impose on the writes any of the overhead of latency-optimal
protocols. In this protocol, ROTs are nonblocking, one version and can be
configured to use either two or one and a half rounds of client-server
communication. We experimentally show that this protocol not only provides
better throughput, as expected, but also surprisingly better latencies for all
but the lowest loads and most read-heavy workloads.
  Then, we prove that the extra overhead imposed on writes by latency-optimal
read-only transactions is inherent, i.e., it is not an artifact of the design
we consider, and cannot be avoided by any implementation of latency-optimal
read-only transactions. We show in particular that this overhead grows linearly
with the number of clients.

sub-wavelength unit cells, have recently attracted enormous attention for their
powerful control over electromagnetic waves, from microwave to visible range.
With tunability added to the unit cells, the programmable metasurfaces enable
us to benefit from multiple unique functionalities controlled by external

of programmable metasurfaces and elaborate on different approaches to realize
them, with the tunability from global aspects, to local aspects, and to
software-defined metasurfaces.

  models",,,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stochastic process models are now commonly used to analyse complex
biological, ecological and industrial systems. Increasingly there is a need to
deliver accurate estimates of model parameters and assess model fit by
optimizing the timing of measurement of these processes. Standard methods to
construct Bayes optimal designs, such as the well known \Muller algorithm, are
computationally intensive even for relatively simple models. A key issue is
that, in determining the merit of a design, the utility function typically
requires summaries of many parameter posterior distributions, each determined
via a computer-intensive scheme such as MCMC. This paper describes a fast and
computationally efficient scheme to determine optimal designs for stochastic
process models. The algorithm compares favourably with other methods for
determining optimal designs and can require up to an order of magnitude fewer
utility function evaluations for the same accuracy in the optimal design
solution. It benefits from being embarrassingly parallel and is ideal for
running on multi-core computers. The method is illustrated by determining
different sized optimal designs for three problems of increasing complexity.

the APEX 12-m telescope, demonstrating our initial claim that the software
principles were directly transposable to scan observations made with other

redundancy. This document explains how the algorithm was modified to cope with
the specificities of ArT\'eMiS observations and with the atmospheric emission
at 350 and 450 $\mu$m, far dominating the instrumental drifts that were the
only low-frequency noise component in Herschel data. Like in the original
software, this was accomplished without assuming any noise model and without
applying any Fourier-space filtering, by exploiting the redundancy built in the
observations - taking advantage of the fact that each portion of the sky is
sampled at multiple times by multiple bolometers. It remains an interactive
software in the sense that the user is allowed to optionally visualize and
control results at each intermediate step, but the processing is fully
automated. It has been grafted onto the ArT\'eMiS pipeline, in charge of the
formatting, calibration and projection of the data, that is described

Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) management plays an important role on
the performance of SDN. However, previous literatures, in point of view on rule
placement strategies, are still insufficient to provide high scalability for
processing large flow sets with a limited TCAM size. So caching is a brand new
method for TCAM management which can provide better performance than rule
placement. In this paper, we propose FDRC, an efficient flow-driven rule
caching algorithm to optimize the cache replacement in SDN-based networks.
Different from the previous packet-driven caching algorithm, FDRC is
characterized by trying to deal with the challenges of limited cache size
constraint and unpredictable flows. In particular, we design a caching
algorithm with low-complexity to achieve high cache hit ratio by prefetching
and special replacement strategy for predictable and unpredictable flows,
respectively. By conducting extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our
proposed caching algorithm significantly outperforms FIFO and least recently

0.6-18 times of Neptune mass and orbital periods less than 3 days - turned out
to be very small. The corresponding region in the mass-period distribution was
assigned as the ""short-period Neptunian desert"". The common explanation of this
fact is that the gaseous planet with few Neptune masses would not survive in
the vicinity of host star due to intensive atmosphere outflow induced by
heating from stellar radiation. To check this hypothesis we performed numerical
simulations of atmosphere dynamics for a hot Neptune. We adopt the previously

short-period Neptunes could not be entirely explained by evaporation of planet
atmosphere caused by the radiation from a host star. For the less massive
Neptune-like planet, the estimated upper limits of the mass loss may be
consistent with the photo-evaporation scenario, while the heavier Neptune-like
planets could not lose the significant mass through this mechanism. We also
found the significant differences between our numerical results and widely used

system size. This transition has much in common with that on random regular
graphs. We further perform a detailed analysis of the inverse participation
ratio (IPR) of many-body wavefunctions, exploring how ergodic behavior in the
delocalized phase switches to fractal one at the critical point and on the
localized side of the transition. Our analytical results for the scaling of the
critical disorder $W$ with the system size $L$ and for the scaling of IPR in
the delocalized and localized phases are supported and corroborated by exact
diagonalization of spin chains.

also exhibit enrichments at mass 50, most likely due in part to $^{50}$Ti, but
close-to-normal or depleted $^{53}$Cr/$^{52}$Cr ratios. There is a strong
inverse relationship between $^{54}$Cr enrichment and grain size; the most
extreme grains are all <80 nm in diameter. Comparison of the isotopic data with
predictions of nucleosynthesis calculations indicate that these grains most
likely originated in either rare, high-density Type Ia supernovae (SNIa), or in
electron-capture supernovae (ECSN) which may occur as the end stage of
evolution for stars of mass 8-10 M$_\odot$. This is the first evidence for
preserved presolar grains from either type of supernova. An ECSN origin is
attractive since these likely occur much more frequently than high-density
SNIa, and their evolutionary timescales ($\sim$20 Myr) are comparable to those
of molecular clouds. Self-pollution of the Sun's parent cloud from an ECSN may
explain the heterogeneous distribution of n-rich isotopic anomalies in
planetary materials, including a recently reported dichotomy in Mo isotopes in
the solar system. The stellar origins of three grains with solar
$^{54}$Cr/$^{52}$Cr, but anomalies in $^{50}$Cr or $^{53}$Cr, as well as of a
grain enriched in $^{57}$Fe, are unclear.

datasets is a central problem for a wide range of applications. Solutions
addressing this problem usually rely on spatial indexing and on the computation
of a similarity measure in polynomial time. Although effective in the context
of sparse trajectory datasets, this approach is too expensive in the context of
dense datasets, where many trajectories potentially match with a given query.
In this paper, we apply fingerprinting, a copy-detection mechanism used in the
context of textual data, to trajectories. To this end, we fingerprint
trajectories with geodabs, a construction based on geohash aimed at trajectory
fingerprinting. We demonstrate that by relying on the properties of a space
filling curve geodabs can be used to build sharded inverted indexes. We show
how normalization affects precision and recall, two key measures in information
retrieval. We then demonstrate that the probabilistic nature of fingerprinting
has a marginal effect on the quality of the results. Finally, we evaluate our
method in terms of performances and show that, in contrast with existing
methods, it is not affected by the density of the trajectory dataset and that
it can be efficiently distributed.

sensitive to the velocity/potential of the sources as well as the potential
along the line-of-sight through the mapping from real space to redshift space
(redshift-space distortions, RSD). Since odd multipoles of the halo
cross-correlation function vanish when considering standard Doppler RSD, the
dipole is a sensitive probe of relativistic and wide-angle effects. We build a
catalogue of ten million haloes (Milky-Way size to galaxy-cluster size) from
the full-sky light-cone of a new ""RayGalGroupSims"" N-body simulation which
covers a volume of ($2.625~h^{-1}$Gpc)$^3$ with $4096^3$ particles. Using
ray-tracing techniques, we find the null geodesics connecting all the sources
to the observer. We then self-consistently derive all the relativistic
contributions (in the weak-field approximation) to RSD: Doppler, transverse
Doppler, gravitational, lensing and integrated Sachs-Wolfe. It allows us, for
the first time, to disentangle all contributions to the dipole from linear to
non-linear scales. At large scale, we recover the linear predictions dominated
by a contribution from the divergence of neighbouring line-of-sights. While the
linear theory remains a reasonable approximation of the velocity contribution
to the dipole at non-linear scales it fails to reproduce the potential
contribution below $30-60~h^{-1}$Mpc (depending on the halo mass). At scales
smaller than $\sim 10~h^{-1}$Mpc, the dipole is dominated by the asymmetry
caused by the gravitational redshift. The transition between the two regimes is
mass dependent as well. We also identify a new non-trivial contribution from
the non-linear coupling between potential and velocity terms.

Submitted to JAI",,,,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In radio interferometry, the quantization process introduces a bias in the
magnitude and phase of the measured correlations which translates into errors
in the measurement of source brightness and position in the sky, affecting both
the system calibration and image reconstruction. In this paper we investigate
the biasing effect of quantization in the measured correlation between
complex-valued inputs with a circularly symmetric Gaussian probability density
function (PDF), which is the typical case for radio astronomy applications. We
start by calculating the correlation between the input and quantization error
and its effect on the quantized variance, first in the case of a real-valued
quantizer with a zero mean Gaussian input and then in the case of a
complex-valued quantizer with a circularly symmetric Gaussian input. We
demonstrate that this input-error correlation is always negative for a
quantizer with an odd number of levels, while for an even number of levels this
correlation is positive in the low signal level regime. In both cases there is
an optimal interval for the input signal level for which this input-error
correlation is very weak and the model of additive uncorrelated quantization
noise provides a very accurate approximation. We determine the conditions under
which the magnitude and phase of the measured correlation have negligible bias
with respect to the unquantized values: we demonstrate that the magnitude bias
is negligible only if both unquantized inputs are optimally quantized (i.e.,
when the uncorrelated quantization error model is valid), while the phase bias
is negligible when 1) at least one of the inputs is optimally quantized, or
when 2) the correlation coefficient between the unquantized inputs is small.
Finally, we determine the implications of these results for radio
interferometry.

simultaneously. Our regions begin with both clustered and extended
distributions of stars, and a gas distribution which can include a filamentary
structure in addition to gas surrounding the stellar subclusters. We find that
the regions become spherical, monolithic, and smooth quite quickly, and that
the dynamical evolution is dominated by the gravitational interactions between
the stars. In the absence of stellar feedback, the gas moves gently out of the
centre of our regions but does not have a significant impact on the motions of
the stars at the earliest stages of cluster formation. Our models at later
times are consistent with observations of similar regions in the local

relatively insensitive to reasonable choices of initial conditions. Models with
more realism, such as an initial population of binary and multiple stars and
ongoing star formation, are the next step needed to confirm these findings.

function for artificial neural networks. In this paper we consider two basic
learning problems assuming that the underlying data follow a generative model
based on a ReLU-network -- a neural network with ReLU activations. As a
primarily theoretical study, we limit ourselves to a single-layer network. The
first problem we study corresponds to dictionary-learning in the presence of
nonlinearity (modeled by the ReLU functions). Given a set of observation
vectors $\mathbf{y}^i \in \mathbb{R}^d, i =1, 2, \dots , n$, we aim to recover
$d\times k$ matrix $A$ and the latent vectors $\{\mathbf{c}^i\} \subset
\mathbb{R}^k$ under the model $\mathbf{y}^i = \mathrm{ReLU}(A\mathbf{c}^i
+\mathbf{b})$, where $\mathbf{b}\in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a random bias. We show
that it is possible to recover the column space of $A$ within an error of
$O(d)$ (in Frobenius norm) under certain conditions on the probability
distribution of $\mathbf{b}$.
  The second problem we consider is that of robust recovery of the signal in
the presence of outliers, i.e., large but sparse noise. In this setting we are
interested in recovering the latent vector $\mathbf{c}$ from its noisy
nonlinear sketches of the form $\mathbf{v} = \mathrm{ReLU}(A\mathbf{c}) +
\mathbf{e}+\mathbf{w}$, where $\mathbf{e} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ denotes the
outliers with sparsity $s$ and $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ denote the dense
but small noise. This line of work has recently been studied (Soltanolkotabi,
2017) without the presence of outliers. For this problem, we show that a
generalized LASSO algorithm is able to recover the signal $\mathbf{c} \in
\mathbb{R}^k$ within an $\ell_2$ error of $O(\sqrt{\frac{(k+s)\log d}{d}})$

flow of given velocity. This process is modeled by a viscous convective
Cahn-Hilliard system, which consists of two nonlinearly coupled second-order
partial differential equations for the unknown quantities, the chemical
potential and an order parameter representing the scaled density of one of the
phases. In contrast to other contributions, in which zero Neumann boundary
conditions were are assumed for both the chemical potential and the order
parameter, we consider the case of dynamic boundary conditions, which model the
situation when another phase transition takes place on the boundary. The phase
transition processes in the bulk and on the boundary are driven by free
energies functionals that may be nondifferentiable and have derivatives only in
the sense of (possibly set-valued) subdifferentials. For the resulting
initial-boundary value system of Cahn-Hilliard type, general well-posedness
results have been established in a recent contribution by the same authors. In
the present paper, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the solutions as
times approaches infinity. More precisely, we study the $\omega$-limit (in a
suitable topology) of every solution trajectory. Under the assumptions that the
viscosity coefficients are strictly positive and that at least one of the
underlying free energies is differentiable, we prove that the $\omega$-limit is
meaningful and that all of its elements are solutions to the corresponding
stationary system, where the component representing the chemical potential is a

  http://gonglab.pratt.duke.edu/code-data",,,,"cs.CR cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sybil detection in social networks is a basic security research problem.
Structure-based methods have been shown to be promising at detecting Sybils.
Existing structure-based methods can be classified into Random Walk (RW)-based
methods and Loop Belief Propagation (LBP)-based methods. RW-based methods
cannot leverage labeled Sybils and labeled benign users simultaneously, which
limits their detection accuracy, and/or they are not robust to noisy labels.
LBP-based methods are not scalable and cannot guarantee convergence. In this
work, we propose SybilSCAR, a novel structure-based method to detect Sybils in
social networks. SybilSCAR is Scalable, Convergent, Accurate, and Robust to
label noise. We first propose a framework to unify RW-based and LBP-based
methods. Under our framework, these methods can be viewed as iteratively
applying a (different) local rule to every user, which propagates label
information among a social graph. Second, we design a new local rule, which
SybilSCAR iteratively applies to every user to detect Sybils. We compare
SybilSCAR with state-of-the-art RW-based and LBP-based methods theoretically
and empirically. Theoretically, we show that, with proper parameter settings,
SybilSCAR has a tighter asymptotical bound on the number of Sybils that are
falsely accepted into a social network than existing structure-based methods.
Empirically, we perform evaluation using both social networks with synthesized
Sybils and a large-scale Twitter dataset (41.7M nodes and 1.2B edges) with real
Sybils. Our results show that 1) SybilSCAR is substantially more accurate and
more robust to label noise than state-of-the-art RW-based methods; 2) SybilSCAR
is more accurate and one order of magnitude more scalable than state-of-the-art
LBP-based methods.

these states, allowing for further structural insights to be gained using
concepts from random matrix theory, approach first exploited in this study. For
generating random matrices that are appropriate as a structureless reference,
we propose a null model that enforces, on average, the empirical occurrence
frequency of each possible trait. With respect to this null model, the
empirical matrices show deviating eigenvalues, which may be signatures of
subtle cultural groups. However, they can conceivably also be artifacts of
arbitrary redundancies between cultural variables. We first study this
possibility in a highly simplified setting, using a toy model that enforces a
certain level of redundancy in a minimally-biased way, in parallel with another
toy model that enforces group structure. By analyzing and comparing cultural
states generated with these toy models, we show that a deviating eigenvalue can
indeed be a redundancy signature, which can be distinguished from a grouping
signature by evaluating the uniformity of the entries of the respective
eigenvector, as well as the uniformity-based compatibility with the null model.
For empirical data, the eigenvector uniformities of all deviating eigenvalues
are shown to be compatible with the null model, apparently suggesting that we
are not dealing with genuine group structure. However, we demonstrate that some
deviating eigenvalues might actually be due to authentic groups that are
internally non-uniform. A generic procedure for distinguishing such groups from
redundancy artifacts requires further research.

they capture some essential feature of research practice in mathematics. Holes
die when a subset of their concepts appear in the same article, hence their
death may be a sign of the creation of new knowledge, as we show with some
examples. We find a positive relation between the dimension of a hole and the
time it takes to be closed: larger holes may represent potential for important
advances in the field because they separate conceptually distant areas. We also
show that authors' conceptual entropy is positively related with their
contribution to homological holes, suggesting that polymaths tend to be on the

studies the problems of topology and parameter estimation in radial balanced

how the relational probability amplitude matrix is transformed and how mutual
information is exchanged during measurement, we derive the formulation that is
mathematically equivalent to the traditional quantum measurement theory. More
importantly, the formulation results in significant conceptual consequences. We
show that for a given quantum system, it is possible to describe its time
evolution without explicitly calling out a reference system. However,
description of a quantum measurement must be explicitly relative. Traditional
quantum mechanics assumes a super observer who can instantaneously know the
measurement results from any location. For a composite system consists
space-like separated subsystems, the assumption of super observer must be
abandoned and the relational formulation of quantum measurement becomes
necessary. This is confirmed in the resolution of EPR paradox. Information
exchange is relative to a local observer in quantum mechanics. Different local
observers can achieve consistent descriptions of a quantum system if they are
synchronized on the information regarding outcomes from any measurement
performed on the system. It is suggested that the synchronization of
measurement results from different observers is a necessary step when combining
quantum mechanics with the relativity theory.

use of the contour, we obtain a complete set of eigenstates, including both
free states and bound states. These states constitute a larger Hilbert space
than described by the standard String hypothesis. We calculate the density and
noise correlations of several quenched systems such as a static or kinetic
impurity evolving in an array of particles.

repertoire of vegetarians. This challenge can be partially overcome by
quantitative, data-driven approaches that utilise massive nutritional
information collected for many different foods. Based on large-scale data of
foods' nutrient compositions, the recent concept of nutritional fitness helps
quantify a nutrient balance within each food with regard to satisfying daily
nutritional requirements. Nutritional fitness offers prioritisation of
recommended foods using the foods' occurrence in nutritionally adequate food
combinations. Here, we systematically identify nutritionally recommendable
foods for semi- to strict vegetarian diets through the computation of
nutritional fitness. Along with commonly recommendable foods across different
diets, our analysis reveals favourable foods specific to each diet, such as
immature lima beans for a vegan diet as an amino acid and choline source, and
mushrooms for ovo-lacto vegetarian and vegan diets as a vitamin D source.
Furthermore, we find that selenium and other essential micronutrients can be
subject to deficiency in plant-based diets, and suggest nutritionally-desirable
dietary patterns. We extend our analysis to two hypothetical scenarios of
highly personalised, plant-based methionine-restricted diets. Our
nutrient-profiling approach may provide a useful guide for designing different
types of personalised vegetarian diets.

ground ray response to the shaded area, and may be, from other view, considered
as an indication to the height of the bodies or buildings, when it hidden due
to top view of the satellite image usually. The location of the object on the
earth affects its shadow length, direction and darkness. The ostensible sun
path in the sky also affects the shadow length and direction, it is depending
on the change of the rotation axis of planet about its center during the year.
And it is clear that the shadow is changing with the sun transmission in the
day times. The sun location needs complex equations, because there are several
angles describing its location with taking into consideration the location of
the shaded body on the earth spatially the latitude, and the shadow direction
and length depend on the sun location so it need more equations. Some
engineering purposes, and some engineers and designer can not process these
complex astronomy equations every time they need to calculate the shadow effect
on the urban region or garden for examples, or other architectural purposes, it
is unpractical process to estimate the shadow direction and length for civil
from these equation. So, we derived in this study a high accurate empirical
Gaussian equation to find shadow length percent in the limits of the study area
depends on single parameter which is the number of day during the year, and
calculating the percent of shadow, so we can calculate the shadow length
percent accurately in any day number by the suggested equation after knowing

order of magnitude. The ATLAS first level muon trigger rate is dominated by low
momentum muons, selected due to the moderate momentum resolution of the

by including the data of the precision muon drift tube (MDT) chambers in the
