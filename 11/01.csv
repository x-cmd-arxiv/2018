learning architectures in grading the severity of glaucoma based on color
fundus images. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively collected a dataset of
5978 fundus images and their glaucoma severities were annotated by the
consensus of two experienced ophthalmologists. We preprocessed the images to
generate global and local regions of interest (ROIs), namely the global
field-of-view images and the local disc region images. We then divided the
generated images into three independent sub-groups for training, validation,
and testing purposes. With the datasets, eight convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) (i.e., VGG16, VGG19, ResNet, DenseNet, InceptionV3, InceptionResNet,
Xception, and NASNetMobile) were trained separately to grade glaucoma severity,
and validated quantitatively using the area under the receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve and the quadratic kappa score. Results: The CNNs,
except VGG16 and VGG19, achieved average kappa scores of 80.36% and 78.22% when
trained from scratch on global and local ROIs, and 85.29% and 82.72% when
fine-tuned using the pre-trained weights, respectively. VGG16 and VGG19
achieved reasonable accuracy when trained from scratch, but they failed when
using pre-trained weights for global and local ROIs. Among these CNNs, the
DenseNet had the highest classification accuracy (i.e., 75.50%) based on
pre-trained weights when using global ROIs, as compared to 65.50% when using
local ROIs. Conclusion: The experiments demonstrated the feasibility of the
deep learning technology in grading glaucoma severity. In particular, global
field-of-view images contain relatively richer information that may be critical
for glaucoma assessment, suggesting that we should use the entire field-of-view
of a fundus image for training a deep learning network.

spectroscopy (ARPES), because the two experimental methods suggest a very
different number of terminations of the (100) surface with different

find that two of the well-ordered topographies reported in earlier STM studies
can be associated with the crystal terminations identified using photoemission.
We further observe a reversal of the STM contrast with bias voltage for one of
the topographies. We ascribe this result to a different energy dependence of Sm

their changes with a soft gel pad. The method assumes the object is mostly
rigid and treats the motion of object's imprint on sensor surface as a 2D
rigid-body motion. We use the deviation of the true motion field from that of a
2D planar rigid transformation as a measure of slip. The output is a dense slip
field which we use to detect when small areas of the contact patch start to
slip (incipient slip). The method can detect both translational and rotational
incipient slip without any prior knowledge of the object at 24 Hz. We test the
method on 10 objects 240 times and achieve 86.25% detection accuracy. We
further show how the slip feedback can be used to monitor the gripping force to
avoid slip with a closed-loop bottle-cap screwing and unscrewing experiment

applications involving {\em big data} and {\em big models}. Big data refers to
situations where the amounts of training data available and needed causes
difficulties in the training phase of the pipeline. Big model refers to
situations where large dimensional and over-parameterized models are needed for
the application at hand. Both of these phenomena lead to a dramatic increase in
research activity aimed at taming the issues via the design of new

{\em big constraints} scenario and argue that elaborate machine learning
systems of the future will necessarily need to account for a large number of
real-world constraints, which will need to be incorporated in the training
process. This line of work is largely unexplored, and provides ample
opportunities for future work and applications. To handle the {\em big
constraints} regime, we propose a {\em stochastic penalty} formulation which
{\em reduces the problem to the well understood big data regime}. Our
formulation has many interesting properties which relate it to the original
problem in various ways, with mathematical guarantees. We give a number of
results specialized to nonconvex loss functions, smooth convex functions,
strongly convex functions and convex constraints. We show through experiments
that our approach can beat competing approaches by several orders of magnitude

  plasticity problems",,,,,"physics.comp-ph cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Small-scale plasticity problems are often characterised by different
patterning behaviours ranging from macroscopic down to the atomistic scale. In
successful models of such complex behaviour, its origin lies within
non-convexity of the governing free energy functional. A common approach to
solve such non-convex problems numerically is by regularisation through a
viscous formulation. This, however, may require the system to be overdamped and
hence potentially has a strong impact on the obtained results. To avoid this
side-effect, this paper addresses the treatment of the full non-convexity by an
appropriate numerical solution algorithm -- the truncated Newton method. The
presented method is a double iterative approach which successively generates
quadratic approximations of the energy landscape and minimises these by an
inner iterative scheme, based on the conjugate gradient method. The inner
iterations are terminated when either a sufficient energy decrease is achieved
or, to incorporate the treatment of non-convexity, a direction of negative
curvature is encountered. If the latter never happens, the method reduces to
Newton--Raphson iterations, solved by the conjugate gradient method, with a
subsequent line search. However, in the case of a non-convex energy it avoids
convergence to a saddle point and adds robustness. The stability of the
truncated Newton method is demonstrated for the, highly non-convex,
Peierls-Nabarro model, solved within a Finite Element framework. A potential
drop in efficiency due to an occasional near singular Hessian is remedied by a
trust region like extension, which is physically based on the Peierls-Nabarro
disregistry profile. The result is an efficient numerical scheme with a high
stability that is independent of any regularisation.

machine learning models. Yet, its advantages over SGD have not been
theoretically clarified. Indeed, as we show in our paper, both theoretically
and empirically, Nesterov SGD with any parameter selection does not in general
provide acceleration over ordinary SGD. Furthermore, Nesterov SGD may diverge
for step sizes that ensure convergence of ordinary SGD. This is in contrast to
the classical results in the deterministic scenario, where the same step size
ensures accelerated convergence of the Nesterov's method over optimal gradient
descent.
  To address the non-acceleration issue, we introduce a compensation term to
Nesterov SGD. The resulting algorithm, which we call MaSS, converges for same
step sizes as SGD. We prove that MaSS obtains an accelerated convergence rates
over SGD for any mini-batch size in the linear setting. For full batch, the
convergence rate of MaSS matches the well-known accelerated rate of the
Nesterov's method.
  We also analyze the practically important question of the dependence of the
convergence rate and optimal hyper-parameters on the mini-batch size,
demonstrating three distinct regimes: linear scaling, diminishing returns and
saturation.
  Experimental evaluation of MaSS for several standard architectures of deep

existence of a unique SOPS for the corresponding scalar DDE implies existence
of a unique synchronous SOPS for the coupled DDEs. However, stability of the
SOPS for the scalar DDE does not generally imply stability of the synchronous
SOPS for the coupled DDEs. We obtain an explicit formula, depending only on the

values of the nonlinear negative feedback function near plus/minus infinity,
that determines the stability of the synchronous SOPS in the asymptotic regime
where the nonlinear term is heavily weighted. We also treat the special cases

nonnegative coupled systems, in the aforementioned asymptotic regime. Our
approach is to estimate the characteristic (Floquet) multipliers for the

for the possible extent of selection bias by specifying the size of the
parameters in the bounds. We also show that the bounds, which differ depending
on the target population, result in summary measures that can be used to
calculate the minimum magnitude of the parameters required to shift a risk
ratio to the null. The summary measure can be used to determine the overall
strength of selection that would be necessary to explain away a result. We then
show that the bounds and summary measures can be simplified in certain contexts
or with certain assumptions. Using examples with varying selection mechanisms,
we also demonstrate how researchers can implement these simple sensitivity
analyses.

charge is quantised but no theoretical explanation related to this law of
nature is offered. Such an explanation is postponed to graduate courses on
electrodynamics, quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, where the famous
Dirac quantisation condition is introduced, which states that a single magnetic
monopole in the Universe would explain the electric charge quantisation. Even
when this condition assumes the existence of a not-yet-detected magnetic
monopole, it provides the most accepted explanation for the observed
quantisation of the electric charge. However, the usual derivation of the Dirac
quantisation condition involves the subtle concept of an ""unobservable""
semi-infinite magnetised line, the so-called ""Dirac string,"" which may be
difficult to grasp in a first view of the subject. The purpose of this review
is to survey the concepts underlying the Dirac quantisation condition, in a way
that may be accessible to advanced undergraduate and graduate students. Some of
the discussed concepts are gauge invariance, singular potentials,
single-valuedness of the wave function, undetectability of the Dirac string and
quantisation of the electromagnetic angular momentum. Five quantum-mechanical
and three semi-classical derivations of the Dirac quantisation condition are
reviewed. In addition, a simple derivation of this condition involving
heuristic and formal arguments is presented.

limitation of the marker vocabulary to known entities. In this proof-of-concept
study, we propose unsupervised identification of anomalies as candidates for
markers in retinal Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging data without a

candidates occurring frequently in the data, and demonstrate that these markers
show predictive value in the task of detecting disease. A careful qualitative
analysis of the identified data driven markers reveals how their quantifiable
occurrence aligns with our current understanding of disease course, in early-

denoising autoencoder is trained on healthy images, and a one-class support
vector machine identifies anomalies in new data. Clustering in the anomalies
identifies stable categories. Using these markers to classify healthy-, early
AMD- and late AMD cases yields an accuracy of 81.40%. In a second binary
classification experiment on a publicly available data set (healthy vs.
intermediate AMD) the model achieves an area under the ROC curve of 0.944.

these coupling constants throughout the Brillouin zone for crystalline
materials remains limited. To address this need, we developed a Green's
function formalism to capture electron-phonon contributions to core-level
spectroscopies without explicitly solving the full vibronic problem. Our
approach is based on the cumulant expansion of the Green's function combined
with many-body theory calculated vibrational coupling constants. The
methodology is applied to X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, X-ray absorption
spectroscopy (XAS), and RIXS. In the case of the XAS and RIXS, we use a
2-particle exciton Green's function, which accounts implicitly for
particle-hole interference effects that have previously proved difficult. To
demonstrate the methodology and gain a deeper understanding of the experimental
technique, we apply our formalism to small molecules, for which unambiguous
experimental data exist. This comparison reveals that the vibronic coupling
constant probed by RIXS is in fact related to exciton-phonon coupling rather
than electron-phonon coupling, challenging the conventional interpretation of
the experiment.

leveraging a pronunciation dictionary, word boundary annotations, and
constraints on word durations. We find that constraining word durations leads
to the most improvement. Finally, we analyze the word embedding space learned

the pseudoscalar (A), the charged scalars($H^\pm$) and the neutral scalar H,

have mass lighter than the 125 GeV SM-like Higgs state $h$. Due to the presence
of a residual $Z_2$ symmetry after the Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB), the
neutral scalar $H$ emerges as the Dark Matter candidate in this scenario. As an
effect of this possibility, the SM-like scalar $h$ will have an extra invisible
decay mode of $h \rightarrow H H$ in this framework. We propose the model and

been unambiguously observed so far. They are, however, promising candidates for
the progenitors of the heaviest binary black hole (BBH) mergers detected. If
these BBHs are the product of binary evolution, then PPISNe could occur in very
close binaries. Motivated by this, we discuss the implications of a PPISN
happening with a close binary companion, and what impact these events have on
the formation of merging BBHs through binary evolution. For this, we have
computed a set of models of metal-poor ($Z_\odot/10$) single helium stars using
the \texttt{MESA} software instrument. For PPISN progenitors with pre-pulse
masses $>50M_\odot$ we find that, after a pulse, heat deposited throughout the
layers of the star that remain bound cause it to expand to more than
$100R_\odot$ for periods of $10^2-10^4\;$~yrs depending on the mass of the
progenitor. This results in long-lived phases of Roche-lobe overflow or even
common-envelope events if there is a close binary companion, leading to
additional electromagnetic transients associated to PPISN eruptions. If we
ignore the effect of these interactions, we find that mass loss from PPISNe
reduces the final black hole spin by $\sim 30\%$, induces eccentricities below
the threshold of detectability of the LISA observatory, and can produce a
double-peaked distribution of measured chirp masses in BBH mergers observed by
ground-based detectors.

samples to estimate the signal covariance matrix (coupled phase), ii) plug in
the resulting covariance estimate as the true covariance matrix into the
Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) estimator to reconstruct each signal sample
individually (decoupled phase). As a consequence of this decomposition, we are
able to provide further insights on the performance of $\ell_{2,1}$-LS for MMV.
In particular, we address how the signal correlations and dictionary mismatch
affects its performance. Moreover, we show that by using the decoupling
property one can obtain a variety of MMV algorithms with performances even
better than that of $\ell_{2,1}$-LS. We also provide numerical simulations to
validate our theoretical results.

frequencies, and they have been adopted for a range of uses from astronomical
observation to thermal imaging. As uses diversify, there is an increasing
demand for faster, more sensitive room-temperature bolometers. To this end,
graphene has generated interest because of its miniscule heat capacity and its
intrinsic ultra-broadband absorption, properties that would allow it to quickly
detect low levels of light of nearly any wavelength. Yet, graphene has
disappointed its expectations in traditional electrical bolometry at room
temperature, because of its weakly temperature-dependent resistivity and
exceptionally high thermal conductivity. Here, we overcome these challenges
with a new approach that detects light by tracking the resonance frequency of a
graphene nanomechanical resonator. The absorbed light heats up and thermally
tensions the resonator, thereby changing its frequency. Using this approach, we
achieve a room-temperature noise-equivalent power of 7 pW/Hz^1/2, a value 100
times more sensitive than electrical graphene bolometers, and speeds (1.3 MHz)
that greatly surpass state-of-the-art microbolometers.

resolution CMB experiment like CMB S4 and a galaxy survey like DESI or LSST,
one can measure the radial velocity field with very high signal to noise over a
large volume of the universe. In this paper we show how this measurement can be
used to improve constraints on primordial non-Gaussianities of the local type.
The velocity field provides a measurement of the unbiased matter perturbations
on large scales, which can be cross-correlated with the biased large-scale
galaxy density field. This results in sample variance cancellation for a
measurement of scale-dependent bias due to a non-zero $f_{NL}$. Using this
method we forecast that CMB S4 and LSST combined reach a sensitivity
$\sigma_{f_{NL}} \sim 0.5$, which is a factor of three improvement over the
sensitivity using LSST alone (without internal sample variance cancellation).
We take into account critical systematics like photometric redshifts, the kSZ
optical depth degeneracy, and systematics affecting the shape of the galaxy
auto-power spectrum and find that these have negligible impact, thus making kSZ
tomography a robust probe for primordial non-Gaussianities. We also forecast
the impact of mass binning on our constraints. The techniques proposed in this
paper could be an important component of achieving the theoretically important
threshold of $\sigma_{f_{NL}} \lesssim 1$ with future surveys.

signal analysis to measure feature influence. By analyzing synthetic graph
signals with a blue noise spectrum, we show that we can measure the importance

small random subsequences of the data at each MCMC iteration within stochastic

inaccurate inference and prediction/detection of rare events. We propose a
targeted sub-sampling (TASS) approach that over-samples observations
corresponding to rare latent states when calculating the stochastic gradient of
parameters associated with them. TASS uses an initial clustering of the data to
construct subsequence weights that reduce the variance in gradient estimation.
This leads to improved sampling efficiency, in particular in settings where the
rare latent states correspond to extreme observations. We demonstrate
substantial gains in predictive and inferential accuracy on real and synthetic

from the more familiar helical magnetorotational instability, operating at
positive shear above the Liu limit, in that it works instead for a wide range
of the positive shear when ${\rm (i)}$ a combination of axial/poloidal and
azimuthal/toroidal magnetic fields is applied and ${\rm (ii)}$ the magnetic
Prandtl number is not too close to unity. We study this instability first with
radially local WKB analysis and then confirm its existence using a global
stability analysis of the magnetized flow between two rotating cylinders with

also demonstrate the presence of the new instability in a magnetized viscous

arise in this case with a characteristic growth time comparable to the solar

six-dimensional (6D) phase space information to derive kinematical maps within
5 kpc of the Sun, which is a reachable range for stars with relative error in
distance lower than 20%.
  AIMS. Here we aim to extend the range of distances by a factor of two to
three, thus adding the range of Galactocentric distances between 13 kpc and 20
kpc to the previous maps, with their corresponding error and root mean square
values.
  METHODS. We make use of the whole sample of stars of Gaia-DR2 including
radial velocity measurements, which consists in more than seven million
sources, and we apply a statistical deconvolution of the parallax errors based
on the Lucy's inversion method of the Fredholm integral equations of the first
kind, without assuming any prior.
  RESULTS. The new extended maps provide lots of new and corroborated
information about the disk kinematics: significant departures of circularity in
the mean orbits with radial Galactocentric velocities between -20 and +20 km/s
and vertical velocities between -10 and +10 km/s; variations of the azimuthal
velocity with position; asymmetries between the northern and the southern
Galactic hemispheres, especially towards the anticenter that includes a larger
azimuthal velocity in the south; and others.
  CONCLUSIONS. These extended kinematical maps can be used to investigate the
different dynamical models of our Galaxy, and we will present our own analyses
in the forthcoming second part of this paper. At present, it is evident that
the Milky Way is far from a simple stationary configuration in rotational
equilibrium, but is characterized by streaming motions in all velocity
components with conspicuous velocity gradients.

distribution at the core of each cluster and magnifies the universe behind it.
MACS J0417.5-1154 at z=0.443 is one of the most massive clusters known based on
weak lensing, X-ray, and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich analyses. Here we compute a strong
lens model of MACS J0417 based on Hubble Space Telescope imaging observations
collected, in part, by the Reionization Lensing Cluster Survey (RELICS), and
recently reported spectroscopic redshifts from the MUSE instrument on the Very
Large Telescope (VLT). We measure an Einstein radius of ThetaE=36'' at z = 9
and a mass projected within 200 kpc of M(200 kpc) = 1.78+0.01-0.03x10**14Msol.
Using this model, we measure a ratio between the mass attributed to
cluster-member galaxy halos and the main cluster halo of order 1:100. We assess
the probability to detect magnified high-redshift galaxies in the field of this
cluster, both for comparison with RELICS HST results and as a prediction for
the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Guaranteed Time Observations upcoming for
this cluster. Our lensing analysis indicates that this cluster has similar
lensing strength to other clusters in the RELICS program. Our lensing analysis
predicts a detection of at least a few z~6-8 galaxies behind this cluster, at
odds with a recent analysis that yielded no such candidates in this field.
Reliable strong lensing models are crucial for accurately predicting the
intrinsic properties of lensed galaxies. As part of the RELICS program, our
strong lensing model produced with the Lenstool parametric method is publicly
available through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST).

does the effective factorization of interior and exterior degrees of freedom
emerge in gravity?, and (2) How does the underlying degeneracy of states wind
up having a geometric realization in the horizon area and in properties of the
singularity? We explore these puzzles in the context of an incipient black hole
in the AdS/CFT correspondence, the microstates of which are dual to half-BPS
states of the $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory. First, we construct a
code subspace for this black hole and show how to organize it as a tensor
product of a universal macroscopic piece (describing the exterior), and a
factor corresponding to the microscopic degrees of freedom (describing the
interior). We then study the classical phase space and symplectic form for
low-energy excitations around the black hole. On the AdS side, we find that the
symplectic form has a new physical degree of freedom at the stretched horizon
of the black hole, reminiscent of soft hair, which is absent in the
microstates. We explicitly show how such a soft mode emerges from the
microscopic phase space in the dual CFT via a canonical transformation and how
it encodes partial information about the microscopic degrees of freedom of the
black hole.

embedding of tokens that are relevant to the question and candidate answers,

proposed strategies on the largest general domain multiple-choice MRC dataset
RACE, we obtain a 5.8% absolute increase in accuracy over the previous best
result achieved by the same pre-trained model fine-tuned on RACE without the

previous state-of-the-art approaches on six representative non-extractive MRC

we simulate the full spectral function as an average over multiple domains with

modeling. Tracking drifters in large-scale geophysical flows can involve
uncertainty in drifter location, complex inertial effects, and other factors
which make comparing them to simulated Lagrangian trajectories from numerical
models extremely challenging. Temporal and spatial discretization, factors
necessary in modeling large scale flows, also contribute to separation between
real and simulated drifter trajectories. The chaotic advection inherent in
these turbulent flows tends to separate even closely spaced tracer particles,
making error metrics based solely on drifter displacements unsuitable for
estimating model parameters. We propose to instead use error in the coherent
structure coloring (CSC) field to assess model skill. The CSC field provides a
spatial representation of the underlying coherent patterns in the flow, and we
show that it is a more robust metric for assessing model accuracy. Through the
use of two test cases, one considering spatial uncertainty in particle
initialization, and one examining the influence of stochastic error along a
trajectory and temporal discretization, we show that error in the coherent
structure coloring field can be used to accurately determine single or multiple
simultaneously unknown model parameters, whereas a conventional error metric
based on error in drifter displacement fails. Because the CSC field enhances
the difference in error between correct and incorrect model parameters, error
minima in model parameter sweeps become more distinct. The effectiveness and
robustness of this method for single and multi-parameter estimation in
analytical flows suggests that Lagrangian data assimilation for real oceanic
and atmospheric models would benefit from a similar approach.

computational complexity in solving the Eikonal equation, and has been employed
in numerous scientific and engineering fields. However, it has barely benefited
from fast-advancing multi-core and many-core architectures, due to the
challenges presented by its apparent sequential nature. In this paper, we
present a straightforward block-based approach for a highly scalable
parallelization of the fast marching method on shard-memory computers. Central
to our new algorithm is a simplified restarted narrow band strategy, with which
the global bound for terminating the front marching is replaced by an
incremental one, increasing by a given stride in each restart. It greatly
reduces load imbalance among blocks through a synchronized exchanging step
after the marching step. Furthermore, simple activation mechanisms are
introduced to skip blocks not involved in either step. Thus the new algorithm
mainly consists of two loops, each for performing one step on a group of
blocks. Notably, it does not contain any data race conditions at all, ideal for
a direct loop level parallelization using multiple threads. A systematic
performance study is carried out for several point source problems with various
speed functions on four grids with up to $1024^3$ points using two different
computers. Substantial parallel speedups, e.g., up to 3--5 times the number of
cores on a 16-core/32-thread computer and up to two orders of magnitude on a
64-core/256-thread computer, are demonstrated with all cases. As an extra
bonus, our new algorithm also gives improved sequential performance in most
scenarios. Detailed pseudo-codes are provided to illustrate the modification
procedure from the single-block sequential algorithm to the multi-block one in
a step-by-step manner.

as the rapid cadence of these observations provides a novel opportunity to
probe BAL variability on shorter rest-frame timescales than have previously
been explored. In a sample of 27 quasars with a median of 58 spectral epochs
per quasar, we have identified 15 quasars ($55^{+18}_{-14}$%), 19 of 37 CIV BAL

exhibit significant CIV BAL equivalent-width variability on timescales of less
than 10 days in the quasar rest frame. These frequencies indicate that such
variability is common among quasars and BALs, though somewhat rare among epoch
pairs. Thus, models describing BALs and their behavior must account for
variability on timescales down to less than a day in the quasar rest frame. We
also examine a variety of spectral characteristics and find that in some cases,
BAL variability is best described by ionization-state changes, while other
cases are more consistent with changes in covering fraction or column density.

this paper, we explore failed detonation SNe Ia in the context of the
double-degenerate channel of merging white dwarfs. In particular, we have
carried out the first fully three-dimensional simulation of the merger of a ONe
WD with a CO WD. While the hot, tidally-disrupted carbon-rich disk material
originating from the CO WD secondary is readily susceptible to detonation in
such a merger, the ONe WD primary core is not. This merger yields a failed
detonation, resulting in the ejection of a small amount of mass, and leaving
behind a kicked, super-Chandrasekhar ONe WD remnant enriched by the fallback of
the products of nuclear burning. The resulting outburst is a rapidly-fading
optical transient with a small amount of radioactive $^{56}$Ni powering the
light curve. Consequently, the ONe-CO WD merger naturally produces a very faint

galaxies show great diversity in their morphology. Based on the conventional
""linear"" relationship between the colors and metallicities of GCs, the GC
metallicity distributions inferred from colors and in turn their formation
histories, should be as diverse as they appear. In contrast, here we show that
an alternative scenario rooted in the ""nonlinear"" nature of the
metallicity-to-color transformation points to a simpler and more coherent
picture. Our simulations of the color distributions for $\sim$80 GC systems in
early-type galaxies from the ACS Virgo and Fornax Cluster Surveys suggest that
the majority ($\sim$70$\%$) of early-type galaxies have old ($\sim$13 Gyr) and
coeval GCs. Their variety in the color distribution morphology stems mainly
from one parameter, the mean metallicity of a GC system. Furthermore, the color
distributions of the remaining ($\sim$30$\%$) GC systems are also explained by
the nonlinearity scenario, assuming additional young or intermediate-age GCs
with a number fraction of $\sim$20$\%$ of underlying old GCs. Our results
reinforce the nonlinearity explanation for the GC color bimodality and provide
a new perspective on early-type galaxy formation in the cluster environment,
such as the Virgo and Fornax galaxy clusters.

leading to a fractionalized semimetal phase with decoupled local moments and
conduction electrons. Upon increasing the Kondo lattice coupling, this phase is
unstable to the formation of broken symmetry states. Particularly important is
the opposing influence of the Kondo lattice coupling and long-range Coulomb
interaction. The former prefers to break the particle-hole symmetry while the
latter tends to restore it. The characteristic competition leads to possibly
multiple phase transitions, first from a fractionalized semimetal phase to a
fractionalized Fermi surface state with particle-hole pockets, followed by the
second transition to a fractionalized ferromagnetic state. Multiscale quantum
critical behaviors appear at nonzero temperatures and with external magnetic

ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. Observations indicate that in small populations,
the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is not fully populated; rather, stars
are sampled in a way that can be approximated as coming from an underlying
probability density function. To ensure the accuracy of cosmological
simulations in the ultra-faint regime, we present an improved treatment of the
IMF. We implement a self-consistent, stochastically populated IMF in
cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We test our method using high-resolution
simulations of a Milky Way halo, run to $z=6$, yielding a sample of nearly 100
galaxies. We also use an isolated dwarf galaxy to investigate the resulting
systematic differences in galaxy properties. We find that a stochastic IMF in
simulations makes feedback burstier, strengthening feedback, and quenching star
formation earlier in small dwarf galaxies. For galaxies in halos with mass
$\lesssim10^{8.5}$ M$_\odot$, a stochastic IMF typically leads to lower stellar
mass compared to a continuous IMF, sometimes by more than an order of
magnitude. We show that existing methods of ensuring discrete supernovae
incorrectly determine the mass of the star particle and its associated
feedback. This leads to overcooling of surrounding gas, with at least
${\sim}$10 per cent higher star formation and ${\sim}$30 per cent higher cold
gas content. Going forward, to accurately model dwarf galaxies and compare to

We test the

cloud objects ejected under the effect of post-main sequence mass loss and
stellar encounters. We do this by comparing the cumulative number density of
interstellar objects inferred from the detection of 1I/'Oumuamua to that
expected from these two clearing processes. We consider the 0.08--8 M$_{\odot}$
mass range, take into account the dependencies with stellar mass,
Galactocentric distance, and evolutionary state, and consider a wide range of
size distributions for the ejected objects. Our conclusion is that 1I/'Oumuamua
is likely not representative of this background population, even though there
are large uncertainties in the masses and size distributions of the exo-Oort
Clouds. We discuss whether the number density of free-floating, planetary-mass
objects derived from gravitational microlensing surveys could be used as a
discriminating measurement regarding 1I/'Oumuamua's origin (given their
potential common origin). We conclude that this is challenged by the mass
limitation of the surveys and the resulting uncertainty of the mass

the few observational constraints of the small end of this population, with the
caveat that, as we conclude here and in Moro-Mart\'{\i}n (2018), in the case of

representative of an isotropic background population, which makes the
derivation of a number density very challenging.

invariance, locality and unitarity, and depend on model details only through
coupling constants and particle content. In this paper, we develop an
understanding of inflationary correlators which parallels that of flat-space
scattering amplitudes. Specifically, we study slow-roll inflation with weak
couplings to extra massive particles, for which all correlators are controlled
by an approximate conformal symmetry on the boundary of the spacetime. After
classifying all possible contact terms in de Sitter space, we derive an
analytic expression for the four-point function of conformally coupled scalars
mediated by the tree-level exchange of massive scalars. Conformal symmetry
implies that the correlator satisfies a pair of differential equations with
respect to spatial momenta, encoding bulk time evolution in purely boundary
terms. The absence of unphysical singularities completely fixes this
correlator. A spin-raising operator relates it to the correlators associated
with the exchange of particles with spin, while weight-shifting operators map
it to the four-point function of massless scalars. We explain how these de
Sitter four-point functions can be perturbed to obtain inflationary three-point
functions. We reproduce many classic results in the literature and provide a
complete classification of all inflationary three- and four-point functions
arising from weakly broken conformal symmetry. The inflationary bispectrum
associated with the exchange of particles with arbitrary spin is completely
characterized by the soft limit of the simplest scalar-exchange four-point
function of conformally coupled scalars and a series of contact terms. Finally,
we demonstrate that the inflationary correlators contain flat-space scattering
amplitudes via a suitable analytic continuation of the external momenta.

secular evolution of stellar bars in the embedded galactic disks, using
high-resolution numerical simulations. For a sequence of halos with the
cosmological spin parameter lambda=0-0.09, and a representative angular
momentum distribution, we analyze evolution of induced DM bars amplitude and
quantify parameters of the response as well as trapping of DM orbits and
angular momentum transfer by the main and secondary resonances. We find that
(1) maximal amplitude of DM bars depends strongly on `lambda', while that of
the stellar bars is indifferent to `lambda'; (2) Efficiency of resonance
trapping of DM orbits by the bar increases with `lambda', and so is the mass
and the volume of DM bars; (3) Contribution of resonance transfer of angular
momentum to the DM halo increases with `lambda', and for larger spin, the DM
halo `talks' to itself, by moving the angular momentum to larger radii --- this
process is maintained by resonances; (4) Prograde and retrograde DM orbits play
different roles in angular momentum transfer. The `active' part of the halo
extends well beyond the bar region, up to few times the bar length in
equatorial plane and away from this plane. (5) We model evolution of diskless
DM halos and halos with frozen disks, and found them to be perfectly stable to
any Fourier modes. Finally, further studies adopting a range of mass and
specific angular momentum distributions of the DM halo will generalize the
dependence of DM response on the halo spin and important implications for
direct detection of DM and that of the associated stellar tracers, such as
streamers.

the periodic electric and strain fields of the SAW can be used to modify the

can generate acousto-electric currents in graphene. These increase linearly

gravitational evolution. To tackle this, we generate initial conditions in
which the density perturbation amplitudes are {\it fixed} to the ensemble
average power spectrum -- and are generated in {\it pairs} with exactly
opposite phases. We run $50$ such simulations ($25$ pairs) and compare their

we find estimates of the 1D and 3D power spectra converge $34$ and $12$ times
faster in a paired-fixed ensemble compared with a standard ensemble. We
conclude that, by reducing the computational time required to achieve fixed

excitation gaps against density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) results and
find excellent agreement of the resulting phase boundaries. We also compare the
fully quantum treatment of phonons against the standard Born-Oppenheimer (BO)

in the adiabatic regime, but fails entirely in the anti-adiabatic regime, where
BO predicts a sharp direct transition from Mott to Peierls insulator, whereas

lexicalization stage to use much fewer words, or to report more facts in the
same space. Decisions made during content selection and lexicalization may also
lead to more or fewer sentence aggregation opportunities, affecting the length
and readability of the resulting texts. Building upon on a publicly available
state of the art natural language generator for Semantic Web ontologies, this
article presents an Integer Linear Programming model that, unlike pipeline
architectures, jointly considers choices available in content selection,
lexicalization, and sentence aggregation to avoid greedy local decisions and
produce more compact texts, i.e., texts that report more facts per word.
Compact texts are desirable, for example, when generating advertisements to be
included in Web search results, or when summarizing structured information in
limited space. An extended version of the proposed model also considers a
limited form of referring expression generation and avoids redundant sentences.
An approximation of the two models can be used when longer texts need to be
generated. Experiments with three ontologies confirm that the proposed models
lead to more compact texts, compared to pipeline systems, with no deterioration
or with improvements in the perceived quality of the generated texts.

development of next generation sequencing technology (NGS) and slow and
expensive experimental extraction of useful information like annotation of
protein sequence in different functional aspects, is ever widening, which can
be reduced by employing automatic function prediction (AFP) approaches. Gene
Ontology (GO), comprising of more than 40, 000 classes, defines three aspects
of protein function names Biological Process (BP), Cellular Component (CC),
Molecular Function (MF). Multiple functions of a single protein, has made
automatic function prediction a large-scale, multi-class, multi-label task. In
this paper, we present DEEPGONET, a novel cascaded convolutional and recurrent
neural network, to predict the top-level hierarchy of GO ontology. The network
takes the primary sequence of protein as input which makes it more useful than
other prevailing state-of-the-art deep learning based methods with multi-modal
input, making them less applicable for proteins where only primary sequence is
available. All predictions of different protein functions of our network are
performed by the same architecture, a proof of better generalization as
demonstrated by promising performance on a variety of organisms while trained
on Homo sapiens only, which is made possible by efficient exploration of vast
output space by leveraging hierarchical relationship among GO classes. The
promising performance of our model makes it a potential avenue for directing
experimental protein functions exploration efficiently by vastly eliminating
possible routes which is done by the exploring only the suggested routes from
our model. Our proposed model is also very simple and efficient in terms of
computational time and space compared to other architectures in literature.

user-specific data may greatly enhance user experiences, reduce development
costs, and protect user's privacy. In this work, we propose to incorporate a
novel Mixture of Experts (MOE) approach to accomplish this goal. This
architecture comprises of a Global Expert (GE), a Local Expert (LE) and a
Gating Network (GN). The GE is a trained DNN developed on a large training
dataset representative of many potential users. After deployment on an embedded
edge device, GE will be subject to customized, user-specific data (e.g., accent
in speech) and its performance may suffer. This problem may be alleviated by
training a local DNN (the local expert, LE) on a small size customized training
data to correct the errors made by GE. A gating network then will be trained to
determine whether an incoming data should be handled by GE or LE. Since the
customized dataset is in general very small, the cost of training LE and GN
would be much lower than that of re-training of GE. The training of LE and GN
thus can be performed at local device, properly protecting the privacy of
customized training data. In this work, we developed a prototype MOE
architecture for handwritten alphanumeric character recognition task. We use
EMNIST as the generic dataset, LeNet5 as GE, and handwritings of 10 users as
the customized dataset. We show that with the LE and GN, the classification
accuracy is significantly enhanced over the customized dataset with almost no
degradation of accuracy over the generic dataset. In terms of energy and
network size, the overhead of LE and GN is around 2.5% compared to those of GE.

Residual Distribution (SGH RD) scheme for Lagrangian hydrodynamics. The SGH RD
scheme is based on the staggered finite element discretizations as in [Dobrev
et al., SISC, 2012]. However, the advantage of the residual formulation over
classical FEM approaches consists in the natural mass matrix diagonalization
which allows one to avoid the solution of the linear system with the global
sparse mass matrix while retaining the desired order of accuracy. This is
achieved by using Bernstein polynomials as finite element shape functions and
coupling the space discretization with the deferred correction type
timestepping method. Moreover, it can be shown that for the Lagrangian
formulation written in non-conservative form, our residual distribution scheme
ensures the exact conservation of the mass, momentum and total energy. In this
paper we also discuss construction of numerical viscosity approximations for
the SGH RD scheme allowing to reduce the dissipation of the numerical solution.
Thanks to the generic formulation of the staggered grid residual distribution
scheme, it can be directly applied to both single- and multimaterial and
multiphase models. Finally, we demonstrate computational results obtained with
the proposed residual distribution scheme for several challenging test
problems.

Based on stellar evolution and merger simulations we argue that the red

at a constant rate of $\sim 2.8$ blue stragglers per Gyr over the last $\sim

collapse of the cluster at an age of about 9.8 Gyr, whereas the constantly
formed population is the result of mass transfer and mergers through binary
evolution. In that case about half the binaries in the cluster effectively
result in a blue straggler.

(i) in the machine learning field methods such as (hidden) Markov models and
recurrent neural networks have been developed and successfully applied to a
wide-range of tasks, (ii) in process mining process discovery techniques aim to
generate human-interpretable descriptive models, and (iii) in the grammar

goal - learning a model that accurately describes the behavior in the
underlying data. Those sequence models are generative, i.e, they can predict
what elements are likely to occur after a given unfinished sequence. So far,
these fields have developed mainly in isolation from each other and no

dramatically expand the landscape of available optical responses, which may
bring new means of controlling light in photonic devices. In this work we
design such hybrid solid-state photonic metasurface integrating 2D TMD and
photonic all-dielectric metasurface. While TMD is naturally endowed with the
property of valley to optical-polarization coupling, the photonic metasurface
is designed to produce chiral field which selectively couples to the valley
degree of freedom of solid-state TMD component. We experimentally demonstrate
that such coupling leads to controlled valley polarization due to the coupling
of 2D materials with the chiral photonic metasurface. The measured emission
from valley excitons in this hybrid system yields the preferential emission of
specific helicity.

separating task-relevant representations from other confounding factors in the

Second, not all of these factors are readily observable. In this paper, we
present a deep conditional generative model that learns to disentangle a
task-relevant representation from an unknown number of confounding factors that
may grow infinitely. This is achieved by marrying the representational power of
deep generative models with Bayesian non-parametric factor models, where a
supervised deterministic encoder learns task-related representation and a
probabilistic encoder with an Indian Buffet Process (IBP) learns the unknown
number of unobservable confounding factors. We tested the presented model in
two datasets: a handwritten digit dataset (MNIST) augmented with colored digits

augmented with signal artifacts. These diverse data sets highlighted the
ability of the presented model to grow with the complexity of the data and

different from that for void percolation in jammed sphere packings. We propose
that the connected void regions of proteins are a defining feature of proteins

monitoring a patient's heart activity through processing Electrocardiogram
(ECG) signals is a key example, sue to high mortality rate of heart-related
disease. However, current heart monitoring devices suffer from two important
drawbacks: i) failure in capturing inter-patient variability, and ii)
incapability of identifying heart abnormalities ahead of time to take effective
preventive and therapeutic interventions.
  This paper proposed a novel predictive signal processing method to solve
these issues. We propose a two-step classification framework for ECG signals,
where a global classifier recognizes severe abnormalities by comparing the
signal against a universal reference model. The seemingly normal signals are
then passed through a personalized classifier, to recognize mild but
informative signal morphology distortions. The key idea is to develop a novel
deviation analysis based on a controlled nonlinear transformation to capture
significant deviations of the signal towards any of predefined abnormality
classes. Here, we embrace the proven but overlooked fact that certain features
of ECG signals reflect underlying cardiac abnormalities before the occurrences
of cardiac disease. The proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of
96.6% and provides a unique feature of predictive analysis by providing
warnings before critical heart conditions. In particular, the chance of
observing a severe problem (a red alarm) is raised by about 5% to 10% after
observing a yellow alarm of the same type. Although we used this methodology to
provide early precaution messages to elderly and high-risk heart-patients, the
proposed method is general and applicable to similar bio-medical signal
processing applications.

resonant impurities, such as vacancies or 585 defects, lead to stretching of

type of spectrum has been observed in epitaxial graphene by photoemission
spectroscopy and discussed extensively in the literature. Second, nonresonant

stretch the spectrum but provide a line broadening that increases with energy.
Finally, disorder that breaks sublattice symmetry, such as vacancies placed in

struts and rods (trabeculae) that erode with age and the onset of bone diseases
like osteoporosis, leading to increased fracture risk. The traditional
diagnostic marker of osteoporosis, bone mineral density (BMD), has been shown
in ex vivo experiments to correlate poorly with fracture resistance when
considered on its own, while structural features in conjunction with BMD can
explain more of the variation in trabecular bone strength. We develop a
network-based model of trabecular bone by creating graphs from micro-computed
tomography images of human bone, with weighted links representing trabeculae
and nodes representing branch points. These graphs enable calculation of
quantitative network metrics to characterize trabecular structure. We also
create finite element models of the networks in which each link is represented
by a beam, facilitating analysis of the mechanical response of the bone samples
to simulated loading. We examine the structural and mechanical properties of
trabecular bone at the scale of individual trabeculae (of order 0.1 mm) and at
the scale of selected volumes of interest (approximately a few mm), referred to
as VOIs. At the VOI scale, we find significant correlations between the
stiffness of VOIs and 10 different structural metrics. Individually, the volume
fraction of each VOI is most strongly correlated to the stiffness of the VOI.
We use multiple linear regression to identify the smallest subset of variables
needed to capture the variation in stiffness. In a linear fit, we find that
node degree, weighted node degree, Z-orientation, weighted Z-orientation,
trabecular spacing, link length, and the number of links are the structural
metrics that are most significant (p < 0.05) in capturing the variation of
stiffness in trabecular networks.

  in a Dataset",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Typically clustering algorithms provide clustering solutions with
prespecified number of clusters. The lack of a priori knowledge on the true
number of underlying clusters in the dataset makes it important to have a
metric to compare the clustering solutions with different number of clusters.
This article quantifies a notion of persistence of clustering solutions that
enables comparing solutions with different number of clusters. The persistence
relates to the range of data-resolution scales over which a clustering solution
persists; it is quantified in terms of the maximum over two-norms of all the
associated cluster-covariance matrices. Thus we associate a persistence value
for each element in a set of clustering solutions with different number of
clusters. We show that the datasets where natural clusters are a priori known,
the clustering solutions that identify the natural clusters are most persistent
- in this way, this notion can be used to identify solutions with true number
of clusters. Detailed experiments on a variety of standard and synthetic
datasets demonstrate that the proposed persistence-based indicator outperforms
the existing approaches, such as, gap-statistic method, $X$-means, $G$-means,
$PG$-means, dip-means algorithms and information-theoretic method, in
accurately identifying the clustering solutions with true number of clusters.
Interestingly, our method can be explained in terms of the phase-transition
phenomenon in the deterministic annealing algorithm, where the number of
distinct cluster centers changes (bifurcates) with respect to an annealing
parameter.

examine propagation effects that could cause this suppression, and find that a
low-frequency spectral cutoff may be generic regardless of the specific FRB
emission mechanism. We then illustrate the effects of a low-frequency spectral
cutoff on the statistics of FRBs, given a cosmological source population. The
observed FRB rate peaks at a specific frequency under a variety of assumptions.
Observations at lower frequencies are more sensitive to high-redshift events
than observations above the maximal-rate frequency, and therefore result in
more sharply broken fluence distributions. Our results suggest that the absence
of low-frequency FRBs, and the differences between the Parkes and the
Australian Square Kilometre Array (ASKAP) FRB samples, can be fully explained

algorithms of the considered class are shown to be computationally simpler than

which is an important feature in scenarios with computationally limited nodes

Here, known spam sources/blacklisted IPs exploit the fact that their received
emails will be treated as (ground truth) labeled spam examples, and used for
classifier training (or re-training). The attacking source thus generates
emails that will skew the spam model, potentially resulting in great
degradation in classifier accuracy. Such attacks are successful mainly because
of the poor representation power of the naive Bayes (NB) model, with only a
single (component) density to represent spam (plus a possible attack). We
propose a defense based on the use of a mixture of NB models. We demonstrate
that the learned mixture almost completely isolates the attack in a second NB
component, with the original spam component essentially unchanged by the
attack. Our approach addresses both the scenario where the classifier is being
re-trained in light of new data and, significantly, the more challenging
scenario where the attack is embedded in the original spam training set. Even
for weak attack strengths, BIC-based model order selection chooses a
two-component solution, which invokes the mixture-based defense. Promising
results are presented on the TREC 2005 spam corpus.

popularity as a way to compress and explore chemical space efficiently. One of
the most important aspects of machine learning techniques is representation
through the feature vector, which should contain the most important descriptors
necessary to make accurate predictions, not least of which is the atomic
species in the molecule or material. In this work we introduce a compressed
representation of physical properties for atomic species we call the elemental
modes. The elemental modes provide an excellent representation by capturing
many of the nuances of the periodic table and the similarity of atomic species.
We apply the elemental modes to several different tasks for machine learning
algorithms and show that they enable us to make improvements to these tasks
even beyond simply achieving higher accuracy predictions.

achieve the channel capacity at infinite code length. They were selected for
use in the fifth generation of cellular mobile communications (5G). In
practical scenarios such as 5G, a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is concatenated
with polar codes to improve their finite length performance. This is mostly
beneficial for sequential successive-cancellation list decoders. However, for
parallel iterative belief propagation (BP) decoders, CRC is only used as an
early stopping criterion with incremental error-correction performance
improvement. In this paper, we first propose a CRC-polar BP (CPBP) decoder by
exchanging the extrinsic information between the factor graph of the polar code
and that of the CRC. We then propose a neural CPBP (NCPBP) algorithm which
improves the CPBP decoder by introducing trainable normalizing weights on the
concatenated factor graph. Our results on a 5G polar code of length 128 show
that at the frame error rate of 10^(-5) and with a maximum of 30 iterations,
the error-correction performance of CPBP and NCPBP are approximately 0.25 dB
and 0.5 dB better than that of the conventional CRC-aided BP decoder,
respectively, while introducing almost no latency overhead.

motion interference between neighboring molecules is not negligible, and this
interference can affect the reaction dynamics through machine operation. To
simulate such a situation, we propose a reaction-diffusion model consisting of

introduced through excluded volume repulsion. In the simulations, we observed
segregation and flow-like patterns enhanced by crowding out of relevant

amplitude and frequency of intrinsic perturbations to the AGN flux. We begin
this tutorial by reviewing discrete auto-regressive (AR) and moving-average

crux of many recommendation engines. However, existing recommendation engines
force raters with heterogeneous behavior profiles to map their intrinsic rating
scales to a common rating scale (e.g. 1-5). This non-linear transformation of
the rating scale shatters the low-rank structure of the rating matrix,
therefore resulting in a poor fit and consequentially, poor recommendations. In
this paper, we propose Clustered Monotone Transforms for Rating Factorization
(CMTRF), a novel approach to perform regression up to unknown monotonic
transforms over unknown population segments. Essentially, for recommendation
systems, the technique searches for monotonic transformations of the rating
scales resulting in a better fit. This is combined with an underlying matrix
factorization regression model that couples the user-wise ratings to exploit
shared low dimensional structure. The rating scale transformations can be
generated for each user, for a cluster of users, or for all the users at once,
forming the basis of three simple and efficient algorithms proposed in this
paper, all of which alternate between transformation of the rating scales and
matrix factorization regression. Despite the non-convexity, CMTRF is
theoretically shown to recover a unique solution under mild conditions.
Experimental results on two synthetic and seven real-world datasets show that
CMTRF outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines.

is solved with tabular CFR, and its solution is mapped back to the full game.
This process can be problematic because aspects of abstraction are often manual

a good abstraction requires knowledge of the equilibrium of the game. This
paper introduces Deep Counterfactual Regret Minimization, a form of CFR that

all phases of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, a kiloton-scale heavy water

signal types in the detector: six seasonal variations in the solar electron
neutrino survival probability differing in energy and time dependence, and two
shape changes to the oscillated solar neutrino energy spectrum. No evidence for
such signals is observed, and limits on the size of such effects are
established in the framework of the Standard Model Extension, including 40
limits on perviously unconstrained operators and improved limits on 15
additional operators. This makes limits on all minimal, Dirac-type Lorentz

sequences of jobs operated by ground staff agents, and have been widely studied
given its impact on operating costs. As these jobs are closely related to
flights arrivals and departures, flights delays disrupt ground staff schedules,
which leads to high additional costs. Our goal is to provide a solution for
shift planning at Air France that takes into account these additional costs. We
therefore introduce a stochastic version of the shift planning problem that
takes into accounts the cost of disruptions due to delay, and a column
generation approach to solve it. The key element of our column generation is
the algorithm for the pricing subproblem, which we model as a stochastic
resource constrained shortest path problem. Numerical results on Air France
industrial instances prove the relevance of the shift planning problem and the
efficiency of the solution method. The column generation can solve to
optimality instances with up to two hundred and fifty jobs. Moving from the

reduce the total operating costs by 3% to 5% on our instances.

double-ionization (TPDI) process of helium in a high-frequency laser field with
its frequency ranging from 1.6~a.u. to 3.0~a.u. and the pulse duration ranging
from 75 to 160~attoseconds. We found that there exists a characteristic time
$t_{c}$ for a TPDI process, such that the pattern of energy distribution of two
ionized electrons presents a peak or two, depending respectively on whether the
pulse duration is shorter or longer than $t_{c}$. Especially, as the pulse
duration is larger than $t_c$, the TPDI spectrum shows a double-peak structure
which is attributed to the fact that most of the electron-electron Coulomb
interaction energy is acquired by single electron during their oscillation
around the nucleus before the two electrons leave. Additionally, if the photon
energy is less than the ionization energy of He$^{+}$, $t_{c}$ is not a fixed
value, and it increases as the photon energy decreases; while if the energy of
a photon is greater than the ionization energy of He$^{+}$, $t_{c}$ is fixed at
about 105 attoseconds. We further found that, for a helium-like ion in its
ground state, the characteristic time for the case of the photon energy larger
than the ionization energy of the second electron has a key relation with the
Coulomb interaction energy $\overline{V}_{12}$ between the two electrons, which
can be expressed as $t_{c}\overline{V}_{12}=4.192$, a type of quantum
mechanical uncertainty relation between time and energy. In addition, this
relation can be attributed to the existence of a minimal evolution time from
the ground state to a double ionization state with two electrons carrying
different energies. These results may shed light on deeper understanding of
many-electron quantum dynamical processes.

constrained by partial differential equations (PDEs) with uncertain
coefficients. The method leverages two sources of inexactness that trade
accuracy for speed: (1) stochastic collocation based on dimension-adaptive
sparse grids (SGs), which approximates the stochastic objective function with a
limited number of quadrature nodes, and (2) projection-based reduced-order
models (ROMs), which generate efficient approximations to PDE solutions. These
two sources of inexactness lead to inexact objective function and gradient
evaluations, which are managed by a trust-region method that guarantees global
convergence by adaptively refining the sparse grid and reduced-order model
until a proposed error indicator drops below a tolerance specified by
trust-region convergence theory. A key feature of the proposed method is that
the error indicator---which accounts for errors incurred by both the sparse
grid and reduced-order model---must be only an asymptotic error bound, i.e., a
bound that holds up to an arbitrary constant that need not be computed. This
enables the method to be applicable to a wide range of problems, including
those where sharp, computable error bounds are not available; this
distinguishes the proposed method from previous works. Numerical experiments
performed on a model problem from optimal flow control under uncertainty verify
global convergence of the method and demonstrate the method's ability to
outperform previously proposed alternatives.

switch of unequal initial preparations on two ground states. This operation
uses single optical pulse sequence accomplishing both bright-STIRAP and

frustrated compound, CoAl2O4, and its gallium-substituted system, CoAl2-xGaxO4,
were investigated. Magnetically frustrated Co2+ with spin S = 3/2 on the
tetrahedral site formed a diamond lattice in CoAl2O4 located in the vicinity of
the magnetic phase boundary between Neel and spin-spiral states. In the
Ga-substituted system, the number of Co ions, the so-called inversion h
dominating the octahedral site, increased with increasing x. From comprehensive
crystallographic, magnetic, and thermal measurements, increments of both volume
and inversion strongly reduced the Neel point, while the latter also induced a
spin-glass state above the critical value of hc = 0.09. In the spin glass
state, h > hc, the orbital degree of freedom of Co2+ ions in the octahedral
site appeared in the magnetic entropy, which couples strongly with that of
spin, even above the magnetic transitions. Above h ~ hc, the field-induced
quenched magnetic moment appeared above the transitions. Therefore, a short
range ordered state emerged among the paramagnetic, antiferromganetic, and
spin-glass states in the magnetic phase diagram.

mixing framework that has been recently proposed as a possible structure for
the two nonets, namely $a_0 (980)$, $K_0^* (800)$, $f_0 (500)$, $f_0 (980)$ in
the light nonet, $a_0 (1450)$, $K_0^* (1430)$, $f_0 (1370)$, $f_0 (1500)$ in
the heavy nonet. First, we advocate that the two nonets form the flavor nonet
approximately satisfying the Gell-Mann--Okubo mass relation. Then we reexamine
the mass ordering generated from the tetraquark nonets and show that this mass
ordering is satisfied by the two nonets although the ordering in the heavy
nonet is marginal. The marginal mass ordering however can be regarded as
another signature for tetraquarks because it can be explained partially by the
hyperfine masses calculated from the tetraquark mixing framework. The
tetraquark mixing parameters are found to be independent of isospins giving
additional support for the formation of the flavor nonets. In addition, we
discuss the other approaches like two-quark pictures or meson-meson bound
states, and their possible limitations in explaining the two nonets. As a
peculiar signature distinguished from other approaches, we investigate the
fall-apart coupling strengths into two vector mesons from our tetraquarks.
Coupling strengths into the two-vector modes are found to enhance strongly in
the heavy nonet while they are suppressed in the light nonet. The coupling
ratios, which depend on the isospin channel, are found to be huge around $\sim
15$. This trend in the two-vector modes, which is opposite to that in the
two-pseudoscalar fall-apart modes, can provide another testing ground for the
tetraquark mixing framework. Some experimental evidences related to the
phenomena are discussed particularly from the resonances belonging to the heavy
nonet.

the same reasons, they often characterize the rate-limiting step in
simulations. To the extent that first-passage probabilities can be computed
without requiring direct simulation, the process of traversing entropic
barriers can replaced by a single choice from the computed (""first-passage"")
distribution. We will show that in the presence of certain entropic barriers,
first-passage probabilities are approximately invariant to the initial
configuration, provided that it is modestly far away from each of the targets.
We will further show that as a consequence of this invariance, the
first-passage distribution can be well-approximated in terms of ""capacities"" of
local sets around the targets. Using these theoretical results and a Monte
Carlo mechanism for approximating capacities, we provide a method for
estimating the hitting probabilities of small targets in the presence of
entropic barriers. In numerical experiments with an idealized (""golf-course"")
potential, the estimates are as accurate as the results of direct simulations,
but far faster to compute.

based on the similarity between drugs. Recently, researchers revealed that
predictive performance can be improved by better modeling the interactions
between drug pairs with bilinear forms. However, the shallow models leveraging
bilinear forms suffer from limitations on capturing complicated nonlinear

learns a representation of interactions between drug pairs and has the
capability of characterizing complicated nonlinear interactions more precisely.
Moreover, a novel loss called CuXCov is designed to effectively learn the

chemical structures of drug pairs for specific DDIs, assisting pharmacists to
better understand the relationship between drug chemistry and DDI. Experimental
results on real-world datasets demonstrate that MuLFA consistently outperforms

soliton state and investigate the relation to the yrast states. By interpreting
a quantum dark soliton as a Bose-Einstein condensation to the wave function of
a classical dark soliton, we find that the quantum soliton state has a large
weight only on the yrast states, which is analytically proved in the free-boson

results, we derive a parameter-free expression of a quantum soliton state that
is written as a superposition of yrast states with Gaussian weights. The
density profile of this quantum soliton state excellently agrees to that of the

Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), which are widely used to model dynamic
optimization in many applications. Most prior works consider the case where the
uncertainty on transitions related to different states is uncoupled and the
adversary is allowed to select the worst possible realization for each state
unrelated to others, potentially leading to highly conservative solutions. On
the other hand, the case of general uncertainty sets is known to be
intractable. We consider a factor model for probability transitions where the
transition probability is a linear function of a factor matrix that is
uncertain and belongs to a factor matrix uncertainty set. This is a fairly
general model of uncertainty in probability transitions, allowing the decision
maker to model dependence between probability transitions across different
states and it is significantly less conservative than prior approaches. We show
that under an underlying rectangularity assumption, we can efficiently compute
an optimal robust policy under the factor matrix uncertainty model.
Furthermore, we show that there is an optimal robust policy that is
deterministic, which is of interest from an interpretability standpoint. We
also introduce the robust counterpart of important structural results of
classical MDPs, including the maximum principle and Blackwell optimality, and
we provide a computational study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in mitigating the conservativeness of robust policies.

as local accuracy estimates and ranking. However, using only one criterion may
lead to a poor estimation of the classifier's competence. In order to deal with
this issue, we have proposed a novel dynamic ensemble selection framework using
meta-learning, called META-DES. An important aspect of the META-DES framework
is that multiple criteria can be embedded in the system encoded as different
sets of meta-features. However, some DES criteria are not suitable for every
classification problem. For instance, local accuracy estimates may produce poor
results when there is a high degree of overlap between the classes. Moreover, a
higher classification accuracy can be obtained if the performance of the
meta-classifier is optimized for the corresponding data. In this paper, we
propose a novel version of the META-DES framework based on the formal
definition of the Oracle, called META-DES.Oracle. The Oracle is an abstract
method that represents an ideal classifier selection scheme. A meta-feature
selection scheme using an overfitting cautious Binary Particle Swarm
Optimization (BPSO) is proposed for improving the performance of the
meta-classifier. The difference between the outputs obtained by the
meta-classifier and those presented by the Oracle is minimized. Thus, the
meta-classifier is expected to obtain results that are similar to the Oracle.
Experiments carried out using 30 classification problems demonstrate that the
optimization procedure based on the Oracle definition leads to a significant
improvement in classification accuracy when compared to previous versions of

interstitials (Oins) are present in 2D WSe2, because of facile O2 dissociation
at Se vacancies, or due to the presence of WO3 precursors in CVD growth. These
defects give STM images in good agreement with experiment. The optical
properties of point defects in 2D WSe2 are important because single photon
emission (SPE) from 2D WSe2 has been observed experimentally. While strain
gradients funnel the exciton in real space, point defects are necessary for the
localization of the exciton at length scales that enable photons to be emitted
one at a time. Using state-of-the-art GW-Bethe-Salpeter-equation calculations,
we predict that only Oins defects give localized excitons within the energy
range of SPE in previous experiments, making them a likely source of previously
observed SPE. No other point defects (O_Se, Se vacancies, W vacancies and Se_W

coordination architecture that allows for separate ownership of data, operates
with data subjected to a large buffering delay, and employs a new measure of
power quality. The two-layer architecture comprises a centralized model
predictive controller (MPC) and several decentralized MPCs each operating
independently with no direct communication between them and with infrequent
communication with the centralized controller. The goal is to minimize a
combination of total energy cost and a measure of power quality while obeying
cyber-physical constraints. The global controller utilizes a fast AC optimal
power flow (OPF) solver and extensive parallelization to scale the solution to
large networks. Each local controller attempts to maximize arbitrage profit
while following the load profile and constraints dictated by the global
controller. Extensive simulations are performed for two distribution networks
under a wide variety of possible storage and solar penetrations enabled by the
controller speed. The simulations show that (i) the two-layer architecture can
achieve tenfold improvement in power quality relative to no coordination, while
capturing nearly all of the available arbitrage profit for a moderate amount of
storage penetration, and (ii) both power quality and arbitrage profits are
optimized when the solar and storage are distributed more widely over the
network, hence it is more effective to install storage closer to the consumer.

optimization problem. We focus on fairness constraints like Disparate Impact,
Demographic Parity, and Equalized Odds, which are non-decomposable and
non-convex. Researchers define convex surrogates of the constraints and then
apply convex optimization frameworks to obtain fair classifiers. Surrogates
serve only as an upper bound to the actual constraints, and convexifying
fairness constraints might be challenging.
  We propose a neural network-based framework, \emph{FNNC}, to achieve fairness
while maintaining high accuracy in classification. The above fairness
constraints are included in the loss using Lagrangian multipliers. We prove
bounds on generalization errors for the constrained losses which asymptotically
go to zero. The network is optimized using two-step mini-batch stochastic
gradient descent. Our experiments show that FNNC performs as good as the state
of the art, if not better. The experimental evidence supplements our

fairness in classification, which is easily extendable to many fairness

representation of the scene into another. Various approaches have been proposed
and achieved highly desirable results. Nevertheless, its accomplishment
requires abundant paired training data which are expensive to acquire.
Therefore, models for translation are usually trained on a set of paired
training data which are carefully and laboriously designed. Our work is focused
on learning through automatically generated paired data. We propose a method to
generate fake sketches from images using an adversarial network and then pair
the images with corresponding fake sketches to form large-scale multi-class
paired training data for training a sketch-to-image translation model. Our
model is an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder generates fake
sketches from images and the decoder performs sketch-to-image translation.
Qualitative results show that the encoder can be used for generating
large-scale multi-class paired data under low supervision. Our current dataset
now contains 61255 image and (fake) sketch pairs from 256 different categories.
These figures can be greatly increased in the future thanks to our weak

field of computer vision due to the development of commodity depth cameras, by
which the human activity is represented as a sequence of 3D skeleton postures.
Assuming human body 3D joint locations of an activity lie on a manifold, the
problem of recognizing human activity is formulated as the computation of
activity manifold-manifold distance (AMMD). In this paper, we first design an
efficient division method to decompose a manifold into ordered continuous
maximal linear patches (CMLPs) that denote meaningful action snippets of the
action sequence. Then the CMLP is represented by its position (average value of
points) and the first principal component, which specify the major posture and
main evolving direction of an action snippet, respectively. Finally, we compute
the distance between CMLPs by taking both the posture and direction into
consideration. Based on these preparations, an intuitive distance measure that
preserves the local order of action snippets is proposed to compute AMMD. The
performance on two benchmark datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the
proposed approach.

peculiar spectral disturbances in intensity with specific morphology, so-called
Spectral Caustics (SCs), occasionally appearing in dynamic spectra of different
solar radio instruments operating in the meter-decameter wavelength range. We
show that the simulated spectral shapes of SCs are in good agreement with the
ones detected in real solar radio spectrograms. In particular, SCs that are
classified as inverted V-like, V-like, X-like, and fiber-like types have been
reproduced. It is also found that the seasonal dependence in the occurrence of
SCs, which has been discovered recently, can be understood through a strong
relation between the focusing frequency - the most important characteristic
point in most SCs patterns - and the elevation angle of the Sun. We find that
under typical parameters of MSTIDs with spatial and temporal periods set to be

growth of the elevation angle. Physical interpretations of the results and

method on the space of models (in the sense of Hairer), which generalizes
classical works of Azencott and Ben Arous on path space and then Aida,
Inahama--Kawabi on rough path space. When applied to rough volatility models,
e.g. in the setting of [Forde-Zhang, Asymptotics for rough stochastic

which refine known large deviation asymptotics.

  Recognition",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we aim to address the problem of human interaction recognition
in videos by exploring the long-term inter-related dynamics among multiple
persons. Recently, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has become a popular choice to
model individual dynamic for single-person action recognition due to its
ability of capturing the temporal motion information in a range. However,
existing RNN models focus only on capturing the dynamics of human interaction
by simply combining all dynamics of individuals or modeling them as a whole.
Such models neglect the inter-related dynamics of how human interactions change
over time. To this end, we propose a novel Hierarchical Long Short-Term
Concurrent Memory (H-LSTCM) to model the long-term inter-related dynamics among
a group of persons for recognizing the human interactions. Specifically, we
first feed each person's static features into a Single-Person LSTM to learn the
single-person dynamic. Subsequently, the outputs of all Single-Person LSTM
units are fed into a novel Concurrent LSTM (Co-LSTM) unit, which mainly
consists of multiple sub-memory units, a new cell gate and a new co-memory
cell. In a Co-LSTM unit, each sub-memory unit stores individual motion
information, while this Co-LSTM unit selectively integrates and stores
inter-related motion information between multiple interacting persons from
multiple sub-memory units via the cell gate and co-memory cell, respectively.
Extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness of the
proposed H-LSTCM by comparing against baseline and state-of-the-art methods.

little coordination and communication between D2D pairs. Specifically, we
decompose the original problem into two cascaded subproblems, namely channel
allocation and power control. The cascaded structure of our scheme enables us
to cope with them respectively. Then a two-stage algorithm is proposed. In the
first stage, we model the channel allocation problem as a many-to-one matching
with externalities and try to find a strongly swap-stable matching. In the
second stage, we adopt a pricing mechanism and develop an iterative two-step

distribution differences, which typically requires a sophisticated alternate
optimization process, either in the form of \emph{minmax game} or intermediate

hard and unstable. In order to avoid such sophisticated alternate optimization,

Such codes generalize stabilizer QLDPC codes, which are exact quantum
error-correcting codes with sparse, low-weight stabilizer generators (i.e. each
stabilizer generator acts on a few qubits, and each qubit participates in a few
stabilizer generators). Our investigation is motivated by an important question
in Hamiltonian complexity and quantum coding theory: do stabilizer QLDPC codes
with constant rate, linear distance, and constant-weight stabilizers exist?
  We show that obtaining such optimal scaling of parameters (modulo
polylogarithmic corrections) is possible if we go beyond stabilizer codes: we
prove the existence of a family of $[[N,k,d,\varepsilon]]$ approximate QLDPC
codes that encode $k = \widetilde{\Omega}(N)$ logical qubits into $N$ physical
qubits with distance $d = \widetilde{\Omega}(N)$ and approximation infidelity
$\varepsilon = \mathcal{O}(1/\textrm{polylog}(N))$. The code space is
stabilized by a set of 10-local noncommuting projectors, with each physical
qubit only participating in $\mathcal{O}(\textrm{polylog} N)$ projectors. We
prove the existence of an efficient encoding map, and we show that arbitrary
Pauli errors can be locally detected by circuits of polylogarithmic depth.
Finally, we show that the spectral gap of the code Hamiltonian is
$\widetilde{\Omega}(N^{-3.09})$ by analyzing a spacetime circuit-to-Hamiltonian
construction for a bitonic sorting network architecture that is spatially local

to stably propagate signals in deep networks, while using an initialisation
disregarding noise fails to do so. Furthermore, we analyse correlation dynamics
between inputs. Stronger noise regularisation is shown to reduce the depth to
which discriminatory information about the inputs to a noisy ReLU network is
able to propagate, even when initialised at criticality. We support our

photoevaporation of molecular gas clumps illuminated by external massive stars.
We study the fate of solar-mass clumps and derive their lifetimes with varying
the gas metallicity over a range of $10^{-3} \,Z_\odot \leq Z \leq Z_\odot $.
Our simulations incorporate radiation transfer of far ultraviolet (FUV) and
extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photons, and follow atomic/molecular line cooling and
dust-gas collisional cooling. Nonequilibrium chemistry is coupled with the
radiative transfer and hydrodynamics in a self-consistent manner. We show that
radiation-driven shocks compress gas clumps to have a volume that is set by the
pressure-equilibrium with the hot ambient gas. Radiative cooling enables
metal-rich clumps to condense and to have small surface areas, where
photoevaporative flows are launched. For our fiducial set-up with an O-type
star at a distance of 0.1 parsec, the resulting photoevaporation rate is as
small as $\sim 10^{-5} M_{\odot}/{\rm yr}$ for metal-rich clumps, but is larger
for metal-poor clumps that have larger surface areas. The clumps are
continuously accelerated away from the radiation source by the so-called rocket
effect, and can travel over $\sim$1 parsec within the lifetime. We also study
photoevaporation of clumps in a photo-dissociation region. Photoelectric
heating is inefficient for metal-poor clumps that contain a smaller amount of
grains, and thus they survive for over $10^5$ years. We conclude that the gas
metallicity strongly affects the clump lifetime and thus determines the
strength of feedback from massive stars in star-forming regions.

However, the production of datasets with strong labels normally requires

methods. The recent advances in SED approaches focuses on detecting sound
events by taking advantages of weakly labeled or unlabeled training data. In
this paper, we propose a joint framework to solve the SED task using
large-scale unlabeled in-domain data. In particular, a state-of-the-art general

data. On the other hand, a weakly supervised architecture based on the
convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) is developed to solve the strong
annotations of sound events with the aid of the unlabeled data with predicted
labels. It is found that the SED performance generally increases as more
unlabeled data is added into the training. To address the noisy label problem
of unlabeled data, an ensemble strategy is applied to increase the system
robustness. The proposed system is evaluated on the SED dataset of DCASE 2018

variable is partly ambiguous. We assume the ambiguity lies on the level of the

Furthermore, a current best guess for the distribution, called reference
measure, is available. We work with the set of distributions that are both
close to the given reference measure in a transportation distance (e.g. the
Wasserstein distance), and additionally have the correct marginal structure.
The goal is to find upper and lower bounds for integrals of interest with
respect to distributions in this set. The described problem appears naturally
in the context of risk aggregation. When aggregating different risks, the
marginal distributions of these risks are known and the task is to quantify
their joint effect on a given system. This is typically done by applying a
meaningful risk measure to the sum of the individual risks. For this purpose,
the stochastic interdependencies between the risks need to be specified. In
practice the models of this dependence structure are however subject to
relatively high model ambiguity. The contribution of this paper is twofold:
Firstly, we derive a dual representation of the considered problem and prove
that strong duality holds. Secondly, we propose a generally applicable and
computationally feasible method, which relies on neural networks, in order to
numerically solve the derived dual problem. The latter method is tested on a
number of toy examples, before it is finally applied to perform robust risk
aggregation in a real world instance.

is characterised by the presence of a large eigengap (increasing with $n$)
between the $r$-th and the $(r+1)$-th largest eigenvalues of the covariance
matrix. Consequently, Principal Component (PC) analysis is the most popular
estimation method for factor models and its consistency, when $r$ is correctly
estimated, is well-established in the literature. However, popular factor
number estimators often suffer from the lack of an obvious eigengap in
empirical eigenvalues and tend to over-estimate $r$ due, for example, to the
existence of non-pervasive factors affecting only a subset of the series. We
show that the errors in the PC estimators resulting from the over-estimation of
$r$ are non-negligible, which in turn lead to the violation of the conditions
required for factor-based large covariance estimation. To remedy this, we
propose new estimators of the factor model based on scaling the entries of the
sample eigenvectors. We show both theoretically and numerically that the
proposed estimators successfully control for the over-estimation error, and

in advanced LIGO detectors. Coefficients characterizing the spin-induced
multipole moments of Kerr black holes are predicted by the ""no-hair"" conjecture
and appear in the gravitational waveforms through quadratic and higher order

observations. We assess the capabilities of the third-generation gravitational

out such measurements and use them to test the binary black hole nature of
observed binaries. In this paper, we extend the investigations of our previous
work, by proposing to measure (a) spin-induced quadrupole effects, (b)
simultaneous measurements of spin-induced quadrupole and octupole effects, in
the context of the third-generation detectors. We find that, using
third-generation detectors the symmetric combination of coefficients associated
with spin-induced quadrupole moment of each binary component may be constrained
to a value $\leq 1.1$ while a similar combination of coefficients for
spin-induced octupole moment may be constrained to $\leq 2$, where both
combinations take the value of 1 for a binary black hole system. Further, we
consider two different binary black hole populations, as proxies of the
population that will be observed by the third generation detectors, and obtain
the resulting distribution of the spin-induced quadrupole coefficient. These
estimates suggest that third-generation detectors can accurately constrain the

fluids defined by second Legendre transform was derived as a functional of
density-density correlation function. It is now becoming an increasingly
significant issue to develop the correlation functional theory that encompasses
the liquid state theory, especially for glassy systems where out of equilibrium
correlation fields are to be investigated. Here we have formulated a field
theoretic perturbation theory that incorporates two-body fields (both of
density-density correlation field and its dual field playing the role of
two-body interaction potential) into a density functional integral
representation of the Helmholtz free energy. Quadratic density fluctuations are
only considered in the saddle-point approximation of two-body fields as well as
density field. We have obtained a set of self-consistent field equations with
respect to these fields, which simply reads a modified mean-field equation of
density field where the bare interaction potential in the thermal energy unit
is replaced by minus the direct correlation function given in the mean
spherical approximation. Such replacement of the interaction potential in the
mean-field equation belongs to the same category as the local molecular field
theory proposed by Weeks and co-workers. Notably, it has been shown that even
the mean-field part of the free energy functional given by the self-consistent
field theory includes information on short-range correlations between fluid
particles, similarly to the formulation of the local molecular field theory.
The advantage of our field theoretic approach is not only that the modified
mean-field equation can be improved systematically, but also that fluctuations
of two-body fields in nonuniform fluids may be considered, which would be
relevant especially for glass-forming liquids.

condition that depends on the L\'evy measure of the noise and the growth and
concentration properties of the sequence at the same time. Finally, we show

stiffness equations to maintain its consistency with changes to the underlying
model without refactorization at each timestep. As changes accumulate over
multiple simulation timesteps, the augmented solution algorithm enables tens or

state theory are quite different from each other. Here we clarified the gap
between the MSA and HNC functionals by developing a field theoretic description
of the correlation functional theory that combines the variational principle of
lower bound free energy, the conventional saddle-point approximation of a
reference system to be optimized based on the variational principle, and the
hybrid treatment of the saddle-point approximation and the fugacity expansion
for modifying the primary optimization. Our formulation demonstrates that the
MSA functional is reproduced by the first maximization of the variational
functional in the saddle-point approximation, and that the HNC functional is
obtained from the improved maximization of the virial term due to the fugacity
expansion around the MSA functional. The virial term leads to the modification
of a reference system interacting via the direct correlation function, thereby
creating the correlation entropy difference.

most efficient photocatalyst for facilitating redox reactions. However, due to
the absence of adequate understanding of the mechanism of adsorption, the

anatase TiO$_2$ (101) is the most stable facet, the (001) surface is more

functional calculations we have investigated the CO$_2$ adsorption on TiO$_2$

explains the mechanism of chemisorption, leading to the formation of a
tridentate carbonate complex. The electronic structure analysis reveals that
the CO$_2$-TiO$_2$ interaction at the surface is uniaxial and long ranged,
which gives rise to anisotropy in binding energy (BE). It negates the widely
perceived one-to-one correspondence between coverage and BE and infers that the
spatial distribution of CO$_2$ primarily determines the BE. A conceptual
experiment is devised where the CO$_2$ concentration and flow direction can be
controlled to tune the BE within a large window of ~1.5 eV. The experiment also
reveals that a maximum of 50% coverage can be achieved for chemisorption. In
the presence of water, the activated carbonate complex forms a bicarbonate
complex by overcoming a potential barrier of ~0.9 eV.

success for image super-resolution (SR). However, most deep CNN based SR models
attempt to improve distortion measures (e.g. PSNR, SSIM, IFC, VIF) while
resulting in poor quantified perceptual quality (e.g. human opinion score,
no-reference quality measures such as NIQE). Few works have attempted to
improve the perceptual quality at the cost of performance reduction in
distortion measures. A very recent study has revealed that distortion and
perceptual quality are at odds with each other and there is always a trade-off
between the two. Often the restoration algorithms that are superior in terms of
perceptual quality, are inferior in terms of distortion measures. Our work
attempts to analyze the trade-off between distortion and perceptual quality for
the problem of single image SR. To this end, we use the well-known SR
architecture-enhanced deep super-resolution (EDSR) network and show that it can
be adapted to achieve better perceptual quality for a specific range of the
distortion measure. While the original network of EDSR was trained to minimize
the error defined based on per-pixel accuracy alone, we train our network using
a generative adversarial network framework with EDSR as the generator module.
Our proposed network, called enhanced perceptual super-resolution network
(EPSR), is trained with a combination of mean squared error loss, perceptual
loss, and adversarial loss. Our experiments reveal that EPSR achieves the
state-of-the-art trade-off between distortion and perceptual quality while the
existing methods perform well in either of these measures alone.

group's Maurer-Cartan forms. This result, when combined with the fundamental
recurrence formulas for the moving frame for pseudo-groups, will allow for a
hybrid equivalence method that will extend and illuminate its two progenitors.
Furthermore, incorporating the recurrence formula from the equivariant moving
frame calculus provides great computational simplifications in solving
equivalence problems.
  We apply the method to substantial equivalence problems such as (point)
equivalence of second order ordinary differential equations, (point) divergence
equivalence of Lagrangians on the line and equivalence of linear second order
differential operators. These examples will demonstrate the ease with which the
combined equivalence method can solve such problems.

relatively stable orbits, in 1:1 MMR with Jupiter. However, not all of them lie
in orbits that remain stable over the age of the Solar System. Unstable zones
allow some Trojans to escape in time scales shorter than the Solar System age.
This may contribute to populate other small body populations. In this paper, we
study this process by performing long-term numerical simulations of the
observed Trojans, focusing on the trajectories of those that leave the
resonance. The orbits of current Trojans are taken as initial conditions and
their evolution is followed under the gravitational action of the Sun and the
planets. We find the rate of escape of Trojans from L5, ~1.1 times greater than
from L4. The majority of escaped Trojans have encounters with Jupiter although
they have encounters with the other planets too. Almost all escaped Trojans
reach the comet zone, ~90% cross the Centaur zone and only L4 Trojans reach the
transneptunian zone. Considering the real asymmetry between L4 and L5, we show
that 18 L4 Trojans and 14 L5 Trojans with diameter D > 1 km are ejected from
the resonance every Myr. The contribution of the escaped Trojans to other minor
body populations would be negligible, being the contribution from L4 and L5 to
JFCs and no-JFCs almost the same, and the L4 contribution to Centaurs and TNOs,
orders of magnitude greater than that of L5. Considering the collisional
removal, besides the dynamical one, and assuming that Trojans that escape due
to collisions follow the same dynamical behavior that the ones removed by
dynamics, we would have a minor contribution of Trojans to comets and Centaurs.
However, there would be some specific regions were escaped Trojans could be
important such as ACOs, Encke-type comets, S-L 9-type impacts on Jupiter and
NEOs.

two-dimensional linear heat transfer problems with localized moving heat
source, as simplified models for additive manufacturing applications. We first
verify the accuracy of the admissible adaptive scheme with respect to an
overkilled solution, for then comparing our results with similar schemes which
consider different refinement and coarsening algorithms, with or without taking
into account grading parameters. This study shows that the THB-spline
admissible solution delivers an optimal discretization for what concerns not
only the accuracy of the approximation, but also the (reduced) number of
degrees of freedom per time step. In the last example we investigate the
capability of the algorithms to approximate the thermal history of the problem
for a more complicated source path. The comparison with uniform and
non-admissible hierarchical meshes demonstrates that also in this case our
adaptive scheme returns the desired accuracy while strongly improving the
computational efficiency.

each stage of the game they simultaneously bid some part of their current

many models of the red-and-black game it is assumed that the win probability is
a function of the quotient of the bid of the first player and the sum of both

super-multiplicativity are assumed in order to ensure that bold and timid

which the probability of winning is a two-variable function which depends on

extend these approaches to 3D using Fourier transform on the Lie group $SE(3)$

$\alpha$-stable L\'{e}vy processes on $\mathbb{R}^{3}\rtimes S^{2}$. This
reduces classical analysis computations and provides an explicit algebraic
spectral decomposition of the solutions. We compare the exact probability
kernel for $\alpha = 1$ (the diffusion kernel) to the kernel for

wave signal from a binary neutron star inspiral has enabled tests of general
relativity (GR) with this new type of source. This source, for the first time,
permits tests of strong-field dynamics of compact binaries in presence of
matter. In this paper, we place constraints on the dipole radiation and
possible deviations from GR in the post-Newtonian coefficients that govern the
inspiral regime. Bounds on modified dispersion of gravitational waves are
obtained; in combination with information from the observed electromagnetic
counterpart we can also constrain effects due to large extra dimensions.
Finally, the polarization content of the gravitational wave signal is studied.
The results of all tests performed here show good agreement with GR.

the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) DR5.
This library represents a uniform data set ranging from 3750 through 8500K in
effective temperature (T_eff), from -2.5 through +1.0 dex in metallicity
([Fe/H]), and from 0 to 5.0 dex in gravity (log g). The spectra in the library
have resolution R~1800, with well-calibrated fluxes and rest-framed
wavelengths. Using a large number of red stars observed by LAMOST, we generated
denser K type templates to fill in data missing from current empirical spectral
libraries, particularly the late K type. For K giants, we calibrated the
spectroscopic surface gravities against the asteroseismic surface gravities. To
verify the reliability of the parameters labeled for this library, we performed
an internal cross-validation by using a chi^2 minimization method to
interpolate parameters of each individual spectrum using the remaining spectra
in the library. We obtained precisions of 41 K, 0.11 dex, and 0.05 dex for
T_eff, log g, and [Fe/H], respectively, which means the templates are labeled
with correct stellar parameters. Through external comparisons, we confirmed
that measurements of the stellar parameters through this library can achieve
accuracies of approximately 125K in T_eff, 0.1 dex in [Fe/H] and 0.20 dex in
log g without systematic offset. This empirical library is useful for stellar
parameter measurements because it has large parameter coverage and full
wavelength coverage from 3800 to 8900A.

solidification, the topological origins of the thermal transport properties of
crystalline and non-crystalline solid states are considered herein. Global
orientational order, achieved by spontaneous symmetry breaking, is prevented at
finite temperatures for systems that exist in restricted dimensions
(Mermin-Wagner theorem). Just as complex ordered systems exist in restricted
dimensions in 2D and 1D, owing to the dimensionality of the order parameter,
quaternion ordered systems in 4D and 3D exist in restricted dimensions. Just
below the melting temperature, misorientational fluctuations in the form of
spontaneously generated topological defects prevent the development of the
solid state. Such solidifying systems are well-described using O(4) quantum
rotor models, and a defect-driven Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)
transition is anticipated to separate an undercooled fluid from a crystalline
solid state. In restricted dimensions, in addition to orientationally-ordered
ground states, orientationally-disordered ground states may be realized by
tuning a non-thermal parameter in the relevant O(n) quantum rotor model
Hamiltonian; thus, glassy solid states are anticipated to exist as distinct
ground states of O(4) quantum rotor models. Within this topological framework
for solidification, the finite Kauzmann temperature marks a first-order
transition between crystalline and glassy solid states at a ""self-dual critical
point"" that belongs to O(4) quantum rotor models. This transition is a
higher-dimensional analogue to the quantum phase transition that belongs to
O(2) Josephson junction arrays (JJAs). Thermal transport properties of
crystalline and glassy solid states, above approximately 50 K, are considered
alongside electrical transport properties of JJAs across the
superconductor-to-superinsulator transition.

(SR) algorithms. Usually, they are evaluated by some well-known objective
metrics, e.g., PSNR and SSIM, but these indices cannot provide suitable results
in accordance with the perception of human being. Recently, a more reasonable
perception measurement has been proposed in [1], which is also adopted by the
PIRM-SR 2018 challenge. In this paper, motivated by [1], we aim to generate a
high-quality SR result which balances between the two indices, i.e., the
perception index and root-mean-square error (RMSE). To do so, we design a new
deep SR framework, dubbed Bi-GANs-ST, by integrating two complementary
generative adversarial networks (GAN) branches. One is memory residual SRGAN
(MR-SRGAN), which emphasizes on improving the objective performance, such as
reducing the RMSE. The other is weight perception SRGAN (WP-SRGAN), which
obtains the result that favors better subjective perception via a two-stage
adversarial training mechanism. Then, to produce final result with excellent
perception scores and RMSE, we use soft-thresholding method to merge the
results generated by the two GANs. Our method performs well on the perceptual
image super-resolution task of the PIRM 2018 challenge. Experimental results on

  Vortices in High-speed Boundary Layers","23 pages",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  G\""{o}rtler vortices in boundary layer flows over concave surfaces are caused
by the imbalance between centrifugal effects and radial pressure gradients.
Depending on various geometrical and/or freestream flow conditions, vortex
breakdown via secondary instabilities leads to early transition to turbulence.
It is desirable, therefore, to reduce vortex energy in an attempt to delay the
transition from laminar to turbulent flow, and thereby achieve a reduced
frictional drag. To this end, we apply a proportional control algorithm aimed
at reducing the wall shear stress and the energy of G\""{o}rtler vortices
evolving in high-speed boundary layers. The active control scheme is based on
wall transpiration with sensors placed either in the flow or at the wall. In
addition, we evaluate the effect of wall cooling and heating on G\""{o}rtler
vortices evolving in high-speed boundary layers, by reducing or increasing the
upstream wall temperature. The numerical results are obtained by solving the
full Navier-Stokes equations in generalized curvilinear coordinates, using a
high-order numerical algorithm. Our results show that the active control based
on wall transpiration reduces both the wall shear stress and the energy of the
G\""{o}rtler vortices; the passive control based on wall cooling or heating
reduces the wall shear stress, but slightly increases the energy of the
vortices in both supersonic and hypersonic regimes.

the perturbations are modeled by partially random matrices is presented. We
furthermore develop a simple heuristic, mathematical scheme that describes the

delivered dose from the prescribed dose distribution. To better handle these
uncertainties during treatment, the authors propose a dynamic framework for
robust adaptive radiation therapy in which a variety of robust adaptive
treatment strategies are introduced and evaluated. This variety is a result of
optimization variables with various degrees of freedom within robust
optimization models that vary in their grade of conservativeness. We formulate
an adaptive framework with dependence on time and/or uncertainty or neither.
The framework is evaluated with either expected-value-, worst-case-, or
conditional-value-at-risk-(CVaR)-optimization. The goal of this study is to
identify the mathematical properties of the proposed robust adaptive strategies
in order to restore the planned dose distribution. We apply a result from
convex analysis to show that in our framework, the time-dependent problem has a
time-independent optimal solution. This implies that the time-dependent problem
can be solved by dynamically solving the corresponding time-independent
problem. This is especially relevant in a clinical context, since it implies
that adaptive radiation therapy can be implemented in clinical practice using
commercially available treatment planning systems. We demonstrate that
time-and-scenario-dependent variables are most compatible with
worst-case-optimization and that including dose prediction potentially improves
treatment compared to non-adaptive planning. Contrarily,
time-and-scenario-independent variables appear most compatible with
expected-value-optimization. Non-adaptive robust strategies may provide
sufficient target coverage, comparable to robust adaptive strategies, if the
occurring uncertainties follow the same distribution as those included in the
robust model.

to fundamentally new topological states of light.Current

to achieve topological transport of photons whose propagation is predetermined
by either 'photonic pseudospin' (abbreviated as 'spin') or valley. Here we
demonstrate a new class of PTIs, whose topological phase is not determined
solely by spin or valley, but is controlled by the competition between their
induced gauge fields. Such a competition is enabled by tuning the strengths of
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and inversion-symmetry breaking in a single PTI. An
unprecedented topological transition between QSH and QVH phases that is hard to
achieve in condensed-matter systems is demonstrated. Our study merges the
emerging fields of spintronics and valleytronics in the same photonic platform,

calcium in oxygen-neon nova ejecta and those predicted by nova models. An
improved characterization of the $^{38}$K($p, \gamma$)$^{39}$Ca reaction rate
over the nova temperature regime ($\sim$ 0.1 -- 0.4 GK), and thus the nuclear
structure of $^{39}$Ca above the proton threshold (5770.92(63) keV), is
necessary to resolve these contradictions.
  Purpose: The present study was performed to search for low-spin proton
resonances in the $^{38}$K $+$ $p$ system, and to improve the uncertainties in
energies of the known astrophysically significant proton resonances in
$^{39}$Ca.
  Method: The level structure of $^{39}$Ca was investigated via high-resolution
charged-particle spectroscopy with an Enge split-pole spectrograph using the
$^{40}$Ca($^{3}$He, $\alpha$)$^{39}$Ca reaction. Differential cross sections
were measured over 6 laboratory angles at 21 MeV. Distorted-wave Born
approximation calculations were performed to constrain the spin-parity
assignments of observed levels with special attention to those significant in
determination of the $^{38}$K($p, \gamma$)$^{39}$Ca reaction rate over the nova
temperature regime.
  Results: The resonance energies corresponding to two out of three
astrophysically important states at 6154(5) and 6472.2(24) keV are measured
with better precision than previous charged-particle spectroscopy measurements.
A tentatively new state is discovered at 5908(3) keV. The spin-parity
assignments of a few of the astrophysically important resonances are
determined.
  Conclusions: The present $^{38}$K($p, \gamma$)$^{39}$Ca upper limit
thermonuclear reaction rate at 0.1 -- 0.4 GK is higher than that determined in
[Physical Review C 97 (2018) 025802] by at most a factor of 1.4 at 0.1 GK.

changes of their input, as is well-known from epsilon-adversarial examples, but
are also too invariant to a wide range of task-relevant changes, thus making
vast regions in input space vulnerable to adversarial attacks. We show such
excessive invariance occurs across various tasks and architecture types. On
MNIST and ImageNet one can manipulate the class-specific content of almost any
image without changing the hidden activations. We identify an insufficiency of
the standard cross-entropy loss as a reason for these failures. Further, we
extend this objective based on an information-theoretic analysis so it
encourages the model to consider all task-dependent features in its decision.
This provides the first approach tailored explicitly to overcome excessive

pressure of ~23.8 GPa. Then, the TC value increases with pressure and reaches
~2.1 K at 65.7 GPa. In situ high-pressure Hall coefficient (RH) measurements at
low temperatures demonstrate that the positive RH increases with pressure until
the critical pressure of the superconducting transition is reached, but starts
to decrease upon further increasing pressure. Above the critical pressure, the
positive magnetoresistance effect disappears simultaneously. Our high pressure
X-ray diffraction measurements reveal that, at around the critical pressure the
lattice of the TaIrTe4 sample is distorted by the application of pressure and
its volume is reduced by ~19.2%, the value of which is predicted to result in
the change of the electronic structure significantly. We propose that the
pressure-induced distortion in TaIrTe4 is responsible for the change of
topology of Fermi surface and such a change favors the emergence of
superconductivity. Our results clearly demonstrate the correlation among the
lattice distortion, topological physics and superconductivity in the WSM.

enhanced symmetry in the limit of degenerate (s)leptons is the nondecoupling of
the radiative contribution of heavy charged sleptons, appearing in SUSY, to the
$\gamma - Z^\prime$ kinetic mixing. The signal process, $e^+ e^- \rightarrow
\gamma Z^\prime \rightarrow \gamma + E \hspace{-.5em}/\;\:$, is an outcome of
this ubiquitous feature. We take into account the severe constraints on gauged
$U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ models by several low-energy observables and show
that any significant excess in all but the highest photon energy bin would be
an undeniable signature of such heavy scalar fields in SUSY coupling to
$Z^\prime$. The number of signal events depends crucially on the logarithm of
the ratio of stau to smuon mass in the presence of SUSY. In addition, the
number is also inversely proportional to the $e^+-e^-$ collision energy, making
a low-energy, high-luminosity collider like Belle-II an ideal testing ground
for this channel. This process can probe large swathes of the slepton mass
ratio vs the additional gauge coupling ($g_X$) parameter space. More
importantly, it can explore the narrow slice of $M_{Z^{\prime}}-g_X$ parameter
space still allowed in gauged $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ models for superheavy

a recently proposed Peierls--Nabarro Finite Element (PN-FE) model for
dislocations by a direct comparison with an equivalent molecular statics
simulation. To this end, a two-dimensional microstructural specimen subjected
to simple shear is considered, consisting of a central soft phase flanked by
two hard-phase regions. A hexagonal atomic structure with equal lattice spacing
is adopted, the interactions of which are described by the Lennard--Jones
potential with phase specific depths of its energy well. During loading, edge
dislocation dipoles centred in the soft phase are introduced, which progress
towards the phase boundaries, where they pile up. Under a sufficiently high
external shear load, the leading dislocation is eventually transmitted into the
harder phase. The homogenized PN-FE model is calibrated to an atomistic model
in terms of effective elasticity constants and glide plane properties as
obtained from simple uniform deformations. To study the influence of different
formulations of the glide plane potential, multiple approaches are employed,
ranging from a simple sinusoidal function of the tangential disregistry to a
complex model that couples the influence of the tangential and the normal
disregistries. The obtained results show that, qualitatively, the dislocation
structure, displacement, strain fields, and the dislocation evolution are
captured adequately. The simplifications of the PN-FE model lead, however, to
some discrepancies within the dislocation core. Such discrepancies play a
dominant role in the dislocation transmission process, which thus cannot
quantitatively be captured properly. Despite its simplicity, the PN-FE model
proves to be an elegant tool for a qualitative study of edge dislocation
behaviour in two-phase microstructures, although it may not be quantitatively
predictive.

communication links to control a series of independent wireless control
systems. Low-latency transmissions are necessary in enabling time-sensitive
control systems to operate over wireless links with high reliability. Achieving
fast data rates over wireless links thus comes at the cost of reliability in
the form of high packet error rates compared to wired links due to channel
noise and interference. However, the effect of the communication link errors on
the control system performance depends dynamically on the control system state.
We propose a novel control-communication co-design approach to the low-latency
resource allocation problem. We incorporate control and channel state
information to make scheduling decisions over time on frequency, bandwidth and
data rates across the next-generation Wi-Fi based wireless communication links
that close the control loops. Control systems that are closer to instability or
further from a desired range in a given control cycle are given higher packet
delivery rate targets to meet. Rather than a simple priority ranking, we derive
precise packet error rate targets for each system needed to satisfy stability
targets and make scheduling decisions to meet such targets while reducing total
transmission time. The resulting Control-Aware Low Latency Scheduling (CALLS)
method is tested in numerous simulation experiments that demonstrate its
effectiveness in meeting control-based goals under tight latency constraints

$\alpha$-decay energies, which requires accurate calculations of $Q_{\alpha}$
values. While many $Q_{\alpha}$ predictions are available, little is known
about their uncertainties, and this makes it difficult to carry out
extrapolations to yet-unknown systems.
  This work aims to analyze several models, compare their predictions to
available experimental data, and study their performance for the unobserved
$\alpha$-decay chains of $^{296}$120 and $^{298}$120, which are of current
experimental interest. Our quantified results will also serve as a benchmark
for future, more sophisticated statistical studies.
  We use nuclear superfluid Density Functional Theory (DFT) with several Skyrme
energy density functionals (EDFs). To estimate systematic model uncertainties
we employ uniform model averaging.
  We evaluated the $Q_{\alpha}$ values for even-even nuclei from Fm to $Z=120$.
For well deformed nuclei between Fm and Ds, we find excellent consistency
between different model predictions, and a good agreement with experiment. For
transitional nuclei beyond Ds, inter-model differences grow, resulting in an
appreciable systematic error. In particular, our models underestimate
$Q_{\alpha}$ for the heaviest nucleus $^{294}$Og.
  The robustness of DFT predictions for well deformed superheavy nuclei
supports the idea of using experimental $Q_{\alpha}$ values, together with
theoretical predictions, as reasonable $(Z,A)$ indicators. Unfortunately, this
identification method is not expected to work well in the region of
deformed-to-spherical shape transition as one approaches $N=184$. The use of
$Q_{\alpha}$ values in the identification of new superheavy nuclei will benefit
greatly from both progress in developing new spectroscopic-quality EDFs and
more sophisticated statistical techniques of uncertainty quantification.

thus is proposed to protect individual privacy on social networks. Here, we
introduce and formalize the problem of community detection attack and develop
efficient strategies to attack community detection algorithms by rewiring a
small number of connections, leading to individual privacy protection. In
particular, we first give two heuristic attack strategies, i.e., Community
Detection Attack (CDA) and Degree Based Attack (DBA), as baselines, utilizing
the information of detected community structure and node degree, respectively.
And then we propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based Q-Attack, where the
modularity Q is used to design the fitness function. We launch community
detection attack based on the above three strategies against three modularity
based community detection algorithms on two social networks. By comparison, our
Q-Attack method achieves much better attack effects than CDA and DBA, in terms
of the larger reduction of both modularity Q and Normalized Mutual Information
(NMI). Besides, we find that the adversarial networks obtained by Q-Attack on a
specific community detection algorithm can be still effective on others, no
matter whether they are modularity based or not, indicating its strong
transferability.

However, just learning from covariant constraint can lead to detection of
unstable features. To impart further, stability detectors are trained to
extract pre-determined features obtained by hand-crafted detectors. However, in
the process they lose the ability to detect novel features. In an attempt to
overcome the above limitations, we propose an improved scheme by incorporating
covariant constraints in form of triplets with addition to an affine covariant

detect novel and stable features without using pre-determined features for

have been ejected from their parent systems. Although they emit little or no
light, they can be detected during gravitational microlensing events.
Microlensing events caused by rogue planets are characterized by very short
timescales $t_{\rm E}$ (typically below two days) and small angular Einstein
radii $\theta_{\rm E}$ (up to several uas). Here we present the discovery and
characterization of two ultra-short microlensing events identified in data from
the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey, which may have been
caused by free-floating or wide-orbit planets. OGLE-2012-BLG-1323 is one of the
shortest events discovered thus far ($t_{\rm E}$=0.155 +/- 0.005 d,
$\theta_{\rm E}$=2.37 +/- 0.10 uas) and was caused by an Earth-mass object in
the Galactic disk or a Neptune-mass planet in the Galactic bulge.
OGLE-2017-BLG-0560 ($t_{\rm E}$=0.905 +/- 0.005 d, $\theta_{\rm E}$=38.7 +/-
1.6 uas) was caused by a Jupiter-mass planet in the Galactic disk or a brown
dwarf in the bulge. We rule out stellar companions up to a distance of 6.0 and
3.9 au, respectively. We suggest that the lensing objects, whether located on
very wide orbits or free-floating, may originate from the same physical
mechanism. Although the sample of ultrashort microlensing events is small,
these detections are consistent with low-mass wide-orbit or unbound planets
being more common than stars in the Milky Way.

electrons systems such as magnetic materials, strongly correlated systems and
superconductors is replaced by motion of that in an effective medium which is
denoted by self-energy. The study of disordered alloy and interacting electrons
systems based on single electron motion is an old challenge and an important
problem in condensed matter physics. In this paper we introduce a real space
approximation beyond super cell approximation for the study of these systems to
capture multi-site effects. Average disordered alloy or interacting system is
replaced by a self-energy, $\Sigma(i,j,E)$. We divided self-energy in q-space
$\Sigma({\bf q}; E)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{ij}e^{i{\bf q}.{\bf r}_{ij}}\Sigma(i,j;
E)$ into two parts $\Sigma({\bf q}; E)=\frac{1}{N_{c}}\sum_{IJ\in\; \mbox{\tiny

\:\mbox{\tiny same cluster}}e^{i{\bf q}.{\bf r}_{IJ}}\Sigma(I,J,E)$ where
$\{Lc_{1}, Lc_{2},Lc_{3}\}$ are dimensions of the super cell. We show that
neglecting the second term of q-space self-energy leads to super cell
approximation $e^{iq_{j} Lc_{j}}=1$, hence $ q_{j}$ determined by $ q_{j}
Lc_{j}=2\pi n_{j}$. Then we kept this correction in the second step to add self
energies of sites in different super cells which leads to fully q-dependent
self energy in the first Brillouin zone (FBZ). Our self-energy in FBZ is
casual, fully q-dependent, and continuous with respect to ${\bf q}$. It
recovers coherent potential approximation in the single site approximation and
is exact when the number of sites in the super cell approaches to the total
number of lattice sites. We illustrate that this approximation undertakes
electrons localization for one and two dimensional alloy systems which isn't
observed by previous multi site approximations.

  Circuits",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Circuits play a fundamental role in polyhedral theory and linear programming.
For instance, circuits are used as step directions in various augmentation
schemes for solving linear programs or to leave degenerate vertices while
running the simplex method. However, there are significant challenges when
implementing these approaches: The set of circuits of a polyhedron may be of
exponential size and is highly sensitive to the representation of the
polyhedron.
  In this paper, we provide a universal framework for enumerating the set of
circuits and optimizing over sets of circuits of a polyhedron in any
representation - we propose a polyhedral model in which the circuits of the
original polyhedron are encoded as extreme rays or vertices. Many methods in
the literature and software assume that a polyhedron is in standard form; our
framework is a direct generalization. We demonstrate its value by showing that
the conversion of a general representation to standard form may introduce
exponentially many new circuits.
  We then discuss the main advantages of the generalized polyhedral model. It
enables the direct enumeration of useful subsets of circuits such as strictly
feasible circuits or sign-compatible circuits, as well as optimization over
these sets. In particular, this leads to the efficient computation of a
steepest-descent circuit, which can be used in an augmentation scheme for
solving linear programs or the construction of sign-compatible circuit walks

  Learning","12",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Caricature generation is an interesting yet challenging task. The primary
goal is to generate plausible caricatures with reasonable exaggerations given
face images. Conventional caricature generation approaches mainly use low-level
geometric transformations such as image warping to generate exaggerated images,
which lack richness and diversity in terms of content and style. The recent
progress in generative adversarial networks (GANs) makes it possible to learn
an image-to-image transformation from data, so that richer contents and styles
can be generated. However, directly applying the GAN-based models to this task
leads to unsatisfactory results because there is a large variance in the
caricature distribution. Moreover, some models require strictly paired training
data which largely limits their usage scenarios. In this paper, we propose
CariGAN overcome these problems. Instead of training on paired data, CariGAN
learns transformations only from weakly paired images. Specifically, to enforce
reasonable exaggeration and facial deformation, facial landmarks are adopted as
an additional condition to constrain the generated image. Furthermore, an
attention mechanism is introduced to encourage our model to focus on the key
facial parts so that more vivid details in these regions can be generated.
Finally, a Diversity Loss is proposed to encourage the model to produce diverse
results to help alleviate the `mode collapse' problem of the conventional
GAN-based models. Extensive experiments on a new large-scale `WebCaricature'
dataset show that the proposed CariGAN can generate more plausible caricatures
with larger diversity compared with the state-of-the-art models.

a test stage and then deploy the better-performing treatment to the remainder

using hypothesis testing, we re-frame them as an explicit trade-off between the
opportunity cost of the test (where some customers receive a sub-optimal
treatment) and the potential losses associated with deploying a sub-optimal
treatment to the remainder of the population.
  We derive a closed-form expression for the profit-maximizing test size and
show that it is substantially smaller than typically recommended for a
hypothesis test, particularly when the response is noisy or when the total
population is small. The common practice of using small holdout groups can be
rationalized by asymmetric priors. The proposed test design achieves nearly the
same expected regret as the flexible, yet harder-to-implement multi-armed
bandit under a wide range of conditions.
  We demonstrate the benefits of the method in three different marketing
contexts -- website design, display advertising and catalog tests -- in which
we estimate priors from past data. In all three cases, the optimal sample sizes
are substantially smaller than for a traditional hypothesis test, resulting in
higher profit.

methods for solving null control problems for the Stokes system with few
internal scalar controls and Dirichlet or Navier slip boundary conditions. To
the best of our knowledge, it has not been reported in the literature any
numerical approximation through RBFs to solve the direct Stokes problem with
Navier slip boundary conditions. In this paper we fill this gap to show its
application for solving the null control problem for the Stokes system. To
achieve this goal, we introduce two radial basis function solvers, one global
and the other local, to discretized the primal and adjoint systems related to
the control problem. Both techniques are based on divergence free global RBFs.
Stability analysis for these methods is performed in terms of the spectral
radius of the corresponding Gram matrices. By using a conjugate gradient
algorithm, adapted to the radial basis function setting, the control problem is
solved. Several test problems in two dimensions are numerically solved by these
RBFs methods to test their feasibility. The solutions to these problems are
also obtained by finite elements techniques, (FE), to compare their relative
performance.

randomly truncated from an utterance to learn the utterance-level speaker
embedding, while using the average embedding of all segments of a test
utterance to verify the speaker, which results in a critical mismatch between
testing and training. This mismatch degrades the performance of speaker
verification, especially when the durations of training and testing utterances
are very different. To alleviate this issue, we propose the deep segment
attentive embedding method to learn the unified speaker embeddings for
utterances of variable duration. Each utterance is segmented by a sliding
window and LSTM is used to extract the embedding of each segment. Instead of
only using one local segment, we use the whole utterance to learn the
utterance-level embedding by applying an attentive pooling to the embeddings of
all segments. Moreover, the similarity loss of segment-level embeddings is
introduced to guide the segment attention to focus on the segments with more
speaker discriminations, and jointly optimized with the similarity loss of
utterance-level embeddings. Systematic experiments on Tongdun and VoxCeleb show
that the proposed method significantly improves robustness of duration variant

elements (PCN elements) for the extension $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}/\mathbb{F}_q$ for
any $q$ and $n$. It is known that the conjecture holds for $n \leq q$. In this
work we prove the conjecture for a larger range of exponents. In particular, we
give sharper bounds for the number of completely normal elements and use them
to prove asymptotic and effective existence results for $q\leq n\leq
O(q^\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon=2$ for the asymptotic results and
$\epsilon=1.25$ for the effective ones. For $n$ even we need to assume that
$q-1\nmid n$.

demonstrated experimentally. To minimize non-linear effects, an high ratio of
active area to total area is used to avoid large localized amplitudes. The
absorber consists of three elements: a mass supported by a very flexible
membrane, a cavity and a resistive layer. The resonance frequency of the sound
absorber can be easily adjusted just by changing the mass or thickness of the
cavity. A very large ratio between wavelength and material thickness is
measured for a manufactured perfect absorber (ratio = 201) . It is shown that
this high sub-wavelength ratio is associated with narrowband effects and that
the increase in the sub-wavelength ratio is limited by the damping in the

interpretation of radio wave signals produced by cosmic ray interactions with
Earth's atmosphere which are observed by the Antarctica based ANITA detector
after reflection off the ice surface. The incident wave is decomposed into
plane waves and each plane wave is reflected off the surface using the standard
Fresnel formalism. For each plane wave the reflected wave is assumed to be
locally a plane wave. This is a very reasonable assumption and there are no
uncontrolled approximations in our treatment of the reflection phenomenon. The
surface roughness effects are also included by using a simple model. We apply
our formalism to the radiation produced by the balloon-borne HiCal
radio-frequency (RF) transmitter. Our final results for the reflected power are
found to be in good agreement with data for all elevation angles. We also study
the properties of reflected radio pulses in order to study their phase
relationship with direct pulses. We find that for some roughness models the
pulse shape can be somewhat distorted and may be misidentified as a direct
pulse. However this is a rather small effect and is unable to provide an
explanation for the observed mystery events by ANITA.

solving algebraic equations. It is found that essential calculations are

calculated by numerically computing integrals of known functions. For some

of three strongly-lensed systems. One of these, nick-named \emph{The Doughnut},
consists of three complete images of a complex ring galaxy at $z = 0.8718$ and
a fourth, partial and radial image close to the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG)
only discernible thanks to its strong [OII] line emission. The best-fit mass
model (rms of 0.38\arcsec) yields a two-dimensional enclosed mass of $M({\rm R

the intra-cluster gas, we observe an offset between the gas and dark-matter
peaks of ($1.7\pm0.5$)\arcsec, and excellent alignment of the X-ray peak with
the location of optical emission line associated with the BCG. We interpret all
observational evidence in the framework of on-going merger activity, noting
specifically that the coincidence between the gas peak and the peak of blue
light from the BCG may be evidence of dense, cold gas leading to direct star
formation. We use the surface area $\sigma_{\mu}$ above a given magnification

the prior distribution in the probabilistic model. Furthermore, the DGM
generates images from coarse to finer scales. It introduces a small set of
latent variables at each scale, and enforces dependencies among all the latent
variables via a conjugate prior distribution. This conjugate prior yields a new
regularizer based on paths rendered in the generative model for training
CNNs-the Rendering Path Normalization (RPN). We demonstrate that this
regularizer improves generalization, both in theory and in practice. In
addition, likelihood estimation in the DGM yields training losses for CNNs, and
inspired by this, we design a new loss termed as the Max-Min cross entropy
which outperforms the traditional cross-entropy loss for object classification.
The Max-Min cross entropy suggests a new deep network architecture, namely the
Max-Min network, which can learn from less labeled data while maintaining good
prediction performance. Our experiments demonstrate that the DGM with the RPN

our study is the first to adopt CapsNet and NLSTM in the field of traffic
forecasting. An experiment on a Beijing transportation network with 278 links
shows that the proposed framework with the capability of capturing complicated
spatiotemporal traffic patterns outperforms multiple state-of-the-art traffic
forecasting baseline models. The superiority and feasibility of CapsNet and
NLSTM are also demonstrated, respectively, by visualizing and quantitatively
evaluating the experimental results.

guidance for calculating the health insurance premium tax credit created by the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare. We ask the
question of whether there is a procedure, computable by hand, which can
calculate the appropriate premium tax credit for any household with
self-employment income. We give an example showing that IRS tax guidance, which
has had self-employed taxpayers use an iterative fixed point procedure to
calculate their premium tax credits since 2014, can lead to a divergent
sequence of iterates. As a consequence, IRS guidance does not calculate
appropriate premium tax credits for tax returns in certain income intervals,
adversely affecting eligible beneficiaries. A bisection procedure for
calculating premium tax credits is proposed. We prove that this procedure
calculates appropriate premium tax credits for a model of simple tax returns;
and apparently, this procedure has already been used to prepare accepted tax
returns. We outline the problem of finding a procedure which calculates
appropriate premium tax credits for models of general tax returns. While the
bisection procedure will work with the tax code in its current configuration,
it could fail, in states which have not expanded Medicaid, if a certain
deduction were to revert to an earlier form. Future policy objectives might
also lead to further problems.

perpendicularly to the tensile axis, cracks in natural and synthetic composites
deflect from a straight path, often increasing the toughness of the material.
Here we combine experiments and simulations to identify materials properties
that predict whether cracks propagate straight or kink on a macroscale larger
than the composite microstructure. Those properties include the anisotropy of
the fracture energy, which we vary several folds by increasing the volume
fraction of orientationally ordered alumina platelets inside a polymer matrix,
and a microstructure-dependent process zone size that is found to modulate the
additional stabilizing or destabilizing effect of the non-singular stress
acting parallel to the crack. Those properties predict the existence of an
anisotropy threshold for crack kinking and explain the surprisingly strong
dependence of this threshold on sample geometry and load distribution.

on how the existence of multiple misbehaving pools influences the profitability
of selfish mining. Each selfish miner maintains a private chain and makes it
public opportunistically for the purpose of acquiring more rewards
incommensurate to his Hashrate. We establish a novel Markov chain model to
characterize all the state transitions of public and private chains. The
minimum requirement of Hashrate together with the minimum delay of being
profitable is derived in close-form. The former reduces to 21.48% with the
symmetric selfish miners, while their competition with asymmetric Hashrates
puts forward a higher requirement of the profitable threshold. The profitable
delay increases with the decrease of the Hashrate of selfish miners, making the
mining pools more cautious on performing selfish mining.

electric controlled) implementation using transition metal oxides materials,
which exhibit unique properties that emulate key functionalities needed for
this application. In the Introduction, we compare the main differences between
a conventional computational machine, based on the Turing-von Neumann paradigm,
to a Neuromorphic machine, which tries to emulate important functionalities of
a biological brain. We also describe the main electrical properties of
biological systems, which would be useful to implement in a charge-based
system. In Chapter II, we describe the main components of a possible
solid-state implementation. In Chapter III, we describe a variety of Resistive
Switching phenomena, which may serve as the functional basis for the
implementation of key devices for Neuromorphic computing. In Chapter IV we
describe why transition metal oxides, are promising materials for future
Neuromorphic machines. Theoretical models describing different resistive
switching mechanisms are discussed in Chapter V while existing implementations
are described in Chapter VI. Chapter VII presents applications to practical
problems. We list in Chapter VIII important basic research challenges and open
issues. We discuss issues related to specific implementations, novel materials,
devices and phenomena. The development of reliable, fault tolerant, energy
efficient devices, their scaling and integration into a Neuromorphic computer
may bring us closer to the development of a machine that rivals the brain.

  CSI Uncertainty","Accepted by WCSP 2018, Hangzhou, China",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a novel robust beamforming scheme is proposed in three
dimensional multi-input multi-output (3D-MIMO) systems. As one of the typical
deployments of massive MIMO, a 3D-MIMO system owns sparse channels in angular
domain. Thus, various of sparse channel estimation algorithms produce sparse
channel estimation errors which can be utilized to narrow down the perturbation
region of imperfect CSI. We investigate a $l_1$-norm bounded channel
uncertainty model for the robust beamforming problems, which captures the
sparse nature of channel errors. Compared with the conventional spherical
uncertainty, we prove that the scheme with $l_1$-norm bounded uncertainty
consumes less beamforming power with the same signal to interference and noise
ratio (SINR) thresholds. The proposed scheme is reformulated as a second-order
cone programming (SOCP) and simulation results verify the effectiveness of our
algorithm.
