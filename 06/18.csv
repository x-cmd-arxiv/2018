geometric mean is more appropriate than the arithmetic mean. However, the
geometric mean has a serious limitation in comparison with the arithmetic mean.
Means are used to summarize the information in a large set of values in a
single number; yet, the geometric mean of a data set with at least one zero is
always zero. As a result, the geometric mean does not capture any information
about the non-zero values. The purpose of this short contribution is to review
solutions proposed in the literature that enable the computation of the
geometric mean of data sets containing zeros and to show that they do not
fulfil the `recovery' or `monotonicity' conditions that we define. The standard
geometric mean should be recovered from the modified geometric mean if the data
set does not contain any zeros (recovery condition). Also, if the values of an
ordered data set are greater one by one than the values of another data set
then the modified geometric mean of the first data set must be greater than the
modified geometric mean of the second data set (monotonicity condition). We
then formulate a modified version of the geometric mean that can handle zeros
while satisfying both desired conditions.

attracted much attention from the vision community because of their top
performance in both localization accuracy and efficiency. The society of visual
tracking, however, still needs to deal with the following difficulty on CF
trackers: avoiding or eliminating the boundary effect completely, in the
meantime, exploiting non-linear kernels and running efficiently. In this paper,
we propose a fast kernelized correlation filter without boundary effect
(nBEKCF) to solve this problem. To avoid the boundary effect thoroughly, a set
of \emph{real} and \emph{dense} patches is sampled through the traditional
sliding window and used as the training samples to train nBEKCF to fit a
Gaussian response map. Non-linear kernels can be applied naturally in nBEKCF
due to its different theoretical foundation from the existing CF trackers'. To
achieve the fast training and detection, a set of cyclic bases is introduced to
construct the filter. Two algorithms, ACSII and CCIM, are developed to
significantly accelerate the calculation of kernel correlation matrices. ACSII
and CCIM fully exploit the density of training samples and cyclic structure of
bases, and totally run in space domain. The efficiency of CCIM exceeds that of
the FFT counterpart remarkably in our task. Extensive experiments on six public
datasets, OTB-2013, OTB-2015, NfS, VOT2018, GOT10k, and TrackingNet, show that
compared to the CF trackers designed to relax the boundary effect, BACF and
SRDCF, our nBEKCF achieves higher localization accuracy without tricks, in the
meanwhile, runs at higher FPS.

contain a single oscillon that occupies the $\theta$-frequency band and a
couple of $\gamma$-oscillons that correspond, respectively, to slow and fast

provisions to repair such blind spots once identified. For example, the newly

a novel learning based discriminative evaluation metric that is directly

The proposed metric is evaluated with three kinds of robustness tests and its
correlation with human judgments. Extensive experiments show that the proposed

ingredient of next generation (5G) wireless networks. Effective mmWave
communications require fast and reliable methods for beamforming at both the
User Equipment (UE) and the Base Station (BS) sides, in order to achieve a
sufficiently large Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) after beamforming. We refer to
the problem of finding a pair of strongly coupled narrow beams at the
transmitter and receiver as the Beam Alignment (BA) problem. In this paper, we
propose an efficient BA scheme for single-carrier mmWave communications. In the
proposed scheme, the BS periodically probes the channel in the downlink via a
pre-specified pseudo-random beamforming codebook and pseudo-random spreading
codes, letting each UE estimate the Angle-of-Arrival / Angle-of-Departure
(AoA-AoD) pair of the multipath channel for which the energy transfer is
maximum. We leverage the sparse nature of mmWave channels in the AoA-AoD domain
to formulate the BA problem as the estimation of a sparse non-negative vector.
Based on the recently developed Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS) technique, we
efficiently find the strongest AoA-AoD pair connecting each UE to the BS. We
evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme under a realistic channel
model, where the propagation channel consists of a few multipath scattering
components each having different delays, AoAs-AoDs, and Doppler shifts.The
channel model parameters are consistent with experimental channel measurements.
Simulation results indicate that the proposed method is highly robust to fast
channel variations caused by the large Doppler spread between the multipath
components. Furthermore, we also show that after achieving BA the beamformed

outflow is intimately associated with accretion. Free-free (thermal) radio
continuum emission is associated with these jets. This emission is relatively
weak and compact, and sensitive radio interferometers are required to study it.
Observations in the cm range are most useful to trace the base of the ionized
jets, close to the central protostar, where optical or near-IR imaging is made
difficult by the high extinction present. Radio recombination lines in jets (in
combination with proper motions) should provide their 3D kinematics at very
small scale. Future instruments such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and
the Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) will be crucial to perform this
kind of sensitive observations. Thermal jets are associated with both high and
low mass protostars and possibly even with substellar objects. The ionizing
mechanism of these radio jets appears to be related to shocks in the associated
outflows, as suggested by the observed correlation between the cm luminosity
and the outflow momentum rate. Some protostellar jets show indications of
non-thermal emission in their lobes. Linearly polarized synchrotron emission
has been found in the jet of HH 80-81, allowing one to map the jet magnetic
field, a key ingredient to determine the collimation and ejection mechanisms.
As only a fraction of the emission is polarized, very sensitive observations
such as those that will be feasible with the interferometers previously
mentioned are required to perform studies in a large sample of sources. Jets
are present in many kinds of astrophysical scenarios. Characterizing radio jets
in young stars, where thermal emission allows one to determine their physical
conditions, would also be useful in understanding acceleration and collimation
mechanisms in all kinds of astrophysical jets.

one-dimensional confinement: particles in a single file exhibit sub-diffusive
behavior, while liquid confinement causes distance-independent correlations
between the particles. Such interactions in channels are well studied for
passive Brownian motion, but driven transport remains largely unexplored. Here,
we demonstrate gating of transport due to a speed-up effect for actively driven
particle transport through microfluidic channels. We prove that particle
velocity increases with particle density in the channel due to hydrodynamic
interactions under electrophoretic and gravitational forces. Numerical models
demonstrate that the observed speed-up of transport originates from a
hydrodynamic piston-like effect. Our discovery is fundamentally important for
understanding protein channels and transport through porous materials and for
designing novel sensors and filters.

flows. The proposed method relies on physical mechanisms to resolve and smooth
sharp unresolved flow features that may otherwise lead to numerical
instability, such as shock waves and under-resolved thermal and shear layers.
To that end, we devise various sensors to detect when and where the shear
viscosity, bulk viscosity and thermal conductivity of the fluid do not suffice
to stabilize the numerical solution. In such cases, the fluid viscosities are
selectively increased to ensure the cell Peclet number is of order one so that
these flow features can be well represented with the grid resolution. Although
the shock capturing method is devised in the context of discontinuous Galerkin
methods, it can be used with other discretization schemes. The performance of
the method is illustrated through numerical simulation of external and internal
flows in transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic regimes. For the problems
considered, the shock capturing method performs robustly, provides sharp shock
profiles, and has a small impact on the resolved turbulent structures. These
three features are critical to enable robust and accurate large-eddy
simulations of shock flows.

For example, the critical shear is much larger for von Willebrand Factor (vWF)

differently depending on the polymer length and the charge-strength of the CNP.
It is shown that CNP alter the conformational dynamics of polymers under shear

shifts the critical shear rate and alters the scaling. Furthermore, it is shown
that the critical zeta potential of CNP, $\zeta^{*}$, scales linearly with

rank-reduced decomposition outperforms model-based alternatives in human brain

the signal. Furthermore, we validate the potential of joint radial-spherical as
compared to single-shell representations. As such, SHARD is optimally suited
for applications that require low-rank signal predictions, such as motion
correction and outlier rejection. Finally, we illustrate its application for
the latter using outlier robust regression.

surfaces for high-contrast imaging requires a detailed accounting of
diffraction effects. Unlike simple Fraunhofer diffraction modeling, near and
far-field diffraction effects, such as the Talbot effect, are captured by
plane-to-plane propagation using Fresnel and angular spectrum propagation. This
approach requires a sequence of computationally intensive Fourier transforms
and quadratic phase functions, which limit the design and aberration
sensitivity parameter space which can be explored at high-fidelity in the
course of coronagraph design. This study presents the results of optimizing the
multi-surface propagation module of the open source Physical Optics Propagation
in PYthon (POPPY) package. This optimization was performed by implementing and
benchmarking Fourier transforms and array operations on graphics processing
units, as well as optimizing multithreaded numerical calculations using the
NumExpr python library where appropriate, to speed the end-to-end simulation of
observatory and coronagraph optical systems. Using realistic systems, this
study demonstrates a greater than five-fold decrease in wall-clock runtime over
POPPY's previous implementation and describes opportunities for further
improvements in diffraction modeling performance.

Imaging (MRI) provide information describing anatomical structures. Fusing the
complementary information from the two modalities is helpful in oncology. In
this project, we implemented a complete tool allowing semi-automatic MRI-PET
registration for small animal imaging in the preclinical studies. A two-stage
hierarchical registration approach is proposed. First, a global affine
registration is applied. For robust and fast registration, principal component
analysis (PCA) is used to compute the initial parameters for the global affine
registration. Since, only the low intensities in the PET volume reveal the
anatomic information on the MRI scan, we proposed a non-uniform intensity
transformation to the PET volume to enhance the contrast of the low intensity.
This helps to improve the computation of the centroid and principal axis by
increasing the contribution of the low intensities. Then, the globally
registered image is given as input to the second stage which is a local
deformable registration (B-spline registration). Mutual information is used as
metric function for the optimization. A multi-resolution approach is used in
both stages. The registration algorithm is supported by graphical user
interface (GUI) and visualization methods so that the user can interact easily
with the process. The performance of the registration algorithm is validated by
two medical experts on seven different datasets on abdominal and brain areas
including noisy and difficult image volumes.

machineries in nature. A duty ratio $D$ is a fraction of time that the stator
and the rotor interact and is a fundamental property to characterize the motor
but remains to be determined. It is known that the stator units of the motor
bind to and dissociate from the motor dynamically to control the motor torque
depending on the load on the motor. At low load where the kinetics such as a
proton translocation speed limits the rotation rate, the dependency of the
rotation rate on the number of stator units $N$ infers $D$; the dependency
becomes larger for smaller $D$. Contradicting observations supporting both the
small and large $D$ have been reported. A dilemma is that it is difficult to
explore a broad range of $N$ at low load because the stator units easily
dissociate, and $N$ is limited to one or two at vanishing load. Here, we
develop an electrorotation method to dynamically control the load on the
flagellar motor of {\it Salmonella} with a calibrated magnitude of the torque.
By instantly reducing the load for keeping $N$ high, we observed that the speed
at low load depends on $N$, implying a small duty ratio. We recovered the
torque-speed curves of individual motors and evaluated the duty ratio to be
$0.14 \pm 0.04$ from the correlation between the torque at high load and the
rotation rate at low load.

years for these scenarios (2020-2050), when we as a species should run out of
space or food, or induce catastrophic anthropogenic climate change through
thermodynamically unavoidable direct heating of the planet. Now that over four
decades have passed, in this paper we update VH75. We perform similar
calculations as that work, with improved data and trends in population growth,
food production, energy use, and climate change. For many of the impacts noted
in VH75 our work amounts to pushing the ""doomsday"" horizon back to the
2300s-2400s (or much further for population-driven interstellar colonization).
This is largely attributable to using worldwide data that exhibit smaller
growth rates of population and energy use in the last few decades. While
population-related catastrophes appear less likely than in VH75, our continued
growth in energy use provides insight into possible future issues. We find
that, if historic trends continue, direct heating of the Earth will be a
substantial contributor to climate change by about 2260, regardless of the
energy source used, coincident with our transition to a Kardashev type-I
civilization. We also determine that either an increase of Earth's global mean
temperature of 12K will occur or an unreasonably high fraction of the planet
will need to be covered by solar collectors by about 2400 to keep pace with our
growth in energy use. We further discuss the implications in terms of
interstellar expansion, the transition to type II and III civilizations, SETI,

this work, we show that, when considering neutral test particles around a
family of stationary axially-symmetric analytical exact solution to the
Einstein-Maxwell field equations, frame-dragging (as captured through spacetime
vorticity) is capable of reconstructing KAM-tori from initially highly chaotic
configurations. We study this reconstruction by isolating the contribution of
the spacetime vorticity scalar to the dynamics, and exemplify our findings by
computing rotation curves and the dimensionality of phase-space. Since
signatures of chaotic dynamics in gravitational waves have been suggested as a
way to test general relativity in the strong-field regime, we have computed
gravitational waveforms using the semi-relativistic approximation and studied
the frequency content of the gravitational wave spectrum. If this mechanism is
generic, chaos suppression by frame-dragging may undermine present proposals to
verify the hypothesis of the no-hair theorems and the validity of general
relativity.

text. Compared to the temperature of the ambient air, the temperature of the
liquid water could have a much larger effect on the evaporation efficiency. The
effective thermal conductivity of the second layer, which could impose
important effect on the evaporation efficiency, mainly depends on the porosity
rather than the thermal conductivity of the second-layer porous material. Thus,
we do not need to take into consideration of the thermal conductivity when
selecting second-layer materials. This study is expected to provide some
information for designing a high-evaporation-performance bi-layered system.

$\lesssim 0.1$pc as the final stage of galaxy mergers are sources of low
frequency gravitational waves (GW), however, they are still elusive
observationally because they are not spatially resolved. Fortunately,
reverberation as echoes of broad emission lines to ionizing continuum conveys
invaluable information of the dynamics of broad-line regions (BLRs) governed by
supermassive black holes in the central regions of active galactic nuclei
(AGNs). In this paper, we demonstrate how to composite the hybrid 2-dimensional
transfer functions of binary BLRs around the CB-SMBHs in AGNs, providing an
opportunity of identifying them from reverberation mapping (RM) data. It is
found that there are variation-coupling effects in the transfer functions,
arising from the coupling of CB-SMBH light curves in the Fourier space. We
provide semi-analytical formulations of the transfer functions for kinematic
maps of the gas. For cases with the simplest variation-coupling effects, we
make calculations for several BLR models and reveal significant distinctions
from those of single active black holes. In principle, the difference is caused
by the orbital motion of the CB-SMBH systems. In order to search for CB-SMBHs
in time-domain space, selection of target candidates should focus on local AGNs
with H$\beta$ double-peaked profiles and weaker near-infrared emission.
High-fidelity RM-campaigns of monitoring the targets in future will provide
opportunities to reveal these kinematic signatures of the CB-SMBHs and hence
for measurements of their orbital parameters.

code of a power-grid system, especially zero-day attacks, can be catastrophic.
Earlier detection of the anomalies can prevent further damage. However,
detecting zero-day attacks is extremely challenging because they have no known
code and have unknown behavior. Furthermore, if data collected from the
controller is transferred to a server through networks for analysis and
detection of anomalous behavior, this creates a very large attack surface and
also delays detection.

Distribution (RED) of Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs), and a data-driven
defense system based on it. Specifically, we first train a temporal deep
learning model, using only normal HPC readings from legitimate processes that
run daily in these power-grid systems, to model the normal behavior of the
power-grid controller. Then, we run this model using real-time data from
commonly available HPCs. We use the proposed RED to enhance the temporal deep
learning detection of anomalous behavior, by estimating distribution deviations
from the normal behavior with an effective statistical test. Experimental
results on a real power-grid controller show that we can detect anomalous

strategies in the finite horizon case were shown to be characterized by coupled
Riccati recursions. In this paper, we show that if the link failure
probabilities are below certain critical thresholds, then the coupled Riccati

artificial agents, the combined usage of multiple intrinsic drives remains
still a relatively unexplored research area. Specifically, we hypothesize that
a mechanism capable of quantifying and controlling the evolution of the
information flow between the agent and the environment could be the fundamental
component for implementing a higher degree of autonomy into artificial
intelligent agents. This paper propose a unified strategy for implementing two
semantically orthogonal intrinsic motivations: curiosity and empowerment.
Curiosity reward informs the agent about the relevance of a recent agent
action, whereas empowerment is implemented as the opposite information flow
from the agent to the environment that quantifies the agent's potential of
controlling its own future. We show that an additional homeostatic drive is
derived from the curiosity reward, which generalizes and enhances the
information gain of a classical curious/heterostatic reinforcement learning
agent. We show how a shared internal model by curiosity and empowerment
facilitates a more efficient training of the empowerment function. Finally, we
discuss future directions for further leveraging the interplay between these
two intrinsic rewards.

management cannot guarantee end-user quality-of-experience (QoE) for all

quality-of-service (QoS) measurement and efficient network resource allocation.
With the software-defined network technology, the core network may be
controlled more efficiently by a network service provider. However, end-to-end
network QoS can hardly be improved the managing the core network only. In this
paper, we propose an encrypted packet classification scheme for smart home
gateways to improve end-to-end QoS measurement from the network operator side.
Furthermore, other services such as statistical data collecting, billing to
service providers, etc., can be provided without compromising end-user privacy
nor security of a network. The proposed encrypted packet classification scheme
has a two-level hierarchical structure. One is the service level, which is
based on applications that have the same network QoS requirements. A faster
classification scheme based on deep learning is proposed to achieve real-time
classification with high accuracy. The other one is the application level,
which is based on fine-grained applications. A non-real-time classifier can be
applied to provide high accuracy. Evaluation is conducted on both level

sources by long short-term memory (LSTM) models and has recently also been
applied to other models such as the highway network. Although gating is
powerful, it is rather expensive in terms of both computation and storage as
each gating unit uses a separate full weight matrix. This issue can be severe
since several gates can be used together in e.g. an LSTM cell. This paper
proposes a semi-tied unit (STU) approach to solve this efficiency issue, which
uses one shared weight matrix to replace those in all the units in the same
layer. The approach is termed ""semi-tied"" since extra parameters are used to
separately scale each of the shared output values. These extra scaling factors
are associated with the network activation functions and result in the use of
parameterised sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, and rectified linear unit functions.
Speech recognition experiments using British English multi-genre broadcast data
showed that using STUs can reduce the calculation and storage cost by a factor
of three for highway networks and four for LSTMs, while giving similar word
error rates to the original models.

of the reconstructed mean rest-frame SED are similar to those found in other

aforementioned SEDs normalized in the near-UV) and a prominent bump around 4-6
$\mu$m, followed by a decrease out to $\sim 20 \,\mu$m and a subsequent far-IR
bump. From the fitted SEDs we estimate the average active galactic nuclei (AGN)
luminosity $L_{\rm AGN}$ and star formation rate (SFR) as function of cosmic
time, finding typical $L_{\rm AGN} \sim 10^{46} - 10^{47}$ erg/s and SFR $\sim

experienced by customers. In practice, a well-informed Indian citizen can
escape censorship through a judicious choice of service provider. We then
consider the question of whether India might potentially follow the Chinese
model and institute a single, government-controlled filter. This would not be
difficult, as the Indian Internet is quite centralized already. A few ""key""
ASes (approx 1% of Indian ASes) collectively intercept approx 95% of paths to
the censored sites we sample in our study, and also to all publicly-visible DNS

only two private ISPs. If the government is willing to employ more powerful
measures, such as an IP Prefix Hijacking attack, any one of several key ASes
can censor traffic for nearly all Indian users. Finally, we demonstrate that
such federated censorship by India would cause substantial collateral damage to
non-Indian ASes whose traffic passes through Indian cyberspace (which do not

limited range. Consider for instance the class of spectral mean statistics
(also called integrated periodograms) which includes many important statistics
in time series analysis, such as sample autocovariances and autocorrelations
among other things. Essentially, such frequency domain bootstrap procedures
cover the case of linear time series with independent innovations, and some
even require the time series to be Gaussian. In this paper we propose a new,
frequency domain bootstrap method which is consistent for a much wider range of
stationary processes and can be applied to a large class of periodogram-based
statistics. It introduces a new concept of convolved periodograms of smaller
samples which uses pseudo periodograms of subsamples generated in a way that
correctly imitates the weak dependence structure of the periodogram. %The new
bootstrap procedure %corrects for those aspects of the distribution of spectral
means that cannot be mimicked by existing procedures. We show consistency for
this procedure for a general class of stationary time series, ranging clearly
beyond linear processes, and for general spectral means and ratio statistics.
Furthermore, and for the class of spectral means, we also show, how, using this
new approach, existing bootstrap methods, which replicate appropriately only
the dominant part of the distribution of interest, can be corrected. The finite
sample performance of the new bootstrap procedure is illustrated via
simulations.

B-mode of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is primarily limited by our
knowledge of the polarized microwave foreground emissions. Thus improvements of
the foreground analysis are necessary. As revealed
in~\cite{2018arXiv180410382L}, the E-mode and B-mode of the polarized
foreground have noticeable different properties, both in morphology and
frequency spectrum, suggesting that they arise from different physical
processes, and need to be studied separately.
  Aims: I will study the polarized emission from Galactic loops, especially
Loop I, and mainly focus on the following issues: Does it contribute
predominantly to the E-mode or B-mode? In which frequency bands and in which
sky regions can it be identified?
  Methods: Based on a well known result about the magnetic field alignment in
supernova explosions, a theoretical expectation is established that the loop
polarizations should be predominantly E-mode. In particular, the expected
polarization angles of Loop I are compared with those from the real microwave
band data of WMAP and Planck.
  Results and conclusions: The comparison between model and data shows
remarkable consistency between data and expectation at all bands and for a
large area of the sky. This result suggests that the polarized emission of
Galactic Loop I is a major polarized component in all microwave bands from 23
to 353 GHz, and a considerable part of the polarized foreground is likely
originated from a local bubble associated with Loop I, instead of the far more
distant Galactic emission. The result also provides a possible way to explain
the reported E-to-B excess~\citep{2016A&A...586A.133P} by contribution of the
loops. Finally, this work may also provide the first geometrical evidence that
the Earth was hit by a supernova explosion.

accuracy. To cope with the massive amount of computation needed for such
complex CNNs, the latest solutions utilize blocking of an image over the
available dimensions and batching of multiple input images to improve data
reuse in the memory hierarchy. While there has been numerous works on
maximizing data reuse, only a few studies have focused on the memory bottleneck
caused by limited bandwidth. Bandwidth bottleneck can easily occur in CNN
acceleration as CNN layers have different sizes with varying computation needs
and as batching is typically performed over each CNN layer for an ideal data
reuse. In this case, the data transfer demand for a layer can be relatively low
or high compared to the computation requirement of the layer, and hence
temporal fluctuations in memory access can be induced eventually causing
bandwidth problems. In this paper, we first show that there exists a high
degree of fluctuation in memory access to computation ratio depending on CNN
layers and functions in the layer being processed by the compute units (cores),
where the units are tightly synchronized to maximize data reuse. Then we
propose a strategy of partitioning the compute units where the cores within
each partition process a batch of input data synchronously to maximize data
reuse but different partitions run asynchronously. As the partitions stay
asynchronous and typically process different CNN layers at any given moment,
the memory access traffic sizes of the partitions become statistically
shuffled. Thus, the partitioning of compute units and asynchronous use of them
make the total memory access traffic size be smoothened over time. We call this
smoothing statistical memory traffic shaping, and we show that it can lead to
8.0 percent of performance gain on a commercial 64-core processor when running
ResNet-50.

two polarized dipoles. It is found that a linear transition dipole can couple
to a left circularly polarized transition dipole much stronger than to a right
circularly polarized transition dipole. This polarization selectivity exists
over a wide frequency range and is robust against the variation of the dipoles'
position or the radius of the ANS. In contrast, a right circularly polarized
transition dipole, can change sharply from coupling strongly to another right
circularly polarized dipole to coupling strongly to a left circularly polarized

calculations for $N>Z$ nuclei with the valence nucleons moving above the cores

interactions, one state-independent and the other of zero range, which are
supposed to scatter pairs in time-revered orbits. It is proven that the ground

can avoid big matrix inverses, which is the main bottleneck in applying basis
function-based algorithms to OR tasks on large-scale datasets. We show that
ISBOR can make accurate predictions with parsimonious basis functions while
offering automatic estimates of the prediction uncertainty. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real word datasets demonstrate the efficiency and
effectiveness of ISBOR compared to other basis function-based OR approaches.

finite number of subsets, then divide each subset into finite pieces and repeat
this process again and again. In this paper we generalize such successive
divisions and call them partitions. Given a partition, we consider the notion
of a weight function assigning a ""size"" to each piece of the partition.
Intuitively we believe that a partition and a weight function should provide a
""geometry"" and an ""analysis"" on the space of our interest. We are going to
pursue this idea in three parts. In the first part, the metrizability of a
weight function, i.e. the existence of a metric ""adapted to"" a given weight
function, is shown to be equivalent to the Gromov hyperbolicity of the graph
associated with the weight function. In the second part, the notions like
bi-Lipschitz equivalence, Ahlfors regularity, the volume doubling property and
quasisymmetry will be shown to be equivalent to certain properties of weight
functions. In particular, we find that quasisymmetry and the volume doubling
property are the same notion in the world of weight functions. In the third

Starting with an extended Hubbard model, with parameters which yield a CDW
ground state within Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov formalism in pure systems, we show
that the addition of disorder quickly wipes out the global charge order by
disrupting periodic modulation of density at some (low) strength of disorder.
Along with this, the subdominant superconducting order emerges in regions that
spatially anti-correlates with islands of strong local CDW order. The
short-range density modulations, however, continue to persist and show
discernible effects up to a larger disorder strength. The local CDW puddles
reduce in size with increasing disorder and they finally lose their relevance
in effecting the properties of the system. Our results have strong implications

four analytically solvable and other numerically solved models, we conjecture
that a parametrically fixed CPTSSP has at most one SS. When $V_1$ is fixed and
$V_2$ is varied there may exist Kato's exceptional point(s) $(V_{EP})$ and
critical values $V_{*m}, m=0,1,2,..$, so when $V_2$ crosses one of these
special values a new CCPE is created. When $V_2$ equals a critical value
$V_{*m}$ there exist one SS at $E=E_*$ along with $m$ or more number of CCPEs.
Hence, this single positive energy $E_*$ is the upper (or rough upper) bound to
the CCPEs: ${\cal E}_l \lessapprox E_*$, here ${\cal E}_l$ corresponds to the
last of CCPEs. If $V(x)$ has Kato's exceptional points (EPs:
$V_{EP1}<V_{EP2}<V_{EP3}<...<V_{EPl}$), the smallest of critical values
$V_{*m}$ is always larger than $V_{EPl}$. Hence, in a CPTSSP, real discrete

proportions are obtained by a stick-breaking construction. The inference of
iTM-VAE is modeled by neural networks such that it can be computed in a simple
feed-forward manner. We also describe how to introduce a hyper-prior into
iTM-VAE so as to model the uncertainty of the prior parameter. Actually, the
hyper-prior technique is quite general and we show that it can be applied to
other AEVB based models to alleviate the {\it collapse-to-prior} problem
elegantly. Moreover, we also propose HiTM-VAE, where the document-specific
topic distributions are generated in a hierarchical manner. HiTM-VAE is even
more flexible and can generate topic distributions with better variability.
Experimental results on 20News and Reuters RCV1-V2 datasets show that the

layer graphene field-effect transistors. Noise measurements have been conducted
with electrolyte-gated graphene transistors covering a wide range of gate and
drain bias conditions for different channel lengths. A new analytical model
that accounts for the propagation of the local noise sources in the channel to
the terminal currents and voltages is proposed in this paper to investigate the
noise bias dependence. Carrier number and mobility fluctuations are considered
as the main causes of low frequency noise and the way these mechanisms
contribute to the bias dependence of the noise is analyzed in this work.
Typically, normalized low frequency noise in graphene devices has been usually
shown to follow an M-shape dependence versus gate voltage with the minimum near
the charge neutrality point (CNP). Our work reveals for the first time the
strong correlation between this gate dependence and the residual charge which
is relevant in the vicinity of this specific bias point. We discuss how charge
inhomogeneity in the graphene channel at higher drain voltages can contribute
to low frequency noise; thus, channel regions nearby the source and drain
terminals are found to dominate the total noise for gate biases close to the
CNP. The excellent agreement between the experimental data and the predictions
of the analytical model at all bias conditions confirms that the two
fundamental 1/f noise mechanisms, carrier number and mobility fluctuations,
must be considered simultaneously to properly understand the low frequency
noise in graphene FETs. The proposed analytical compact model can be easily
implemented and integrated in circuit simulators, which can be of high
importance for graphene based circuits design.

stronger in bluer bands than redder bands. The vast majority of clearly

on the interplay between two physical mechanisms, peculiar to open quantum
systems that act in concert: PT-symmetry breaking corresponding to coalescence
of resonances at the exceptional point of the molecule, connected to the leads,
and Fano-Feshbach antiresonance. This switching mechanism can be realized in
particular in a special class of molecules with degenerate energy levels, i.e.
diradicals, which possess mirror symmetry. At zero gate voltage infinitesimally
small interaction of the molecule with the leads breaks the PT-symmetry of the
system that, however, can be restored by application of the gate voltage
preserving the mirror symmetry. PT-symmetry broken state at zero gate voltage
with minimal transmission corresponds to the 'off' state while the PT-symmetric
state at non-zero gate voltage with maximum transmission - to the 'on' state.
At zero gate voltage energy of the antiresonance coincides with exceptional
point but the transmission variation mainly takes place due to the coalescence
of resonances at the exceptional point. We construct a model of an
all-electrical molecular switch based on such transistors acting as a
conventional CMOS inverter and show that essentially lower power consumption
and switching energy can be achieved, compared to the CMOS analogues.

orbital stability in the presence of stellar tides, and the hJ occurrence rate

planet from the stellar dynamical tide and from the protoplanetary disk in the
type II migration regime. We model a 2D nonisothermal viscous disk
parameterized to reproduce the minimum-mass solar nebula and simulate an inner
disk cavity at various radial positions near the star. We choose stellar
rotation periods according to observations of young star clusters. The planet
is on a circular orbit in the disk midplane and in the star's equatorial plane.
We show that the torques can add up to zero beyond the corotation radius around
young stars and stop inward migration. Monte Carlo simulations predict hot
Jupiter survival rates between ~3% (alpha disk viscosity of 1e-1) and 15%
(alpha = 1e-3). Once the protoplanetary disk has been fully accreted, the
surviving hJs are pushed outward from their tidal migration barrier and pile up
near 0.05 AU, as we demonstrate using a numerical implementation of a stellar
dynamical tide model. Orbital decay is negligible on a one-billion-year
timescale due to the contraction of the highly dissipative convective envelopes

metal-rich stars can at least partly explain the observed positive correlation
between stellar metallicity and hJ occurrence. Combined with the observed hJ
occurrence rate, our results for the survival rate imply that <8 % (alpha =
1e-3) to <43 % (alpha = 1e-1) of sun-like stars initially encounter an inward
migrating hJ. This reconciles models and observations of young spinning stars
with the observed hJ pile up and hJ occurrence rates.

Such PDEs arise by linearizing the Degasperis-Procesi (DP) equation at a small
amplitude quasi-periodic function. Our work provides a first fundamental step
in developing a KAM theory for perturbations of the DP equation on the circle.
Following \cite{Airy}, our approach is based on two main points: first a
reduction in orders based on an Egorov type theorem then a KAM diagonalization
scheme. In both steps the key difficulites arise from the asymptotically linear
dispersion law. In view of the application to the nonlinear context we prove
sharp \emph{tame} bounds on the diagonalizing change of variables.
  We remark that the strategy and the techniques proposed are applicable for
proving reducibility of more general classes of linear pseudo differential

LOFAR, show that we are in an era of data-intensive scientific discovery. Such
instruments rely critically on significant computing resources, both hardware
and software, to do science. Considering limited science budgets, and the small
fraction of these that can be dedicated to compute hardware and software, there
is a strong and obvious desire for low-cost computing. However, optimising for
cost is only part of the equation; the value potential over the lifetime of the
solution should also be taken into account. Using a tangible example, compute
hardware, we introduce a conceptual model to approximate the lifetime relative
science value of such a system. While the introduced model is not intended to
result in a numeric value for merit, it does enumerate some components that
define this metric. The intent of this paper is to show how compute system
related design and procurement decisions in data-intensive science projects
should be weighed and valued. By using both total cost and science value as a
driver, the science output per invested Euro is maximised. With a number of
case studies, focused on computing applications in radio astronomy past,
present and future, we show that the hardware-based analysis can be, and has
been, applied more broadly.

lower than the current best one obtained from another machine learning

photometric redshift. The PDFs are shown to have very good predictive power. We
also find that the CNN redshifts are unbiased with respect to galaxy

limit for dynamo action within the outer core is one of negligibly small
inertia and viscosity in the magnetohydrodynamic equations. Within this limit,
he showed the existence of a necessary condition, now well known as Taylor's
constraint, which requires that the cylindrically-averaged Lorentz torque must
everywhere vanish; magnetic fields that satisfy this condition are termed
Taylor states. Taylor further showed that the requirement of this constraint
being continuously satisfied through time prescribes the evolution of the
geostrophic flow, the cylindrically-averaged azimuthal flow. We show that
Taylor's original prescription for the geostrophic flow, as satisfying a given
second order ordinary differential equation, is only valid for a small subset
of Taylor states. An incomplete treatment of the boundary conditions renders
his equation generally incorrect. Here, by taking proper account of the
boundaries, we describe a generalisation of Taylor's method that enables
correct evaluation of the instantaneous geostrophic flow for any 3D Taylor
state. We present the first full-sphere examples of geostrophic flows driven by
non-axisymmetric Taylor states. Although in axisymmetry the geostrophic flow
admits a mild logarithmic singularity on the rotation axis, in the fully 3D
case we show that this is absent and indeed the geostrophic flow appears to be
everywhere regular.

robust confidence region for the three-dimensional parameter vector of a toy
model of the phase-space distribution function of a dSph. Although the
dynamical model presented in this paper is low-dimensional and static, we
emphasize that the algorithm is applicable to any scheme that involves the

to render tractable previously intractable problems, for example, the modelling
of individual dSphs using high-dimensional, time-dependent N-body simulations.

in several optical/IR color-color diagrams, assuming suitable theoretical
models. Since this diagnostic is sensitive to stellar gravity, the procedure
allows us to identify pre-main sequence stars. We find a large population of
YSOs showing signatures of circumstellar disks with or without accretion. In
addition, with the new technique of M-type star selection, we find a rich
population of young M stars with a spatial distribution strongly correlated to
the more massive population. We find evidence of three young clusters, with
different morphology. In addition, we identify field stars falling in the same

tandem playing a min-max game to learn a target underlying data distribution;
when fed with data-points sampled from a simpler distribution (like uniform or
Gaussian distribution). Once trained, they allow synthetic generation of
examples sampled from the target distribution. We investigate the application
of GANs to generate synthetic feature vectors used for speech emotion
recognition. Specifically, we investigate two set ups: (i) a vanilla GAN that
learns the distribution of a lower dimensional representation of the actual
higher dimensional feature vector and, (ii) a conditional GAN that learns the
distribution of the higher dimensional feature vectors conditioned on the
labels or the emotional class to which it belongs. As a potential practical
application of these synthetically generated samples, we measure any

cumulative number of unique replicating entities that appeared in evolution
increased almost linearly along time without an apparent bound, demonstrating
the effectiveness of the proposed cardinality leap. It was also observed that
the number of individual entities involved in a single replication event
gradually increased over time, indicating evolutionary appearance of
higher-order entities. Moreover, these behaviors were not observed in control
experiments in which fitness evaluators were replaced by random number
generators. This strongly suggests that the dynamics observed in Hash Chemistry
were indeed evolutionary behaviors driven by selection and adaptation taking
place at multiple scales.

scales and multiple angles by applying the curvelet transform. Furthermore, the
distance bin is introduced by dividing each row of the matrix into several bins
along the propagating distance to select features. The radar signal dataset in
three dense scenarios is constructed, including people randomly walking in the
constrained area with densities of 3 and 4 persons per square meter, and
queueing with an average distance of 10 centimeters. The number of people is up
to 20 in the dataset. Four classifiers including decision tree, AdaBoost,
random forest and neural network are compared to validate the hybrid features,
and random forest performs the highest accuracies of all above 97% in three
dense scenarios. Moreover, to ensure the reliability of the hybrid features,
three other features including cluster features, activity features and CNN
features are compared. The experimental results reveal that the proposed hybrid

(RHT) to identify and characterize the orientation of the straight

Results. The majority of the straight depolarization canals and the Hi
filaments are inclined by 10deg with respect to the Galactic plane and are
aligned with the plane-of-sky magnetic field orientation probed by the Planck
dust polarization data. The other distinct orientation, of 65deg with respect
to the Galactic plane, is associated with the orientation of a bar-like

between three distinct tracers of the (local) interstellar medium (ISM)

different ISM phases. The majority of the straight depolarization canals are a
result of a projection of the complicated 3D distribution of the ISM. The RHT

the dynamic interactions between the two. A stem cell theory of cancer has
recently been developed that suggests the existence of a subpopulation of
self-renewing tumor cells which is responsible for tumorigenesis, and is able
to initiate metastatic spreading. The question of abundance of the cancer stem

unsolved problem and has been a subject of recent debates. In this paper, we
propose a novel model beyond the standard stochastic models of tumor
development, in order to explore the effect of the density of the CSCs and
oxygen on the tumor's invasive behavior. The model identifies natural selection
as the underlying process for complex morphology of tumors, which has been

challenge to enable widespread sustainable power generation has become making
renewables dispatchable. Low cost energy storage can provide this
dispatchability, but there is no clear technology that can meet the need.
Pumped hydroelectric and compressed air storage have low costs, but they are
geographically constrained. Similarly, lithium-ion batteries are becoming
ubiquitous, but even their lower bounding asymptote cost is too high to enable
cost-competitive dispatchable renewables. Here, we introduce a concept based on
thermal energy grid storage (TEGS) using a multijunction photovoltaic heat
engine (MPV) with promising initial experimental results that could meet the
low cost required to enable cost competitive dispatchable renewables. The
approach exploits an important tradeoff between the accession of an extremely
low cost per unit energy stored, by storing heat instead of electricity
directly, while paying the penalty of a lower round trip efficiency. To
understand why this tradeoff is advantageous, we first introduce a framework
for evaluating storage technologies that treats round trip efficiency (RTE) as
a variable, in addition to cost per unit energy stored (CPE) and cost per unit
power (CPP). It is from this perspective that the TEGS-MPV concept offers a
compelling economic proposition.

Development of automated systems for classifying printed documents based on
their source printer, using image processing techniques, is gaining a lot of
attention in multimedia forensics. Currently, state-of-the-art systems require
that the font of letters present in test documents of unknown origin must be
available in those used for training the classifier. In this work, we attempt
to take the first step towards overcoming this limitation. Specifically, we
introduce a novel printer specific local texture descriptor. The highlight of
our technique is the use of encoding and regrouping strategy based on small
linear-shaped structures composed of pixels having similar intensity and
gradient. The results of experiments performed on two separate datasets show
that: 1) on a publicly available dataset, the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art algorithms for characters printed in the same font, and 2) on
another dataset\footnote{Code and dataset will be made publicly available with
published version of this paper.} having documents printed in four different
fonts, the proposed method correctly classifies all test samples when
sufficient training data is available in same font setup. In addition, it
outperforms state-of-the-art methods for cross font experiments. Moreover, it
reduces the confusion between the printers of same brand and model.

class of complex networks resulting from spread of epidemic diseases via

epidemic control synchronization models with inhibition of contact behavior is
constructed, combining with the epidemic transmission system and the complex
dynamical network carrying extra controllers. By the properties of convex
functions and Gerschgorin theorem, the epidemic threshold of the model is
obtained, and the global stability of disease-free equilibrium is analyzed. For
individual's infected situation, when epidemic spreads, two types of feedback
control strategies depended on the diseases' information are designed: the one
only adds controllers to infected individuals, the other adds controllers both
to infected and susceptible ones. And by using Lyapunov stability theory, under
designed controllers, some criteria that guarantee epidemic control
synchronization system achieving behavior synchronization are also derived.
Several numerical simulations are performed to show the effectiveness of our
theoretical results. As far as we know, this is the first work to address the
controlling behavioral synchronization induced by epidemic spreading under the
pinning feedback mechanism. It is hopeful that we may have more deeper insight
into the essence between disease's spreading and collective behavior

solution of nonideal transverse magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), presented in one of
our recent works, we replace the previously considered Maxwell theory with the
${\cal{CP}}$ violating Maxwell-Chern-Simons (MCS) theory. In this way,
dissipationless chiral magnetic (CM) and anomalous Hall (AH) currents appear in
the MCS equation of motion, that, together with equations of relativistic
hydrodynamics, builds the set of constitutive equations of the nonideal
transverse Chern-Simons magnetohydrodynamics (CSMHD). We are, in particular,
interested in the effect of these currents on the evolution of electromagnetic
fields in a uniformly and longitudinally expanding quark-gluon plasma with
chirality imbalance. Combining the constitutive equations of CSMHD under these
assumptions, we arrive, as expected, at two distinct rotating and nonrotating
solutions for electromagnetic fields. The rotation occurs with increasing
rapidity and a constant angular velocity $\omega_{0}$. Remarkably, the relative
angle between the electric and magnetic fields, $\delta$, turns out to be given
by the coefficient of AH current $\kappa_{E}$ and the electric conductivity of
the medium $\sigma$, as $\delta=\tan^{-1}(\kappa_{E}/\sigma)$. Whereas the
nonrotating solution implies the AH coefficient to be vanishing, and thus
nonrotating electric and magnetic fields to be either parallel or antiparallel,
the relative orientation of rotating electric and magnetic fields and the
evolution of the CM conductivity $\kappa_{B}$ are strongly affected by
nonvanishing $\kappa_{E}$. We explore the effect of positive and negative
$\omega_{0}$ on the evolution of the CM current, and show, in particular, that
a rotation of electromagnetic fields with negative $\omega_{0}$ implies a sign
flip of the CM current in a chiral fluid with nonvanishing AH current.

nuclei (AGNs) has been suggested to be able to produce fast outflows of atomic
hydrogen (HI) gas that can be studied in absorption at high spatial resolution.
We have used the Very Large Array (VLA) and a global
very-long-baseline-interferometry (VLBI) array to locate and study in detail
the HI outflow discovered with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT)
in the re-started radio galaxy 3C 236. We confirm, from the VLA data, the
presence of a blue-shifted wing of the HI with a width of
$\sim1000\mathrm{\,km\,s^{-1}}$. This HI outflow is partially recovered by the
VLBI observation. In particular, we detect four clouds with masses of
$0.28\text{-}1.5\times 10^4M_\odot$ with VLBI that do not follow the regular
rotation of most of the HI. Three of these clouds are located, in projection,
against the nuclear region on scales of $\lesssim 40\mathrm{\,pc}$, while the
fourth is co-spatial to the south-east lobe at a projected distance of
$\sim270\mathrm{\,pc}$. Their velocities are between $150$ and
$640\mathrm{\,km\,s^{-1}}$ blue-shifted with respect to the velocity of the
disk-related HI. These findings suggest that the outflow is at least partly
formed by clouds, as predicted by some numerical simulations and originates
already in the inner (few tens of pc) region of the radio galaxy. Our results
indicate that all of the outflow could consist of many clouds with perhaps
comparable properties as the ones detected, distributed also at larger radii
from the nucleus where the lower brightness of the lobe does not allow us to
detect them. However, we cannot rule out the presence of a diffuse component of
the outflow. The fact that 3C 236 is a low excitation radio galaxy, makes it
less likely that the optical AGN is able to produce strong radiative winds
leaving the radio jet as the main driver for the HI outflow.

optimization algorithms through the lens of nonlinear contraction theory. It
demonstrates that in the case of a time-invariant objective, most elementary
results on gradient descent based on convexity can be replaced by much more
general results based on contraction. In particular, gradient descent converges
to a unique equilibrium if its dynamics are contracting in any metric, with
convexity of the cost corresponding to the special case of contraction in the
identity metric. More broadly, contraction analysis provides new insights for
the case of geodesically-convex optimization, wherein non-convex problems in
Euclidean space can be transformed to convex ones posed over a Riemannian
manifold. In this case, natural gradient descent converges to a unique
equilibrium if it is contracting in any metric, with geodesic convexity of the
cost corresponding to contraction in the natural metric. New results using
semi-contraction provide additional insights into the topology of the set of
optimizers in the case when multiple optima exist. Furthermore, they show how
semi-contraction may be combined with specific additional information to reach
broad conclusions about a dynamical system. The contraction perspective also
easily extends to time-varying optimization settings and allows one to
recursively build large optimization structures out of simpler elements.
Extensions to natural primal-dual optimization and game-theoretic contexts
further illustrate the potential reach of these new perspectives.

  Recommendation",,,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is of great value for both
location-based service providers and users. Recently Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs) have been proved to be effective on sequential recommendation tasks.
However, existing RNN solutions rarely consider the spatio-temporal intervals
between neighbor check-ins, which are essential for modeling user check-in
behaviors in next POI recommendation. In this paper, we propose a new variant
of LSTM, named STLSTM, which implements time gates and distance gates into LSTM
to capture the spatio-temporal relation between successive check-ins.
Specifically, one-time gate and one distance gate are designed to control
short-term interest update, and another time gate and distance gate are
designed to control long-term interest update. Furthermore, to reduce the
number of parameters and improve efficiency, we further integrate coupled input
and forget gates with our proposed model. Finally, we evaluate the proposed
model using four real-world datasets from various location-based social
networks. Our experimental results show that our model significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for next POI recommendation.

promising to tackle many open problems in solar physics. Observations from
other ground and space-based telescopes will greatly benefit from coordinated
endeavors with ALMA, yet the diagnostic potential of combined optical,

we investigate whether mm-wavelengths could aid current inversion schemes to
retrieve a more accurate representation of the temperature structure of the
solar atmosphere. We performed several non-LTE inversion experiments of the
emergent spectra from a snapshot of 3D radiation-MHD simulation. We included
common line diagnostics such as CaII H, K, 8542 \AA$\,$ and MgII h and k,
taking into account partial frequency redistribution effects, along with the
continuum around 1.2 mm and 3 mm. We found that including the mm-continuum in
inversions allows a more accurate inference of temperature as function of
optical depth. The addition of ALMA bands to other diagnostics should improve
the accuracy of the inferred chromospheric temperatures between $\log
\tau\sim[-6,-4.5]$ where the CaII and MgII lines are weakly coupled to the
local conditions. However, we found that simultaneous multi-atom, non-LTE
inversions of optical and UV lines present equally strong constraints in the
lower chromosphere and thus are not greatly improved by the 1.2 mm band.
Nonetheless, the 3 mm band is still needed to better constrain the mid-upper
chromosphere.

exhibit different behavior, e.g., a soft emission component that either
precedes or follows the main prompt emission or that the intensity of the two
emission episodes are comparable with each other. No statistically significant
correlation in the duration of the two emission episodes can be claimed. We
define a new parameter $\varepsilon$ as the ratio of the peak flux of the first

to a larger fluence. The preferred spectral model in our analysis is a cutoff
power-law model for most GRBs. The distribution of $E_p$ for episodes I and II
range from tens of keV to 1000 keV with a lognormal fit and there are no
significant differences between them. Moreover, we do not find significant

object placement over Monte Carlo image synthesis to non-photorealistic
depiction. Their properties such as discrepancy, spectra, anisotropy, or
progressiveness have been analyzed extensively. However, designing methods to
produce sampling patterns with certain properties can require substantial
hand-crafting effort, both in coding, mathematical derivation and compute time.
In particular, there is no systematic way to derive the best sampling algorithm
for a specific end-task.
  Tackling this issue, we suggest another level of abstraction: a toolkit to
end-to-end optimize over all sampling methods to find the one producing
user-prescribed properties such as discrepancy or a spectrum that best fit the
end-task. A user simply implements the forward losses and the sampling method
is found automatically -- without coding or mathematical derivation -- by
making use of back-propagation abilities of modern deep learning frameworks.
While this optimization takes long, at deployment time the sampling method is
quick to execute as iterated unstructured non-linear filtering using radial
basis functions (RBFs) to represent high-dimensional kernels. Several important
previous methods are special cases of this approach, which we compare to
previous work and demonstrate its usefulness in several typical Computer
Graphics applications. Finally, we propose sampling patterns with properties
not shown before, such as high-dimensional blue noise with projective

methods to determine feature robustness based on image perturbations.
Test-retest and perturbation robustness were compared for 4032 features that

A perturbation chain consisting of noise addition, affine translation, volume

macro-scale, continuum. The discrete approach, using agent-based models (ABMs),
is typically stochastic and accounts for properties at the cell-scale.
Conversely, the continuum approach, in which cell density is often modelled as
a system of deterministic partial differential equations (PDEs), provides a
global description of the migration at the population level. Deterministic
models have the advantage that they are generally more amenable to mathematical
analysis. They can lead to significant insights for situations in which the
system comprises a large number of cells, at which point simulating a
stochastic ABM becomes computationally expensive. However, finding an
appropriate continuum model to describe the collective behaviour of a system of
individual cells can be a difficult task. Deterministic models are often
specified on a phenomenological basis, which reduces their predictive power.
Stochastic ABMs have advantages over their deterministic continuum
counterparts. In particular, ABMs can represent individual-level behaviours
(such as cell proliferation and cell-cell interaction) appropriately and are
amenable to direct parameterisation using experimental data. It is essential,
therefore, to establish direct connections between stochastic micro-scale
behaviours and deterministic macro-scale dynamics. In this Chapter we describe
how, in some situations, these two distinct modelling approaches can be unified
into a discrete-continuum equivalence framework. We provide an overview of some
of the more recent advances in this field and we point out some of the relevant
questions that remain unanswered.

ranks, with rank ties broken in favor of smaller keys. Zip trees are
essentially treaps (Seidel and Aragon 1996), except that ranks are drawn from a
geometric distribution instead of a uniform distribution, and we allow rank
ties. These changes enable us to use fewer random bits per node. We perform
insertions and deletions by unmerging and merging paths (""unzipping"" and
""zipping"") rather than by doing rotations, which avoids some pointer changes
and improves efficiency. The methods of zipping and unzipping take inspiration
from previous top-down approaches to insertion and deletion (Stephenson 1980;
Mart\'inez and Roura 1998; Sprugnoli 1980). From a theoretical standpoint, this
work provides two main results. First, zip trees require only $O(\log \log n)$
bits (with high probability) to represent the largest rank in an $n$-node
binary search tree; previous data structures require $O(\log n)$ bits for the
largest rank. Second, zip trees are naturally isomorphic to skip lists (Pugh

After performing a simulation study to show the benefits of the Bayesian

However, the Bayesian hierarchical model corrects the cluster-specific analysis
by bor- rowing strength from other clusters, thus generating more reliable
estimates of IFMR parameters. The data analysis presents the benefits of
Bayesian hierarchical modelling over conventional cluster-specific methods,
which motivates us to elaborate the pow- erful statistical techniques in this

explain the changes which occur in the quasi-intensity/quasi-power, phase shift

during collision. In contrast to this, in the other shape changing collision,
the total energy of soliton in the two modes is conserved during collision. In

explain observed pulsation frequencies and to extend the pulsation instability
region for B-type main-sequence variable stars. For these stars, the pulsations
are driven in the region of the opacity bump of Fe-group elements at
$\sim$200,000 K in the stellar envelope. Here we explore effects of opacity
enhancements for the somewhat cooler main-sequence A-type stars, in which
$p$-mode pulsations are driven instead in the second helium ionization region
at $\sim$50,000 K. We compare models using the new LANL OPLIB vs. LLNL OPAL
opacities for the AGSS09 solar mixture. For models of 2 solar masses and
effective temperature 7600 K, opacity enhancements have only a mild effect on
pulsations, shifting mode frequencies and/or slightly changing kinetic-energy
growth rates. Increased opacity near the bump at 200,000 K can induce
convection that may alter composition gradients created by diffusive settling
and radiative levitation. Opacity increases around the hydrogen and 1st He
ionization region (13,000 K) can cause additional higher-frequency $p$ modes to
be excited, raising the possibility that improved treatment of these layers may
result in prediction of new modes that could be tested by observations. New or
wider convective zones and higher convective velocities produced by opacity
increases could also affect angular momentum transport during evolution. More

  Application to Medical Supply Chains",,"Management Science (2018)",,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a new class of adaptive policies called periodic-affine
policies, that allows a decision maker to optimally manage and control
large-scale newsvendor networks in the presence of uncertain demand without
distributional assumptions. These policies are data-driven and model many
features of the demand such as correlation, and remain robust to parameter
mis-specification. We present a model that can be generalized to multi-product
settings and extended to multi-period problems. This is accomplished by
modeling the uncertain demand via sets. In this way, it offers a natural
framework to study competing policies such as base-stock, affine, and
approximative approaches with respect to their profit, sensitivity to
parameters and assumptions, and computational scalability. We show that the
periodic-affine policies are sustainable, i.e. time consistent, because they
warrant optimality both within subperiods and over the entire planning horizon.
This approach is tractable and free of distributional assumptions, and hence,
suited for real-world applications. We provide efficient algorithms to obtain
the optimal periodic-affine policies and demonstrate their advantages on the
sales data from one of India's largest pharmacy retailers.

that is perpendicular to both the heat flow and the magnetization. This is the

of the magnetization for a long time. However, more generally, the ANE has been
predicted to originate from a net Berry curvature of all bands near the Fermi
level. Subsequently, a large anomalous Nernst thermopower has recently been
observed in topological materials with no net magnetization but large net Berry
curvature around E$_F$. These experiments clearly fall outside the scope of the
conventional magnetization-model of the ANE, but a significant question
remains: Can the value of the ANE in topological ferromagnets exceed the
highest values observed in conventional ferromagnets? Here, we report a

orbit of a magnetized black hole can lead to the shift of the orbital radius
outwards from the black hole. The effect causes increase of the energy and
angular momentum of the particle measured by an observer at rest at infinity.
In this note we show that ""widening"" of such orbits is independent of the field
configuration, however, it appears only in the cases with the external Lorentz
force acting outwards from the black hole. This condition corresponds to $q L B
> 0$, where $q$ and $L$ are the charge and angular momentum of the particle and
$B$ is intensity of the external magnetic field. As examples of the orbital
widening we consider two scenarios with an external homogeneous magnetic field
and a magnetic dipole field generated by a current loop around a Schwarzschild
black hole. We show that the orbital widening is accompanied by quasi-harmonic
oscillations of the particle which are considerably large in the magnetic
dipole fields. We also estimate the timescales of orbital widening from which
it follows that the effect can be relevant in the vicinity of stellar mass

shockwaves (discontinuities in conserved variables), rarefaction waves
(discontinuities in derivatives), and vacuum states (loss of strong
hyperbolicity). When ostensibly high-order numerical methods are applied in
such solution regimes, unphysical oscillations present themselves that can lead
to large errors and a breakdown of the numerical simulation. In this work we
develop a new Lax-Wendroff discontinuous Galerkin (LxW-DG) method with a
limiting strategy that keeps the solution non-oscillatory and
positivity-preserving for relevant variables, such as height in the shallow
water equations and density and pressure in the compressible Euler equations.
The proposed LxW-DG scheme updates the solution over each time-step with a
locally-implicit predictor followed by an explicit corrector. The
locally-implicit prediction phase is formulated in terms of primitive
variables, which greatly simplifies the solver. The resulting system of
nonlinear algebraic equations are approximately solved via a Picard iteration,
where the number of iterations is equal to the order of accuracy of the method.
The correction phase is an explicit evaluation formulated in terms of
conservative variables in order to guarantee numerical conservation. In order
to achieve full positivity-preservation, limiting is required in both the
prediction and correction steps. The resulting scheme is applied to several
standard test cases for the shallow water and compressible Euler equations. All
of the presented examples are written in a freely available open-source Python
code.

2 orders of magnitude compared to the current on-off ratio. By combining the EL
and current properties, we are able to identify two independent impact
ionization channels associated with the coherent resonant tunneling current and
the incoherent valley current. We also perform the same investigation with an
associated series resistance, which induces a bistable electrical output in the
system. By simulating a resistance variation for the current-voltage and the
EL, we are able to tune the EL on-off ratio by up to 6 orders of magnitude. We
further observe that the EL on and off states can be either direct or inverted
compared to the tunneling current on and off states. This electroluminescence,
combined with the unique RTD properties such as the negative differential

amounts to defining a lambda-algebra starting from a GoI Situation in a traced
symmetric monoidal category. We investigate this construction from the point of
view of the model theory of lambda-calculus. We focus on the strictly linear
and affine parts of Abramsky's Affine Combinatory Algebras, sketching how to
encompass the full algebra. The gist of our approach is that the GoI
interpretation of a term based on involutions is dual to the principal type of
the term, w.r.t. the type discipline for a linear/affine lambda-calculus. In
the general case the type discipline and the calculus need to be extended,
resp., with intersection, !-types, and !-abstractions. Our analysis unveils
three conceptually independent, but ultimately equivalent, accounts of
application in the lambda-calculus: beta-reduction, the GoI application of
involutions based on symmetric feedback (Girard's Execution Formula), and
unification of principal types. Thus we provide an answer, in the strictly
affine case, to the question raised in [1] of characterising the partial
involutions arising from bi-orthogonal pattern matching automata, which are
denotations of affine combinators, and we point to the answer to the full
question. Furthermore, we prove that the strictly linear combinatory algebra of
partial involutions is a strictly linear lambda-algebra, albeit not a
combinatory model, while both the strictly affine combinatory algebra and the
full affine combinatory algebra are not. To check all the equations involved in
the definition of affine lambda-algebra, we implement in Erlang application of
involutions.

semantic relational rule between two or more objects in an image: the MNIST
Parity task and the colorized Pentomino task. The objects in the images undergo
random translation, scaling, rotation and coloring transformations. Thus these
tasks involve invariant relational reasoning. We report uneven performance of
various deep CNN models on these two tasks. For the MNIST Parity task, we
report that the VGG19 model soundly outperforms a family of ResNet models.
Moreover, the family of ResNet models exhibits a general sensitivity to random
initialization for the MNIST Parity task. For the colorized Pentomino task, now
both the VGG19 and ResNet models exhibit sluggish optimization and very poor
test generalization, hovering around 30% test error. The CNN we tested all
learn hierarchies of fully distributed features and thus encode the distributed
representation prior. We are motivated by a hypothesis from cognitive
neuroscience which posits that the human visual cortex is modularized, and this
allows the visual cortex to learn higher order invariances. To this end, we
consider a modularized variant of the ResNet model, referred to as a Residual
Mixture Network (ResMixNet) which employs a mixture-of-experts architecture to
interleave distributed representations with more specialized, modular
representations. We show that very shallow ResMixNets are capable of learning
each of the two tasks well, attaining less than 2% and 1% test error on the
MNIST Parity and the colorized Pentomino tasks respectively. Most importantly,
the ResMixNet models are extremely parameter efficient: generalizing better
than various non-modular CNNs that have over 10x the number of parameters.
These experimental results support the hypothesis that modularity is a robust
prior for learning invariant relational reasoning.

independently from one of $k$ known distributions. The goal is to match each
observation to the distribution from which it was drawn. We observe that the
maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for this problem can be computed using
weighted bipartite matching, even when $n$, the number of observations per
distribution, exceeds one. This is achieved by instantiating $n$ duplicates of
each distribution node. However, in the regime where the number of observations
per distribution is much larger than the number of distributions, the Hungarian
matching algorithm for computing the weighted bipartite matching requires
$\mathcal O(n^3)$ time. We introduce a novel randomized matching algorithm that
reduces the runtime to $\tilde{\mathcal O}(n^2)$ by sparsifying the original
graph, returning the exact MLE with high probability. Next, we give statistical
justification for using the MLE by bounding the excess risk of the MLE, where
the loss is defined as the negative log-likelihood. We test these bounds for
the case of isotropic Gaussians with equal covariances and whose means are
separated by a distance $\eta$, and find (1) that $\gg \log k$ separation
suffices to drive the proportion of mismatches of the MLE to 0, and (2) that
the expected fraction of mismatched observations goes to zero at rate $\mathcal
O({(\log k)}^2/\eta^2)$.

detect onsets on another dataset, which denotes the importance of providing the

arises in numerous applications. However, existing nonparametric independence
tests typically require computation that scales at least quadratically with the

resampling is usually necessary to evaluate the statistical significance of the
resulting test statistics at finite sample sizes, further worsening the
computational burden. We introduce a scalable, resampling-free approach to
testing the independence between two random vectors by breaking down the task
into simple univariate tests of independence on a collection of 2x2 contingency
tables constructed through sequential coarse-to-fine discretization of the
sample space, transforming the inference task into a multiple testing problem
that can be completed with almost linear complexity with respect to the sample
size. To address increasing dimensionality, we introduce a coarse-to-fine
sequential adaptive procedure that exploits the spatial features of dependency
structures to more effectively examine the sample space. We derive a
finite-sample theory that guarantees the inferential validity of our adaptive
procedure at any given sample size. In particular, we show that our approach
can achieve strong control of the family-wise error rate without resampling or
large-sample approximation. We demonstrate the substantial computational
advantage of the procedure in comparison to existing approaches as well as its
decent statistical power under various dependency scenarios through an
extensive simulation study, and illustrate how the divide-and-conquer nature of

multiparametric contours that encode one given linguistic, paralinguistic and

outcome-adaptive lasso, a penalized regression technique for estimating the
propensity score that seeks to minimize the impact of instrumental variables on
treatment effect estimators. However, a notable limitation of this approach is
that its application is restricted to parametric models. We propose a more
flexible alternative that we call the outcome highly adaptive lasso. We discuss
large sample theory for this estimator and propose closed form confidence
intervals based on the proposed estimator. We show via simulation that our
method offers benefits over several popular approaches.

a small $\chi^{2}$, allow for large regions in parameter space and give

remain allowed although with a very constrained parameter space, which, in some

surrounding circumstellar disks. The impact of the accretion material on the
stellar atmosphere results in a strong shock, which causes emission from the
X-ray to the near-infrared (NIR) domain. Shock velocities of several 100 km
s$^{-1}$ imply that the immediate post shock plasma emits mainly in X-rays.
Indeed, two X-ray diagnostics, the so-called soft excess and the high densities
observed in He-like triplets, differentiate CTTSs from their non-accreting
siblings. However, accretion shock properties derived from X-ray diagnostics
often contradict established ultraviolet (UV)-NIR accretion tracers and a
physical model simultaneously explaining both, X-ray and UV-NIR accretion
tracers, is not yet available.
  We present new XMM-Newton and Chandra grating observations of the CTTS T
Tauri combined with UV and optical data. During all epochs, the soft excess is
large and the densities derived from the O VII and Ne IX He-like triplets are
compatible with coronal densities. This confirms that the soft X-ray emission
cannot originate in accretion funnels that carry the bulk of the accretion rate
despite T Tauri's large soft excess. Instead, we propose a model of radially
density stratified accretion columns to explain the density diagnostics and the
soft excess. In addition, accretion rate and X-ray luminosity are inversely
correlated in T Tauri over several epochs. Such an anti-correlation has been
observed in samples of stars. Hence the process causing it must be intrinsic to
the accretion process, and we speculate that the stellar magnetic field
configuration on the visibile hemisphere affects both the accretion rate and
the coronal emission, eventually causing the observed anti-correlation.

crystals, crystallographic THG is allowed in the electric-dipole approximation,
so that no strong magnetic-field-induced changes of the THG are expected.
Therefore, it comes as a total surprise that we observe a drastic enhancement
of the THG intensity by a factor of fifty for the $1s$-exciton-polariton in
GaAs in magnetic fields up to 10 T. In contrast, the corresponding enhancement
is moderate for CdTe and almost neglectful for ZnSe. In order to explain this
strong variation, we develop a microscopic theory accounting for the optical
harmonics generation on exciton-polaritons and analyze the THG mechanisms
induced by the magnetic field. The calculations show that the increase of THG
intensity is dominated by the magnetic field enhancement of the exciton
oscillator strength which is particularly strong for GaAs in the studied range
of field strengths. The much weaker increase of THG intensity in CdTe and ZnSe
is explained by the considerably larger exciton binding energies, leading to a
weaker modification of their oscillator strengths by the magnetic field.

user is connected to the Base Station via a multi-hop relay-assisted hybrid FSO
/ RF link with receive diversity. In this structure, received signal at each
relay is demodulated and forwarded. This is the first time that in a multi-hop
hybrid FSO / RF system, receive diversity is used. Bit Error Rate (BER) and
Outage Probability (P_out) are investigated as system performance criteria. New
exact and asymptotic expressions are derived for these criteria, and MATLAB
simulations are provided to verify the obtained results. For the first time
impact of number of receive antennas and number of relays on the performance of
such a structure is investigated. Results indicate that proposed structure has
low dependence on number of receive antennas; therefore, in the proposed
structure use of single receive antenna has the same performance as the
multi-antenna, while low complexity and power consumption. The proposed
structure shows independent performance at moderate and strong atmospheric
turbulence regimes. Hence, it does not require adaptive processing to match
itself according to atmospheric turbulence condition, therefore is cost
effective and particularly suitable for urban areas that encounter frequent
changes in atmospheric turbulence.

Bernoulli-Euler beam. The beam lies on the Winkler foundation with a point
inhomogeneity (a concentrated spring with negative time-varying stiffness). In
such a system with constant parameters (the spring stiffness), under certain
conditions a trapped mode of oscillation exists and is unique. Therefore,
applying a non-stationary external excitation to this system can lead to the
emergence of the beam oscillations localized near the inhomogeneity. We provide
an analytical description of non-stationary localized oscillations in the
system with time-varying properties using the asymptotic procedure based on
successive application of two asymptotic methods, namely the method of
stationary phase and the method of multiple scales. The obtained analytical
results were verified by independent numerical calculations. The applicability
of the analytical formulas was demonstrated for various types of external
excitation and laws governing the varying stiffness. In particular, we have
shown that in the case when the trapped mode frequency approaches zero,
localized low-frequency oscillations with increasing amplitude precede the
localized beam buckling. The dependence of the amplitude of such oscillations
on its frequency is more complicated in comparison with the case of a one
degree of freedom system with time-varying stiffness.

Coulomb collision operator at arbitrary collisionalities is introduced. Such
model is based on the expansion of the distribution function on a
Hermite-Laguerre polynomial basis, to study the effects of collisions on
magnetized plasma instabilities at arbitrary mean-free path. Focusing on the
drift-wave instability, we show that our framework allows retrieving
established collisional and collisionless limits. At the intermediate
collisionalities relevant for present and future magnetic nuclear fusion
devices, deviations with respect to collision operators used in
state-of-the-art turbulence simulation codes show the need for retaining the
full Coulomb operator in order to obtain both the correct instability growth
rate and eigenmode spectrum, which, for example, may significantly impact
quantitative predictions of transport. The exponential convergence of the
spectral representation that we propose makes the representation of the
velocity space dependence, including the full collision operator, more
efficient than standard finite difference methods.

for automated management of contracts with hierarchical conditionality
structures through an hierarchy of intelligent agents and the use of
hierarchical cryptographic key-pairs; (ii) a method for efficient and secure
matching and transfer of smart- contract underlyings (entities) among disparate
smart contracts/subcontracts; (iii) a method for producing an hierarchy of
common secrets to facilitate hierarchical communication channels of increased
security in the context of smart contracts/subcontracts/underlyings; and (iv) a
method for building secure and optimized repositories through distributed hash
tables in the context of contracts/ subcontracts/underlyings. These methods
help providing services that allow both narrower and worldwide reach and
distribution of resources. The longevity of the blockchain technology is
achieved through continuous innovation. Blockchain-enabled services are
potentially an efficient, secure, automated, and cost-effective alternative or
complement to current service infrastructures in a range of domains (legal,
medical, financial, government, IoT).

graphite or copper oxide micro/nano particles) and classical solar still is
carried out, based on the productivity and the thermal performance. Exergy
destructions in various components of the solar stills have been calculated,
analyzed and discussed. Evaporation is faster and the exergy of evaporation is
higher at the modified solar stills than that of the classical one.
Furthermore, the energy and exergy efficiencies of the modified stills are
enhanced compared with the classical one. A brief discussion regarding the
effect of different parameters on solar stills efficiency is also presented.
The daytime energy efficiency of graphite/water and copper oxide/water mixtures
are 41.18% and 38.61%, respectively, but for the classical still is only
29.17%. Moreover, the daytime exergy efficiencies of graphite, copper oxide
nanofluid based stills and classical still are 4.32%, 3.78% and 2.63%,
respectively.

nanocomposite and the effectiveness of this composite in decolorizing and
degrading Methylene Blue (MB). Tin Oxide was prepared by liquid phase
co-precipitation method and reduced Graphene Oxide-Tin Oxide (rGO-SnO2)
nanocomposite was prepared by solution mixing method. Tin Oxide nanoparticles
(NPs) have been ardently investigated as photocatalyst for water purification
and environment decontamination but the photon generated electron and hole pair
(EHP) recombination is one of the limiting factors. Reduced Graphene Oxide-Tin
Oxide (rGO-SnO2) nanocomposite is very efficient to overcome this limitation
for photocatalytic application. The as-synthesized GO, SnO2, GO-SnO2, rGO and
rGO-SnO2 nanocomposite were characterized by X-ray Diffraction, Scanning
Electron Microscopy, Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Fourier Transform
Infrared spectroscopy. The XRD data confirms the sharp peak at 2Theta=10.44
degree corresponding to (002) reflection of GO with interlayer d spacing of
8.46 Angstrom indication of successful preparation of GO by oxidation of
graphite. Moreover, the diffraction peak shifts from 2Theta=10.44 degree to
2Theta=23.31 degree confirm successful synthesis of rGO as well. SEM image
shows the morphology of all the photocatalysts. EDX studies are carried out to
investigate the elemental composition and purity of the sample by giving all
the elements present in the nanomaterials. The presence of functional groups
was identified by FTIR. The rGO-SnO2 (1:10) nanocomposite shows an efficient
photodegradation efficiency of ~94% and ~95% under natural sunlight and UV
light irradiation respectively for Methylene Blue (MB) within 15 minutes.
Furthermore, the degradation kinetics of MB is also studied in this paper as
well.
