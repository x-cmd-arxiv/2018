especially in men. Polyps are one of the main causes of colorectal cancer and
early diagnosis of polyps by colonoscopy could result in successful treatment.
Diagnosis of polyps in colonoscopy videos is a challenging task due to
variations in the size and shape of polyps. In this paper we proposed a polyp
segmentation method based on convolutional neural network. Performance of the
method is enhanced by two strategies. First, we perform a novel image patch
selection method in the training phase of the network. Second, in the test
phase, we perform an effective post processing on the probability map that is
produced by the network. Evaluation of the proposed method using the
CVC-ColonDB database shows that our proposed method achieves more accurate
results in comparison with previous colonoscopy video-segmentation methods.

cation C60+ resulted in accurate rest wavelengths for five C60+ transitions
that have been compared with diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) in the near
infra-red. Detecting these in astronomical spectra is difficult due to the
strong contamination of ground-based spectra by atmospheric water vapor, to the
presence of weak and shallow stellar lines and/or blending with other weak
DIBs. The detection of the two strong bands has been claimed by several teams,
and the three additional and weaker bands have been detected in a few sources.
Certain recent papers have argued against the identification of C60+ based on
spectral analyses claiming (i) a large variation in the ratio between the
equivalent widths of the 9632 and 9577\AA\: bands, (ii) a large redshift of the
9632\AA\: band for the Orion star HD 37022, and (iii) the non-detection of the
weaker 9428\AA~DIB. Here we address these three points. (i) We show that the
model stellar line correction for the 9632\AA~DIB overestimates the difference
between the strengths of the lines in giant and dwarf star spectra, casting
doubts on the conclusions about the ratio variability. (ii) Using high quality
stellar spectra from the ESO Diffuse Interstellar Bands Large Exploration
Survey (EDIBLES), recorded with the ESO/Paranal Ultraviolet Echelle
Spectrograph (UVES) in about the same atmospheric conditions, we find no
wavelength shift in the 9632\AA\ band towards HD 37022. (iii) Using EDIBLES
spectra and data from the Echelle SpectroPolarimetric Device for the
Observation of Stars (ESPaDOnS) at CFHT we show that the presence of a weak

arbitrary meshes. We show that the regularized Heaviside function can be
non-smooth on non-uniform meshes. Alternative regularizing definitions that are
indeed smooth and monotonic, are introduced. These new definitions lead to
smooth Heaviside functions by taking the changing local meshsize into account.
The second issue is the computational cost and fragility caused by the
necessity of redistancing the level-set field. In previous papers it is shown
that strongly coupling the level-set convection with the flow solver provides
robustness and potentially efficiency and accuracy advantages. The next step
would be to include redistancing within the strong coupling part of the
algorithm. The computational cost of current redistancing procedure prohibit
this. Four alternative approaches for circumventing the expensive redistancing
step are proposed. This should facilitate a fully coupled level-set approach.
Some benchmark cases demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approaches. These
includes the standard test case of the vortex in a box. Based on these results
the most favorable redistancing approach is selected.

  Programming",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a semidefinite programming based method for estimating
moments of a stochastic hybrid system (SHS). For polynomial SHSs -- which
consist of polynomial continuous vector fields, reset maps, and transition
intensities -- the dynamics of moments evolve according to a system of linear
ordinary differential equations. However, it is generally not possible to solve
the system exactly since time evolution of a specific moment may depend upon
moments of order higher than it. One way to overcome this problem is to employ
so-called moment closure methods that give point approximations to moments, but
these are limited in that accuracy of the estimations is unknown. We find lower
and upper bounds on a moment of interest via a semidefinite program that
includes linear constraints obtained from moment dynamics, along with
semidefinite constraints that arise from the non-negativity of moment matrices.
These bounds are further shown to improve as the size of semidefinite program
is increased. The key insight in the method is a reduction from stochastic
hybrid systems with multiple discrete modes to a single-mode hybrid system with
algebraic constraints. We further extend the scope of the proposed method to a
class of non-polynomial SHSs which can be recast to polynomial SHSs via
augmentation of additional states. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of
results via examples of SHSs drawn from different disciplines.

and the $C^{2}$-immersed part of it is stable with respect to the area
functional for volume preserving deformations, its support, except possibly on
a closed set of codimension $7$, is an immersed constant-mean-curvature (cmc)
hypersurface of class $C^{2}$ that can fail to be embedded only at points where
locally the support is the union of two $C^{2}$ embedded cmc disks with only
tangential intersection. Both structural conditions are necessary for the
conclusions and involve only those parts of the varifold that are made up of
embedded $C^{1, \alpha}$-regular pieces coming together in a regular fashion,
making them easy to check in principle. We show also that any family of
codimension 1 integral varifolds satisfying these structural and variational
hypotheses as well as locally uniform mass and mean curvature bounds is compact

the second author (for stable minimal hypersurfaces) and the regularity theory

textual properties from different angles of abusive posting behavior. We

any tuning of the model architecture for each task. We test the proposed
approach with multiple datasets addressing different and multiple abusive

generate frequency comb (FC) utilizing the Kerr nonlinearity. Most of the
nonlinear materials used to build photonic platforms exhibit nonlinear losses
such as multi-photon absorption, free-carrier absorption (FCA), and
free-carrier dispersion (FCD) which can strongly affect the nonlinear
characteristics of the devices made out of these materials. In this work, we
model the Kerr FC based on modified Lugiato-Lefever Equation (LLE) along with
the rate equation and develop analytical formulations to make quick estimations
of the steady-state, modulation instability (MI) gain, bandwidth and the
dynamics of Kerr Frequency-Comb (FC) in presence of nonlinear losses. Our
analytical model is valid over a broad wavelength range of interest as it
includes the effects of all nonlinear losses. Higher order (>3) characteristic
polynomial of intra-cavity power describing the steady-state homogeneous
solution of the modified LLE are discussed in detail. We derive the generalized
analytical expressions for the threshold of normalized pump detuning to
initiate the optical bistability which is a necessary condition for the FC
generation. Free-carrier dispersion-led nonlinear cavity detuning is observed
through the reverse Kerr-tilt of the resonant-peaks. We further deduce the
expressions for the threshold pump intensity and the range of possible cavity
detuning for the initiation of the MI when all the nonlinear losses are
present. To corroborate our analytical findings, LLE along with the rate
equations are solved numerically through split-step Fourier method. Our
theoretical study can explain several experimental results which are previously
reported and thereby is able to provide a better understanding of the comb
dynamics.

infinite derivative ghost and singularity free theory of gravity in the static
limit. We have found that in the region of non-locality, in the ultraviolet
regime (at short distance from the source), the Ricci tensor and the Ricci
scalar are not vanishing, meaning that we do not have a vacuum solution anymore
due to the smearing of the source induced by the presence of non-local
gravitational interactions. It also follows that, unlike in Einstein's gravity,
the Riemann tensor is not traceless and it does not coincide with the Weyl
tensor. Secondly, these curvatures are regularized at short distances such that
they are singularity-free, in particular the same happens for the Kretschmann
invariant. Unlike the others, the Weyl tensor vanishes at short distances,
implying that the spacetime metric becomes conformally flat in the region of
non-locality, in the ultraviolet. As a consequence, the non-local region can be
approximated by a conformally flat manifold with non-negative constant
curvatures. We briefly discuss the solution in the non-linear regime, and argue
that $1/r$ metric potential cannot be the solution where non-locality is
important in the ultraviolet regime.

these word embeddings to downstream biomedical applications. However, there has

conclusions. First, the word embeddings trained on clinical notes and
biomedical publications can capture the semantics of medical terms better, and
find more relevant similar medical terms, and are closer to human experts'
judgments, compared to these trained on Wikipedia and news. Second, there does
not exist a consistent global ranking of word embedding quality for downstream
biomedical NLP applications. However, adding word embeddings as extra features
will improve results on most downstream tasks. Finally, the word embeddings
trained on biomedical domain corpora do not necessarily have better performance

Our method infers parameters of interest without additional assumptions about

Our method also works reliably at low noise levels and with little data because

two- and three-planet configurations have been selected, with diversified
masses, semi-major axes (resonant configurations or not), eccentricities and
inclinations (including coplanar systems) at the dispersal of the gas disc. We
have then followed the gravitational interactions of these systems with an
inner disc of planetesimals and embryos (9 runs per system), studying in detail
the final configurations of the formed terrestrial planets. While coplanar
giant systems harbour several terrestrial planets, generally as massive as the
Earth and mainly on low eccentric and low inclined orbits, terrestrial planets
formed in systems with mutually inclined giant planets are usually fewer, less

  Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers, October 2018",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a distributed computing framework where the distributed nodes
have different communication capabilities, motivated by the heterogeneous
networks in data centers and mobile edge computing systems. Following the
structure of MapReduce, this framework consists of Map computation phase,
Shuffle phase, and Reduce computation phase. The Shuffle phase allows
distributed nodes to exchange intermediate values, in the presence of
heterogeneous communication bottlenecks for different nodes (heterogeneous
communication load constraints). For this setting, we characterize the minimum
total computation load and the minimum worst-case computation load in some
cases, under the heterogeneous communication load constraints. While the total
computation load depends on the sum of the computation loads of all the nodes,
the worst-case computation load depends on the computation load of a node with
the heaviest job. We show an interesting insight that, for some cases, there is
a tradeoff between the minimum total computation load and the minimum
worst-case computation load, in the sense that both cannot be achieved at the
same time. The achievability schemes are proposed with careful design on the
file assignment and the data shuffling. Beyond the cut-set bound, a novel
converse is proposed using the proof by contradiction. For the general case, we
identify two extreme regimes in which both the scheme with coding and the
scheme without coding are optimal, respectively.

in a critical way on the theoretical uncertainty associated with the

topologies that account for $b$-jet production in association with a $t\bar{t}$
pair, we demonstrate that the process at hand is largely driven by final-state
$g\to b\bar{b}$ splittings. We also show that in five-flavour simulations based
on $t\bar{t}+$multi-jet merging $b$-jet production is mostly driven by the
parton shower, while matrix elements play only a marginal role in the
description of $g\to b\bar{b}$ splittings. Based on these observations we
advocate the use of NLOPS simulations of $pp\to t\bar{t}b\bar{b}$ in the
four-flavour scheme, and we present a new POWHEG generator of this kind.
Predictions and uncertainties for $t\bar{t}+b$-jet observables at the 13 TeV
LHC are presented both for the case of stable top quarks and with
spin-correlated top decays. Besides QCD scale variations we consider also
theoretical uncertainties related to the POWHEG matching method and to the
parton shower modelling, with emphasis on $g\to b\bar{b}$ splittings. In
general, matching and shower uncertainties turn out to be remarkably small.
This is confirmed also by a tuned comparison against Sherpa+OpenLoops.

drastically alter its surface composition, leading to extreme chemical
peculiarities. We consider the case of hot subdwarfs, where surface helium
abundances range from practically zero to almost 100 percent. Since hot
subdwarfs can form via a number of different evolution channels, a key question
concerns how the formation mechanism is connected to the present surface
chemistry. A sequence of extreme horizontal branch star models was generated by
producing post-common envelope stars from red giants. Evolution was computed
with MESA from envelope ejection up to core-helium ignition. Surface abundances
were calculated at the zero-age horizontal branch for models with and without
diffusion. A number of simulations also included radiative levitation. The goal
was to study surface chemistry during evolution from cool giant to hot subdwarf
and determine when the characteristic subdwarf surface is established. Only
stars leaving the giant branch close to core-helium ignition become
hydrogen-rich subdwarfs at the zero-age horizontal branch. Diffusion, including
radiative levitation, depletes the initial surface helium in all cases. All
subdwarf models rapidly become more depleted than observations allow. Surface
abundances of other elements follow observed trends in general, but not in
detail. Additional physics is required.

within its uncertainty in order to simulate a range of orbital geometries and
closest approach distances. Treating the MW and M31 as point masses, we follow
the trajectories of surrounding test particle disks, thereby mapping out the
tidal debris distribution.
  Around each galaxy, the resulting tidal debris tends to cluster around a
particular orbital pole. We find some models in which these preferred spin
vectors align fairly well with those of the corresponding observed satellite
planes. The radial distributions of material in the simulated satellite planes
are similar to what we observe. Around the MW, our best-fitting model yields a
significant fraction (0.22) of counter-rotating material, perhaps explaining
why Sculptor counter-rotates within the MW satellite plane. In contrast, our
model yields no counter-rotating material around M31. This is testable with
proper motions of M31 satellites.
  In our best model, the MW disk is thickened by the flyby 7.65 Gyr ago to a
root mean square height of 0.75 kpc. This is similar to the observed age and
thickness of the Galactic thick disk. Thus, the MW thick disk may have formed

ambient gas. We investigate the evolution of the binary system after a shock

companion's separation and eccentricity. We show that our analytic criterion

resolution, all of our sources show some degree of polarization, with most
(9/10) showing significantly extended emission in the polarized continuum. Each
source has incredibly intricate polarization signatures. In particular, all
three disk-candidates have polarization vectors roughly along the minor axis,
which is indicative of polarization produced by dust scattering. On $\sim$ 100
au scales, the polarization is at a relatively low level ($\lesssim 1\%$) and
is quite ordered. In sources with significant envelope emission, the envelope
is typically polarized at a much higher ($\gtrsim 5\%$) level and has a far
more disordered morphology. We compute the cumulative probability distributions
for both the small (disk-scale) and large (envelope-scale) polarization
percentage. We find that the two are intrinsically different, even after
accounting for the different detection thresholds in the high/low surface
brightness regions. We perform Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Anderson-Darling tests on
the distributions of angle offsets of the polarization from the outflow axis.
We find disk-candidate sources are different from the non-disk-candidate
sources. We conclude that the polarization on the 100 au scale is consistent
with the signature of dust scattering for disk-candidates and that the
polarization on the envelope-scale in all sources may come from another
mechanism, most likely magnetically aligned grains.

instance of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless physics in which only two phases
exist: a superconductor with algebraic long range order in which the vortices
condense and an insulator where the vortex-antivortex pairs proliferate.
However, since 1989 this view has been challenged as now a preponderance of
experiments indicate that an intervening bosonic metallic state obtains upon
the destruction of superconductivity. We review here a glassy model which is
capable of capturing both of these features. The finite resistance arises from
three features. First, the disordered insulator-superconductor transition in
the absence of fermionic degrees of freedom (Cooper pairs only), is controlled
by a diffusive fixed point\cite{CN} rather than the critical point of the clean
system. Hence, the relevant physics that generates the Bose metal should arise
from a term in the action in which different replicas are mixed. We show
explicitly how such physics arises in the phase glass. Second, in 2D (not in
3D) the phase stiffness of the glass phase vanishes explicitly as has been
shown in extensive numerical simulations\cite{ky,kosterlitz1,kosterlitz2}.
Third, bosons moving in such a glassy environment fail to localize as a result
of the false minima in the landscape. We calculate the conductivity explicitly
using Kubo response and show that it turns on as a power law and has a
vanishing Hall response as a result of underlying particle-hole symmetry. We
show that when particle-hole symmetry is broken, the Hall conductance turns on
with the same power law as does the longitudinal conductance.

single-dish submillimetre (submm) sources are blends of multiple submm galaxies
(SMGs), but the nature of this multiplicity, i.e. whether the galaxies are
physically associated or chance projections, has not been determined. We
performed spectroscopy of 11 SMGs in six multi-component submm sources,
obtaining spectroscopic redshifts for nine of them. For an additional two
component SMGs, we detected continuum emission but no obvious features. We
supplement our observed sources with four sources from the literature. This
sample allows us to statistically constrain the physical nature of single-dish
submm source multiplicity for the first time. In three [3/7, or 43 (-33/+39)
per cent at 95% confidence] of the single-dish sources for which the nature of
the blending is unambiguous, the components for which spectroscopic redshifts
are available are physically associated, whereas 4/7 [57 (-39/+33) per cent]
have at least one unassociated component. When components whose spectra exhibit
continuum but no features and for which the photometric redshift is
significantly different from the spectroscopic redshift of the other component
are also considered, 6/9 [67 (-37/+26) per cent] of the single-dish sources are
comprised of at least one unassociated component. The nature of the
multiplicity of one single-dish source is ambiguous. We conclude that
physically associated systems and chance projections both contribute to the
multi-component single-dish submm source population. This result contradicts
the conventional wisdom that bright submm sources are solely a result of
merger-induced starbursts, as blending of unassociated galaxies is also
important.

populations of the Milky Way (MW) bulge, with the two leading scenarios being
that these populations are either i) part of a classical metal-poor spheroid or
ii) the same population as the chemically defined thick disc seen at the Solar
neighbourhood. Here we test whether the latter scenario can reproduce the
observed chemical properties of the MW bulge. To do so we compare an N-body
simulation of a composite (thin+thick) stellar disc -- which evolves secularly
to form a bar and a boxy/peanut (b/p) bulge -- to data from APOGEE DR13. This
model, in which the thick disc is massive and centrally concentrated, can
reproduce the morphology of the metal-rich and metal-poor stellar populations
in the bulge, as well as the mean metallicity and [$\alpha$/Fe] maps as
obtained from the APOGEE data. It also reproduces the trends, in both longitude
and latitude, of the bulge metallicity distribution function (MDF).
Additionally, we show that the model predicts small but measurable azimuthal
metallicity variations in the inner disc due to the differential mapping of the
thin and thick disc in the bar. We therefore see that the chemo-morphological
relations of stellar populations in the MW bulge are naturally reproduced by
mapping the thin and thick discs of the inner MW into a b/p.

gravitationally lensed galaxy, the 'Cosmic Horseshoe' (J1148+1930) at z=2.38.
Our gravitational lens model shows that the system is made up of four
star-forming regions, each ~4-8 kpc^2 in size, from which we extract four
spatially exclusive regional spectra. We study the interstellar and wind
absorption lines, along with CIII] doublet emission lines, in each region to
investigate any variation in emission/absorption line properties. The mapped
CIII] emission shows distinct kinematical structure, with velocity offsets of
~+/-50 km/s between regions suggestive of a merging system, and a variation in
equivalent width that indicates a change in ionisation parameter and/or
metallicity between the regions. Absorption line velocities reveal a range of
outflow strengths, with gas outflowing between -200<v(km/s)<-50 relative to the
systemic velocity of that region. Interestingly, the strongest gas outflow
appears to emanate from the most diffuse star-forming region. The
star-formation rates remain relatively constant (~8-16 M_sol/yr), mostly due to
large uncertainties in reddening estimates. As such, the outflows appear to be
'global' rather than 'locally' sourced. We measure electron densities with a
range of log(Ne)=3.92-4.36 cm^-3, and point out that such high densities may be
common when measured using the CIII] doublet due to its large critical density.
Overall, our observations demonstrate that while it is possible to trace
variations in large scale gas kinematics, detecting inhomogeneities in physical
gas properties and their effects on the outflowing gas may be more difficult.
This study provides important lessons for the spatially-resolved rest-frame UV
studies expected with future observatories, such as JWST.

dynamical behaviors are understood at the level of the underlying linear
Markovian dynamics in terms of metastability, i.e. the appearance of gaps in
the upper real part of the spectrum of the Markov generator. Stochastic
thermodynamics is used to study the dissipated work across dynamical phases as
well as across scales. This dissipated work is found to be reduced by the
attractive interactions between the units and to nontrivially depend on the
system size. When operating as a work-to-work converter, we find that the
maximum power output is achieved far-from-equilibrium in the synchronization

rate of general relativistic (GR) precession in the test particle limit.
However, it has not been demonstrated that this mechanism can drive such a
fast, coherent precession of a radially extended (out to $1 R_\odot$) gaseous
disk mediated by internal stresses (pressure). Here we use the linear theory of
eccentricity evolution in hydrodynamic disks to determine several key
properties of eccentric modes in gaseous debris disks around WDs. We find a
critical dependence of both the precession period and radial eccentricity
distribution of the modes on the inner disk radius, $r_\mathrm{in}$. For small
inner radii, $r_\mathrm{in} \lesssim (0.2 - 0.4) R_\odot$, the modes are
GR-driven, with periods of $\approx 1 - 10$ yr. For $r_\mathrm{in} \gtrsim (0.2
- 0.4) R_\odot$, the modes are pressure-dominated, with periods of $\approx 3 -
20$ yr. Correspondence between the variability periods and inferred inner radii
of the observed disks is in general agreement with this trend. In particular,
the short period of HE 1349--2305 is consistent with its small $r_\mathrm{in}$.
Circum-WD debris disks may thus serve as natural laboratories for studying the
evolution of eccentric gaseous disks.

the disc and dark halo remains uncertain and depends on the adopted mass to
light ratio (M/L) of the disc. Given the vertical velocity dispersion of stars
and disc scale height, the disc surface mass density and hence the M/L can be
estimated. We address a conceptual problem with previous measurements of the
scale height and dispersion. When using this method, the dispersion and scale
height must refer to the same population of stars. The scale height is obtained
from near-IR studies of edge-on galaxies and is weighted towards older
kinematically hotter stars, whereas the dispersion obtained from integrated
light in the optical bands includes stars of all ages. We aim to extract the
dispersion for the hotter stars, so that it can then be used with the correct
scale height to obtain the disc surface mass density. We use a sample of
planetary nebulae (PNe) as dynamical tracers in the face-on galaxy NGC 628. We
extract two different dispersions from its velocity histogram -- representing
the older and younger PNe. We also present complementary stellar absorption
spectra in the inner regions of this galaxy and use a direct pixel fitting
technique to extract the two components. Our analysis concludes that previous
studies, which do not take account of the young disc, underestimate the disc
surface mass density by a factor of ~ 2. This is sufficient to make a maximal
disc for NGC 628 appear like a submaximal disc.

puzzling, as our measured flux ratios, radii, and masses imply a $\sim$ 200 Myr
age difference between the components using standard stellar evolution models.
Possible explanations for this age discrepancy include mass transfer scenarios

of surfactant molecules induces a reduction of membrane surface area at almost
constant vesicle volume. This results in a rate-dependent increase of membrane
tension and leads to the opening of a micron-sized pore. We show that
solubilization kinetics due to surfactants can determine the regimes of pore
dynamics: either the pores open and reseal within a second (short-lived pore),
or the pore stays open up to a few minutes (long-lived pore). First, we
validate our model with previously published experimental measurements of pore
dynamics. Then, we investigate how the solubilization kinetics and membrane
properties affect the dynamics of the pore and construct a phase diagram for
short and long-lived pores. Finally, we examine the dynamics of sequential pore
openings and show that cyclic short-lived pores occur at a period inversely
proportional to the solubilization rate. By deriving a theoretical expression

total drag can be either reduced or increased by more than $20\%$ by adjusting
the permeability directional properties. Drag reduction is achieved for the
case of materials with permeability in the vertical direction lower than the
one in the wall-parallel planes. This configuration limits the wall normal
velocity at the interface while promoting an increase of the tangential slip
velocity leading to an almost ""one-component"" turbulence where the low- and
high-speed streaks coherence is strongly enhanced. On the other hand, strong
drag increase is found when a high wall-normal and low wall-parallel
permeabilities are prescribed. In this condition, the enhancement of the
wall-normal fluctuations due to the reduced wall-blocking effect triggers the
onset of structures which are strongly correlated in the spanwise direction, a
phenomenon observed by other authors in flows over isotropic porous layers or
over ribletted walls with large protrusion heights. The use of anisotropic
porous walls for drag reduction is particularly attractive since equal gains
can be achieved at different Reynolds numbers by rescaling the magnitude of the

critical exponents converge rapidly when higher powers of the scalar curvature

present high-speed photometry of Gaia14aae, an AM CVn with a binary period of
49.7 minutes and the first AM CVn in which the central white dwarf is fully
eclipsed by the donor star. Modelling of the lightcurves of this system allows
for the most precise measurement to date of the donor mass of an AM CVn, and
relies only on geometric and well-tested physical assumptions. We find a mass
ratio $q = M_2/M_1 = 0.0287 \pm 0.0020$ and masses $M_1 = 0.87 \pm 0.02
M_\odot$ and $M_2 = 0.0250 \pm 0.0013 M_\odot$. We compare these properties to
the three proposed channels for AM CVn formation. Our measured donor mass and
radius do not fit with the contraction that is predicted for AM CVn donors
descended from white dwarfs or helium stars at long orbital periods. The donor
properties we measure fall in a region of parameter space in which systems
evolved from hydrogen-dominated cataclysmic variables are expected, but such
systems should show spectroscopic hydrogen, which is not seen in Gaia14aae. The
evolutionary history of this system is therefore not clear. We consider a
helium-burning star or an evolved cataclysmic variable to be the most likely
progenitors, but both models require additional processes and/or fine-tuning to
fit the data. Additionally, we calculate an updated ephemeris which corrects

natural language understanding techniques. Once the goal is known, the bot must
manage a dialogue to achieve that goal, which is conducted with respect to a
learnt policy. The success of the dialogue system depends on the quality of the
policy, which is in turn reliant on the availability of high-quality training
data for the policy learning method, for instance Deep Reinforcement Learning.
  Due to the domain specificity, the amount of available data is typically too
low to allow the training of good dialogue policies. In this paper we introduce
a transfer learning method to mitigate the effects of the low in-domain data
availability. Our transfer learning based approach improves the bot's success
rate by 20% in relative terms for distant domains and we more than double it
for close domains, compared to the model without transfer learning. Moreover,
the transfer learning chatbots learn the policy up to 5 to 10 times faster.
Finally, as the transfer learning approach is complementary to additional
processing such as warm-starting, we show that their joint application gives
the best outcomes.

structure defects effect on the centroid measurement accuracy of a
Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor. We use the first moment centroid method to
estimate the centroid of a focused Gaussian beam sampled by a simulated bundle.
Spot estimation accuracy with wound fibre image bundle and its structure impact
on wavefront measurement accuracy statistics are addressed. Our results show
that when the measurement signal to noise ratio is high, the centroid
measurement accuracy is dominated by the wound fibre image bundle structure,
e.g. tile angle and gap spacing. For the measurement with low signal to noise
ratio, its accuracy is influenced by the read noise of the detector instead of
the wound fibre image bundle structure defects. We demonstrate this both with
simulation and experimentally. We provide a statistical model of the centroid

discretize the scalar-QED action on a lattice, in a way that respects geometric

can then be solved, in the classical-statistics regime, by advancing an
ensemble of statistically equivalent initial conditions in time, using

  Time Dependent Hamilton-Jacobi Equations",,,"10.1016/j.jcp.2018.11.037",,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a class of high order numerical schemes is proposed for
solving Hamilton-Jacobi (H-J) equations. This work is regarded as an extension
of our previous work for nonlinear degenerate parabolic equations, see
Christlieb et al. \emph{arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.09294},, which relies on a
special kernel-based formulation of the solutions and successive convolution.
When applied to the H-J equations, the newly proposed scheme attains genuinely
high order accuracy in both space and time, and more importantly, it is
unconditionally stable, hence allowing for much larger time step evolution
compared with other explicit schemes and saving computational cost. A high
order weighted essentially non-oscillatory methodology and a novel nonlinear
filter are further incorporated to capture the correct viscosity solution.
Furthermore, by coupling the recently proposed inverse Lax-Wendroff boundary
treatment technique, this method is very flexible in handing complex geometry
as well as general boundary conditions. We perform numerical experiments on a
collection of numerical examples, including H-J equations with linear,
nonlinear, convex or non-convex Hamiltonians. The efficacy and efficiency of
the proposed scheme in approximating the viscosity solution of general H-J
equations is verified.

The distribution of (FUV $-$ NUV) shows that the color declines with increasing
effective temperature for stars hotter than 7000 K in our sample, while the
trend disappears for the cooler stars due to upper atmosphere emission from the
regions higher than their photospheres. For stars with valid stellar
parameters, we calculate the UV excesses with synthetic model spectra, and find
that the (FUV $-$ NUV) vs. $R'_{\mathrm{FUV}}$ can be fitted with a linear
relation and late-type dwarfs tend to have high UV excesses. There are 87,178
and 1,498,103 stars detected more than once in the visit exposures of $GALEX$
in the FUV and NUV, respectively. We make use of the quantified photometric
errors to determine statistical properties of the UV variation, including
intrinsic variability and the structure function on the timescale of days. The
overall occurrence of possible false positives is below 1.3\% in our sample. UV
absolute magnitudes are calculated for stars with valid parallaxes, which could
serve as a possible reference frame in the NUV. We conclude that the colors
related to UV provide good criteria to distinguish between M giants and M

patients with complex diseases and co-existing conditions. However, a major
consequence of polypharmacy is a much higher risk of adverse side effects for
the patient. Polypharmacy side effects emerge because of drug-drug
interactions, in which activity of one drug may change if taken with another
drug. The knowledge of drug interactions is limited because these complex
relationships are rare, and are usually not observed in relatively small
clinical testing. Discovering polypharmacy side effects thus remains an
important challenge with significant implications for patient mortality. Here,
we present Decagon, an approach for modeling polypharmacy side effects. The
approach constructs a multimodal graph of protein-protein interactions,
drug-protein target interactions, and the polypharmacy side effects, which are
represented as drug-drug interactions, where each side effect is an edge of a
different type. Decagon is developed specifically to handle such multimodal
graphs with a large number of edge types. Our approach develops a new graph
convolutional neural network for multirelational link prediction in multimodal
networks. Decagon predicts the exact side effect, if any, through which a given
drug combination manifests clinically. Decagon accurately predicts polypharmacy
side effects, outperforming baselines by up to 69%. We find that it
automatically learns representations of side effects indicative of
co-occurrence of polypharmacy in patients. Furthermore, Decagon models
particularly well side effects with a strong molecular basis, while on
predominantly non-molecular side effects, it achieves good performance because
of effective sharing of model parameters across edge types. Decagon creates
opportunities to use large pharmacogenomic and patient data to flag and
prioritize side effects for follow-up analysis.

spin structure factors (DSFs) of three ab-initio models and one
ab-initio-guided model for a honeycomb-lattice magnet $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. We
also use thermal pure quantum states to calculate the temperature dependence of
the heat capacity, the nearest-neighbor (NN) spin-spin correlation function,
and the static spin structure factor. From the results obtained from these four
effective models, we find that, even when the magnetic order is stabilized at
low temperature, the intensity at the $\Gamma$ point in the DSFs increases with
increasing NN spin correlation. In addition, we find that the four models fail
to explain heat-capacity measurements whereas two of the four models succeed in
explaining inelastic-neutron-scattering (INS) experiments. In the four models,
when temperature decreases, the heat capacity shows a prominent peak at a high
temperature where the NN spin-spin correlation function increases. However, the
peak temperature in heat capacity is too low in comparison with that observed
experimentally. To address these discrepancies, we propose an effective model
that includes strong ferromagnetic Kitaev coupling, and we show that this model
quantitatively reproduces both INS experiments and heat-capacity measurements.
To further examine the adequacy of the proposed model, we calculate the field
dependence of the polarized terahertz spectra, which reproduces the
experimental results: the spin-gapped excitation survives up to an onset field
where the magnetic order disappears and the response in the high-field region
is almost linear. Based on these numerical results, we argue that the
low-energy magnetic excitation in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ is mainly characterized by
interactions such as off-diagonal interactions and weak Heisenberg interactions
between NN pairs, rather than by the strong Kitaev interactions.

temperatures. We find that, if the connections between core and periphery
increase linearly with network size, the first peak does not exhibit any
size-dependent effect, and the second one diverges in the limit of infinite
network size. Otherwise, if the connections between core and periphery scale
sub-linearly with the network size, both peaks of the susceptibility diverge as
power laws in the thermodynamic limit. This suggests the appearance of a double
transition phenomenon in the Ising model for the latter case. Moreover, we

findings seem to favor the scenario that green galaxies are at transitional
phase when star-forming galaxies are being quenched into quiescent status. The
green galaxies at z<2 show the highest AGN fraction, suggesting that AGN
feedback may have played an important role in star formation quenching. For the
massive galaxies at 2<z<2.5, both red and green galaxies are found to have a
similarly higher AGN fraction than the blue ones, which implies that AGN
feedback may help to keep quiescence of red galaxies at z>2. A significant

distributions, suggesting that environment quenching is not the major mechanism

comprised of vertically stacked two-dimensional (2D) building blocks, which
provide us with a vast tool set to engineer their properties on top of the
already rich tunability of 2D materials. One of the knobs, the twist angle
between different layers, plays a crucial role in the ultimate electronic
properties of a vdW heterostructure and does not have a direct analog in other
systems such as MBE-grown semiconductor heterostructures. For small twist
angles, the moir\'e pattern produced by the lattice misorientation creates a
long-range modulation. So far, the study of the effect of twist angles in vdW
heterostructures has been mostly concentrated in graphene/hexagonal boron
nitride (h-BN) twisted structures, which exhibit relatively weak interlayer
interaction due to the presence of a large bandgap in h-BN. Here we show that
when two graphene sheets are twisted by an angle close to the theoretically
predicted 'magic angle', the resulting flat band structure near charge
neutrality gives rise to a strongly-correlated electronic system. These flat
bands exhibit half-filling insulating phases at zero magnetic field, which we
show to be a Mott-like insulator arising from electrons localized in the
moir\'e superlattice. These unique properties of magic-angle twisted bilayer
graphene (TwBLG) open up a new playground for exotic many-body quantum phases
in a 2D platform made of pure carbon and without magnetic field. The easy
accessibility of the flat bands, the electrical tunability, and the bandwidth
tunability though twist angle may pave the way towards more exotic correlated
systems, such as unconventional superconductors or quantum spin liquids.

research due to the surge in high-dimensional datasets in all areas of modern
life. A plethora of feature selection algorithms have been proposed, but it is
difficult to truly analyse the quality of a given algorithm. Ideally, an
algorithm would be evaluated by measuring how well it removes known bad
features. Acquiring datasets with such features is inherently difficult, and so
a common technique is to add synthetic bad features to an existing dataset.
While adding noisy features is an easy task, it is very difficult to
automatically add complex, redundant features. This work proposes one of the
first approaches to generating redundant features, using a novel genetic
programming approach. Initial experiments show that our proposed method can
automatically create difficult, redundant features which have the potential to
be used for creating high-quality feature selection benchmark datasets.

Dirichlet prior distribution. The standard approach towards approximating the
posterior is to use variational inference algorithms, and in particular a mean
field approximation.
  We show that this approach suffers from an instability that can produce
misleading conclusions. Namely, for certain regimes of the model parameters,
variational inference outputs a non-trivial decomposition into topics. However
--for the same parameter values-- the data contain no actual information about
the true decomposition, and hence the output of the algorithm is uncorrelated
with the true topic decomposition. Among other consequences, the estimated
posterior mean is significantly wrong, and estimated Bayesian credible regions
do not achieve the nominal coverage. We discuss how this instability is
remedied by more accurate mean field approximations.

lead to a shortly lived hypermassive NS or directly produce a black hole (BH).
There is no clear evidence to support or rule out a long-lived NS as the merger
remnant. Here we utilize the GW and electromagnetic (EM) signals to
comprehensively investigate the parameter space that allows a long-lived NS to
survive as the merger remnant of GW170817. We find that for some stiff
equations of state, the merger of GW170817 could, in principle, lead to a
massive NS, which has a millisecond spin period. The post-merger GW signal
could hardly constrain the ellipticity of the NS. If the ellipticity reaches
$10^{-3}$, in order to be compatible with the multi-band EM observations, the
dipole magnetic field of the NS ($B_p$) is constrained to the magnetar level of
$\sim10^{14}$ G. If the ellipticity is smaller than $10^{-4}$, $B_p$ is
constrained to the level of $\sim10^{10}-10^{12}\,$G. These conclusions weakly
depend on the adoption of equations of state.

Specifically, we assume that the attacker knows the architecture of the

analyst designs the detector by relying on a subset of features chosen at

attacks a version of the detector based on the entire feature set. In this way,
the effectiveness of the attack diminishes since there is no guarantee that
attacking a detector working in the full feature space will result in a
successful attack against the reduced-feature detector. We theoretically prove
that, thanks to random feature selection, the security of the detector
increases significantly at the expense of a negligible loss of performance in
the absence of attacks. We also provide an experimental validation of the
proposed procedure by focusing on the detection of two specific kinds of image
manipulations, namely adaptive histogram equalization and median filtering. The
experiments confirm the gain in security at the expense of a negligible loss of
performance in the absence of attacks.

time evolving networks. Many real-life influence graphs such as social
networks, telephone networks, and IP traffic data exhibit dynamic
characteristics, e.g., the underlying structure and communication patterns
evolve with time. Correspondingly, we develop a dynamic framework for the
influence maximization problem, where we perform effective local updates to
quickly adjust the top-k influencers, as the structure and communication
patterns in the network change. We design a novel N-Family approach (N=1, 2, 3,
...) based on the maximum influence arborescence (MIA) propagation model with
approximation guarantee of (1-1/e). We then develop heuristic algorithms by
extending the N-Family approach to other information propagation models (e.g.,
independent cascade, linear threshold) and influence maximization algorithms
(e.g., CELF, reverse reachable sketch). Based on a detailed empirical analysis
over several real-world, dynamic, and large-scale networks, we find that our
proposed solution, N-Family improves the updating time of the top-k influencers
by 1-2 orders of magnitude, compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, while
ensuring similar memory usage and influence spreads.

Australia. However security and privacy of the MHR system have been encumbering
the development of the system. Even though the MHR system is claimed as
patient-cenred and patient-controlled, there are several instances where
healthcare providers (other than the usual provider) and system operators who
maintain the system can easily access the system and these unauthorised
accesses can lead to a breach of the privacy of the patients. This is one of
the main concerns of the consumers that affect the uptake of the system. In
this paper, we propose a patient centred MHR framework which requests
authorisation from the patient to access their sensitive health information.
The proposed model increases the involvement and satisfaction of the patients
in their healthcare and also suggests mobile security system to give an online
permission to access the MHR system.

have proposed construction methods based on multiple kernels of different
dimensions, not only binary ones, allowing code lengths different from powers
of $2$. In this work, we design and implement the first multi-kernel successive
cancellation polar code decoder in literature. It can decode any code
constructed with binary and ternary kernels: the architecture, sized for a
maximum code length $N_{max}$, is fully flexible in terms of code length, code
rate and kernel sequence. The decoder can achieve frequency of more than $1$
GHz in $65$ nm CMOS technology, and a throughput of $615$ Mb/s. The area
occupation ranges between $0.11$ mm$^2$ for $N_{max}=256$ and $2.01$ mm$^2$ for

porous locally periodic materials saturated by viscous fluids. At the
macroscopic level, the porous material is described by the Biot model defined
in terms of the effective medium coefficients, involving the drained skeleton
elasticity, the Biot stress coupling, the Biot compressibility coefficients,
and by the hydraulic permeability of the Darcy flow model. By virtue of the
homogenization, these coefficients are computed using characteristic responses
of the representative unit cell consisting of an elastic solid skeleton and a
viscous pore fluid. For the purpose of optimization, the sensitivity analysis
on the continuous level of the problem is derived. We provide sensitivities of
objective functions constituted by the Biot model coefficients with respect to
the underlying pore shape described by a B-spline box which embeds the whole
representative cell. We consider material design problems in the framework of
which the layout of a single representative cell is optimized. Then we propose
a sequential linearization approach to the two-scale problem in which local
microstructures are optimized with respect to macroscopic design criteria.
Numerical experiments are reported which include stiffness maximization with
constraints allowing for a sufficient permeability, and vice versa. Issues of
the design anisotropy, the spline box parametrization are discussed. In order
to avoid remeshing a geometric regularization technique based on injectivity
constraints is applied.

scattering, for the first time for kaons carrying a large fraction $z$ of the
virtual-photon energy. The data were obtained by the COMPASS collaboration
using a 160 GeV muon beam and an isoscalar $^6$LiD target. The regime of
deep-inelastic scattering is ensured by requiring $Q^2>1$ (GeV/$c)^2$ for the
photon virtuality and $W>5$ GeV/$c^2$ for the invariant mass of the produced
hadronic system. Kaons are identified in the momentum range from 12 GeV/$c$ to
40 GeV/$c$, thereby restricting the range in Bjorken-$x$ to $0.01<x<0.40$. The
$z$-dependence of the multiplicity ratio is studied for $z>0.75$. For very
large values of $z$, $i.e.$ $z>0.8$, we observe the kaon multiplicity ratio to
fall below the lower limits expected from calculations based on leading and
next-to-leading order perturbative quantum chromodynamics. Also, the kaon
multiplicity ratio shows a strong dependence on the missing mass of the
single-kaon production process. This suggests that within the perturbative
quantum chromodynamics formalism an additional correction may be required,
which takes into account the phase space available for hadronisation.

for unsafe languages, expressing end-to-end security guarantees for software
components that may become compromised after encountering undefined
behavior---for example, by accessing an array out of bounds.
  Our criterion is the first to model dynamic compromise in a system of
mutually distrustful components with clearly specified privileges. It
articulates how each component should be protected from all the others---in
particular, from components that have encountered undefined behavior and become
compromised. Each component receives secure compilation guarantees---in
particular, its internal invariants are protected from compromised
components---up to the point when this component itself becomes compromised,
after which we assume an attacker can take complete control and use this
component's privileges to attack other components. More precisely, a secure
compilation chain must ensure that a dynamically compromised component cannot
break the safety properties of the system at the target level any more than an
arbitrary attacker-controlled component (with the same interface and
privileges, but without undefined behaviors) already could at the source level.
  To illustrate the model, we construct a secure compilation chain for a small
unsafe language with buffers, procedures, and components, targeting a simple
abstract machine with built-in compartmentalization. We give a machine-checked
proof in Coq that this compiler satisfies our secure compilation criterion.
Finally, we show that the protection guarantees offered by the
compartmentalized abstract machine can be achieved at the machine-code level
using either software fault isolation or a tag-based reference monitor.

correlations with clusters (Type 3), and clusters with no associated clumps
(Type 4). Analyses of the velocity structures and the chemical compositions
imply that the clump + cluster systems should evolve from Type 1 to Type 4. We
found that some of the Type 2 clumps are infalling on the clump-scale to form
clusters at the clump center, which should commonly occur in the beginning of
cluster formation. Interestingly, all of the identified Type 1 clumps are
likely to be older than the Type 2 clumps in terms of chemical compositions,

formidable obstacle for developing silicene-based materials and devices for

substrate will result in a phase transition from topological nontrivial phase
to trivial phase of silicene, although its Dirac cone is still obvious. The
substrate effect (equivalent to an electric field) annihilates its spin-orbit
coupling effect, the reason why its quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) of silicene

seems impossible to recover the QSHE due to the screen effect of substrate. We
here first propose a viable strategy (constructing inverse symmetrical sandwich

interpolation to both avoid overfitting of the data and to recover a sparse

for approximating smooth, multivariate functions defined on irregular domains
in $d$ dimensions, where $d$ can be arbitrary. This method is simple, and
relies only on orthogonal polynomials on a bounding tensor-product domain. In
particular, the domain of the function need not be known in advance. When
restricted to a subdomain, an orthonormal basis is no longer a basis, but a
frame. Numerical computations with frames present potential difficulties, due
to the near-linear dependence of the truncated approximation system.
Nevertheless, well-conditioned approximations can be obtained via
regularization, for instance, truncated singular value decompositions. We
comprehensively analyze such approximations in this paper, providing error
estimates for functions with both classical and mixed Sobolev regularity, with
the latter being particularly suitable for higher-dimensional problems. We also
analyze the sample complexity of the approximation for sample points chosen
randomly according to a probability measure, providing estimates in terms of
the corresponding \textit{Nikolskii inequality} for the domain. In particular,
we show that the sample complexity for points drawn from the uniform measure is
quadratic (up to a log factor) in the dimension of the polynomial space,
independently of $d$, for a large class of nontrivial domains. This extends a

performs on par with a system trained with a mean square error cost applied to
short-time temporal envelopes. Finally, we show that the proposed SE system
performs on par with a traditional DNN based Short-Time Spectral Amplitude

are important because they suggest that traditional DNN based STSA SE systems

several unusual optomechanical effects have been unveiled when subtle
spin-orbit interactions come at play to build up optical forces and torques
that are hardly seen in everyday life, such as negative optical radiation
pressure, transverse optical forces, or left-handed optical torques. To date,
there are only a few experimental proposals to reveal these effects despite
tremendous conceptual advances. In particular, spin-dependent lateral forces
and their angular analog are done either at the expense of direct observations
or at the cost of specific instrumental complexity. Here we report on naked-eye
identification of light-induced spin-dependent lateral displacements of
centimeter-sized objects endowed with structured birefringence. Its angular
counterpart is also discussed and the observation of left-handed macroscopic
rotational motion is reported. The unveiled effects are ultimately driven by
lateral optical force fields that are five orders of magnitude larger than
those reported so far. These results allow structured light-matter interaction
to move from a scientific curiosity to a new asset for the existing
multidisciplinary optical manipulation toolbox across length scales. In
addition, this highlights the spin-orbit optomechanics of anisotropic and
inhomogeneous media, which is just beginning to be explored.

dimension $4$. These are seemingly the first such examples which are not
locally homogeneous. Our metrics are carried by a sequence of 4-manifolds
$(X_k)$ previously considered by Gromov and Thurston. The construction begins
with a certain sequence $(M_k)$ of hyperbolic 4-manifolds, each containing a
totally geodesic surface $\Sigma_k$ which is nullhomologous and whose normal
injectivity radius tends to infinity with $k$. For a fixed choice of natural
number $l$, we consider the $l$-fold cover $X_k \to M_k$ branched along
$\Sigma_k$. We prove that for any choice of $l$ and all large enough $k$
(depending on $l$), $X_k$ carries an Einstein metric of negative sectional
curvature. The first step in the proof is to find an approximate Einstein
metric on $X_k$, which is done by interpolating between a model Einstein metric
near the branch locus and the pull-back of the hyperbolic metric from $M_k$.
The second step in the proof is to perturb this to a genuine solution to
Einstein's equations, by a parameter dependent version of the inverse function
theorem. The analysis relies on a delicate bootstrap procedure based on $L^2$

data sets emanating from cyber physical systems (CPS). The definition of CPS
most pertinent to this paper is: A CPS is a system with a coupling of the cyber
aspects of computing and communications with the physical aspects of dynamics
and engineering that must abide by the laws of physics. This includes sensor
networks, real-time and hybrid systems. To ensure that the computation results
conform to the laws of physics a linear differential operator (LDO) is embedded
in the processing channel for each sensor. In this manner the dynamics of the
system can be incorporated prior to performing symbolic analysis. A non-linear
quantization is used for the intervals corresponding to the symbols. The
intervals are based on observed modes of the system, which can be determined
either during an exploratory phase or online during operation of the system. A
complete processing channel is called a single channel lexical analyser; one is
made available for each sensor on the machine being observed. The
implementation of LDO in the system is particularly important since it enables
the establishment of a causal link between the observations of the dynamic
system and their cause. Without causality there can be no semantics and without
semantics no knowledge acquisition based on the physical background of the
system being observed. Correlation alone is not a guarantee for causality. This
work was originally motivated from the observation of large bulk mate- rial
handling systems. Typically, there are $n = 150\dots250$ sensors per machine,
and data is collected in a multi rate manner; whereby general sensors are
sampled with $f_s = 1Hz$ and vibration data being sampled in the kilo-hertz
range.

cases, DMLC plans Pareto optimal to the MCO formulation with the proposed
objective functions are generated. Evaluated based on pre-defined plan quality
indices, these DMLC plans are compared to conventionally generated DMLC plans.
Comparable or superior plan quality is observed. Supported by these results,
the proposed objective functions are argued to have a potential to streamline
the planning process, since they are designed to overcome the methodological
shortcomings associated with the conventional penalty-based objective functions
assumed to cause the current need for time-consuming trial-and-error parameter
tuning. In particular, the increased accuracy of the planning tools imposed by

sensor and actor data of bulk materials handling plants and machinery. It
references issues that concern mining sensor data in cyber physical systems
(CPS). The advance of cyber physical systems has created a significant change
in the architecture of sensor and actor data. It affects the complexity of the
observed systems in general, the number of signals being processed, the spatial
distribution of the signal sources on a machine or plant and the global
availability of the data. There are different definitions for what constitutes
cyber physical systems: the most succinct and pertinent to the work shown in
this paper is the definition given by the IEEE: A CPS is a system with a
coupling of the cyber aspects of computing and communications with the physical
aspects of dynamics and engineering that must abide by the laws of physics.
This includes sensor networks, real-time and hybrid systems. Results computed
from sensor and actor data must obey the equations used for modelling the
physics of the observed system - this fundamentally poses an inverse problem.
Such problems are not covered sufficiently by literature addressing mining of
sensor data. Even available standard books on mining sensor data do not discuss
the special nature of sensor data. Typically, present approaches of mining data
rely on correlation as being a sole, reliable measure for significance. It is
not taken into account that the inverse solutions to the model-describing
equations are required to establish a semantic link between a sensor
observation and its precedent cause. Without this link - without causality -
there can be no physics based knowledge discovery.

achieved where the emitter resonance broadens to a significant fraction of its
frequency. In this work we gain significantly improved control over this
regime. We do so by combining the simplicity of a transmon qubit and a bespoke
EM environment with a high density of discrete modes, hosted inside a
superconducting metamaterial. This produces a unique device in which the
hybridisation between the qubit and up to 10 environmental modes can be
monitored directly. Moreover the frequency and broadening of the qubit
resonance can be tuned independently of each other in situ. We experimentally
demonstrate that our device combines this tunability with ultrastrong coupling
and a qubit nonlinearity comparable to the other relevant energy scales in the
system. We also develop a quantitative theoretical description that does not
contain any phenomenological parameters and that accurately takes into account
vacuum fluctuations of our large scale quantum circuit in the regime of
ultrastrong coupling and intermediate non-linearity. The demonstration of this
new platform combined with a quantitative modelling brings closer the prospect
of experimentally studying many-body effects in quantum optics. A limitation of
the current device is the intermediate nonlinearity of the qubit. Pushing it
further will induce fully developed many-body effects, such as a giant Lamb
shift or nonclassical states of multimode optical fields. Observing such
effects would establish interesting links between quantum optics and the
physics of quantum impurities.

the SMC algorithm to establish a stable closed-loop system, where the stability

implication of an auxiliary robustifying control term. In addition, the
implementation of the multivariate Gaussian function helps the controller to
handle the non-axis parallel data from the plant and consequently enhances the
robustness against the uncertainties and environmental perturbations. Finally,
the controller performance has been evaluated by observing the tracking

searches - mostly focused on a class of theoretically well-motivated DM
candidates such as the weakly-interacting massive particles - are affected by a
complex astrophysical background of cosmic radiation. The understanding and
modeling of such background requires a deep comprehension of an intricate
classical plasma physics problem, i.e. the interaction between high-energy
charged particles, accelerated in peculiar astrophysical environments, and
magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence in the interstellar medium of our Galaxy. In
this review we highlight several aspects of this exciting interplay between the

imaging modality which makes use of diffuse light propagation in random media.
When optical properties of a random medium is investigated from boundary
measurements of reflected or transmitted light, iterative inversion schemes
such as the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm are known to fail when initial
guesses are not close to the true value of the coefficient to be reconstructed.
In this paper, we investigate how this weakness of iterative schemes is
overcome by the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo. Using time-resolved
measurements performed against a polyurethane-based phantom, we present a case
that the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm fails to work but the proposed hybrid
method works well. Then with a toy model of diffuse optical tomography we
illustrate that the evenberg-Marquardt method fails when it is trapped by a
local minimum but the hybrid method can escape from local minima by using the
Metropolis-Hastings Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm until it reaches the
valley of the global minimum. The proposed hybrid scheme can be applied to
different inverse problems in NIRS which are solved iteratively. We find that
for both numerical and phantom experiments optical properties such as the
absorption and reduced scattering coefficients can be retrieved without being
trapped by a local minimum when Monte Carlo simulation is run only about $100$
steps before switching to an iterative method. The hybrid method is compared
with simulated annealing. Although the Metropolis-Hastings MCMC arrives at the
steady state at about $10000$ Monte Carlo steps, in the hybrid method the Monte
Carlo simulation can be stopped way before the burn-in time.

Stratonovich stochastic integrals of fifth and sixth multiplicities based on
the method of generalized multiple Fourier series converging in the sense of
norm in Hilbert space $L_2([t, T]^k),$ $k\in\mathbb{N}.$ Specifically, we use
multiple Fourier-Legendre series and multiple trigonometric Fourier series.
Expansions of iterated Sratonovich stochastic integrals of multiplicities 1-4
were obtained in previous works of the author. The considered expansions
converges in the mean-square sense and contain only one operation of the limit
transition in contrast to its existing analogues. Expansions of iterated
Stratonovich stochastic integrals turned out much simpler than appropriate
expansions of iterated Ito stochastic integrals. We use expansions of the
latter as a tool of the proof of expansions for iterated Stratonovich
stochastic integrals. Iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals are the part
of the Taylor-Stratonovich expansion of solutions of Ito stochastic
differential equations. That is why the results of the article can be applied
to the numerical integrations of Ito stochastic differential equations.

constant temperature covering both the liquid and crystalline phase by
molecular dynamics simulation. We identify three distinct structural classes of
particles by examining the immediate neighborhood of individual particles based
on a solid-angle based tessellation technique. In particular, the area
distribution of the neighborhoods reveals cages having hexagonal, pentagonal
and square symmetries. Pentagonal cells appear to be predominant motif in the
liquid phase, while the solid phase is dominated by hexagonal cells, as in the
case of the perfect crystal. Examining the spatial organization of particles
belonging to each structural class separately shows that finite-size clusters
formed by particles of hexagonal and pentagonal population found within liquids
and solids, respectively, grow in a complementary way as a function of density
and both particle populations percolate within liquid-crystal coexistence
regime. Interestingly, the populations of particles with different local
structures, defined by the arrangement of neighboring particles, are found to
maintain different diffusivity computed from the velocity autocorrelation of
constituent particles for all densities studied. Our analysis provides a new
approach for analyzing and a possible framework for understanding the
structural changes in soft materials.

spin and parity corresponding to a known nearby resonance. The new calculation
improves significantly the agreement with line shape data compared to previous

problem, where the multiplication table is not required to be associative, is
P-complete. For groups, the problem can be solved in deterministic log-space

Barrington, Kadau, Lange and McKenzie showed that for Abelian groups and for
certain solvable groups, the problem is contained in the complexity class FOLL
and they concluded that these variants are not hard for any complexity class
containing PARITY. The more general case of arbitrary groups remained open. In

  Learning","22 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the core tasks in multi-view learning is to capture relations among
views. For sequential data, the relations not only span across views, but also
extend throughout the view length to form long-term intra-view and inter-view
interactions. In this paper, we present a new memory augmented neural network
model that aims to model these complex interactions between two asynchronous
sequential views. Our model uses two encoders for reading from and writing to
two external memories for encoding input views. The intra-view interactions and
the long-term dependencies are captured by the use of memories during this
encoding process. There are two modes of memory accessing in our system:
late-fusion and early-fusion, corresponding to late and early inter-view
interactions. In the late-fusion mode, the two memories are separated,
containing only view-specific contents. In the early-fusion mode, the two
memories share the same addressing space, allowing cross-memory accessing. In
both cases, the knowledge from the memories will be combined by a decoder to
make predictions over the output space. The resulting dual memory neural
computer is demonstrated on a comprehensive set of experiments, including a
synthetic task of summing two sequences and the tasks of drug prescription and
disease progression in healthcare. The results demonstrate competitive
performance over both traditional algorithms and deep learning methods designed
for multi-view problems.

The collision processes are associated to the quantum collapse of the local

  its application to medical cost data","16 pages, 2 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a novel approach to estimate the Cox model with temporal
covariates. Our new approach treats the temporal covariates as arising from a
longitudinal process which is modeled jointly with the event time. Different
from the literature, the longitudinal process in our model is specified as a
bounded variational process and determined by a family of Initial Value
Problems associated with an Ordinary Differential Equation. Our specification
has the advantage that only the observation of the temporal covariates at the
time to event and the time to event itself are required to fit the model, while
it is fine but not necessary to have more longitudinal observations. This fact
makes our approach very useful for many medical outcome datasets, like the New
York State Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System and the National
Inpatient Sample, where it is important to find the hazard rate of being
discharged given the accumulative cost but only the total cost at the discharge
time is available due to the protection of patient information. Our estimation
procedure is based on maximizing the full information likelihood function. The
resulting estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normally
distributed. Variable selection techniques, like Adaptive LASSO, can be easily
modified and incorporated into our estimation procedure. The oracle property is
verified for the resulting estimator of the regression coefficients.
Simulations and a real example illustrate the practical utility of the proposed
model. Finally, a couple of potential extensions of our approach are discussed.

non-secular time scales (from seconds to years) the effect of dynamical
processes such as convection, rotation, and magnetic fields can modify the
stellar oscillations. Convection excites acoustic modes in solar-like stars,
while rotation and magnetic fields can perturb the oscillation frequencies
lifting the degeneracy in the azimuthal component m of the eigenfrequencies.
Moreover, the interaction between rotation, convection, and magnetic fields can
produce magnetic dynamos, which sometimes yield to regular magnetic activity
cycles. In this chapter we review how stellar dynamics can be studied and
explain what long-term seismic observations can bring to the understanding of
this field. Thus, we show how we can study some properties of the convective
time scales operating in a star like the Sun. We also compare the stratified
information we can obtain on the internal (radial) differential rotation from
main sequence solar-like stars, to the Sun, and to more evolved sub giants, and
giants. We complement this information on the internal rotation with the
determination of the surface (latitudinal differential) rotation obtained
directly from the light curves. Indeed, when stars are active there can be
spots on their surfaces dimming the light emitted. When the star rotates, the
emitted light will be modulated by the presence of these spots with a period
corresponding to the rotation rate at the active latitudes (where the spots
develop). We conclude this chapter by discussing the seismology of fast
rotating stars and, from a theoretical point of view, what are the current
challenges to infer properties of the internal structure and dynamics of
intermediate- and high-mass stars.

sinus arrhythmia are widely used in research and clinical applications.
Inspired by the ideas from the theory of coupled oscillators, we use
simultaneous measurements of respiratory and cardiac activity to perform a
nonlinear decomposition of the heart rate variability into the
respiratory-related component and the rest. We suggest to exploit the technique
as a universal preprocessing tool, both for the analysis of respiratory
influence on the heart rate as well as in cases when effects of other factors
on the heart rate variability are in focus. The theoretical consideration is

  Estimation Problem",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider a multi-sensor estimation problem wherein each
sensor collects noisy information about its local process, which is only
observed by that sensor, and a common process, which is simultaneously observed
by all sensors. The objective is to assess the privacy level of (the local
process of) each sensor while the common process is estimated using cloud
computing technology. The privacy level of a sensor is defined as the
conditional entropy of its local process given the shared information with the
cloud. Two information sharing schemes are considered: a local scheme, and a
global scheme. Under the local scheme, each sensor estimates the common process
based on its the measurement and transmits its estimate to a cloud. Under the
global scheme, the cloud receives the sum of sensors' measurements. It is shown
that, in the local scheme, the privacy level of each sensor is always above a
certain level which is characterized using Shannon's mutual information. It is
also proved that this result becomes tight as the number of sensors increases.
We also show that the global scheme is asymptotically private, i.e., the
privacy loss of the global scheme decreases to zero at the rate of O(1/M) where
M is the number of sensors.

stabilization is achieved. Further, the results from the Haines jump case are
consistent with experimental observations. A performance analysis reveals that
the semi-implicit method is able to perform stable simulations with much less
computational effort than the explicit methods at low capillary numbers. The
relative benefit of using the semi-implicit method increases with decreasing
capillary number $\mathrm{Ca}$, and at $\mathrm{Ca} \sim 10^{-8}$ the
computational time needed is reduced by three orders of magnitude. This
increased efficiency enables simulations in the low-capillary number regime
that are unfeasible with explicit methods and the range of capillary numbers
for which the pore network model is a tractable modeling alternative is thus
greatly extended by the semi-implicit method.

  Stores",,,,,"cs.DB cs.OS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces the concept of size-aware sharding to improve tail
latencies for in-memory key-value stores, and describes its implementation in
the Minos key-value store. Tail latencies are crucial in distributed
applications with high fan-out ratios, because overall response time is
determined by the slowest response. Size-aware sharding distributes requests
for keys to cores according to the size of the item associated with the key. In
particular, requests for small and large items are sent to disjoint subsets of
cores. Size-aware sharding improves tail latencies by avoiding head-of-line
blocking, in which a request for a small item gets queued behind a request for
a large item. Alternative size-unaware approaches to sharding, such as
keyhash-based sharding, request dispatching and stealing do not avoid
head-of-line blocking, and therefore exhibit worse tail latencies. The
challenge in implementing size-aware sharding is to maintain high throughput by
avoiding the cost of software dispatching and by achieving load balancing
between different cores. Minos uses hardware dispatch for all requests for
small items, which form the very large majority of all requests. It achieves
load balancing by adapting the number of cores handling requests for small and
large items to their relative presence in the workload. We compare Minos to
three state-of-the-art designs of in-memory KV stores. Compared to its closest
competitor, Minos achieves a 99th percentile latency that is up to two orders
of magnitude lower. Put differently, for a given value for the 99th percentile
latency equal to 10 times the mean service time, Minos achieves a throughput
that is up to 7.4 times higher.

The results can be correctly explained by analyzing the relevant

the basis of experimental data that the entropy of the posterior is minimized

also address several related combinatorial problems. We present an algorithm

we consider supersequences that contain a single embedding of a fixed
subsequence, referred to as singletons, and provide a closed form expression
for enumerating them using the same run-length encoding. We prove an analogous
result for the minimization and maximization of the number of singletons, by
the alternating and the uniform strings, respectively. Next, we prove the
original minimal entropy conjecture for the special cases of single and double

3.5 um. Here, we fabricated a 3.5-um saturable absorber mirror (SAM) by
transferring liquid-phase exfoliated BP flakes onto a gold-coated mirror. With
the as-prepared BP SAM, we realized stable Q-switching and continuous-wave
mode-locking operations in the DWP Er:ZBLAN fiber lasers at 3.5 um. To the best
of our knowledge, it is the first time to achieve passively Q-switched and
mode-locked pulses in 3.5 um spectral region. The research results will not
only promote the development of 3.5-um pulsed fiber lasers but also open the
photonic application of two-dimensional materials in this spectral region

analytical halo model from which the scale dependence of
$\Gamma_{\text{gm}}(r_{\text{p}})$, and the origin of the non-linearity and

unveil the physical reason for the non-linearity and stochasticity, further
explored using hydrodynamical simulations, with the stochasticity mostly
originating from the non-Poissonian behaviour of satellite galaxies in the dark
matter haloes and their spatial distribution, which does not follow the spatial
distribution of dark matter in the halo. The observed non-linearity is mostly
due to the presence of the central galaxies, as was noted from previous
theoretical work on the same topic. We also see that overall, more massive
galaxies reveal a stronger scale dependence, and out to a larger radius. Our

change of the transverse trapping frequency in an elongated Bose-Einstein

times, we observe an exponential growth of the number of resonant longitudinal
phonons, in agreement with the predictions of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes
treatment. We then observe an ordered sequence of phenomena induced by the
nonlinearities of the system. The first is a loss of the nonseparability of the
resonant phonon pairs. This is followed by the saturation of the exponential
growth and a strong depletion of condensed atoms. Notably, these effects are
well-described by effective 1D dynamics, and are hardly affected by the damping
of the radial oscillations. Finally, the atomic spectrum becomes broad,
featureless and almost incoherent, in agreement with experimental results. The
link between this sequence of events and the preheating scenario in
inflationary cosmology is striking, as is the similarity of techniques used to
study them.

detected in this cluster and its X-ray spectrum can be fitted with the
combination of a soft, neutron-star atmosphere model and a hard, power-law

(~4.8X10^33 erg/s). This type of X-ray spectrum is typically observed for
quiescent neutron-star X-ray transients that are perhaps accreting in
quiescence at very low rates. Therefore, if this X-ray source is the quiescent
counterpart of GRS 1747-312, then this source is also accreting at low levels
in-between outbursts. Since source confusion a likely problem in globular
clusters, it is quite possible that part, if not all, of the emission we
observed is not related to GRS 1747-312, and is instead associated with another
source or conglomeration of sources in the cluster. Currently, it is not
possible to determine exactly which part of the emission truly originates from
GRS 1747-312, and a Chandra observation (when no source is in outburst in

due to GRS 1747-312, we discuss the observed results in the context of what is
known about other quiescent systems. We also investigated the thermal evolution
of the neutron star in GRS 1747-312, and inferred that GRS 1747-312 can be

energy density distribution function. An analytical form of the survival
amplitude $a(t)$ of the state considered is found. Our attention is focused on
the late time properties of $a(t)$ and on effects generated by the
non--exponential behavior of this amplitude in the late time region: In 1957
Khalfin proved that this amplitude tends to zero as $t$ goes to the infinity
more slowly than any exponential function of $t$. This effect can be described
using a time-dependent decay rate $\gamma(t)$ and then the Khalfin result means
that this $\gamma(t)$ is not a constant but at late times it tends to zero as
$t$ goes to the infinity. It appears that the energy $E(t)$ of the unstable
state behaves similarly: It tends to the minimal energy $E_{min}$ of the system
as $t \to \infty$. Within the model considered we find two first leading time
dependent elements of late time asymptotic expansions of $E(t)$ and $\gamma
(t)$. We discuss also possible implications of such a late time asymptotic

show that double neutron star mergers could lead to rich and bright EM

star/black hole (NS-NS/BH) mergers would leave behind a central remnant
surrounded by a mildly isotropic ejecta. The central remnant could launch a
collimated jet and when the jet propagating through the ejecta, a mildly
relativistic cocoon would be formed and the interaction between the cocoon and
the ambient medium would accelerate electrons via external shock in a wide
angle. So that the merger-nova photons (i.e., thermal emission from the ejecta)
would be scattered into higher frequency via inverse compton (IC) process when
they propagating through the cocoon shocked region. We find that the IC
scattered component peaks at X-ray band and it will reach its peak luminosity
in order of days (simultaneously with the merger-nova emission). With current
X-ray detectors, such a late X-ray component could be detected out to 200 Mpc,
depending on the merger remnant properties. It could serve as an important
electromagnetic counterpart of gravitational wave signals from NS-NS/BH
mergers. Nevertheless, simultaneous detection of such a late X-ray signal and
the merger-nova signal could shed light on the cocoon properties and the
concrete structure of the jet.

efficiently compressed by standard codec, as compared to the input image.
Furthermore, we use post-processing neural network (PPNN) to remove the coding
artifacts caused by quantization of codec. Secondly, low-resolution image
representation is adopted for high efficiency compression in terms of most of
bit spent by image's structures under low bit-rate. However, more bits should
be assigned to image details in the high-resolution, when most of structures
have been kept after compression at the high bit-rate. This comes from a fact
that the low-resolution image representation can't burden more information than
high-resolution representation beyond a certain bit-rate. Finally, to resolve
the problem of error back-propagation from the PPNN network to the FDNN
network, we introduce to learn a virtual codec neural network to imitate two
continuous procedures of standard compression and post-processing. The

Perturbations and Madry. On an average, AMC increases the model's empirical
robustness against various attacks simultaneously, by a significant margin (of
6.225% for MNIST, 5.075% for SVHN and 2.65% for CIFAR10). At the same time, the

Spencer sequence in the framework of the formal theory of Lie pseudogroups and
to introduce it for the conformal group of space-time with 15 parameters. Then,
all the previous explicit couplings can be deduced abstractly and one must just
go to a laboratory in order to know about the coupling constants on which they

results demonstrate the ability of data lake to reduce the time for ingesting
data from various data vendors regardless of its format. Moreover, it is
evident that the data lake poses the potential to generate clusters of patients
more precisely than the existing approaches. It is obvious that the data lake
provides a unified storage location for the data in its native format. It can
also improve the personalized healthcare medication recommendations by removing
the data silos.

  Shakkottai","On Learning the $c\mu$ Rule in Single and Parallel Server Networks",,,,,"cs.PF math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider learning-based variants of the $c \mu$ rule for scheduling in
single and parallel server settings of multi-class queueing systems.
  In the single server setting, the $c \mu$ rule is known to minimize the
expected holding-cost (weighted queue-lengths summed over classes and a fixed
time horizon). We focus on the problem where the service rates $\mu$ are
unknown with the holding-cost regret (regret against the $c \mu$ rule with
known $\mu$) as our objective. We show that the greedy algorithm that uses
empirically learned service rates results in a constant holding-cost regret
(the regret is independent of the time horizon). This free exploration can be
explained in the single server setting by the fact that any work-conserving
policy obtains the same number of samples in a busy cycle.
  In the parallel server setting, we show that the $c \mu$ rule may result in
unstable queues, even for arrival rates within the capacity region. We then
present sufficient conditions for geometric ergodicity under the $c \mu$ rule.
Using these results, we propose an almost greedy algorithm that explores only
when the number of samples falls below a threshold. We show that this algorithm
delivers constant holding-cost regret because a free exploration condition is
eventually satisfied.
