a sharp transition between the crystalline and non-crystalline phase as a
function of the Stokes number. Furthermore, the nature of preferential

correlation dimension $D_2$, is significantly different from that of
particle-laden flows in the absence of repulsive potentials.

Demand (VoD) has made the data transmission from content delivery networks

extension to CDN networks to alleviate this excessive data transfer through
caching and to delegate the computation tasks to edge servers. To maximize the
caching efficiency in the edge networks, different Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)
servers assist each others to effectively select which content to store and the
appropriate computation tasks to process. In this paper, we adopt a
collaborative caching and transcoding model for VoD in MEC networks. However,
unlike other models in the literature, different chunks of the same video are
not fetched and cached in the same MEC server. Instead, neighboring servers
will collaborate to store and transcode different video chunks and consequently
optimize the limited resources usage. Since we are dealing with chunks caching
and processing, we propose to maximize the edge efficiency by studying the
viewers watching pattern and designing a probabilistic model where chunks
popularities are evaluated. Based on this model, popularity-aware policies,
namely Proactive caching policy (PcP) and Cache replacement Policy (CrP), are
introduced to cache only highest probably requested chunks. In addition to PcP
and CrP, an online algorithm (PCCP) is proposed to schedule the collaborative
caching and processing. The evaluation results prove that our model and
policies give better performance than approaches using conventional replacement
policies. This improvement reaches up to 50% in some cases.

(EWSB), the triplet scalar gets an induced vacuum expectation value (vev),
which yield Majorana masses not only to the light neutrinos but also to
vector-like leptonic doublet DM. Due to the Majorana mass of DM, the $Z$

of which Medicanes, is studied evaluating ECMWF operational ensemble forecasts
against operational analysis data. Forecast cyclone trajectories are compared
to the cyclone trajectory in the analysis by means of a dynamic time warping
technique, which allows to find a match in terms of their overall
spatio-temporal similarity. Each storm is treated as an object and its
forecasts are analysed using metrics that describe intensity, symmetry,
compactness, and upper-level thermal structure. This object-based approach
allows to focus on specific storm features, while tolerating their shifts in
time and space to some extent. The compactness and symmetry of the storms are
generally underpredicted, especially at long lead times. However, forecast
accuracy tends to strongly improve at short lead times, indicating that the
ECMWF ensemble forecast model can adequately reproduce Medicanes, albeit only
few days in advance. In particular, late forecasts which have been initialised
when the cyclone has already developed are distinctly more accurate than
earlier forecasts in predicting its kinematic and thermal structure, confirming
previous findings of high sensitivity of Medicane simulations to initial
conditions. Findings reveal a markedly non-gradual evolution of ensemble
forecasts with lead time. Specifically, a rapid increase in the probability of
cyclone occurrence (""forecast jump"") is seen in most cases, generally between 5
and 7 days lead time. Jumps are also found for ensemble median and/or spread
for storm thermal structure forecasts. This behaviour is compatible with the
existence of predictability barriers. On the other hand, storm position
forecasts often exhibit a consistent spatial distribution of storm position
uncertainty and bias between consecutive forecasts.

  Model",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Higher-order motif structures and multi-vertex interactions are becoming
increasingly important in studies that aim to improve our understanding of
functionalities and evolution patterns of networks. To elucidate the role of
higher-order structures in community detection problems over complex networks,
we introduce the notion of a Superimposed Stochastic Block Model (SupSBM). The
model is based on a random graph framework in which certain higher-order
structures or subgraphs are generated through an independent hyperedge
generation process, and are then replaced with graphs that are superimposed
with directed or undirected edges generated by an inhomogeneous random graph
model. Consequently, the model introduces controlled dependencies between edges
which allow for capturing more realistic network phenomena, namely strong local
clustering in a sparse network, short average path length, and community
structure. We proceed to rigorously analyze the performance of a number of
recently proposed higher-order spectral clustering methods on the SupSBM. In
particular, we prove non-asymptotic upper bounds on the misclustering error of
spectral community detection for a SupSBM setting in which triangles or
3-uniform hyperedges are superimposed with undirected edges. As part of our
analysis, we also derive new bounds on the misclustering error of higher-order
spectral clustering methods for the standard SBM and the 3-uniform hypergraph
SBM. Furthermore, for a non-uniform hypergraph SBM model in which one directly
observes both edges and 3-uniform hyperedges, we obtain a criterion that
describes when to perform spectral clustering based on edges and when on
hyperedges, based on a function of hyperedge density and observation quality.

publication to Icarus. This paper responds to W2018 and has been updated to
address comments from two rounds of peer review at Icarus. Points raised by
Wright et al. during peer review and in recent publications are also addressed.
The response here presents issues of broad interest to the planetary science
community. W2018 acknowledges some of the most serious issues identified by
Myhrvold, including the importance of Kirchhoff's law and the misrepresentation
of diameters copied from previous radar, occultation, and spacecraft
observations as NEOWISE thermal modeling results. W2018 confirms copying ROS
diameters for 117 asteroids but does not report actual modeled diameters or the
identity of the asteroids involved. W2018 confirms that many NEOWISE ""fit""
curves do not pass near the data points they claimed to fit. W2018 reveals more
serious problems with NEOWISE results than had previously been understood.
Wright et al. belatedly disclose a software bug, found and corrected in 2011,
that apparently corrupted the vast majority of NEOWISE results, which have yet
to be corrected. W2018 asserts that the bug had rare and small impacts on
results but elsewhere provides analysis that directly contradicts this claim.
We learn from W2018 that H values used by NEOWISE were not taken from the
literature, as claimed, but rather derived by fitting data, a method
inconsistent with prior NEOWISE papers and practice in thermal modeling. The
systematic underestimation of WISE observation errors shown in Myhrvold 2018b
is confirmed with a new analysis of repeated observation of calibration stars.
Each argument in W2018 is shown here to be mistaken. Ultimately, W2018 reveals
why the results of the empirical examination that Myhrvold published were
important.

networks will be the ability to provide scalable group communication. Current
communication paradigms, including unicast and multicast, require explicit
identification of destination nodes (through node IDs or group membership
protocols), while directory services translate logical, interest-specific
queries into destination IDs where parties are then connected using
interest-oblivious protocols. The power and scalability of such paradigms is
quite limited in the context of future, highly dynamic mobile social networks,
where it is desirable in many scenarios to support implicit membership based on
interest. In such scenarios, membership in interest-groups is not explicitly
expressed by users, it is rather autonomously inferred by network protocols
based on behavioral profiles. This removes the dependence on third parties (via
directory lookup), the need for explicit expression of interest (or human
intervention), and minimizes delivery overhead to uninterested users. While
existing types of social networks will likely evolve in the context of mobile
networks, we provide a novel paradigm of communication, deviating significantly
from existing approaches and subsequently enabling qualitatively different
capabilities for future services in mobile societies. In addition, our services

conjectures have been performed at weak coupling. Testing these ideas beyond
the weak coupling regime remains challenging. We propose to exploit the modular
symmetries of the moduli effective action to check swampland constraints beyond
perturbation theory. As an example we study the case of heterotic 4d
$\mathcal{N}=1$ compactifications, whose non-perturbative effective action is
known to be invariant under modular symmetries acting on the K\""ahler and
complex structure moduli, in particular $SL(2,Z)$ T-dualities (or subgroups
thereof) for 4d heterotic or orbifold compactifications. Remarkably, in models
with non-perturbative superpotentials, the corresponding duality invariant
potentials diverge at points at infinite distance in moduli space. The
divergence relates to towers of states becoming light, in agreement with the
distance conjecture. We discuss specific examples of this behavior based on
gaugino condensation in heterotic orbifolds. We show that these examples are
dual to compactifications of type I' or Horava-Witten theory, in which the
$SL(2,Z)$ acts on the complex structure of an underlying 2-torus, and the tower
of light states correspond to D0-branes or M-theory KK modes. The
non-perturbative examples explored point to potentials not leading to weak
coupling at infinite distance, but rather diverging in the asymptotic corners
of moduli space, dynamically forbidding the access to points with global
symmetries. We perform a study of general modular invariant potentials and find
that there are dS maxima and saddle points but no dS minima, and that all

to a rapidly applied step in external pressure. Insights from the perspective
of nonlinear dynamics reveal essential mathematical features of the buckling
phenomena. To capture the strong buckling imperfection-sensitivity, initial
geometric imperfections in the form of an axisymmetric dimple at each pole are
introduced. Dynamic buckling under the step pressure is related to the
quasi-static buckling pressure. Both loadings produce catastrophic collapse of
the shell for conditions in which the pressure is prescribed. Damping plays an
important role in dynamic buckling because of the time-dependent nonlinear
interaction among modes, particularly the interaction between the spherically
symmetric 'breathing' mode and the buckling mode. In this paper we argue that
the precise frequency dependence of the damping does not matter as most of the
damping happens at a single frequency (the breathing frequency). In general,
there is not a unique step pressure threshold separating responses associated
with buckling from those that do not buckle. Instead there exists a cascade of
buckling thresholds, dependent on the damping and level of imperfection,
separating pressures for which buckling occurs from those for which it does not
occur. For shells with small and moderately small imperfections the dynamic
step buckling pressure can be substantially below the quasi-static buckling
pressure.

kinematics of the two broad line regions (BLRs). Therefore another methods
should be applied to confirm the SMBBHs. One of them is spectropolarimetry. We
rely on numerical modeling of the polarimetry of binary black holes systems
since polarimetry is sensitive to geometry, in order to find specific influence
of supermassive binary black hole (SMBBH) geometry and dynamics on polarized
parameters across the broad line profiles. We apply our method to SMBBHs in
which both components are assumed to be AGNs with distances at the sub-pc
scale. We use a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code that simulates the
geometry, dynamics and emission of a binary system where two black holes are
getting increasingly closer. Each gravitational well is accompanied by its own
BLR and the whole system is surrounded by an accretion flow from the distant
torus. We examine the emission line deformation and predict the polarization
that could be observed. We model broad line polarization for various BLR
geometries with complex kinematics. We find that the presence of SMBBHs can
produce complex polarization angle profiles and strongly affect the polarized
and unpolarized line profiles. Depending on the phase of the SMBBH, the
resulting double-peaked emission lines either show red or blue peak dominance,
or both the peak can have the same intensity. In some cases, the whole line
profile appears as a single Gaussian line, hiding the true nature of the

coupling in the model Fermi liquid Sr2RuO4 using laser-based angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy. Our precise measurement of the Fermi surface
confirms the importance of spin-orbit coupling in this material and reveals
that its effective value is enhanced by a factor of about two, due to
electronic correlations. The self-energies for the $\beta$ and $\gamma$ sheets
are found to display significant angular dependence. By taking into account the
multi-orbital composition of quasiparticle states, we determine self-energies
associated with each orbital component directly from the experimental data.
This analysis demonstrates that the perceived angular dependence does not imply
momentum-dependent many-body effects, but arises from a substantial orbital
mixing induced by spin-orbit coupling. A comparison to single-site dynamical
mean-field theory further supports the notion of dominantly local orbital
self-energies, and provides strong evidence for an electronic origin of the
observed non-linear frequency dependence of the self-energies, leading to
`kinks' in the quasiparticle dispersion of Sr2RuO4.

Magnetization shows a step-like behavior with pronounced plateaus in a specific

ZnSe are deposited on glass substrates (at two different substrate temperature)
by the spray pyrolysis technique and annealed in vacuum at $400^\circ$C for 1
hour. Hereby, we investigate the morphology, structural and optical properties

reveal that annealed films grown on glass substrate at $400^\circ$C are

grains size, the diameter and density of the particles increase. The UV-vis
measurements display a red-shift of the absorption edge from the as-deposited

relativity involve some form of regularization of the field equations. In a
recent proposal that relies on the dual foliation formalism this is achieved by
the use of an asymptotically Minkowskian generalized harmonic tensor basis. For
the scheme to work however, derivatives of certain coordinate light-speeds must
decay fast enough. Presently, we generalize the method of asymptotic expansions
for nonlinear wave equations to treat first order symmetric hyperbolic systems.
We then use this heuristic tool to extract the expected rates of decay of the
metric near null-infinity in a free-evolution setting. We show, within the
asymptotic expansion, that by carefully modifying the non-principal part of the
field equations by the addition of constraints, we are able to obtain optimal
decay rates even when the constraints are violated. The light-speed condition
can hence be satisfied, which paves the way for the explicit numerical
treatment of future null-infinity. We then study the behavior of the
Trautman-Bondi mass under the decay results predicted by the asymptotic
expansion. Naively the mass seems to be unbounded, but we see first that the
divergent terms can be replaced with a combination of the constraints and the
Einstein field equations, and second that the Bondi mass loss formula is
recovered within the framework. Both of the latter results hold in the presence
of small constraint violations.

discoveries for hypotheses classified according to one criterion, which we
refer to as one-way classified hypotheses. Although simultaneous classification
of hypotheses according to two different criteria, resulting in two-way
classified hypotheses, do often occur in scientific studies, no such research
has taken place yet, as far as we know, under this structure. This article
produces procedures, both in their oracle and data-adaptive forms, for
controlling the overall false discovery rate (FDR) across all hypotheses
effectively capturing the underlying one- or two-way classification structure.
They have been obtained by using results associated with weighted
Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure in their more general forms providing
guidance on how to adapt the original BH procedure to the underlying one- or
two-way classification structure through an appropriate choice of the weights.
The FDR is maintained non-asymptotically by our proposed procedures in their
oracle forms under positive regression dependence on subset of null $p$-values
(PRDS) and in their data-adaptive forms under independence of the $p$-values.
Possible control of FDR for our data-adaptive procedures in certain scenarios
involving dependent $p$-values have been investigated through simulations. The
fact that our suggested procedures can be superior to contemporary practices
has been demonstrated through their applications in simulated scenarios and to
real-life data sets. While the procedures proposed here for two-way classified
hypotheses are new, the data-adaptive procedure obtained for one-way classified

  Robert P. Behringer",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We experimentally study the frictional behavior of a two-dimensional slider
pulled slowly over a granular substrate comprised of photoelastic disks. The
slider is vibrated at frequencies ranging from 0 to 30 Hz in a direction
parallel to sliding. The applied vibrations have constant peak acceleration,
which results in constant average friction levels. Surprisingly, we find that
stick-slip behavior, where stress slowly builds up and is released in
intermittent slips, is enhanced as the frequency of vibration is increased. Our
results suggest that increasing the frequency of vibration may help to combine
many smaller rearrangements into fewer, but larger, avalanche-like slips, a
mechanism unique to granular systems. We also examine the manner in which the
self affine character of the force curves evolves with frequency, and we find
additional support for this interpretation.

  Networks",,,,,"cs.NI cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Several organizations have built multiple datacenters connected via dedicated
wide area networks over which large inter-datacenter transfers take place. This
includes tremendous volumes of bulk multicast traffic generated as a result of
data and content replication. Although one can perform these transfers using a
single multicast forwarding tree, that can lead to poor performance as the
slowest receiver on each tree dictates the completion time for all receivers.
Using multiple trees per transfer each connected to a subset of receivers
alleviates this concern. The choice of multicast trees also determines the
total bandwidth usage. To further improve the performance, bandwidth over
dedicated inter-datacenter networks can be carved for different multicast trees
over specific time periods to avoid congestion and minimize the average
receiver completion times.
  In this paper, we break this problem into the three sub-problems of
partitioning, tree selection, and rate allocation. We present an algorithm
called QuickCast which is computationally fast and allows us to significantly
speed up multiple receivers per bulk multicast transfer with control over extra
bandwidth consumption. We evaluate QuickCast against a variety of synthetic and
real traffic patterns as well as real WAN topologies. Compared to performing
bulk multicast transfers as separate unicast transfers, QuickCast achieves up
to $3.64\times$ reduction in mean completion times while at the same time using
$0.71\times$ the bandwidth. Also, QuickCast allows the top $50\%$ of receivers
to complete between $3\times$ to $35\times$ faster on average compared with
when a single forwarding multicast tree is used for data delivery.

composite convex objective function. The basic setting is that the objective is
the sum of two convex functions: the first function is smooth with up to the
d-th order derivative information available, and the second function is
possibly non-smooth, but its proximal tensor mappings can be computed
approximately in an efficient manner. The problem is to find -- in that setting
-- the best possible (optimal) iteration complexity for convex optimization.
Along that line, for the smooth case (without the second non-smooth part in the
objective), Nesterov (1983) proposed an optimal algorithm for the first-order
methods (d=1) with iteration complexity O( 1 / k^2 ). A high-order tensor
algorithm with iteration complexity of O( 1 / k^{d+1} ) was proposed by Baes
(2009) and Nesterov (2018). In this paper, we propose a new high-order tensor
algorithm for the general composite case, with the iteration complexity of O( 1
/ k^{(3d+1)/2} ), which matches the lower bound for the d-th order methods as
established in Nesterov (2018), and Shamir et al. (2018), and hence is optimal.
Our approach is based on the Accelerated Hybrid Proximal Extragradient (A-HPE)
framework proposed in Monteiro and Svaiter (2013), where a bisection procedure
is installed for each A-HPE iteration. At each bisection step a proximal tensor
subproblem is approximately solved, and the total number of bisection steps per
A-HPE iteration is bounded by a logarithmic factor in the precision required.

for Fe II,$\lambda$5018, and therefore support the use of this line as a
metallicity probe, in agreement with a number of recent works. In addition, we
find that the SNe in faint (low-metallicity) hosts may be more luminous on

systems: the online comparison of the aggregate values of two sequences of
quantitative weights. This notion is embodied by comparator automata
(comparators, in short), a new class of automata that read two infinite
sequences of weights synchronously and relate their aggregate values.
  We show that aggregate functions that can be represented with B\""uchi
automaton result in comparators that are finite-state and accept by the B\""uchi
condition as well. Such $\omega$-regular comparators further lead to generic
algorithms for a number of well-studied problems, including the quantitative
inclusion and winning strategies in quantitative graph games with incomplete

finite representation of all counterexamples in the quantitative inclusion
problem.
  We study comparators for two aggregate functions: discounted-sum and
limit-average. We prove that the discounted-sum comparator is $\omega$-regular
iff the discount-factor is an integer. Not every aggregate function, however,
has an $\omega$-regular comparator. Specifically, we show that the language of
sequence-pairs for which limit-average aggregates exist is neither
$\omega$-regular nor $\omega$-context-free. Given this result, we introduce the
notion of prefix-average as a relaxation of limit-average aggregation, and show
that it admits $\omega$-context-free comparators i.e. comparator automata
expressed by B\""uchi pushdown automata.

atom-centered electronic descriptors are then built from this density to train
a neural network to correct the baseline DFT energies and forces. These
electronic descriptors encode much more information than local atomic
environments, allowing a simple neural network to reach the accuracy required

efficiency is determined by the baseline simulation. This is shown in results
where high level quantum chemical accuracy is obtained for simulations of
liquid water at standard DFT cost, or where high level DFT-accuracy is achieved
in simulations with a low-level baseline DFT calculation, at a significantly
reduced cost.

event-based computation. However, supervised training of SNNs remains a
challenge as spike activities are non-differentiable. Previous SNNs training
methods can be generally categorized into two basic classes, i.e.,
backpropagation-like training methods and plasticity-based learning methods.
The former methods are dependent on energy-inefficient real-valued computation
and non-local transmission, as also required in artificial neural networks
(ANNs), whereas the latter are either considered to be biologically implausible
or exhibit poor performance. Hence, biologically plausible (bio-plausible)
high-performance supervised learning (SL) methods for SNNs remain deficient. In
this paper, we proposed a novel bio-plausible SNN model for SL based on the
symmetric spike-timing dependent plasticity (sym-STDP) rule found in
neuroscience. By combining the sym-STDP rule with bio-plausible synaptic
scaling and intrinsic plasticity of the dynamic threshold, our SNN model
implemented SL well and achieved good performance in the benchmark recognition
task (MNIST dataset). To reveal the underlying mechanism of our SL model, we
visualized both layer-based activities and synaptic weights using the
t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) method after training and
found that they were well clustered, thereby demonstrating excellent
classification ability. Furthermore, to verify the robustness of our model, we
trained it on another more realistic dataset (Fashion-MNIST), which also showed
good performance. As the learning rules were bio-plausible and based purely on
local spike events, our model could be easily applied to neuromorphic hardware
for online training and may be helpful for understanding SL information
processing at the synaptic level in biological neural systems.

clear separation between the design and the analysis; b) robustness to model
misspecification or to the presence of extreme values of the estimated GPS; c)
straightforward assessment of covariate balance. We first introduce an
assumption of identifiability, called local weak unconfoundedness. Under this

that our proposed matching estimator attains point-wise consistency and
asymptotic normality. In simulations, our proposed matching approach
outperforms existing methods under settings of model misspecification or the

  Partial CSI","Part of this article is submitted to 2019 ICC",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Antenna selection (AS) is regarded as the key promising technology to reduce
hardware cost but keep relatively high spectral efficiency in multi-antenna
systems. By selecting a subset of antennas to transceive messages, AS greatly
alleviates the requirement on Radio Frequency (RF) chains. This paper studies
receive antenna selection in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems. The receiver, equipped with a large-scale antenna array whose size is
much larger than that of the transmitter, selects a subset of antennas to
receive messages. A low-complexity asymptotic approximated upper capacity bound
is derived in the limit of massive MIMO systems over independent and identical
distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh flat fading channel, assuming that the channel
side information (CSI) is only available at the receiver. Furthermore,
numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the approximation precision
of the asymptotic results and the tightness of the capacity bound. Besides the
asymptotic analysis of the upper bound, more discussions on the ergodic
capacity of the antenna selection systems are exhibited. By defining the number
of corresponding rows in the channel matrix as the amount of acquired CSI, the
relationship between the achievable channel capacity and the amount of acquired
CSI is investigated. Our findings indicate that this relationship approximately
follows the Pareto principle, i.e., most of the capacity can be achieved by
acquiring a small portion of full CSI. Finally, on the basis of this observed
law, an adaptive AS algorithm is proposed, which can achieve most of the
transmission rate but requires much less CSI and computation complexity
compared to state-of-the-art methods.

applications, but their demanding storage and computational resource
requirements prevent their applications on mobile devices. Knowledge
distillation aims to optimize a portable student network by taking the
knowledge from a well-trained heavy teacher network. Traditional
teacher-student based methods used to rely on additional fully-connected layers
to bridge intermediate layers of teacher and student networks, which brings in
a large number of auxiliary parameters. In contrast, this paper aims to
propagate information from teacher to student without introducing new variables
which need to be optimized. We regard the teacher-student paradigm from a new
perspective of feature embedding. By introducing the locality preserving loss,
the student network is encouraged to generate the low-dimensional features
which could inherit intrinsic properties of their corresponding
high-dimensional features from teacher network. The resulting portable network
thus can naturally maintain the performance as that of the teacher network.
Theoretical analysis is provided to justify the lower computation complexity of
the proposed method. Experiments on benchmark datasets and well-trained
networks suggest that the proposed algorithm is superior to state-of-the-art
teacher-student learning methods in terms of computational and storage
complexity.

radios operating at a frequency range of 3.1 GHz - 4.8 GHz and UWB planar
elliptical dipole antennas having an omni-directional pattern in the azimuth
plane and typical donut shaped pattern in the elevation plane. Three scenarios
were considered for the channel measurements: (i)two receivers (RXs) at
different heights above the ground and placed close to each other in
line-of-sight (LOS) with the transmitter (TX) on the UAV and the UAV is
hovering; (ii) RXs are in obstructed line-of-sight (OLOS) with the UAV TX due
to foliage, and the UAV is hovering; and, (iii) UAV is moving in a circular
path. Different horizontal and vertical distances between the RXs and TX were
used in the measurements. In addition, two different antenna orientations were
used on the UAV antennas (vertical and horizontal) to analyze the effects of
antenna radiation patterns on the UWB AG propagation. From the empirical
results, it was observed that the received power depends mainly on the antenna
radiation pattern in the elevation plane when the antennas are oriented in the
same direction, as expected for these omni-azimuth antennas. Moreover, the
overall antenna gain at the TX and RX can be approximated using trigonometric
functions of the elevation angle.

one for reducing the computational cost and storage overhead. Most of
state-of-the-art results are obtained in a layer-by-layer optimization mode. It
discards the unimportant input neurons and uses the survived ones to
reconstruct the output neurons approaching to the original ones in a
layer-by-layer manner. However, an unnoticed problem arises that the
information loss is accumulated as layer increases since the survived neurons
still do not encode the entire information as before. A better alternative is
to propagate the entire useful information to reconstruct the pruned layer
instead of directly discarding the less important neurons. To this end, we
propose a novel Layer Decomposition-Recomposition Framework (LDRF) for neuron
pruning, by which each layer's output information is recovered in an embedding
space and then propagated to reconstruct the following pruned layers with
useful information preserved. We mainly conduct our experiments on ILSVRC-12

results before end-to-end fine-tuning are significantly superior owing to the

The proposed method is tested on experimental data obtained by the voice

high accuracy of diagnosis of PD patients from healthy people, than the
conventional methods like Support Vector Machine (SVM) and other mentioned in

problem that the high-order cepstrum coefficients are small and the features

computational loads of the loss function, and increases the training speed of
the system. DNN classifier enhances the classification ability of voiceprint

  Framework for Time Varying System in Distribution Grids",,,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Grid topology and line parameters are essential for grid operation and
planning, which may be missing or inaccurate in distribution grids. Existing
data-driven approaches for recovering such information usually suffer from
ignoring 1) input measurement errors and 2) possible state changes among
historical measurements. While using the errors-in-variables (EIV) model and
letting the parameter and topology estimation interact with each other (PaToPa)
can address input and output measurement error modeling, it only works when all
measurements are from a single system state. To solve the two challenges
simultaneously, we propose the PaToPaEM framework for joint line parameter and
topology estimation with historical measurements from different unknown states.
We improve the static framework that only works when measurements are from one
single state, by further treating state changes in historical measurements as
an unobserved latent variable. We then systematically analyze the new
mathematical modeling, decouple the optimization problem, and incorporate the
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to recover different hidden states in
measurements. Combining these, PaToPaEM framework enables joint topology and
line parameter estimation using noisy measurements from multiple system states.
It lays a solid foundation for data-driven system identification in
distribution grids. Superior numerical results validate the practicability of
the PaToPaEM framework.

are in high demand in the field of non-equilibrium theory. In this paper, we
present a new method based on variational superposed Gaussian approximation
(VSGA) and Pad\'e approximant. The VSGA obtains time-dependent probability
density functions as a superposition of multiple Gaussian distributions.
However, a limitation of the VSGA is that the expectation of the drift term
with respect to the Gaussian distribution should be calculated analytically,
which is typically satisfied when the drift term is a polynomial function. When
this condition is not met, the VSGA must rely on the numerical integration of
the expectation at each step, resulting in huge computational cost. We propose
an augmented VSGA (A-VSGA) method that effectively overcomes the limitation of
the VSGA by approximating non-linear functions with the Pad\'e approximant. We
apply the A-VSGA to two systems driven by chaotic input signals, a stochastic
genetic regulatory system and a soft bistable system, whose drift terms are a
rational polynomial function and a hyperbolic tangent function, respectively.
The numerical calculations show that the proposed method can provide accurate
results with less temporal cost than that required for Monte Carlo simulation.

that the Fock energy in the kinetic equation is equivalent to the generalized
Ward's identity. Hence, the gauge invariance directly leads to the charge
conservation. Both linear and second-order responses are investigated. The
linear response of the Higgs mode vanishes in the long-wave limit. Whereas the
linear response of the Nambu-Goldstone mode interacts with the long-range
Coulomb interaction, causing the original gapless spectrum lifted up to the
plasma frequency as a result of the Anderson-Higgs mechanism, in consistency
with the previous works. The second-order response exhibits interesting
physics. On one hand, a finite second-order response of the Higgs mode is
obtained in the long-wave limit. We reveal that this response, which has been
experimentally observed, is attributed solely to the drive effect rather than
the widely considered Anderson-pump effect. On the other hand, the second-order
response of the Nambu-Goldstone mode, free from the influence of the long-range
Coulomb interaction and hence the Anderson-Higgs mechanism, is predicted. We
find that both Anderson-pump and drive effects play important role in this
response. A tentative scheme to detect this second-order response is proposed.

The synthesizer is trained in a semisupervised manner. In the supervised
training process, a limited amount of paired ADC-T2w images and the
corresponding ADC encodings are provided and the synthesizer learns the paired
relationship by explicitly minimizing the reconstruction losses between
synthetic and real images. To avoid overfitting limited ADC encodings, an
unlimited amount of random latent vectors and unpaired ADC-T2w Images are
utilized in the unsupervised training process for learning the marginal image
distributions of real images. To improve the robustness of synthesizing, we
decompose the difficult task of generating full-size images into several
simpler tasks which generate sub-images only. A StitchLayer is then employed to
fuse sub-images together in an interlaced manner into a full-size image. To
enforce the synthetic images to indeed contain distinguishable CS PCa lesions,
we propose to also maximize an auxiliary distance of Jensen-Shannon divergence

collapse into a rapidly rotating neutron star (NS), accompanying with a mass
ejection of a few times $0.01M_{\odot}$. Bright optical transient emission can
be produced by the ejecta due to heating by radioactivities and particularly by
energy injection from the NS. Since the merger remnants before collapse
resemble a star evolving from the asymptotic giant branch phase to the
planetary nebula phase, an intense dusty wind is considered to be driven about
several thousand years ago before the collapse and surround the remnant at
large radii. Therefore, the optical transient emission can be somewhat absorbed
and scattered by the dusty wind, which can suppress the peak emission and cause
a scattering plateau in optical light curves. Several years later, as the
ejecta finally catches up with the wind material, the shock interaction between
them can further give rise to a detectable radio transient emission on a
timescale of tens of days. Discovery of and observations to such dust-affected
optical transients and shock-driven radio transients can help to explore the
nature of super-Chandrasekhar merger remnants and as well as the density and
type ratios of double white dwarf systems, which is beneficial in assessing

  SOC implements the Monte Carlo radiative transfer method as a parallel
program for shared memory computers. It can be used to study dust extinction,
scattering, and emission. We tested SOC with realistic cloud models and
examined the convergence and noise of the dust temperature estimates and of the
resulting surface brightness maps.
  SOC has been demonstrated to produces accurate estimates for dust scattering
and for thermal dust emission. It performs well with both with CPUs and with
GPUs, the latter providing up to an order of magnitude speed-up. In the test
cases, ALI improved the convergence rates but also was sensitive to Monte Carlo
noise. Run-time refinement of the hierarchical-grid models did not help in
reducing the run times required for a given accuracy of solution. The use of a
reference field, without ALI, works more robustly. It also allows the run time
to be optimised if the number of photon packages is increased only as the
iterations progress.

disturbed by a NACA 4415 airfoil and a cylinder with clearance $h\leqslant

two- and three-dimensional stationary eigenmodes. There is a less damped
oscillation mode at a small wavenumbers range. The strong effect of
three-dimensionality is further confirmed in a non-modal analysis framework.
Transient growth analysis shows that the most strongest optimal perturbation is

given function is indeed reachable. In this paper, we pursue the study of the
reachable states of parabolic equations based on a direct approach using
control inputs in Gevrey spaces by considering a nonlinear heat equation in
dimension one. The nonlinear part is assumed to be an analytic function of the
spatial variable x, the unknown y, and its derivative $\partial$ x y. By
investigating carefully a nonlinear Cauchy problem in the spatial variable and
the relationship between the jet of space derivatives and the jet of time
derivatives, we derive an exact controllability result for small initial and

realistic possibility with the development of CRISPR-Cas genetic engineering. A
gene drive may however have to be stopped. ""Antidotes"" (brakes) have been
suggested, but have been so far only studied in well-mixed populations. Here,
we consider a reaction--diffusion system modeling the release of a gene drive
(of fitness $1-a$) and a brake (fitness $1-b$, $b\leq a$) in a wild-type
population (fitness $1$). We prove that, whenever the drive fitness is at most
$1/2$ while the brake fitness is close to $1$, coextinction of the brake and
the drive occurs in the long run. On the contrary, if the drive fitness is
greater than $1/2$, then coextinction is impossible: the drive and the brake
keep spreading spatially, leaving in the invasion wake a complicated
spatio-temporally heterogeneous genetic pattern. Based on numerical
experiments, we argue in favor of a global coextinction conjecture provided the
drive fitness is at most $1/2$, irrespective of the brake fitness. The proof
relies upon the study of a related predator--prey system with strong Allee
effect on the prey. Our results indicate that some drives may be unstoppable,
and that, if gene drives are ever deployed in nature, threshold drives, that
only spread if introduced in high enough frequencies, should be preferred.

mechanisms peculiar to the environment of the spins. The measurements are
conducted at low temperatures ($T\approx 100$~mK), as a function of external
magnetic field $B_0$ and donor electrochemical potential $\mu_{\rm D}$. We
observe a magnetic field dependence of the form $1/T_1\propto B_0^5$ for
$B_0\gtrsim 3\,$ T, corresponding to the phonon-induced relaxation typical of
donors in the bulk. However, the relaxation rate varies by up to two orders of
magnitude between different devices. We attribute these differences to
variations in lattice strain at the location of the donor. For $B_0\lesssim
3\,$T, the relaxation rate changes to $1/T_1\propto B_0$ for two devices. This
is consistent with relaxation induced by evanescent-wave Johnson noise created
by the metal structures fabricated above the donors. At such low fields, where
$T_1>1\,$s, we also observe and quantify the spurious increase of $1/T_1$ when
the electrochemical potential of the spin excited state $|\uparrow\rangle$
comes in proximity to empty states in the charge reservoir, leading to
spin-dependent tunneling that resets the spin to $|\downarrow\rangle$. These
results give precious insights into the microscopic phenomena that affect spin
relaxation in MOS nanoscale devices, and provide strategies for engineering

infer the role of surface chemistry on the QD optical absorption properties:
ligand chalcogen binding atoms mainly determine band gap reduction, related to
np occupied orbital contribution to the valence band edge, and mediates
broadband absorption enhancement, fostered by the conjugation of the ligand
pendant moiety, with further contribution from electron donor substituents.

increase light absorption by solar cells. However, the use of plasmonic NPs in

inserting plasmonic NPs into a perovskite active layer produces any performance
advantage compared with a pure perovskite counterpart. We explore the

simulated data we reproduced the same unbiased result in roughly the same
redshift range and determined the error (and bias above $z\approx4$) in the
photometric redshifts. Based on the multifilter technique, and a selection
based on color, flux, and agreement of fit between the observed photometry and
assumed SED, we find 370 robust candidates to be relatively bright
high-redshift sources. A second sample with 237 objects focuses on the faint
end at high-redshift. These 237 sources were previously near the H-ATLAS
detection limit but are now confirmed with our technique as high significance
detections. Finally, we look for possible lensed Herschel sources by
cross-correlating the first sample of 370 objects with two different catalogs
of known low-redshift objects, the redMaPPer Galaxy Cluster Catalog and a
catalog of galaxies with spectroscopic redshift from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey Data Release 14. Our search renders a number of candidates to be lensed
systems from the SDSS cross-correlation but none from the redMaPPeR confirming
the more likely galactic nature of the lenses.

point using a spectral partitioning technique. Because these wave partitions
are usually organized according to the magnitude of their wave energy without
considering the coherence of wave parameters in space, it can be difficult to
observe the spatial distributions of wave field features from these outputs. In
this study, an approach for spatially tracking coherent wave events (which
means a cluster of partitions originated from the same meteorological event)
from partitioned numerical wave model outputs is presented to solve this
problem. First, an efficient traverse algorithm applicable for different types
of grids, termed breadth-first search, is employed to track wave events using
the continuity of wave parameters. Second, to reduce the impact of the garden
sprinkler effect on tracking, tracked wave events are merged if their boundary
outlines and wave parameters on these boundaries are both in good agreement.
Partitioned wave information from the Integrated Ocean Waves for Geophysical

capture the primary features of partitioned wave fields, demonstrating its

(cut-off factors), and the guaranteed upper bound features the same weights. We
prove that the inclusion of these weights is not only sufficient but also
necessary for robustness of any flux equilibration estimate that does not
employ submeshes or estimators combination, which shows that some of the flux
equilibrations proposed in the past cannot be robust. To achieve the fully
computable upper bound, we derive explicit bounds for some inverse inequality

instruments in the MeV-GeV energy range, the photons of a given source are
mixed with those coming from nearby sources or diffuse background. This source
confusion seriously hampers the search for pulsation from faint sources.
Statistical tests for pulsation can be made significantly more sensitive when
the probability that a photon comes from the pulsar is used as a weight.
However, the computation of this probability requires knowing the spectral
model of all sources in the region of interest, including the pulsar itself.
This is not possible for very faint pulsars that are not detected as gamma-ray
sources or whose spectrum is not measured precisely enough. Extending the
event-weighted pulsation search to such very faint gamma-ray sources would
allow improving our knowledge of the gamma-ray pulsar population. We present
two methods that overcome this limitation by scanning the spectral parameter
space, while minimizing the number of trials. The first one approximates the
source/background ratio yielding a simple estimate of the weight while the
second one makes use of the full spatial and spectral information of the region
of interest around the pulsar. We test these new methods on a sample of 144
gamma-ray pulsars already detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope data. Both
methods detect pulsation from all pulsars of the sample, including the ones for
which no significant phase-averaged gamma-ray emission is detected.

Below a few GeVs the flux of antiparticles produced by cosmic-ray collisions

well-motivated beyond-standard models predict a sizable contribution to the
antideuteron flux. GAPS is planned to fly on a long-duration balloon over
Antarctica in the austral summer of 2020. The primary detector is a 1m3 central
volume containing planes of Si(Li) detectors. This volume is surrounded by a
time-of-flight system to both trigger the Si(Li) detector and reconstruct the
particle tracks. The detection principle of the experiment relies on the
identification of the antiparticle annihilation pattern. Low energy
antiparticles slow down in the apparatus and they are captured in the medium to
form exotic excited atoms, which de-excite by emitting characteristic X-rays.
Afterwards they undergo nuclear annihilation, resulting in a star of pions and
protons. The simultaneous measurement of the stopping depth and the dE/dx loss
of the primary antiparticle, of the X-ray energies and of the star
particle-multiplicity provides very high rejection power, that is critical in
rare-event search. GAPS will be able to perform a precise measurement of the

by making measurements on identical copies of the state. Current algorithms are
costly both on the experimental front -- requiring vast numbers of measurements
-- as well as in terms of the computational time to analyze those measurements.
In this paper, we address the problem of analysis speed and flexibility,
introducing \textit{Neural Adaptive Quantum State Tomography} (NA-QST), a
machine learning based algorithm for quantum state tomography that adapts
measurements and provides orders of magnitude faster processing while retaining
state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy. Our algorithm is inspired by particle
swarm optimization and Bayesian particle-filter based adaptive methods, which
we extend and enhance using neural networks. The resampling step, in which a
bank of candidate solutions -- particles -- is refined, is in our case learned
directly from data, removing the computational bottleneck of standard methods.
We successfully replace the Bayesian calculation that requires computational
time of $O(\mathrm{poly}(n))$ with a learned heuristic whose time complexity
empirically scales as $O(\log(n))$ with the number of copies measured $n$,
while retaining the same reconstruction accuracy. This corresponds to a factor
of a million speedup for $10^7$ copies measured. We demonstrate that our
algorithm learns to work with basis, symmetric informationally complete (SIC),
as well as other types of POVMs. We discuss the value of measurement adaptivity
for each POVM type, demonstrating that its effect is significant only for basis
POVMs. Our algorithm can be retrained within hours on a single laptop for a
two-qubit situation, which suggests a feasible time-cost when extended to
larger systems. It can also adapt to a subset of possible states, a choice of
the type of measurement, and other experimental details.

diffusing (retweeting) tweets of political parties. The results indicate that
the characteristics of retweeters of the largest ruling party (Liberal

in the computer vision community. However, to what extent the computer vision

will fail when encountering objects in context distributions different from
training data and hence it is important to identify these dependencies before
we can deploy the models in the real-world. We propose a method to quantify the
sensitivity of black-box vision models to visual context by editing images to
remove selected objects and measuring the response of the target models. We
apply this methodology on two tasks, image classification and semantic
segmentation, and discover undesirable dependency between objects and context,
for example that ""sidewalk"" segmentation relies heavily on ""cars"" being present
in the image. We propose an object removal based data augmentation solution to
mitigate this dependency and increase the robustness of classification and
segmentation models to contextual variations. Our experiments show that the
proposed data augmentation helps these models improve the performance in
out-of-context scenarios, while preserving the performance on regular data.

merger trees with the Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) code RAMSES, is presented.
The algorithm is fully parallel and based on the Message Passing Interface
(MPI). As opposed to most available merger tree tools, it works on the fly
during the course of the N body simulation. It can track dark matter
substructures individually using the index of the most bound particle in the
clump. Once a halo (or a sub-halo) merges into another one, the algorithm still
tracks it through the last identified most bound particle in the clump,
allowing to check at later snapshots whether the merging event was definitive,
or whether it was only temporary, with the clump only traversing another one.
The same technique can be used to track orphan galaxies that are not assigned
to a parent clump anymore because the clump dissolved due to numerical
over-merging. We study in detail the impact of various parameters on the
resulting halo catalogues and corresponding merger histories. We then compare
the performance of our method using standard validation diagnostics,
demonstrating that we reach a quality similar to the best available and
commonly used merger tree tools. As a proof of concept, we use our merger tree
algorithm together with a parametrised stellar-mass-to-halo-mass relation and
generate a mock galaxy catalogue that shows good agreement with observational
data.

employ the time-dependent Bogoliubov variational wave function and find that,
in certain momentum regimes, the momentum distribution at long times displays
the same exponential behavior found by the experiment. Moreover, we find that
this behavior is universal and independent of the short-range details of the
interaction potential. Consistent with the relation found in the two-body

velocity (RV) signals that can be misinterpreted as planetary signals. Among
the nearby stars, we have selected Barnard's Star (Gl 699) to carry out a
characterization of these phenomena using a set of spectroscopic data that
covers about 14.5 years and comes from seven different spectrographs: HARPS,
HARPS-N, CARMENES, HIRES, UVES, APF, and PFS; and a set of photometric data
that covers about 15.1 years and comes from four different photometric sources:
ASAS, FCAPT-RCT, AAVSO, and SNO. We have measured different chromospheric
activity indicators (H$\alpha$, Ca~{\sc II}~HK and Na I D), as well as the FWHM
of the cross-correlation function computed for a sub-set of the spectroscopic
data. The analysis of Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodograms of the time series
of different activity indicators reveals that the rotation period of the star
is 145 $\pm$ 15 days, consistent with the expected rotation period according to
the low activity level of the star and previous claims. The upper limit of the
predicted activity-induced RV signal corresponding to this rotation period is
about 1 m/s. We also find evidence of a long-term cycle of 10 $\pm$ 2 years

time series in other M stars of similar activity levels. The available
photometric data of the star also support the detection of both the long-term

multicast is the limited number of layers allowed by the embedded successive
interference cancellation algorithm, failing to meet satisfaction of
heterogeneous receivers. We propose a novel receiver-driven superposed video
multicast (Supcast) scheme by integrating Softcast, an analog-like transmission
scheme, into the NOMA-based system to achieve high bandwidth efficiency as well
as gradual decoding quality proportional to channel conditions at receivers.
Although Softcast allows gradual performance by directly transmitting
power-scaled transformation coefficients of frames, it suffers performance
degradation due to discarding coefficients under insufficient bandwidth and its
power allocation strategy cannot be directly applied in NOMA due to
interference. In Supcast, coefficients are grouped into chunks, which are basic
units for power allocation and superposition scheduling. By bisecting chunks
into base-layer chunks and enhanced-layer chunks, the joint power allocation
and chunk scheduling is formulated as a distortion minimization problem. A
two-stage power allocation strategy and a near-optimal low-complexity algorithm
for chunk scheduling based on the matching theory are proposed. Simulation
results have shown the advantage of Supcast against Softcast as well as the
reference scheme in NOMA under various practical scenarios.

the so-called fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) - often manifest themselves
as fractionally charged quasiparticles (anyons). Moreover, being under special
conditions they are expected to be immune to the environment, thus may serve as
building blocks for future quantum computers. Interference of such anyons is
the very first step towards understanding their anyonic statistics. However,
the complex edge-modes structure of the fractional quantum Hall states,
combined with upstream neutral modes, have been suspected to prevent an
observation of the much sought after interference of anyons. Here, we report of
finding a direct correlation between the appearance of neutral modes and the
gradual disappearance of interference in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI),
as the bulk filling factor is lowered towards Landau filling {\nu}_B =1;
followed by a complete interference quench at {\nu}_B=1. Specifically, the
interference was found to start diminishing at {\nu}_B~1.5 with a growing
upstream neutral mode, which was detected by a born upstream shot noise in the
input quantum point contact (QPC) to the MZI. Moreover, at the same time a
{\nu}_QPC =1/3 conductance plateau, carrying shot-noise, appeared in the
transmission of the QPC - persisting until bulk filling {\nu}_B =1/2. We
identified this conductance plateau to result from edge reconstruction, which
leads to an upstream neutral mode. Here, we also show that even the
particle-like quasiparticles are accompanied by upstream neutral modes,
therefore suppressing interference in the FQHE regime.

stars with different masses and ages.
  We investigated the time-domain photometry provided by Kepler's follow-up
mission K2 and searched for flares in three solar metallicity open clusters
with well-known ages, M45 (0.125 Gyr), M44 (0.63 Gyr), and M67 (4.3 Gyr). We
updated and employed the automated flare finding and analysis pipeline
Appaloosa, originally designed for Kepler. We introduced a synthetic flare
injection and recovery subroutine to ascribe detection and energy recovery
rates for flares in a broad energy range for each light curve. We collected a
sample of 1 761 stars, mostly late-K to mid-M dwarfs and found 751 flare
candidates with energies ranging from $4\cdot10^{32}$ erg to $6\cdot10^{34}$
erg, of which 596 belong to M45, 155 to M44, and none to M67.
  We find that flaring activity depends both on $T_\mathrm{eff}$, and age. But
all flare frequency distributions have similar slopes with $\alpha
\approx2.0-2.4$, supporting a universal flare generation process. We discuss
implications for the physical conditions under which flares occur, and how the

during the star formation process. As gas in a molecular cloud core collapses
under self-gravity, the angular momentum of the gas will slow its collapse on
small scales and promote the formation of a protostellar disc. Although the
angular momenta of dense star-forming cores remain to be fully characterized
observationally, existing data indicates that typical cores have enough angular
momenta to form relatively large, rotationally supported discs. However,
molecular clouds are observed to be permeated by magnetic fields, which can
strongly affect the evolution of angular momentum through magnetic braking.
Indeed, in the ideal MHD limit, magnetic braking has been shown to be so
efficient as to remove essentially all of the angular momentum of the material
close to the forming star such that disc formation is suppressed. This is known
as the magnetic braking catastrophe. The catastrophe must be averted in order
for the all-important rotationally supported discs to appear, but when and how
this happens remains debated. We review the resolutions proposed to date, with
emphasis on misalignment, turbulence and especially non-ideal effects. The
dissipative non-ideal effects weaken the magnetic field, and the dispersive
term redirects it to promote or hinder disc formation. When self-consistently
applying non-ideal processes, rotationally supported discs of at least tens of
au form, thus preventing the magnetic braking catastrophe. The non-ideal
processes are sensitive to the magnetic field strength, cosmic ray ionization
rate, and gas and dust grain properties, thus a complete understanding of the
host molecular cloud is required. Therefore, the properties of the host
molecular cloud -- and especially its magnetic field -- cannot be ignored when
numerically modelling the formation and evolution of protostellar discs.

planet-forming disks that surround many PMS stars. H2 can be incorporated in
the atmosphere of the giant planets. HD has been detected in a few disks and
can be considered the most reliable tracer of H2. We wish to form H2 and HD
efficiently for the varied conditions encountered in protoplanetary disks: the
densities vary from 1E4 to 1E16 cm^-3; the dust temperatures range from 5 to
1500 K, the gas temperatures go from 5 to a few 1000 Kelvin, and the
ultraviolet field can be 1E7 stronger than the standard interstellar field. We
implemented a comprehensive model of H2 and HD formation on cold and warm grain
surfaces and via hydrogenated PAHs in the physico-chemical code ProDiMo. The H2
and HD formation can proceed via the Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Ridel
mechanisms for physisorbed or chemisorbed H (D) atoms. H2 and HD also form by H
(D) abstraction from hydrogenated neutral and ionised PAHs and via gas phase
reactions. H2 and HD are formed efficiently on dust grain surfaces from 10 to
700 K. All the deuterium is converted into HD in UV shielded regions as soon as
H2 is formed by gas-phase D abstraction reactions. The detailed model compares
well with standard analytical prescriptions for H2 (HD) formation. At low
temperatures, H2 is formed from the encounter of two physisorbed atoms. HD
molecules form on the grain surfaces and in the gas-phase. At temperatures
greater than 20 K, the meeting between a weakly bound H- (or D-) atom or a
gas-phase H (D) atom and a chemisorbed atom is the most efficient H2 formation
route. H2 formation through hydrogenated PAHs alone is efficient above 80 K.
The contribution of hydrogenated PAHs to the overall H2 and HD formation is
relatively low if chemisorption on silicate is taken into account and if a
small hydrogen abstraction cross-section is used.

close-to-optimal bounds obtained in the abelian case by Sanders, and improves
the bounds and simplifies the exposition of an earlier result of the author.

which is widely used in various applications. Most of the applied literature is
devoted to the computation for sets consisting of a finite number of points.
This has applications, for instance, in image processing. However, we would
like to apply the Hausdorff distance to control and evaluate optimisation
methods in level-set based shape optimisation. In this context, the involved
sets are not finite point sets but characterised by level-set or signed
distance functions. This paper discusses the computation of the Hausdorff
distance between two such sets. We recall fundamental properties of the
Hausdorff distance, including a characterisation in terms of distance
functions. In numerical applications, this result gives at least an exact lower
bound on the Hausdorff distance. We also derive an upper bound, and
consequently a precise error estimate. By giving an example, we show that our
error estimate cannot be further improved for a general situation. On the other
hand, we also show that much better accuracy can be expected for
non-pathological situations that are more likely to occur in practice. The
resulting error estimate can be improved even further if one assumes that the
grid is rotated randomly with respect to the involved sets.

Below $w/h \sim 2.6$, the simulations provide evidence of a smooth topological

isotropic (spherical) expansion of the fluid downstream the nozzle step. Above
such threshold, the transition from the inner to the outer space involves a
series of dynamical rearrangements which keep the free surface in mechanical

in turn, leads to jet pinching and ultimately to its rupture, namely droplet

(Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 110, 20402 (2013)), directly probes the
intermolecular degrees of freedom of the hydrogen-bond network. However, being
a relatively new technique, its information content is not fully explored as to
date. While the spectroscopic signal can be simulated based on molecular
dynamics simulation in connection with a water force field, it is difficult to
relate spectroscopic signatures to the underlying microscopic features of the
force field. Here, a completely different approach is taken that starts from an
as simple as possible model, i.e., a single vibrational mode with electrical
and mechanical anharmonicity augmented with homogeneous and inhomogeneous
broadening. An intuitive Feynman diagram picture is developed for all possible
pulse sequences of hybrid 2D-Raman-THz spectroscopy. It is shown that the model
can explain the experimental data essentially quantitatively with a very small
set of parameters, and it is tentatively concluded that the experimental signal
originates from the hydrogen-bond stretching vibration around 170 cm$^{-1}$.
Furthermore, the echo observed in the experimental data can be quantified by
fitting the model. A dominant fraction of its linewidth is attributed to
quasi-inhomogeneous broadening in the slow-modulation limit with a correlation
time of 370 fs, reflecting the lifetime of the hydrogen-bond networks giving
rise the absorption band.

tempting in safety-critical applications. However such applications have

the usage of machine learning. We focus in particular on \emph{requirements

  [Problem.] Both code and requirements are a problem when dealing with deep
neural networks: code constituting the network is not comparable to classical
code; furthermore, requirements for applications where neural networks are
required are typically very hard to specify: even though high-level
requirements can be defined, it is very hard to make such requirements concrete
enough, that one can qualify them of low-level requirements. An additional
problem is that deep learning is in practice very much based on
trial-and-error, which makes the final result hard to explain without the
previous iterations.
  [Proposed solution.] We investigate which artifacts could play a similar role
to code or low-level requirements in neural network development and propose
various traces which one could possibly consider as a replacement for classical
notions. We also propose a form of traceability (and new artifacts) in order to
deal with the particular trial-and-error development process for deep learning.

ethical requirements on the illocutionary force edges linking locutions to

and innovative traffic treatments. Surrogate measures of safety have allowed to
step away from traditional safety performance functions and analyze safety
performance without relying on accident records. In recent years, the use of
extreme value theory (EV) models in combination with surrogate safety measures
to estimate accident probabilities has gained popularity within the safety
community. In this paper we extend existing efforts on EV for accident
probability estimation for two dependent surrogate measures. Using detailed
trajectory data from a driving simulator, we model the joint probability of
head-on and rear-end collisions in passing maneuvers. In our estimation we
account for driver specific characteristics and road infrastructure variables.
We show that accounting for these factors improve the head-on collision
probability estimation. This work highlights the importance of considering
driver and road heterogeneity in evaluating related safety events, of relevance
to interventions both for in-vehicle and infrastructure-based solutions. Such
features are essential to keep up with the expectations from surrogate safety
measures for the integrated analysis of accident phenomena.

platform for quantum simulation and quantum computing with trapped atomic ions.
This approach involves placing arrays of micro-structured electrodes defining
static electric quadrupole sites in a magnetic field, with single ions trapped
at each site and coupled to neighbors via the Coulomb interaction. We solve for
the normal modes of ion motion in such arrays, and derive a generalized
multi-ion invariance theorem for stable motion even in the presence of trap
imperfections. We use these techniques to investigate the feasibility of
quantum simulation and quantum computation in fixed ion lattices. In
homogeneous arrays, we show that sufficiently dense arrays are achievable, with
axial, magnetron and cyclotron motions exhibiting inter-ion dipolar coupling
with rates significantly higher than expected decoherence. With the addition of
laser fields these can realize tunable-range interacting spin Hamiltonians. We
also show how local control of potentials allows isolation of small numbers of
ions in a fixed array and can be used to implement high fidelity gates. The use
of static trapping fields means that our approach is not limited by power
requirements as system size increases, removing a major challenge for scaling
which is present in standard radio-frequency traps. Thus the architecture and
methods provided here appear to open a path for trapped-ion quantum computing
to reach fault-tolerant scale devices.

the walk on $G_n$ to the walk on the infinite $d$-regular tree. If one can map
another infinite transitive graph onto $G_n$, then we can improve the strategy
by using a comparison with the random walk on this transitive graph (instead of

cutoff at the entropic time. In this paper, we provide a generalization of the

characterisation of the macroscopic long wavelength Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP)
properties with unprecedented precision, the investigation of the microscopic
parton dynamics underlying QGP properties, the development of a unified picture
of particle production and QCD dynamics from small (pp) to large
(nucleus--nucleus) systems, the exploration of parton densities in nuclei in a
broad ($x$, $Q^2$) kinematic range and the search for the possible onset of
parton saturation. In order to address these scientific goals, high-luminosity
Pb-Pb and p-Pb programmes are considered as priorities for Runs 3 and 4,
complemented by high-multiplicity studies in pp collisions and a short run with
oxygen ions. High-luminosity runs with intermediate-mass nuclei, for example Ar
or Kr, are considered as an appealing case for extending the heavy-ion
programme at the LHC beyond Run 4. The potential of the High-Energy LHC to
probe QCD matter with newly-available observables, at twice larger
center-of-mass energies than the LHC, is investigated.

instance, optical vortices having a structured phase are nowadays routinely
generated and exploited for a range of applications. While the light-matter
interaction with optical vortices is meanwhile well studied, the distinctive
features of the interaction of quantum matter with vector beams, meaning fields
with spatially inhomogeneous polarization states, are still to be explored in
full detail, which is done here. We analyze the response of atomic and low
dimensional quantum structures to irradiation with radially or azimuthally
polarized cylindrical vector beams. Striking differences to vortex beams are
found: Radially polarized vector beams drive radially breathing charge-density
oscillations via electric-type quantum transitions. Azimuthally polarized
vector beams do not affect the charge at all but trigger, via a magnetic vector
potential a dynamic Aharonov-Bohm effect, meaning a vector-potential driven
oscillating magnetic moment. In contrast to vortex beams, no unidirectional
currents are generated. Atoms driven by a radially polarized vector beam
exhibit angular momentum conserving quadrupole transitions tunable by a static
magnetic field, while when excited with azimuthally polarized beam different
final-state magnetic sublevels can be accessed.

former, we observe a radio flare with a steep radio spectrum, possibly caused
by interactions between discrete ejecta colliding with the pre-existing jet or
the surrounding medium. During the X-ray re-brightening, we observe the radio
jet turning on and off within days. Surprisingly, this re-establishing jet is
as bright in radio as at the peak of the super-Eddington giant outburst,
despite more than two orders of magnitude lower X-ray luminosity. In addition,
the jet is only observed when the X-ray luminosity exceeds approximately
$2\times 10^{36} (D/5\rm kpc)^2$ erg/s. We discuss how such an X-ray threshold
for jet launching might be related to the presence of a magnetic centrifugal
barrier at lower mass accretion rates. We also discuss the implications of our

layer designed to discard some information of the network, thus forcing the
system to focus on relevant input. This is done using a new activation function
to discard data. The added layer trains the neural network to filter-out
usually-irrelevant parts of its input. Our performance evaluation shows that
Spartan Networks have a slightly lower precision but report a higher robustness

field geometry perpendicular to the disk in the hot dust emission. For M82 the

perpendicular to the disk in the nuclear region, but closer to parallel to the

polar outflow, dragging the field along, from a region $\sim 700$~pc in
diameter that has entrained some of the gas and dust, creating a vertical field
geometry seen mostly in the hotter $(53~\mu \rm{m})$ dust emission. This
outflow sits within a larger disk with a more typical planar geometry that more
strongly contributes to the cooler $(154~\mu \rm{m})$ dust emission. For NGC
253, the polarization at $89~\mu \rm{m}$ is dominated by a planar geometry in
the tilted disk, with weak indication of a vertical geometry above and below
the plane from the nucleus. The polarization observations of NGC 253 at $53~\mu

various areas due to their agility and versatility, which have attracted
significant attention from both the academia and industry in recent years. As
an integration of the embedded systems with communication devices, computation
capabilities and control modules, the UAV network could build a closed loop
from data perceiving, information exchanging, decision making to the final
execution, which tightly integrates the cyber processes into the physical
devices. Therefore, the UAV network could be considered as a cyber physical
system (CPS). Revealing the coupling effects among the three interacted
components in this CPS system, i.e., communication, computation and control, is
envisioned as the key to properly utilize all the available resources and hence
improve the performance of the UAV networks. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive survey on the UAV networks from a CPS perspective. Firstly, we
respectively research the basics and advances with respect to the three CPS
components in the UAV networks. Then we look inside to investigate how these
components contribute to the system performance by classifying the UAV networks
into three hierarchies, i.e., the cell level, the system level, and the system
of system level. Further, the coupling effects among these CPS components are
explicitly illustrated, which could be enlightening to deal with the challenges
in each individual aspect. New research directions and open issues are
discussed at the end of this survey. With this intensive literature review, we
try to provide a novel insight into the state-of-the-art in the UAV networks.

postulate that gravity is diluted compared to the other fundamental forces

models are of high experimental interest because they predict massive spin-2
particles ($Y_{2}$) potentially detectable by collider experiments, searches at
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have thus far produced no significant evidence
for their existence. This work considers a hypothetical physics scenario where
low coupling strengths between the $Y_{2}$ and quarks/gluons is the underlying
reason behind the null $Y_{2}$ search results at the LHC, which have mainly
relied on Drell-Yan and gluon-gluon fusion production mechanisms. The focus of
this paper is a feasibility study to search for $Y_{2}$ particles using vector
boson fusion (VBF) processes at the LHC. In the context of an effective field
theory approach with varying couplings $\kappa_{V}$ between $Y_{2}$ and the
weak bosons of the SM, we consider the $Y_{2}\to\gamma\gamma$ decay mode to
show that the requirement of a diphoton pair combined with two high $p_{T}$
forward jets with large dijet mass and with large separation in pseudorapidity
can significantly reduce the SM backgrounds. Assuming proton-proton collisions
at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, we present the total VBF production cross sections,
$Y_{2}$ decay widths, and $Y_{2}\to\gamma\gamma$ branching ratios as a function
of $m(Y_{2})$, considering universal and non-universal couplings to the SM
particles. The unitarity-violating phase space is described. The proposed VBF
$Y_{2}\to\gamma\gamma$ search is expected to achieve a discovery reach with
signal significance greater than 5$\sigma$ for $Y_{2}$ masses up to 4.4 TeV and
$\kappa_{V}$ couplings down to 0.5.

algorithms. We study protocols for convex optimization which provably leak very
little about the individual data points that constitute the loss function.
Specifically, we consider differentially private algorithms that operate in the
local model, where each data record is stored on a separate user device and
randomization is performed locally by those devices. We give new protocols for
\emph{noninteractive} LDP convex optimization---i.e., protocols that require
only a single randomized report from each user to an untrusted aggregator.
  We study our algorithms' performance with respect to expected loss---either
over the data set at hand (empirical risk) or a larger population from which
our data set is assumed to be drawn. Our error bounds depend on the form of
individuals' contribution to the expected loss. For the case of
\emph{generalized linear losses} (such as hinge and logistic losses), we give
an LDP algorithm whose sample complexity is only linear in the dimensionality
$p$ and quasipolynomial in other terms (the privacy parameters $\epsilon$ and
$\delta$, and the desired excess risk $\alpha$). This is the first algorithm
for nonsmooth losses with sub-exponential dependence on $p$.
  For the Euclidean median problem, where the loss is given by the Euclidean
distance to a given data point, we give a protocol whose sample complexity
grows quasipolynomially in $p$. This is the first protocol with sub-exponential
dependence on $p$ for a loss that is not a generalized linear loss .
  Our result for the hinge loss is based on a technique, dubbed polynomial of
inner product approximation, which may be applicable to other problems. Our
results for generalized linear losses and the Euclidean median are based on new
reductions to the case of hinge loss.

dominance for the static $Q\bar Q$ system in lattice QCD with various spacing
$a$ at $\beta$=5.8-6.4 and various size $L^3$x$L_t$. For large physical-volume
lattices with $La \ge$ 2fm, we find perfect Abelian dominance of the string

physical-volume lattices: ($\beta$,$L^3$x$L_t$)=(5.8,$16^3$x32) and
(6.0,$20^3$x32). For all the distances, the static 3Q potential is found to be
well described by the Y-Ansatz: two-body Coulomb term plus three-body Y-type
linear term $\sigma L_{min}$, where $L_{min}$ is the minimum flux-tube length
connecting the three quarks. We find perfect Abelian dominance of the string
tension also for the 3Q systems: $\sigma^{Abel}_{3Q}\simeq \sigma_{3Q} \simeq
\sigma$. Finally, we accurately investigate monopole dominance in SU(3) lattice
QCD at $\beta$=5.8 on $16^3$x32 with 2,000 gauge configurations.
Abelian-projected QCD in the MA gauge has not only the color-electric current
$j^\mu$ but also the color-magnetic monopole current $k^\mu$, which
topologically appears. By the Hodge decomposition, the Abelian-projected QCD
system can be divided into the monopole part ($k_\mu \ne 0$, $j_\mu=0$) and the
photon part ($j_\mu \ne 0$, $k_\mu=0$). We find monopole dominance of the
string tension for $Q\bar Q$ and 3Q systems: $\sigma_{Mo}\simeq 0.92\sigma$.
While the photon part has almost no confining force, the monopole part almost
keeps the confining force.

makes it easy to explicitly specify model constraints through conditional
independence properties, while deep learning makes it possible to parameterize
these conditional likelihoods with powerful function approximators. While these
""deep latent variable"" models provide a rich, flexible framework for modeling
many real-world phenomena, difficulties exist: deep parameterizations of
conditional likelihoods usually make posterior inference intractable, and
latent variable objectives often complicate backpropagation by introducing
points of non-differentiability. This tutorial explores these issues in depth
through the lens of variational inference.

soft harmonic disks in two dimensions we determine the thermal jamming
transition. To be specific, we study whether the ground state of the system
where the particle do not overlap can be reached within a reasonable time.
Starting with random initial configurations, the energy landscape is probed by
energy minimization steps as in case of athermal jamming and in addition steps
where an energy barrier can be crossed with a small but non-zero probability.
For random initial conditions we find that as a function of packing fraction
the thermal jamming transition, i.e. the transition from a state where all
overlaps can be removed to an effectively non-ergodic state where one cannot
get rid of the overlaps, occurs at a packing fraction of $\phi_G=0.74$, which
is smaller than the transition packing fraction of athermal jamming at
$\phi_J=0.842$. Furthermore, we show that the thermal jamming transition is in
the universality class of directed percolation and therefore is fundamentally
different from the athermal jamming transition.

present high resolution spectroscopic follow-up during some dimming events
recorded post-Kepler observations, from ground-based telescopes. We analise
data from the HERMES, HARPS-N and FIES spectrographs to characterise the
stellar atmosphere and to put some constraints on the hypotheses that have
appeared in the literature concerning the occulting elements. The star's
magnetism, if existing, is not extreme. The spots on the surface, if present,
would occupy 0.02% of the area, at most. The chromosphere, irrespective of the
epoch of observation, is hotter than the values expected from radiative
equilibrium, meaning that the star has some degree of activity. We find no
clear evidence of the interstellar medium nor exocoments being responsible for
the dimmings of the light curve. However, we detect at 1-2 sigma level, a
decrease of the radial velocity of the star during the first dip recorded after
the \emph{\emph{Kepler}} observations. We claim the presence of an optically
thick object with likely inclined and high impact parameter orbits that
produces the observed Rossiter-McLaughlin effect.

the transition from a fluid where overlaps between particles can only occur for

transition, we explore the energy landscape of the system in a similar way as
it is done for the determination of the athermal or thermal jamming transition.
Note that for zero temperature the competition of particles that attach to
existing clusters and particles that detach due to thermal effects does not
arise. Therefore, here we do not study such a competition because we consider
systems at small or zero energy. Instead, we explore at which packing fractions
and what activities cluster formation can occur at all. In case of an athermal
system the transition between systems where no clusters develop at all and
systems where stable clusters are found is a first order transition for packing
fractions below 0.55 while the transition is continuous in case of larger
packing fractions. In case of thermal systems the transition is continuous
everywhere. While our approach does not deal with the real dynamics of the
system, it reveals the nature of the clustering transition and it enables a
deeper insight in the consequences of thermal fluctuations and the relation of
the clustering transition to jamming. Though Brownian timescales diverge in
athermal systems, the activity that we consider can be compared to the active
velocity in other simulations if the later is measured in units of the particle

applications. The immersed boundary(IB) method is a widely recognized and
effective modeling paradigm for simulating fluid-structure interaction(FSI) in
such systems, but a difficulty of the IB formulation is that the pressure and
viscous stress are generally discontinuous at the interface. The conventional
IB method regularizes these discontinuities, which typically yields low-order
accuracy at these interfaces. The immersed interface method(IIM) is an IB-like
approach to FSI that sharply imposes stress jump conditions, enabling
higher-order accuracy, but prior applications of the IIM have been largely
restricted to methods that rely on smooth representations of the interface
geometry. This paper introduces an IIM that uses only a C0 representation of
the interface,such as those provided by standard nodal Lagrangian FE methods.
Verification examples for models with prescribed motion demonstrate that the
method sharply resolves stress discontinuities along the IB while avoiding the
need for analytic information of the interface geometry. We demonstrate that
only the lowest-order jump conditions for the pressure and velocity gradient
are required to realize global 2nd-order accuracy. Specifically,we show
2nd-order global convergence rate along with nearly 2nd-order local convergence
in the Eulerian velocity, and between 1st-and 2nd-order global convergence
rates along with 1st-order local convergence for the Eulerian pressure. We also
show 2nd-order local convergence in the interfacial displacement and velocity
along with 1st-order local convergence in the fluid traction. As a
demonstration of the method's ability to tackle complex geometries,this
approach is also used to simulate flow in an anatomical model of the inferior
vena cava.

which slow roll inflation can arise when the inflaton is the same scalar field
that is responsible for the bounce in Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC). We find
that the requirement that the energy density of the field is fixed at the
bounce having to match a critical density has important consequences for its
future evolution. For a generic potential with a minimum, we find different
scenarios depending on the initial velocity of the field and whether it begins
life in a kinetic or potential energy dominated regime. For chaotic potentials
that start in a kinetic dominated regime, we find an initial phase of
superinflation independent of the shape of the potential followed by a damping
phase which slows the inflaton down, forcing it to turnaround and naturally
enter a phase of slow-roll inflation. If we begin in a potential energy
dominated regime, then the field undergoes a period where the corrections
present in LQC damp its evolution once again forcing it to turnaround and enter
a phase of slow roll inflation. On the other hand we show for the Starobinsky
potential that inflation never occurs when we begin in a potential dominated
regime. In fact traditional Starobinsky inflation has to start in a kinetic
energy dominated regime, with corresponding tighter constraints on the initial
value of the field for successful inflation than in the conventional case.
Comparing our analytic results to published numerical ones, we find remarkable
agreement especially when we consider the different epochs that are involved.
In particular the values of key observables obtained from the two approaches
are in excellent agreement, opening up the possibility of obtaining analytic
results for the evolution of the density perturbations in these models.

traumatic aortic rupture in car accidents, particularly on the role of the
inertial body force experienced by the blood due to the abrupt deceleration.
The isolated influence of such body forces acting on even simple fluid flows is
a fundamental problem in fluid dynamics that has not been thoroughly
investigated. This study numerically investigates the fundamental physical
problem, where the pulsatile flow in a straight circular pipe is subjected to a
transverse body force on a localized volume of fluid. The body force is applied
as a brief rectangular impulse in three distinct cases, namely during the
accelerating, peak, and decelerating phases of the pulsatile flow. A
dimensionless number, termed the degree of influence of the body force
({\Psi}), is devised to quantify the relative strength of the body force over
the flow inertia. The impact induces counter-rotating cross-stream vortices at
the boundaries of the forced section accompanied by complex secondary flow
structures. This secondary flow is found to develop slowest for an impact
occurring during an accelerating flow and fastest during a decelerating flow.
The peak skewness of the velocity field, however, occurred at successively
later times for the three respective cases. After the impact, these secondary
flows act to restore the unforced state and such dominant spatial structures
are revealed by proper orthogonal decomposition of the velocity field. This
work presents a new class of problems that requires further theoretical and
experimental investigation.

scale factor and $\delta (a)$ quantifies the interaction rate. By assuming the

analyses show that the non-interacting scenario is consistent with the
observations while the interaction is not strictly ruled out. We reconstruct in
the following way. We start with the first two terms of $\delta (a)$ above and
constrain $\delta_0$, $\delta_1$. Then we consider up to the second order terms
in $\delta (a)$ but fix $\delta_0$, $\delta_1$ to their constrained values and
constrain $\delta_2$; similarly we constrain $\delta_3$, and finally we
constrain $(\delta_0, \delta_1, \delta_1, \delta_3)$ by keeping all of them to
be free as a generalized case. Our reconstruction technique shows that the
constraints on $\delta_2$ (fixing $\delta_0$ and $\delta_1$) and $\delta_3$
(fixing $\delta_0$, $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$) are almost zero for any
interaction model and thus the effective scenario is well described by the
linear parametrization $\delta (a)\simeq \delta_{0}+\delta _{1}(1-a)$.
Additionally, a strong negative correlation between $\delta_0$, $\delta_1$ is

sparsely sampled light fields obtained using a synchronized camera array. In
our method, the source images are over-segmented into non-overlapping compact
superpixels that are used as basic data units for depth estimation and
refinement. Superpixel representation provides a desirable reduction in the
computational cost while preserving the image geometry with respect to the
object contours. Each superpixel is modeled as a plane in the image space,
allowing depth values to vary smoothly within the superpixel area. Initial
depth maps, which are obtained by plane sweeping, are iteratively refined by
propagating good correspondences within an image. To ensure the fast
convergence of the iterative optimization process, we employ a highly parallel
propagation scheme that operates on all the superpixels of all the images at
once, making full use of the parallel graphics hardware. A few optimization
iterations of the energy function incorporating superpixel-wise smoothness and
geometric consistency constraints allows to recover depth with high accuracy in
textured and textureless regions as well as areas with occlusions, producing
dense globally consistent depth maps. We demonstrate that while the depth
reconstruction takes about a second per full high-definition view, the accuracy
of the obtained depth maps is comparable with the state-of-the-art results.

glare and residual salts. A deep learning model based on convolutional neural

challenges for improved classification accuracy. In the proposed approach we
introduce the idea of applying an existing CNN model that has been pre-trained
using millions of images with proven high recognition accuracy. The model is
extended with two additional fully-connected layers of neurons for learning the
specific features of the RSC images. The whole model is then trained with a low
learning rate for fine-tuning by using a small set of RSC images. Results show
that the proposed model has the highest classification performance in

with different training dataset sizes is also analyzed, showing the potential
of achieving much higher accuracy with a larger training dataset.

slightly blue and arbitrarily close to scale invariance. The only difference
between the tensor and scalar spectra is the coupling constant with an

vectors. As a result the tilt of the spectra are the same. For the nearly scale
invariant case, the momentum integration gives the same leading contribution.
Hence, $r\simeq 1/9$ where the deviation from this value is controlled by the
deviation from scale invariance, and is not in agreement with CMB observations.
Deviating considerably from near scale invariance, and considering a bluer tilt

relieve resource-limited mobile devices from computation-intensive tasks, which
enables devices to offload workloads to nearby MEC servers and improve the
quality of computation experience. Nevertheless, by considering a MEC system
consisting of multiple mobile users with stochastic task arrivals and wireless
channels in this paper, the design of computation offloading policies is
challenging to minimize the long-term average computation cost in terms of
power consumption and buffering delay. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
based decentralized dynamic computation offloading strategy is investigated to
build a scalable MEC system with limited feedback. Specifically, a continuous
action space-based DRL approach named deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)
is adopted to learn efficient computation offloading policies independently at
each mobile user. Thus, powers of both local execution and task offloading can
be adaptively allocated by the learned policies from each user's local
observation of the MEC system. Numerical results are illustrated to demonstrate
that efficient policies can be learned at each user, and performance of the
proposed DDPG based decentralized strategy outperforms the conventional deep
Q-network (DQN) based discrete power control strategy and some other greedy
strategies with reduced computation cost. Besides, the power-delay tradeoff is
also analyzed for both the DDPG based and DQN based strategies.

to achieve desired distortion performance. However, existing studies on this
issue assume error-free digital transmission, which is not valid for fading
channels. With time-varying channel fading, the exact channel state information
is not available at the transmitter. Thus, random outage and resulting digital
distortion cannot be ignored. Moreover, rate allocation should be considered in
resource allocation, since it not only determines the amount of information for
digital transmission and that for analog transmission, but also affects the
outage probability. Based on above observations, in this paper, we attempt to
perform joint rate and resource allocation strategies to optimize system
distortion in HDA systems over fading channels. Consider a bandwidth expansion
scenario where a memoryless Gaussian source is transmitted in an HDA system
with the entropy-constrained scalar quantizer (ECSQ). Firstly, we formulate the
joint allocation problem as an expected system distortion minimization problem
where both analog and digital distortion are considered. Then, in the limit of
low outage probability, we decompose the problem into two coupled sub-problems
based on the block coordinate descent method, and propose an iterative gradient
algorithm to approach the optimal solution. Furthermore, we extend our work to
the multivariate Gaussian source scenario where a two-stage fast algorithm
integrating rounding and greedy strategies is proposed to optimize the joint
rate and resource allocation problem. Finally, simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed algorithms can achieve up to 2.3dB gains in terms of
signal-to-distortion ratio over existing schemes under the single Gaussian
source scenario, and up to 3.5dB gains under the multivariate Gaussian source
scenario.

privacy and security concerns on their information flow are raised. Given a
critical system that may leak confidential information, the problem consists of
verifying and also enforcing opacity by designing supervisors, to conceal
confidential information from unauthorized persons. To find out what the
intruder sees, it is required to construct an observer of the system. In this
paper, we consider incremental observer generation of modular systems, for
verification and enforcement of current state opacity. The synchronization of
the subsystems generate a large state space. Moreover, the observer generation
with exponential complexity adds even larger state space. To tackle the
complexity problem, we prove that observer generation can be done locally
before synchronizing the subsystems. The incremental local observer generation
along with an abstraction method lead to a significant state space reduction
compared to traditional monolithic methods. The existence of shared
unobservable events is also considered in the incremental approach. Moreover,
we present an illustrative example, where the results of verification and

envisioned to have storage devices to locally serve requests for reusable and
popular contents by \emph{caching} them at the edge of the network, close to
the end users. The ultimate goal is to shift part of the predictable load on
the back-haul links, from on-peak to off-peak periods, contributing to a better
overall network performance and service experience. To enable the SBs with
efficient \textit{fetch-cache} decision-making schemes operating in dynamic
settings, this paper introduces simple but flexible generic time-varying
fetching and caching costs, which are then used to formulate a constrained
minimization of the aggregate cost across files and time. Since caching
decisions per time slot influence the content availability in future slots, the
novel formulation for optimal fetch-cache decisions falls into the class of
dynamic programming. Under this generic formulation, first by considering
stationary distributions for the costs and file popularities, an efficient
reinforcement learning-based solver known as value iteration algorithm can be
used to solve the emerging optimization problem. Later, it is shown that
practical limitations on cache capacity can be handled using a particular
instance of the generic dynamic pricing formulation. Under this setting, to
provide a light-weight online solver for the corresponding optimization, the
well-known reinforcement learning algorithm, $Q$-learning, is employed to find
optimal fetch-cache decisions. Numerical tests corroborating the merits of the
proposed approach wrap up the paper.

particularly important in fracture reservoir characterization. Fractured
reservoirs are azimuthal anisotropic with respect to elastic-wave propagation.
In this work we introduce an ellipsoidal approximation for monoclinic media
that is able to characterized fractured media near the vertical axis of
symmetry. The procedure is basically two-fold. First, we estimate phase
velocities near the vertical axis using an expansion of the slowness. Secondly,
the phase velocities are used to build the group velocities near the vertical
axis. We particularly establish that for monoclinic media ellipsoidal functions
in the phase domain correspond to ellipsoidal functions in the group domain.
Finally, in order to validate the approximation, the $P$, $S_1$ and $S_2$
ellipsoidal impulse responses are compared for different polar angles with the
exact responses obtained by solving numerically the eigenvectors problem from
the Christoffel equation. Examples are shown for monoclinic media, and are
validated showing results from a previous work for orthorhombic media. The
whole procedure is valid for homogeneous media.

errors benefits both wind farms (WFs) and independent system operators (ISOs).
Establishing the joint probability distribution of wind power and the
corresponding forecast data of spatially correlated WFs is the foundation for
deriving the conditional probability distribution. Traditional parameter
estimation methods for probability distributions require the collection of
historical data of all WFs. However, in the context of multi-regional
interconnected grids, neither regional ISOs nor WFs can collect the raw data of
WFs in other regions due to privacy or competition considerations. Therefore,
based on the Gaussian mixture model, this paper first proposes a
privacy-preserving distributed expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate
the parameters of the joint probability distribution. This algorithm consists
of two original methods: (1) a privacy-preserving distributed summation
algorithm and (2) a privacy-preserving distributed inner product algorithm.
Then, we derive each WF's conditional probability distribution of forecast
error from the joint one. By the proposed algorithms, WFs only need local
calculations and privacy-preserving neighboring communications to achieve the
whole parameter estimation. These algorithms are verified using the wind
integration data set published by the NREL.

conditions based on distance from cluster centers and value of indeterminacy,
are considered for each data point. In the third step, the proposed cost
function is minimized by gradient descend methods. Data points are clustered
based on their membership degrees. Outlier points are assigned to noise
cluster; and boundary points are assigned to main clusters with almost same
membership degrees. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, three
types of datasets including diamond, UCI and image datasets are used. Results
demonstrate that the proposed cost function handles boundary and outlier points
with more accurate membership degrees and outperforms existing state of the art
clustering methods in all datasets.

intelligence-based technologies with the extraordinary increases in
computational power and data volumes. A central challenge in manufacturing
sector lies in the requirement of a general framework to ensure satisfied
diagnosis and monitoring performances in different manufacturing applications.
Here we propose a general data-driven, end-to-end framework for the monitoring
of manufacturing systems. This framework, derived from deep learning
techniques, evaluates fused sensory measurements to detect and even predict
faults and wearing conditions. This work exploits the predictive power of deep
learning to automatically extract hidden degradation features from noisy,
time-course data. We have experimented the proposed framework on ten
representative datasets drawn from a wide variety of manufacturing
applications. Results reveal that the framework performs well in examined
benchmark applications and can be applied in diverse contexts, indicating its
potential use as a critical corner stone in smart manufacturing.

retrospective data on the pool of donor/recipient incompatible and desensitized
pairs at the Padua University Hospital, the largest center for living donor
kidney transplants in Italy. The experiments show a remarkable improvement on
the number of patients with incompatible donor who could be transplanted, a
decrease in the number of desensitization procedures, and an increase in the
number of UT patients (that is, patients unlikely to be transplanted for
immunological reasons) in the waiting list who could receive an organ.

manually, which is a tedious task that requires specific skills. In this paper,
we present a novel method for performing CFD directly on scanned 3D point
clouds. The proposed method builds an anisotropic volumetric tetrahedral mesh
adapted around a point-sampled surface, without an explicit surface
reconstruction step. The surface is represented by a new extended implicit
moving least squares (EIMLS) scalar representation that extends the definition
of the function to the entire computational domain, which makes it possible for
use in immersed boundary flow simulations. The workflow we present allows us to
compute flows around point-sampled geometries automatically. It also gives a
better control of the precision around the surface with a limited number of
computational nodes, which is a critical issue in CFD.

special hosts gotten great focus. Mining super point at the edge of a network
is the foundation of many network research fields. In this paper, we proposed
the most memory efficient super points detection scheme. This scheme contains a
super points reconstruction algorithm called short estimator and a super points
filter algorithm called long estimator. Short estimator gives a super points
candidate list using thousands of bytes memory and long estimator improves the
accuracy of detection result using millions of bytes memory. Combining short
estimator and long estimator, our scheme acquires the highest accuracy using
the smallest memory than other algorithms. There is no data conflict and
floating operation in our scheme. This ensures that our scheme is suitable for
parallel running and we deploy our scheme on a common GPU to accelerate
processing speed. We also describe how to extend our algorithm to sliding time.
Experiments on several real-world core network traffics show that our algorithm
acquires the highest accuracy with only consuming littler than one-fifth memory
of other algorithms.

  volatile organic compounds","26 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables",,,,"physics.app-ph physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a known photocatalyst with a capability of
decomposing organic substance. However, the photocatalysis of the pure TiO2 is
not effective for the indoor environment due to a lack of the ultraviolet
irradiation inside the building. Doping TiO2 with substance such as C, N or
metal can extend the threshold of the absorption spectrum to the visible
spectrum region. Thus, doped-TiO2 is able to decompose volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) under an indoor environment. To date, most experimental work
reported on photocatalytic kinetics were conducted inside small-scale devices.
The performance of air purification function under the actual indoor
application scenery need to be further clarified. For this purpose, it is
crucial to predict the performance of autogenous air quality improvements by
visible light driven photocatalyst for the actual applications. This work has
developed a model to evaluate the performance of functional coating with
photocatalyst in removing VOCs. Factors such as the effects of coating designs
and indoor ambient conditions on the air purification efficiency were studied.
This work demonstrates that doped-TiO2 photocatalytic coating is effective to
improve the indoor air quality.
