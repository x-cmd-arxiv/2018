  Nets","9 pages",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For optimal placement and orchestration of network services, it is crucial
that their structure and semantics are specified clearly and comprehensively
and are available to an orchestrator. Existing specification approaches are
either ambiguous or miss important aspects regarding the behavior of virtual
network functions (VNFs) forming a service. We propose to formally and
unambiguously specify the behavior of these functions and services using
Queuing Petri Nets (QPNs). QPNs are an established method that allows to
express queuing, synchronization, stochastically distributed processing delays,
and changing traffic volume and characteristics at each VNF. With QPNs,
multiple VNFs can be connected to complete network services in any structure,
even specifying bidirectional network services containing loops.
  We propose a tool-based workflow that supports the specification of network
services and the automatic generation of corresponding simulation code to
enable an in-depth analysis of their behavior and performance. In a case study,
we show how developers can benefit from analysis insights, e.g., to anticipate
the impact of different service configurations. We also discuss how management
and orchestration systems can benefit from our clear and comprehensive
specification approach and its extensive analysis possibilities, leading to
better placement of VNFs and improved Quality of Service.

connected car market, pushing for the digital transformation of the sector by
exploiting recent Information and Communication Technology (ICT) progress. As
ICT developments continue, it is expected that the technology advancements will
be able to fulfill the sophisticated requirements for vehicular use cases, such
as low latency and reliable communications for safety, high computing power to
process large amount of sensed data, and increased bandwidth for on-board
infotainment.
  The aforementioned requirements have received significant focus during the
ongoing definition of the 3GPP 5G mobile standards, where there has been a
drive to facilitate vertical industries such as automotive, in addition to
providing the core aspects of the communication infrastructure. Of the
technology enablers for 5G, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) can be considered
essential. That is, a cloud environment located at the edge of the network, in
proximity of the end-users and coupled with the service provider's network
infrastructure. Even before 5G is rolled out, current mobile networks can
already target support for these challenging use cases using MEC technology.
This is because MEC is able to fulfill low latency and high bandwidth
requirements, and, in addition, it lends itself to be deployed at the vertical
industrial sector premises such as road infrastructure, air/sea ports, smart
factories, etc., thus, bringing computing power where it is needed most.
  This work showcases the automotive use cases that are relevant for MEC,
providing insights into the technologies specified and investigated by the ETSI
MEC Industry Specification Group (ISG), who were the pioneer in creating a
standardized computing platform for advanced mobile networks with regards to
network edge related use cases.

effective diffusion constant, whereas an exponential contraction neutralizes
the diffusive behavior entirely and leads to a stationary state. Furthermore,

upscaling the experimental complexity in quantum networking, two-photon
interference (TPI) of remote non-classical emitters in the low-loss telecom

several experiments have been conducted, e.g., using trapped atoms
[Beugnon2006], ions [Maunz2007], NV-centers [Bernien2012, Sipahigil2012],

quantum frequency conversion [Zaske2012, Ates2012, Kambs2016] as precise and
stable mechanism to erase the frequency difference between independent
emitters. On resonance, a TPI-visibility of (29+-3)% has been observed, being
only limited by spectral diffusion processes of the individual QDs
[Robinson2000, Kuhlmann2015]. Up to 2-km of additional fiber channel has been
introduced in both or individual signal paths with no influence on
TPI-visibility, proving negligible photon wave-packet distortion. The present

space. The utility is chosen to represent the aim of the experiment and its
expectation is taken with respect to all unknowns: responses, parameters and/or
models. Although straightforward in principle, there are several challenges to
finding Bayesian designs in practice. Firstly, the utility and expected utility
are rarely available in closed form and require approximation. Secondly, the
design space can be of high-dimensionality. In the case of intractable
likelihood models, these problems are compounded by the fact that the
likelihood function, whose evaluation is required to approximate the expected
utility, is not available in closed form. A strategy is proposed to find
Bayesian designs for intractable likelihood models. It relies on the
development of an automatic, auxiliary modelling approach, using multivariate
Gaussian process emulators, to approximate the likelihood function. This is
then combined with a copula-based approach to approximate the marginal
likelihood (a quantity commonly required to evaluate many utility functions).
These approximations are demonstrated on examples of stochastic process models
involving experimental aims of both parameter estimation and model comparison.

of the hydrogen bonded protons in ice VII already at significantly lower
pressures than previously expected. A pronounced tunneling mode was found to be
present up to the highest pressures of 90 GPa, well into the stability field of
ice X, where NQEs are not anticipated in a fully symmetrized H-bond network. We
found two distinct transitions in the NMR shift data at about 20 GPa and 75 GPa
attributed to the step-wise symmetrization of the H-bond (HB), with
high-barrier H-Bonds (HBHB) to low-barrier H-bonds (LBHB) and LBHB to symmetric
H-bonds (SHB) respectively. These transitions could have major implication on
the physical properties of high-pressure ices and planetary interior models.

the high field performance of Nb$_3$Sn must be improved, but champion J$_c$
values have remained static for the last 10 years. Making the A15 phase
stoichiometric and enhancing the upper critical field H$_{c2}$ by Ti or Ta
dopants are the standard strategies for enhancing high field performance but
detailed recent studies show that even the best modern wires have broad
composition ranges. To assess whether further improvement might be possible, we
employed EXAFS to determine the lattice site location of dopants in modern
high-performance Nb$_3$Sn strands with J$_c$ values amongst the best so far
achieved. Although Ti and Ta primarily occupy the Nb sites in the A15
structure, we also find significant Ta occupancy on the Sn site. These findings
indicate that the best performing Ti-doped stand is strongly sub-stoichiometric
in Sn and that antisite disorder likely explains its high average H$_{c2}$
behavior. These new results suggest an important role for dopant and antisite
disorder in minimizing superconducting property distributions and maximizing
high field J$_c$ properties.

desirable to phase out large cinema projection systems based on standard xenon
lamps in favor of laser based projection devices. Lasers provide longer
lifetime and wider color gamut of light output. But the high degree of
coherence of these sources also lead to the formation of granular structures,
usually known as speckle. When an imaging system is involved, as in the cinema
projection case because of the capacity of the human eye to form an image of
the screen, we speak about subjective speckle. In order to remove this spatial
random pattern, different methods have been studied as temporal and/or spatial
coherence reduction. But most of them can't be used in the context of cinema
projection because they don't respect the cinematography projection standard.
In our work, we have studied the possibility to reduce the subjective speckle
either by changing the coherence of the light source or by studying the
influence of the different elements constituting the projection display in the
conditions imposed by cinematography industry. Thanks to a lasers array formed
by N independant semiconductor lasers, we have measured the evolution of the
subjective speckle contrast in function of the number of sources. The resulting
contrast discreases as a square root function and reach a saturation level when
a light pipe is used. This behavior is directly due to the light pipe which
limit at its output the spatial coherence of the source. Futhermore, in a
different configuration, we have studied the influence of diffusers and the
magnification of the projector zoom. It has been demonstrated that
magnification plays an important role on the speckle formation because it
increases the coherence length determined by the light pipe. On the contrary,
the diffusers placed before the light pipe doesn't change the subjective
speckle.

were conducted. Hypotheses about the mechanics and effectiveness of these
campaigns were established and evaluated.
  Findings: The campaigns contained a combined 1,856,316 microtasks, 89.7% of
which were connected to online promotion. Techniques for search engine
manipulation, comment-generating in the scale of tens of thousands, online vote
manipulation, mass account creation, methods for covering tracks were
discovered. The article presents an assessment of the effectiveness of such
campaigns as well as various security challenges created by these campaigns.
  Research limitations: The observed campaigns form only a small portion of the
overall ""black market"". This is due to invite-only campaigns and the presence
of alternative, unobservable platforms.
  Practical implications: The findings of this article could be input for
detecting and avoiding such online campaigns.
  Social implications: The findings show that in some conditions tremendous
levels of manipulation of an online discourse can be achieved with a limited
budget.
  Originality: While there is related work on ""follower factories"" and
""click/troll farms"", those entities offer complete ""solutions"" and their
techniques are rather opaque. By investigating a crowdsourcing platform, this
research unveils the underlying mechanics and organization of such campaigns.
The research is based on a uniquely large number of observations. Small, cheap
campaigns, the manipulation of less significant platforms is also included,
while the related work tends to focus on mass, politically motivated efforts.

are transported in the outer portion of the Sun. The resulting overturning
motions are also the primary energy source for the solar magnetic field. An
accurate solar dynamo model therefore requires a complete description of the
convective motions, but these motions remain poorly understood. Studying
stellar convection numerically remains challenging; it occurs within a
parameter regime that is extreme by computational standards. The fluid
properties of the convection zone are characterized in part by the Prandtl
number $\mathrm{Pr}=\nu/\kappa$, where $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity and
$\kappa$ is the thermal diffusion; in stars, $\mathrm{Pr}$ is extremely low,
$\mathrm{Pr}\approx 10^{-7}$. The influence of $\mathrm{Pr}$ on the convective
motions at the heart of the dynamo is not well understood since most numerical
studies are limited to using $\mathrm{Pr}\approx1$. We systematically vary
$\mathrm{Pr}$ and the degree of thermal forcing, characterized through a
Rayleigh number, to explore its influence on the convective dynamics. For
sufficiently large thermal driving, the simulations reach a so-called
convective free-fall state where diffusion no longer plays an important role in
the interior dynamics. Simulations with a lower $\mathrm{Pr}$ generate faster
convective flows and broader ranges of scales for equivalent levels of thermal
forcing. Characteristics of the spectral distribution of the velocity remain
largely insensitive to changes in $\mathrm{Pr}$. Importantly, we find that
$\mathrm{Pr}$ plays a key role in determining when the free-fall regime is
reached by controlling the thickness of the thermal boundary layer.

microwave background (CMB) temperature fluctuations, the largest of which is
the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ), the Doppler shift of CMB photons
scattering off moving electrons in ionized bubbles. It has long been known that
in the CMB power spectrum, this imprint of reionization is largely degenerate
with the kSZ signal produced by late-time galaxies and clusters, thus limiting
our ability to constrain reionization. Following Smith & Ferraro (2017), it is
possible to isolate the reionization contribution in a model independent way,
by looking at the large scale modulation of the small scale CMB power spectrum.
In this paper we extend the formalism to use the full shape information of the
small scale power spectrum (rather than just its broadband average), and argue
that this is necessary to break the degeneracy between the optical depth $\tau$
and parameters setting the duration of reionization. In particular, we show
that the next generation of CMB experiments could achieve up to a factor of 3
improvement on the optical depth $\tau$ and at the same time, constrain the
duration of reionization to $\sim$ 25 %. This can help tighten the constrains
on neutrino masses, which will be limited by our knowledge of $\tau$, and shed
light on the physical processes responsible for reionization.

carbon-silicate cycle that acts as a negative feedback mechanism stabilizing
surface temperatures via the intake and outgas of atmospheric carbon. On Earth,
this thermostat is enabled by plate tectonics that sequesters outgassed CO2
back into the mantle via weathering and subduction at convergent margins. Here
we propose a separate tectonic mechanism -- vertical recycling -- that can
serve as the vehicle for CO2 outgassing and sequestration over long timescales.
The mechanism requires continuous tidal heating, which makes it particularly
relevant to planets in the habitable zone of M stars. Dynamical models of this
vertical recycling scenario and stability analysis show that temperate climates
stable over Gy timescales are realized for a variety of initial conditions,
even as the M star dims over time. The magnitude of equilibrium surface
temperatures depends on the interplay of sea weathering and outgassing, which
in turn depends on planetary carbon content, so that planets with lower carbon

great importance for populations, authorities and the
banking/insurance/reinsurance industry. Koch (2017) introduced a notion of
spatial risk measure and a corresponding set of axioms which are well suited to
analyze the risk due to events having a spatial extent, precisely such as
environmental phenomena. The axiom of asymptotic spatial homogeneity is of
particular interest since it allows one to quantify the rate of spatial
diversification when the region under consideration becomes large. In this
paper, we first investigate the general concepts of spatial risk measures and
corresponding axioms further and thoroughly explain the usefulness of this
theory for both actuarial science and practice. Second, in the case of a
general cost field, we give sufficient conditions such that spatial risk
measures associated with expectation, variance, Value-at-Risk as well as
expected shortfall and induced by this cost field satisfy the axioms of
asymptotic spatial homogeneity of order $0$, $-2$, $-1$ and $-1$, respectively.
Last but not least, in the case where the cost field is a function of a
max-stable random field, we provide conditions on both the function and the
max-stable field ensuring the latter properties. Max-stable random fields are
relevant when assessing the risk of extreme events since they appear as a
natural extension of multivariate extreme-value theory to the level of random
fields. Overall, this paper improves our understanding of spatial risk measures
as well as of their properties with respect to the space variable and
generalizes many results obtained in Koch (2017).

the Lipschitz constant is unknown, a simple backtracking linesearch procedure

enhanced due to their dependence on the veto-region size. Since our parton

contaminated observations at low SNR. To this end, this paper uses an idea that
the significant observations are sparse in the time domain to further enhance
the quality of signals as well as the beam selection performance. By exploiting
properties of channel impulse responses and circular convolutions in the time
domain, we can reduce the size of a Toeplitz matrix in deconvolution to
generate periodic true values of coupling coefficients plus random noise
signals. An arithmetic mean of these signals yields refined observations with
minor noise effects and provides more accurate sparse multipath delay
information. As a result, only the refined observations associated with the
estimated multipath delay indices have to be taken into account for the analog

Physics models that give an order one (or larger) increase of photon count in
the RJ tail, which can be tested by existing and upcoming experiments aiming to
detect the cosmological 21 cm emission/absorption signal. This class of models
stipulates the decay of unstable particles to dark photons, $A'$, that have a
small mass, $m_{A'} \sim 10^{-14} - 10^{-9}$ eV, non-vanishing mixing angle
$\epsilon$ with electromagnetism, and energies much smaller than $T_{\rm CMB}$.
The non-thermal number density of dark photons can be many orders of magnitude
above the number density of CMB photons, and even a small probability of $A'\to
A$ oscillations, for values of as small as $\epsilon \sim 10^{-9}$, can
significantly increase the number of RJ photons. In particular, we show that
resonant oscillations of dark photons into regular photons in the interval of
redshifts $20 < z < 1700$ can be invoked as an explanation of the recent
tentative observation of a stronger-than-expected absorption signal of 21 cm

dark matter decays to dark photons, with a lifetime longer than the age of the

late-time optical spectroscopy of the Type Ib explosion SN 2004dk 4684 days (13

reported for a SN at this late stage. Prominent emission features of He, Fe,

evolutionary stages (primary at the end of the central helium burning; at the
bottom of the RGB; and in the helium core burning). The simulations have been
carried out for two values of accuracy on the mass determination (1% and 0.1%).
We found that the fitted age and overshooting efficiency are always biased
towards low values. The underestimation is relevant for a primary in the
central helium burning stage, reaching -8.5% in age and -0.04 (-25% relative
error) in the overshooting parameter $\beta$. In the other scenarios, an
undervaluation of the age by about 4% occurs. A large variability in the fitted
values between simulations was found: for an individual system calibration, the
value of $\beta$ can vary from 0.0 to 0.26. For an error of 0.1% on the masses
the global variability is suppressed by a factor of two. We accounted for a
systematic offset in the effective temperature of the stars by $\pm 150$ K. For
a mass error of 1% $\beta$ is largely biased towards the edges of the explored
range, while for the lower mass uncertainty it is basically unconstrained from
0.0 to 0.2. We evaluated the possibility of individually recovering the $\beta$
value for both stars. We found that this is impossible for a primary near to
central hydrogen exhaustion, while in the other cases the fitted $\beta$ are
consistent, but always biased. Finally, the possibility to distinguish between
models computed with mild overshooting from models with no overshooting
resulted in a reassuring power of 80%. However, the scenario with a primary in

new ICB/QD model predicts that increasing ${Q_f}$ should lead to a shift of
selectivity sequences towards larger ion sizes and charges, a result that
agrees with the present experiments and with earlier work. Comparison of the
model with experimental data provides evidence for an {\it effective charge}
$Q_f^*$ at the SF that is smaller in magnitude than the nominal $Q_f$
corresponding to the charge on the isolated protein residues. Furthermore,
$Q_f^*$ was different for aspartate and glutamate charged rings and also
depended on their position within the SF. It is suggested that protonation of
the residues within the restricted space is an important factor in
significantly reducing the effective charge of the EEEE ring. Values of $Q_f^*$
derived from experiments on the anomalous mole fraction effect (AMFE) agree
well with expectations based on the ICB/QD model and have led to the first
clear demonstration of the expected ICB oscillations in Ca$^{2+}$ conduction as

enabling observations of the diverse properties of a representative number of

far-ultraviolet by the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS), the last spectrograph

spatial information in its 2.5 arcsec diameter circular aperture, and our
objective was to determine the CO production rates from measurements of the CO
Fourth Positive system in the spectral range of 1400 to 1700 A. In the two
brightest comets, nineteen bands of this system were clearly identified. The
water production rates were derived from nearly concurrent observations of the
OH (0,0) band at 3085 A by the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The
derived CO/H2O production rate ratio ranged from ~0.3% for Hartley 2 to ~22%
for Garradd. In addition, strong partially resolved emission features due to
multiplets of S I, centered at 1429 A and 1479 A, and of C I at 1561 A and 1657
A, were observed in all four comets. Weak emission from several lines of the H2
Lyman band system, excited by solar Lyman-alpha and Lyman-beta pumped

the actuators that is based on mechanical resonance, however, limits their use
to a situation where their resonant frequencies are known and unshifted. In
reality, there are many factors that alter the resonant frequency: for example,
manufacturing tolerances, worn mechanical components such as a spring,
nonlinearity in association with different input voltage levels. Here, we
describe a sensorless resonance tracking method that actuates the motor and
automatically detects its unknown damped natural frequency through the
estimation of back electromotive force (EMF) and inner mass movements. We
demonstrate the tracking performance of the proposed method through a series of
experiments. This approach has the potential to control residual vibrations and
then improve vibrotactile feedback, which can potentially be used for
human-computer interaction, cognitive and affective neuroscience research.

thermal fluctuation phenomena among molecules in the vicinity of macroscopic

Most of the material from the impactor's rocky core falls in to the core of the
target. However, for higher angular momentum impacts, significant amounts
become embedded anisotropically as lumps in the ice layer. Furthermore, most of
the impactor's ice and energy is deposited in a hot, high-entropy shell at a
radius of ~3 Earth radii. This could explain Uranus' observed lack of heat flow
from the interior and be relevant for understanding its asymmetric magnetic
field. We verify the results from the single previous study of lower resolution
simulations that an impactor with a mass of at least 2 Earth masses can produce
sufficiently rapid rotation in the post-impact Uranus for a range of angular
momenta. At least 90% of the atmosphere remains bound to the final planet after

range of physical conditions that must be simplified to one, two, or three
components when modeled. Here we investigate the recoverability of physical
conditions from SLEDs produced by galaxy evolution simulations containing a
large dynamical range in physical properties. These simulated SLEDs were
generally fit well by one component of gas whose properties largely resemble or
slightly underestimate the luminosity-weighted properties of the simulations
when clumping due to non-thermal velocity dispersion is taken into account. If
only modeling the first three rotational lines, the median values of the
marginalized parameter distributions better represent the luminosity-weighted
properties of the simulations, but the uncertainties in the fitted parameters
are nearly an order of magnitude, compared to approximately 0.2 dex in the
""best-case"" scenario of a fully sampled SLED through J = 10-9. This study
demonstrates that while common CO SLED modeling techniques cannot reveal the
underlying complexities of the molecular gas, they can distinguish bulk
luminosity-weighted properties that vary with star formation surface densities

Interestingly, unlike in normal inflation, $\omega$ in phantom induced

Nevertheless, most studies present only a single image of their data after a
process of ""self-calibration,"" an iterative procedure where the initial image
and calibration assumptions can significantly influence the final image. We
present a method for efficient interferometric imaging directly using only
closure amplitudes and closure phases, which are immune to station-based
calibration errors. Closure-only imaging provides results that are as
non-committal as possible and allows for reconstructing an image independently
from separate amplitude and phase self-calibration. While closure-only imaging
eliminates some image information (e.g., the total image flux density and the
image centroid), this information can be recovered through a small number of
additional constraints. We demonstrate that closure-only imaging can produce
high fidelity results, even for sparse arrays such as the Event Horizon
Telescope, and that the resulting images are independent of the level of
systematic amplitude error. We apply closure imaging to VLBA and ALMA data and
show that it is capable of matching or exceeding the performance of traditional
self-calibration and CLEAN for these data sets.

one must invariably introduce specific models (e.g., for the star formation) in
order to fully interpret the data. Unfortunately, this tends to render the
analysis compliant to the theory and its assumptions, so consensus is still
somewhat elusive. Nonetheless, the surprisingly early appearance of massive
galaxies challenges the standard model, and the halo mass function estimated
from galaxy surveys at z > 4 appears to be inconsistent with the predictions of
LCDM, giving rise to what has been termed ""The Impossibly Early Galaxy Problem""
by some workers in the field. A simple resolution to this question may not be
forthcoming. The situation with the halos themselves, however, is more
straightforward and, in this paper, we use linear perturbation theory to derive
the halo mass function over the redshift range z < 10 for the R_h=ct universe.
We use this predicted halo distribution to demonstrate that both its dependence
on mass and its very weak dependence on redshift are compatible with the data.
The difficulties with LCDM may eventually be overcome with refinements to the
underlying theory of star formation and galaxy evolution within the halos. For
now, however, we demonstrate that the unexpected early formation of structure
may also simply be due to an incorrect choice of the cosmology, rather than to
yet unknown astrophysical issues associated with the condensation of mass
fluctuations and subsequent galaxy formation.

average. The upper limit of the magnetic field component parallel to the line
of sight is estimated to be B$_\parallel \sim$ 20 $\mu$G. The statistical
behavior of the magnetic vectors shows two preferential directions, almost
perpendicular to each other, which are approximately aligned with the flat
edges of Puppis A. A third, narrow peak oriented perpendicular to the Galactic
plane suggests the existence of an interstellar magnetic field locally aligned
in this direction. There is evidence that the magnetic vectors along the shell

the statistical behavior of the magnetic vectors are compatible with a scenario
where the SNR evolves inside a stellar wind bubble with a box-like morphology,
produced by the interaction of the different stellar winds, one of them
magnetized, launched by the SN progenitor. This scenario can furthermore
explain the morphology of Puppis A, rendering little support to the previously

planet formation, the conglomeration of massive gaseous envelopes is
facilitated by a transient period of rapid accumulation of nebular material.
While the concurrent buildup of angular momentum is expected to leave newly
formed planets spinning at near-breakup velocities, Jupiter and Saturn, as well
as super-Jovian long-period extrasolar planets, are observed to rotate well
below criticality. In this work, we demonstrate that the large luminosity of a
young giant planet simultaneously leads to the generation of a strong planetary
magnetic field, as well as thermal ionization of the circumplanetary disk. The
ensuing magnetic coupling between the planetary interior and the
quasi-Keplerian motion of the disk results in efficient braking of planetary
rotation, with hydrodynamic circulation of gas within the Hill sphere playing
the key role of expelling spin angular momentum to the circumstellar nebula.
Our results place early-stage giant planet and stellar rotation within the same
evolutionary framework, and motivate further exploration of magnetohydrodynamic
phenomena in the context of the final stages of giant planet formation.

leads. The low-temperature transport properties of the model are controlled by
the ground-state occupation of the quantum dot, a circumstance that recent
density-functional approaches have explored. Here we show that the ground-state
dot occupation also parametrizes a linear mapping between the thermal
dependence of the zero-bias conductance and a universal function of the
temperature scaled by the Kondo temperature. Careful measurements by Grobis and
co-workers are very accurately fitted by the universal mapping. Nonetheless,
the dot occupation and an asymmetry parameter extracted from the same mapping
are relatively distant from the expected values. We conclude that mathematical
results derived from the model Hamiltonian reproduce accurately the universal
physical properties of the device. In contrast, non-universal features cannot
be reproduced quantitatively. To circumvent this limitation, \emph{ab initio}
studies of the device at high energies seem necessary, to accurately define the

question raised by Iz Singer a decade ago. Our answer is accessible to the
topologist, to the differential geometer and to the analyst who appreciates the
statement of the Index theorem of Atiyah,Patodi,Singer for manifolds with
boundary. The mini miracles are these: a] The Conner Floyd miracle that complex
bordism tensored over the Todd genus and the Bott miracle that stable complex

and of a generalized cohomology theory. b] That these theories, with the
covariant and contravariant geometric representations indicated, stably almost

are not only related by Alexander duality but they are also related by
Pontryagin duality. c] The abstract corollary of b] that stable complex bundles
have a complete system of numerical invariants and that these can be computed

Includes an additional appendix",,,,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Occasionally, developers need to ensure that the compiler treats their code
in a specific way that is only visible by inspecting intermediate or final
compilation artifacts. This is particularly common with carefully crafted
compositional libraries, where certain usage patterns are expected to trigger
an intricate sequence of compiler optimizations -- stream fusion is a
well-known example.
  The developer of such a library has to manually inspect build artifacts and
check for the expected properties. Because this is too tedious to do often, it
will likely go unnoticed if the property is broken by a change to the library
code, its dependencies or the compiler. The lack of automation has led to
released versions of such libraries breaking their documented promises.
  This indicates that there is an unrecognized need for a new testing paradigm,
inspection testing, where the programmer declaratively describes non-functional

We define inspection testing abstractly, implement it in the context of Haskell

learning by receiving additional reward signals. However, these signals can be
difficult to design manually, especially for complex RL tasks. We propose a
simple and general approach that determines the reward of pre-defined events by
their rarity alone. Here events become less rewarding as they are experienced
more often, which encourages the agent to continually explore new types of
events as it learns. The adaptiveness of this reward function results in a form
of automated curriculum learning that does not have to be specified by the
experimenter. We demonstrate that this \emph{Rarity of Events} (RoE) approach
enables the agent to succeed in challenging VizDoom scenarios without access to
the extrinsic reward from the environment. Furthermore, the results demonstrate
that RoE learns a more versatile policy that adapts well to critical changes in
the environment. Rewarding events based on their rarity could help in many
unsolved RL environments that are characterized by sparse extrinsic rewards but
a plethora of known event types.

text itself can be investigated under the lens of dynamical systems. A common

time series, and can thus be seen as a kind of dynamic natural language
processing (NLP). The extension has several benefits. Because it is part of a
suite of time series analysis tools, many measures can be extracted in one
common framework. Secondly, the measures have a close relationship with some
commonly used measures from natural language processing. Finally, using
recurrence analysis offers an opportunity expand analysis of text by developing

of concepts and procedures for understanding how a target model system (be it a

vision, this has largely been in the form of dataset evaluation for recognition
tasks where summary statistics are used to measure progress. While aggregate
performance has continued to improve, understanding individual causes of
failure has been difficult, as it is not always clear why a particular face
fails to be recognized, or why an impostor is recognized by an algorithm.
Importantly, other fields studying vision have addressed this via the use of
visual psychophysics: the controlled manipulation of stimuli and careful study
of the responses they evoke in a model system. In this paper, we suggest that
visual psychophysics is a viable methodology for making face recognition
algorithms more explainable. A comprehensive set of procedures is developed for
assessing face recognition algorithm behavior, which is then deployed over

parameters and dust reddening (M_star~M*(z~4)$, and E(B-V)=0.18+/-0.05)
estimated from the integrated light, are similar to those of smaller galaxies
at comparable redshifts. The ground-based morphology and spectroscopy show two
dominant components, both located off-center, embedded in more diffuse
emission. We speculate that G6025 may be a scaled-up version of chain galaxies
seen in deep HST imaging, or alternatively, a nearly equal-mass merger
involving two super-L* galaxies in its early stage. G6025 lies close to but not
within a known massive protocluster at z=3.78. We find four companions within 6
Mpc from G6025, two of which lie within 1.6 Mpc. While the limited sensitivity
of the existing spectroscopy does not allow us to robustly characterize the

the resulting method p-DMRG (perturbative DMRG) to distinguish it from the
standard variational DMRG. p-DMRG is expected to be useful for systems with
very large active spaces, for which variational DMRG becomes too expensive.
Similar to SCI+PT, in p-DMRG a zeroth-order wavefunction is first obtained by a
standard DMRG calculation, but with a small bond dimension. Then, the residual
correlation is recovered by a second-order perturbative treatment. We discuss
the choice of partitioning for the perturbation theory, which is crucial for
its accuracy and robustness. To circumvent the problem of a large bond
dimension in the first-order wavefunction, we use a sum of matrix product
states (MPS) to expand the first-order wavefunction, yielding substantial
savings in computational cost and memory. We also propose extrapolation schemes
to reduce the errors in the zeroth- and first-order wavefunctions. Numerical
results for Cr 2 with a (28e,76o) active space and 1,3-butadiene with a
(22e,82o) active space reveal that p-DMRG provides ground state energies of a
similar quality to variational DMRG with very large bond dimensions, but at a

only the ATLAS data, or both sets; (2) in the data reductions to each ensemble,
uncertainty regions are evaluated through error propagation from the fit

is modified in scalar modes with respect to the one of General Relativity,
albeit vector modes decay and do not show any significant effects. We thus
extend these results by involving multiple scalar field models. Further, we
study conformal transformations in teleparallel gravity and we obtain the

boundary terms. Finally, we propose the specific model $f(T,\phi,X)=T +

employ the observational Hubble data, constraining the coupling constant,

homophily or assortativity, where actors have a higher likelihood to be tied
with others having similar values of the variable under study. But there are
other mechanisms that may also play a role in how the attribute values of two
actors influence the likelihood of a tie. We discuss three additional
mechanisms: aspiration to send ties to others having high values; conformity in
the sense of sending more ties to others whose values are close to what may be
considered the `social norm'; and sociability, where those having higher values
will tend to send more ties generally. These mechanisms may operate jointly,
and then their effects will be confounded. We present a specification
representing these effects simultaneously by a four-parameter quadratic
function of the values of sender and receiver. Greater flexibility can be
obtained by a five-parameter extension. We argue that empirical researchers
often overlook the possibility that homophily may be confounded with these
other mechanisms, and that for actor attributes that have important effects on
directed networks, these specifications may provide an improvement. An
illustration is given of the dependence of advice ties on academic grades in a

both the orthorhombic and monoclinic configurations using a density functional
theory (DFT) approach with experimentally validated model inputs. The
proceeding discussion focuses on the Heyrovsky-type reactions for both the
associative and dissociative reaction pathway related to nitrogen reduction.
Key fundamental insight in the reduction mechanism is discussed that relates
the material properties of the substitutional ions to the nitrogen and hydrogen
affinities. Physical insight is gathered through interpretation of bound
electronic states at the surface. Compositional phases of higher Fe and Yb
concentrations resulted in decreased Mo-O binding and increased affinity
between Mo and the N and H species on the surface. The modulation of the Mo-O
binding is induced by strain as Yb and Fe are implemented, this, in turn,
shifts energy levels and modulates the band gap energy by approximately 0.2 eV.
This modification of Mo-O bond as substitution occurs is a result of the
orbital hybridization of M-O (M = Fe, Yb) that causes a strong orbital
interaction that shifts states. The optimal composition was predicted to be an
orthorhombic configuration of (Bi$_{0.75}$Fe$_{0.25}$)$_2$MoO$_6$ with a
predicted maximum thermodynamic energy barrier of 1.4 eV. This composition
demonstrates effective nitrogen and hydrogen affinity that follows the

and physical systems. A key challenge lies in the simultaneous optimization of
magnetic field sensitivity and maximum field range. In interferometry-based
magnetometry, a quantum two-level system acquires a dynamic phase in response
to an applied magnetic field. However, due to the 2{\pi} periodicity of the
phase, increasing the coherent interrogation time to improve sensitivity
results in reduced field range. Here we introduce a route towards both large
magnetic field range and high sensitivity via measurements of the geometric
phase acquired by a quantum two-level system. We experimentally demonstrate
geometric-phase magnetometry using the optically addressable electronic spin
associated with the nitrogen vacancy (NV) color center in diamond. Our approach
enables unwrapping of the 2{\pi} phase ambiguity, decoupling of magnetic field
range from sensitivity, and enhancement of the field range by about 400 times.
We also find additional improvement in sensitivity in the nonadiabatic regime,
and study how geometric-phase decoherence depends on adiabaticity. Our results
show that the geometric phase can be a versatile tool for quantum sensing
applications.

introduction of powerful machine learning tools such as Convolutional Neural

temporal information into CNNs are still being actively explored in the recent
literature. Motivated by the popular recurrent attention models in the research
area of natural language processing, we propose the Attention-based Temporal
Weighted CNN (ATW), which embeds a visual attention model into a temporal
weighted multi-stream CNN. This attention model is simply implemented as
temporal weighting yet it effectively boosts the recognition performance of
video representations. Besides, each stream in the proposed ATW framework is
capable of end-to-end training, with both network parameters and temporal
weights optimized by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with backpropagation.
Our experiments show that the proposed attention mechanism contributes
substantially to the performance gains with the more discriminative snippets by
focusing on more relevant video segments.

reachability-based approach characterizes the stochasticity of the future
obstacle states in a grid-free and recursion-free manner, using Fourier

switched systems with affine parameter-varying stochastic subsystems (DMSP) as
the obstacle dynamics, which includes Markov jump affine systems and
discrete-time affine parameter-varying stochastic systems (DPV). We define a
probabilistic occupancy function, to describe the probability that a given
state is occupied by a rigid body obstacle with stochastic dynamics at a given
time; keep-out sets are the super-level sets of this occupancy function. We
provide sufficient conditions that ensure convexity and compactness of these
keep-out sets for DPV obstacle dynamics. We also propose two computationally
efficient algorithms to overapproximate the keep-out sets --- a tight polytopic
approximation using projections, and an overapproximation using Minkowski sum.
For DMSP obstacle dynamics, we compute a union of convex and compact sets that
covers the potentially non-convex keep-out set. Numerical simulations show the
efficacy of the proposed algorithms for a modified version of the classical
unicycle dynamics, modeled as a DMSP.

Thanks to wavefront shaping, temporal and spatial refocusing have been
demonstrated. In this work, we study how these different methods can be
exploited to enhance a two-photon excitation fluorescence process. We first
compare the different techniques on micrometer-size isolated fluorescent beads.
We then demonstrate point-scanning imaging of such fluorescent microbeads

some nuclei with A$\leq$100, with $^{100}$Rb being the heaviest $\beta$2n
emitter measured to date. So far, only 25 P$_{2n}$ values have been determined
for the $\sim$300 nuclei that may decay in this way. Accordingly, it is of
interest to measure P$_{2n}$ values for the other possible multiple neutron
emitters throughout the chart of the nuclides. It is of particular interest to
make such measurement for nuclei with A$>$100 to test the predictions of
theoretical models and simulation tools for the decays of heavy nuclei in the
region of very neutron-rich nuclei. In addition, the decay properties of these
nuclei are fundamental for the understanding of astrophysical nucleosynthesis
processes such as the $r$-process, and safety inputs for nuclear reactors.
Purpose: To determine for the first time the two neutron branching ratio,
P$_{2n}$ value, for $^{136}$Sb through a direct neutron measurement, and to
provide precise P$_{1n}$ values for $^{136}$Sb and $^{136}$Te. Method: Pure
beams were provided by the JYFLTRAP at the IGISOL facility of the University of
Jyv\""askyl\""a, Finland. The purified ions were implanted into a moving tape at
the end of the beam line. The detection setup consisted of a plastic
scintillator placed right behind the implantation point, and the BELEN
detector, based on neutron counters embedded in a polyethylene matrix. The
analysis was based on the study of the $\beta$- and neutron- growth-and-decay
curves and the $\beta$-one-neutron and $\beta$-two-neutron time correlations.
Results: The P$_{2n}$ value of $^{136}$Sb was found to be 0.14(3)\% and the
measured P$_{1n}$ values for $^{136}$Sb and $^{136}$Te were found to be
32.2(15)\% and 1.47(6)\%, respectively. The measured P$_{2n}$ value is a factor
44 smaller than predicted by the FRDM+QRPA model used for $r$-process
calculations.

late phase in some solar flares that is characterized by a second peak in warm
coronal emissions ($\sim3$~MK) several tens of minutes to a few hours after the
soft X-ray (SXR) peak. Using the model enthalpy-based thermal evolution of
loops (EBTEL), in this paper we numerically probe the production of EUV
late-phase solar flares. Starting from two main mechanisms of producing the EUV
late phase, i.e., long-lasting cooling and secondary heating, we carry out two
groups of numerical experiments to study the effects of these two processes on
the emission characteristics in late-phase loops. In either of the two
processes an EUV late-phase solar flare that conforms to the observational
criteria can be numerically synthesized. However, the underlying hydrodynamic
and thermodynamic evolutions in late-phase loops are different between the two
synthetic flare cases. The late-phase peak due to a long-lasting cooling
process always occurs during the radiative cooling phase, while that powered by
a secondary heating is more likely to take place in the conductive cooling
phase. We then propose a new method for diagnosing the two mechanisms based on
the shape of EUV late-phase light curves. Moreover, from the partition of
energy input, we discuss why most solar flares are not EUV late flares.
Finally, by addressing some other factors that may potentially affect the loop
emissions, we also discuss why the EUV late phase is mainly observed in warm
coronal emissions.

security of many authentication and access control systems. By sensing and
comparing their surroundings, two or more devices can tell whether they are
copresent and use this information to make access control decisions. To the
best of our knowledge, all context-based copresence verification mechanisms to
date are susceptible to context-manipulation attacks. In such attacks, a
distributed adversary replicates the same context at the (different) locations
of the victim devices, and induces them to believe that they are copresent. In
this paper we propose DoubleEcho, a context-based copresence verification
technique that leverages acoustic Room Impulse Response (RIR) to mitigate
context-manipulation attacks. In DoubleEcho, one device emits a wide-band
audible chirp and all participating devices record reflections of the chirp
from the surrounding environment. Since RIR is, by its very nature, dependent
on the physical surroundings, it constitutes a unique location signature that
is hard for an adversary to replicate. We evaluate DoubleEcho by collecting RIR
data with various mobile devices and in a range of different locations. We show
that DoubleEcho mitigates context-manipulation attacks whereas all other
approaches to date are entirely vulnerable to such attacks. DoubleEcho detects
copresence (or lack thereof) in roughly 2 seconds and works on commodity

brightening is unexpected from the kilonova model or the off-axis top-hat jet
model for gamma-ray burst afterglows. In this paper, by assuming that the
merger remnant is a long-lived NS, we propose that the interaction between an
electron-positron-pair ($e^+e^-$) wind from the central NS and the jet could
produce a long-lived reverse shock, from which a new emission component would
rise and can interpret current observations well. The magnetic-field-induced
ellipticity of the NS is taken to be $4 \times 10^{-5}$ in our modeling, so
that the braking of the NS is mainly through the gravitational wave (GW)
radiation rather than the magnetic dipole radiation, and the emission
luminosity at early times would not exceed the observational limits. In our
scenario, since the peak time of the brightening is roughly equal to the
spin-down time scale of the NS, the accurate peak time may help constrain the
ellipticity of the remnant NS. We suggest that radio polarization observations
of the brightening would help to distinguish our scenario from other scenarios.
Future observations on a large sample of short gamma-ray burst afterglows or
detections of GW signals from merger remnants would test our scenario.

contaminants with two-step procedures, we examine how the detailed properties
in pCMDs depend on galaxy morphology and infrared color. The mean g - r color
as a function of surface brightness (mu_r) in the pCMD of a galaxy shows fine
performance in distinguishing between early- and late-type galaxies, but it is
not perfect because of the similarity between elliptical galaxies and
bulge-dominated spiral galaxies. On the other hand, the g - r color dispersion
as a function of mu_r works better. We find that the best set of parameters for
galaxy classification is the combination of the minimum color dispersion at
mu_r <= 21.2 mag/arcsec^2 and the maximum color dispersion at 20.0 <= mu_r <=
21.0 mag/arcsec^2: the latter reflects the complexity of stellar populations at
the disk component in a typical spiral galaxy. Finally, the color dispersion
measurements of an elliptical galaxy appear to be correlated with the WISE
infrared color ([4.6] - [12]). This indicates that the complexity of stellar
populations in an elliptical galaxy is related with its recent star formation
activities. From this observational evidence, we infer that gas-rich minor
mergers or gas interactions may have usually happened during the recent growth
of massive elliptical galaxies.

that can be geometrically studied as smooth statistical manifolds with respect
to any statistical divergence like the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence or the

divergence between distributions amounts to an equivalent Bregman divergence on
their corresponding parameters. In practice, the corresponding Bregman
generators of mixture/exponential families require to perform definite integral
calculus that can either be too time-consuming (for exponentially large

bias-free case the dynamics with bias becomes superdiffusive. In the
superdiffusive regime, we find a distinct initial ensemble dependence of the
diffusivity. We show that the time-averaged variance converges to the

However, trajectory-to-trajectory fluctuations of the time-averaged variance
decay slowly. Our finding suggests that in the superdiffusive regime the

engineering objectives. Growing interest in topics such as fairness and
algorithmic bias show that engineering-focused questions only comprise a subset
of the important questions about AI systems. This results in the AI Knowledge
Gap: the number of unique AI systems grows faster than the number of studies
that characterize these systems' behavior. To close this gap, we argue that the
study of AI could benefit from the greater inclusion of researchers who are
well positioned to formulate and test hypotheses about the behavior of AI
systems. We examine the barriers preventing social and behavioral scientists
from conducting such studies. Our diagnosis suggests that accelerating the
scientific study of AI systems requires new incentives for academia and
industry, mediated by new tools and institutions. To address these needs, we
propose a two-sided marketplace called TuringBox. On one side, AI contributors
upload existing and novel algorithms to be studied scientifically by others. On
the other side, AI examiners develop and post machine intelligence tasks
designed to evaluate and characterize algorithmic behavior. We discuss this
market's potential to democratize the scientific study of AI behavior, and thus
narrow the AI Knowledge Gap.

simulating two-phase flows throughout the years. However, there is a noticeable
dearth of literature focusing on objective comparisons between these methods,
especially when they are coupled to the momentum equation and applied in
physically relevant regimes. In this article, we compare two techniques for
simulating two-phase flows that possess attractive qualities, but belong to the
two distinct classes of diffuse interface (DI) and volume of fluid (VOF)
methods. Both of these methods allow for mass-conserving schemes that can
naturally capture large interfacial topology changes omnipresent in realistic
two phase flows. The DI solver used in this work is based on a conservative and
bounded phase field method, developed recently. Similar to level set methods,
this diffuse interface method takes advantage of the smoothness of the phase
field in computing curvature and surface tension forces. Geometric VOF methods
track the fractional tagged volume in a cell. The specific geometric VOF scheme
used here is a discretely conservative and bounded implementation that uses
geometric algorithms for unsplit advection and interface reconstruction, while
employing height functions for normal and curvature calculation. We present a
quantitative comparison of these methods on Cartesian meshes in terms of their
accuracy, convergence rate, and computational cost using canonical
two-dimensional (2D) two-phase test cases: a very dense drop moving through a
quiescent gas, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, an equilibrium static drop, an
oscillating drop and the damped surface wave. We further compare these methods
in their ability to resolve thin films by simulating the impact of a water drop
on a deep water pool. Using results of these studies, we suggest qualitative
guidelines for selection of schemes for two-phase flow calculations.

numerical results, including an analysis of the suboptimality of the optimal
state-dependent baseline. The result is a computationally efficient policy
gradient algorithm, which scales to high-dimensional control problems, as
demonstrated by a synthetic 2000-dimensional target matching task. Our
experimental results indicate that action-dependent baselines allow for faster
learning on standard reinforcement learning benchmarks and high-dimensional

strengths governed by the inhibitory spike-timing-dependent plasticity (iSTDP).
In previous works without considering iSTDP, BS was found to appear in a range
of noise intensities for fixed synaptic inhibition strengths. In contrast, in
our present work, we take into consideration iSTDP and investigate its effect
on BS by varying the noise intensity. Our new main result is to find occurrence
of a Matthew effect in inhibitory synaptic plasticity: good BS gets better via
LTD, while bad BS get worse via LTP. This kind of Matthew effect in inhibitory
synaptic plasticity is in contrast to that in excitatory synaptic plasticity
where good (bad) synchronization gets better (worse) via LTP (LTD). We note
that, due to inhibition, the roles of LTD and LTP in inhibitory synaptic
plasticity are reversed in comparison with those in excitatory synaptic
plasticity. Moreover, emergences of LTD and LTP of synaptic inhibition
strengths are intensively investigated via a microscopic method based on the
distributions of time delays between the pre- and the post-synaptic burst onset
times. Finally, in the presence of iSTDP we investigate the effects of network
architecture on BS by varying the symmetric attachment degree $l^*$ and the
asymmetry parameter $\Delta l$ in the SFN.

be constructed by decomposing its spectral representation. We investigate the
performance of this so-called \textit{intermedaite representation} (IR) from
several points of view. First, for two simple models, we study the number of
coefficients necessary to achieve a given tolerance in expanding the Green's

for fermions, and converges to a constant for bosons as temperature $T=1/\beta$
decreases. Second, we show that this remarkable feature is ascribed to the
properties of the physically constructed basis functions. The fermionic basis
functions have features in the spectrum whose width is scaled as $O(T)$, which
are consistent with the low-$T$ properties of quasiparticles in a Fermi liquid
state. On the other hand, the properties of the bosonic basis functions are
consistent with those of spin/orbital susceptibilities at low $T$. These
results demonstrate the potential wide application of the IR to calculations of

finding its topological characterization in terms of motifs and isolating the

partitioning a network by strength of connections and then analyzing the

Since many years, a new concept of detectors, the Micro Pattern Gas Detectors,
allows to overcome many of the problems of other types of commonly used
detectors, as drift chambers and microstrips, reducing the discharge rate and
increasing the radiation tolerance. Among these, one of the most commonly used
is the Gas Electron Multiplier. Commonly deployed as fast timing detectors and
triggers, due to their fast response, high rate capability and high radiation
hardness, they can also be used as trackers. The center of gravity readout
technique allows to overcome the limit of the digital pads, whose spatial
resolution is constrained by the pitch size. The presence of a high external
magnetic field can distort the electronic cloud and affect the spatial
resolution. The micro-TPC reconstruction method allows to reconstruct the three
dimensional particle position as in a traditional Time Projection Chamber, but
within a drift gap of a few millimeters. This method brings these detectors
into a new perspective for what concerns the spatial resolution in strong
magnetic field. In this report, the basis of this new technique will be shown
and it will be compared to the traditional center of gravity. The results of a
series of test beam performed with 10 x 10 cm2 planar prototypes in magnetic
field will also be presented. This is one of the first implementations of this
technique for GEM detectors in magnetic field and allows to reach unprecedented
performance for gas detectors, up to a limit of 120 micron at 1T, one of the
world's best results for MPGDs in strong magnetic field. The micro-TPC
reconstruction has been recently tested at very high rates in a test beam at

due to their comparable performance and fast speed. However, they lack
effective ways to adapt to changes in the target object's appearance, making
their tracking accuracy still far from state-of-the-art. In this paper, we
propose a dynamic memory network to adapt the template to the target's
appearance variations during tracking. An LSTM is used as a memory controller,
where the input is the search feature map and the outputs are the control
signals for the reading and writing process of the memory block. As the
location of the target is at first unknown in the search feature map, an
attention mechanism is applied to concentrate the LSTM input on the potential
target. To prevent aggressive model adaptivity, we apply gated residual
template learning to control the amount of retrieved memory that is used to
combine with the initial template. Unlike tracking-by-detection methods where
the object's information is maintained by the weight parameters of neural
networks, which requires expensive online fine-tuning to be adaptable, our
tracker runs completely feed-forward and adapts to the target's appearance
changes by updating the external memory. Moreover, unlike other tracking
methods where the model capacity is fixed after offline training --- the
capacity of our tracker can be easily enlarged as the memory requirements of a
task increase, which is favorable for memorizing long-term object information.
Extensive experiments on OTB and VOT demonstrates that our tracker MemTrack
performs favorably against state-of-the-art tracking methods while retaining
real-time speed of 50 fps.

from 10% for satellites of Milky Way (MW)-mass haloes to nearly 90% for

triggered by gas compression shortly after accretion. Both the LMC and M33 have
enhanced recent star formation that could be a manifestation of this process.
After infall into their MW-mass hosts, the $g-r$ colours of LMC-mass dwarfs

different from the previous works [12], [14] where an additional assumption of
stabilization of systems is made. The key points of this article can be summed
up as that an analytic solution to FBSDEs- MJ which makes the optimal
controller to be explicitly expressed and the method of trans- formation, i.e.,
the stabilization problem of indefinite case is boiled down to a definite one
whose stabilization is expressed by defining Lyapunov function via the optimal
cost subject to a new algebraic Riccati equation involving Markov jump

the SM rho could be detected with ""narrow width"" $\lesssim 100 \,{\rm GeV}$ at

In practice, however, their limited availability calls for solutions that also

that, in addition to a limited amount of available training data, exploit
artificial corpora that approximate elements of the ""gold"" training instances
with automatic translations. Following this idea, we present eSCAPE, the
largest freely-available Synthetic Corpus for Automatic Post-Editing released
so far. eSCAPE consists of millions of entries in which the MT element of the
training triplets has been obtained by translating the source side of
publicly-available parallel corpora, and using the target side as an artificial

models. For each MT paradigm, eSCAPE contains 7.2 million triplets for
English-German and 3.3 millions for English-Italian, resulting in a total of

strong dipole-dipole interactions in cold atoms. However, polaritons with the

their relevance to the change in viscous drag and turbulence statistics. The
present simulations confirmed an improved variation trend when the flow
dynamics is examined in the light of the groove size. At the lower end of the
range of groove size considered, the profiles of turbulence statistics more or
less resemble the plane channel flow, except for a systematic shift with the
groove size. When the groove size becomes increasingly large, the lodging of

between the OIII/X-ray luminosity depicting the accretion power, the radio
luminosity as a probe of the instantaneous jet power and the mass of the black
hole. For the first time, we use the 1.4 GHz FIRST radio luminosities on the
optical fundamental plane, to investigate whether or not FIRST fluxes can trace
nuclear activity. We use a SDSS-FIRST cross-correlated sample of 10149 active
galaxies and analyse their positioning on the optical fundamental plane. We
focus on various reasons that can cause the discrepancy between the observed
FIRST radio fluxes and the theoretically expected core radio fluxes, and show
that that FIRST fluxes are heavily contaminated by non-nuclear, extended
components and other environmental factors. We show that the subsample of
'compact sources', which should have negligible lobe contribution,
statistically follow the fundamental plane when corrected for relativistic
beaming, while all the other sources lie above the plane. The sample of LINERs,
which should have negligible lobe and beaming contribution, also follow the
fundamental plane. A combined fit of the low-luminosity AGN and the X-ray
binaries, with the LINERs, results in the relation log L$_R$ = 0.77 log
L$_{OIII}$ + 0.69 log M. Assuming that the original fundamental plane relation
is correct, we conclude that 1.4 GHz FIRST fluxes do not trace the pure 'core'

be inferred from existence of a Lyapunov function. Our approach is based on a
new concept of state for PDE systems which allows us to express the derivative
of the Lyapunov function as a Linear Operator Inequality directly on $L_2$ and
allows for any type of suitably well-posed boundary conditions. This approach
obviates the need for integration by parts, spacing functions or similar
mathematical encumbrances. The resulting algorithms are implemented in Matlab,
tested on several motivating examples, and the codes have been posted online.
Numerical testing indicates the approach has little or no conservatism for a

unsupervised incremental learning algorithm, TFusion, which is aided by the
transfer learning of the pedestrians' spatio-temporal patterns in the target

trained from small labeled source dataset to the unlabeled target dataset so as
to learn the pedestrians' spatial-temporal patterns. Secondly, a Bayesian
fusion model is proposed to combine the learned spatio-temporal patterns with
visual features to achieve a significantly improved classifier. Finally, we
propose a learning-to-rank based mutual promotion procedure to incrementally
optimize the classifiers based on the unlabeled data in the target domain.

order to meet present and future demands. Historically, time, frequency and
more recently, spatial dimensions have been used to improve capacity and
robustness. Paradoxically, radiocommunications that leverage the polarization
dimension have not evolved at the same pace. In particular, these
communications are widely used by satellites, where several streams are
multiplexed in each orthogonal polarization. Current communication trends
advocate for simplifying and unifying different frameworks in order to increase
flexibility and address future needs. Due to this, systems that do not require
channel information are progressively gaining traction. This dissertation aims
at challenging this perspective and promoting the use of polarization in new
radiocommunication systems. Consequently, the goal of this thesis is twofold:
first, we aim at increasing the current capacity of point-to-point and
point-to-multipoint links. Secondly, we introduce new mechanisms to increase
the robustness of communications in particularly hostile environments. In this
context, this thesis advocates for the use of polarization as a dimension to be
exploited in radiocommunications. In addition to the use of polarization, index
modulations help increase transmission rates whilst improving robustness
against errors and imperfections with a low computational complexity. Thus, the
study of polarization in these systems is essential. This dissertation explores
primordial aspects in this area, such as channel capacity, transmitter and
receiver design and performance benchmarking with current systems. Finally, we
identify and discuss various characteristic aspects of polarization. In this
thesis, the reader will navigate the mathematical foundations of the proposed
concepts as well as their implementation in real-life scenarios.

the frequency-dependent time delays of radio emissions from astrophysical

the similarity between the frequency-dependent dispersions due to the plasma

assuming the dispersion induced by the plasma effect is an unknown constant, we
obtain a robust limit on the photon mass by directly fitting a combination of
the dispersion measures of radio sources. Using the observed dispersion
measures from two statistical samples of extragalactic pulsars, here we show
that at the 68\% confidence level, the constraints on the photon mass can be as

efficient. Additionally, it retains image resolution from input to output,
captures fine-grained details, and can be trained end-to-end smoothly. To the

of the pulse profiles and spectra at the low gamma-ray flux state and at the
post-relaxation state. The phase-averaged spectra for both states can be well
described by a power-law component plus a blackbody component. The former is
dominated by unpulsed emission and is probably originated from the pulsar wind
nebula as reported by Hui et al (2015). The emission property of the blackbody
component is consistent with the emission from the polar cap heated by the
back-flow bombardment of the high-energy electrons or positrons that were
accelerated in the magnetosphere. We found no significant change in the X-ray
emission properties between two states. We suggest that the change of the X-ray
luminosity is at an order of ~4%, which is difficult to measure with the
current observations. We model the observed X-ray light curve with the heated
polar cap emission and we speculate that the observed large pulsed fraction is
owing to asymmetric magnetospheric structure.

superconductor (FeSC). We observe significant symmetry breaking in its
electronic structure and magnetic vortex which differentiates the ({\pi},
{\pi}) and ({\pi}, -{\pi}) directions of the unfolded Brillouin zone (BZ). It
is thus a novel nematic state, distinct from the nematicity of
undoped/lightly-doped FeSCs which breaks the ({\pi}, 0) / (0, {\pi})

can be well fitted with a nodal gap function. The gap is found to be suppressed
on surface Rb vacancies and at step edges, and the suppression is particularly
strong at the [110]-oriented edges. This is possibly due to a dx2-y2 like
pairing component with nodes along the [110] directions. We further

(ET) obtains a set of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) feedback values
from all ERs, and these values are used to estimate the channels between the ET
and all ERs. Next, based on the channel estimates, the ERs are grouped into
clusters, and the cluster that has its members closest to its centroid in phase
is selected for dedicated WET. The beamformer that maximizes the minimum
harvested energy among all ERs in the selected cluster is found by solving a
convex optimization problem. All ERs have the same chance of being selected
regardless of their distances from the ET, and hence, this scheduling policy
can be considered to be opportunistic as well as fair. It is shown that the

differential cross section for Compton scattering on the deuteron below the
pion-production threshold have decreased the uncertainties in the neutron
polarizabilities, yet the proton polarizabilities remain known substantially
more accurately. As the sensitivity of the cross section to the
polarizabilities increases with incident photon energy, measurements above the
pion threshold may offer a way for an improved determination of the neutron
polarizabilities. In this article, the first measurement of the cross section
for Compton scattering on the deuteron above the pion-production threshold is
presented.

official SO data dump. SOTorrent provides access to the version history of SO
content at the level of whole posts and individual text or code blocks. It
connects SO posts to other platforms by aggregating URLs from text blocks and
by collecting references from GitHub files to SO posts. In this paper, we
describe how we built SOTorrent, and in particular how we evaluated 134
different string similarity metrics regarding their applicability for
reconstructing the version history of text and code blocks. Based on a first
analysis using the dataset, we present insights into the evolution of SO posts,
e.g., that post edits are usually small, happen soon after the initial creation
of the post, and that code is rarely changed without also updating the
surrounding text. Further, our analysis revealed a close relationship between
post edits and comments. Our vision is that researchers will use SOTorrent to
investigate and understand the evolution of SO posts and their relation to
other platforms such as GitHub.

  Mathematical Biology",,,,"q-bio.SC nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Microtubules are filamentous tubular protein polymers which are essential for
a range of cellular behaviour, and are generally straight over micron length
scales. However, in some gliding assays, where microtubules move over a carpet
of molecular motors, individual microtubules can also form tight arcs or rings,
even in the absence of crosslinking proteins. Understanding this phenomenon may
provide important explanations for similar highly curved microtubules which can
be found in nerve cells undergoing neurodegeneration. We propose a model for
gliding assays where the kinesins moving the microtubules over the surface
induce ring formation through differential binding, substantiated by recent
findings that a mutant version of the motor protein kinesin applied in solution
is able to lock-in microtubule curvature. For certain parameter regimes, our
model predicts that both straight and curved microtubules can exist
simultaneously as stable steady-states, as has been seen experimentally.
Additionally, unsteady solutions are found, where a wave of differential
binding propagates down the microtubule as it glides across the surface, which
can lead to chaotic motion. Whilst this model explains two-dimensional
microtubule behaviour in an experimental gliding assay, it has the potential to
be adapted to explain pathological curling in nerve cells.

the transmitter and receiver, the PMod technique achieves an improvement in

polarized systems and does not require additional channel state information at
the transmitter; thus it can be used in current deployments. Demodulation (i.e.

diagram technique. Infinite sequences of diagrams containing ladder inserts,
which describe the interaction of electrons with these fluctuations, are
summed, and obtained equations are self-consistently solved for the ranges of
Hubbard repulsions $2t\leq U\leq 10t$, temperatures $0.2t\lesssim T\lesssim t$
and electron concentrations $0.7\lesssim\bar{n}\leq1$ with $t$ the intersite
hopping constant. For all considered $U$ the system exhibits a transition to
the long-range antiferromagnetic order at $T_{\rm AF}\approx 0.2t$. At the same
time no indication of charge ordering is observed. Obtained solutions agree
satisfactorily with results of other approaches and obey moments sum rules. In
the considered region of the $U$-$T$ plane, the curve separating metallic
solutions passes from $U\approx6t$ at the highest temperatures to $U=2t$ at
$T\approx T_{\rm AF}$ for half-filling. If only short-range fluctuations are
allowed for the remaining part of this region is occupied by insulating
solutions. Taking into account long-range fluctuations leads to strengthening
of maxima tails, which transform a part of insulating solutions into bad-metal
states. For low $T$, obtained results allow us to trace the gradual transition
from the regime of strong correlations with the pronounced four-band structure
and well-defined Mott gap for $U\gtrsim6t$ to the Slater regime of weak
correlations with the spectral intensity having a dip along the boundary of the
magnetic Brillouin zone due to an antiferromagnetic ordering for $U\lesssim3t$.
For $T\approx T_{\rm AF}$ and $U\gtrsim 7t$ doping leads to the occurrence of a
pseudogap near the Fermi level, which is a consequence of the splitting out of
a narrow band from a Hubbard subband.

driver in the design of communication systems. The use of MIMO techniques in

throughput. The basic underlying concept of MIMO is to exploit the signal and
channel characteristics to eliminate interference between multiple
transmissions. Departing from the work carried out under the industrial
projects \cite{NGW,Henarejos}, we extend the results provided in their
respective reports. The goal is to increase the SE without an increment of
radiated energy without any Channel State Information at Transmitter (CSIT) and
feedback at the transmitter and maintaining a very low computational complexity
at the receiver. Although a priori additional power is required to increase the
SE, we demonstrate that the proposed Polarized Modulation (PMod) scheme
exploits the polarization diversity reducing the required EbN0 and adding an
extra bit. We also introduce two receivers to demodulate this scheme of
different computational complexities. We describe a Near Optimal Detector (NOD)
which achieves almost the same performance as the optimal detector based on the
Maximum Likelihood Detection (MLD), but with lower computational complexity.
Finally, the results demonstrate that the PMod requires less EbN0 compared with
the single polarization case, guarantees the robustness in the presence of the
cross-polarization and validates that PMod can multiplex two streams of
different Quality of Service (QoS).

  We follow dynamics of gold expansion into the water along very long (up to
200 ns) time interval. This is significant because namely at these late times
pressure at a contact boundary between gold (Au) and water decreases down to
the saturation pressure of gold.
  Thus the saturation pressure begins to influence dynamics near the contact.
  The inertia of displaced water decelerates the contact.
  In the reference frame connected with the contact, the deceleration is
equivalent to the free fall acceleration in a gravity field.
  Such conditions are favorable for the development of Rayleigh-Taylor
instability (RTI) because heavy fluid (gold) is placed above the light one
(water) in a gravity field.
  We extract the increment of RTI from 2T-HD 1D runs.
  Surface tension and especially viscosity significantly dump the RTI gain
during deceleration. Atomistic simulation with Molecular Dynamics method
combined with Monte-Carlo method (MD-MC) for large electron heat conduction in
gold is performed to gain a clear insight into the underlying mechanisms. MD-MC
runs show that significant amplification of surface perturbations takes place.
  These perturbations start just from thermal fluctuations and the noise
produced by bombardment of the atmosphere by fragments of foam.
  The perturbations achieve amplification enough to separate the droplets from
the RTI jets of gold. Thus the gold droplets fall into the water.

function to determine the list of advertisements to show and the charging price

can simultaneously satisfy the platform, the users and the advertisers.
Moreover, advertisements showing positions under different queries from
different users may associate with advertisement candidates of different bid
price distributions and click probability distributions, which requires the
ranking functions to be optimized adaptively to the traffic characteristics. In
this work, we proposed a generic framework to optimize the ranking functions by

a simulated advertising environment, allowing adequate exploration of the
ranking function parameter space without hurting the performance of the

photos is a long studied topic in computer vision. Yet none of the existing
reconstruction pipelines fully addresses a progressive scenario where images
are only getting available during the reconstruction process and intermediate
results are delivered to the user. Incremental pipelines are capable of growing
a 3D model but often get stuck in local minima due to wrong (binding) decisions
taken based on incomplete information. Global pipelines on the other hand need
the access to the complete viewgraph and are not capable of delivering
intermediate results. In this paper we propose a new reconstruction pipeline
working in a progressive manner rather than in a batch processing scheme. The
pipeline is able to recover from failed reconstructions in early stages, avoids
to take binding decisions, delivers a progressive output and yet maintains the
capabilities of existing pipelines. We demonstrate and evaluate our method on
diverse challenging public and dedicated datasets including those with highly

where we fixate when viewing natural scenes. However, the importance of each of
these factors and how they interact remains a matter of debate. Here, we
disentangle these factors by analysing their influence over time. For this
purpose we develop a saliency model which is based on the internal
representation of a recent early spatial vision model to measure the low-level
bottom-up factor. To measure the influence of high-level bottom-up features, we
use a recent DNN-based saliency model. To account for top-down influences, we
evaluate the models on two large datasets with different tasks: first, a
memorisation task and, second, a search task. Our results lend support to a
separation of visual scene exploration into three phases: The first saccade, an
initial guided exploration characterised by a gradual broadening of the
fixation density, and an steady state which is reached after roughly 10
fixations. Saccade target selection during the initial exploration and in the
steady state are related to similar areas of interest, which are better
predicted when including high-level features. In the search dataset, fixation
locations are determined predominantly by top-down processes. In contrast, the
first fixation follows a different fixation density and contains a strong
central fixation bias. Nonetheless, first fixations are guided strongly by
image properties and as early as 200 ms after image onset, fixations are better
predicted by high-level information. We conclude that any low-level bottom-up
factors are mainly limited to the generation of the first saccade. All saccades
are better explained when high-level features are considered, and later this
high-level bottom-up control can be overruled by top-down influences.

difficult for more complex networks. For this reason, identification in dynamic

ESO public spectroscopic survey ""VANDELS, a deep VIMOS survey of the CANDELS
CDFS and UDS fields"". VANDELS' main targets are star-forming galaxies at
2.4<z<5.5 and massive passive galaxies at 1<z<2.5. By adopting a strategy of
ultra-long exposure times, from 20 to 80 hours per source, VANDELS is designed
to be the deepest ever spectroscopic survey of the high-redshift Universe.
Exploiting the red sensitivity of the VIMOS spectrograph, the survey has
obtained ultra-deep spectra covering the wavelength 4800-10000 A with
sufficient signal-to-noise to investigate the astrophysics of high-redshift
galaxy evolution via detailed absorption line studies. The VANDELS-DR1 is the
release of all spectra obtained during the first season of observations and
includes data for galaxies for which the total (or half of the total) scheduled
integration time was completed. The release contains 879 individual objects
with a measured redshift and includes fully wavelength and flux-calibrated 1D
spectra, the associated error spectra, sky spectra and wavelength-calibrated 2D
spectra. We also provide a catalog with the essential galaxy parameters,
including spectroscopic redshifts and redshift quality flags. In this paper we
present the survey layout and observations, the data reduction and redshift
measurement procedure and the general properties of the VANDELS-DR1 sample. We
also discuss the spectroscopic redshift distribution, the accuracy of the
photometric redshifts and we provide some examples of data products. All
VANDELS-DR1 data are publicly available and can be retrieved from the ESO
archive. Two further data releases are foreseen in the next 2 years with a
final release scheduled for June 2020 which will include improved re-reduction
of the entire spectroscopic data set. (abridged)

convergence to the limit cycle and weak inputs). While previous studies mostly

challenge of phase-amplitude reduction is to compute amplitude coordinates
globally, in the basin of attraction of the limit cycle.
  In this paper, we propose a method to compute the full set of phase-amplitude

(composition) operator and aims at computing the eigenfunctions of the operator
through Laplace averages (in combination with the harmonic balance method).
This yields a forward integration method that is not limited to two-dimensional
systems. We illustrate the method by computing the so-called isostables of
limit cycles in two, three, and four-dimensional state spaces, as well as their
responses to strong external inputs.

widespread applications in many diverse fields of research study. The potential
applications includes ranging from quantum physics, harmonic analysis, optical
information processing, pattern recognition to varied allied areas of signal

investigated and applied to many signal processing applications, most important
among these are convolution, product and correlation theorems. Still many
magnificent research works related to the conventional FrFT lacks the elegance
and simplicity of the convolution, product and correlation theorems similar to
the Euclidean Fourier transform (FT), which for convolution theorem states that
the FT of the convolution of two functions is the product of their respective

Building on the seminal work of Pei et al. and the potential of the simplified

established to present an elegant definition of convolution, product and

spectrum is broadband and non-monotonous, thus posing a challenge to existing
noise spectroscopy schemes. Here, we compare several methods for noise
spectroscopy: spectral decomposition based on the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill
(CPMG) sequence, the recently presented DYnamic Sensitivity COntrol (DYSCO)
sequence and a modified DYSCO sequence with a Gaussian envelope (gDYSCO). The
performance of the sequences is quantified by analytic and numeric
determination of the frequency resolution, bandwidth and sensitivity, revealing
a supremacy of gDYSCO to reconstruct non-trivial features. Utilizing an
ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond coupled to a high density
$^{13}$C nuclear spin environment, we experimentally confirm our findings. The
combination of the presented schemes offers potential to record high quality
noise spectra as a prerequisite to generate quantum systems unlimited by their
spin-bath environment.

also the standard supergravity equations. We argue that for this to happen $K$

then analyze the consequences for non-abelian T-duality and the closely related

a string sigma model on a non-unimodular (sub)algebra one generates a
non-vanishing $K$ proportional to the trace of the structure constants. This is

decays into the radiation bath of the hot big bang. The model is generic and

accompanied with the accumulation of Mn2+ induced by electronic reconstruction.

obtained ultra-deep optical (0.48 < lambda < 1.0 micron) spectroscopy of ~2100
galaxies within the redshift interval 1.0 < z < 7.0, over a total area of ~0.2
sq. degrees centred on the CANDELS UDS and CDFS fields. Based on accurate
photometric redshift pre-selection, 85% of the galaxies targeted by VANDELS
were selected to be at z>=3. Exploiting the red sensitivity of the refurbished
VIMOS spectrograph, the fundamental aim of the survey is to provide the high
signal-to-noise ratio spectra necessary to measure key physical properties such
as stellar population ages, masses, metallicities and outflow velocities from
detailed absorption-line studies. Using integration times calculated to produce
an approximately constant signal-to-noise ratio (20 < t_int < 80 hours), the
VANDELS survey targeted: a) bright star-forming galaxies at 2.4 < z < 5.5, b)
massive quiescent galaxies at 1.0 < z < 2.5, c) fainter star-forming galaxies
at 3.0 < z < 7.0 and d) X-ray/Spitzer-selected active galactic nuclei and
Herschel-detected galaxies. By targeting two extragalactic survey fields with
superb multi-wavelength imaging data, VANDELS will produce a unique legacy data

localization of Co impurities, exhibit singlet-to-triplet excitation at low
temperature without any ordered spin correlation. The localized gapped
excitation evolves into a gapless quasi-continuum as dimer pairs break and
create freely fluctuating fractionalized spins at high temperature. Together,

The present contribution describes the latest developments in obtaining

perpendicular magnetic anisotropy up to 4 nm thick Co films, and of the
existence of chiral left-handed N\'eel-type domain walls stabilized by the
effective Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in the stack. The experiments
show evidence of a sizeable DMI at the gr/Co interface, which is described in
terms of a conduction electron mediated Rashba-DMI mechanism and points
opposite to the Spin Orbit Coupling-induced DMI at the Co/Pt interface. In
addition, the presence of graphene results in: i) a surfactant action for the

two central dynamical processes in cells and organisms: (i) active motility and
motility control and (ii) self-organized pattern formation. The unifying theme
is the nonlinear dynamics of biological function and its robustness in the
presence of strong fluctuations, structural variations, and external
perturbations. We theoretically investigate motility control at the cellular
scale, using cilia and flagella as ideal model system. Cilia and flagella are
highly conserved slender cell appendages that exhibit spontaneous bending
waves. This flagellar beat represents a prime example of a chemo-mechanical
oscillator, which is driven by the collective dynamics of molecular motors
inside the flagellar axoneme. We study the nonlinear dynamics of flagellar
swimming, steering, and synchronization, which encompasses shape control of the
flagellar beat by chemical signals and mechanical forces. Mechanical forces can
synchronize collections of flagella to beat at a common frequency, despite
active motor noise that tends to randomize flagellar synchrony. In Chapter 2,
we present a new physical mechanism for flagellar synchronization by mechanical
self-stabilization that applies to free-swimming flagellated cells. This new
mechanism is independent of direct hydrodynamic interactions between flagella.
Comparison with experimental data provided by experimental collaboration
partners in the laboratory of J. Howard (Yale, New Haven) confirmed our new
mechanism in the model organism of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas.
Further, we characterize the beating flagellum as a noisy oscillator. Using a
minimal model of collective motor dynamics, we argue that measured
non-equilibrium fluctuations of the flagellar beat result from stochastic motor
dynamics at the molecular scale. Noise and mechanical coupling are antagonists

orbiting a nearby M dwarf, starting with a previously suggested stable
configuration. The long-term stability of this configuration is confirmed, but
the motion of planets is found to be chaotic. The eccentricity values are found
to vary within finite ranges. The rates of tidal dissipation and tidal
evolution of orbits are estimated, assuming an Earth-like rheology for the
planets. We find that under this assumption the planets b, d, e were captured
in the 3:2 or higher spin-orbit resonances during the initial spin-down but
slipped further down into the 1:1 resonance. Dependent on its rheology, the
innermost planet b may be captured in a stable pseudosynchronous rotation.
Non-synchronous rotation ensures higher levels of tidal dissipation and
internal heating. The positive feedback between the viscosity and the
dissipation rate -- and the ensuing runaway heating -- are terminated by a few
self-regulation processes. When the temperature is high and the viscosity is
low enough, the planet spontaneously leaves the 3:2 resonance. Further heating
is stopped either by passing the peak dissipation or by the emergence of
partial melt in the mantle. In the post-solidus state, the tidal dissipation is
limited to the levels supported by the heat transfer efficiency. The tides on
the host star are unlikely to have had a significant dynamical impact. The
tides on the synchronized inner planets tend to reduce these planets' orbital
eccentricity, possibly contributing thereby to the system's stability.

the Alon-Tarsi number as defined by Jensen and Toft (1995) in their seminal
book on graph coloring problems. The Alon-Tarsi number of $G$, $AT(G)$, is the
smallest $k$ for which there is an orientation, $D$, of $G$ with max indegree
$k\!-\!1$ such that the number of even and odd circulations contained in $D$
are different. It is known that $\chi(G) \leq \chi_\ell(G) \leq \chi_p(G) \leq
AT(G)$, where $\chi(G)$ is the chromatic number, $\chi_\ell(G)$ is the list
chromatic number, and $\chi_p(G)$ is the paint number of $G$. In this paper we
find families of graphs $G$ and $H$ such that $\chi(G \square H) = AT(G \square
H)$, reducing this sequence of inequalities to equality. We show that the
Alon-Tarsi number of the Cartesian product of an odd cycle and a path is always
equal to 3. This result is then extended to show that if $G$ is an odd cycle or
a complete graph and $H$ is a graph on at least two vertices containing the
Hamilton path $w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$ such that for each $i$, $w_i$ has a most
$k$ neighbors among $w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_{i-1}$, then $AT(G \square H) \leq

extensions for $G \square H$, where $G$ is such that $V(G)$ can be partitioned
into odd cycles and complete graphs, and $H$ is a graph containing a
Hamiltonian path. We apply these bounds to get chromatic-choosable Cartesian

spheres with bonding strength. The proposed mechanistic contact laws are
continuous at the onset of unloading by means of a regularization term, in the
spirit of a cohesive zone model, that introduces a small and controllable error
in the conditions for interparticle breakage. This continuity property is in
sharp contrast with the behavior of standard mechanistic loading and unloading
contact theories, which exhibit a discontinuity at the onset of unloading when
particles form solid bridges during plastic deformation. The formulation
depends on five material properties, namely two elastic properties (Young's
modulus and Poisson's ratio), two plastic properties (a plastic stiffness and a
power-law hardening exponent) and one fracture mechanics property (fracture
toughness), and its predictions are in agreement with detailed finite-element
simulations. The numerical robustness and efficiency of the proposed
formulation are borne out by performing three-dimensional particle mechanics
static calculations of microstructure evolution during the three most important
steps of powder die-compaction, namely during compaction, unloading, and
ejection. These simulations reveal the evolution, up to relative densities
close to one, of microstructural features, process variables and compact
mechanical attributes which are quantitatively similar to those experimentally
observed and in remarkable agreement with the (semi-)empirical formulae
reported in the literature.

(VELO) is essential to reducing background in searches for long-lived exotic
particles, and in identifying jets that originate from beauty and charm quarks.
Secondary interactions of hadrons produced in beam-gas collisions are used to
map the location of material in the VELO. Using this material map, along with
properties of a reconstructed secondary vertex and its constituent tracks, a
$p$-value can be assigned to the hypothesis that the secondary vertex
originates from a material interaction. A validation of this procedure is
presented using photon conversions to dimuons.

that many of the known constructions of ETFs are of one of two types. We
further provide a new method for combining a given ETF of one of these two
types with an appropriate group divisible design (GDD) in order to produce a
larger ETF of the same type. By applying this method to known families of ETFs
and GDDs, we obtain several new infinite families of ETFs. The real instances
of these ETFs correspond to several new infinite families of strongly regular

user-defined inlier-outlier threshold in RANSAC. Instead of estimating the
noise sigma, it is marginalized over a range of noise scales. The optimized
model is obtained by weighted least-squares fitting where the weights come from
the marginalization over sigma of the point likelihoods of being inliers. A new
quality function is proposed not requiring sigma and, thus, a set of inliers to
determine the model quality. Also, a new termination criterion for RANSAC is
built on the proposed marginalization approach. Applying sigma-consensus,
MAGSAC is proposed with no need for a user-defined sigma and improving the
accuracy of robust estimation significantly. It is superior to the
state-of-the-art in terms of geometric accuracy on publicly available
real-world datasets for epipolar geometry (F and E) and homography estimation.
In addition, applying sigma-consensus only once as a post-processing step to
the RANSAC output always improved the model quality on a wide range of vision
problems without noticeable deterioration in processing time, adding a few
milliseconds. The source code is at https://github.com/danini/magsac.

also related to the power of differential equations. When deterministically
extended structures are taken into consideration, it is admissible that
fractals are dense both in the nature and in the dynamics. In particular, this
is true because fractal structures are closely related to chaos. This implies
that dynamics have to be an instrument of the extension. Oppositely, one can
animate the arguments for the Demon if dynamics will be investigated with
fractals. To make advances in the direction, first of all, one should consider
fractals as states of dynamics. In other words, instead of single points and
finite/infinite dimensional vectors, fractals should be points of trajectories
as well as trajectories themselves. If one realizes this approach, fractals
will be proved to be dense in the universe, since modeling the real world is
based on differential equations and their developments. Our main goal is to

under-saturated fluid. This diffusive process is driven by the difference
between the gas concentration near the bubble, whose value is governed by the
internal pressure through Henry's law, and the concentration in the far field.
The presence of neighbouring bubbles can significantly slow down this process
by increasing the effective background concentration and reducing the diffusing
flux of dissolved gas experienced by each bubble. We develop theoretical
modelling of such diffusive shielding process in the case of small microbubbles
whose internal pressure is dominated by Laplace pressure. We first use an exact
semi-analytical solution to capture the case of two bubbles, analyse in detail
the shielding effect and show that hydrodynamic effects are mostly negligible
except in the case of almost-touching bubbles. In order to tackle the case of
multiple bubbles, we then derive and validate two analytical approximate yet
generic frameworks, first using the method of reflections and then by proposing
a self-consistent continuum description. Using both modelling frameworks, we
examine the dissolution of regular 1D, 2D and 3D bubble lattices. Bubbles
located at the edge of the lattices dissolve first, while innermost bubbles
benefit from the diffusive shielding effect, leading to the inward propagation
of a dissolution front within the lattice. We show that diffusive shielding
leads to severalfold increases in the dissolution time which grows
logarithmically with the number of bubbles in 1D-lattices and algebraically in
two and three dimensions, scaling respectively as its square root and
2/3-power. We further illustrate the sensitivity of the dissolution patterns to
initial fluctuations in bubble size or arrangement in the case of large and
dense lattices, as well as non-intuitive oscillatory effects.

in video content. Different from existing works, which all learn to segment
from a fixed vocabulary of actor and action pairs, we infer the segmentation
from a natural language input sentence. This allows to distinguish between
fine-grained actors in the same super-category, identify actor and action
instances, and segment pairs that are outside of the actor and action
vocabulary. We propose a fully-convolutional model for pixel-level actor and
action segmentation using an encoder-decoder architecture optimized for video.
To show the potential of actor and action video segmentation from a sentence,
we extend two popular actor and action datasets with more than 7,500 natural
language descriptions. Experiments demonstrate the quality of the
sentence-guided segmentations, the generalization ability of our model, and its
advantage for traditional actor and action segmentation compared to the
state-of-the-art.

recently been investigated extensively. In this paper, we propose a novel video
rain streak removal approach FastDeRain, which fully considers the
discriminative characteristics of rain streaks and the clean video in the
gradient domain. Specifically, on the one hand, rain streaks are sparse and
smooth along the direction of the raindrops, whereas on the other hand, clean
videos exhibit piecewise smoothness along the rain-perpendicular direction and
continuity along the temporal direction. Theses smoothness and continuity
results in the sparse distribution in the different directional gradient
domain, respectively. Thus, we minimize 1) the $\ell_1$ norm to enhance the
sparsity of the underlying rain streaks, 2) two $\ell_1$ norm of unidirectional
Total Variation (TV) regularizers to guarantee the anisotropic spatial
smoothness, and 3) an $\ell_1$ norm of the time-directional difference operator
to characterize the temporal continuity. A split augmented Lagrangian shrinkage
algorithm (SALSA) based algorithm is designed to solve the proposed
minimization model. Experiments conducted on synthetic and real data
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. According
to comprehensive quantitative performance measures, our approach outperforms
other state-of-the-art methods especially on account of the running time. The

possible to shape it to the desired form: a Cylindrical Gas Electron Multiplier

Rohacell, a PMI foam, will give solidity to cathode and anode with a very low
impact on material budget. The entire detector is sustained by Permaglass rings
glued at the edges. These rings are used to assembly the CGEM, together with a
dedicated Vertical Insertion System and moreover they host the On-Detector
electronic. The anode has been improved w.r.t. the state of the art through a
jagged readout that minimize the inter-strip capacitance. The mechanical
challenge of this detector requires a precision of the entire geometry within
few hundreds of microns in the whole area. In this contribution an overview of
the construction technique, the validation of this technique through the
realization of a CGEM, and its first tests will be presented. These activities

developed as a collaboration of many national and international projects, has
become a major factor in the discovery and dissemination of astronomical
information worldwide. The IVOA has been coordinating all these efforts
worldwide to ensure a common VO framework that enables transparent access to
and interoperability of astronomy resources (data and software) around the
world. The VO is not a magic solution to all astronomy data management
challenges but it does bring useful solutions in many areas borne out by the
fact that VO interfaces are broadly found in astronomy major data centres and
projects worldwide. Astronomy data centres have been building VO services on
top of their existing data services to increase interoperability with other
VO-compliant data resources to take advantage of the continuous and increasing
development of VO applications. VO applications have made multi-instrument and
multi-wavelength science, a difficult and fruitful part of astronomy, somewhat
easier. More recently, several major new astronomy projects have been directly
adopting VO standards to build their data management infrastructure, giving
birth to VO built-in archives. Embracing the VO framework from the beginning
brings the double gain of not needing to reinvent the wheel and ensuring from
the start interoperability with other astronomy VO resources. Some of the IVOA
standards are also starting to be used by neighbour disciplines like planetary
sciences. There is still quite a lot to be done on the VO, in particular
tackling the upcoming big data challenge and how to find interoperable
solutions to the new data analysis paradigm of bringing and running the
software close to the data.

observe the $Z'$ in the $\mu^+ \mu^-$ and $\mu^+\mu^- b$ modes based on an
effective model with major phenomenological constraints imposed. We find that
both modes can be discovered with 3000 fb$^{-1}$ data if the $Z'bs$ coupling
saturates the latest $B_s-\bar B_s$ mixing limit from UTfit at around
$2\sigma$. Besides, a tiny right-handed $Z'bs$ coupling, if it exists, opens up
the possibility of a relatively large left-handed counterpart, due to
cancellation in the $B_s-\bar B_s$ mixing amplitude. In this case, we show that
even a data sample of $\mathcal{O}(100)$ fb$^{-1}$ would enable discovery of
both modes. We further study the impact of a $Z'bb$ coupling as large as the
$Z'bs$ coupling. This scenario enables discovery of the $Z'$ in both modes with
milder effects on the $B_s-\bar B_s$ mixing, but obscures the relevance of the
$Z'$ to $b \to s\ell\ell$. Discrimination between the $Z'bs$ and $Z'bb$
couplings may come from the production cross section for the $Z'b\bar{b}$ final
state. However, we do not find the prospect for this to be promising.

to current approaches based on algebraic quantum field theory. One key
ingredient is the adoption of a local notion of entropic time in which instants
are defined on curved three-dimensional surfaces and time evolution consists of
the accumulation of changes induced by local deformations of these surfaces.
The resulting dynamics is a non-dissipative diffusion that is constrained by
the requirements of foliation invariance and incorporates the necessary local
quantum potentials. As applications of the formalism we derive the Ehrenfest

  to Bundled Pricing",,,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Today, many wireless device providers choose to sell devices bundled with
complementary mobile social services, which exhibit strong positive network
externality. This paper aims to quantify the benefits of selling devices and
complementary services under the following three strategies: separate pricing,
bundled pricing, and hybrid pricing (both the separate and bundled options are
offered). A comprehensive comparison of the above three strategies is carried
out for two popular service models, namely physical connectivity sharing and
virtual content sharing, respectively. We first study the physical service
model where the provider (e.g., FON) offers users customized WiFi devices for
indoor Internet access, and allows service subscribers to physically access all
device owners' WiFi when traveling. Observing that all device-owners contribute
to the connectivity sharing, we show, via a Stackelberg game theoretic
approach, that bundled pricing outperforms separate pricing as long as the
total cost of device and service is reasonably low to stimulate network
externality. Further, hybrid pricing strictly dominates bundled pricing thanks
to the pricing flexibility to keep high marginal profit of device-selling.
Next, we investigate the virtual sharing service model where the provider
(e.g., Apple) sells devices and device-supported applications. Different from
the connectivity service model, in this model service subscribers directly
contribute to the virtual content sharing, and the network externality can be
fairly strong. We prove that hybrid pricing degenerates to bundled pricing if
the network externality degree is larger than the average device valuation,
which is in stark contrast with the connectivity service model in which hybrid
pricing always outperforms bundled pricing.

two theories are not isomorphic at least in dimensions two and three. We
establish a natural map from the cubical to the path homology groups which is
an isomorphism in dimension one and surjective in dimension two. Again our

survey. KELT-22Ab transits the moderately bright ($V\sim 11.1$) Sun-like G2V
star TYC 7518-468-1. The planet has an orbital period of $P = 1.3866529 \pm
0.0000027 $ days, a radius of $R_{P} = 1.285_{-0.071}^{+0.12}~R_{J}$, and a
relatively large mass of $M_{P} = 3.47_{-0.14}^{+0.15}~ M_{J}$. The star has
$R_{\star} = 1.099_{-0.046}^{+0.079}~ R_{\odot}$, $M_{\star} =
1.092_{-0.041}^{+0.045}~ M_{\odot}$, ${T_{\rm eff}\,} = 5767_{-49}^{+50}~$ K,
${\log{g_\star}} = 4.393_{-0.060}^{+0.039}~$ (cgs), and [m/H] =
$+0.259_{-0.083}^{+0.085}~$, and thus, other than its slightly super-solar
metallicity, appears to be a near solar twin. Surprisingly, KELT-22A exhibits
kinematics and a Galactic orbit that are somewhat atypical for thin disk stars.
Nevertheless, the star is rotating quite rapidly for its estimated age, shows
evidence of chromospheric activity, and is somewhat metal rich. Imaging reveals
a slightly fainter companion to KELT-22A that is likely bound, with a projected
separation of 6\arcsec ($\sim$1400 AU). In addition to the orbital motion
caused by the transiting planet, we detect a possible linear trend in the
radial velocity of KELT-22A suggesting the presence of another relatively
nearby body that is perhaps non-stellar. KELT-22Ab is highly irradiated (as a
consequence of the small semi-major axis of $a/R_{\star} = 4.97$), and is
mildly inflated. At such small separations, tidal forces become significant.
The configuration of this system is optimal for measuring the rate of tidal
dissipation within the host star. Our models predict that, due to tidal forces,
the semi-major axis of KELT-22Ab is decreasing rapidly, and is thus predicted
to spiral into the star within the next Gyr.

energy (vibration, shocks) into electrical energy, in order to supply
energy-autonomous sensor nodes in industrial, biomedical or domotic
applications. Non-linear extraction strategies such as Synchronous Electrical
Charge Extraction (SECE) [1-2], energy investing [3] or Synchronized Switch
Harvesting on Inductor (SSHI) [4] have been developed to maximize the extracted
energy from harmonic excitations. However, in most of today's applications,
vibrations are not periodic and mechanical shocks occur at unpredictable rates
[4]. SSHI interfaces naturally seemed to be the most appropriate candidate for
harvesting shocks as they exhibit outstanding performance in periodic
excitations [4]. However, the SSHI strategy presents inherent weaknesses while
harvesting shocks, since the invested energy stored in the piezoelectric
capacitance cannot be recovered. In this work, we propose a self-starting,
battery-less, 0.55mm 2 integrated energy harvesting interface based on SECE
strategy which has been optimized to work under shock stimulus. Due to the
sporadic nature of mechanical shocks which imply long periods of inactivity and
brief energy peaks, the interface's average consumption is optimized by
minimizing the quiescent power. A dedicated energy saving sequencing has thus
been designed, reducing the static current to 30nA and enabling energy to be
extracted with only one single 8$\mu$J shock occurring every 100s. Our
SECE-based circuit features a shock FoM 1.6x greater than previous SSHI-based
interfaces [4]. The proposed system depicted in Fig.1 is made of a negative
voltage converter rectifying the PEH output voltage, and a SECE power path
controlled by a sequenced circuit. The sequencing is divided in 4 phases and
the associated time diagrams are illustrated in Fig.2. During the sleeping mode
T1, all blocks except the shock detection (SD) are turned off. During the
starting phase, the energy is stored in CASIC through a cold-start path,
increasing VASIC. This will progressively turn on the SD. Next, when stress
applied to the piezoelectric material leads to an increase in VREC, the SD

enabled scientists to gain considerable headway in framing global environmental

have begun to show significant promise, driven by the advent of technology and
its increased proliferation in coupled human and natural systems. Such settings
lie on the interface of engineering, social and environmental sciences, and as
such, require a common language in order for natural resources to be studied,
managed and ultimately sustained. In this dissertation, we argue that the
systems theoretic tradition of cybernetics may provide the necessary common
ground for examining such systems.
  After discussing the relevance of the cybernetic approach to natural resource
governance, we present a mathematical model of resource consumption, grounded
in social psychological research on consumer behavior. We also provide
interpretations of the model at various levels of abstraction in the social
network of the consuming population. We demonstrate the potential of the model
by examining it in various theoretic frameworks which include dynamical
systems, optimal control theory, game theory and the theory of learning in
games. Each framework yields different policy guidelines to avoid Tragedy of

aims to test and develop the new Action Principle. We study a model of rotating
planets, a compressible fluid in a stationary state of motion, under the
influence of a fixed or mutual gravitational field. The main problem is to
account for the shape and the velocity fields, given the size of the equatorial
bulges, the angular velocity at equator and the density profiles. The theory is
applied to the principal objects in the solar system, from Earth and Mars to
Saturn with fine details of its hexagonal flow and to Haumea with its odd

angular velocity field near the surface. Planetary rings are an unforeseen, but
a natural and inevitable feature of the dynamics; no cataclysmic event need be
invoked to justify them. The simple solutions that have been studied so far are
most suitable for the hard planets, and for them the predicted density profiles
are reasonable. The effect of precession was not taken into account, nor were
entropic forces, so far. There has not yet been a systematic search for truly

is in contradiction with observation. The analysis is repeated in many
textbooks and reviews up to 2017, and its failure to agree with observation was
duly noted. More successful approaches have been found, but little was done to
discover the weak point of Rayleigh's argument, what is the reason that it
fails. This paper identifies the mistake as one that is endemic in the
literature. Since the physics of the problem remains poorly understood, a
discussion of this paradox should prove useful. Briefly, the argument depends
on the Navier-Stokes equation and on the assumption that a certain expression
called ""energy density"" or ""kinetic potential"" can be interpreted and used as
such. It is shown here that %no energy density is compatible with the
Navier-Stokes equation, in the context of Couette flow or in general, and that
the use of any expression as a kinetic potential is in conflict with the
Navier-Stokes equation, in all but a very limited context.
  An alternative analysis of basic Couette flow, based on an action principle
for compressible fluids, provides a Hamiltonian density as well as a kinetic
potential. The two are not the same, even in the simplest cases. The action
principle provides a kinetic potential; a new criterion for stability
recognizes the profound effect of the surface adhesion and the tensile strength
of water. It is in full agreement with observation.
  Several new experiments are suggested.

also proven under a classical CFL condition. For the same level of refinement,
the relaxation scheme is shown to be much more accurate than Rusanov's scheme,

perform much better in terms of computational cost than Rusanov's scheme.
Moreover, contrary to Rusanov's scheme which develops strong oscillations when
approximating vanishing phase solutions, the numerical results show that the

Existing attempts based on local interpretations aim to identify relevant

bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose to investigate a guided feature

management mechanism for the smart grid that enables each prosumer of the
network to participate in energy trading with one another and the grid. This
poses a significant challenge in terms of modeling the decision-making process
of each participant with conflicting interest and motivating prosumers to
participate in energy trading and to cooperate, if necessary, for achieving
different energy management goals. Therefore, such decision-making process
needs to be built on solid mathematical and signal processing tools that can
ensure an efficient operation of the smart grid. This paper provides an
overview of the use of game theoretic approaches for P2P energy trading as a
feasible and effective means of energy management. As such, we discuss various
games and auction theoretic approaches by following a systematic classification
to provide information on the importance of game theory for smart energy
research. Then, the paper focuses on the P2P energy trading describing its key
features and giving an introduction to an existing P2P testbed. Further, the
paper zooms into the detail of some specific game and auction theoretic models
that have recently been used in P2P energy trading and discusses some important
finding of these schemes.

the charge dynamics (radiation reaction) cannot be ignored. Here we show that
classical radiation-reaction effects alter qualitatively and quantitatively the
infrared behavior of the spectrum of the radiation emitted by an electron in
the presence of an intense electromagnetic plane wave (nonlinear Thomson
scattering). An analytical expression of the infrared limit of nonlinear
Thomson scattering is provided, which includes radiation-reaction effects and
is valid for an arbitrary plane wave. Apart from their own conceptual
importance and as a signature of classical radiation reaction, these results
provide the limiting expression of the corresponding and yet unknown exact
infrared behavior of strong-field QED in an intense plane wave.

projective geometry. Especially, we will analyze the properties of a projective
space over a non-Archimedean field. Non-Archimedean fields contain numbers that
are smaller than every real number: the so called ""infinitesimal"" numbers. The
theory is well known from non-standard analysis. This enables us to define
projective objects that deviate only infinitesimally (in an appropriate metric)
from each other. And we show that in most cases operations involving such
objects that deviate infinitesimally also experience only infinitesimal change.
Another focus will be where this property does not hold true and show that this
usually involves discontinuity or degeneration.
  Furthermore, we will explore common projective concepts like projective
transformations, cross-ratios and conics in a non-standard setting.

numerical performance was analyzed in simulated market environments. This
allows consideration of market dynamics that are not analytically tractable or
can not be empirically analyzed due to practical complications. Our findings
implicate that the relative performance of algorithms varies substantially
across different market dynamics, which confirms the intrinsic complexity of
pricing and learning in the presence of competition.

concurrent vision) image labeling algorithm which is a (semi-) hierarchical
algorithm commencing with a partition made up of single pixel regions and
merging regions or subsets of regions using a Markov random field (MRF) image
model. It is an example of a general approach to computer vision called
concurrent vision in which the operations of image segmentation and image
classification are carried out concurrently. While many image labeling
algorithms output a single partition, or segmentation, the MCV algorithm
outputs a sequence of partitions and this more elaborate structure may provide
information that is valuable for higher level vision systems. With certain
types of MRF the component of the system for image evaluation can be
implemented as a hardwired feed forward neural network. While being applicable
to images (i.e. 2D signals), the algorithm is equally applicable to 1D signals
(e.g. speech) or 3D signals (e.g. video sequences) (though its performance in
such domains remains to be tested). The algorithm is assessed using subjective
and objective criteria with very good results.

Young, Math.
Biosci. 72, 51 (1984)] enables reconstructing basic features of patterns of
skin. Our extended model allows studying the formatting of patterns and their
temporal evolution also on the favourable and hostile environments. As a
result, the impact of different types of an environment is accounted for the
dynamics of patterns formation. The process is based on two diffusible
morphogens, the short-range activator and the long-range inhibitor, produced by
differentiated cells (DCs) represented as black pixels. For a neutral
environment, the extended model reduces to the original one. However, even the
reduced model is statistically sensitive to a type of the initial distribution
of DCs. To compare the impact of the uniform random distribution of DCs
(R-system) and the non-uniform distribution in the form of random
Gaussian-clusters (G-system), we chose inhibitor as the control parameter. To
our surprise, in the neutral environment, for the chosen inhibitor-value that
ensures stable final patterns, the average size of final G-populations is lower
than in the R-case. In turn, when we consider the favourable environment, the
relatively bigger shift toward higher final concentrations of DCs appears in
the G. Thus, in the suitably favourable environment, this order can be
reversed. Furthermore, the different critical values of the control parameter
for the R and the G suggest some dissimilarities in temporal evolution of both
systems. In particular, within the proper ranges of the critical values, their
oscillatory behaviours are different. The respective temporal evolutions are
illustrated by a few examples.
