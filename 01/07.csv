DeGroot model of learning in networks, but arise as an equilibrium outcome

is nearly optimal as neighborhoods grow large. A key condition for this is
signal diversity: each individual's neighbors have private signals that not
only contain independent information, but also have sufficiently different
distributions. Without signal diversity $\unicode{x2013}$ e.g., if private
signals are i.i.d. $\unicode{x2013}$ learning is suboptimal in all networks and
highly inefficient in some. Turning to social influence, we find it is much
more sensitive to one's signal quality than to one's number of neighbors, in

hydrodynamics, and radiative transfer, we study the explosion of stars with an
extended and tenuous envelope (i.e., stars in which 95% of the mass is
contained within 10% of the surface radius or less). We consider both H-rich
supergiant and He-giant progenitors resulting from close-binary evolution and
dying with a final mass of 2.8-5Msun. An extended envelope causes the supernova
(SN) shock to brake and a reverse shock to form, sweeping core material into a
dense shell. The shock deposited energy, which suffers little degradation from
expansion, is trapped in ejecta layers of moderate optical depth, thereby
enhancing the SN luminosity at early times. With the delayed 56Ni heating, we
find that the resulting optical and near-IR light curves all exhibit a
double-peak morphology. We show how an extended progenitor can explain the blue
and featureless optical spectra of some Type IIb and Ib SNe. The dense shell
formed by the reverse shock leads to line profiles with a smaller and
near-constant width. This ejecta property can explain the statistically
narrower profiles of Type IIb compared to Type Ib SNe, as well as the peculiar
Halpha profile seen in SN1993J. At early times, our He-giant star explosion
model shows a high luminosity, a blue color, and featureless spectra
reminiscent of the Type Ib SN2008D, suggesting a low-mass progenitor.

  surface impedance","8 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cond-mat.dis-nn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Scattering of TM-polarized surface plasmon-polariton waves (PPW) by a finite
segment of the metal-vacuum interface with randomly fluctuating surface
impedance is examined. Solution of the integral equation relating the scattered
field with the field of the incident PPW, valid for arbitrary scattering
intensity and arbitrary dissipative characteristics of the conductive medium,
is analyzed. As a measure of the PPW scattering, the Hilbert norm of the
integral scattering operator is used. The strength of the scattering is shown
to be determined not only by the parameters of the fluctuating impedance
(dispersion, correlation radius and the length of the inhomogeneity region) but
also by the conductivity of the metal. If the scattering operator norm is
small, the PPW is mainly scattered into the vacuum, thus losing its energy
through the excitation of quasi-isotropic bulk Norton-type waves above the
conducting surface. The intensity of the scattered field is expressed in terms
of the random impedance pair correlation function, whose dependence on the
incident and scattered wavenumbers shows that in the case of
random-impedance-induced scattering of PPW it is possible to observe the effect
analogous to Wood's anomalies of wave scattering on periodic gratings. Under
strong scattering, when the scattering operator norm becomes large compared to
unity, the radiation into free space is strongly suppressed, and, in the limit,
the incoming PPW is almost perfectly back-reflected from the inhomogeneous part
of the interface. This suggests that within the model of a dissipation-free
conducting medium, the surface polariton is unstable against arbitrary small
fluctuations of the medium polarizability. Transition from quasi-isotropic weak
scattering to nealy back-reflection under strong fluctuations of the impedance
is interpreted in terms of Anderson localization.

general interaction rules as combinations of Boolean covariates, that explain a

as an incompletely specified Boolean function synthesis problem. This
incompleteness of the problem will also generate spurious inferences, which are
a serious threat to valid inductive inference rules. Using random Boolean data
as a null model, here we attempt to measure the competition between valid and

greedy search algorithms, which synthesize a given Boolean response variable in

between the two is close to the axion mass. Under the spin induced
axion-electron interaction an electron is excited from the first to the second

further via radiation of a suitably chosen photon energy to the appropriately

presence of the axion. The system is in a magnetic field so that the energies

first partitions the user equipments (UEs) with different mobility patterns

Then, within each cluster, an asynchronous multi-user deep reinforcement
learning scheme is developed to control the HO processes across the UEs in each
cluster, in the goal of lowering the HO rate while ensuring certain system
throughput. In this scheme, we use a deep neural network (DNN) as an HO
controller learned by each UE via reinforcement learning in a collaborative
fashion. Moreover, we use supervised learning in initializing the DNN
controller before the execution of reinforcement learning to exploit what we
already know with traditional HO schemes and to mitigate the negative effects
of random exploration at the initial stage. Furthermore, we show that the
adopted global-parameter-based asynchronous framework enables us to train
faster with more UEs, which could nicely address the scalability issue to
support large systems. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed framework can achieve better performance than the state-of-art on-line
schemes, in terms of HO rates.

dealing with the high-dimensional ($\sim$$10^2$) spatially dependent LiDAR

We
treat the coupling between helical states at opposite surfaces of the film in
the properly-adapted tunneling approximation, and show that the tunneling
matrix element oscillates as function of both the film thickness and the
momentum in the plane of the film for Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Bi$_2$Te$_3$. As a
result, while the magnitude of the matrix element at the center of the surface
Brillouin Zone gives the gap in the energy spectrum, the sign of the matrix
element uniquely determines the topological properties of the film, as
demonstrated by explicitly computing the pseudospin textures and the Chern
number. We find a sequence of transitions between topological and
non-topological phases, separated by semimetallic states, as the film thickness
varies. In the topological phase the edge states of the film always exist but
only carry a spin current if the edge potentials break particle-hole symmetry.
The edge states decay very slowly away from the boundary in Bi$_2$Se$_3$,
making Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$, where this scale is shorter, a more promising
candidate for the observation of these states. Our results hold for
free-standing films as well as heterostructures with large-gap insulators.

theoretical classification scheme that distinguishes four complexity levels of
morphogenetic collective systems based on the nature of their components and

self-propelled particle swarm model to investigate the effects of (1)
heterogeneity of components, (2) differentiation/re-differentiation of
components, and (3) local information sharing among components, on the
self-organization of a collective system. Results showed that (a) heterogeneity
of components had a strong impact on the system's structure and behavior, (b)
dynamic differentiation/re-differentiation of components and local information
sharing helped the system maintain spatially adjacent, coherent organization,
(c) dynamic differentiation/re-differentiation contributed to the development
of more diverse structures and behaviors, and (d) stochastic re-differentiation
of components naturally realized a self-repair capability of self-organizing
morphologies. We also explored evolutionary methods to design novel
self-organizing patterns, using interactive evolutionary computation and
spontaneous evolution within an artificial ecosystem. These self-organizing
patterns were found to be remarkably robust against dimensional changes from 2D
to 3D, although evolution worked efficiently only in 2D settings.

between linear non-normality and nonlinearity in which non-normal growth of a
subset of perturbations configured to transfer energy from the externally
forced component of the turbulent state to the perturbation component maintains
the perturbation energy, while the subset of energy-transferring perturbations
is replenished by nonlinearity. Although it is accepted that both linear
non-normality mediated energy transfer from the forced component of the mean
flow and nonlinear interactions among perturbations are required to maintain
the turbulent state, the detailed physical mechanism by which these processes
interact in maintaining turbulence has not been determined. In this work a
statistical state dynamics based analysis is performed on turbulent Couette
flow at $R=600$ and a comparison to DNS is used to demonstrate that the
perturbation component in Couette flow turbulence is replenished by a
non-normality mediated parametric growth process in which the fluctuating
streamwise mean flow has been adjusted to marginal Lyapunov stability. It is
further shown that the alternative mechanism in which the subspace of
non-normally growing perturbations is maintained directly by
perturbation-perturbation nonlinearity does not contribute to maintaining the
turbulent state. This work identifies parametric interaction between the
fluctuating streamwise mean flow and the streamwise varying perturbations to be
the mechanism of the nonlinear interaction maintaining the perturbation
component of the turbulent state, and identifies the associated Lyapunov
vectors with positive energetics as the structures of the perturbation subspace
supporting the turbulence.

  Frontiers in Mathematics. Birkh\""auser/Springer, Cham, 2021",,,"math.AP math.DG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper is about the influence of Geometry on the qualitative behaviour of
solutions of quasilinear PDEs on Riemannian manifolds. Motivated by examples
arising, among others, from the theory of submanifolds, in particular by the
study of entire graphs with prescribed mean curvature, we consider classes of
coercive differential inequalities of the form $$ \mathrm{div}\left(
\frac{\varphi(|\nabla u|)}{|\nabla u|} \nabla u\right) \ge b(x)f(u) l(|\nabla
u|) \qquad \text{(respectively, $\le$ or $=$)} $$ on domains of a manifold $M$,
for suitable $\varphi,b,f,l$, with emphasis on mean curvature type operators.
We investigate the validity of strong maximum principles, compact support
principles and Liouville type theorems; in particular, the goal is to identify
sharp thresholds, involving curvatures or volume growth of geodesic balls in
$M$, to guarantee the above properties under appropriate Keller-Osserman type
conditions, and to discuss the geometric reasons behind the existence of such
thresholds. The paper also aims to give a unified view of recent results in the
literature. The bridge with Geometry is realized by studying the validity of
weak and strong maximum principles at infinity, in the spirit of Omori-Yau's
Hessian and Laplacian principles and subsequent improvements.

continuum attenuated by an interstellar extinction. We evaluated the systematic
uncertainty upon the spectral parameters by various calibration items. In the
2-12 keV band, the SXS result is consistent with the literature values in flux

0.11). The discrepancy is attributable to the systematic uncertainty of about
$+$6/$-$7% and $+$2/$-$5% respectively for the flux and the power-law index.
The softer spectrum is affected primarily by the systematic uncertainty of the
Dewar gate valve transmission and the event screening.

mode estimate with a Laplacian prior. Obtaining samples from the full posterior
distribution, the Bayesian Lasso, confers major advantages in performance as
compared to having only the Lasso point estimate. Traditionally, the Bayesian
Lasso is implemented via Gibbs sampling methods which suffer from lack of
scalability, unknown convergence rates, and generation of samples that are
necessarily correlated. We provide a measure transport approach to generate
i.i.d samples from the posterior by constructing a transport map that
transforms a sample from the Laplacian prior into a sample from the posterior.
We show how the construction of this transport map can be parallelized into
modules that iteratively solve Lasso problems and perform closed-form linear
algebra updates. With this posterior sampling method, we perform maximum
likelihood estimation of the Lasso regularization parameter via the EM
algorithm. We provide comparisons to traditional Gibbs samplers using the
diabetes dataset of Efron et al. Lastly, we give an example implementation on a
computing system that leverages parallelization, a graphics processing unit,
whose execution time has much less dependence on dimension as compared to a
standard implementation.

multiphase model with a dynamic mesh model to track the gradually accumulated
silica along the pipe walls of a heat exchanger. Surface roughness was modelled
by prescribing sinusoidally-shaped protrusions on the wall boundary. The silica
bed height grew quickest at the peaks of the ripples and the spacing between

pairwise measurements and provides a formalization for many problems arising in

case in which a subset of the measurements fed to pose graph optimization is
spurious. Our first contribution is to develop robust estimators that can cope
with heavy-tailed measurement noise, hence increasing robustness to the
presence of outliers. Since the resulting estimators require solving nonconvex
optimization problems, we further develop convex relaxations that approximately
solve those problems via semidefinite programming. We then provide conditions
under which the proposed relaxations are exact. Contrarily to existing
approaches, our convex relaxations do not rely on the availability of an
initial guess for the unknown poses, hence they are more suitable for setups in
which such guess is not available (e.g., multi-robot localization, recovery
after localization failure). We tested the proposed techniques in extensive
simulations, and we show that some of the proposed relaxations are indeed tight
(i.e., they solve the original nonconvex problem 10 exactly) and ensure
accurate estimation in the face of a large number of outliers.

efficiency is of far-reaching significance to the development of
nanotherapeutics, yet challenging due to large length-scale discrepancies
between NP and red blood cell (RBC) as well as the complexity of NP dynamics.
Recently, a lattice-Boltzmann (LB) based multiscale simulation method has been
developed to capture both NP scale and cellular level transport phenomenon at
high computational efficiency. The basic components of this method include the
LB treatment for the fluid phase, a spectrin-link method for RBCs, and a
Langevin dynamics (LD) approach to capturing the motion of the suspended NPs.
Comprehensive two-way coupling schemes are established to capture accurate
interactions between each component. The accuracy and robustness of the LB-LD
coupling method are demonstrated through the relaxation of a single NP with
initial momentum and self-diffusion of NPs. This approach is then applied to
study the migration of NPs in a capillary vessel under physiological
conditions. It is shown that Brownian motion is most significant for the NP
distribution in capillary vessels. For 1~100 nm particles, the Brownian
diffusion is the dominant radial diffusive mechanism compared to the
RBC-enhanced diffusion. For ~500 nm particles, the Brownian diffusion and
RBC-enhanced diffusion are comparable drivers for the particle radial diffusion
process.

applications, protocols, and measurement-based analyses. We describe a new
approach for identifying OWDs via passive measurement of Network Time Protocol
(NTP) traffic. NTP traffic offers the opportunity to measure OWDs accurately
and continuously from hosts throughout the Internet. Based on detailed examina-
tion of NTP implementations and in-situ behavior, we develop an analysis tool
that we call TimeWeaver, which enables assessment of precision and accuracy of
OWD measurements from NTP. We apply TimeWeaver to a ~1TB corpus of NTP traffic
collected from 19 servers located in the US and report on the characteristics
of hosts and their associated OWDs, which we classify in a precision/accuracy
hierarchy. To demonstrate the utility of these measurements, we apply iterative
hard-threshold singular value decomposition to estimate OWDs between arbitrary
hosts from the high- est tier in the hierarchy. We show that this approach
results in highly accurate estimates of OWDs, with average error rates on the
order of less than 2%. Finally, we outline a number of applications---in
particular, IP geolocation, network operations and management---for hosts in
lower tiers of the precision hierarchy that can benefit from TimeWeaver,
offering directions for future work.

offer guidelines for charging service providers to determine proper charging

profitability, enhancing customer satisfaction, and reducing impact on power
grid in spite of these uncertainties. We propose a new metric to assess the
impact on power grid without solving complete power flow equations. To protect
service providers from severe financial losses, a safeguard of profit is
incorporated in the model. Two algorithms --- stochastic dynamic programming
(SDP) algorithm and greedy algorithm (benchmark algorithm) --- are applied to
derive the pricing and electricity procurement policy. A Pareto front of the
multiobjective optimization is derived. Simulation results show that using SDP
algorithm can achieve up to 7% profit gain over using greedy algorithm.
Additionally, we observe that the charging service provider is able to reshape

Perhaps surprisingly, we found that this continuum-space literature has been
mostly unaware of MFD theory, and no attempts exist to verify the assumptions
of MFD theory. This has the potential to create significant inconsistencies,
and research is needed to analyze their extent and ways to resolve them. We

still assumes fixed route between the source and destination that every packet

Although some studies considered scattering of the flows dynamically in the

Furthermore, this research discovers that the conditions used in previous

Further, this scalable model can predict traffic speed for both freeway and

on both pelvis and swing foot tracking errors, naturally takes the swing
dynamics into account. Suggested adjustments are added to the Cartesian 3LP
gaits and converted to joint-space trajectories through inverse kinematics.
Fixed and adaptive foot lift strategies also ensure enough ground clearance in
perturbed walking conditions. The proposed structure is robust, yet uses very
simple state estimation and basic position tracking. We rely on the physical

time-projection in extreme push recovery scenarios. We also show self-produced

existence of mesoscopic two-dimensional (2D) coherent charge transport in
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) film by
performing structural investigations and high-field magnetoconductance (MC)
measurements in magnetic fields of up to 15 T. We succeeded in observing marked
positive MCs reflecting 2D electronic states in a conventional drop-cast film.
This low-dimensional feature is surprising, since PEDOT:PSS-a mixture of two
different polymers-seems to be significantly different from crystalline 2D
materials in the viewpoint of the structural inhomogeneity, especially in
popular drop-cast thick films. The results of the structural experiments
suggest that such 2D transport originates from the nanometer-scale
self-assembled laminated structure, which is composed of PEDOT nanocrystals
wrapped by insulating sheets consisting of amorphous PSSs. These results

critical to support emerging diversified applications, e.g., Tactile Internet

developed to reduce the channel signaling overhead, thereby supporting
low-latency communication. Specifically, we develop a low-rank approach to
recover the original information only based on a single observed vector without
any channel estimation. Unfortunately, this problem turns out to be a highly
intractable non-convex optimization problem due to the multiple non-convex
rankone constraints. To address the unique challenges, the quotient manifold
geometry of product of complex asymmetric rankone matrices is exploited by
equivalently reformulating original complex asymmetric matrices to the
Hermitian positive semidefinite matrices. We further generalize the geometric
concepts of the complex product manifolds via element-wise extension of the
geometric concepts of the individual manifolds. A scalable Riemannian
trust-region algorithm is then developed to solve the blind demixing problem
efficiently with fast convergence rates and low iteration cost. Numerical
results will demonstrate the algorithmic advantages and admirable performance
of the proposed algorithm compared with the state-of-art methods.

radially-varying temperature profiles. The efficiency of thermal conduction in
the intracluster medium (ICM) is complicated by the existence of turbulence and
magnetic fields, and has received a lot of attention in the literature.
Previous studies suggest that the magnetothermal instability developed in outer
regions of galaxy clusters would drive magnetic field lines preferentially
radial, resulting in efficient conduction along the radial direction. Using a
series of spherically-symmetric simulations, here we investigate the impact of
thermal conduction on the observed temperature distributions in outer regions
of three massive clusters, and find that thermal conduction substantially
modifies the ICM temperature profile. Within 3 Gyr, the gas temperature at a
representative radius of $0.3r_{500}$ typically decreases by ~10 - 20% and the
average temperature slope between $0.3r_{500}$ and $r_{500}$ drops by ~ 30 -
40%, indicating that the observed ICM would not stay in a long-term equilibrium
state in the presence of thermal conduction. However, X-ray observations show
that the outer regions of massive clusters have remarkably similar
radially-declining temperature profiles, suggesting that they should be quite
stable. Our study thus suggests that the effective conductivity along the
radial direction must be suppressed below the Spitzer value by a factor of 10
or more, unless additional heating sources offset conductive cooling and
maintain the observed temperature distributions. Our study provides a
smoking-gun evidence for the suppression of parallel conduction along magnetic
field lines in low-collisionality plasmas by kinetic mirror or whistler
instabilities.

outstanding photovoltaic devices with long non-radiative lifetimes as a crucial
feature enabling high efficiencies. Long non-radiative lifetimes occur if the
transfer of the energy of the electron-hole pair into vibrational energy is
slow, due to, e.g., a low density of defects, weak electron phonon coupling or
the release of a large number of phonons needed for a single transition. Here,
we discuss the implications of the known material properties of metal-halide
perovskites (such as permittivities, phonon energies and effective masses) and
combine those with basic models for electron-phonon coupling and
multiphonon-transition rates in polar semiconductors. We find that the low
phonon energies of MAPbI$_3$ lead to a strong dependence of recombination rates
on trap position, which can be readily deduced from the underlying physical
effects determining non-radiative transitions. Here, we show that this is
important for the non-radiative recombination dynamics of metal-halide
perovskites, as it implies that these systems are rather insensitive to defects
that are not at midgap energy. This can lead to long lifetimes, which indicates
that the low phonon energies are likely an important factor for the high
performance of optoelectronic devices with metal halide perovskites.

the Galactic plane and the planar eccentricity ($e_p$) of RC stars for both of
the potential models. The largest radial metallicity gradient in the $0<z_{max}

not depend on $e_p$ subsamples. There is a large radial metallicity gradient
for thin disc, but no radial gradient found for thick disc. Moreover, the
largest radial metallicity gradients are obtained where the outer Lindblad

single-objective and multi-objective optimization problems. The central insight
of this paper is to use the prior knowledge (gained from prior runs) to choose
the next promising configuration. This strategy reduces the effort (i.e.,
number of measurements) required to find the (near) optimal configuration. We
evaluate FLASH using 30 scenarios based on 7 software systems to demonstrate
that FLASH saves effort in 100% and 80% of cases in single-objective and
multi-objective problems respectively by up to several orders of magnitude
compared to the state of the art techniques.

star surface by means of the catastrophic eruption model, and find that the
variation of the geometry of multipolar fields on the magnetar surface could
result in the catastrophic rearrangement of the magnetosphere, which provides
certain physical mechanism for the outburst of giant flares. The magnetospheric
model we adopted consists of two assumptions: a helically twisted flux rope is
suspended in an ideal force-free magnetosphere around the magnetar, and a
current sheet emerges during the flux rope evolution. Magnetic energy
accumulates during the flux rope's gradual evolution along with the variation
of magnetar surface magnetic structure before the eruption. The two typical
behaviors, either state transition or catastrophic escape, would take place
once the flux rope loses equilibrium, thus tremendous accumulated energy is
radiated. We have investigated the equilibrium state of the flux rope and the
energy release affected by different multipolar structures, and find structures
that could trigger violent eruption and provide the radiation approximately
0.5$\%$ of the total magnetic energy during the giant flare outburst. Our
results provide certain multipolar structures of the neutron star's magnetic
field with an energy release percentage 0.42$\%$ in the state transition and
0.51$\%$ in the catastrophic escape case, which are sufficient for the
previously reported energy release from SGR 1806-20 giant flares.

similar attractiveness. To study the distribution of preferences that emerge in
such situations, a useful approach is to simulate opinion dynamics on top of
complex networks, composed by nodes (individuals) and their connections
(edges), where the state of each node can be one amongst several opinions
including the undecided state. We use two different dynamics rules: the one
proposed by Travieso-Fontoura (TF) and the plurality rule (PR), which are
paradigmatic of outflow and inflow dynamics, respectively. We are specially
interested in the impact of the network randomness on the final distribution of
opinions. For that purpose, we consider Watts-Strogatz networks, which possess
the small-world property, and where randomness is controlled by a probability
$p$ of adding random shortcuts to an initially regular network. Depending on
the value of $p$, the average connectivity $\langle k \rangle$, and the initial
conditions, the final distribution can be basically (i) consensus, (ii)
coexistence of different options, or (iii) predominance of indecision. We find
that, in both dynamics, the predominance of a winning opinion is favored by
increasing the number of reconnections (shortcuts), promoting consensus. In
contrast to the TF case, in the PR dynamics, a fraction of undecided nodes can
persist in the final state. In such cases, a maximum number of undecided nodes
occurs within the small-world region, due to ties in the decision group.

addition of the latest local $H_{0}$ measurement favors a larger spectral
index, and can exert a significant influence on the model selection of
inflation. In this work, we investigate its impacts on the status of brane
inflation models. We find that, when the direct $H_{0}$ measurement is
considered, the prototype model of brane inflation is still in good agreement
with the current observational data within the $2\sigma$ level range. For the
KKLMMT model, the consideration of the $H_{0}$ measurement allows the range of
the parameter $\beta$ to be amplified to ${\cal O}(10^{-2})$, which slightly
alleviates the fine-tuning problem. For the IR DBI model, the addition of the
$H_{0}$ measurement does not provide a better fit. These results show that the
consideration of the new $H_{0}$ prior can exert a considerable influence on
the brane inflation models. At last, we show that, when $\beta \lesssim 1.1$,
the equilateral non-Gaussianity in the IR DBI inflation model is compatible
with the current CMB data at the 1$\sigma$ level.

correctly matched spectroscopically, though resonances are neglected in the
RDW. To ensure completeness, a high energy range up to 500 Ry above the

with its specific distribution, for which the information entropy based methods
have been deeply developed in many scientific areas including physics. The
dynamical properties of heavy-ion collisions (HICs) process make it difficult
and complex to study the nuclear matter and its evolution, for which Shannon
information entropy theory can provide new methods and observables to
understand the physical phenomena both theoretically and experimentally. To
better understand the processes of HICs, the main characteristics of typical
models, including the quantum molecular dynamics models, thermodynamics models,
and statistical models, etc, are briefly introduced. The typical applications
of Shannon information theory in HICs are collected, which cover the chaotic
behavior in branching process of hadron collisions, the liquid-gas phase
transition in HICs, and the isobaric difference scaling phenomenon for
intermediate mass fragments produced in HICs of neutron-rich systems. Even
though the present applications in heavy-ion collision physics are still
relatively simple, it would shed light on key questions we are seeking for. It
is suggested to further develop the information entropy methods in nuclear

  Imaging, Autonomous Vehicles and Machines 2018",,,,"eess.IV astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Training autonomous vehicles requires lots of driving sequences in all
situations\cite{zhao2016}. Typically a simulation environment
(software-in-the-loop, SiL) accompanies real-world test drives to
systematically vary environmental parameters. A missing piece in the optical
model of those SiL simulations is the sharpness, given in linear system theory
by the point-spread function (PSF) of the optical system. We present a novel
numerical model for the PSF of an optical system that can efficiently model
both experimental measurements and lens design simulations of the PSF. The
numerical basis for this model is a non-linear regression of the PSF with an
artificial neural network (ANN). The novelty lies in the portability and the
parameterization of this model, which allows to apply this model in basically
any conceivable optical simulation scenario, e.g. inserting a measured lens
into a computer game to train autonomous vehicles. We present a lens
measurement series, yielding a numerical function for the PSF that depends only
on the parameters defocus, field and azimuth. By convolving existing images and
videos with this PSF model we apply the measured lens as a transfer function,
therefore generating an image as if it were seen with the measured lens itself.
Applications of this method are in any optical scenario, but we focus on the
context of autonomous driving, where quality of the detection algorithms
depends directly on the optical quality of the used camera system. With the
parameterization of the optical model we present a method to validate the
functional and safety limits of camera-based ADAS based on the real, measured
lens actually used in the product.

maintaining influential users as the social network evolves. We propose an
algorithm to probe the relationships (required for global influence

of a limited number of users during each probing period, based on the influence
trends and activities of the users. We infer the current network based on the
newly probed user data and the last known version of the network maintained
locally. Additionally, we propose to use link prediction methods to further
increase the accuracy of our network inference. We employ PageRank as the
metric for influence computation. We illustrate how the proposed solution
maintains accurate PageRank scores for computing global influence, and
topic-sensitive weighted PageRank scores for topic-based influence. The latter
relies on a topic-based network constructed via weights determined by semantic
analysis of posts and their sharing statistics. We evaluate the effectiveness
of our algorithms by comparing them with the true influence scores of the full

unit under test supports its own testing. To predict and improve software
testability, a large number of techniques and metrics have been proposed by
both practitioners and researchers in the last several decades. Reviewing and
getting an overview of the entire state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice in
this area is often challenging for a practitioner or a new researcher.
Objective: Our objective is to summarize the body of knowledge in this area and
to benefit the readers (both practitioners and researchers) in preparing,
measuring and improving software testability. Method: To address the above
need, the authors conducted a survey in the form of a systematic literature
mapping (classification) to find out what we as a community know about this
topic. After compiling an initial pool of 303 papers, and applying a set of
inclusion/exclusion criteria, our final pool included 208 papers. Results: The
area of software testability has been comprehensively studied by researchers
and practitioners. Approaches for measurement of testability and improvement of
testability are the most-frequently addressed in the papers. The two most often
mentioned factors affecting testability are observability and controllability.
Common ways to improve testability are testability transformation, improving
observability, adding assertions, and improving controllability. Conclusion:
This paper serves for both researchers and practitioners as an ""index"" to the

The values of Pugh and Poisson ratios suggested that the compound lies in the

dimensional, sparse and complex clinical data. Data science approaches
typically address this challenge by performing feature learning in order to
build more reliable and informative feature representations from clinical data
followed by supervised learning. In this paper, we propose a predictive
modeling approach based on deep learning based feature representations and word

sparse autoencoders, deep belief network, adversarial autoencoders and
variational autoencoders) for feature representation in higher-level
abstraction to obtain effective and robust features from EHRs, and then build
prediction models on top of them. Our approach is particularly useful when the
unlabeled data is abundant whereas labeled data is scarce. We investigate the
performance of representation learning through a supervised learning approach.
Our focus is to present a comparative study to evaluate the performance of
different deep architectures through supervised learning and provide insights
in the choice of deep feature representation techniques. Our experiments
demonstrate that for small data sets, stacked sparse autoencoder demonstrates a
superior generality performance in prediction due to sparsity regularization
whereas variational autoencoders outperform the competing approaches for large
data sets due to its capability of learning the representation distribution.

the joint epistatic interactions between SNPs and provide better insights into
phenotype expression. However, computational complexity is increased
exponentially as a function of higher-order combinations. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework, based on nonlinear transformations of
combinatorically large SNP data, using stacked autoencoders, to identify
higher-order SNP interactions. We focus on the challenging problem of
classifying preterm births. Evidence suggests that this complex condition has a
strong genetic component with unexplained heritability reportedly between
20%-40%. This claim is substantiated using a GWAS data set, obtained from
dbGap, which contains predominantly urban low-income African-American women who
had normal deliveries (between 37 and 42 weeks of gestation) and preterm
deliveries (less than 37 weeks of gestation). Latent representations from
original SNP sequences are used to initialize a deep learning classifier before
it is fine-tuned for classification tasks (term and preterm births). The
complete network models the epistatic effects of major and minor SNP
perturbations. All models are evaluated using standard binary classifier
performance metrics. The findings show that important information pertaining to
SNPs and epistasis can be extracted from 4666 raw SNPs generated using logistic

employing distributed antenna subarray architecture in which the transmitter

multiplexing gain formula is firstly derived when the numbers of antennas at
subarrays go to infinity. Specifically, assuming that all subchannels have the
same average number of propagation paths L, the formula implies that by
employing such a distributed antenna-subarray architecture, an exact average
maximum multiplexing gain of KrKtL can be achieved. This result means that
compared to the co-located antenna architecture, using the distributed
antenna-subarray architecture can scale up the maximum multiplexing gain
proportionally to KrKt. In order to further reveal the relation between
diversity gain and multiplexing gain, a simple characterization of the

is then extended to the multiuser scenario. Moreover, simulation results

published between 1962 and 1997. The initial research activity of Giulio was
concerned with virology and biological cybernetics while, from 1975 onward, his
work was completely devoted to protein crystallography. The crystallographic
research was carried out in collaboration with Nobel laureate Max Perutz at the
Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge
(United Kingdom). A short biography of Giulio (Judd) Fermi appears inside John

(CT-) active galactic nuclei (AGN) selected in the Swift-BAT 100-month survey.
The average redshift of these objects is $\langle z\rangle\sim$0.03 and they
all lie within $\sim$500 Mpc. We used the MyTorus (Murphy et al. 2009) model to
perform X-ray spectral fitting both without and with the contribution of the
NuSTAR data in the 3-50 keV energy range. When the NuSTAR data are added to the
fit, 14 out of 30 of these objects (47% of the whole sample) have intrinsic
absorption N$_{\rm H}<10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$ at the $>$3$\sigma$ confidence level,
i.e., they are re-classified from Compton thick to Compton thin. Consequently,
we infer an overall observed fraction of CT-AGN with respect to the whole AGN
population lower than the one reported in previous works, and as low as
$\sim$4%. We find evidence that this over-estimation of N$_{\rm H}$ is likely
due to the low quality of a subsample of spectra, either in the 2-10 keV band
or in the Swift-BAT one.

phenomena which signals the presence of new states of matter. Without prior
knowledge of the local order parameter, the quantum information metric (or
fidelity susceptibility) can indicate the presence of a phase transition as
well as it measures distance between quantum states. In this work, we calculate
the distance between quantum states which is equal to the fidelity
susceptibility in quantum model for a time-dependent system describing a
two-level atom coupled to a time-driven external field. As inspired by the
Landau-Zener quantum model, we find in the present work information metric
induced by fidelity susceptibility. We, for the first time, derive a
higher-order rank-3 tensor as a third-order fidelity susceptibility. Having
computed quantum noise function in this simple time-dependent model we show
that the noise function eternally lasts long in our model.

  Detecting Sociocognitive Roles in Multi-Party Interactions",,"Behavior Research Methods 2018","10.3758/s13428-018-1102-z",,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Roles are one of the most important concepts in understanding human
sociocognitive behavior. During group interactions, members take on different
roles within the discussion. Roles have distinct patterns of behavioral
engagement (i.e., active or passive, leading or following), contribution
characteristics (i.e., providing new information or echoing given material),
and social orientation (i.e., individual or group). Different combinations of
these roles can produce characteristically different group outcomes, being
either less or more productive towards collective goals. In online
collaborative learning environments, this can lead to better or worse learning
outcomes for the individual participants. In this study, we propose and
validate a novel approach for detecting emergent roles from the participants'
contributions and patterns of interaction. Specifically, we developed a group
communication analysis (GCA) by combining automated computational linguistic
techniques with analyses of the sequential interactions of online group
communication. The GCA was applied to three large collaborative interaction
datasets (participant N = 2,429; group N = 3,598). Cluster analyses and linear
mixed-effects modeling were used to assess the validity of the GCA approach and
the influence of learner roles on student and group performance. The results
indicate that participants' patterns in linguistic coordination and cohesion
are representative of the roles that individuals play in collaborative
discussions. More broadly, GCA provides a framework for researchers to explore
the micro intra- and interpersonal patterns associated with the participants'
roles and the sociocognitive processes related to successful collaboration.

  available",,"10.1080/17442508.2017.1371178",,"math.PR math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We construct Skorokhod decompositions for diffusions with singular drift and
reflecting boundary behavior on open subsets of $\mathbb R^d$ with $C^2$-smooth
boundary except for a sufficiently small set. This decomposition holds almost
surely under the path measures of the process for every starting point from an
explicitly known set. This set is characterized by the boundary smoothness and
the singularities of the drift term. We apply modern methods of Dirichlet form
theory and $\mathcal L^p$-strong Feller processes. These tools have been
approved as useful for the pointwise analysis of stochastic processes with
singular drift and various boundary conditions. Furthermore, we apply Sobolev
space theorems and elliptic regularity results to prove regularity properties
of potentials related to surface measures. These are important ingredients for
the pointwise construction of the boundary local time of the diffusions under
consideration. As an application we construct stochastic dynamics for particle
systems with hydrodynamic and pair interaction. Our approach allows highly
singular potentials like Lennard-Jones potentials and position-dependent
diffusion coefficients and thus the treatment of physically reasonable models.

achieve deep learning super-resolution under a large field of view (FOV). By
appropriately adopting prior microscopy data in an adversarial training, the
neural network can recover a high-resolution, accurate image of new specimen
from its single low-resolution measurement. Its capacity has been broadly
demonstrated via imaging various types of samples, such as USAF resolution
target, human pathological slides, fluorescence-labelled fibroblast cells, and
deep tissues in transgenic mouse brain, by both wide-field and light-sheet
microscopes. The gigapixel, multi-color reconstruction of these samples
verifies a successful GAN-based single image super-resolution procedure. We
also propose an image degrading model to generate low resolution images for
training, making our approach free from the complex image registration during
training dataset preparation. After a welltrained network being created, this
deep learning-based imaging approach is capable of recovering a large FOV (~95
mm2), high-resolution (~1.7 {\mu}m) image at high speed (within 1 second),
while not necessarily introducing any changes to the setup of existing
microscopes.
