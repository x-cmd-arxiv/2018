spread of infectious diseases. It starts with the simplest setting of a
homogeneous population in which a transmittable disease spreads during a short
outbreak. Assuming a large population some important features are presented:
branching process approximation, basic reproduction number $R_0$, and final
size of an outbreak. Some extensions towards realism are then discussed: models
for endemicity, various heterogeneities, and prior immmunity. The focus is then
shifted to statistical inference. What can be estimated for these models for
various levels of detailed data and with what precision? The paper ends by
describing how the inference results may be used for determining successful
vaccination strategies. This paper will appear as a chapter of a forthcoming

our proposed PUM, the three-dimensional domain is covered by overlapping
patches, with a compactly-supported, non-negative weight function, that is
identically equal to unity over some finite subset of its support associated
with each patch. This so-called flat-top property provides a pathway to devise
a stable approximation over the whole domain. On each patch, we use $p$-th
degree orthogonal polynomials that ensure $p$-th order completeness, and in
addition include eigenfunctions of the radial solution of the Schr\""odinger
equation. Furthermore, we adopt a variational lumping approach to construct a
block-diagonal overlap matrix that yields a standard eigenvalue problem and
demonstrate accuracy, stability and efficiency of the method.

tremendously in recent years and has shown remarkable potential for artificial
intelligence based opponents in computer games. This success is primarily due
to vast capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNet), enabling
algorithms to extract useful information from noisy environments. Capsule
Network (CapsNet) is a recent introduction to the Deep Learning algorithm group
and has only barely begun to be explored. The network is an architecture for
image classification, with superior performance for classification of the MNIST
dataset. CapsNets have not been explored beyond image classification.
  This thesis introduces the use of CapsNet for Q-Learning based game
algorithms. To successfully apply CapsNet in advanced game play, three main
contributions follow. First, the introduction of four new game environments as
frameworks for RL research with increasing complexity, namely Flash RL, Deep
Line Wars, Deep RTS, and Deep Maze. These environments fill the gap between
relatively simple and more complex game environments available for RL research
and are in the thesis used to test and explore the CapsNet behavior.
  Second, the thesis introduces a generative modeling approach to produce
artificial training data for use in Deep Learning models including CapsNets. We
empirically show that conditional generative modeling can successfully generate
game data of sufficient quality to train a Deep Q-Network well.
  Third, we show that CapsNet is a reliable architecture for Deep Q-Learning
based algorithms for game AI. A capsule is a group of neurons that determine
the presence of objects in the data and is in the literature shown to increase
the robustness of training and predictions while lowering the amount training
data needed. It should, therefore, be ideally suited for game plays.

processes by which pulsars turn off when they cross the ""death line."" However,
while ever more pulsars are found that exhibit nulling behavior, the
statistical techniques used to measure nulling are biased, with limited utility
and precision. In this paper we introduce an improved algorithm, based on
Gaussian mixture models, for measuring pulsar nulling behavior. We demonstrate
this algorithm on a number of pulsars observed as part of a larger sample of
nulling pulsars, and show that it performs considerably better than existing
techniques, yielding better precision and no bias. We further validate our
algorithm on simulated data. Our algorithm is widely applicable to a large
number of pulsars even if they do not show obvious nulls. Moreover, it can be
used to derive nulling probabilities of nulling for individual pulses, which
can be used for in-depth studies.

the natural environment. Strong OH-H2O bonds drive the formation of
partially-dissociated water dimers at low coverage, but a surface
reconstruction restricts the density of such species to one per unit cell. The
dimers act as an anchor for further water molecules as the coverage increases,
leading first to partially-dissociated water trimers, and then to a ring-like,
hydrogen-bonded network that covers the entire surface. Unraveling this
complexity requires the concerted application of several state-of-the-art
methods. Quantitative temperature programmed desorption (TPD) reveals the
coverage of stable structures, monochromatic x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy

environmental, and social systems under different conditions. Evacuation
simulation can be used to estimate the required time for people to exit a
building or evacuate disaster exposed regions. While building evacuation
simulation has seen significant study, city evacuation simulation is less
developed. For evacuation simulations using Agent-Based Models, the
characteristics of the underlying navigation algorithms are important in the
overall efficiency of the simulation. In some disasters, e.g. earthquakes,
evacuation takes place after the main event. This means evacuating and
navigating in an environment with damaged and collapsed buildings and bridges
and obstructed roads and paths. Furthermore, possible aftershocks or induced
phenomena, such as landslide and liquefaction, can render a more dynamic
situation for evacuees where the physical environment changes through time.
Evacuees, modeled as agents, require a reliable algorithm for their navigation
in these complex dynamic environments. A reliable navigation algorithm should
be capable of handling obstacles with different physical properties and
performing through dynamic environments. In this study, a framework is
introduced to evaluate the relative performance of agent navigation algorithms.
The main indices of this framework are Convergence, Optimality, Precision, and
Efficiency (COPE). The COPE framework is applied on a set of robot navigation
algorithms (the Bug Family) to assess their suitability to be used as
pedestrian navigation algorithms.

along with the dynamic fields that are generated. In an effort to fill this
gap, we develop a simulation methodology that self-consistently couples AC
non-equilibrium Green functions (NEGF) with the full solution of Maxwell's
equations in the frequency domain. We apply this technique to simulate
radiation from a quantum-confined, quarter-wave, monopole antenna where the
length $L$ is equal to one quarter of the wavelength, $\lambda_0$. Classically,
such an antenna would have a narrower, more directed radiation pattern compared
to one with $L \ll \lambda_0$, but we find that a quantum quarter-wave antenna
has no directivity gain compared to the classical solution. We observe that the
quantized wave function within the antenna significantly alter the charge and
current density distribution along the length of the wire, which in turn
modifies the far-field radiation pattern from the antenna. These results show
that high-frequency radiation from quantum systems can be markedly different
from classical expectations. Our method, therefore, will enable accurate
modeling of the next generation of high-speed nanoscale electronic devices.

momentum in 2017 when two different quasipolynomial time algorithms were

was presented as an improvement over a previous algorithm called the small
progress measure algorithm, using a better data structure.
  The starting point of this paper is the observation that the underlying data
structure for both progress measure algorithms are (subgraph-)universal trees.
We show that in fact any universal tree gives rise to a value iteration
algorithm \`a la succinct progress measure, and the complexity of the algorithm
is proportional to the size of the chosen universal tree. We then show that
both algorithms are instances of this generic algorithm for two constructions
of universal trees, the first of exponential size (for small progress measure)
and the second of quasipolynomial size (for succinct progress measure).
  The technical result of this paper is to show that the latter construction is
asymptotically tight: universal trees have at least quasipolynomial size. This
suggests that the succinct progress measure algorithm of Jurdzi\'nski and
Lazi\'c is in this framework optimal, and that the polynomial time algorithm
for parity games is hiding someplace else.

observables tied to a specific choice of geometrical clocks. As examples, we
show that the Bardeen potentials and the Mukhanov-Sasaki variable emerge

invariant variables for various gauges can be systematically obtained. We
demonstrate this by analyzing five common gauge choices: longitudinal,
spatially flat, uniform field, synchronous and comoving gauge. For all these,
we apply the observable map in the context of the relational formalism and
obtain the corresponding Dirac observables associated with these choices of

canonical cosmological perturbation theory twofold. On the one hand we can
include also gauges that can only be analyzed in the context of the extended
ADM-phase space and furthermore, we obtain a set of natural gauge invariant
variables, namely the Dirac observables, for each considered choice of gauge
conditions. Our analysis provides insights on which clocks should be used to
extract the relevant natural physical observables both at the classical and

visual system works in naturalistic environments. These databases describe the
sensitivity of many observers to a wide range of distortions (of different
nature and with different suprathreshold intensities) seen on top of a variety
of natural images. They seem like a dream for the vision scientist to check the
models in realistic scenarios.
  However, while these natural databases are great benchmarks for models
developed in some other way (e.g. by using the well-controlled artificial
stimuli of traditional psychophysics), they should be carefully used when
trying to fit vision models. Given the high dimensionality of the image space,
it is very likely that some basic phenomenon (e.g. sensitivity to distortions
in certain environments) are under-represented in the database. Therefore, a
model fitted on these large-scale natural databases will not reproduce these
under-represented basic phenomena that could otherwise be easily illustrated
with well selected artificial stimuli.
  In this work we study a specific example of the above statement. A
wavelet+divisive normalization layer of a sensible cascade of linear+nonlinear
layers fitted to maximize the correlation with subjective opinion of observers
on a large image quality database fails to reproduce basic crossmasking. Here
we outline a solution for this problem using artificial stimuli. Then, we show
that the resulting model is also a competitive solution for the large-scale
database. In line with Rust and Movshon (2005), our report (misrepresentation
of basic visual phenomena in subjectively-rated natural image databases) is an
additional argument in praise of artifice.

developed by Galleas and the author. We first explain the method using the
simplest example: the computation of the partition function for the six-vertex
model with domain-wall boundary conditions. At the heart of the method lies a
linear functional equation for the partition function. After deriving this
equation we outline its analysis. The result is a closed expression in the form
of a symmetrized sum - or, equivalently, multiple-integral formula - that can
be rewritten to recover Izergin's determinant. Special attention is paid to the
relation with other approaches. In particular we show that the Korepin--Izergin
approach can be recovered within the functional method. We comment on the
functional method's range of applicability, and review how it is adapted to the
technically more involved example of the elliptic solid-on-solid model with
domain walls and a reflecting end. We present a new formula for the partition
function of the latter, which was expressed as a determinant by
Tsuchiya--Filali--Kitanine. Our result takes the form of a
'crossing-symmetrized' sum with $2^L$ terms featuring the elliptic domain-wall
partition function, which appears to be new also in the limiting case of the
six-vertex model. Further taking the rational limit we recover the expression
obtained by Frassek using the boundary perimeter Bethe ansatz.

stability estimates for features which are sensitive to horizontal transfer
between families and whenever data are aggregated from families of divergent
time depths. To overcome these problems, we describe a method of stability
estimation without family classifications, based on mathematical modelling and
the analysis of contemporary geospatial distributions of linguistic features.
Regressing the estimates produced by our model against those of a genealogical

of serial episodes from a streaming sequence has drawn continuous attention in
academia due to its wide application in practice, e.g., telecommunication
alarms, stock market, transaction logs, bioinformatics, etc. Although a number
of serial episodes mining algorithms have been developed recently, most of them
are neither stream-oriented, as they require multi-pass of dataset, nor
time-aware, as they fail to take into account the time constraint of serial
episodes. In this paper, we propose two novel one-pass algorithms, ONCE and
ONCE+, each of which can respectively compute two popular frequencies of given
episodes satisfying predefined time-constraint as signals in a stream arrives
one-after-another. ONCE is only used for non-overlapped frequency where the
occurrences of a serial episode in sequence are not intersected. ONCE+ is
designed for the distinct frequency where the occurrences of a serial episode
do not share any event. Theoretical study proves that our algorithm can
correctly mine the frequency of target time constraint serial episodes in a
given stream. Experimental study over both real-world and synthetic datasets
demonstrates that the proposed algorithm can work, with little time and space,
in signal-intensive streams where millions of signals arrive within a single
second. Moreover, the algorithm has been applied in a real stream processing
system, where the efficacy and efficiency of this work is tested in practical
applications.

general. It turns out that, due to large internal gauge flux, the remaining
integrals localise around certain points on the compactification manifold and
can, hence, be calculated approximately without precise knowledge of the
Ricci-flat Calabi-Yau metric. In a final step, we show how this local result
can be expressed in terms of the global moduli of the Calabi-Yau manifold. The

method takes as an input a foreground image and improves the object detection

foreground blobs from background subtraction. The first step is to create
foreground images for all the frames in an urban video. Then, starting from the
original blobs of the foreground image, we merge the blobs that are close to
one another and that have similar optical flow. The next step is extracting the
edges of the different objects to detect multiple objects that might be very
close (and be merged in the same blob) and to adjust the size of the original
blobs. At the same time, we use the optical flow to detect occlusion of objects
that are moving in opposite directions. Finally, we make a decision on which
information we keep in order to construct a new foreground image with blobs
that can be used for tracking. The system is validated on four videos of an
urban traffic dataset. Our method improves the recall and precision metrics for
the object detection task compared to the vanilla background subtraction method

unbiasedly estimate a causal effect in presence of unmeasured confounding. MR
is being widely used in epidemiology and other related areas of population
science. In this paper, we study statistical inference in the increasingly
popular two-sample summary-data MR design. We show a linear model for the
observed associations approximately holds in a wide variety of settings when
all the genetic variants satisfy the exclusion restriction assumption, or in
genetic terms, when there is no pleiotropy. In this scenario, we derive a
maximum profile likelihood estimator with provable consistency and asymptotic
normality. However, through analyzing real datasets, we find strong evidence of
both systematic and idiosyncratic pleiotropy in MR, echoing the omnigenic model
of complex traits that is recently proposed in genetics. We model the
systematic pleiotropy by a random effects model, where no genetic variant
satisfies the exclusion restriction condition exactly. In this case we propose
a consistent and asymptotically normal estimator by adjusting the profile
score. We then tackle the idiosyncratic pleiotropy by robustifying the adjusted
profile score. We demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed

departure and arrival time choices are driven by their scheduling payoff
choice. With a single tube or imaginary road model, we convert the nonlocal
day-to-day arrival time shifting problem to a local scheduling payoff shifting
problem. After introducing a new variable for the imaginary density, we apply
the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model to describe the day-to-day dynamics
of scheduling payoff choice and present splitting and cost balancing schemes to
determine arrival and departure flow-rates accordingly. We also develop the
corresponding discrete models for numerical solutions. We theoretically prove
that the day-to-day stationary state of the LWR model leads to the scheduling
payoff user equilibrium (SPUE), which is equivalent to both DTUE and ATUE and
stable. We use one numerical example to demonstrate the effectiveness and
stability of the new day-to-day dynamical model.

inequality. There are two reasons to test the OB inequality and not the CHSH
inequality. First of all, the OB inequality is a straightforward consequence to
the EPR-argumentation. And only this inequality is related to the EPR-Bohr
debate. However, the last statement can be objected by some experts working in
quantum foundations. Therefore to convince experimenters to perform the
OB-violation experiment, we prefer to concentrate on the second distinguishing
feature of the OB inequality which was emphasized by I. Pitowsky. He pointed
out that the OB inequality provides a higher degree of violations of
classicality than the CHSH inequality. The main problem is that the OB
inequality is derived under the assumption of perfect (anti-) correlations.
However, the last years were characterized by the amazing development of
quantum technologies. Nowadays, there exist sources producing with very high
probability the pairs of photons in the singlet state. Moreover, the efficiency
of photon detectors was improved tremendously. In any event one can start by
proceeding with the fair sampling assumption. Another possibility is to use the
scheme of Hensen et al. experiment for entangled electrons.

assumes that all the failed nodes are recreated in one location, while the

repair bandwidth.
  As our first result, we prove a lower bound on the minimum bandwidth of
cooperative repair. We also show that the cooperative model is stronger than
the centralized one, in the sense that any MDS code with optimal repair
bandwidth under the former model also has optimal bandwidth under the latter
one. These results were previously known under the additional ""uniform

  As our main result, we give explicit constructions of MDS codes with optimal

the field $F$ of size $|F|\ge (d+1-k)n$ that can optimally repair any $h$
erasures from any $d$ helper nodes. The repair scheme of our codes involves two
rounds of communication. In the first round, each failed node downloads
information from the helper nodes, and in the second one, each failed node
downloads additional information from the other failed nodes. This implies that
our codes achieve the optimal repair bandwidth using the smallest possible

via a sequence of noisy evaluations. Typically, the observation noise is
assumed to be independent of the evaluation point and to satisfy a tail bound
uniformly on the domain; a restrictive assumption for many applications. In
this work, we consider bandits with heteroscedastic noise, where we explicitly
allow the noise distribution to depend on the evaluation point. We show that
this leads to new trade-offs for information and regret, which are not taken
into account by existing approaches like upper confidence bound algorithms
(UCB) or Thompson Sampling. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a
frequentist regret analysis framework, that is similar to the Bayesian
framework of Russo and Van Roy (2014), and we prove a new high-probability
regret bound for general, possibly randomized policies, which depends on a
quantity we refer to as regret-information ratio. From this bound, we define a
frequentist version of Information Directed Sampling (IDS) to minimize the
regret-information ratio over all possible action sampling distributions. This
further relies on concentration inequalities for online least squares
regression in separable Hilbert spaces, which we generalize to the case of
heteroscedastic noise. We then formulate several variants of IDS for linear and
reproducing kernel Hilbert space response functions, yielding novel algorithms
for Bayesian optimization. We also prove frequentist regret bounds, which in
the homoscedastic case recover known bounds for UCB, but can be much better
when the noise is heteroscedastic. Empirically, we demonstrate in a linear
setting with heteroscedastic noise, that some of our methods can outperform UCB

to denoise ASL MRI but only provide moderate improvement. Deep learning (DL) is
an emerging technique that can learn the most representative signal from data
without prior modeling which can be highly complex and analytically
indescribable. The purpose of this study was to assess whether the record
breaking performance of DL can be translated into ASL MRI denoising. We used
convolutional neural network (CNN) to build the DL ASL denosing model (DL-ASL)
to inherently consider the inter-voxel correlations. To better guide DL-ASL
training, we incorporated prior knowledge about ASL MRI: the structural
similarity between ASL CBF map and grey matter probability map. A relatively
large sample data were used to train the model which was subsequently applied
to a new set of data for testing. Experimental results showed that DL-ASL
achieved state-of-the-art denoising performance for ASL MRI as compared to
current routine methods in terms of higher SNR, keeping CBF quantification
quality while shorten the acquisition time by 75%, and automatic partial volume
correction.

applications in signal processing. An important property of a frame is its
coherence, a measure of how close any two vectors of the frame are to each
other. Low coherence frames are useful in compressed sensing applications. When
used as measurement matrices, they successfully recover highly sparse solutions
to linear inverse problems. This paper describes algorithms for the design of
various low coherence frame types: real, complex, unital (constant magnitude)
complex, sparse real and complex, nonnegative real and complex, and harmonic
(selection of rows from Fourier matrices). The proposed methods are based on
solving a sequence of convex optimization problems that update each vector of
the frame. This update reduces the coherence with the other frame vectors,
while other constraints on its entries are also imposed. Numerical experiments
show the effectiveness of the methods compared to the Welch bound, as well as
other competing algorithms, in compressed sensing applications.

the inner halo, resulting in a tight correlation between the dark matter and
baryon distributions. A deep baryonic potential shortens the phase of SIDM core
expansion and triggers core contraction. This effect can be further enhanced by
a large self-scattering cross section. We find the final SIDM density profile
is sensitive to the baryonic concentration and the strength of dark matter
self-interactions. Assuming a spherical initial halo, we also study evolution
of the SIDM halo shape together with the density profile. The halo shape at
later epochs deviates from spherical symmetry due to the influence of the
non-spherical disc potential, and its significance depends on the baryonic
contribution to the total gravitational potential, relative to the dark matter
one. In addition, we construct a multi-component model for the Milky Way,

into account production, propagation and interactions of cosmic rays. The model
reproduces the observed gamma-ray luminosities of nearby galaxies detected by

$\psi M_{\rm gas}$. Then this model is used to predict the cosmic background
flux of gamma-ray and neutrinos from star-forming galaxies, by using a
semi-analytical model of cosmological galaxy formation that reproduces many
observed quantities of local and high-redshift galaxies. Calibration of the
model using gamma-ray luminosities of nearby galaxies allows us to make a more
reliable prediction than previous studies. In our baseline model star-forming
galaxies produce about 20% of isotropic gamma-ray background unresolved by {\it

mass, edge-on star forming spiral currently falling into the core of the Virgo
cluster. New deep observations revealed a low surface brightness 10 kpc tail
exhibiting a peculiar filamentary structure. The filaments are remarkably
parallel one another and clearly indicate the direction of motion of the galaxy
in the Virgo potential. Motivated by the detection of these features,
indicating ongoing gas stripping, we collected literature photometry in 15
bands from the far-UV to the far-IR and deep optical long slit spectroscopy
using the FORS2 instrument at the ESO Very Large Telescope. Using a newly
developed Monte Carlo code that jointly fits spectroscopy and photometry, we
reconstructed the star formation histories in apertures along the major axis of
the galaxy. Our results have been validated against the output of CIGALE, a
fitting code which has been previously used for similar studies. We found a
clear outside-in gradient with radius of the time when the quenching event
started: the outermost radii have been stripped 500 Myr ago, while the
stripping has reached the inner 5 kpc from the center in the last 100 Myr.
Regions at even smaller radii are currently still forming stars fueled by the
presence of HI and H2 gas. When compared to statistical studies of the
quenching timescales in the local Universe we find that ram pressure stripping
of the cold gas is an effective mechanism to reduce the transformation times
for galaxies falling into massive clusters. Future systematic studies of all
the active galaxies observed by VESTIGE in the Virgo cluster will extend these
results to a robust statistical framework.

size, unlike the ancient infalls. The kinematics of the spectroscopically

UDGs have a predominantly accretion origin from the field, acquire velocities
corresponding to the mass of the cluster at accretion as they are accelerated
towards the cluster center, and become redder and bigger as they experience the
various physical processes at work within the cluster.

colours, there is a large spread in vacuum UV colour consistent with almost all
having some UV upturn component. Combining GALEX and UVOT data below 3000\AA,
we generate for the first time comparatively detailed UV SEDs for Coma cluster
galaxies. Fitting the UV upturn component with a blackbody, twenty six of these
show a range of characteristic temperatures (10000--21000K) for the UV upturn
population. Assuming a single temperature to explain GALEX-optical colours
could underestimate the fraction of galaxies with UV upturns and mis-classify
some as systems with residual star formation. The UV upturn phenomenon is not
an exclusive feature found only in giant galaxies; we identify galaxies with
similar (or even bluer) $FUV-V$ colours to the giants with upturns over a range
of fainter luminosities. The temperature and strength of the UV upturn are
correlated with galaxy mass. Under the plausible hypothesis that the sources of
the UV upturn are blue horizontal branch stars, the most likely mechanism for
this is the presence of a substantial (between 4\% and 20\%) Helium rich ($Y >

and certainly at $z>2$; this plausibly sets a lower limit of $\sim {\rm 0.3 -

spectrograph covering the central 50""x50"" of NGC7252 to map the stellar and
ionised gas kinematics, and the distribution and conditions of the ionised gas,
revealing the extent of ongoing star formation and recent star formation
history. We find that the inner gas disc is not counter-rotating with respect
to the stars and that the stellar kinematics appear complex with a clear
indication of a prolate-like rotation component suggesting a polar merger
configuration. The ongoing star formation rate is 2.2+-0.6 M_sun/yr and implies
a typical depletion time of 2Gyr given the molecular gas content. Furthermore,
the spatially-resolved star formation history suggests a slight radial
dependence, moving outwards at later times. We confirm a large AGN-ionised gas
cloud previously discovered 5kpc south of the nucleus, and find higher
ionisation also at the galaxy centre relative to the surrounding gas disc.
Although the higher ionisation towards the centre is potentially degenerate
within the central star forming ring, it may be associated with a
low-luminosity AGN. Although NGC7252 has been classified as post-starburst
galaxy at the centre, the elliptical-like major-merger remnant still appears
very active. A central kpc-scale gas disc has presumably re-formed quickly
within the last 100Myr after final coalescence. The disc features ongoing star
formation, implying Gyr long timescale to reach the red sequence through gas
consumption alone. While NGC7252 is useful to probe the transformation from
discs to ellipticals, it is not well-suited to study the transformation from
blue to red at this point.

with median cadences of 1.0 and 0.6 days for MCG+08-11-011 and NGC\,2617,
respectively, combined with roughly daily X-ray and near-UV data from Swift for
NGC 2617. We find lags consistent with geometrically thin accretion-disk models
that predict a lag-wavelength relation of $\tau \propto \lambda^{4/3}$.
However, the observed lags are larger than predictions based on standard
thin-disk theory by factors of 3.3 for MCG+08-11-011 and 2.3 for NGC\,2617.
These differences can be explained if the mass accretion rates are larger than
inferred from the optical luminosity by a factor of 4.3 in MCG+08-11-011 and a
factor of 1.3 in NGC\,2617, although uncertainty in the SMBH masses determines
the significance of this result. While the X-ray variability in NGC\,2617
precedes the UV/optical variability, the long 2.6 day lag is problematic for
coronal reprocessing models.

the EBL from FIR to TeV gamma-rays by using FIR emissivities from our previous

QSOs and blazars. For public use, we also provide the EBL models obtained using
different QSO SEDs at extreme-UV energies over a wide range of redshifts. These

consistent with being the continuity of the stellar mass scaling relations of
more massive galaxies. These UDGs' star formation histories imply a relatively
recent infall into the Coma cluster, consistent with the theoretical
predictions for a dwarf-like origin. However, considering the scatter in the
resulting properties and including other UDGs in Coma, together with the
results from the velocity phase-space study of the Paper I in this series, a
mixed-bag of origins is needed to explain the nature of all UDGs. Our results
thus reinforce a scenario in which many UDGs are field dwarfs that become

UDGs could be genuine primordial galaxies that failed to develop due to an

these values to derive the abundance of 11 chemical elements in the stellar

macroturbulent velocity were obtained using temperature calibrators and
synthetic line profiles to match the observed spectra of five absorption lines.
Finally, by interpolating in a grid of MIST isochrones, we derived the mass,
radius and age using a Bayesian approach. SPECIES obtains bulk parameters that
are in good agreement with measured values from different existing catalogues,
including when different methods are used to derive them. We find excellent
agreement with previous works that used similar methodologies. We find
discrepancies in the chemical abundances for some elements with respect to
other works, which could be produced by differences in $T_{\text{eff}}$, or in
the line list or the atomic line data used to derive them. We also obtained
analytic relations to describe the correlations between different parameters,

is thought to be produced by major mergers, the existence of a
$M_{\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\star}$ relation, across all galaxy morphological types,
suggests that BHs may be largely built by secular processes. Recent evidence
that bulge-less galaxies, which are unlikely to have had significant mergers,
are offset from the $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\mathrm{Bulge}}$ relation, but lie
on the $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\star}$ relation, has strengthened this
hypothesis. Nevertheless, the small size and heterogeneity of current datasets,
coupled with the difficulty in measuring precise BH masses, makes it
challenging to address this issue using empirical studies alone. Here, we use
Horizon-AGN, a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to probe the role of
mergers in BH growth over cosmic time. We show that (1) as suggested by
observations, simulated bulge-less galaxies lie offset from the main
$M_{\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\mathrm{Bulge}}$ relation, but on the
$M_{\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\star}$ relation, (2) the positions of galaxies on the

histories and (3) only $\sim$35 per cent of the BH mass in today's massive
galaxies is directly attributable to merging -- the majority ($\sim$65 per
cent) of BH growth, therefore, takes place gradually, via secular processes,
over cosmic time.

sign of active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback in action. However, the physical
mechanism responsible for driving the observed outflows remains unclear, and
whether it is due to momentum, energy, or radiation is still a matter of
debate. The observed outflow energetics, in particular the large measured
values of the momentum ratio ($\dot{p}/(L/c) \sim 10$) and energy ratio
($\dot{E}_k/L \sim 0.05$), seems to favour the energy-driving mechanism; and
most observational works have focused their comparison with wind energy-driven
models. Here we show that AGN radiation pressure on dust can adequately
reproduce the observed outflow energetics (mass outflow rate, momentum flux,
and kinetic power), as well as the scalings with luminosity, provided that the
effects of radiation trapping are properly taken into account. In particular,
we predict a sub-linear scaling for the mass outflow rate ($\dot{M} \propto
L^{1/2}$) and a super-linear scaling for the kinetic power ($\dot{E}_k \propto
L^{3/2}$), in agreement with the observational scaling relations reported in
the most recent compilation of AGN outflow data. We conclude that AGN radiative
feedback can account for the global outflow energetics, at least equally well
as the wind energy-driving mechanism, and therefore both physical models should
be considered in the interpretation of future AGN outflow observations.

that the constraints on photon-axion coupling and primordial magnetic fields
are much weaker than previously claimed for low mass axion like particles with
masses $m_{\rm a} \lesssim 5\times 10^{-13}\,\text{eV}$. In particular we find
that the axion mass range $10^{-14}\,\text{eV} \le m_{\rm a} \le 5\times
10^{-13}\,\text{eV}$ is not excluded by the CMB data contrary to the previous
claims. We also examine the photon-axion conversion in the Galactic magnetic
fields. Resonant conversion in the large scale coherent Galactic magnetic field
results in $100\%$ polarized anisotropic spectral distortions of the CMB for
the mass range $10^{-13}\,\text{eV} \lesssim m_{\rm a} \lesssim
10^{-11}\,\text{eV}$. The polarization pattern traces the transverse to line of
sight component of the Galactic magnetic field while both the anisotropy in the
Galactic magnetic field and electron distribution imprint a characteristic
anisotropy pattern in the spectral distortion. Our results apply to scalar as
well as pseudoscalar particles. For conversion to scalar particles, the
polarization is rotated by $90^{\circ}$ allowing us to distinguish them from
the pseudoscalars. For $m_{\rm a} \lesssim 10^{-14} \,\text{eV}$ we have
non-resonant conversion in the small scale turbulent magnetic field of the
Galaxy resulting in anisotropic but unpolarized spectral distortion in the CMB.
These unique signatures are potential discriminants against the isotropic and
non-polarized signals such as primary CMB, and $\mu$ and $y$ distortions with
the anisotropic nature making it accessible to experiments with only relative
calibration like Planck, LiteBIRD, and CORE. We forecast for PIXIE as well as
for these experiments using Fisher matrix formalism.

result from a distinction in the architecture between multi-transiting systems

as the Kepler dichotomy. In this paper, we investigate the hypothesis that
external giant planets are the main cause behind the over-abundance of single-
relative to multi-transiting systems, which would be signaled by higher
metallicities in the former sample. To this end, we perform a statistical
analysis on the stellar metallicity distribution with respect to planet
multiplicity in the Kepler data. We perform our analysis on a variety of
samples taken from a population of 1166 Kepler main sequence planetary hosts,
using precisely determined metallicities from the California-Kepler survey and
Swift et al. (2015). Contrary to some predictions, we do not find a significant
difference between the stellar metallicities of the single- and
multiple-transiting planet systems. However, we do find a 55% upper bound for
systems with a single non-giant planet that could also host a hidden giant
planet, based on metallicity considerations. While the presence of external
giant planets might be one factor behind the Kepler dichotomy, our results also
favor alternative explanations. We suggest that additional radial velocity and

improvements in the training process and in the generated outputs, these inputs

to reduce memory requirements. In this way, our network learns to generate

$\sim~100$ days, resembling the radio flare predicted to arise from the
interaction of a binary neutron star merger outflow with the ISM
\citep{nakar2011}. Considering a blast wave moving with a Lorentz factor
$\Gamma$, we show that an off-axis observer, namely an observer at
$\theta_{obs}>1/\Gamma$, sees a light curve rising faster than $F_\nu\propto
t^3$. Therefore, the observed rise, $F_\nu\propto~t^{0.78}$, implies that at
all times we have seen an on-axis emission. Namely, the emitting matter was
within $\theta_{obs}<1/\Gamma$ at the time of observations (even if it was
off-axis beforehand). The observations tightly constrain the blast wave Lorentz
factor: $\Gamma\sim(1.5-7)(t/10~{\rm day})^{-0.21}$.The isotropic equivalent
energy in the observed region increases with time,
$E_{iso}\sim~10^{50}{\rm~erg} ~(t/150~{\rm day})^{1.3}$, implying that the
outflow was structured. The energy increase can arise from a slower material
moving behind the blast wave or from a matter moving at larger angles that has
slowed down. Such a structure could have different origins, however, the only
physically motivated one, proposed so far, is the interaction of a relativistic
jet with the ejecta and the resulting cocoon. The jet could have been choked or
successful. In the latter case, it has produced a short GRB pointing elsewhere
(this successful jet-cocoon system is sometimes called a ""structured jet"").
Although circumstantial evidence disfavors a successful jet, the jet fate
cannot be decisively determined from current observations. The light curve
alone may not be sufficient to resolve this question, since both chocked and
successful jets can lead to a gradual rise to a peak, followed by a decay.
Therefore, the recent turnover of the light curve does not necessitate a
successful jet.

By the incorporation of limited-energy advection in the hyper-accretion discs,
outflows occur naturally from accretion flows due to imbalance between the
viscous heating and the sum of the advective and radiative cooling. Following
this spirit, we revisit the properties of the merger outflow ejecta. Our
results show that around $10^{-3} \sim 10^{-1} M_\odot$ of the disc mass can be
launched as powerful outflows. The amount of unbound mass varies with the disc
mass and the viscosity. The outflow-contributed peak luminosity is around
$10^{40} \sim 10^{41}$ erg/s. Such a scenario can account for the observed

the machine delivers as high as possible collision rates. As a consequence,
multiple proton-proton collisions occur whenever two bunches cross. Interesting
high-energy (hard) collisions are therefore contaminated by several soft,
zero-bias, ones. This effect known as pileup pollutes the final state of the
collision. It complicates the reconstruction of the objects in this final
state, resulting in increased experimental uncertainties. To reduce these
uncertainties, and improve the quality and precision of LHC measurements,
techniques are devised to correct for the effects of pileup. This document
provides a theoretical review of the main methods used during Run I and II of
the LHC to mitigate pileup effects. I start with an in-depth presentation of
the area--median used for the majority of applications, including several
refinements of the original idea, their practical implementation and an
assessment of their efficiency and robustness. I then focus on several
theoretical calculations that can provide both quantitative and qualitative
information on the area--median approach. In the case of boosted jets, a field
that has seen a wide interest recently, a set of methods, known as grooming
techniques has also been used. I describe these techniques, address their
performance and briefly show that they are amenable to a theoretical, analytic,
understanding. The last part of this review focuses on ideas oriented towards
future pileup mitigation techniques. This includes new methods that have
recently been proposed as well as a large series of alternative ideas. The
latter are yet unpublished and have not received the same amount of
investigation than the former but they have the potential to bring new
developments and further improvement over existing techniques in a future where
pileup mitigation will be crucial.

develop algorithms for automatic classification of variable stars. That has
been primarily achieved by applying machine learning methods to photometric
datasets where objects are represented as light curves. Classifiers require
training sets to learn the underlying patterns that allow the separation among
classes. Unfortunately, building training sets is an expensive process that
demands a lot of human efforts. Every time data comes from new surveys; the
only available training instances are the ones that have a cross-match with
previously labelled objects, consequently generating insufficient training sets
compared with the large amounts of unlabelled sources. In this work, we present
an algorithm that performs unsupervised classification of variable stars,
relying only on the similarity among light curves. We tackle the unsupervised
classification problem by proposing an untraditional approach. Instead of
trying to match classes of stars with clusters found by a clustering algorithm,
we propose a query based method where astronomers can find groups of variable
stars ranked by similarity. We also develop a fast similarity function specific
for light curves, based on a novel data structure that allows scaling the
search over the entire dataset of unlabelled objects. Experiments show that our
unsupervised model achieves high accuracy in the classification of different
types of variable stars and that the proposed algorithm scales up to massive
amounts of light curves.

performance of communication systems. In wideband systems, such as cognitive
radios, noise at the receiver can originate from non-linearity present in the
RF front end, time-varying thermal noise within the receiver radio system, and
noise from adjacent network nodes. Several denoising techniques have been
proposed for cognitive radios, some of which are applied during spectrum

some of these techniques used for noise cancellation in received signals are
least mean square (LMS) and its variants. However, these algorithms have low
performance with non-linear signals and cannot locate a global optimum solution
for noise cancellation. Therefore, application of global search optimization
techniques, such as evolutionary algorithms, is considered for noise
cancellation. In this paper, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and LMS
algorithms are implemented and their performances are evaluated. Extensive
simulations were performed where Gaussian and non-linear random noise were
added to the transmitted signal. The performance comparison was done using two
metrics: bit error rate and mean square error. The results show that PSO

communication system, as noise affects data integrity. In existing systems,
traditional filters are used to cancel the noise from the received signals.
These filters use fixed hardware which is capable of filtering specific
frequency or a range of frequencies. However, next generation communication
technologies, such as cognitive radio, will require the use of adaptive filters
that can dynamically reconfigure their filtering parameters for any frequency.
To this end, a few noise cancellation techniques have been proposed, including
least mean squares (LMS) and its variants. However, these algorithms are
susceptible to non-linear noise and fail to locate the global optimum solution
for de-noising. In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of two global
search optimization based algorithms, genetic algorithm and particle swarm
optimization in performing noise cancellation in cognitive radio systems. These
algorithms are implemented and their performances are compared to that of LMS
using bit error rate and mean square error as performance evaluation metrics.
Simulations are performed with additive white Gaussian noise and random
nonlinear noise. Results indicate that GA and PSO perform better than LMS for
the case of AWGN corrupted signal but for non-linear random noise PSO
outperforms the other two algorithms.

these three issues. Instead of adding a universal bulk scalar mass to avoid
tachyonic sleptons, we add distinct Higgs and matter scalar soft masses which
then allow for light higgsinos. To gain accord with the measured Higgs mass, we
also include a bulk trilinear soft term. The ensuing natural generalized AMSB
(nAMSB) model then has a set of light higgsinos with mass nearby the weak scale
m(W,Z,h)~100 GeV as required by naturalness while the winos populate the
several hundred GeV range and gluinos and squarks occupy the multi-TeV range.
For LHC searches, the wino pair production followed by decay to same-sign
diboson signature channel offers excellent prospects for discovery at high
luminosity LHC along with higgsino pair production leading to soft dileptons
plus jet(s)+MET. A linear e^+e^- collider operating above higgsino pair

from unified or mirage unified scenarios. Dark matter is expected to occur as a

smaller than ~ 5 kpc) that are unpolarized at 1.4 GHz in the NVSS. Total
intensity data have been modelled using combination of synchrotron components,
revealing complex structure in their radio spectra. Depolarization modelling,
through the so called qu-fitting, have been performed on the polarized data
using an equation that attempts to simplify the process of fitting many
different depolarization models that we can divide into two major categories:
External Depolarization and Internal Depolarization models. Understanding which
of the two mechanisms are the most representative, would help the qualitative
understanding of the AGN jet environment, whether it is embedded in a dense
external magnetoionic medium or if it is the jet-wind that causes the high RM
and strong depolarization. This could help to probe the jet magnetic field
geometry (e.g. helical or otherwise). This new high-sensitivity data, shows a
complicated behaviour in the total intensity and polarization radio spectrum of
individual sources. We observed the presence of several synchrotron components
and Faraday components in their total intensity and polarized spectra. For the
majority of our targets, (12 sources) the depolarization seems to be caused by
a turbulent magnetic field. Thus, our main selection criteria (lack of
polarization at 1.4 GHz in the NVSS), results in a sample of sources with very
large RMs and depolarization due to turbulent magnetic fields local to the
source. We show how the new qu-fitting technique can be used to probe the
magnetised radio source environment and to spectrally resolve the polarized
components of unresolved radio sources.

the astronomical target selection process. Most surveys generate a vast amount
of time series, or \quotes{lightcurves}, that represent the brightness
variability of stellar objects in time. Unfortunately, lightcurves'
observations take several years to be completed, producing truncated time
series that generally remain without the application of automatic classifiers
until they are finished. This happens because state of the art methods rely on
a variety of statistical descriptors or features that present an increasing
degree of dispersion when the number of observations decreases, which reduces
their precision. In this paper we propose a novel method that increases the
performance of automatic classifiers of variable stars by incorporating the
deviations that scarcity of observations produces. Our method uses Gaussian
Process Regression to form a probabilistic model of each lightcurve's
observations. Then, based on this model, bootstrapped samples of the time
series features are generated. Finally a bagging approach is used to improve
the overall performance of the classification. We perform tests on the MACHO
and OGLE catalogs, results show that our method classifies effectively some
variability classes using a small fraction of the original observations. For
example, we found that RR Lyrae stars can be classified with around 80\% of
accuracy just by observing the first 5\% of the whole lightcurves' observations
in MACHO and OGLE catalogs. We believe these results prove that, when studying
lightcurves, it is important to consider the features' error and how the
measurement process impacts it.

enable supervised learning models to be trained successfully. However, when

drops significantly. Furthermore, unlabeled data becomes available at a much

significantly affect the final distribution of giant planets by modifying gas
surface density and hence Type II migration rates near the photoevaporation
gap. We first use an analytic disk model to demonstrate that newly-formed giant
planets have a long migration epoch before photoevaporation can significantly
alter their migration rates. Next we present new 2-D hydrodynamic simulations
of planets migrating in photoevaporating disks, each paired with a control
simulation of migration in an otherwise identical disk without
photoevaporation. We show that in disks with surface densities near the minimum
threshold for forming giant planets, photoevaporation alters the final
semimajor axis of a migrating gas giant by at most 5% over the course of 0.1
Myr of migration. Once the disk mass is low enough for photoevaporation to
carve a sharp gap, migration has almost completely stalled due to the low
surface density of gas at the Lindblad resonances. We find that
photoevaporation modifies migration rates so little that it is unlikely to
leave a significant signature on the distribution of giant exoplanets.

are currently out of scientific reach. To address this problem, we propose a
novel approach that combines a probabilistic physical damage catastrophe model
with a new generation of macroeconomic agent-based models (ABMs). The ABM moves
beyond the state of the art by exploiting large data sets from detailed
national accounts, census data, and business information, etc., to simulate
interactions of millions of agents representing \emph{each} natural person or
legal entity in a national economy. The catastrophe model introduces a copula
approach to assess flood losses, considering spatial dependencies of the flood
hazard. These loss estimates are used in a damage scenario generator that
provides input for the ABM, which then estimates indirect economic losses due
to the event. For the first time, we are able to link environmental and
economic processes in a computer simulation at this level of detail. We show
that moderate disasters induce comparably small but positive short- to
medium-term, and negative long-term economic impacts. Large-scale events,
however, trigger a pronounced negative economic response immediately after the
event and in the long term, while exhibiting a temporary short- to medium-term
economic boost. We identify winners and losers in different economic sectors,
including the fiscal consequences for the government. We quantify the critical
disaster size beyond which the resilience of an economy to rebuild reaches its
limits. Our results might be relevant for the management of the consequences of
systemic events due to climate change and other disasters.

through cloud among different physicians to improve the quality of health care.
Therefore, right protection of medical records is important to protect their
ownership once they are shared with third parties. Watermarking is a proven
well known technique to achieve this objective. The challenges associated with
watermarking of EMR systems are: (1) some fields in EMR are more relevant in
the diagnosis process; as a result, small variations in them could change the
diagnosis, and (2) a misdiagnosis might not only result in a life threatening
scenario but also might lead to significant costs of the treatment for the
patients. The major contribution of this paper is an information-preserving
watermarking scheme to address the above-mentioned challenges. We model the
watermarking process as a constrained optimization problem. We demonstrate,
through experiments, that our scheme not only preserves the diagnosis accuracy
but is also resilient to well known attacks for corrupting the watermark. Last
but not least, we also compare our scheme with a well known threshold-based
scheme to evaluate relative merits of a classifier. Our pilot studies reveal
that -- using proposed information-preserving scheme -- the overall
classification accuracy is never degraded by more than 1%. In comparison, the

tomography (OCT) images of the retina. OCT images from 10 patients with mild
non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy were used from a public (U. of Miami)
dataset. For each patient, five images were available: one image of the fovea
center, two images of the perifovea, and two images of the parafovea. For each
image, two expert graders each manually annotated five retinal surfaces (i.e.
boundaries between pairs of retinal layers). The first grader's annotations
were used as ground truth and the second grader's annotations to compute
inter-operator agreement. The proposed automated approach segments images using
fully convolutional networks (FCNs) together with Gaussian process (GP)-based
regression as a post-processing step to improve the quality of the estimates.
Using 10-fold cross validation, the performance of the algorithms is determined
by computing the per-pixel unsigned error (distance) between the automated
estimates and the ground truth annotations generated by the first manual
grader. We compare the proposed method against five state of the art automatic
segmentation techniques. The results show that the proposed methods compare
favorably with state of the art techniques, resulting in the smallest mean
unsigned error values and associated standard deviations, and performance is
comparable with human annotation of retinal layers from OCT when there is only
mild retinopathy. The results suggest that semantic segmentation using FCNs,
coupled with regression-based post-processing, can effectively solve the OCT
segmentation problem on par with human capabilities with mild retinopathy.

of the resonance electroexcitation amplitudes revealed the $N^*$ structure as a

mass and the host halo mass at z~0.3 and found that the inclusion of AGN
feedbackalways leads to a much better agreement with observational values and
trends. Our analysis suggests also that the inclusion of AGN feedback favours a
strong correlation between gamma'_tot and the density slope of the dark matter

correlated with the density slope of the stellar component. Finally, we find
that gamma'_tot derived from our samples of galaxies increases from z=2 to
z=0,in good agreement with the expected observational trend. The derived slopes
are slightly lower than in the data when AGN is included because the simulated

the simulated compact galaxies without AGN feedback have gamma'_tot values that

is trapped in the focus of two laser beams and pulled apart (by moving the
laser beams) a configuration of two droplets connected by a thin tether of oil
results. The tether radius depends on the ratio of the bending modulus to the
renormalized interfacial tension, which takes into account the spontaneous
curvature of the interface. The force exerted by the tether on the droplets is
shown to be asymmetric with respect to the phase inversion temperature of the
emulsion, in agreement with experiment. Fluid can be pumped from one droplet to
the other via the tether by increasing the optical pressure on one droplet. The
flow is a combination of Poiseuille flow within the thread of oil and the
external flow around a rigid cylinder, with the surface velocity determined by
tangential stress balance. For typical viscosities of oils and the continuous
aqueous medium, flow is predominantly in the external medium. The normal stress
balance leads to a variation in the radius of the thread with distance. The
radius is shown to decrease approximately linearly with a slope proportional to
the volumetric flow rate through the tether. For a tether of a given length,
there is therefore an upper limit to the flow rate that can be generated by
pumping with optical traps.

stepping in a narrow window in configuration space is needed for generating
high power at physiologically relevant loads. By deriving general
thermodynamics laws for nonequilibrium motors, we find that the maximum torque
(force) at stall is less than its theoretical limit for any realistic

tradeoff for the motor- track interaction: while a strong interaction generates
a high power output for forward steps, it also leads to a higher probability of
wasteful spontaneous back steps. Our analysis and simulations show that this
tradeoff sets a fundamental limit to the maximum motor efficiency in the
presence of spontaneous back steps, i.e., loose-coupling. Balancing this

Moreover, in bounded domains, boundary conditions must be incorporated in these
characterizations in mathematically distinct ways, and there is currently no
consensus in the literature as to which definition of the fractional Laplacian
in bounded domains is most appropriate for a given application. The Riesz (or
integral) definition, for example, admits a nonlocal boundary condition, where
the value of a function u(x) must be prescribed on the entire exterior of the
domain in order to compute its fractional Laplacian. In contrast, the spectral
definition requires only the standard local boundary condition. These
differences, among others, lead us to ask the question: ""What is the fractional
Laplacian?"" We compare several commonly used definitions of the fractional
Laplacian (the Riesz, spectral, directional, and horizon-based nonlocal
definitions), and we use a joint theoretical and computational approach to
examining their different characteristics by studying solutions of related
fractional Poisson equations formulated on bounded domains.
  In this work, we provide new numerical methods as well as a self-contained

practitioners in identifying the most appropriate definition and computational

Simon Kochen and Ernst Specker (1960-1967) and by John Bell (1964-1966), is
certainly one of the most fundamental aspects of quantum weirdness. If it is a
questioning on scholastic philosophy and a study of contrafactual logic that
led Specker to his demonstration with Kochen, it was a criticism of von
Neumann's ""proof"" that led John Bell to the result. A misinterpretation of this
famous ""proof"" will lead them to diametrically opposite conclusions. Over the
last decades, remarkable theoretical progresses have been made on the subject
in the context of the study of quantum foundations and quantum information.
Thus, the graphic generalizations of Cabello-Severini-Winter and
Acin-Fritz-Leverrier-Sainz raise the question of the connection between
non-locality and contextuality. It is also the case of the sheaf-theoretic
approach of Samson Abramsky et al., which also invites us to compare
contextuality with the logical structure of certain classical logical
paradoxes. Another approach, initiated by Robert Spekkens, generalizes the
concept to any type of experimental procedure. This new form of ""universal""
contextuality has been raised as a criterion of non-classicality, i.e. of
weirdness. It notably led to identify the nature of curious quantum paradoxes
involving post-selections and weak measurements. In the light of the fiftieth
anniversary of the publication of the Kochen-Specker theorem, this report aims
to introduce these results little known to the French scientific public, in the
context of an investigation on the nature of the weirdness of quantum physics.

the weights, we employ psychoacoustic models to compute the global masking
threshold from the clean speech spectra. We then evaluate the speech denoising
performance of our perceptually guided neural network by using both objective
and perceptual sound quality metrics, testing on various network structures
ranging from shallow and narrow ones to deep and wide ones. The experimental
results showcase our method as a valid approach for infusing perceptual

building autonomous robots. Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes
(POMDPs) provide a standard framework for modeling uncertainty in many
applications. In this work, we study POMDPs with safe-reachability objectives,
which require that with a probability above some threshold, a goal state is
eventually reached while keeping the probability of visiting unsafe states
below some threshold. This POMDP formulation is different from the traditional
POMDP models with optimality objectives and we show that in some cases, POMDPs
with safe-reachability objectives can provide a better guarantee of both safety
and reachability than the existing POMDP models through an example. A key
algorithmic problem for POMDPs is policy synthesis, which requires reasoning
over a vast space of beliefs (probability distributions). To address this
challenge, we introduce the notion of a goal-constrained belief space, which
only contains beliefs reachable from the initial belief under desired
executions that can achieve the given safe-reachability objective. Our method
compactly represents this space over a bounded horizon using symbolic
constraints, and employs an incremental Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)
solver to efficiently search for a valid policy over it. We evaluate our method
using a case study involving a partially observable robotic domain with
uncertain obstacles. The results show that our method can synthesize policies
over large belief spaces with a small number of SMT solver calls by focusing on
the goal-constrained belief space.

suitable, hence the Poisson regression model is inappropriate. As a
generalization of the Poisson distribution, the COM-Poisson distribution can
deal with under-, equi- and overdispersed count data. It is a member of the
exponential family of distributions and has well known special cases. In spite
of the nice properties of the COM-Poisson distribution, its location parameter
does not correspond to the expectation, which complicates the interpretation of
regression models. In this paper, we propose a straightforward
reparametrization of the COM-Poisson distribution based on an approximation to
the expectation of this distribution. The main advantage of our new
parametrization is the straightforward interpretation of the regression
coefficients in terms of the expectation, as usual in the context of
generalized linear models. Furthermore, the estimation and inference for the
new COM-Poisson regression model can be done based on the likelihood paradigm.
We carried out simulation studies to verify the finite sample properties of the
maximum likelihood estimators. The results from our simulation study show that
the maximum likelihood estimators are unbiased and consistent for both
regression and dispersion parameters. We observed that the empirical
correlation between the regression and dispersion parameter estimators is close
to zero, which suggests that these parameters are orthogonal. We illustrate the
application of the proposed model through the analysis of three data sets with
over-, under- and equidispersed count data. The study of distribution
properties through a consideration of dispersion, zero-inflated and heavy tail
indexes, together with the results of data analysis show the flexibility over
standard approaches.

However, for ordered structures such as strings, images, and ordered graphs,
the characterization problem seems very difficult in general.
  In this paper, we identify a wide class of properties of ordered structures -
the earthmover resilient (ER) properties - and show that the ""good behavior"" of
such properties allows us to obtain general testability results that are
similar to (and more general than) those of unordered graphs. A property P is
ER if, roughly speaking, slight changes in the order of the elements in an

properties includes, e.g., all unordered graph properties, many natural visual
properties of images, such as convexity, and all hereditary properties of
ordered graphs and images.
  A special case of our results implies, building on a recent result of Alon

dense regions of molecular gas in the ISM, and so constraining dust properties
is key to obtaining accurate measurements of dust mass and temperature. By
placing constraints on the dust emissivity spectral index, beta, towards two
star-forming infrared dark clouds, SDC18.888 and SDC24.489, we evaluate the
role of mass concentration in the associated star-formation activity. We
exploit the simultaneous 1.2mm and 2.0mm imaging capability of NIKA on the IRAM
30m telescope to construct maps of beta for both clouds, and by incorporating
Herschel observations, we create H2 column density maps with 13"" resolution.
While we find no significant systematic radial variations around the most
massive clumps in either cloud on >0.1 pc scales, their mean beta values are
significantly different, with beta = 2.07 +/- 0.09 (rand) +/- 0.25 (syst) for
SDC18.888 and beta = 1.71 +/- 0.09 (rand) +/- 0.25 (syst) for SDC24.489. These
differences could be a consequence of the very different environments in which
both clouds lie, and we suggest that the proximity of SDC18.888 to the W39 HII
region may raise beta on scales of 1 pc. We also find that the mass in
SDC24.489 is more centrally concentrated and circularly symmetric than in
SDC18.888, and is consistent with a scenario in which spherical
globally-collapsing clouds concentrate a higher fraction of their mass into a
single core than elongated clouds that will more easily fragment, distributing
their mass into many cores. We demonstrate that beta variations towards
interstellar clouds can be robustly constrained with high-SNR NIKA
observations, providing more accurate estimates of their masses. The methods
presented here will be applied to the Galactic Star Formation with NIKA2
(GASTON) large programme, extending our analysis to a statistically significant
sample of star-forming clouds.

fire phenomena to those who regularly encounter them: firefighters.
Firefighters' safety and lives often depend on their ability to predict
flashovers before they occur. Typical pre-flashover fire characteristics
include dark smoke, high heat, and rollover (""angel fingers"") and can be
quantified by color, size, and shape. Using a color video stream from a
firefighter's body camera, we applied generative adversarial neural networks
for image enhancement. The neural networks were trained to enhance very dark
fire and smoke patterns in videos and monitor dynamic changes in smoke and fire
areas. Preliminary tests with limited flashover training videos showed that we
predicted a flashover as early as 55 seconds before it occurred.

Riemannian ($R$) and a Lorentzian ($L$) domain. The geodesic flow does not have
singularities over $R$ and $L$, and for any point $q \in R \cup L$ and every

on ad hoc choices of what variables are included. In addition, uncertainty from
the iterative process of model selection is complicated and often ignored in
subsequent inference about treatment effects. We develop new methods and theory
to obtain not only doubly robust point estimators for average treatment
effects, which remain consistent if either the propensity score model or the
outcome regression model is correctly specified, but also model-assisted
confidence intervals, which are valid when the propensity score model is
correctly specified but the outcome regression model may be misspecified. With
a linear outcome model, the confidence intervals are doubly robust, that is,
being also valid when the outcome model is correctly specified but the
propensity score model may be misspecified. Our methods involve regularized
calibrated estimators with Lasso penalties, but carefully chosen loss
functions, for fitting propensity score and outcome regression models. We
provide high-dimensional analysis to establish the desired properties of our
methods under comparable conditions to previous results, which give valid
confidence intervals when both the propensity score and outcome regression are

for queueing models relevant to several applications. While there exists
considerable theory on the properties of projective cone schedulers, there is
little practical guidance on choosing the parameters that define them. In this
paper, we propose an algorithm for designing an automated projective cone
scheduling system based on observations of an expert projective cone scheduler.
We show that the estimated scheduling policy is able to emulate the expert in
the sense that the average loss realized by the learned policy will converge to
zero. Specifically, for a system with $n$ queues observed over a time horizon
$T$, the average loss for the algorithm is $O(\ln(T)\sqrt{\ln(n)/T})$. This
upper bound holds regardless of the statistical characteristics of the system.
The algorithm uses the multiplicative weights update method and can be applied
online so that additional observations of the expert scheduler can be used to
improve an existing estimate of the policy. This provides a data-driven method
for designing a scheduling policy based on observations of a human expert. We
demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm with a simple numerical example and
discuss several extensions.

results for better classification. Unlike previous methods that link objects by
checking boxes between neighboring frames, we propose to link in the same

a cuboid proposal network that extracts spatio-temporal candidate cuboids which
bound the movement of objects; (2) a short tubelet detection network that
detects short tubelets in short video segments; (3) a short tubelet linking
algorithm that links temporally-overlapping short tubelets to form long

spin. In addition, in order to get the insight into the rotational-like
properties of nuclei, theoretical calculations have been performed for the
yrast bands of the odd-A rare-earth nuclei using the total Routhian surfaces
(TRS) model. The TRS plots indicate that the 165Yb and 157Dy isotopes have
stable prolate shapes at low spin states. At higher rotational frequency
(larger than 0.50 MeV), a distinct decrease in the quadrupole deformation is
predicted by the calculations, and the isotopes becomes rigid in the gamma
deformation.

  approach","17 pages, 3 figures",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In (Jin, 2018), a new day-to-day dynamical system was proposed for drivers'
departure time choice at a single bottleneck. Based on three behavioral
principles, the nonlocal departure and arrival times choice problems were
converted to the local scheduling payoff choice problem, whose day-to-day
dynamics are described by the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model on an
imaginary road of increasing scheduling payoff. Thus the departure time user
equilibrium (DTUE), the arrival time user equilibrium (ATUE), and the
scheduling payoff user equilibrium (SPUE) are uniquely determined by the
stationary state of the LWR model, which was shown to be locally,
asymptotically stable with analysis of the discrete approximation of the LWR
model and through a numerical example. In this study attempt to analytically
prove the global stability of the SPUE, ATUE, and DTUE. We first generalize the
conceptual models for arrival time and scheduling payoff choices developed in
(Jin, 2018) for a single bottleneck with a generalized scheduling cost
function, which includes the cost of the free-flow travel time. Then we present
the LWR model for the day-to-day dynamics for the scheduling payoff choice as
well as the SPUE. We further formulate a new optimization problem for the SPUE
and demonstrate its equivalent to the optimization problem for the ATUE in
(Iryo and Yoshii, 2007). Finally we show that the objective functions in the
two optimization formulations are equal and can be used as the potential
function for the LWR model and prove that the stationary state of the LWR
model, and therefore, the SPUE, DTUE, and ATUE, are globally, asymptotically
stable, by using Lyapunov's second method. Such a globally stable behavioral
model can provide more efficient departure time and route choice guidance for
human drivers and connected and autonomous vehicles in more complicated
networks.

  Estimation in Systems Biology",,,,,"q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Models of biological systems often have many unknown parameters that must be
determined in order for model behavior to match experimental observations.
Commonly-used methods for parameter estimation that return point estimates of
the best-fit parameters are insufficient when models are high dimensional and
under-constrained. As a result, Bayesian methods, which treat model parameters
as random variables and attempt to estimate their probability distributions
given data, have become popular in systems biology. Bayesian parameter
estimation often relies on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to sample
model parameter distributions, but the slow convergence of MCMC sampling can be
a major bottleneck. One approach to improving performance is parallel tempering
(PT), a physics-based method that uses swapping between multiple Markov chains
run in parallel at different temperatures to accelerate sampling. The
temperature of a Markov chain determines the probability of accepting an
unfavorable move, so swapping with higher temperatures chains enables the
sampling chain to escape from local minima. In this work we compared the MCMC
performance of PT and the commonly-used Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm on
six biological models of varying complexity. We found that for simpler models
PT accelerated convergence and sampling, and that for more complex models, PT
often converged in cases MH became trapped in non-optimal local minima. We also
developed a freely-available MATLAB package for Bayesian parameter estimation
called PTempEst (http://github.com/RuleWorld/ptempest), which is closely
integrated with the popular BioNetGen software for rule-based modeling of

flexibility of this framework lies in the freedom to choose the classifier and

onset of instabilities in lattice structures. The study is motivated by
previous observations on discrete hexagonal lattices, where the onset of
non-uniform, quasi-static deformation patterns was associated with the loss of
convexity of the interaction potential, and where a variety of localized
deformations were found depending on loading configuration, lattice parameters
and boundary conditions. These observations are here conducted on other lattice
structures, with the goal of identifying models of reduced complexity that are
able to provide insight into the key parameters that govern the onset of
instability-induced localization. To this end, we first consider a
two-dimensional square lattice consisting of point masses connected by in-plane
axial springs and vertical ground springs. Results illustrate that depending on
the choice of spring constants and their relative values, the lattice exhibits
in-plane or out-of plane instabilities leading to folding and unfolding. This
model is further simplified by considering the one-dimensional case of a
spring-mass chain sitting on an elastic foundation. A bifurcation analysis of
this lattice identifies the stable and unstable branches and illustrates its
hysteretic and loading path-dependent behaviors. Finally, the lattice is
further reduced to a minimal four mass model which undergoes a
folding/unfolding process qualitatively similar to the same process in the
central part of a longer chain, helping our understanding of localization in
more complex systems. In contrast to the widespread assumption that
localization is induced by defects or imperfections in a structure, this work
illustrates that such phenomena can arise in perfect lattices as a consequence
of the mode-shapes at the bifurcation points.

effectively quench the star formation in their host galaxies. To test feedback
models based on AGN outflows, it is mandatory to investigate UFOs near the peak
of AGN activity, that is, at high-z where only a few studies are available to
date.
  UFOs produce Fe resonant absorption lines measured above $\approx$7 keV. The
most critical problem in detecting such features in distant objects is the
difficulty in obtaining X-ray data with sufficient signal-to-noise. We
therefore selected a distant QSO that gravitational lensing made bright enough
for these purposes, the z=2.64 QSO MG J0414+0534, and observed it with
XMM-Newton for $\approx$78 ks.}
  The X-ray spectrum of MG J0414+0534 is complex and shows signatures of cold
absorption (N$_{H}\approx$4$\times$10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) and of the presence of
an iron emission line (E$\approx$6.4 keV, EW$=$95$\pm$53 eV) consistent with it
originating in the cold absorber. Our main result, however, is the robust
detection (more than 5$\sigma$) of an absorption line at E$_{int}\approx$9.2
keV (E$_{obs}\approx$2.5 keV observer frame). If interpreted as due to FeXXVI,
it implies gas outflowing at $v_{out}\approx$0.3c. To our knowledge, this is
the first detection of an UFO in a radio-loud quasar at z$\geq$1.5. We
estimated that the UFO mechanical output is
$\dot{E}_{kin}$$\approx$2.5$L_{bol}$ with
$\dot{p}_{out}/\dot{p}_{rad}\approx$17 indicating that it is capable of
installing significant feedback between the super-massive black hole (SMBH) and
the bulge of the host galaxy. We argue that this also suggests a magnetic
driving origin of the UFO.

is established to extend the result to a partial integro-differential equation
with singular convolution kernel, which is a generalized form of the stationary

distort the typically spherical stellar surface. These distortions, known as
ellipsoidal variations, result in changes in the photometric flux emitted by
the star, which can be detected within the data from the Kepler Space
Telescope. Currently, there exist several models describing such variations and
their effect on the photometric flux. By using Bayesian model testing in
conjunction with the Bayesian-based exoplanet characterization software package
EXONEST, the most probable representation for ellipsoidal variations was
determined for synthetic data and the confirmed hot Jupiter exoplanet
Kepler-13Ab.The most preferred model for ellipsoidal variations observed in the
Kepler-13 light curve was determined to be EVIL-MC. Among the trigonometric
models, the Modified Kane & Gelino model provided the best representation of
ellipsoidal variations for the Kepler-13 system and may serve as a fast
alternative to the more computationally intensive EVIL-MC. The computational
feasibility of directly modeling the ellipsoidal variations of a star are
examined and future work is outlined. Providing a more accurate model of
ellipsoidal variations is expected to result in better planetary mass

the first rational, metacognitive account of the Availability bias, formally
articulated at Marr's algorithmic level of analysis. Concretely, we present a
normative, metacognitive model of how a cognitive system should over-represent
extreme eventualities, depending on the amount of time available at its

framing effects in human decision-making under risk---the fourfold pattern of
risk preferences in outcome probability (Tversky & Kahneman, 1992) and in
outcome magnitude (Markovitz, 1952)---thereby providing the first

furthermore, confirms an important prediction of our model. Surprisingly, our

the implications of our work for studies on human decision-making, and conclude
by presenting a counterintuitive prediction of our model, which, if confirmed,
would have intriguing implications for human decision-making under risk. To our

The third operator couple the photon and $Z^0$ fields to the higher multipoles
of dark matter, yielding a \textit{spin portal} to dark matter. For dark matter
($D$) mass below a half of the $Z^0$ mass, the decays $Z^0\to \bar{D} D$ and
$H\to \bar{D}D$ are kinematically allowed and contribute to the invisible
widths of the $Z^0$ and $H$. We calculate these decays and use experimental
results on these invisible widths to constrain the values of the low energy
constants finding in general that effects of the spin portal can be more
important that those of the Higgs portal. We calculate the dark matter relic

matter particles into the range allowed by cosmology. The efficiency of this
process is enhanced by stop-antistop annihilations into the longitudinal
(Goldstone) modes of the $W$ and $Z$ bosons, as well as by Sommerfeld
enhancement of stop annihilations and the effects of bound states. Since the
couplings of the stops to the Goldstone modes are proportional to the trilinear
soft supersymmetry-breaking $A$-terms, these annihilations are enhanced when
the $A$-terms are large. However, the Higgs mass may be reduced below the
measured value if the $A$-terms are too large. Unfortunately, the
interpretation of this constraint on the stop coannihilation strip is clouded
by differences between the available Higgs mass calculators. For our study, we
use as our default calculator FeynHiggs 2.13.0, the most recent publicly
available version of this code. Exploring the CMSSM parameter space, we find
that along the stop coannihilation strip the masses of the stops are severely
split by the large $A$-terms. This suppresses the Higgs mass drastically for
$\mu$ and $A_0 > 0$, whilst the extent of the stop coannihilation strip is
limited for $A_0 < 0$ and either sign of $\mu$. However, in sub-GUT models,
reduced renormalization-group running mitigates the effect of the large
$A$-terms, allowing larger LSP masses to be consistent with the Higgs mass
calculation. We give examples where the dark matter particle mass may reach

inferences that synthesizes the local patterns and the rule-modulated map. To
solve the optimization problem caused by rules, we use a two-stage optimization
strategy to train the ReNN model. By introducing rules into ReNN, we can
strengthen traditional neural networks with long-term dependencies which are
difficult to learn with limited empirical dataset, thus improving inference
accuracy. The complexity of neural networks can be reduced since long-term
dependencies are not modeled with neural connections, and thus the amount of
data needed to optimize the neural networks can be reduced. Besides, inferences
from ReNN can be analyzed with both local patterns and rules, and thus have
better interpretability. In this paper, ReNN has been validated with a

multiferroicity. One reason is that the spiral spin order is highly sensitive
to the oxygen concentration in MnCr2O4. Here, we have successfully grown
high-quality single-crystalline MnCr2O4 by the chemical vapor transport method.
We observe a new first-order magnetic transition from the incommensurate spiral

verified by magnetization, specific heat, and magnetoelectric measurements,
which also confirm that the ground state exhibits the coexistence of the CSSO

We introduce and benchmark different methods based on self-consistent solutions
of non-equilibrium Green's functions and numerical simulations of the quantum
master equation, and derive both analytical and numerical results. It is shown
that in the dissipative regime where the cavity photon decay rate is the
largest parameter, the light-matter coupling is responsible for a steady-state
current enhancement scaling with the cooperativity parameter. We further
identify different regimes of interest depending on the ratio between the
cavity decay rate and the electronic bandwidth. Considering the situation where
the lower band has a vanishing bandwidth, we show that for a high-finesse
cavity, the properties of the resonant Bloch state in the upper band are
transfered to the lower one, giving rise to a delocalized state along the
chain. Conversely, in the dissipative regime with low cavity quality factors,
we find that the current enhancement is due to a collective decay of
populations from the upper to the lower band.

assumed throughout. An approach, based purely on ""thermodynamic"" observables,
e.g., chemical potential, excess density due to the droplet, etc., is used, to
avoid ambiguities in the decision which particles belong (or do not belong,
respectively) to the droplet. It is found that the results are compatible with
a variation $[\Theta(R)-\Theta_{\infty}] \propto 1/R$, $\Theta_{\infty}$ being
the contact angle in the thermodynamic limit ($R=\infty$). The possibility to
use such results to estimate the excess free energy related to the contact line
of the droplet, namely the line tension, at the wall, is discussed. Various
problems that hamper this approach and were not fully recognized in previous
attempts to extract the line tension are identified. It is also found that the
dependence of wall tensions on the difference of chemical potential of the
droplet from that at the bulk coexistence provides effectively a change of the
contact angle of similar magnitude. The simulation approach yields precise
estimates for the excess density due to wall-attached droplets and the

for elliptical random vectors. In a previous paper, we proposed a methodology
to approximate extreme quantiles, based on two extremal parameters. We thus
propose some estimators for these parameters, and study their asymptotic
properties in the case of heavy-tailed distributions. Thereafter, from these
parameters, we construct extreme conditional quantiles estimators, and give
their consistency properties. Using recent results on the asymptotic
relationship between quantiles and other risk measures, we deduce estimators
for extreme conditional Lp-quantiles and Haezendonck-Goovaerts risk measures.
In order to test the efficiency of our estimators, we propose a simulation
study. A financial data example is also proposed.

evaporating sessile binary droplet, consisting of a mixture of water and a

(KBQA) because of the high variance of relation expression in the question.
Traditional deep learning methods follow an encoding-comparing paradigm, where
the question and the candidate relation are represented as vectors to compare
their semantic similarity. Max- or average- pooling operation, which compresses
the sequence of words into fixed-dimensional vectors, becomes the bottleneck of
information. In this paper, we propose to learn attention-based word-level
interactions between questions and relations to alleviate the bottleneck issue.
Similar to the traditional models, the question and relation are firstly
represented as sequences of vectors. Then, instead of merging the sequence into
a single vector with pooling operation, soft alignments between words from the
question and the relation are learned. The aligned words are subsequently
compared with the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the comparison results
are merged finally. Through performing the comparison on low-level
representations, the attention-based word-level interaction model (ABWIM)
relieves the information loss issue caused by merging the sequence into a
fixed-dimensional vector before the comparison. The experimental results of
relation detection on both SimpleQuestions and WebQuestions datasets show that
ABWIM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness.

recordings from two previous studies, both from stationary situations, and
their resulting perceptual data as input to our analysis. An initial analysis
was on the room acoustics of the recordings. The parameters of interest were
sound pressure level, autocorrelation and spectral centroid. The auditory
models were used to analyze echolocation resulting from the perceptual
variables, i.e. loudness, pitch and sharpness. Relevant auditory models were
chosen to simulate each variable. Based on these results, we calculated
psychophysical thresholds for detecting a reflecting object with constant
physical size. A non-parametric method was used to determine thresholds for
distance, loudness, pitch and sharpness. Difference thresholds were calculated
for the psychophysical variables, since a 2-Alternative-Forced-Choice Paradigm
had originally been used. We found that (1) blind persons could detect objects
at lower loudness values, lower pitch strength, different sharpness values and
at further distances than sighted persons, (2) detection thresholds based on
repetition pitch, loudness and sharpness varied and depended on room acoustics
and type of sound stimuli, (3) repetition pitch was useful for detection at
shorter distances and was determined from the peaks in the temporal profile of
the autocorrelation function, (4) loudness at shorter distances provides
echolocation information, (5) at longer distances, timbre aspects, such as
sharpness, might be used to detect objects. We also discuss binaural
information, movements and the auditory model approach. Autocorrelation was
assumed as a proper measure for pitch, but the question is raised whether a
mechanism based on strobe integration is a viable possibility.

methods based on network analyses and opinion dynamics to described how
individuals influence each other during a group discussion. We consider the
situation in which a small group of three individuals engages in a discussion
to solve an estimation task. We propose a model describing how group members
gradually influence each other and revise their judgments over the course of
the discussion. The main component of the model is an influence network - a
weighted, directed graph that determines the extent to which individuals
influence each other during the discussion. In simulations, we first study the
optimal structure of the influence network that yields the best group
performances. Then, we implement a social learning process by which individuals
adapt to the past performance of their peers, thereby affecting the structure
of the influence network in the long run. We explore the mechanisms underlying
the emergence of efficient or maladaptive networks and show that the influence
network can converge towards the optimal one, but only when individuals exhibit
a social discounting bias by downgrading the relative performances of their
peers. Finally, we find a late-speaker effect, whereby individuals who speak
later in the discussion are perceived more positively in the long run and are
thus more influential. The numerous predictions of the model can serve as a

Center with alternative theories of gravity and in this case one can constrain
parameters of such theories with observational data for the Galactic Center. In
particular, theories of massive gravity are intensively developing and
theorists have overcome pathologies presented in initial versions of these
theories. In theories of massive gravity, a graviton is massive in contrast
with GR where a graviton is massless. Now these theories are considered as an
alternative to GR. For example, the LIGO-Virgo collaboration obtained the
graviton mass constraint of about $1.2 \times 10^{-22}$ eV in their first
publication about the discovery of the first gravitational wave detection event
that resulted of the merger of two massive black holes. Surprisingly, one could
obtain a consistent and comparable constraint of graviton mass at a level
around $m_{g} < 2.9 \times 10^{-21}$ eV from analysis of observational data on
the trajectory of the star S2 near the Galactic Center. Therefore, observations
of bright stars with existing and forthcoming telescopes such as the European
Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) and the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) are
extremely useful for investigating the structure of the Galactic Center in the

Although we use block codes with hard decoding to specify the models our
modeling principles are applicable to all forward error correction codes as

neural network (AG-CNN). AG-CNN 1) learns from disease-specific regions to
avoid noise and improve alignment, 2) also integrates a global branch to
compensate the lost discriminative cues by local branch. Specifically, we first
learn a global CNN branch using global images. Then, guided by the attention
heat map generated from the global branch, we inference a mask to crop a
discriminative region from the global image. The local region is used for
training a local CNN branch. Lastly, we concatenate the last pooling layers of
both the global and local branches for fine-tuning the fusion branch. The
Comprehensive experiment is conducted on the ChestX-ray14 dataset. We first
report a strong global baseline producing an average AUC of 0.841 with
ResNet-50 as backbone. After combining the local cues with the global
information, AG-CNN improves the average AUC to 0.868. While DenseNet-121 is
used, the average AUC achieves 0.871, which is a new state of the art in the
community.

alternative to the classical search routines, that exploited the large set of
archival observations of Terzan 5 acquired with the Green Bank Telescope over 5
years (from 2010 to 2015). This technique allowed the analysis of stacked power
spectra obtained by combining ~206 hours of observation. J1748-2446aj has a
spin period of ~2.96 ms, J1748-2446ak of ~1.89 ms (thus it is the fourth
fastest pulsar in the cluster) and J1748-2446al of ~5.95 ms. All the three
millisecond pulsars are isolated and currently we have timing solutions only
for J1748-2446aj and J1748-2446ak. For these two systems, we evaluated the
contribution to the measured spin-down rate of the acceleration due to the
cluster potential field, thus estimating the intrinsic spin-down rates, which
are in agreement with those typically measured for millisecond pulsars in
globular clusters. Our results increase to 37 the number of pulsars known in
Terzan 5, which now hosts 25% of the entire pulsar population identified, so
far, in globular clusters.

electro-magnetic field strengths. The classical $\hbar$-independent Maxwell's
equations naturally emerge from this fundamental quantum-mechanical approach in
terms of expectation values of quantum fields, and are therefore also
consistent with the special theory of relativity. The fundamental difference
between interference phenomena due to the linear nature of the classical
Maxwell theory as, e.g., in classical optics, and interference effects of
quantum states is clarified. The framework outlined also provides for a simple
approach to, e.g., spontaneous photon emission and/or absorption processes as
well as to the classical Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation. The inherent and
necessary quantum fluctuations, limiting a precise space-time knowledge of
expectation values of the quantum fields considered, are, finally, recalled.

freedom present in the early Universe, it is more realistic to view these
fluctuations as an open quantum system interacting with an environment. Then,
on very general grounds, their evolution can be modelled with a Lindblad
equation. This modified evolution leads to quantum decoherence of the system,
as well as to corrections to observables such as the power spectrum of
curvature fluctuations. On one hand, current cosmological observations
constrain the properties of possible environments and place upper bounds on the
interaction strengths. On the other hand, imposing that decoherence completes
by the end of inflation implies lower bounds on the interaction strengths.
Therefore, the question arises of whether successful decoherence can occur
without altering the power spectrum. In this paper, we systematically identify
all scenarios in which this is possible. As an illustration, we discuss the
case in which the environment consists of a heavy test scalar field. We show
that this realises the very peculiar configuration where the correction to the
power spectrum is quasi scale invariant. In that case, the presence of the
environment improves the fit to the data for some inflationary models but
deteriorates it for others. This clearly demonstrates that decoherence is not
only of theoretical importance but can also be crucial for astrophysical
observations.

formation rates (SFRs) on scales from small Milky Way clouds to whole galaxies.
The observed correlation offers strong constraints on the efficiency of star
formation in dense gas, but quantitative interpretation of this constraint
requires a mapping from HCN emission to gas mass and density. In this paper we
provide the required calibration by postprocessing high-resolution simulations
of dense, star-forming clouds to calculate their HCN emission ($L_{\rm HCN}$)
and to determine how that emission is related to the underlying gas density
distribution and star formation efficiency. We find that HCN emission traces
gas with a luminosity-weighted mean number density of $0.8-1.7 \times
10^4\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$ and that HCN luminosity is related to mass of dense gas of
$\gtrsim 10^4\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$ with a conversion factor of ${\alpha}_{\rm HCN}
\approx 14\,\rm M_{\odot}/(K\,km\,s^{-1}\,{pc}^2)$. We also measure a new
empirical relationship between the SFR per global mean freefall time
(${\epsilon}_{\rm ff}$) and the SFR$-$HCN relationship, ${\rm SFR}/L_{\rm HCN}
= 2.0 \times 10^{-7}\,({\epsilon}_{\rm ff}/0.01)^{1.1}\,\rm
M_{\odot}\,{yr}^{-1}/(K\,km\,s^{-1}\,{pc}^2)$. The observed SFR$-$HCN
correlation strongly constrains ${\epsilon}_{\rm ff} \approx 1\%$ with a factor
of $\sim 3$ systematic uncertainty. The scatter in ${\epsilon}_{\rm ff}$ from
cloud to cloud within the Milky Way is a factor of a few. We conclude that
$L_{\rm HCN}$ is an effective tracer of dense gas and that the IR$-$HCN
correlation is a significant diagnostic of the microphysics of star formation
in dense gas.

COBRA, an active method that first over-clusters the data by running K-means

resulting small clusters into larger ones based on pairwise constraints. In its
merging step, COBRA is able to keep the number of pairwise queries low by
maximally exploiting constraint transitivity and entailment. We experimentally

MultiDark-Planck Simulations, we identify primary MST stems composed of
multiple nodes as the filaments and measure their specific sizes (spatial
extents per node), which quantify the orientation coherence of the tidal field
on the cluster scales. Classifying the cluster halos into five samples by the
specific sizes of their host filaments and tallying the mass distributions of
the five samples, we investigate if and how the substructure abundance of the
cluster halos differs among the five samples. It is found that the cluster
halos embedded in the filaments with larger specific sizes tend to possess less
substructures. This anti-correlation is also shown robust against narrowing
down the formation epochs of the cluster halos as well as against fixing the
node number of the filaments. Given that the filaments with larger specific
sizes form at the regions where the surrounding tidal fields are coherent over
large scales in the orientations of their principal axes, we suggest that in
the filaments with larger specific sizes the satellite infall and matter
accretion onto the cluster halos should be obstructed due to the development of
the tangential velocities in the plane perpendicular to the elongated axes of
the filaments.

points on the edge of text line and then utilizes these points to sketch the
outlines of the text. The proposed SLPR can be adapted to many object detection
architectures such as Faster R-CNN and R-FCN. Specifically, we first generate
the smallest rectangular box including the text with region proposal network
(RPN), then isometrically regress the points on the edge of text by using the
vertically and horizontally sliding lines. To make full use of information and
reduce redundancy, we calculate x-coordinate or y-coordinate of target point by
the rectangular box position, and just regress the remaining y-coordinate or
x-coordinate. Accordingly we can not only reduce the parameters of system, but
also restrain the points which will generate more regular polygon. Our approach

demonstrating that gravitational-waves offer the ability to probe how matter
behaves in one of the most extreme environments in the Universe. However, the
gravitational-wave signal emitted by an inspiraling binary neutron star system
is only weakly dependent on the equation of state and extracting this
information is challenging. Previous studies have focused mainly on binary
systems where the neutron stars are spinning slowly and the main imprint of
neutron star matter in the inspiral signal is due to tidal effects. For
binaries with non-negligible neutron-star spin the deformation of the neutron
star due to its own rotation introduces additional variations in the emitted
gravitational-wave signal. Here we explore whether highly spinning binary
neutron-star systems offer a better chance to measure the equation-of-state
than weakly spinning binary-neutron star systems. We focus on the dominant
adiabatic quadrupolar effects and consider three main questions. First, we show
that equation-of-state effects can be significant in the inspiral waveforms,
and that the spin-quadrupole effect dominates for rapidly rotating neutron
stars. Second, we show that variations in the spin-quadrupole phasing are
strongly degenerate with changes in the component masses and spins, and
neglecting these terms has a negligible impact on the number of observations
with second generation observatories. Finally, we explore the bias in the
masses and spins that would be introduced by using incorrect equation-of-state
terms. Using a novel method to rapidly evaluate an approximation of the
likelihood we show that assuming the incorrect equation-of-state when measuring
source parameters can lead to a significant bias. We also find that the ability
to measure the equation-of-state is improved when considering spinning systems.

mathematical structure, such systems may display quite interesting behaviours.
In particular, while for $m=2$ no coexistence of the two species is usually
possible, if $m \ge 3$ we may observe coexistence of all or a subset of the
species, sensitively depending on the parameter values. Such coexistence can
take the form of very complex spatio-temporal patterns and oscillations.
  Unfortunately, at the moment there are no known tools for a complete
analytical study of such systems for $m \ge 3$. This means that establishing
general criteria for the occurrence of coexistence appears to be very hard. In
this paper we will instead give some criteria for the non-coexistence of

an exotic species. We will show that when the environment is very favourable to
the invading species the invasion will always be successful and the native
species will be driven to extinction. On the other hand, if the environment is
not favourable enough, the invasion will always fail.

severe plastic deformation using room temperature high-pressure torsion (HPT).
A lamellar microstructure developed in each of the composites at equivalent
strains of ~75. The refractory metals developed {hkl}<111> fibre textures with
a slight tilt to the tangential direction. This texture was stronger and more
clearly defined in Mo and W than in Cr. By applying additional HPT deformation
to these samples, perpendicular to the original shear strain, it was found that
the lamellar structure of Cu30Mo70 and Cu20W80 (wt.%) composites could be
retained at high equivalent strains and the refractory layer thickness could be
reduced to 20-50 nm in Cu20W80 and 10-20 nm in Cu30Mo70. Although neighbouring
regions of the microstucture were aligned and there was evidence of local
texture in both composites, the bulk texture of Cu30Mo70 became weaker during
this second step of HPT deformation. This was attributed to the refractory
metal lamellae being discontinuous and imperfectly aligned. This work shows
that it is possible to form ultrafine composites of Cu-group VI refractory
metals via high-pressure torsion, with namolamellar structures being possible
where there is a sufficient volume fraction of Mo or W.

fission fragments (LLFPs) is crucial for nuclear transmutation studies.
However, the particle and heavy ion transport code system (PHITS) severely
overshoots the inclusive one-nucleon knockout cross sections sigma_-1N.
Therefore development of a reaction model for describing the inclusive
one-nucleon knockout processes is necessary. A key is specification of the
position and the momentum of a nucleon inside a nucleus to be struck by the
incident nucleon. In this paper the semiclassical distorted wave model
incorporating the Wigner transform of the one-body nuclear density matrix is
applied to the calculation of excitation energy distributions of reaction
residues. Decay of a residue is described by introducing a threshold parameter
for the minimum excitation energy of it. With reasonable values of the
parameter, the measured sigma_-1N for several LLFPs are reproduced by the
proposed reaction model. The incident energy dependence of sigma_-1N is found
to be governed by that of the nucleon-nucleon cross sections at energies higher
than about 75 MeV. At low energies, the nuclear absorption and the Coulomb
penetrability also become important. The energy dependence of neutron-induced
sigma_-1N is predicted and found to be quite different from that of proton
induced one. The proposed reaction model is shown to be promising in discussing
the energy dependence of nucleon-induced inclusive one-nucleon knockout
processes. The energy dependence of the measured sigma_-1p for 107Pd above 100
MeV is, however, not explained by the present calculation.

strategy. Many problems have been encountered until now, such as instability of
the closed loop system, excessive consumption in the attitude propellant or
problems for engine re-ignition in upper stages. Mostly, they have been
addressed in a passive way via the design of baffles and membranes, which on
their own have mass and constructive impacts. Active management of propellant
motion in launchers and satellites has the potential to increase performance on
various levels. This paper demonstrates active slosh management using force
feedback for the compensation of the slosh resonances. Force sensors between
tank and the carrying structure provide information of the fluid motion via the
reaction force. The control system is designed to generate an appropriate
acceleration profile that leads to desired attenuation profiles in amplitude,
frequency and time. Two robust control design methods, one based on $\mu$
design and the other on parametric structured design based on non-smooth
optimization of the worst-case $H_{\infty}$ norm, are applied. The controller
is first tested with a computational fluid dynamics simulation in the loop.
Finally a water tank mounted on a Hexapod with up to $1100$ liter is used to
evaluate the control performance. The paper illustrates that is possible to
actively influence sloshing via closed loop.

the computation time and space usage of a Turing machine program down by an
aribtrary positive factor under relatively mild side conditions by expanding
the working alphabet does not hold for OTMs.
  (3) We show that, for $\alpha<\beta$ such that $\alpha$ is the halting time

fact that coverage tasks tend to spread the agents as much as possible, which
is addressed by restricting their motions so that they keep the links of a

brightness: EXors/FUors variations are commonly associated with enhanced
accretion outbursts occurring at intermittent cadence of months/years (EXors)
and decades/centuries (FUors). Variations that can be ascribed to a variable
extinction along their line of sight are instead classified as UXors. We aim at
investigating the long-term photometric behaviour of three sources classified
as eruptive variables. We present data from the archival plates of the Asiago
Observatory relative to the fields where the targets are located. For the sake
of completeness we have also analysed the Harvard plates of the same regions
that cover a much longer historical period, albeit at a lower sensitivity,
however we are only able to provide upper limits. A total of 273 Asiago plates
were investigated, providing a total of more than 200 magnitudes for the three
stars, which cover a period of about 34 yr between 1958 and 1991. We have
compared our data with more recently collected literature data. Our plates
analysis of V2492 Cyg provides historical upper limits that seem not to be
compatible with the level of the activity monitored during the last decade.
Therefore, recently observed accretion phenomena could be associated with the
outbursting episodes, more than repetitive obscuration. While a pure extinction
does not seem the only mechanism responsible for the ASASSN-15qi fluctuations,
it can account quite reasonably for the recent V350 Cep variations.

of plans that solve many instances at once. In the standard formulation, a
generalized plan is a mapping from feature or observation histories into
actions, assuming that the instances share a common pool of features and

domains where actions and objects change across instances. In this work, we
extend the standard formulation of generalized planning to such domains. This
is achieved by projecting the actions over the features, resulting in a common
set of abstract actions which can be tested for soundness and completeness, and
which can be used for generating general policies such as ""if the gripper is
empty, pick the clear block above x and place it on the table"" that achieve the
goal clear(x) in any Blocksworld instance. In this policy, ""pick the clear
block above x"" is an abstract action that may represent the action Unstack(a,

  figure",,,,"astro-ph.CO hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The asymmetry between matter and antimatter is key to the existence and
nature of our Universe. A measure of the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the
Universe is provided by the present value of the universal ratio of baryons
(baryons minus antibaryons) to photons (or the ratio of baryons to entropy).
The baryon asymmetry parameter is an important physical and cosmological
parameter. But how fine tuned is it? A ""natural"" value for this parameter is
zero, corresponding to equal amounts of matter and antimatter. Another, also
possibly natural, choice for this dimensionless parameter would be of order
unity, corresponding to nearly equal amounts (by number) of matter (and
essentially no antimatter) and photons in every comoving volume. However,
observations suggest that in the Universe we inhabit the value of this
parameter is nonzero, but smaller than this natural value by some nine to ten
orders of magnitude. In this contribution we review the evidence that our
Universe does not contain equal amounts of matter and antimatter. Any change in
the magnitude of the baryon asymmetry parameter necessarily leads to a universe
with physical characteristics different from those in our own. The degree of
fine tuning in the baryon asymmetry parameter is determined by the width of the
range over which it can be varied and still allow for the existence of life.
Our results suggest that the baryon asymmetry parameter can be varied over a
very wide range without impacting the prospects for life; this result is not
suggestive of fine tuning. [abridged]

acceleration of relativistic particles. Two possibilities are commonly
considered for the dissipation processes, magnetic reconnection -- possibly
triggered by instabilities in magnetically-dominated jets -- , or shocks -- for
weakly magnetized flows. We consider the polarimetric features expected for the
two scenarios analyzing the results of state-of-the-art simulations. For the
magnetic reconnection scenario we conclude, using results from global
relativistic MHD simulations, that the emission likely occurs in turbulent
regions with unstructured magnetic fields, although the simulations do not
allow us to draw firm conclusions. On the other hand, with local
particle-in-cell simulations we show that, for shocks with a magnetic field
geometry suitable for particle acceleration, the self-generated magnetic field
at the shock front is predominantly orthogonal to the shock normal and becomes
quasi-parallel downstream. Based on this result we develop a simplified model
to calculate the frequency-dependent degree of polarization, assuming that
high-energy particles are injected at the shock and cool downstream. We apply
our results to HBLs, blazars with the maximum of their synchrotron output at
UV-soft X-ray energies. While in the optical band the predicted degree of
polarization is low, in the X-ray emission it can ideally reach 50\%,
especially during active/flaring states. The comparison between measurements in
the optical and in the X-ray band made during active states (feasible with the
planned {\it IXPE} satellite) are expected to provide valuable constraints on
the dissipation and acceleration processes.

also point out that an absolute upper bound on $f$ can be obtained by imposing
partial wave unitarity constraint, which in turn leads to absolute upper bounds
of $m_T\lesssim 19\,\text{TeV}, m_\eta\lesssim 1.5\,\text{TeV}$ and
$m_{Z'}\lesssim 48\,\text{TeV}$. We present the allowed region in the

scalar potential and fine-tuning analysis strategies adopted here should also
be applicable to a wide class of Little Higgs and Twin Higgs models, which may
reveal interesting relations as crucial tests of the related EWSB mechanism and
provide a new perspective on assessing their degree of fine-tuning.

transfers knowledge in all the convolutional layers through attention
alignment. Most previous methods align high-level representations, e.g.,
activations of the fully connected (FC) layers. In these methods, however, the
convolutional layers which underpin critical low-level domain knowledge cannot
be updated directly towards reducing domain discrepancy. Specifically, we
assume that the discriminative regions in an image are relatively invariant to
image style changes. Based on this assumption, we propose an attention
alignment scheme on all the target convolutional layers to uncover the
knowledge shared by the source domain. Second, we estimate the posterior label
distribution of the unlabeled data for target network training. Previous
methods, which iteratively update the pseudo labels by the target network and
refine the target network by the updated pseudo labels, are vulnerable to label
estimation errors. Instead, our approach uses category distribution to
calculate the cross-entropy loss for training, thereby ameliorating the error
accumulation of the estimated labels. The two contributions allow our approach
to outperform the state-of-the-art methods by +2.6% on the Office-31 dataset.

mesh is refined yields an order one-half convergence rate in transient spray
simulations. First order convergence would require a doubling of the number of
parcels per cell when the cell size is halved. Second order convergence would
require increasing the number of parcels per cell by a factor of eight. The
results show that controlling statistical error requires dramatically larger

caching can help to reduce the residual interference power, making multiple
decoding orders at the users feasible. The resulting flexibility in decoding
can be exploited for improved NOMA detection. We characterize the achievable
rate region of cache-aided NOMA and derive the Pareto optimal rate tuples

the variation evolution principle, is further developed to be more flexible in
solving the Optimal Control Problems (OCPs) with terminal constraint. With the
first-order stable dynamics to eliminate the infeasibilities, the Modified
Evolution Partial Differential Equation (MEPDE) that is valid in the infeasible
solution domain is proposed, and a Lyapunov functional is constructed to
theoretically ensure its validity. In particular, it is proved that even with
the infinite-time convergence dynamics, the violated terminal inequality
constraints, which are inactive for the optimal solution, will enter the
feasible domain in finite time. Through transforming the MEPDE to the
finite-dimensional Initial-value Problem (IVP) with the semi-discrete method,
the OCPs may be solved with common Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)
numerical integration methods. Illustrative examples are presented to show the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

advances in either speed (e.g., with correlation filters) or accuracy (e.g.,

remain scarce. In this paper we study the problem from a new perspective and
present a novel parallel tracking and verifying (PTAV) framework, by taking
advantage of the ubiquity of multi-thread techniques and borrowing ideas from
the success of parallel tracking and mapping in visual SLAM. The proposed PTAV
framework is typically composed of two components, a (base) tracker T and a
verifier V, working in parallel on two separate threads. The tracker T aims to
provide a super real-time tracking inference and is expected to perform well
most of the time; by contrast, the verifier V validates the tracking results
and corrects T when needed. The key innovation is that, V does not work on
every frame but only upon the requests from T; on the other end, T may adjust
the tracking according to the feedback from V. With such collaboration, PTAV
enjoys both the high efficiency provided by T and the strong discriminative
power by V. Meanwhile, to adapt V to object appearance changes over time, we
maintain a dynamic target template pool for adaptive verification, resulting in
further performance improvements. In our extensive experiments on popular
benchmarks including OTB2015, TC128, UAV20L and VOT2016, PTAV achieves the best
tracking accuracy among all real-time trackers, and in fact even outperforms
many deep learning based algorithms. Moreover, as a general framework, PTAV is
very flexible with great potentials for future improvement and generalization.

networks. With a large number of antennas at the Base Station, both spectral

estimation overhead scales linearly with the number of antennas. This burden is
easily mitigated in TDD systems by the use of the channel reciprocity property.
However, this is unfeasible for FDD systems and the method of two-stage
beamforming was therefore developed to reduce the amount of channel state
information feedback. The performance of this scheme being highly dependent on
the users grouping and scheduling mechanims, we introduce in this paper a new
similarity measure coupled with a novel clustering procedure to achieve the
appropriate users grouping. We also proceed to formulate the optimal users
scheduling policy in JSDM and prove that it is NP-hard. This result is of
paramount importance since it suggests that, unless P=NP, there are no
polynomial time algorithms that solve the general scheduling problem to global
optimality and the use of sub-optimal scheduling strategies is more realistic
in practice. We therefore use graph theory to develop a sub-optimal users
scheduling scheme that runs in polynomial time and outperforms the scheduling
schemes previously introduced in the literature for JSDM in both sum-rate and

infinite abstractions of interconnected discrete-time stochastic control
systems. The proposed approach uses the interconnection matrix and joint
dissipativity-type properties of subsystems and their abstractions described by
a new notion of so-called stochastic storage functions. The interconnected
abstraction framework is based on new notions of so-called stochastic
simulation functions, using which one can quantify the distance between
original interconnected stochastic control systems and interconnected
abstractions in the probabilistic setting. In the first part of the paper, we
derive dissipativity-type compositional reasoning for the quantification of the
distance in probability between the interconnection of stochastic control
subsystems and that of their abstractions. Moreover, we focus on a class of
discrete-time nonlinear stochastic control systems with independent noises in
the abstract and concrete subsystems, and propose a computational scheme to
construct abstractions together with their corresponding stochastic storage
functions. In the second part of the paper, we consider specifications
expressed as syntactically co-safe linear temporal logic formulae and show how
a synthesized policy for the abstract system can be refined to a policy for the
original system while providing guarantee on the probability of satisfaction.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results by constructing an
abstraction (totally 3 dimensions) of the interconnection of three
discrete-time nonlinear stochastic control subsystems (together 222 dimensions)
in a compositional fashion. We also employ the abstraction as a substitute to
synthesize a controller enforcing a syntactically co-safe linear temporal logic
specification.

to multi-chip concepts, where components can be individually optimized and
tested on separate dies before integration into more complex systems. The
assembly of such systems, however, still represents a major challenge,
requiring complex and expensive processes for high-precision alignment as well
as careful adaptation of optical mode profiles. Here we show that these
challenges can be overcome by in-situ nano-printing of freeform beam-shaping
elements to facets of optical components. The approach is applicable to a wide
variety of devices and assembly concepts and allows adaptation of vastly
dissimilar mode profiles while considerably relaxing alignment tolerances to
the extent that scalable, cost-effective passive assembly techniques can be
used. We experimentally prove the viability of the concept by fabricating and
testing a selection of beam-shaping elements at chip and fiber facets,
achieving coupling efficiencies of up to 88 % between an InP laser and an
optical fiber. We also demonstrate printed freeform mirrors for simultaneously
adapting beam shape and propagation direction, and we explore multi-lens
systems for beam expansion. The concept paves the way to automated fabrication

electroencephalograms (EEG). However, manual analysis of EEG data requires
highly trained clinicians, and is a procedure that is known to have relatively
low inter-rater agreement (IRA). Moreover, the volume of the data and the rate
at which new data becomes available make manual interpretation a
time-consuming, resource-hungry, and expensive process. In contrast, automated
analysis of EEG data offers the potential to improve the quality of patient
care by shortening the time to diagnosis and reducing manual error. In this
paper, we focus on one of the first steps in interpreting an EEG session -
identifying whether the brain activity is abnormal or normal. To solve this
task, we propose a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture termed
ChronoNet which is inspired by recent developments from the field of image
classification and designed to work efficiently with EEG data. ChronoNet is
formed by stacking multiple 1D convolution layers followed by deep gated
recurrent unit (GRU) layers where each 1D convolution layer uses multiple
filters of exponentially varying lengths and the stacked GRU layers are densely
connected in a feed-forward manner. We used the recently released TUH Abnormal
EEG Corpus dataset for evaluating the performance of ChronoNet. Unlike previous
studies using this dataset, ChronoNet directly takes time-series EEG as input
and learns meaningful representations of brain activity patterns. ChronoNet
outperforms the previously reported best results by 7.79% thereby setting a new
benchmark for this dataset. Furthermore, we demonstrate the domain-independent
nature of ChronoNet by successfully applying it to classify speech commands.

However, these network-centric methods usually do not fulfill the interests of

applications' deadlines, monetary cost and energy consumption, how the MU
decides whether to offload their traffic to a complementary wireless LAN is an
important issue. Previous studies assume the MU's mobility pattern is known in

directly fed into the convolution neural network in DQN without discretization.
Therefore, not only does the discretization error present in previous work
disappear, but also it makes the proposed algorithm has the ability to
generalize the past experiences, which is especially effective when the number
of states is large. Extensive simulations are conducted to validate our
proposed offloading algorithms.

  Automatic Label Generation",,,,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We tackle the problem of object detection and pose estimation in a shared
space downtown environment. For perception multiple laser scanners with
360{\deg} coverage were fused in a dynamic occupancy grid map (DOGMa). A
single-stage deep convolutional neural network is trained to provide object
hypotheses comprising of shape, position, orientation and an existence score
from a single input DOGMa. Furthermore, an algorithm for offline object
extraction was developed to automatically label several hours of training data.
The algorithm is based on a two-pass trajectory extraction, forward and
backward in time. Typical for engineered algorithms, the automatic label
generation suffers from misdetections, which makes hard negative mining
impractical. Therefore, we propose a loss function counteracting the high
imbalance between mostly static background and extremely rare dynamic grid
cells. Experiments indicate, that the trained network has good generalization
capabilities since it detects objects occasionally lost by the label algorithm.
Evaluation reaches an average precision (AP) of 75.9%

declaration of the value of the statistic statistically significant or
nonsignificant on the bases of a P value derived from a null-hypothesis test.
Taking into account that studies are manly conducted in sample, the use of null
hypothesis testing only allows estimating the true values (population) of the
statistics used. However, evidence has grown in many areas of knowledge that
this approach often leads to confusion and misinterpretation. To overcome this
limitation they have recently emerged recommendations to support the
statistical analysis with approaches that make use of more intuitive
interpretations and more practical, especially based on the magnitudes
(certainty / uncertainty) of the true values found. With the intent to provide
alternative solutions to methodological designs recurrently used in research in
sports sciences, this paper will seek to i) briefly spell out some of the
weaknesses associated with the null hypothesis tests based in the P value; ii)
reflect on the implications of the use of practical/clinical significance as
opposed to statistical significance; iii) submit proposals for use the
inferences based on the magnitude, particularly in the visualization and
interpretation of results; iv) present and discuss the limitations of
magnitude-based inference. Thus, this update article discourages, in a
sustained-based, the use of significance tests based only on the concept of
null hypothesis. Alternatively, it is proposed to use methods of inference
based on magnitudes as they allow interpretations of the practical/clinical
effects results obtained. ----- As investiga\c{c}\~oes em ci\^encias do esporte

  Ceilings, Maternal Walls and Bottlenecks","16 Pages, 5 Figures",,,,"physics.ed-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this study, headcounts of all personnel in Nobel Prize-winning labs were
collected and sorted by gender. These results are used to determine gender
representation of graduate students in elite institutions on the pipeline
towards higher academic positions. Larger gender disparities are seen in
physics and physical chemistry labs and are reduced in biologically focused
labs. These differences are greater in Nobel Prize-winning institutions when
compared to the USA and EU averages. The gender bias in hiring during the
transition between postdoctoral fellow and junior faculty seems to be the
bottleneck for women; exacerbated by family formation. Women who surpass this
hurdle achieve tenure at the same rate and do not perform any worse than men in
such fields. Reduced participation in mathematically intensive fields can also
be traced to propensities of girls preferences to deviate from them as early as
kindergarten. As such, gender disparity may not be due to recalcitrant
pernicious attitudes of individuals towards women. Accumulated advantages such
as societal expectation, asymmetric teaching efforts and acceptance of men to
enter certain fields, over decades, may put men in more favourable positions
while competing for placement in prestigious labs. However, these factors are
sensitive to cultural shifts and show generational effects indicating the
possibility of equality facilitated by sociocultural shifts in expectation for
young women.

this work we provide a systematic methodological framework to construct
Waddington's epigenetic landscape of the GRN involved in cellular determination
during the early stages of development of angiosperms. As a specific example we
consider the flower of the plant \textit{Arabidopsis thaliana}. Our model,
which is based on experimental data, recovers accurately the spatial

quadrature element are proposed for a non-classical Euler-Bernoulli beam
theory. By extending these concept two new plate elements are formulated using
Lagrange-Lagrange and mixed Lagrange-Hermite interpolations for a non-classical
Kirchhoff plate theory. The non-classical theories are governed by sixth order
partial differential equation and have deflection, slope and curvature as de-
grees of freedom. A novel and generalize way is proposed herein to implement
these degrees of freedom in a simple and efficient manner. A new procedure to
compute the modified weighting coefficient matri- ces for beam and plate
elements is presented. The proposed elements have displacement as the only
degree of freedom in the element do- main and displacement, slope and curvature
at the boundaries. The Gauss-Lobatto-Legender quadrature points are considered
as element nodes and also used for numerical integration of the element
matrices. The framework for computing the stiffness matrices at the integra-
tion points is analogous to the conventional finite element method. Numerical
examples on free vibration analysis of gradient beams and plates are presented
to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed elements.
