an attractive possibility to solve a number of discrepancies between

consider this scenario and confront it with measurements of the ionization

the dark matter-photon elastic scattering cross section of $\sigma_{\gamma

astrophysical parameters, the bound on the dark matter-photon scattering cross
section derived here is driven by the estimate of the number of Milky Way
satellite galaxies. Finally, we also argue that future 21~cm probes could help
in disentangling among possible non-cold dark matter candidates, such as
interacting and warm dark matter scenarios. Let us emphasize that bounds of

can present sustained oscillations. These oscillations are possible because of
the effective diffusiophoretic forces that mediate the interactions of colloids
do not respect the action--reaction principle and hence, a Hopf bifurcation is
possible even for overdamped dynamics. Anchoring the particles in one extreme
breaks the head-tail symmetry and the oscillation is transformed into a
traveling wave pattern and thus the chain behaves like a beating cilium. The
net force on the anchor, estimated using the resistive force theory, vanishes
before the bifurcation and thereafter grows linearly with the bifurcation
parameter. If the mobilities of the particles on one extreme are reduced to
mimic an elongated cargo, the traveling wave generates a net velocity on the
chain that now behaves like a moving flagellum. The average velocity again
grows linearly with the bifurcation parameter. Our results demonstrate that
simplified systems, consisting only of a few particles with non-reciprocal
interaction and head-tail asymmetry show beating motion and self-propulsion.
Both properties are present in many non-equilibrium models thus making our
results a general feature of active matter.

structural health of such a railway bridge, is to model the time it takes to
recover to a no-load (baseline) state after a train passes over. Inherently,
this recovery time is random and should be modelled statistically. This paper
uses a non-parametric model, based on empirical quantile approximations, to
construct a space-memory efficient baseline distribution for the streaming data
from these sensors. A fast statistical test is implemented to detect deviations
away from, and recovery back to, this distribution when trains pass over the
bridge, yielding a recovery time. Our method assumes that there are no temporal
variations in the data. A median-based detrending scheme is used to remove the
temporal variations likely due to temperature changes. This allows for the
continuous recording of sensor data with a space-memory constraint.

Vision tasks, such as human pose estimation, did not escape from this trend.
There is a large number of deep models, where small changes in the network
architecture, or in the data pre-processing, together with the stochastic
nature of the optimization procedures, produce notably different results,
making extremely difficult to sift methods that significantly outperform
others. This situation motivates the current study, in which we perform a
systematic evaluation and statistical analysis of vanilla deep regression, i.e.
convolutional neural networks with a linear regression top layer. This is the
first comprehensive analysis of deep regression techniques. We perform
experiments on four vision problems, and report confidence intervals for the
median performance as well as the statistical significance of the results, if
any. Surprisingly, the variability due to different data pre-processing
procedures generally eclipses the variability due to modifications in the
network architecture. Our results reinforce the hypothesis according to which,
in general, a general-purpose network (e.g. VGG-16 or ResNet-50) adequately
tuned can yield results close to the state-of-the-art without having to resort
to more complex and ad-hoc regression models.

by a Raman signature, consisting of an upshift in the frequency of the E2g

(intrinsic or support-induced) is still debated. Herein we use density
functional theory calculations to investigate whether there is an intrinsic
Raman shift in the h-BN monolayer in comparison with the bulk. There is
universal agreement among all tested functionals in predicting the magnitude of
the frequency shift upon a variation in the in-plane cell parameter. It is
clear that a small in-plane contraction can explain the Raman peak upshift from
bulk to monolayer. However, we show that the larger in-plane parameter in the
bulk (compared to the monolayer) results from non-local correlation effects,
which cannot be accounted for by local functionals or those with empirical
dispersion corrections. Using a non-local-correlation functional, we then
investigate the effect of finite temperatures on the Raman signature. We
demonstrate that bulk h-BN thermally expands in the direction perpendicular to
the layers, while the intralayer distances slightly contract, in agreement with
observed experimental behavior. Interestingly, the difference in in-plane cell
parameter between bulk and monolayer decreases with temperature, and becomes
very small at room temperature. We conclude that the different thermal
expansion of bulk and monolayer partially ""erases"" the intrinsic Raman

theory of quantum gravity may imply important constraints on the mass of the
lightest neutrino and the cosmological constant $\Lambda_{4}$. The constraints
come from imposing the absence of any non-SUSY AdS stable vacua obtained from
any consistent compactification of the SM to 3 or 2 dimensions. This condition
comes as a corollary of a recent extension of the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC)
by Ooguri and Vafa. In this paper we study $T^2/Z_N$ compactifications of the
SM to two dimensions in which SM Wilson lines are projected out, leading to a
considerable simplification. We analyze in detail a $T^ 2/Z_4$ compactification
of the SM in which both complex structure and Wilson line scalars are fixed and
the potential is only a function of the area of the torus $a^2$. We find that
the SM is not robust against the appearance of AdS vacua in 2D and hence would
be by itself inconsistent with quantum gravity. On the contrary, if the SM is
embedded at some scale $M_{SS}$ into a SUSY version like the MSSM, the AdS
vacua present in the non-SUSY case disappear or become unstable. This means
that WGC arguments favor a SUSY version of the SM, independently of the usual
hierarchy problem arguments. In a $T^2/Z_4$ compactification in which the
orbifold action is embedded into the $B-L$ symmetry the bounds on neutrino
masses and the cosmological constant are recovered. This suggests that the MSSM
should be extended with a $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge group. In other families of vacua
the spectrum of SUSY particles is further constrained in order to avoid the
appearance of new AdS vacua or instabilities. We discuss a possible
understanding of the little hierarchy problem in this context.

that the COLA method is able to generate promising theoretical predictions for

2-cut of size $m/2 + \Omega(\sqrt{m})$, and this is best possible. That is,
there exist cuts which exceed the expected size of a random cut by some
multiple of the standard deviation. We study analogues of this and related
results in hypergraphs. First, we observe that similarly to graphs, every
m-edge k-uniform hypergraph has an r-cut whose size is $\Omega(\sqrt m)$ larger
than the expected size of a random r-cut. Moreover, in the case where k=3 and
r=2 this bound is best possible and is attained by Steiner triple systems.
Surprisingly, for all other cases (that is, if $k \geq 4$ or $r \geq 3$), we
show that every m-edge k-uniform hypergraph has an r-cut whose size is
$\Omega(m^{5/9})$ larger than the expected size of a random r-cut. This is a
significant difference in behaviour, since the amount by which the size of the
largest cut exceeds the expected size of a random cut is now considerably
larger than the standard deviation.

induce vortices, enhance particle back-transport and increase the shear rate at
the membrane surface, thus mitigating fouling. However, little is known how the
geometry of such turbulence promotors affects the reduction of fouling. We
investigate how different 3D-printed mixer geometries affect fouling and
improve the flux during filtration with humic acid. Most mixer geometries used
in the present study are based on a twisted tape; a Kenics static mixer is
investigated as well. Static mixers with changing diameter prove to be less
effective than twisted tape mixers with constant diameter which lead to an
increase in permeate flux of around 130%. The highest flux improvement of 140%
can be reached by applying a Kenics mixer. Regardless of their geometry, all
investigated static mixer cause higher permeate fluxes at same specific energy
consumption. Again, the Kenics mixer proves to be the most efficient static
mixer. The presented mixer geometries can be fabricated with undercut injection

BSD-GAN, is deliberately split into several sub-vectors, each corresponding to,
and is trained to learn, image representations at a particular scale. During
training, we progressively ""de-freeze"" the sub-vectors, one at a time, as a new

that we can directly manipulate and even combine latent (sub-vector) codes

classical molecular dynamics (MD) and reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) simulations. At
first MD calculations were carried out applying twenty-nine combinations of
ion-water interaction models at four salt concentrations. The structural
predictions of the different models were compared, the contributions of
different structural motifs to the partial pair correlation functions (PPCF)
were determined. Particle configurations obtained from MD simulations were
further refined using the RMC method to get better agreement with experimental
X-ray and neutron diffraction data. The PPCFs calculated from MD simulations
were fitted together with the experimental structure factors to construct
structural models that are as consistent as possible with both the experimental
results and the results of the MD simulations. The MD models were validated
according to the quality of the fits. Although none of the tested MD models can
describe the structure perfectly at the highest investigated concentration,
their comparison made it possible to determine the main structural properties
of that solution as well. It was found that four nearest neighbors (oxygen
atoms and chloride ions together) are around a lithium ion at each
concentration, while in the surroundings of the chloride ion hydrogen atom
pairs are replaced by one lithium ion as the concentration increases. While in
pure liquid water four water molecules can be found around a central water
molecule, near the solubility limit nearly all water molecules are connected to
two chloride ions (via their hydrogen atoms) and one lithium ion (by their
oxygen atoms).

In this paper, we show that interference strongly constrains the genetic and
phenotypic complexity of evolving systems. Our analysis uses biophysically
grounded evolutionary models for an organism's quantitative molecular
phenotypes, such as fold stability and enzymatic activity of genes. We find a
generic mode of asexual evolution called phenotypic interference with strong
implications for systems biology: it couples the stability and function of
individual genes to the population's global speed of evolution. This mode
occurs over a wide range of evolutionary parameters appropriate for microbial
populations. It generates selection against genome complexity, because the
fitness cost of mutations increases faster than linearly with the number of
genes. Recombination can generate a distinct mode of sexual evolution that
eliminates the superlinear cost. We show that positive selection can drive a
transition from asexual to facultative sexual evolution, providing a specific,
biophysically grounded scenario for the evolution of sex. In a broader context,
our analysis suggests that the systems biology of microbial organisms is
strongly intertwined with their mode of evolution.

in a static double quantum dot we compute the geometric pumping of charge in
the limit of weak tunneling, high temperature and slow driving. We analyze the
pumping responses for all pairs of driving parameters (gate voltage, bias
voltage, tunnel coupling, electron-electron interaction). We show that the
responses are analytically related when these different driving protocols are
governed by the same pumping mechanism, which is characterized by effective
driving parameters that differ from the experimental ones. For static
attractive interaction we find a characteristic pumping resonance despite the
'attractive Coulomb blockade' that hinders stationary transport. Moreover, we
identify a pumping mechanism that is unique to driving of the interaction.
Finally, although a single-dot model with orbital pseudo-spin describes most of
the physics of the mentioned experimental setup, it is crucial to account for
the additional (real-) spin degeneracies of the double dot and the associated
electron-hole symmetry breaking. This is necessary because the pumping response
is more sensitive than DC transport measurements and detects this difference

uncertainties in how sediment core depths relate to ages, how proxy quantities
relate to climate variables, how climate models are specified, and the values
of parameters in climate models. Quantifying these uncertainties is key in
drawing well founded conclusions. Analyses are often performed in separate
stages with, for example, a sediment core's depth-age relation being estimated
as stage one, then fed as an input to calibrate climate models as stage two.

reconstruction, model calibration, and age model estimation. We focus on the
glacial-interglacial cycle over the past 780 kyr, analysing two sediment cores

studies, but provides the full joint specification of all uncertainties,
estimation of model parameters, and the model evidence. By sampling plausible
chronologies from the posterior distribution, we demonstrate that downstream
scientific conclusions can differ greatly both between different sampled
chronologies, and in comparison with conclusions obtained in the complete joint
inferential analysis. We conclude that multi-stage analyses are insufficient

limit, where $N$ is the Hilbert space dimension. For a Hamiltonian drawn from
the Gaussian unitary ensemble, we calculate the ensemble averaged OTOC at all
temperatures. In addition to an early time quadratic growth of the averaged
out-of-time-ordered commutator (OTOC), we determine that the OTOC saturates to
its asymptotic value as a power-law in time, with an exponent that depends both
on temperature, and on one of four classes of operators appearing in the
correlation function, that naturally emerge from this calculation.
Out-of-time-ordered correlation functions of operators that are distributed
around the thermal circle take a time $t_{s}\sim \beta$ to decay at low
temperatures. We generalize these exact results, by demonstrating that
out-of-time-ordered correlation functions averaged over any ensemble of
Hamiltonians that are invariant under unitary conjugation $H \rightarrow {U} H
{U}^{\dagger}$, exhibit power-law decay to an asymptotic value. We argue that
this late-time behavior is a generic feature of unitary dynamics with energy
conservation. Finally, by comparing the OTOC with a commutator-anticommutator

as it pertains to those geometric clusters (defined as connected sets of
nearest-neighbor aligned spins) in the context of Ising models. We show how
data from surface probes can be used to distinguish whether electronic patterns
observed at the surface of a material are confined to the surface, or whether
the patterns originate in the bulk. Whereas thermodynamic critical exponents
are derived from the behavior of Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) clusters, critical
exponents can be similarly defined for geometric clusters. We find that these
geometric critical exponents are not only distinct numerically from the
thermodynamic and uncorrelated percolation exponents, but that they separately
satisfy scaling relations at the critical fixed points discussed in the text.
We furthermore find that the two-dimensional (2D) cross-sections of geometric
clusters in the three-dimensional (3D) Ising model display critical scaling
behavior at the bulk phase transition temperature. In particular, we show that
when considered on a 2D slice of a 3D system, the pair connectivity function
familiar from percolation theory displays more robust critical behavior than
the spin-spin correlation function, and we calculate the corresponding critical
exponent. We discuss the implications of these two distinct length scales in
Ising models. We also calculate the pair connectivity exponent in the clean 2D

This limits BN's usage for training larger models and transferring features to
computer vision tasks including detection, segmentation, and video, which
require small batches constrained by memory consumption. In this paper, we
present Group Normalization (GN) as a simple alternative to BN. GN divides the
channels into groups and computes within each group the mean and variance for
normalization. GN's computation is independent of batch sizes, and its accuracy
is stable in a wide range of batch sizes. On ResNet-50 trained in ImageNet, GN
has 10.6% lower error than its BN counterpart when using a batch size of 2;
when using typical batch sizes, GN is comparably good with BN and outperforms
other normalization variants. Moreover, GN can be naturally transferred from
pre-training to fine-tuning. GN can outperform its BN-based counterparts for
object detection and segmentation in COCO, and for video classification in
Kinetics, showing that GN can effectively replace the powerful BN in a variety
of tasks. GN can be easily implemented by a few lines of code in modern

evolution with zero von Neumann entropy, therefore representing examples of
pure, steady quantum states. Non-equilibrium dynamics featuring a dark state
recently gained a lot of attraction since their implementation in the context
of driven-open quantum systems represents a viable possibility to engineer
unique, pure states. In this work, we analyze a driven many-body spin system,
which undergoes a transition from a dark steady state to a mixed steady state
as a function of the driving strength. This transition connects a zero entropy
(dark) state with a finite entropy (mixed) state and thus goes beyond the realm
of equilibrium statistical mechanics and becomes of genuine nonequilibrium
character. We analyze the relevant long wavelength fluctuations driving this
transition in a regime where the system performs a discontinuous jump from a
dark to a mixed state by means of the renormalization group. This allows us to
approach the nonequilibrium dark state transition and identify similarities and
clear differences to common, equilibrium phase transitions, and to establish
the phenomenology for a first order dark state phase transition.

significant negative gradients in the [Na/Fe] ratio with galaxy centres being
well enhanced in Na abundance by up to 0.5 dex. Finally, we find a gradient in

mass-dependent with the lowest mass galaxies in our sample featuring only a
shallow gradient around a Milky Way IMF. Our results imply the local
IMF-$\sigma$ relation within galaxies to be even steeper than the global

we use new observations taken in December 2015-January 2016, and historical

seen between the two epochs, on the photoionisation of the wind. The HETGS
spectroscopy shows that the AGN wind in NGC 7469 consists of four ionisation
components, with their outflow velocities ranging from -400 to -1800 km/s. From
our modelling we find that the change in the ionising continuum shape between
the two epochs results in some variation in the ionisation state of the wind
components. However, for the main ions detected in X-rays, the sum of their
column densities over all four components, remains in practice unchanged. For
two of the four components, which are found to be thermally unstable in both
epochs, we obtain 2 < r < 31 pc and 12 < r < 29 pc using the cooling and
recombination timescales. For the other two thermally stable components, we
obtain r < 31 pc and r < 80 pc from the recombination timescale. The results of
our photoionisation modelling and thermal stability analysis suggest that the
absorber components in NGC 7469 are consistent with being a thermally-driven
wind from the AGN torus. Finally, from analysis of the zeroth-order ACIS/HETG

extended over 1.5-12"". This diffuse soft X-ray emission is explained by coronal

similar shape at all radial bins, described by a power law with a slope close
to $-2$ and an exponential truncation around $10^5\ \rm{M}_{\odot}$ . While the
mass functions of the YSCs in the spiral arm and inter-arm regions have similar
truncation masses, the inter-arm region mass function has a significantly
steeper slope than the one in the arm region; a trend that is also observed in
the giant molecular cloud mass function and predicted by simulations. The age
distribution of clusters is dependent on the region considered, and is
consistent with rapid disruption only in dense regions, while little disruption
is observed at large galactocentric distances and in the inter-arm region. The
fraction of stars forming in clusters does not show radial variations, despite
the drop in the $H_2$ surface density measured as function of galactocentric

these fields do not interact with SM fields other than by sharing the same
metric, therefore physics in small curvature regimes is causal, without
contradictions with available experiments. In strongly curved space causality
is lost and solutions must fulfill given equations. The homogeneity problem is
naturally solved by these DM fields since, evolving from our future to our
past, they bring patches that are currently thought to be causally disconnected

equilibrium of DM fields in a strongly curved regime must be shared by the
metric and our fields, therefore we see these patches with the same CMB
temperature. Although we find unlikely that Nature is described by this theory,
we find interesting to conclude that there are not obvious logical nor
observational inconsistencies and we explore its features. Hopefully some

prove the validity of a simplified version of this method for the Dirichlet

for a discrete version of the density of the double layer potential using a low

theories with quenched disorder, in which the couplings vary randomly in space.
We analyze both classical (Euclidean) disorder and quantum disorder,
emphasizing general properties rather than specific cases. The RG flow of the
disorder-averaged theories takes place in the space of their coupling constants
and also in the space of distributions for the disordered couplings, and the
two mix together. We write down a generalization of the Callan-Symanzik
equation for the flow of disorder-averaged correlation functions. We find that
local operators can mix with the response of the theory to local changes in the
disorder distribution, and that the generalized Callan-Symanzik equation mixes
the disorder averages of several different correlation functions. For classical
disorder we show that this can lead to new types of anomalous dimensions and to
logarithmic behavior at fixed points. For quantum disorder we find that the RG
flow always generates a rescaling of time relative to space, which at a fixed
point generically leads to Lifshitz scaling. The dynamical scaling exponent z
behaves as an anomalous dimension (as in other non-relativistic RG flows), and
we compute it at leading order in perturbation theory in the disorder for a
general theory. Our results agree with a previous perturbative computation by
Boyanovsky and Cardy, and with a holographic disorder computation of Hartnoll
and Santos. We also find in quantum disorder that local operators mix with
non-local (in time) operators under the RG, and that there are critical
exponents associated with the disorder distribution that have not previously
been discussed. In large N theories the disorder averages may be computed
exactly, and we verify that they are consistent with the generalized

problems of efficiency and cost. Routing of messages along shortest paths
requires global information about the topology, while spreading by diffusion,
which operates according to local topological features, is informationally
""cheap"" but inefficient. We introduce a stochastic model for network
communication that combines varying amounts of local and global information
about the network topology. The model generates a continuous spectrum of
dynamics that converge onto shortest-path and random-walk (diffusion)
communication processes at the limiting extremes. We implement the model on two
cohorts of human connectome networks and investigate the effects of varying
amounts of local and global information on the network's communication cost. We
identify routing strategies that approach a (highly efficient) shortest-path
communication process with a relatively small amount of global information.
Moreover, we show that the cost of routing messages from and to hub nodes
varies as a function of the amount of global information driving the system's
dynamics. Finally, we implement the model to identify individual subject
differences from a communication dynamics point of view. The present framework
departs from the classical shortest paths vs. diffusion dichotomy, suggesting
instead that brain networks may exhibit different types of communication
dynamics depending on varying functional demands and the availability of
resources.

describe the confinement in terms of the dilaton, the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone

a significant qualitative difference in their dynamics. We show that the EWPT

depends on whether the conductivity has no pole at zero frequency (as in the
case of zero temperature when the band gap of graphene is larger than twice the

and mitigation of outages extremely hard. In this work, we use the emerging

characterization of line failure localizability in transmission systems. Our
results rigorously establish the well perceived intuition in power community
that failures cannot cross bridges, and reveal a finer-grained concept that
encodes more precise information on failure propagations within tree-partition
regions. Specifically, when a non-bridge line is tripped, the impact of this
failure only propagates within well-defined components, which we refer to as
cells, of the tree partition defined by the bridges. In contrast, when a bridge
line is tripped, the impact of this failure propagates globally across the

smaller components in the tree partition; thus spatially localizing line
failures and making the grid less vulnerable to large-scale outages. We
illustrate this approach using the IEEE 118-bus test system and demonstrate
that switching off a negligible portion of transmission lines allows the impact
of line failures to be significantly more localized without substantial changes

provide superior performance, they often lack of safety guarantees. This paper
aims at addressing this problem by introducing a model predictive safety
certification (MPSC) scheme for polytopic linear systems with additive
disturbances. The scheme verifies safety of a proposed learning-based input and
modifies it as little as necessary in order to keep the system within a given
set of constraints. Safety is thereby related to the existence of a model
predictive controller (MPC) providing a feasible trajectory towards a safe
target set. A robust MPC formulation accounts for the fact that the model is
generally uncertain in the context of learning, which allows proving constraint
satisfaction at all times under the proposed MPSC strategy. The MPSC scheme can
be used in order to expand any potentially conservative set of safe states for
learning and we prove an iterative technique for enlarging the safe set.
Finally, a practical data-based design procedure for MPSC is proposed using
scenario optimization.

important mechanism to help in the formation of the coronal region around an
accretion disk and in the production of magnetic reconnection events similar to
those occurring in the solar corona. In this work, we have performed
three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical (3D-MHD) shearing-box numerical
simulations of accretion disks with an initial stratified density distribution
and a strong azimuthal magnetic field with a ratio between the thermal and
magnetic pressures of the order of unity. This study aimed at verifying the
role of these instabilities in driving fast magnetic reconnection in turbulent
accretion disk/corona systems. As we expected, the simulations showed an
initial formation of large-scale magnetic loops due to the PRTI followed by the
development of a nearly steady-state turbulence driven by both instabilities.
In this turbulent environment, we have employed an algorithm to identify the
presence of current sheets produced by the encounter of magnetic flux ropes of
opposite polarity in the turbulent regions of both the corona and the disk. We
computed the magnetic reconnection rates in these locations obtaining average
reconnection velocities in Alfv\'en speed units of the order of $0.13 \pm 0.09$

Koopman and Perron-Frobenius (P-F) operators from noisy time series data. In
most applications, the time-series data obtained from simulation or experiment
is corrupted with either measurement or process noise or both. The existing
results show the applicability of algorithms developed for the finite
dimensional approximation of deterministic system to a random uncertain case.
However, these results hold true only in asymptotic and under the assumption of
infinite data set. In practice the data set is finite, and hence it is
important to develop algorithms that explicitly account for the presence of
uncertainty in data-set. We propose a robust optimization-based framework for
the robust approximation of the transfer operators, where the uncertainty in
data-set is treated as deterministic norm bounded uncertainty. The robust
optimization leads to a min-max type optimization problem for the approximation
of transfer operators. This robust optimization problem is shown to be
equivalent to regularized least square problem. This equivalence between robust
optimization problem and regularized least square problem allows us to comment
on various interesting properties of the obtained solution using robust
optimization. In particular, the robust optimization formulation captures
inherent tradeoffs between the quality of approximation and complexity of
approximation. These tradeoffs are necessary to balance for the proposed
application of transfer operators, for the design of optimal predictor.
Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed robust approximation algorithm
performs better than the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) and DMD
algorithms for a system with process and measurement noise.

flows, introduced in a previous work, which presents short waves, governed by a
nonlinear Schr\""odinger (NLS) equation based on the Lagrangian coordinates of
the fluid, and long waves, governed by the compressible MHD system. The NLS
equation and the compressible MHD system are also explicitly coupled by an
interaction potential in the NLS equation and an interaction surface force in
the momentum equation of the MHD system, both multiplied by a small
coefficient. Since the compressible MHD flow is assumed to have large amplitude
data, possibly forming vacuum, the coefficient of the interaction terms may be
taken as zero, due to the large difference in scale between the two types of
waves. In this case, the whole coupling lies in the Lagrangian coordinates of
the compressible MHD fluid upon which the NLS equation is formulated. However,
due to the possible occurrence of vacuum, these Lagrangian coordinates are not
well defined, and herein lies the importance of the approximation scheme. The
latter consists of a system that formally approximates the SW-LW interaction
system, including non-zero vanishing interaction coefficients, together with an
artificial viscosity in the continuity equation, an artificial energy balance
term, an artificial pressure in the momentum equation and approximate
Lagrangian coordinates, which circumvent the possible occurrence of vacuum. We
prove the convergence of the solutions of the approximation scheme to a
solution of a system consisting of a NLS equation based on the coordinate
system induced by the scheme, and a compressible MHD system.

formalized in Finsler geometry, a more general theory of space-time. In the
present paper the impact of this kind of LIV on neutrino phenomenology is
studied, in particular by analyzing the corrections introduced in neutrino
oscillation probabilities for different values of neutrino energies and
baselines of experimental interest. The possibility of further improving the
present constraints on CPT-even LIV coefficients by means of our analysis is
also discussed.

acts preserving the geometric structure. We apply this to many groups with
piecewise properties in dimension 1, notably piecewise of class C^k, piecewise
affine, piecewise projective (possibly discontinuous).
  We derive various conjugacy results for subgroups with Property FW, or
distorted cyclic subgroups, or more generally in the presence of rigidity
properties for commensurating actions. For instance we obtain, under suitable
assumptions, the conjugacy of a given piecewise affine action to an affine
action on possibly another model. By the same method, we obtain a similar
result in the projective case. An illustrating corollary is the fact that the
group of piecewise projective self-transformations of the circle has no
infinite subgroup with Kazhdan's Property T; this corollary is new even in the
piecewise affine case.
  In addition, we use this to provide of the classification of circle subgroups
of piecewise projective homeomorphisms of the projective line. The piecewise

transcriptional regulators. Recognition of lysine acetylation through a
bromodomain (BRD) component is key to SWI/SNF function; in most eukaryotes,
this function is attributed to SNF2/Brg1.
  Results: Using affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry (AP-MS) we
identified members of a SWI/SNF complex (SWI/SNFTt) in Tetrahymena thermophila.
SWI/SNFTt is composed of 11 proteins, Snf5Tt, Swi1Tt, Swi3Tt, Snf12Tt, Brg1Tt,
two proteins with potential chromatin interacting domains and four proteins
without orthologs to SWI/SNF proteins in yeast or mammals. SWI/SNFTt subunits
localize exclusively to the transcriptionally active macronucleus (MAC) during
growth and development, consistent with a role in transcription. While
Tetrahymena Brg1 does not contain a BRD, our AP-MS results identified a
BRD-containing SWI/SNFTt component, Ibd1 that associates with SWI/SNFTt during
growth but not development. AP-MS analysis of epitope-tagged Ibd1 revealed it
to be a subunit of several additional protein complexes, including putative
SWRTt, and SAGATt complexes as well as a putative H3K4-specific histone methyl
transferase complex. Recombinant Ibd1 recognizes acetyl-lysine marks on
histones correlated with active transcription. Consistent with our AP-MS and
histone array data suggesting a role in regulation of gene expression, ChIP-Seq
analysis of Ibd1 indicated that it primarily binds near promoters and within
gene bodies of highly expressed genes during growth.
  Conclusions: Our results suggest that through recognizing specific histones
marks, Ibd1 targets active chromatin regions of highly expressed genes in
Tetrahymena where it subsequently might coordinate the recruitment of several
chromatin remodeling complexes to regulate the transcriptional landscape of
vegetatively growing Tetrahymena cells.

performance in person re-identification (Re-ID). Existing CNN based methods
utilize global average pooling (GAP) to aggregate intermediate convolutional
features for Re-ID. However, this strategy only considers the first-order
statistics of local features and treats local features at different locations
equally important, leading to sub-optimal feature representation. To deal with
these issues, we propose a novel weighted bilinear coding (WBC) framework for
local feature aggregation in CNN networks to pursue more representative and
discriminative feature representations, which can adapt to other
state-of-the-art methods and improve their performance. In specific, bilinear
coding is used to encode the channel-wise feature correlations to capture
richer feature interactions. Meanwhile, a weighting scheme is applied on the
bilinear coding to adaptively adjust the weights of local features at different
locations based on their importance in recognition, further improving the
discriminability of feature aggregation. To handle the spatial misalignment
issue, we use a salient part net (spatial attention module) to derive salient
body parts, and apply the WBC model on each part. The final representation,
formed by concatenating the WBC encoded features of each part, is both
discriminative and resistant to spatial misalignment. Experiments on three
benchmarks including Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and CUHK03 evidence the
favorable performance of our method against other outstanding methods.

evaluated by the expected difference of function values at the estimated

first-order information like gradients are not directly accessible to the
optimization algorithm. We show that the classical minimax framework of
analysis, which roughly characterizes the worst-case query complexity of an

difficulty of optimizing smooth functions with adaptive function evaluations,
which provides a refined picture of the intrinsic difficulty of zeroth-order

the cosmic transparency at optical wavelengths. Assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM
cosmological model based on BAO and CMB results, redshift dependent deviations
of SN~Ia distances are used to constrain mechanisms that would dim light. The
analysis is based on the most recent Pantheon SN compilation, for which there
is a $0.03\pm0.01 {\textrm \,(\rm stat)}$ mag discrepancy in the distant
supernova distance moduli relative to the $\Lambda$CDM model anchored by
supernovae at $z<0.05$. While there are known systematic uncertainties that
combined could explain the observed offset, here we entertain the possibility
that the discrepancy may instead be explained by scattering of supernova light
in the intergalactic medium (IGM). We focus on two effects: Compton scattering
by free electrons and extinction by dust in the IGM. We find that if the
discrepancy is due entirely to dimming by dust, the measurements can be modeled
with a cosmic dust density $\Omega_{\rm IGM}^{\rm dust} = 8 \cdot 10^{-5}

(2015)]. In the current paper, we extend these results to the higher
dimensional setting. Our framework with a deterministic scheme provides
approximation of viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations, their
spatial derivatives and the backward characteristic curves at the same time,
within an arbitrary time interval. The proof is based on stochastic calculus of
variations with random walks; a priori boundedness of minimizers of the
variational problems that verifies a CFL type stability condition; the law of
large numbers for random walks under the hyperbolic scaling limit. Convergence
of approximation and the rate of convergence are obtained in terms of
probability theory. The idea is reminiscent of the stochastic and variational
approach to the vanishing viscosity method introduced in [Fleming, J. Differ.

quantify the dispersion relation of phonons, together with their damping.
However, the connection of the dynamical structure factor with dynamical
attenuation of wave packets in glasses is still a matter of debate. We focus
here on the analysis of wave packets propagation in numerical models of
amorphous silicon. We show that the DHO fits (Damped Harmonic Oscillator model)
of the dynamical structure factors give a good estimate of the wave packets

and below the mobility edge, a pure diffusive regime without a definite mean
free path is observed. The high-frequency mobility edge is characteristic of a
transition to localized vibrations. Below the Ioffe-Regel criterion, a mixed
regime is evidenced at intermediate frequencies, with a coexistence of
propagative and diffusive wave fronts. The transition between these different

transportation, thus raising the question of the correct modeling of thermal

landmarks in transmission imaging is challenging since image-domain features
characteristic to a certain landmark change substantially depending on the
viewing direction. Consequently and to the best of our knowledge, the above
problem has not yet been addressed. In this work, we present a method to
automatically detect anatomical landmarks in X-ray images independent of the

convolutional layers is trained on synthetically generated data of the pelvic

optimized for code related documents and use search strategies and ranking
techniques that are more optimized for generic, non-code related information.
In this paper, we explore whether a general purpose search engine like Google
is an optimal choice for code-related searches. In particular, we investigate
whether the performance of searching with Google varies for code vs. non-code
related searches. To analyze this, we collect search logs from 310 developers

Leveraging this model, we build an automatic classifier that detects a code and
non-code related query. We confirm the effectiveness of the classifier on
manually annotated queries where the classifier achieves a precision of 87%, a
recall of 86%, and an F1-score of 87%. We apply this classifier to
automatically annotate all the queries in the dataset. Analyzing this dataset,
we observe that code related searching often requires more effort (e.g., time,

Furthermore, the stable and unstable manifolds of the X-lines produce chaotic
scatterings of nearby quantum (Bohmian) trajectories, thus inducing an

writing transactions that are not concurrent with other writers, and
lock-freedom for concurrent writers. The system supports precise garbage
collection in that versions are identified for collection as soon as the last
transaction releases them. As far as we know these are first results that bound
delays for multiple readers and even a single writer. The approach is
particularly useful in situations where read-transactions dominate write
transactions, or where write transactions come in as streams or batches and can
be processed by a single writer (possibly in parallel).
  The approach is based on using functional data structures to support multiple
versions, and an efficient solution to the Version Maintenance (VM) problem for
acquiring, updating and releasing versions. Our solution to the VM problem is
precise, safe and wait-free (PSWF).
  We experimentally validate our approach by applying it to balanced tree data

multiple algorithms for the VM problem, including our PSWF VM algorithm, and

experimentally and theoretically show that the accumulated phase mismatch over

if the phonons overlap in frequency. Moreover, we demonstrate that the strict

placed on the calculation of the ground-state energy and the excitation gap,
especially the latter which plays an important role in quantum annealing. In
pure systems, the finite gap can be obtained by various existing methods such
as the Holstein-Primakoff transform, while the tunneling splitting at
first-order phase transitions has also been studied in detail using instantons
in many previous works. In disordered systems, however, it remains challenging
to compute the gap of large-size systems with specific realization of disorder.
Hitherto, only quantum Monte Carlo techniques are practical for such studies.
Recently, Knysh [Nature Comm. \textbf{7}, 12370 (2016)] proposed a method where
the exponentially large dimensionality of such systems is condensed onto a
random potential of much lower dimension, enabling efficient study of such
systems. Here we propose a slightly different approach, building upon the
method of static approximation of the partition function widely used for
analyzing mean-field models. Quantum effects giving rise to the excitation gap
and non-extensive corrections to the free energy are accounted for by
incorporating dynamical paths into the path integral. The time-dependence of
the trace of the time-ordered exponential of the effective Hamiltonian is
calculated by solving a differential equation perturbatively, yielding a
finite-size series expansion of the path integral. Formulae for the first
excited-state energy are proposed to aid in computing the gap. We illustrate
our approach using the infinite-range ferromagnetic Ising model and the
Hopfield model, both in the presence of a transverse field.

communication technologies. However, due to user mobility, airtime available
for users in the same group to disseminate data is limited. In addition, for
practical consideration, a star network topology among users in the group is
expected. For the former, unfair airtime allocation among the users will
undermine their willingness to participate in MSNs. For the latter, a group
head is required to connect other users. These two problems have to be properly
addressed to enable real implementation and adoption of MSNs. To this aim, we

Nash bargaining solution (NBS) based optimization problems are proposed for a

RGB-D salient object detection. In contrast to existing works, in which RGB-D
values of image pixels are fed directly to a network, the proposed architecture
is composed of a master network for processing RGB values, and a sub-network
making full use of depth cues and incorporate depth-based features into the
master network. To overcome the limited size of the labeled RGB-D dataset for
training, we employ a large conventional RGB dataset to pre-train the master
network, which proves to contribute largely to the final accuracy. Extensive
evaluations over five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method
performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches.

The X-ray emission of one hotspot and 22 knots is well explained as synchrotron
radiations under the equipartition condition; they usually have lower X-ray and
radio luminosities than the others, which may be due to a lower beaming factor.
An inverse Compton (IC) process is involved for explaining the X-ray emission
of the other SEDs. Without considering the equipartition condition, their X-ray
emission can be attributed to the synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) process, but
the derived jet power (P_jet) are not correlated with L_k and most of them are
larger than L_k with more than three orders of magnitude, where L_k is the jet
kinetic power estimated with their radio emission. Under the equipartition
condition, the X-ray emission is well interpreted with the IC process to the
cosmic microwave background photons (IC/CMB). In this scenario, the derived
P_jet of knots and hotspots are correlated with and comparable to L_k. These
results suggest that the IC/CMB model may be the promising interpretation of
their X-ray emission. In addition, a tentative knot-hotspot sequence in the
synchrotron peak-energy--peak-luminosity plane is observed, similar to the
blazar sequence, which may be attributed to their different cooling mechanisms

number of physical settings. A complete theory for their behavior is still
lacking. Recently, a number of studies have investigated the dynamics of zonal
flows using quasilinear theories and the statistical framework of a
second-order cumulant expansion (CE2). A geometrical-optics (GO) reduction of
CE2, derived under an assumption of separation of scales between the
fluctuations and the zonal flow, is studied here numerically. The reduced
model, CE2-GO, has a similar phase-space mathematical structure to the
traditional wave-kinetic equation, but that wave-kinetic equation has been
shown to fail to preserve enstrophy conservation and to exhibit an ultraviolet
catastrophe. CE2-GO, in contrast, preserves nonlinear conservation of both
energy and enstrophy. We show here how to retain these conservation properties
in a pseudospectral simulation of CE2-GO. We then present nonlinear simulations
of CE2-GO and compare with direct simulations of quasilinear (QL) dynamics. We
find that CE2-GO retains some similarities to QL. The partitioning of energy
that resides in the zonal flow is in good quantitative agreement between CE2-GO
and QL. On the other hand, the length scale of the zonal flow does not follow
the same qualitative trend in the two models. Overall, these simulations
indicate that CE2-GO provides a simpler and more tractable statistical paradigm
than CE2, but CE2-GO is missing important physics.

is demonstrated that solutions of nonlocal elasticity problems are exist, and
Eringen constitutive model cannot determine these solutions. To overcome the
limitations of Eringen constitutive models, novel integral and differential
iterative nonlocal residual constitutive models are proposed. Using these two
constitutive models, the sum of the nonlocal residual field at a point is
iteratively formed. Then, this nonlocal residual is imposed to the local

of a local boundary value problem with an imposed nonlocal residual field.
Using any of these constitutive models, a solution is guaranteed for a nonlocal

a major shortcoming as the effective mass density is constant at high

metamaterial-'called tunable fluid-solid composite'-inspired by the functions
of heart and vessels in animals and humans. The proposed metamaterial consists
of several liquid or gas inclusions in a solid matrix, controlled through a
pair of embedded pumps. Both the band gap and effective mass density at high

as demonstrated through a combination of theoretical analysis, numerical
simulation, and experimental testing. Finally, we show that the tunable
fluid-solid metamaterial can be utilized to manipulate wave propagation over a
broad frequency range, providing new avenues for vibration isolation and wave

the strength of DM interaction. The flow portrait of the model is governed by
two global Ising-Kitaev attractors at $(\lambda=\pm1,D=0)$ and a repeller line,
$\lambda=0$. Renormalization flow of concurrence suggests that the $\lambda=0$
line corresponds to a topological phase transition. The gap starts at zero on
this repeller line corresponding to super-fluid phase of underlying bosons; and
flows towards a finite value at the Ising-Kitaev points. At these two fixed
points the spin fields become purely classical, and hence the resulting Ising
degeneracy can be interpreted as topological degeneracy of dual degrees of
freedom. The state of affairs at the Ising-Kitaev fixed point is consistent
with the picture of a p-wave pairing of strength $\lambda$ of Jordan-Wigner
fermions coupled with Chern-Simons gauge fields.

transform the unstructured information about software architecture design into
a structured form which is suitable for recognizing textual entailment between
a requirement scenario and a potential architectural pattern. b) leverage the
rich experiential knowledge embedded in discussions on professional developer
support forums such as Stackoverflow to check the sentiment about a design

(BK) implementation from the ooDACE toolbox, and a polynomial-chaos Kriging

selection derived from the BK and PCK models works by building a UK surrogate
model and then performing optimizations via expected improvement criteria on
the Kriging model with the lowest leave-one-out cross-validation error. Next,
we studied and compared the UK-EGO variants and standard EGO using five
synthetic test functions and one aerodynamic problem. Our results show that the
proper choice for the trend function through automatic feature selection can
improve the optimization performance of UK-EGO relative to EGO. From our
results, we found that PCK-EGO was the best variant, as it had more robust
performance as compared to the rest of the UK-EGO schemes; however, total-order
expansion should be used to generate the candidate trend function set for
high-dimensional problems. Note that, for some test functions, the UK with
predetermined polynomial trend functions performed better than that of BK and
PCK, indicating that the use of automatic trend function selection does not
always lead to the best quality solutions. We also found that although some
variants of UK are not as globally accurate as the ordinary Kriging (OK), they
can still identify better-optimized solutions due to the addition of the trend
function, which helps the optimizer locate the global optimum.

European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software.
  MARS emphasises modelling over verification. It aims at discussing the
lessons learned from making formal methods for the verification and analysis of
realistic systems. Examples are:
  (1) Which formalism is chosen, and why?
  (2) Which abstractions have to be made and why?
  (3) How are important characteristics of the system modelled?
  (4) Were there any complications while modelling the system?
  (5) Which measures were taken to guarantee the accuracy of the model?
  We invited papers that present full models of real systems, which may lay the
basis for future comparison and analysis. An aim of the workshop is to present
different modelling approaches and discuss pros and cons for each of them.
Alternative formal descriptions of the systems presented at this workshop are
encouraged, which should foster the development of improved specification
formalisms.
  VPT aims to provide a forum where people from the areas of program
transformation and program verification can fruitfully exchange ideas and gain
a deeper understanding of the interactions between those two fields. These
interactions have been beneficial in both directions. On the one hand, methods
and tools developed in the field of program transformation, such as partial
deduction, partial evaluation, fold/unfold transformations, and
supercompilation, are applied with success to verification, in particular to
the verification of infinite state and parameterized systems. On the other
hand, methods developed in program verification, such as model checking,
abstract interpretation, SAT and SMT solving, and automated theorem proving,
are used to enhance program transformation techniques, thereby making these
techniques more powerful and useful in practice.

immediately beneath the convection zone in which the seismically inferred sound
speed in the Sun exceeds corresponding values in standard solar models, with a
degree of partial material mixing which we presume to have resulted from a
combination of convective overshoot, wave transport and tachocline circulation.
We first summarize the effects of either modifying in the models the opacity in
the radiative interior or of incorporating either slow or fast tachocline
circulation. Neither alone is successful. We then consider, without physical
justification, incomplete material redistribution immediately beneath the
convection zone which is slow enough not to disturb radiative equilibrium. It
is modelled simply as a diffusion process. We find that, in combination with an
appropriate opacity modification, it is possible to find a density-dependent
diffusion coefficient that removes the glitch almost entirely, with a radiative
envelope that is consistent with seismology.

properties of stable and unstable atomic nuclei. While the elements until iron
are either created during the big bang or during fusion reactions in stars,
most of the elements heavier than iron are produced via neutron-induced
reactions. Therefore, neutron capture cross sections of stable and unstable
isotopes are important. So far, time-of-flight or activation methods have been
applied very successfully, but these methods reach their limits once the
isotopes with half-lives shorter than a few months are of interest. A
combination of a radioactive beam facility, an ion storage ring and a high flux
reactor or a spallation source would allow a direct measurement of
neutron-induced reactions over a wide energy range of isotopes with half-lives
down to minutes. The idea is to measure neutron-induced reactions on
radioactive ions in inverse kinematics. This means, the radioactive ions will
pass through a neutron target. In order to efficiently use the rare nuclides as
well as to enhance the luminosity, the exotic nuclides can be stored in an ion
storage ring. The neutron target can be the core of a research reactor, where
one of the central fuel elements is replaced by the evacuated beam pipe of the
storage ring. Alternatively, a large moderator surrounding a spallation source
can be intersected by the beam pipe of an ion storage ring. Using particle
detectors and Schottky spectroscopy, most of the important neutron-induced

suffer from unwanted boundary effects. Spatially Regularized DCF (SRDCF) has
been suggested to resolve this issue by enforcing spatial penalty on DCF
coefficients, which, inevitably, improves the tracking performance at the price
of increasing complexity. To tackle online updating, SRDCF formulates its model
on multiple training images, further adding difficulties in improving
efficiency. In this work, by introducing temporal regularization to SRDCF with
single sample, we present our spatial-temporal regularized correlation filters
(STRCF). Motivated by online Passive-Agressive (PA) algorithm, we introduce the
temporal regularization to SRDCF with single sample, thus resulting in our
spatial-temporal regularized correlation filters (STRCF). The STRCF formulation
can not only serve as a reasonable approximation to SRDCF with multiple
training samples, but also provide a more robust appearance model than SRDCF in
the case of large appearance variations. Besides, it can be efficiently solved
via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). By incorporating
both temporal and spatial regularization, our STRCF can handle boundary effects
without much loss in efficiency and achieve superior performance over SRDCF in
terms of accuracy and speed. Experiments are conducted on three benchmark
datasets: OTB-2015, Temple-Color, and VOT-2016. Compared with SRDCF, STRCF with
hand-crafted features provides a 5 times speedup and achieves a gain of 5.4%

exposes an inherent fault in these networks and their ability to generalize
well. For this reason, providing robustness to adversarial attacks is an

results and experimental characterization clearly demonstrate the critical
roles of the deposition flux, edge-reaction kinetics and the surface diffusion
of active carbon sources in modulating the pattern evolution and rate of
growth. The contrast in edge-kinetics-limited and surface-diffusion-limited
regimes is remarkable, which can be characterized by the evolution of domain
patterns and considered as an indicator of the growth regime. Common features
exist in these two regimes, showing that the growth rate scales with time as t2
in the early stage of growth and is regime-independent, which is explained by
the coarsen profiles of carbon concentration for both the compact and dendritic
domains. The rate decays rapidly in the final stage of growth due to the
competition between neighboring domains on the limited carbon sources diffusing
on the substrate, which is highly regime-sensitive and extremely low in the
surface-diffusion-limited regime with narrow gaps between the domains to be
filled. Based on these findings, synthesis strategies to improve the growth
efficiency and film quality are discussed.

a spatial map. (2) Due to processing training samples by a spatial map, it is
more general way to control background information and target information in
training samples. The values of the spatial map are not restricted, then a
better spatial map can be explored. (3) The weight proportions of accurate

conventionally produced by a solar-like differential rotation but whose
alpha-effect is assumed to be periodically modulated by planetary tidal
forcing. This resonance-like effect has its rationale in the tendency of the
current-driven Tayler instability to undergo intrinsic helicity oscillations
which, in turn, can be synchronized by periodic tidal perturbations.
Specifically, we focus on the 11.07 years alignment periodicity of the tidally
dominant planets Venus, Earth, and Jupiter, whose persistent synchronization
with the solar dynamo is briefly touched upon. The typically emerging dynamo
modes are dipolar fields, oscillating with a 22.14 years period or pulsating
with a 11.07 years period, but also quadrupolar fields with corresponding
periodicities. In the absence of any constant part of alpha, we prove the
subcritical nature of this Tayler-Spruit type dynamo. The resulting amplitude
of the alpha oscillation that is required for dynamo action turns out to lie in
the order of 1 m/s, which seems not implausible for the sun. When starting with
a more classical, non-periodic part of alpha, even less of the oscillatory
alpha part is needed to synchronize the entire dynamo. Typically, the dipole
solutions show butterfly diagrams, although their shapes are not convincing
yet. Phase coherent transitions between dipoles and quadrupoles, which are
reminiscent of the observed behaviour during the Maunder minimum, can be easily
triggered by long-term variations of dynamo parameters, but may also occur
spontaneously even for fixed parameters. Further interesting features of the
model are the typical second intensity peak and the intermittent appearance of
reversed helicities in both hemispheres.

consensus beyond their computational power. However, PoW-based systems incur a
high delay and low throughput, making them ineffective in dealing with

employed in closed (permissioned) settings to avoid Sybil attacks. In this
paper, we present Sybil-proof wirelEss Network coordinAte based byzanTine

Sybil attacks. As in a Senate in the legislature where the quota of senators
per state (district) is a constant irrespective with the population of the
state, ""senators"" in SENATE are selected from participating distributed nodes
based on their wireless network coordinates (WNC) with a fixed number of nodes
per district in the WNC space. Elected senators then participate in the
subsequent consensus reaching process and broadcast the result. Thereby, SENATE
is proof against Sybil attacks since pseudonyms of a faulty node are likely to
be adjacent in the WNC space and hence fail to be elected.

technological evolution is often a complex and elusive topic in science. The
study here starts by establishing a conceptual framework of technological
evolution based on the theory of technological parasitism, in broad analogy
with biology. Then, the measurement of the evolution of technology is modelled
in terms of morphological changes within complex systems considering the
interaction between a host technology and its subsystems of technology. The
coefficient of evolutionary growth of the model here indicates the grade and
type of the evolutionary route of a technology. This coefficient is quantified
in real instances using historical data of farm tractor, freight locomotive and

solution is to retain only part of it. In practice this takes a wide variety of
different forms, and among them ""coresets"" are especially appealing. A coreset
is a (small) weighted sample of the original data that comes with the following
guarantee: a cost function can be evaluated on the smaller set instead of the
larger one, with low relative error. For some classes of problems, and via a
careful choice of sampling distribution (based on the so-called ""sensitivity""
metric), iid random sampling has turned to be one of the most successful
methods for building coresets efficiently. However, independent samples are
sometimes overly redundant, and one could hope that enforcing diversity would
lead to better performance. The difficulty lies in proving coreset properties
in non-iid samples. We show that the coreset property holds for samples formed
with determinantal point processes (DPP). DPPs are interesting because they are
a rare example of repulsive point processes with tractable theoretical
properties, enabling us to prove general coreset theorems. We apply our results
to both the k-means and the linear regression problems, and give extensive
empirical evidence that the small additional computational cost of DPP sampling
comes with superior performance over its iid counterpart. Of independent
interest, we also provide analytical formulas for the sensitivity in the linear
regression and 1-means cases.

generalized manifolds to finite Poincar\'{e} duality complexes (PD complexes).
The problem is that an arbitrary generalized manifold $X$ is always an ENR
space, but it is not necessarily a complex. Moreover, finite PD complexes
require the Poincar\'{e} duality with coefficients in the group ring $\Lambda$
($\Lambda$-complexes). Standard homology theory implies that $X$ is a
$\mathbb{Z}$-PD complex. Therefore by Browder's theorem, $X$ has a Spivak
normal fibration which in turn, determines a Thom class of the pair
$(N,\partial N)$ of a mapping cylinder neighborhood of $X$ in some Euclidean
space. Then $X$ satisfies the $\Lambda$-Poincar\'{e} duality if this class
induces an isomorphism with $\Lambda$-coefficients. Unfortunately, the proof of
Browder's theorem gives only isomorphisms with $\mathbb{Z}$-coefficients. It is
also not very helpful that $X$ is homotopy equivalent to a finite complex $K$,
because $K$ is not automatically a $\Lambda$-PD complex. Therefore it is
convenient to introduce $\Lambda$-PD structures. To prove their existence on
$X$, we use the construction of $2$-patch spaces and some fundamental results
of Bryant, Ferry, Mio, and Weinberger. Since the class of all $\Lambda$-PD
complexes does not contain all generalized manifolds, we appropriately enlarge
this class and then describe (i.e. recognize) generalized manifolds within this
enlarged class in terms of the Gromov-Hausdorff metric

1 m s-1 with a state of the art laser frequency comb for the wavelength

noise is a change of intensity distribution of multi-mode fiber exit, which
degrades RV measurement precision. To stabilize the intensity distribution of
fiber exit an introduction of fiber mode scrambler is mandatory. Several kinds
of mode scramblers have been suggested in previous research, though it is
necessary to determine the most appropriate mode scrambler system for IRD.

correlated with $M_{\rm BH}$ and $L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm Edd}$ is not correlated with

this work, an effective approach to integrate coarse camera view information as
well as fine-grained pose information into a convolutional neural network (CNN)

  A brick $G$ is near-bipartite if it has a pair of edges $\{e,f\}$ so that
$G-e-f$ is matching covered and bipartite; such a pair $\{e,f\}$ is a removable
doubleton. (Each of $K_4$ and the triangular prism $\overline{C_6}$ has three
removable doubletons.) Carvalho, Lucchesi and Murty (2002) proved a conjecture
of Lov\'asz which states that every brick, distinct from $K_4$,
$\overline{C_6}$ and the Petersen graph, has a $b$-invariant edge.
  A cubic graph is essentially $4$-edge-connected if it is $2$-edge-connected
and if its only $3$-cuts are the trivial ones; it is well-known that each such
graph is either a brick or a brace; we provide a graph-theoretical proof of
this fact.
  We prove that if $G$ is any essentially $4$-edge-connected cubic brick then
its edge-set may be partitioned into three (possibly empty) sets: (i) edges
that participate in a removable doubleton, (ii) $b$-invariant edges, and (iii)
quasi-$b$-invariant edges; our Main Theorem states that if $G$ has two adjacent
quasi-$b$-invariant edges, say $e_1$ and $e_2$, then either $G$ is the Petersen
graph or the (near-bipartite) Cubeplex graph, or otherwise, each edge of $G$
(distinct from $e_1$ and $e_2$) is $b$-invariant. As a corollary, we deduce
that each essentially $4$-edge-connected cubic non-near-bipartite brick $G$,
distinct from the Petersen graph, has at least $|V(G)|$ $b$-invariant edges.

relaxation channels. Superconducting gaps play an important role in the design
of such environments. The interaction of localized single spins with a
conventional superconductor generally leads to intrinsically extremely narrow
Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) resonances protected inside the superconducting gap.
However, this may not apply to superconductors with nontrivial, energy
dependent order parameters. Exploiting the Fe-doped two-band superconductor
NbSe$_2$, we show that due to the nontrivial relation between its complex
valued and energy dependent order parameters, YSR states are no longer
restricted to be inside the gap. They can appear outside the gap (i. e. inside
the coherence peaks), where they can also acquire a substantial intrinsic
lifetime broadening. T-matrix scattering calculations show excellent agreement
with the experimental data and relate the intrinsic YSR state broadening to the
imaginary part of the host's order parameters. Our results suggest that
non-thermal relaxation mechanisms contribute to the finite lifetime of the YSR
states, even within the superconducting gap, making them less protected against
residual interactions than previously assumed. YSR states may serve as valuable
probes for nontrivial order parameters promoting a judicious selection of
protective superconductors.

number of solid, pebble-sized objects that are still present in the
protoplanetary disc. It is still an open question on how efficient this process
works in realistic turbulent discs. Here, we investigate the accretion of
pebbles in turbulent discs that are driven by the purely hydrodynamical
vertical shear instability (VSI). For this purpose, we perform global
three-dimensional simulations of locally isothermal, VSI turbulent discs with
embedded protoplanetary cores from 5 to 100 $M_\oplus$ that are placed at 5.2
au distance from the star. In addition, we follow the evolution of a swarm of
embedded pebbles of different size under the action of drag forces between gas
and particles in this turbulent flow. Simultaneously, we perform a set of
comparison simulations for laminar viscous discs where the particles experience
stochastic kicks. For both cases, we measure the accretion rate onto the cores
as a function of core mass and Stokes number ($\tau_s$) of the particles and
compare it to recent MRI turbulence simulations. Overall the dynamic is very
similar for the particles in the VSI turbulent disc and the laminar case with
stochastic kicks. For the small mass planets (i.e. 5 and 10 $M_\oplus$),
well-coupled particles with $\tau_s = 1$, which have a size of about one meter
at this location, we find an accretion efficiency (rate of particles accreted
over drifting inward) of about 1.6-3%. For smaller and larger particles this
efficiency is higher. However, the fast inward drift for $\tau_s = 1$ particles
makes them the most effective for rapid growth, leading to mass doubling times
of about 20,000 yr. For masses between 10 and 30 $M_\oplus$ the core reaches
the pebble isolation mass and the particles are trapped at the pressure maximum
just outside of the planet, shutting off further particle accretion.

particular supergravity theory, which we refer to as D=4 generalized
AdS-Lorentz deformed supergravity, in the presence of a non-trivial boundary.
In particular, we show that the so-called generalized minimal AdS-Lorentz
superalgebra can be interpreted as a peculiar torsion deformation of osp(4|1),
and we present the construction of a bulk Lagrangian based on the
aforementioned generalized AdS-Lorentz superalgebra. In the presence of a
non-trivial boundary of space-time, that is when the boundary is not thought of
as set at infinity, the fields do not asymptotically vanish, and this has some
consequences on the invariances of the theory, in particular on supersymmetry
invariance. In this work, we adopt the so-called rheonomic (geometric) approach
in superspace and show that a supersymmetric extension of a Gauss-Bonnet like
term is required in order to restore the supersymmetry invariance of the
theory. The action we end up with can be recast as a MacDowell-Mansouri type
action, namely as a sum of quadratic terms in the generalized AdS-Lorentz
covariant super field-strengths.

performance, but have limits when used in robotic applications. One of the most
relevant issues is the long training time, which is due to the large size and
imbalance of the associated training sets, characterized by few positive and a
large number of negative examples (i.e. background). Proposed approaches are
based on end-to-end learning by back-propagation [22] or kernel methods trained
with Hard Negatives Mining on top of deep features [8]. These solutions are
effective, but prohibitively slow for on-line applications. In this paper we
propose a novel pipeline for object detection that overcomes this problem and
provides comparable performance, with a 60x training speedup. Our pipeline
combines (i) the Region Proposal Network and the deep feature extractor from
[22] to efficiently select candidate RoIs and encode them into powerful
representations, with (ii) the FALKON [23] algorithm, a novel kernel-based
method that allows fast training on large scale problems (millions of points).
We address the size and imbalance of training data by exploiting the stochastic
subsampling intrinsic into the method and a novel, fast, bootstrapping

attracted substantial interest in condensed matter systems as well as in
classical wave systems. Among these energy bands, the type-II Dirac point is a
nodal degeneracy with tilted conical dispersion, leading to a peculiar crossing
dispersion in the constant energy plane. Such nodal points have recently been
found in electronic materials. The analogous topological feature in photonic
systems remains a theoretical curiosity, with experimental realization expected
to be challenging. Here, we experimentally realize the type-II Dirac point
using a planar metasurface architecture, where the band degeneracy point is
protected by the underlying mirror symmetry of the metasurface. Gapless edge
modes are found and measured at the boundary between the different domains of
the symmetry-broken metasurface. Our work shows that metasurfaces are simple
and practical platforms for realizing electromagnetic type-II Dirac points, and
their planar structure is a distinct advantage that facilitates applications in
two-dimensional topological photonics.

instability (MRI) itself: local simulations indicate that the large-scale
properties of the turbulence (e.g. saturation levels, the stress-pressure
relationship) depend on the short dissipative scales. In this paper we
undertake a numerical study of how the MRI dissipates and the small-scale
dissipative structures it employs to do so. We use the Godunov code RAMSES and
unstratified compressible shearing boxes. Our simulations reveal that
dissipation is concentrated in ribbons of strong magnetic reconnection that are
significantly elongated in azimuth, up to a scale height. Dissipative
structures are hence meso-scale objects, and potentially provide a route by
which large scales and small scales interact. We go on to show how these
ribbons evolve over time --- forming, merging, breaking apart, and
disappearing. Finally, we reveal important couplings between the large-scale
density waves generated by the MRI and the small-scale structures, which may
illuminate the stress-pressure relationship in MRI turbulence.

on which there is a common generalization of the Gowers norms and the Host-Kra
seminorms. Our main result yields a complete structural description of cubic
couplings, using nilspaces. We give three applications. Firstly, we describe
the characteristic factors of Host-Kra type seminorms for measure-preserving
actions of countable nilpotent groups. This yields an extension of the
structure theorem of Host and Kra. Secondly, we characterize sequences of
random variables with a property that we call cubic exchangeability. These are
sequences indexed by the infinite discrete cube, such that for every integer
$k\geq 0$ the joint distribution's marginals on affine subcubes of dimension
$k$ are all equal. In particular, our result gives a description, in terms of
compact nilspaces, of a related exchangeability property considered by Austin,
inspired by a problem of Aldous. Finally, using nilspaces we obtain limit
objects for sequences of functions on compact abelian groups (more generally on
compact nilspaces) such that the densities of certain patterns in these
functions converge. The paper thus proposes a measure-theoretic framework on
which the area of higher-order Fourier analysis can be based, and which yields
new applications of this area in a unified way in ergodic theory and arithmetic
combinatorics.

non-centrosimmetric materials or ultrathin films with strong spin-orbit

turnstile models. Unfortunately, many important streaming problems require a
$\Theta(\log(n))$ multiplicative factor more space for turnstile streams than
for insertion-only streams. This complexity gap often arises because the
underlying frequency vector $f$ is very close to $0$, after accounting for all
insertions and deletions to items. Signal detection in such streams is
difficult, given the large number of deletions.
  In this work, we propose an intermediate model which, given a parameter
$\alpha \geq 1$, lower bounds the norm $\|f\|_p$ by a $1/\alpha$-fraction of
the $L_p$ mass of the stream had all updates been positive. Here, for a vector
$f$, $\|f\|_p = \left (\sum_{i=1}^n |f_i|^p \right )^{1/p}$, and the value of
$p$ we choose depends on the application. This gives a fluid medium between
insertion only streams (with $\alpha = 1$), and turnstile streams (with $\alpha
= \text{poly}(n)$), and allows for analysis in terms of $\alpha$.
  We show that for streams with this $\alpha$-property, for many fundamental
streaming problems we can replace a $O(\log(n))$ factor in the space usage for
algorithms in the turnstile model with a $O(\log(\alpha))$ factor. This is true
for identifying heavy hitters, inner product estimation, $L_0$ estimation,
$L_1$ estimation, $L_1$ sampling, and support sampling. For each problem, we
give matching or nearly matching lower bounds for $\alpha$-property streams. We
note that in practice, many important turnstile data streams are in fact
$\alpha$-property streams for small values of $\alpha$. For such applications,

consisting of several interacting components. Often, they can be given a causal
interpretation in the sense that they not only model the evolution of the
states of the system's components over time, but also describe how their
evolution is affected by external interventions on the system that perturb the
dynamics. We introduce the formal framework of structural dynamical causal
models (SDCMs) that explicates the causal semantics of the system's components
as part of the model. SDCMs represent a dynamical system as a collection of
stochastic processes and specify the basic causal mechanisms that govern the
dynamics of each component as a structured system of random differential
equations of arbitrary order. SDCMs extend the versatile causal modeling
framework of structural causal models (SCMs), also known as structural equation
models (SEMs), by explicitly allowing for time-dependence. An SDCM can be
thought of as the stochastic-process version of an SCM, where the static random
variables of the SCM are replaced by dynamic stochastic processes and their
derivatives. We provide the foundations for a theory of SDCMs, by (i) formally
defining SDCMs, their solutions, stochastic interventions, and a graphical
representation; (ii) studying existence and uniqueness of the solutions for
given initial conditions; (iii) providing Markov properties for SDCMs with
initial conditions; (iv) discussing under which conditions SDCMs equilibrate to
SCMs as time tends to infinity; (v) relating the properties of the SDCM to
those of the equilibrium SCM. This correspondence enables one to leverage the
wealth of statistical tools and discovery methods available for SCMs when
studying the causal semantics of a large class of stochastic dynamical systems.
The theory is illustrated with examples from different scientific domains.

the presence of a cyclostationary signal in various scenarios with structured

about the noise process have enhanced performance. We have previously derived
GLRTs for these specific scenarios; here, we examine the existence of LMPITs.
We show that these exist only for detecting the presence of a cyclostationary

exist. Instead, we propose tests that approximate the LMPIT, and they are shown
to perform well in simulations. Finally, if the noise structure is not known in

recipe of context-based kernel design consists in learning positive
semi-definite similarity functions that return high values not only when data
share similar content but also similar context. However, in spite of having a
positive impact on performance, the use of context in these kernel design
methods has not been fully explored; indeed, context has been handcrafted
instead of being learned. In this paper, we introduce a novel context-aware
kernel design framework based on deep learning. Our method discriminatively
learns spatial geometric context as the weights of a deep network (DN). The
architecture of this network is fully determined by the solution of an
objective function that mixes content, context and regularization, while the
parameters of this network determine the most relevant (discriminant) parts of
the learned context. We apply this context and kernel learning framework to
image classification using the challenging ImageCLEF Photo Annotation

cognitive processes in the human brain. A prominent example is functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which is a noisy measurement of a delayed
signal that depends non-linearly on the neuronal activity through the
neurovascular coupling. These characteristics make the inference of neuronal
activity from fMRI a difficult but important step in fMRI studies that require
information at the neuronal level. In this article, we address this inference
problem using a Bayesian approach where we model the latent neural activity as
a stochastic process and assume that the observed BOLD signal results from a
realistic physiological (Balloon) model. We apply a recently developed
smoothing method called APIS to efficiently sample the posterior given single
event fMRI time series. To infer neuronal signals with high likelihood for
multiple time series efficiently, a modification of the original algorithm is
introduced. We demonstrate that our adaptive procedure is able to compensate
the lacking of inputs in the model to infer the neuronal activity and that it
outperforms dramatically the standard bootstrap particle filter-smoother in
this setting. This makes the proposed procedure especially attractive to
deconvolve resting state fMRI data. To validate the method, we evaluate the
quality of the signals inferred using the timing information contained in them.
APIS obtains reliable event timing estimates based on fMRI data gathered during
a reaction time experiment with short stimuli. Hence, we show for the first
time that one can obtain accurate absolute timing of neuronal activity by
reconstructing the latent neural signal.

in LS, whose main property, the resolution of topological features and changes
in the differential energy loss $\mathrm{d}E/\mathrm{d}x$, allows for improved
rejection strategies. Different to common track reconstruction approaches, our
method does not rely on concrete track / topology hypotheses. Instead, based on
a reference point in space and time, the observed distribution of photon
arrival times at the photosensors and the detector's characteristics in terms
of photon production, propagation and detection (optical model), it
reconstructs the voxelized distribution of optical photon emissions. Techniques
from three-dimensional data analysis can then be applied to extract parameters
describing the topology, e.g., the direction of a track. We performed a first

networks to estimate crowd density in the image plane. While useful for this
purpose, this image-plane density has no immediate physical meaning because it
is subject to perspective distortion. This is a concern in sequences acquired
by drones because the viewpoint changes often. This distortion is usually
handled implicitly by either learning scale-invariant features or estimating
density in patches of different sizes, neither of which accounts for the fact
that scale changes must be consistent over the whole scene.
  In this paper, we explicitly model the scale changes and reason in terms of
people per square-meter. We show that feeding the perspective model to the
network allows us to enforce global scale consistency and that this model can
be obtained on the fly from the drone sensors. In addition, it also enables us
to enforce physically-inspired temporal consistency constraints that do not
have to be learned. This yields an algorithm that outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in inferring crowd density from a moving drone camera especially when
perspective effects are strong.

longitude for a few tens of rotations before reverting to the usual phase for
approximately several hundred to more than a thousand rotations. These events,
where the pulse moves in phase by up to 5$^{\circ}$, have been previously
detected in observations from $\sim$300 to 2000 MHz. We present simultaneous
observations from the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope at 1350 MHz and the
Bornim (Potsdam) station of the LOw Frequency ARray at 150 MHz. Our
observations present the first evidence for an absence of the anomalous
phase-shifting behaviour at 150 MHz. Instead, the observed intensity at the
usual pulse-phase typically decreases, often showing a pseudo-nulling feature
corresponding to the times when phase shifts are observed at 1350 MHz. The
presence of weak emission at the usual pulse-phase supports the theory that
these shifts may result from processes similar to the 'profile-absorption'
expected to operate for PSR J0814+7429 (B0809+74). A possible mechanism for
this could be intrinsic variations of the emission within the pulsar's beam
combined with absorption by expanding shells of electrons in the line of sight.

concentration, with current models favoring the streaming instability.
Planetesimals grow into Mars-sized (or larger) planetary embryos by a
combination of pebble- and planetesimal accretion. Models for the final
assembly of the inner Solar System must match constraints related to the
terrestrial planets and asteroids including their orbital and compositional
distributions and inferred growth timescales. Two current models -- the
Grand-Tack and low-mass (or empty) primordial asteroid belt scenarios -- can
each match the empirical constraints but both have key uncertainties that
require further study. We present formation models for close-in super-Earths --
the closest current analogs to our own terrestrial planets despite their very
different formation histories -- and for terrestrial exoplanets in gas giant
systems. We explain why super-Earth systems cannot form in-situ but rather may
be the result of inward gas-driven migration followed by the disruption of
compact resonant chains. The Solar System is unlikely to have harbored an early
system of super-Earths; rather, Jupiter's early formation may have blocked the
ice giants' inward migration. Finally, we present a chain of events that may

inequalities. The method uses variable stepsizes that are computed using two
previous iterates as an approximation of the local Lipschitz constant without
running a linesearch. Thus, each iteration of the method requires only one
evaluation of a monotone operator $F$ and a proximal mapping $g$. The operator
$F$ need not be Lipschitz-continuous, which also makes the algorithm
interesting in the area of composite minimization where one cannot use the
descent lemma. The method exhibits an ergodic $O(1/k)$ convergence rate and
$R$-linear rate, if $F, g$ satisfy the error bound condition. We discuss
possible applications of the method to fixed point problems. We discuss
possible applications of the method to fixed point problems as well as its

modality that allows performing in vivo optical biopsies. The design of pCLE
hardware, and its reliance on an optical fibre bundle, fundamentally limits the
image quality with a few tens of thousands fibres, each acting as the
equivalent of a single-pixel detector, assembled into a single fibre bundle.
Video-registration techniques can be used to estimate high-resolution (HR)
images by exploiting the temporal information contained in a sequence of
low-resolution (LR) images. However, the alignment of LR frames, required for
the fusion, is computationally demanding and prone to artefacts. Methods: In
this work, we propose a novel synthetic data generation approach to train
exemplar-based Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). HR pCLE images with enhanced
quality are recovered by the models trained on pairs of estimated HR images
(generated by the video-registration algorithm) and realistic synthetic LR
images. Performance of three different state-of-the-art DNNs techniques were
analysed on a Smart Atlas database of 8806 images from 238 pCLE video
sequences. The results were validated through an extensive Image Quality
Assessment (IQA) that takes into account different quality scores, including a
Mean Opinion Score (MOS). Results: Results indicate that the proposed solution
produces an effective improvement in the quality of the obtained reconstructed
image. Conclusion: The proposed training strategy and associated DNNs allows us
to perform convincing super-resolution of pCLE images.

results give improved upper and lower bounds on the ""price of asynchrony"" when
executing the fundamental SGD algorithm in a concurrent setting. They show that
this classic optimization tool can converge faster and with a wider range of
parameters than previously known under asynchronous iterations. At the same

system and the rate at which SGD can converge, which governs the set of

such as the residual contamination from thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect
in the direction of galaxy clusters, can bias the cross-correlation
measurements between CMB and large-scale structure optical surveys. It is thus
essential to quantify those residuals and, if possible, to null out SZ cluster
residuals in CMB maps. We quantify for the first time the amount of SZ cluster
contamination in the released Planck 2015 CMB maps through (i) the stacking of
CMB maps in the direction of the clusters, and (ii) the computation of
cross-correlation power spectra between CMB maps and the SDSS-IV large-scale
structure data. Our cross-power spectrum analysis yields a $30\sigma$ detection
at the cluster scale ($\ell=1500-2500$) and a $39\sigma$ detection on larger
scales ($\ell=500-1500$) due to clustering of SZ clusters, giving an overall
$54\sigma$ detection of SZ cluster residuals in the Planck CMB maps. The Planck
2015 NILC CMB map is shown to have $44\pm4\%$ of thermal SZ foreground emission
left in it. Using the 'Constrained ILC' component separation technique, we
construct an alternative Planck CMB map, the 2D-ILC map, which is shown to have
negligible SZ contamination, at the cost of being slightly more contaminated by
Galactic foregrounds and noise. We also discuss the impact of the SZ residuals

  controls in presence of noise","50 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1607.07648",,,,"nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The presence of a nonattractive chaotic set, also called chaotic saddle, in
phase space implies the appearance of a finite time kind of chaos that is known
as transient chaos. For a given dynamical system in a certain region of phase
space with transient chaos, trajectories eventually abandon the chaotic region
escaping to an external attractor, if no external intervention is done on the
system. In some situations, this attractor may involve an undesirable behavior,
so the application of a control in the system is necessary to avoid it. Both,
the nonattractive nature of transient chaos and eventually the presence of
noise may hinder this task. Recently, a new method to control chaos called
\emph{partial control} has been developed. The method is based on the existence
of a set, called the safe set, that allows to sustain transient chaos by only
using a small amount of control. The surprising result is that the trajectories
can be controlled by using an amount of control smaller than the amount of
noise affecting it. We present here a broad survey of results of this control
method applied to a wide variety of dynamical systems. We also review here all
the variations of the partial control method that have been developed so far.
In all the cases various systems of different dimensionality are treated in
order to see the potential of this method. We believe that this method is a
step forward in controlling chaos in presence of disturbances.

quantitative explanation about these three different phases of development.
  Keeping up with this Axelrod model, we characterize its culture
configurations space at equilibrium point where $\left\langle
s(t_{\text{eq}})\right\rangle = 1$. This space is called monoculture space.
Understanding this space is equivalent to restrict to the space of culture
configurations from one individual in the model. This individual culture space
is identified to the space $V_N^{\otimes F}$ up to isomorphisms. Action of the
permutation group $S_N$ on the space $V_{N}^{\otimes F}$ is considered. Under
this action, the observable $\left\langle s(t)\right\rangle$ is an invariant of
the Axelrod system. We explore this symmetry and classify the different
inequivalent classes of culture configurations composing the monoculture space.
To achieve this, we consider the case $N\geq F$. We propose techniques from
group representation theory to perform this classification. The inequivalent
classes of culture configurations are indexed by the Dickau diagrams which are
associated to the Bell number $B_F$. A concrete example with $F=4$ and $N\geq

strong and rapid reversible adhesion on multiple types of smooth and

simple method of solution. The solution is expressed in terms of Laplace
Transform of the Green's function for end-to-end motion of the polymer in
absence of the sink. We have used two different rate constants, the long term
rate constant and the average rate constant. The average rate constant and long
term rate constant varies with several parameters such as length of the polymer
(N), bond length (b) and the relaxation time ${\tau_R}$. Our results are in
agreement with that produced by more general and detailed method.

gated recurrent units (GRUs) use ad hoc gating mechanisms. Empirically these
models have been found to improve the learning of medium to long term temporal
dependencies and to help with vanishing gradient issues. We prove that
learnable gates in a recurrent model formally provide quasi- invariance to
general time transformations in the input data. We recover part of the LSTM
architecture from a simple axiomatic approach. This result leads to a new way
of initializing gate biases in LSTMs and GRUs. Ex- perimentally, this new
chrono initialization is shown to greatly improve learning of long term
dependencies, with minimal implementation effort.
