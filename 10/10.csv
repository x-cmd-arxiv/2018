have become usual sense in real-world applications. In this work, an improved
maximum margin criterion (MMC) method is introduced firstly. With the new
definition of MMC, several variants of MMC, including random MMC, layered MMC,
2D^2 MMC, are designed to make adaptive learning applicable. Particularly, the
MMC network is developed to learn deep features of images in light of simple

radio-selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming galaxies (SFGs)
using a multi-resolution catalog based on the original VLA-COSMOS 3\,GHz
0\farcs75 resolution mosaic and its convolved images (up to a resolution of
2\farcs2). The final catalog contains 6\,399 radio sources above a 3\,GHz total
flux density of $S_T>20$ $\mu$Jy (median $<S_T>=37$ $\mu$Jy), with redshift
information (median $<z>=1.0$), and multi-wavelength classification as SFGs,
radio-excess AGN (RX-AGN), or non-radio-excess AGN (NRX-AGN). RX-AGN are those
whose radio emission exceeds the star formation rate derived by fitting the
global spectral energy distribution. We derive the evolution with redshift and
luminosity of the median linear sizes of each class of objects. We find that
RX-AGN are compact, with median sizes of $\sim$ 1-2 kpc and increasing with
redshift, corresponding to an almost constant angular size of 0\farcs25.
NRX-AGN typically have radio sizes a factor of 2 larger than the RX-AGN. The
median radio size of SFGs is about 5 kpc up to $z\sim 0.7$, and it decreases
beyond this redshift. Using luminosity-complete subsamples of objects, we
separately investigate the effect of redshift and luminosity dependance. We
compare the radio sizes of SFGs with those derived in the rest-frame
far-infrared (FIR) and UV bands. We find that SFGs have comparable sizes
(within 15\%) in the radio and rest-frame FIR, while the sizes measured in the
UV-band are systematically larger than the radio sizes.

target are investigated in an effective Lagrangian approach. Two treatments of
the $t$-channel Born term, the Feynman model and the Regge model, are
introduced to calculate the total and differential cross sections of the
$\pi^{-}p\rightarrow f_{1}(1420)n$ and $K^{-}p\rightarrow f_{1}(1420)\Lambda $
reactions. The numerical results indicate that the experimental data of the
total cross section of the $\pi ^{-}p\rightarrow f_{1}(1420)n$ reaction can be
reproduced in both the Feynman and the Regge models. Based on the parameters
determined in the pion induced reaction, the cross sections of the
$K^{-}p\rightarrow f_{1}(1420)\Lambda $ reaction, about which there is little
data found in the literature, are predicted in the same beam momentum range. It
is found that the line shapes of the total cross section obtained in a kaon
induced reaction with two treatments are quite different. The cross sections
for both reactions are at an order of magnitude of $\mu$b, or larger, at a beam
momenta up to 10 GeV/c. The differential cross sections for both pion and kaon
induced reactions are also present. It is found that in the Regge model, the
$t$ channel provides a sharp increase at extreme forward angles. The results
suggest that the experimental study of the $f_1(1420)$ in the kaon induced
reaction on a proton target is as promising as in the pion induced reaction.
Such an experimental measurement is also very helpful to clarify the production
mechanism of the $f_1(1420)$.

great threat to the wind power production stability, and to the wind turbines
themselves. Lately, much work has been done on developing models to forecast

models to accurately forecast extreme wind speeds, which can damage the

model to forecast extreme and non-extreme wind speeds simultaneously. Our model
belongs to the class of latent Gaussian models, for which inference is
conveniently performed based on the integrated nested Laplace approximation
method. Considering a flexible additive regression structure, we propose two
models for the latent linear predictor to capture the spatio-temporal dynamics
of wind speeds. Our models are fast to fit and can describe both the bulk and
the tail of the wind speed distribution while producing short-term extreme and
non-extreme wind speed probabilistic forecasts.

in the generation of large quantities of data at unprecedented rates.
Unfortunately, most of the generated data is wasted without extracting
potentially useful information and knowledge because of the lack of established
mechanisms and standards that benefit from the availability of such data.
Moreover, the high dynamical nature of smart cities calls for new generation of
machine learning approaches that are flexible and adaptable to cope with the
dynamicity of data to perform analytics and learn from real-time data. In this
article, we shed the light on the challenge of under utilizing the big data
generated by smart cities from a machine learning perspective. Especially, we
present the phenomenon of wasting unlabeled data. We argue that
semi-supervision is a must for smart city to address this challenge. We also
propose a three-level learning framework for smart cities that matches the
hierarchical nature of big data generated by smart cities with a goal of
providing different levels of knowledge abstractions. The proposed framework is
scalable to meet the needs of smart city services. Fundamentally, the framework
benefits from semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning where a small amount
of data that has users' feedback serves as labeled data while a larger amount
is without such users' feedback serves as unlabeled data. This paper also
explores how deep reinforcement learning and its shift toward semi-supervision
can handle the cognitive side of smart city services and improve their
performance by providing several use cases spanning the different domains of
smart cities. We also highlight several challenges as well as promising future
research directions for incorporating machine learning and high-level

accurately detect abnormal condition of aerators in time. Surveillance cameras
are widely used as visual perception modules of the Internet of Things, and
then using these widely existing surveillance cameras to realize real-time
anomaly detection of aerators is a cost-free and easy-to-promote method.
However, it is difficult to develop such an expert system due to some technical

To tackle these aforementioned challenges, we propose a real-time expert system
based on computer vision technology and existing surveillance cameras for
anomaly detection of aerators, which consists of two modules, i.e., object
region detection and working state detection. First, it is difficult to detect
the working state for some small object regions in whole images, and the time
complexity of global feature comparison is also high, so we present an object
region detection method based on the region proposal idea. Moreover, we propose
a novel algorithm called reference frame Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (RF-KLT) algorithm
for motion feature extraction in fixed regions. Then, we present a dimension
reduction method of time series for establishing a feature dataset with obvious
boundaries between classes. Finally, we use machine learning algorithms to
build the feature classifier. The experimental results in both the actual video

object region and working state of aerators is 100% and 99.9% respectively, and
the detection speed is 77-333 frames per second (FPS) according to the
different types of surveillance cameras.

Bostan, Chyzak, and Mahboubi has given a bijection for models using small
north, west, and south-east steps. We adapt and generalize it to a bijection
between half-plane walks using those three steps in two colours and a
quarter-plane model over the symmetrized step set consisting of north,
north-west, west, south, south-east, and east. We then generalize our
bijections to certain models with large steps: for given $p\geq1$, a bijection
is given between the half-plane and quarter-plane models obtained by keeping
the small south-east step and replacing the two steps north and west of length
1 by the $p+1$ steps of length $p$ in directions between north and west. This
model is close to, but distinct from, the model of generalized tandem walks
studied by Bousquet-M\'elou, Fusy, and Raschel.

alternative ways that incorporate unlabeled data as well. In recent years, Deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained great success in several application
domains. It is an applicable method for IoT and smart city scenarios where
auto-generated data can be partially labeled by users' feedback for training
purposes. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised deep reinforcement
learning model that fits smart city applications as it consumes both labeled
and unlabeled data to improve the performance and accuracy of the learning
agent. The model utilizes Variational Autoencoders (VAE) as the inference
engine for generalizing optimal policies. To the best of our knowledge, the
proposed model is the first investigation that extends deep reinforcement
learning to the semi-supervised paradigm. As a case study of smart city
applications, we focus on smart buildings and apply the proposed model to the
problem of indoor localization based on BLE signal strength. Indoor
localization is the main component of smart city services since people spend
significant time in indoor environments. Our model learns the best action
policies that lead to a close estimation of the target locations with an
improvement of 23% in terms of distance to the target and at least 67% more

[Kouveliotou:93], GRBs have most often been classified into two populations:
""short bursts"" (shorter than 2.0 seconds) and ""long bursts"" (longer than 2.0
seconds). However, recent works have suggested the existence of an intermediate
population in the bursts observed by the Swift satellite. Moreover, some
researchers have questioned the universality of the 2.0-second dividing line
between short and long bursts: some bursts may be short but actually result
from collapsars, the physical mechanism behind normally long bursts, and some
long ones may originate from mergers, the usual progenitors of short GRBs. In
this work, we focus on GRBs detected by the Fermi satellite and study the
distribution of their durations measured in the observer's reference frame and,
for those with known redshifts, in the bursts' reference frames. However, there
are relatively few bursts with measured redshifts, and this makes an accurate
study difficult. To overcome this problem, we follow [Zhang:2018] and determine
a ""pseudo-redshift"" from the correlation relation between the luminosity $L_p$
and the energy $E_p$, both of which are calculated at the peak of the flux.
Interestingly, we find that the uncertainties in the quantities observed and
used in the determination of pseudo-redshifts, do affect the precision of the
individual results significantly, but they keep the distribution of
pseudo-redshifts very similar to that of the actual ones and thus allow us to
use pseudo-redshifts for our statistical study. We use the reduced chi-square
and the maximization of the log-likelihood to statistically analyze the
distribution of Fermi GRB durations. Both methods show that the distribution of
the observed and the intrinsic bursts durations are better represented by two
groups, rather than three.

particles is an adiabatic invariant. An increase in the magnetic-field strength
in such a plasma thus leads to an increase in the thermal pressure
perpendicular to the field lines. Above a $\beta$-dependent threshold (where
$\beta$ is the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure), this pressure anisotropy
drives the mirror instability, producing strong distortions in the field lines
on ion-Larmor scales. The impact of this instability on magnetic reconnection
is investigated using a simple analytical model for the formation of a current
sheet (CS) and the associated production of pressure anisotropy. The difficulty
in maintaining an isotropic, Maxwellian particle distribution during the
formation and subsequent thinning of a CS in a collisionless plasma, coupled
with the low threshold for the mirror instability in a high-$\beta$ plasma,
imply that the geometry of reconnecting magnetic fields can differ radically
from the standard Harris-sheet profile often used in simulations of
collisionless reconnection. As a result, depending on the rate of CS formation
and the initial CS thickness, tearing modes whose growth rates and wavenumbers
are boosted by this difference may disrupt the mirror-infested CS before
standard tearing modes can develop. A quantitative theory is developed to
illustrate this process, which may find application in the tearing-mediated
disruption of kinetic magnetorotational ""channel"" modes.

the torque is not attenuated as strongly as in the case of pure Fe. Moreover,
in FePt the torque alternates sign at the Fe and Pt atomic planes throughout
the stack for all FePt thicknesses considered. Finally, when Fe is intercalated
between MgO and L$1_0$-FePt, the torque is sharply attenuated and it is
transferred to FePt only for a Fe seed layer that is less than
two-atomic-planes thick. We attribute these features to the different spatial
profiles of the exchange and correlation field and the induced non-equilibrium
spin accumulation. The calculated tunnelling magneto-resistance of the
Fe/MgO/FePt/Fe junctions studied is enhanced with respect to the one of
Fe/MgO/Fe, while it is reduced with Fe intercalation. Our work shows that

showing that magnetic reconnection is a promising alternative mechanism. Here,
we present a macroscopic emission model physically motivated by PIC
simulations, where the energy for particle acceleration originates from the
reconnecting magnetic field. We track the radial growth and relative velocity
of a reconnecting plasmoid, modelling particle acceleration and radiative
losses from synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission. To test
the viability of magnetic reconnection as the mechanism behind rapid blazar
flares we simultaneously fit our model to the observed light-curve and SED from
the 2016 TeV flare of BL Lacertae. We find generally that, without considering
external photons, reconnecting plasmoids are unable to produce Compton-dominant
TeV flares and so cannot reproduce the observations due to overproduction of
synchrotron emission. Additionally, problematically large plasmoids, comparable
in size to the entire jet radius, are required to emit sufficient SSC
gamma-rays to be observable. However, our plasmoid model can reproduce the
rapid TeV lightcurve of the flare, demonstrating that reconnection is able to
produce rapid, powerful TeV flares on observed timescales. We conclude that
while reconnection can produce SSC flares on the correct timescales, the
primary source of TeV emission cannot be SSC and the size of plasmoids required
may be implausibly large.

probability model from the data are Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and
Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs). VAEs consider an explicit probability model
for the data and compute a generative distribution by maximizing a variational
lower-bound on the log-likelihood function. GANs, however, compute a generative
model by minimizing a distance between observed and generated probability
distributions without considering an explicit model for the observed data. The
lack of having explicit probability models in GANs prohibits computation of
sample likelihoods in their frameworks and limits their use in statistical
inference problems. In this work, we resolve this issue by constructing an
explicit probability model that can be used to compute sample likelihood
statistics in GANs. In particular, we prove that under this probability model,
a family of Wasserstein GANs with an entropy regularization can be viewed as a
generative model that maximizes a variational lower-bound on average sample log
likelihoods, an approach that VAEs are based on. This result makes a principled
connection between two modern generative models, namely GANs and VAEs. In
addition to the aforementioned theoretical results, we compute likelihood

scalable learning algorithms introduced by (Kingma & Welling, 2013; Rezende et
al., 2014). These approaches maximize a variational lower bound on the
intractable log likelihood of the observed data. Burda et al. (2015) introduced
a multi-sample variational bound, IWAE, that is at least as tight as the
standard variational lower bound and becomes increasingly tight as the number
of samples increases. Counterintuitively, the typical inference network
gradient estimator for the IWAE bound performs poorly as the number of samples
increases (Rainforth et al., 2018; Le et al., 2018). Roeder et al. (2017)
propose an improved gradient estimator, however, are unable to show it is
unbiased. We show that it is in fact biased and that the bias can be estimated
efficiently with a second application of the reparameterization trick. The
doubly reparameterized gradient (DReG) estimator does not suffer as the number
of samples increases, resolving the previously raised issues. The same idea can
be used to improve many recently introduced training techniques for latent
variable models. In particular, we show that this estimator reduces the
variance of the IWAE gradient, the reweighted wake-sleep update (RWS)
(Bornschein & Bengio, 2014), and the jackknife variational inference (JVI)
gradient (Nowozin, 2018). Finally, we show that this computationally efficient,
unbiased drop-in gradient estimator translates to improved performance for all

arising question is how to describe time evolution relative to quantum clocks
and, specifically, how the dynamics relative to different quantum clocks are
related. This is a pressing issue in view of the multiple choice problem of
time in quantum gravity, which posits that there is no distinguished choice of
internal clock in generic general relativistic systems and that different
choices lead to inequivalent quantum theories. Exploiting a recent approach to
switching quantum reference systems (arXiv:1809.00556, arXiv:1809:05093), we
exhibit a systematic method for switching between different clock choices in
the quantum theory. We illustrate it by means of the parametrized particle,
which, like gravity, features a Hamiltonian constraint. We explicitly switch
between the quantum evolution relative to the non-relativistic time variable
and that relative to the particle's position, which requires carefully
regularizing the zero-modes in the so-called time-of-arrival observable. While
this toy model is simple, our approach is general and directly amenable to
quantum cosmology. It proceeds by systematically linking the reduced quantum
theories relative to different clock choices via the clock-choice-neutral Dirac
quantized theory, in analogy to coordinate changes on a manifold. This method
suggests a new perspective on the multiple choice problem, indicating that it
is rather a multiple choice feature of a complete relational quantum theory,
taken as the conjunction of Dirac quantized and quantum deparametrized
theories. Precisely this conjunction permits one to consistently switch between
different temporal reference systems which is a prerequisite for a quantum
notion of general covariance. Finally, we show that quantum uncertainties lead
to discontinuity in the relational dynamics when switching clocks.

loss of some elements at temperatures as low as 500 K. This work builds on
previous laboratory heating experiments on primitive meteorites and shows the
sensitivity of chondrite compositions to excursions in temperature. Elements

essential for quantifying elemental fractionation that occurred on asteroids
early in Solar System history. This work is relevant to maintaining a pristine

5.5 years. The primary star features the densest known stellar wind, colliding
with that expelled by its companion. The wind collision region dissipates
energy and accelerate particles up to relativistic energies, producing non
thermal X- and $\gamma$-ray emission detected by Beppo-SAX, INTEGRAL, Swift,
Suzaku, Agile, Fermi and H.E.S.S.. The orbital variability of the system
provides key diagnostic on the physics involved and on the emission mechanisms.
The low-energy component, which cuts off below 10 GeV and varies by a factor <
2 along the orbit, is likely of inverse Compton origin. The high energy
component varies by larger factors and differently during the two periastrons
observed by Fermi. These variations match the predictions of simula- tions
assuming a magnetic field in the range 0.4-1 kG at the surface of the primary
star. The high-energy component and the thermal X-ray emission were weaker than
expected around the 2014 periastron suggesting a modification of the inner wind
density. Diffuse shock acceleration in the complex geometry of the wind
collision zone provides a convincing match to the observations and new
diagnostic tools to probe the geometry and energetics of the system. A future
instrument sensitive in the MeV energy range could discriminate between
lepto-hadronic and hadronic models for the gamma-ray emission. At higher
energies, the Cherenkov Telescope Array will distinguish orbital modulations of
the high-energy component from these of ultraviolet-TeV photo absorption
providing a wealth of information constraining acceleration physics in more
extreme conditions than found in SNR.

and the luminosity function of active galactic nuclei (AGN), we explore a
co-evolution scenario in which AGN are associated only with the very last
phases of the star-forming life of a galaxy. We derive analytically the
connections between the parameters of the observed quasar luminosity functions
and galaxy mass functions. The $(m_{\rm bh}/m_{*})_{Qing}$ associated with
quenching is given by the ratio of the global black hole accretion rate density
(BHARD) and star-formation rate density (SFRD) at the epoch in question.
Observational data on the SFRD and BHARD suggests $(m_{\rm bh}/m_{*})_{Qing}
\propto (1+z)^{1.5}$ below redshift 2. This evolution reproduces the observed
mass-luminosity plane of SDSS quasars, and also reproduces the local $m_{\rm
bh}/m_{*}$ relation in passive galaxies. The characteristic Eddington ratio,
$\lambda^*$, is derived from both the BHARD/SFRD ratio and the evolving $L^*$
of the AGN population. This increases up to $z \sim 2$ as $\lambda^* \propto
(1+z)^{2.5}$ but at higher redshifts, $\lambda^*$ stabilizes at the physically
interesting Eddington limit, $\lambda^* \sim 1$. The new model may be thought
of as an opposite extreme to our earlier co-evolution scenario in Caplar et al.
2015. The main observable difference between the two co-evolution scenarios,
presented here and in Caplar et al. 2015, is in the active fraction of low mass
star-forming galaxies. We compare the predictions with the data from deep
multi-wavelength surveys and find that the ""quenching"" scenario developed in

understanding the dynamics and thermodynamics of the intracluster medium (ICM)
within the cores of galaxy clusters. While radio bubbles inflated by AGN jets
could be dynamically supported by cosmic rays (CRs), the impact of CR-dominated
jets are not well understood. In this work, we perform three-dimensional
simulations of CR-jet feedback in an isolated cluster atmosphere; we find that
CR jets impact the multiphase gas differently than jets dominated by kinetic
energy. In particular, CR bubbles can more efficiently uplift the cluster gas
and cause an outward expansion of the hot ICM. Due to adiabatic cooling from
the expansion and less efficient heating from CR bubbles by direct mixing, the
ICM is more prone to local thermal instabilities, which will later enhance
chaotic cold accretion onto the AGN. The amount of cold gas formed during the
bubble formation and its late-time evolution sensitively depend on whether CR
transport processes are included or not. We also find that low-level, subsonic
driving of turbulence by AGN jets holds for both kinetic and CR jets;
nevertheless, the kinematics is consistent with the Hitomi measurements.
Finally, we carefully discuss the key observable signatures of each bubble
model, focusing on gamma-ray emission (and related comparison with Fermi), as

thermal machines have been linked to the buildup of coherences in a preferred
basis. But, is this connection always an evidence of `quantum-thermodynamic
supremacy'? By force of example, we show that this is not the case. In
particular, we compare a power-driven three-level continuous quantum
refrigerator with a four-level combined cycle, partly driven by power and
partly by heat. We focus on the weak driving regime and find the four-level
model to be superior since it can operate in parameter regimes in which the
three-level model cannot, it may exhibit a larger cooling rate, and,
simultaneously, a better coefficient of performance. Furthermore, we find that
the improvement in the cooling rate matches the increase in the stationary
quantum coherences exactly. Crucially, though, we also show that the
thermodynamic variables for both models follow from a classical representation
based on graph theory. This implies that we can build incoherent
stochastic-thermodynamic models with the same steady-state operation or,
equivalently, that both coherent refrigerators can be emulated classically.
More generally, we prove this for any N-level weakly driven device with a
`cyclic' pattern of transitions. Therefore, even if coherence is present in a
specific quantum thermal machine, it is often not essential to replicate the
underlying energy conversion process.

consequences: The equatorial current sheet is truncated to a finite length, the
fraction of field lines that are open increases, and the open field lines are
confined within a cylindrical surface instead of becoming radial. A strong
external magnetic field antiparallel to the dipole allows for solutions where
the pulsar magnetic field is fully enclosed within an ellipsoidal surface.
Configurations of fully enclosed or confined magnetospheres may appear in a
double neutron star (DNS) where one of the components is a slowly rotating,
strongly magnetised pulsar and the other a weakly magnetised millisecond
pulsar. Depending on the geometry, twisted field lines from the millisecond
pulsar could form an asymmetric wind. More dramatic consequences could appear
closer to merger: there, the neutron star with the weaker magnetic field may
undergo a stage where it alternates between an open and a fully enclosed
magnetosphere releasing up $10^{38}$erg. Under favourable combinations of
magnetic fields DNSs can spend up to 10$^3$ yr in the coupled phase, implying a
Galactic population of $0.02$ systems. Potential observational signatures of

formation, as inferred from its H$\alpha$ emission. However, a more recent work
casts doubts on the planetary nature of the previous detections. We have
observed LkCa 15 with ISIS/WHT. The spectrograph's slit was oriented towards
the last reported position of LkCa 15 b (parallel direction) and 90degr from
that (perpendicular). The photocenter and full width half maximum (FWHM) of the
Gaussians fitting the spatial distribution at H$\alpha$ and the adjacent
continuum were measured. A well-known binary (GU CMa) was used as a calibrator
to test the spectro-astrometric performance of ISIS/WHT, recovering consistent
photocenter and FWHM signals. However, the photocenter shift predicted for LkCa
15 b is not detected, but the FWHM in H$\alpha$ is broader than in the
continuum for both slit positions. Our simulations show that the photocenter
and FWHM observations cannot be explained simultaneously by an accreting
planet. In turn, both spectro-astrometric observations are naturally reproduced
from a roughly symmetric Halpha emitting region centered on the star and extent
comparable to the orbit originally attributed to the planet at several au. The
extended H$\alpha$ emission around LkCa 15 could be related to a variable disk
wind, but additional multi-epoch data and detailed modeling are necessary to
understand its physical nature. Spectro-astrometry in H$\alpha$ is able to test

$h_c(f=1/{\rm yr})=10^{-17}$, our current understanding of galaxy and SMBHB
mergers is disfavoured at a $5\sigma$ level, indicating a combination of severe
binary stalling, over-estimating of the SMBH -- host galaxy relations, and
extreme dynamical properties of merging SMBHBs. Conversely, future detections
of a Square Kilometre Array (SKA)-type array will allow to constrain the
normalization of the SMBHB merger rate in the Universe, the time between galaxy
pairing and SMBHB merging, the normalization of the SMBH -- host galaxy
relations and the dynamical binary properties, including their eccentricity and
density of stellar environment.

deformations, as was discussed by Callan and Wilczek, and provide an
interesting two-parameter family of quantities which interpolate between the
S-matrices in flat space and the correlators in CFT with a boundary. For the
actual computation, we judiciously use the spectral representation to resum
loop diagrams in the bulk. After the resummation, the AdS $4$-particle
scattering amplitude is given in terms of a single unknown function of the
spectral parameter. We then ""bootstrap"" the unknown function by requiring the
absence of double-trace operators in the boundary OPE. Our results are at
leading nontrivial order in $\frac{1}{N}$, and include the full dependence on
the quartic coupling, the mass parameters, and the AdS radius. In the bosonic
$O(N)$ model we study both the massive phase and the symmetry-breaking phase,
which exists even in AdS$_2$ evading Coleman's theorem, and identify the AdS
analogue of a resonance in flat space. We then propose that symmetry breaking
in AdS implies the existence of a conformal manifold in the boundary conformal
theory. We also provide evidence for the existence of a critical point with
bulk conformal symmetry, matching existing results and finding new ones for the
conformal boundary conditions of the critical theories. For the Gross-Neveu
model we find a bound state, which interpolates between the familiar bound
state in flat space and the displacement operator at the critical point.

simulated with the EAGLE model of galaxy formation. As in earlier work, we find
that the star formation (SF) gas density threshold ($\rho_{\rm th}$) plays a
critical role. At low thresholds (LT), gas is unable to reach densities high
enough to dominate the gravitational potential before being dispersed by
feedback from supernovae. LT runs show little effect on the inner DM profile,
even in systems with extended and bursty SF, two ingredients often cited as
critical for core formation. For higher thresholds, gas is able to dominate the
gravitational potential before being ejected by feedback. This can lead to a
substantial reduction in the inner DM content, but only if the gas is
gravitationally important over an extended period of time, allowing the halo to
contract before gas removal. Rapid assembly and removal of gas in short SF
bursts is less effective at altering the inner DM content. Subsequent gas
accretion may draw DM back in and reform a cusp, unless SF is bursty enough to
prevent it, preserving the core. Thus, for the EAGLE SF+feedback model, there
is no simple relation between core formation and SF history, contrary to recent
claims. The dependence of the inner DM content of dwarfs on $\rho_{\rm th}$
hinders robust predictions and the interpretation of observations. A simulation
of a $(12 \rm \ Mpc)^3$ volume with high $\rho_{\rm th}$ results in dwarfs with
sizeable cores over a limited halo mass range, but with insufficient variety in
mass profiles to explain the observed diversity of dwarf galaxy rotation
curves.

cluster medium on the interstellar gas of various phases. In this Letter, we
present the high-resolution 12CO(1-0) and 13CO(1-0) data of NGC 4522 obtained

we report here the extraplanar 13CO detection that has never before been seen

atomic form or as molecules, this study provides evidence for the ram pressure
stripping of heavy elements, which can chemically enrich the halo gas, and
potentially the intracluster medium, in the case that they are pushed strongly

CSP means that the input contains the domain and the list of tuples of each

homomorphism problem and also to evaluation of conjunctive queries on

  We do not restrict the problem to any (finite or infinite) family of
relations. Marx and Bulatov (2014) showed that Uniform CSP restricted to some
finite family of relations (thus with a bound on the arity of relations) and
over any finite domain is either W[1]-complete or fixed parameter tractable.

shorter and arguably more intuitive.
  Lastly, we study the weighted CSP over the Boolean Domain, where each
variable is assigned a weight, and given a target value, it should be decided
if there is a satisfying assignment of size $k$ (the parameter) such that the
weight of its $1$-variables adds up to the target value. We prove that if the
weights are bounded by $n^k$, then the problem is in W[1]. Our proofs give a

Eridani itself, we consider two possible models: 1) cosmic-ray collisions with
solid bodies in the debris disk which extends out $\sim$60 AU from the host

a total disk mass consistent with infrared measurements, we find that the size

prohibitive near-wall resolution requirements in high-Reynolds-number turbulent
flows. Most existing wall models rely on assumptions about the state of the
boundary layer and require a priori prescription of tunable coefficients. They
also impose the predicted wall stress by replacing the no-slip boundary
condition at the wall with a Neumann boundary condition in the wall-parallel
directions while maintaining the no-transpiration condition in the wall-normal
direction. In the present study, we first motivate and analyse the Robin (slip)
boundary condition with transpiration (nonzero wall-normal velocity) in the
context of wall-modelled LES. The effect of the slip boundary condition on the
one-point statistics of the flow is investigated in LES of turbulent channel
flow and flat-plate turbulent boundary layer. It is shown that the slip
condition provides a framework to compensate for the deficit or excess of mean
momentum at the wall. Moreover, the resulting nonzero stress at the wall
alleviates the well-known problem of the wall-stress under-estimation by
current subgrid-scale (SGS) models. Secondly, we discuss the requirements for
the slip condition to be used in conjunction with wall models and derive the
equation that connects the slip boundary condition with the stress at the wall.
Finally, a dynamic procedure for the slip coefficients is formulated, providing
a dynamic slip wall model free of a priori specified coefficients. The
performance of the proposed dynamic wall model is tested in a series of LES of
turbulent channel flow, non-equilibrium three-dimensional channel flow, and
flat-plate turbulent boundary layer. The results show that the dynamic wall
model is able to accurately predict one-point turbulence statistics for various
flow configurations, Reynolds numbers, and grid resolutions.

for the analysis of the planar Navier-Stokes (NS) equations either in vorticity

possibly multiply connected domain. The velocity field satisfies either
homogeneous (no-slip boundary conditions) or prescribed Dirichlet boundary
conditions. We prove that the analysis of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations can be
carried out in terms of the so-called nonprimitive variables only (vorticity
field and stream function) without resorting to the classical NS theory (stated
in primitive variables, i.e. velocity and pressure fields). Both approaches (in
primitive and nonprimitive variables) are shown to be equivalent for weak
(Leray) and strong (Kato) solutions. Explicit Bernoulli-like formulas are
derived and allow recovering the pressure field from the vorticity fields or
the stream function. In the last section, the functional framework described
earlier leads to a simplified rephrasing of the vorticity dynamics, as
introduced by Maekawa in [52]. At this level of regularity, the vorticity
equation splits into a coupling between a parabolic and an elliptic equation
corresponding respectively to the non-harmonic and harmonic parts of the
vorticity equation. By exploiting this structure it is possible to prove new
existence and uniqueness results, as well as the exponential decay of the
palinstrophy (that is, loosely speaking, the $H^1$ norm of the vorticity) for
large time, an estimate which was not known so far.

electrophysiology data using machine learning and predictive modelling. Cardiac
arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation, are a major global healthcare
challenge. Treatment is often through catheter ablation, which involves the
targeted localized destruction of regions of the myocardium responsible for
initiating or perpetuating the arrhythmia. Ablation targets are either
anatomically defined, or identified based on their functional properties as
determined through the analysis of contact intracardiac electrograms acquired
with increasing spatial density by modern electroanatomic mapping systems.
While numerous quantitative approaches have been investigated over the past
decades for identifying these critical curative sites, few have provided a
reliable and reproducible advance in success rates. Machine learning
techniques, including recent deep-learning approaches, offer a potential route
to gaining new insight from this wealth of highly complex spatio-temporal
information that existing methods struggle to analyse. Coupled with predictive
modelling, these techniques offer exciting opportunities to advance the field
and produce more accurate diagnoses and robust personalised treatment. We
outline some of these methods and illustrate their use in making predictions
from the contact electrogram and augmenting predictive modelling tools, both by
more rapidly predicting future states of the system and by inferring the
parameters of these models from experimental observations.

However, despite the great potential, no prior research has pointed out how to
craft an sparse kernel design with such potential (i.e., effective design), and
all prior works just adopt simple combinations of existing sparse kernels such
as group convolution. Meanwhile due to the large design space it is also
impossible to try all combinations of existing sparse kernels. In this paper,
we are the first in the field to consider how to craft an effective sparse
kernel design by eliminating the large design space. Specifically, we present a
sparse kernel scheme to illustrate how to reduce the space from three aspects.
First, in terms of composition we remove designs composed of repeated layers.
Second, to remove designs with large accuracy degradation, we find an unified
property named information field behind various sparse kernel designs, which
could directly indicate the final accuracy. Last, we remove designs in two
cases where a better parameter efficiency could be achieved. Additionally, we
provide detailed efficiency analysis on the final four designs in our scheme.
Experimental results validate the idea of our scheme by showing that our scheme
is able to find designs which are more efficient in using parameters and

  circuits","36 pages, 2 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The generation of certifiable randomness is the most fundamental
information-theoretic task that meaningfully separates quantum devices from
their classical counterparts. We propose a protocol for exponential certified
randomness expansion using a single quantum device. The protocol calls for the
device to implement a simple quantum circuit of constant depth on a 2D lattice
of qubits. The output of the circuit can be verified classically in linear
time, and is guaranteed to contain a polynomial number of certified random bits
assuming that the device used to generate the output operated using a
(classical or quantum) circuit of sub-logarithmic depth. This assumption
contrasts with the locality assumption used for randomness certification based
on Bell inequality violation or computational assumptions. To demonstrate
randomness generation it is sufficient for a device to sample from the ideal
output distribution within constant statistical distance.
  Our procedure is inspired by recent work of Bravyi et al. (Science 2018), who
introduced a relational problem that can be solved by a constant-depth quantum
circuit, but provably cannot be solved by any classical circuit of
sub-logarithmic depth. We develop the discovery of Bravyi et al. into a
framework for robust randomness expansion. Our proposal does not rest on any
complexity-theoretic conjectures, but relies on the physical assumption that
the adversarial device being tested implements a circuit of sub-logarithmic
depth. Success on our task can be easily verified in classical linear time.
Finally, our task is more noise-tolerant than most other existing proposals
that can only tolerate multiplicative error, or require additional conjectures
from complexity theory; in contrast, we are able to allow a small constant
additive error in total variation distance between the sampled and ideal

high dimensions. Different from various types of ensemble Kalman filters

advantages. The error covariance has full rank without being limited by a set
of ensembles. In addition to the estimated states, the algorithms provide
updated error covariance for the next assimilation cycle. The sparsity of error
covariance significantly reduces the required memory size for the numerical
computation. In addition, the granularity of the sparse error covariance can be
adjusted to optimize the parallelization of the algorithms.

help expand the scope of hot-carrier optoelectronics beyond hot-electron-based

plasmon-induced hot-hole injection from gold (Au) nanoparticles into the
valence band of p-type gallium nitride (p-GaN) occurs within 200 fs, placing
hot-hole transfer on a similar timescale as hot-electron transfer. We further
observed that the removal of hot holes from below the Au Fermi level exerts a
discernible influence on the thermalization of hot electrons above it, reducing
the peak electronic temperature and decreasing the electron-phonon coupling
time relative to Au samples without a pathway for hot-hole collection. First
principles calculations corroborate these experimental observations, suggesting
that hot-hole injection modifies the relaxation dynamics of hot electrons in Au
nanoparticles through ultrafast modulation of the d-band electronic structure.
Taken together, these ultrafast studies substantially advance our understanding

dominate the literature and report the most competitive performances. These
models learn a deep discriminative neural network classifier in which the
labels are latent. Typically, they use multinomial logistic regression
posteriors and parameter regularization, as is very common in supervised
learning. It is generally acknowledged that discriminative objective functions
(e.g., those based on the mutual information or the KL divergence) are more
flexible than generative approaches (e.g., K-means) in the sense that they make
fewer assumptions about the data distributions and, typically, yield much
better unsupervised deep learning results. On the surface, several recent
discriminative models may seem unrelated to K-means. This study shows that
these models are, in fact, equivalent to K-means under mild conditions and
common posterior models and parameter regularization. We prove that, for the
commonly used logistic regression posteriors, maximizing the $L_2$ regularized
mutual information via an approximate alternating direction method (ADM) is
equivalent to a soft and regularized K-means loss. Our theoretical analysis not
only connects directly several recent state-of-the-art discriminative models to

The new procedure is based on minimizing the $\ell_0$ norm of the vector of
indicator variables that represent if a feature is selected or not. Our
approach relies on the continuous relaxation of Bernoulli distributions, which
allows our model to learn the parameters of the approximate Bernoulli
distributions via gradient descent. This general framework simultaneously
minimizes a loss function while selecting relevant features. Furthermore, we
provide an information-theoretic justification of incorporating Bernoulli
distribution into our approach and demonstrate the potential of the approach on

insight is to begin with a large set of random features, then reduce them to a
small number of weighted features in a data-dependent, computationally

nucleus-emitting-sources give rise to a cepa stratis (onion-like) structure
with layers that become more distant from the source position with rising
energy. The peculiar shape of the hot spots from nucleus-accelerators is
steered by the competition between energy loss during propagation and
deflection on the Galactic magnetic field (GMF). Here, we run a full-blown
simulation study to accurately characterize the deflections of UHECR nuclei in
the GMF. We show that while the cepa stratis structure provides a global
description of anisotropy patterns produced by UHECR nuclei en route to Earth,
the hot spots are elongated depending on their location in the sky due to the
regular structure of the GMF. We demonstrate that with a high-statistics sample
at the high-energy-end of the spectrum, like the one to be collected by NASA's
POEMMA mission, the energy dependence of the hot-spot contours could become a
useful observable to identify the nuclear composition of UHECRs. This new

those using observables of extensive air showers, and therefore is unaffected

physical properties, which can be fully revealed only by spatially resolved

by microwave impedance microscopy first appears along the hetero-interface and
bilayer edge, then along the monolayer edge, inside the bilayer area, and
finally in the interior of the monolayer region. The sequential emergence of
mobile carriers in different sections of the sample is consistent with the
theoretical calculation of local energy gaps. Quantitative analysis of the
microscopy and transport data also reveals the linear dependence of
photoconductivity on the laser intensity and the influence of interlayer

we propose a data-driven tech-nique using a neural network design which
exploits two categories of data. First, training data were acquired on three
squirrel monkey brains using ex-vivo DW-MRI and histology of the brain. Second,
repeated scans of human subjects were acquired on two different scanners to
augment the learning of the network pro-posed. To use these data, we propose a
new network architecture, the null space deep network (NSDN), to simultaneously
learn on traditional observed/truth pairs (e.g., MRI-histology voxels) along
with repeated observations without a known truth (e.g., scan-rescan MRI). The
NSDN was tested on twenty percent of the histology voxels that were kept
completely blind to the network. NSDN significantly improved absolute
performance relative to histology by 3.87% over CSD and 1.42% over a recently
proposed deep neural network approach. More-over, it improved reproducibility
on the paired data by 21.19% over CSD and 10.09% over a recently proposed deep

10.41% over a recently proposed deep learn-ing approach. This work suggests
that data-driven approaches for local fiber re-construction are more
reproducible, informative and precise and offers a novel, practical method for

stringent requirement of the mono-hydrogenated zigzag edge. Using
first-principle calculations, we predict that free-carrier doping can overcome
this challenge and realize ferromagnetism and half-metallicity in narrow

within the density range of gate-doping experiments (~1013 cm-2) and has large

continuity of the modeled phenomena. The method extends the given spatial model
with a set of wrapped dimensions that represent the periodicities of observed

a model that allows us to predict future states of both discrete and continuous

and we show the potential implications of this for demonstrating the importance
of savings for buffering an economy during the period of an epidemic.
  Finding an explicit function that relates poverty and the production of a
community is an almost impossible task because of the number of variables and
parameters that should be taken into account. However, studying the dynamics of
an endemic disease in a region that affects its population, and therefore its
ability to work, is an honest approach to understanding this function. We
propose a model, perhaps the simplest, that couples two dynamics, the dynamics
of an endemic disease and the dynamics of a closed economy of products and
goods that the community produces in the epidemic period.
  Some of the results of this study are expected and known in the literature
but some others are not. We highlight three of them: the interdependence that
exists between health and the product of that economy. The majority of the
known results only show the dependence in a single direction. Another of the
most important goals in this work is to show the existence of a poverty
Malthusian trap in economies with low levels of capital investment due to
pandemic disease. And another is to show that there is an optimal level of
savings that maximizes the \emph{per capita} product of the economy, which is
Machiavellian, but has important implications for market efficiency. The model
tells us why saving is important in an aggregate economy despite being affected
by an epidemic.

condition) converge to capacity at block lengths polynomial in the gap to
capacity, while simultaneously achieving failure probabilities that are
exponentially small in the block length (i.e., decoding fails with probability
$\exp(-N^{\Omega(1)})$ for codes of length $N$). Previously this combination
was known only for one specific family within the class of polar codes, whereas
we establish this whenever the polar code exhibits a condition necessary for
any polarization. Our results adapt and strengthen a local analysis of polar
codes due to the authors with Nakkiran and Rudra [Proc. STOC 2018]. Their
analysis related the time-local behavior of a martingale to its global
convergence, and this allowed them to prove that the broad class of polar codes
converge to capacity at polynomial block lengths. Their analysis easily adapts
to show exponentially small failure probabilities, provided the associated
martingale, the ``Arikan martingale'', exhibits a corresponding strong local
effect. The main contribution of this work is a much stronger local analysis of
the Arikan martingale. This leads to the general result claimed above. In
addition to our general result, we also show, for the first time, polar codes
that achieve failure probability $\exp(-N^{\beta})$ for any $\beta < 1$ while
converging to capacity at block length polynomial in the gap to capacity.
Finally we also show that the ``local'' approach can be combined with any
analysis of failure probability of an arbitrary polar code to get essentially
the same failure probability while achieving block length polynomial in the gap
to capacity.

sensing different human activities as a function of modulations in the wireless
signal that travels between wireless devices. Until now, most research has
taken a statistical approach and/or purpose-built inference pipeline. Although
interesting, these approaches struggle to sustain sensing performances beyond
experimental conditions. As such, the full potential of CSI as a
general-purpose sensing modality is yet to be realised. We argue a universal
approach with well-grounded formalisation is necessary to characterise the
relationship between wireless channel modulations (spatial and temporal) and
human movement. To this end, we present a formalism for quantifying the
changing part of the wireless signal modulated by human motion. Grounded in
this formalisation, we then present a new subspace tracking technique to
describe the channel statistics in an interpretable way, which succinctly
contains the human modulated part of the channel. We characterise the signal
and noise subspaces for the case of uncontrolled human movement, and show that
these subspaces are dynamic. Our results demonstrate that proposed channel
statistics alone can robustly reproduce state-of-the-art application-specific
feature engineering baseline, however, across multiple usage scenarios. We
expect, our universal channel statistics will yield an effective
general-purpose featurisation of wireless channel measurements and will uncover
opportunities for applying CSI for a variety of human sensing applications in a
robust way.

an interstellar object traverses, as well as the scale height and length of the
Milky Way's disk. The likelihood of Galactic panspermia is strongly dependent
upon the survival lifetime of the putative organisms as well as the velocity of
the transporter. Velocities between $10-100$ km s$^{-1}$ result in the highest
probabilities. However, given large enough survival lifetimes, even
hypervelocity objects traveling at over 1000 km s$^{-1}$ have a significant
chance of capture, thereby increasing the likelihood of panspermia. Thus, we
show that panspermia is not exclusively relegated to solar-system sized scales,

vectors is crucial. The need to generate tests quickly, however, is
antithetical to the use of a constraint solver. Our solution to this problem is
to use the constraint solver to generate an initial solution, to generalize
that solution relative to the system model, and then to perform rapid,
repeated, randomized sampling of the generalized solution space to generate
fuzzing tests. Crucial to the success of this endeavor is a generalization
procedure with reasonable size and performance costs that produces generalized
solution spaces that can be sampled efficiently. This paper describes a
generalization technique for logical formulae expressed in terms of Boolean
combinations of linear constraints that meets the unique performance
requirements of model-based fuzzing. The technique represents generalizations
using trapezoidal solution sets consisting of ordered, hierarchical
conjunctions of linear constraints that are more expressive than simple
intervals but are more efficient to manipulate and sample than generic
polytopes. Supporting materials contain an ACL2 proof that verifies the
correctness of a low-level implementation of the generalization algorithm

and semi-autonomous vehicles for land, sea, air, and space presents a
significant challenge. Autonomy algorithms, e.g., route planning, pattern
matching, and inference, are based on complex data structures such as directed
graphs and algebraic data types. Proof techniques for these data structures
exist, but are oriented to unbounded, functional realizations, which are not
typically efficient in either space or time. Autonomous systems designers, on
the other hand, generally limit the space and time allocations for any given
function, and require that algorithms deliver results within a finite time, or
suffer a watchdog timeout. Furthermore, high-assurance design rules frown on
dynamic memory allocation, preferring simple array-based data structure
implementations.
  In order to provide efficient implementations of high-level data structures
used in autonomous systems with the high assurance needed for accreditation, we
have developed a verifying compilation technique that supports the ""natural""
functional proof style, but yet applies to more efficient data structure
implementations. Our toolchain features code generation to mainstream
programming languages, as well as GPU-based and hardware-based realizations. We

The proof consists of four parts. First, continuity for both complex-valued and
real-valued functions of complex numbers is defined, and it is shown that
continuous functions from the complex to the real numbers achieve a minimum
value over a closed square region. An important case of continuous real-valued,
complex functions results from taking the traditional complex norm of a
continuous complex function. We think of these continuous functions as having
only one (complex) argument, but in ACL2(r) they appear as functions of two
arguments. The extra argument is a ""context"", which is uninterpreted. For
example, it could be other arguments that are held fixed, as in an exponential
function which has a base and an exponent, either of which could be held fixed.
Second, it is shown that complex polynomials are continuous, so the norm of a
complex polynomial is a continuous real-valued function and it achieves its
minimum over an arbitrary square region centered at the origin. This part of
the proof benefits from the introduction of the ""context"" argument, and it
illustrates an innovation that simplifies the proofs of classical properties
with unbound parameters. Third, we derive lower and upper bounds on the norm of
non-constant polynomials for inputs that are sufficiently far away from the
origin. This means that a sufficiently large square can be found to guarantee
that it contains the global minimum of the norm of the polynomial. Fourth, it
is shown that if a given number is not a root of a non-constant polynomial,
then it cannot be the global minimum. Finally, these results are combined to
show that the global minimum must be a root of the polynomial. This result is
part of a larger effort in the formalization of complex polynomials in ACL2(r).

normalized cross correlation (NCC), for robustness to intensity variations,

The ""if part"" of this theorem follows from a sketching algorithm of Indyk (FOCS
2000). The contribution of AKR is therefore to demonstrate that the mere
availability of a sketching algorithm implies the existence of the
aforementioned geometric realization. Indyk's algorithm shows that the ""if
part"" of the AKR characterization holds true for any metric space whatsoever,
i.e., the existence of an embedding as above implies sketchability even when
$X$ is not a normed space. Due to this, a natural question that AKR posed was
whether the assumption that the underlying space is a normed space is needed
for their characterization of sketchability. We resolve this question by
proving that for arbitrarily large $n\in \mathbb{N}$ there is an $n$-point
metric space $(M(n),d_{M(n)})$ which is $O(1)$-sketchable yet for every

their kinetic energy evolutions are studied in detail, to identify specific
signatures of the DMLR through particle characteristics. The charged particle
orbits are influenced mainly by magnetic curvature drifts. We identify complex,
temporarily trapped, trajectories where the combined electric field and
(reconnected) magnetic field variations realize local cavities where particles
gain energy before escaping. By comparing the orbits in strongly deformed
fields due to the KHI development, with the textbook mirror-drift orbits
resulting from our initial configuration, we identify effects due to current
sheets formed in the DMLR process. We do this in various representative stages

that TIM achieves the optimal symmetric DoF when internal conflict does not

these problems in mind, we propose a method to derive maximal topology directly
in TIM, named as alliance construction in K-user interference channel. That is,
it is proved that a topology is maximal if and only if it is derived from
alliance construction. We translate a topology design by alliance construction
in message graph into topology matrix and propose conditions for maximal

the Lipschitz constant, and prove that a growing estimate of the Lipschitz
constant is in some sense ``harmless''. Our experiments on 15 datasets with 4

is to learn from demonstrations on sub-tasks then autonomously bootstrap a

validated in a simulation environment on an aerial and ground coordination
scenario, where an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is required to maintain three

algorithm while learning could lead to the damage of the platform. We then take
this extra step to test the algorithm in a physical environment. We propose a
safety-net as a protection layer to ensure that the autonomy of the algorithm
in learning does not compromise the safety of the platform. The tests of ABS-DL
in the real environment can guarantee a damage-free, collision avoidance
behaviour of autonomous bodies. The results show that performance of the
proposed approach is comparable to that of a human, and competitive to the
traditional approach using expert demonstrations performed on the composite

both the inverse and prediction problems in a hierarchical Bayesian framework.
We then show how to incorporate so-called posterior-informed model
approximation error into this hierarchical framework, using a modified form of
the Bayesian approximation error (BAE) approach. This enables the use of a
`coarse', approximate model in place of a finer, more expensive model, while
accounting for the additional uncertainty and potential bias that this can
introduce. Our method requires only simple probability modelling, a relatively
small number of fine model simulations, and only modifies the target posterior
-- any standard MCMC sampling algorithm can be used to sample the new
posterior. These corrections can also be used in methods that are not based on
MCMC sampling. We show that our approach can achieve significant computational
speed-ups on two geothermal test problems. We also demonstrate the dangers of
naively using coarse, approximate models in place of finer models, without
accounting for the induced approximation errors. The naive approach tends to
give overly confident and biased posteriors while incorporating BAE into our

These approaches are not scalable to large size models. The proposed framework,
based on LaSalle's invariance principle, uses convex Lyapunov functions to
develop a novel stability certificate which consists of a limited number of

distribution. The implied FRB rate is significantly lower than the
$37$\,sky$^{-1}$\,day$^{-1}$ calculated using nominal exposures and

all attempts have been the low number of detected FRBs, and the difficulty of
defining a completeness threshold for FRB surveys. In this work, we extend
maximum-likelihood methods for estimating $\alpha$, using detected and
threshold signal-to-noise ratios applied to all FRBs in a sample without regard
to a completeness threshold. Using this method with FRBs detected by the Parkes
radio telescope, we find $\alpha=-1.18 \pm 0.24$ (68\% confidence interval,
C.I.), i.e.\ consistent with a non-evolving Euclidean distribution
($\alpha=-1.5$). Applying these methods to the Australian Square Kilometre

($2.6\, \sigma$). If not due to statistical fluctuations or biases in Parkes
data, this is the first evidence for deviations from a pure power law in the
integral source-count distribution of FRBs. It is consistent with a steepening
of the integral source-count distribution in the fluence range 5--40\,Jy\,ms,
for instance due to a cosmological population of FRB progenitors evolving more
rapidly than the star-formation rate, and peaking in the redshift range 1--3.

records corresponding to different physical entities into different clusters.
  We introduce a framework which we call promise correlation clustering. Given
a complete graph $G$ with the edges labelled $0$ and $1$, the goal is to find a
clustering that minimizes the number of $0$ edges within a cluster plus the
number of $1$ edges across different clusters (or correlation loss). The
optimal clustering can also be viewed as a complete graph $G^*$ with edges
corresponding to points in the same cluster being labelled $0$ and other edges
being labelled $1$. Under the promise that the edge difference between $G$ and
$G^*$ is ""small"", we prove that finding the optimal clustering (or $G^*$) is
still NP-Hard. [Ashtiani et. al, 2016] introduced the framework of
semi-supervised clustering, where the learning algorithm has access to an
oracle, which answers whether two points belong to the same or different
clusters. We further prove that even with access to a same-cluster oracle, the
promise version is NP-Hard as long as the number queries to the oracle is not
too large ($o(n)$ where $n$ is the number of vertices).
  Given these negative results, we consider a restricted version of correlation
clustering. As before, the goal is to find a clustering that minimizes the
correlation loss. However, we restrict ourselves to a given class $\mathcal F$
of clusterings. We offer a semi-supervised algorithmic approach to solve the
restricted variant with success guarantees.

quantum system $B$ is studied. Only system $A$ is accessible through time
dependent controls, while system B is not accessible. The objective is to find
controls that implement a desired unitary transformation on $A$, regardless of
the evolution on $B$, at a sufficiently large final time. The freedom in the
evolution on $B$ is used to define an \emph{extended control landscape} on
which the critical points are investigated in terms of kinematic and dynamic
gradients. A spectral decomposition of the corresponding extended unitary
system simplifies the landscape analysis which provides: (i) a sufficient
condition on the rank of the dynamic gradient of the extended landscape that
guarantees a trap free search for the final time unitary matrix of system $A$,
and (ii) a detailed decomposition of the components of the overall dynamic
gradient matrix. Consequently, if the rank condition is satisfied, a gradient
algorithm will find the controls that implements the target unitary on system
$A$. It is shown that even if the dynamic gradient with respect to the controls
alone is not full rank, the additional flexibility due to the parameters that
define the extended landscape still can allow for the rank condition of the
extended landscape to hold. Moreover, satisfaction of the latter rank condition
subsumes any assumptions about controllability, reachability and control
resources. Here satisfaction of the rank condition is taken as an assumption.
The conditions which ensure that it holds remain an open research question. We
lend some numerical support with two common examples for which the rank
condition holds.

flux rise times and asymmetric light curves reported in these sources can
naturally be explained within the context of superradiance. When a threshold
for the inverted population column density is exceeded in a maser-hosting
region, the radiation mode switches from one regulated by stimulated emission
(maser) to superradiance. Superradiance, as a more efficient energy release
mechanism, manifests itself through strong bursts of radiation emanating from
spatially compact regions. Elevated inverted population densities and the
triggering of superradiance can be due to a change in radiative pumping. Here,
we show that an increase in the pump rate and the inverted population density
of only a factor of a few results in a significant increase in radiation. While
the changes in the pump rate can take place over a few hundred days, the rise
in radiation flux density when superradiance is initiated is drastic and
happens over a much shorter time-scale.

an anomaly that does not appear obvious using standard physics. Various

characterize this phenomenon. It was observed that it is possible to reverse
the force by adding conductive materials in the immediate proximity of the
cathode when physically separated from the anode (thus not galvanically
connected). Conversely, the addition of conductive materials in the area
surrounding the anode did not alter the original force observed. The data
gathered seems to confirm a phenomenon that could be exploited for propulsion
purposes, in particular for fuel-less applications in a vacuum. The results
could be correlated to an external cause which appear to be influenced by the

information freshness. It differs from the traditional delay metric, because it
is destination centric and measures the time that elapsed since the last
received fresh information update was generated at the source. AoI has been
analyzed for several queueing models, and the problem of optimizing AoI over
arrival and service rates has been studied in the literature. We consider the
problem of minimizing AoI over the space of update generation and service time

considering several queueing systems, we show that in certain settings,
deterministic service can in fact result in the worst case AoI, while a
heavy-tailed distributed service can yield the minimum AoI. This leads to an
interesting conclusion that, in some queueing systems, the service time
distribution that minimizes expected packet delay, or variance in packet delay
can, in fact, result in the worst case AoI. This exposes a fundamental
difference between AoI metrics and packet delay.

consecutive edges have the same color. The problem of determining the existence
of alternating Hamiltonian paths and cycles in $2$-edge-colored multigraphs is
an $\mathcal{NP}$-complete problem and it has been studied by several authors.
In Bang-Jensen and Gutin's book ""Digraphs: Theory, Algorithms and
Applications"", it is devoted one chapter to survey the last results on this
topic. Most results on the existence of alternating Hamiltonian paths and
cycles concern on complete and bipartite complete multigraphs and a few ones on
multigraphs with high monochromatic degrees or regular monochromatic subgraphs.
In this work, we use a different approach imposing local conditions on the
multigraphs and it is worthwhile to notice that the class of multigraphs we
deal with is much larger than, and includes, complete multigraphs, and we
provide a full characterization of this class.
  Given a $2$-edge-colored multigraph $G$, we say that $G$ is
$2$-$\mathcal{M}$-closed (resp. $2$-$\mathcal{NM}$-closed)} if for every
monochromatic (resp. non-monochromatic) $2$-path $P=(x_1, x_2, x_3)$, there
exists an edge between $x_1$ and $x_3$. In this work we provide the following
characterization: A $2$-$\mathcal{M}$-closed multigraph has an alternating
Hamiltonian cycle if and only if it is color-connected and it has an
alternating cycle factor.
  Furthermore, we construct an infinite family of $2$-$\mathcal{NM}$-closed
graphs, color-connected, with an alternating cycle factor, and with no
alternating Hamiltonian cycle.

challenging opportunities in spintronics with intriguing antisymmetric
phenomena. The role of the DMI, however, is still being debated, largely
because distinct strengths of DMI have been measured for different magnetic
objects, particularly chiral magnetic domain walls (DWs) and non-reciprocal
spin waves (SWs). In this paper, we show that, after careful data analysis,
both the DWs and SWs experience the same strength of DMI. This was confirmed by
spin-torque efficiency measurement for the DWs, and Brillouin light scattering
measurement for the SWs. This observation, therefore, indicates the unique role
of the DMI on the magnetic DW and SW dynamics and also guarantees the
compatibility of several DMI-measurement schemes recently proposed.

  version",,,,"cs.CG math.AT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Persistent homology is a popular data analysis technique that is used to
capture the changing topology of a filtration associated with some simplicial
complex $K$. These topological changes are summarized in persistence diagrams.
We propose two contraction operators which when applied to $K$ and its
associated filtration, bound the perturbation in the persistence diagrams. The
first assumes that the underlying space of $K$ is a $2$-manifold and ensures
that simplices are paired with the same simplices in the contracted complex as
they are in the original. The second is for arbitrary $d$-complexes, and bounds
the bottleneck distance between the initial and contracted $p$-dimensional
persistence diagrams. This is accomplished by defining interleaving maps
between persistence modules which arise from chain maps defined over the
filtrations. In addition, we show how the second operator can efficiently
compose across multiple contractions. We conclude with experiments
demonstrating the second operator's utility on manifolds.

the two main sources of artifacts influencing the perceived quality. To assess
this influence, quality evaluation studies are often carried out using
conventional displays and generating predefined navigation trajectories
mimicking the possible movement of the viewers when exploring the content.
Nevertheless, as different trajectories may lead to different conclusions in
terms of visual quality when benchmarking the performance of the systems,
methods to identify critical trajectories are needed. This paper aims at
exploring the impact of exploration trajectories (defined as Hypothetical
Rendering Trajectories: HRT) on perceived quality of FVV subjectively and
objectively, providing two main contributions. Firstly, a subjective assessment
test including different HRTs was carried out and analyzed. The results
demonstrate and quantify the influence of HRT in the perceived quality.
Secondly, we propose a new objective video quality assessment measure to
objectively predict the impact of HRT. This measure, based on Sketch-Token
representation, models how the categories of the contours change spatially and
temporally from a higher semantic level. Performance in comparison with
existing quality metrics for FVV, highlight promising results for automatic

the compartments inside the biological cells. The compartments are viewed as
nodes that are labeled with the containing chemicals and the transport channels
are similarly viewed as labeled edges between the nodes. Understanding VTSs is
an ongoing area of research and for many cells they are partially known. For
example, there may be undiscovered edges, nodes, or their labels in a VTS of a
cell. It has been speculated that there are properties that the VTSs must
satisfy. For example, stability, i.e., every chemical that is leaving a
compartment comes back. Many synthesis questions may arise in this scenario,
where we want to complete a partially known VTS under a given property. In the
paper, we present novel encodings of the above questions into the QBF
(quantified Boolean formula) satisfiability problems. We have implemented the
encodings in a highly configurable tool and applied to a couple of

joint environmental parameters (wind, wave, currents, etc.). Environmental
contours are useful representations to provide multivariate design conditions.
However, these contours may lead to different design points depending on the

In this work, we propose to use a response meta-model for the inter-comparison
of some state-of-the-art methods available for modelling multivariate extremes,
in order to provide a straightforward methodology, focusing on the derivation
of three-dimensional contours. The considered case study focuses on the tension
in a mooring line of a semi-submersible platform. In a first step, the key

mooring line are set-up. Several multivariate extreme analysis methods are then
applied to derive the environmental contours. These methods are chosen in order
to cover all the possible dependence cases, from extremal dependence to
extremal independence. Conditional Extreme and several extreme value dependence
function models are investigated. The physical-space Huseby contouring method
is used to derive environmental surface. A comparison with the extreme load
extrapolated from the meta-model is provided to assess the performance of each
method.

require a proper definition, and it should be possible to explain how one can
reconstruct a band-limited function from its samples by means of simple series
expansions. It should also be useful for graduate students who want to see how
functional analysis can help to understand fairly practical problems, or
teachers who want to offer a course related to the ""Mathematical Foundations of

terms from linear functional analysis, namely Banach spaces and their duals,
bounded linear operators and a simple version of weak$^{*}$-convergence. As a
matter of fact we use a set of function spaces which is quite different from
the collection of Lebesgue spaces used normally. We thus avoid the use of
Lebesgue integration theory. Furthermore we avoid topological vector spaces in
the form of the Schwartz space. Although all tools developed and presented can
be realized on LCA groups, we restrict our attention in the current

over $R^d$. This allows us to make use of simple bounded, uniform partitions of
unity, to apply dilation operators and to make use of special functions such as
the Gaussian. The problems of the overall current situation, with the
separation of theoretical Fourier Analysis as carried out by (pure)
mathematicians and Applied Fourier Analysis (as used in engineering
applications) are getting bigger and therefore courses filling the gap are in

to the recent experimental efforts to synthesize the isotope ^{299}120 in a
fusion reaction at the velocity filter SHIP (GSI Darmstadt), which makes
synthesis of Z = 122 nuclei to occur in the near future, and in turn will give
the experimentalist the chance observe the decays associated with the isotopes
of this nuclei. We perform our calculations by choosing the Woods Saxon
potential for nuclear interaction, along with Coulomb potential and centrifugal
potential within the framework of the WKB method. When the centrifugal term is
taken in the total potential and WKB integral is done over 1D radial
coordinate, it requires the use of Langer modification wherein (l + 1/2 )^2
replaces l(l +1) for consistency of WKB wave function. Hence we have used this
Langer modified centrifugal potential. The orientations of deformed nuclei are
important, as it affects the touching distance and also influence the nuclear
and Coulomb potential, and thus can alter the values of penetration integral
and half-life. The results obtained by our calculations are in agreement with
the values obtained from various phenomenological models. This study brings out
the unique characteristics of alpha chains associated with each isotope, which
will be helpful for the experimentalist to decide the isotope they would like
to synthesize and also for their post-synthesis study.

Giant Branch (AGB) star EP Aqr have been made with four times better spatial
resolution than previously available. They are analysed with emphasis on the
de-projection in space of the effective emissivity and flux of matter using as
input a prescribed configuration of the velocity field, assumed to be radial.
The data are found to display an intrinsic axi-symmetry with respect to an axis
making a small angle with the line of sight. A broad range of wind
configurations, from prolate (bipolar) to oblate (equatorial) has been studied
and found to be accompanied by significant equatorial emission. Qualitatively,
the effective emissivity is enhanced near the equator to produce the central
narrow component observed in the Doppler velocity spectra and its dependence on
star latitude generally follows that of the wind velocity with the exception of
an omni-present depression near the poles. In particular, large equatorial
expansion velocities produce a flared disc or a ring of effective emissivity
and mass loss. The effect on the determination of the orientation of the star
axis of radial velocity gradients and possibly competing rotation and expansion
in the equatorial disc is discussed. In general, the flux of matter is found to
reach a broad maximum at distances of the order of 500 au from the star.
Arguments are given that may be used to prefer one wind velocity distribution
to another. As a result of the improved quality of the data, a deeper
understanding of the constraints imposed on morphology and kinematics has been
obtained.

the structure erupted to a major coronal mass ejection (CME) accompanied by an
X9.3 class flare. For the X2.2 flare, we do not find EUV dimmings, separation
of its flare ribbons, or clear CME signatures, suggesting a confined flare. For
the X9.3 flare, large-scale dimmings, separation of its flare ribbons, and a
CME show it to be eruptive. By performing a time sequence of nonlinear
force-free fields (NLFFFs) extrapolations we find that: until the eruptive
flare, an MFR-system was located in the AR. During the confined flare, the
axial flux and the lower bound of the magnetic helicity for the MFR-system were
dramatically enhanced by about 86% and 260%, respectively, although the mean
twist number was almost unchanged. During the eruptive flare, the three
parameters were all significantly reduced. The results evidence the buildup and
release of the MFR-system during the confined and the eruptive flare,
respectively. The former may be achieved by flare reconnection. We also
calculate the pre-flare distributions of the decay index above the main
polarity inversion line (PIL) and find no significant difference. It indicates
that the buildup of the magnetic flux and helicity of the MFR-system may play a

out the general solution, which happens to consist in a single metric. All the
embedded Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metrics can be obtained from this
'mother' metric ('M-metric') in the bulk, by projecting onto different
four-dimensional hypersurfaces (branes). Having a time plane in the bulk allows
to devise the specific curve which will be kept as the physical time coordinate
in the brane. This method is applied for identifying FRW regular solutions,
evolving from the infinite past (no Big Bang), even with an asymptotic initial
state with non-zero radius (emergent universes). Explicit counter-examples are
provided, showing that not every spatially-flat FRW metric can actually be

solving two-player zero-sum extensive games with imperfect information and
achieves state-of-the-art performance in practice. However, the performance of
CFR is not fully understood, since empirical results on the regret are much
better than the upper bound proved in \cite{zinkevich2008regret}. Another issue
is that CFR has to traverse the whole game tree in each round, which is
time-consuming in large scale games. In this paper, we present a novel
technique, lazy update, which can avoid traversing the whole game tree in CFR,
as well as a novel analysis on the regret of CFR with lazy update. Our analysis
can also be applied to the vanilla CFR, resulting in a much tighter regret
bound than that in \cite{zinkevich2008regret}. Inspired by lazy update, we
further present a novel CFR variant, named Lazy-CFR. Compared to traversing
$O(|\mathcal{I}|)$ information sets in vanilla CFR, Lazy-CFR needs only to
traverse $O(\sqrt{|\mathcal{I}|})$ information sets per round while keeping the
regret bound almost the same, where $\mathcal{I}$ is the class of all
information sets. As a result, Lazy-CFR shows better convergence result
compared with vanilla CFR. Experimental results consistently show that Lazy-CFR
outperforms the vanilla CFR significantly.

circumvent this theorem. These notably include solutions with a time-dependent
scalar field in order to match cosmological evolution, but also static and
asymptotically flat configurations. In a third part, we establish an important

methods that control the finite sample bias is growing. This is mainly due to
the frequent settings where the number of variables is large and allowed to
increase with the sample size bringing standard inferential procedures to incur
significant loss in terms of performance. Moreover, the complexity of
statistical models is also increasing thereby entailing important computational
challenges in constructing new estimators or in implementing classical ones. A
trade-off between numerical complexity and statistical properties is often
accepted. However, numerically efficient estimators that are altogether
unbiased, consistent and asymptotically normal in high dimensional problems
would generally be ideal. In this paper, we set a general framework from which
such estimators can easily be derived for wide classes of models. This
framework is based on the concepts that underlie simulation-based estimation
methods such as indirect inference. The approach allows various extensions
compared to previous results as it is adapted to possibly inconsistent
estimators and is applicable to discrete models and/or models with a large
number of parameters. We consider an algorithm, namely the Iterative Bootstrap
(IB), to efficiently compute simulation-based estimators by showing its
convergence properties. Within this framework we also prove the properties of
simulation-based estimators, more specifically the unbiasedness, consistency
and asymptotic normality when the number of parameters is allowed to increase
with the sample size. Therefore, an important implication of the proposed
approach is that it allows to obtain unbiased estimators in finite samples.
Finally, we study this approach when applied to three common models, namely
logistic regression, negative binomial regression and lasso regression.

act by learning to: (i) infer meaning behind their partner's actions, and (ii)
convey private information about the state to their partner implicitly through

multi-agent systems, whereas the second --- which is equally crucial for
successful collaboration --- has not. To mimic both components mentioned above,
thereby completing the learning process, we introduce a novel algorithm: Policy
Belief Learning (PBL). PBL uses a belief module to model the other agent's
private information and a policy module to form a distribution over actions
informed by the belief module. Furthermore, to encourage communication by
actions, we propose a novel auxiliary reward which incentivizes one agent to
help its partner to make correct inferences about its private information. The
auxiliary reward for communication is integrated into the learning of the
policy module. We evaluate our approach on a set of environments including a
matrix game, particle environment and the non-competitive bidding problem from
contract bridge. We show empirically that this auxiliary reward is effective
and easy to generalize. These results demonstrate that our PBL algorithm can

observable for gauging different matter components. This work tests the
flatness of the MW rotation curve with a simple general relativistic model
suitable to represent the geometry of a disk as a stationary axisymmetric dust
metric at a sufficiently large distance from a central body. Circular
velocities of unprecedented accuracy were derived from the Gaia DR2 data for a
carefully selected sample of disk stars. We then fit these velocities to both
the classical, i.e. including a dark matter halo, rotation curve model and a
relativistic analogue, as derived form the solution of Einstein's equation. The
GR-compliant MW rotational curve model results statistically indistinguishable
from its state-of-the-art DM analogue. This supports our ansatz that a
stationary and axisymmetric galaxy-scale metric could ""fill the gap"" in a
baryons-only Milky Way, suggestive of star orbits dragged along the background
geometry. We confirmed that geometry is a manifestation of gravity according to
the Einstein theory, in particular the weak gravitational effect due to the
off-diagonal term of the metric could mimic for a ""DM-like"" effect in the

Superconductivity then emerges, at least at weak doping, already from the state
with broken $C_4$ rotational symmetry. One of the few stoichiometric IBS,
lithium iron arsenide, superconducts below 18 K and does not display either
structural or magnetic transition in the normal state. Here we demonstrate,
using angle-resolved photoemission, that even superconducting state in LiFeAs
is also a nematic one. We observe spontaneous breaking of the rotational
symmetry in the gap amplitude on all Fermi surfaces, as well as unidirectional
distortion of the Fermi pockets. Remarkably, these deformations disappear above
superconducting $T_c$. Our results demonstrate the realization of a novel
phenomenon of superconductivity-induced nematicity in IBS, emphasizing the
intimate relation between them. We suggest a theoretical explanation based on
the emergence of a secondary instability inside the superconducting state,

coefficients are commonly estimated by local smoothing methods, e.g. local

procedure for hundreds of times to obtain an estimate of one function. So the
computation cost is very severe. In this paper, we give an insight to the
trade-off between statistical efficiency and computation simplicity, and
proposes a fast inference procedure for semivarying coefficient model. In our
method, the coefficient functions are approximated by piecewise constants,
which is a simple and rough approximation. This makes our estimators easy to
implement and avoid repeat estimation. In this work, we shall show that though
these estimators are not asymptotically optimal, they are efficient enough for
building further inference procedure. Furthermore, three tests are brought out

compared with data recorded in 2012. During normal physics operation this
background arises mainly from scattering of the 4 TeV protons on residual gas
in the beam pipe. Methods of reconstructing the BIB signals in the ATLAS
detector, developed and implemented in the simulation chain based on the FLUKA
Monte Carlo simulation package, are described. The interaction rates are
determined from the residual gas pressure distribution in the LHC ring in order
to set an absolute scale on the predicted rates of BIB so that they can be
compared quantitatively with data. Through these comparisons the origins of the
BIB leading to different observables in the ATLAS detectors are analysed. The
level of agreement between simulation results and BIB measurements by ATLAS in
2012 demonstrates that a good understanding of the origin of BIB has been
reached.

unharmed beyond 10 Myr. However, their compactness means a high stellar density
which can lead to strong gravitational interactions between the stars. As young
stars are often initially surrounded by protoplanetary disks and later on
potentially by planetary systems, the question arises to what degree these
strong gravitational interactions influence planet formation and the properties
of planetary systems. Here, we perform simulations of the evolution of compact
high-mass clusters like Trumpler 14 and Westerlund 2 from the embedded to the
gas-free phase and study the influence of stellar interactions. We concentrate
on the development of the mean disk size in these environments. Our simulations
show that in high-mass open clusters $80-90\%$ of all disks/planetary systems
should be smaller than 50 AU just due to the strong stellar interactions in
these environments. Already in the initial phases, 3-4 close fly-bys lead to
typical disk sizes within the range of 18-27 AU. Afterwards, the disk sizes are
altered only to a small extent. Our findings agree with the recent observation
that the disk sizes in the once dense environment of the Upper Scorpio OB
association, NGC~2362, and h/$\chi$Persei are at least three times smaller in
size than, for example, in Taurus. We conclude that the observed planetary
systems in high-mass open clusters should also be on average smaller than those
found around field stars; in particular, planets on wide orbits are expected to
be extremely rare in such environments.

an accretion disk. Due to emission of gravitational waves, the mass of the
central object decreases and accretion disk experiences perturbation.
Calculations show that the main consequence of this disturbance is formation of
a shock wave propagating from the center of the disk to its periphery. Light
curve is computed and duration of the flash is estimated under assumption that
the flash terminates when the luminosity returns to the initial value.
  It is shown that, if the total mass of the merging binary is 55 M_sol (like
in the event GW170814), the flash produced by the shock will increase
bolometric luminosity of the disk by 4--6 orders of magnitude, up to 10^{45}
erg/s (absolute stellar magnitude -23.8^m). With account of the distance to the
source (540 Mpc) and for reasonable assumptions on the parameters of the
accretion disk, it turns out that the apparent magnitude of the flash at the
maximum of the spectral flux density should be 12.8^m -- 14.2^m, while duration
of the flash --- few minutes.
  The main part of the shock radiation flux is emitted in the X-ray and
gamma-ray ranges. In the spectral band of the EPIC instrument of the XMM-Newton
observatory or the telescope eROSITA of the Spectrum-RG observatory (0.3--10
keV), luminosity will increase by 3--4 orders of magnitude, up to 10^{44}
erg/s, corresponding to the apparent stellar magnitude about 17^m. Luminosity
is at maximum in the observational band of the IBIS instrument of the INTEGRAL

contact mechanics until 1971, when Johnson, Kendall and Roberts (JKR)
generalized Hertz' solution for an elastic sphere using an energetic argument
which we now recognize to be analogous to that used in linear elastic fracture
mechanics. A significant result is that the load-displacement relation exhibits
instabilities in which approaching bodies `jump in' to contact, whereas
separated bodies `jump out' at a tensile `pull-off force'. The JKR approach has
since been widely used in other geometries, but at small length scales or for
stiffer materials it is found to be less accurate. In conformal contact
problems, other instabilities can occur, characterized by the development of
regular patterns of regions of large and small traction. All these
instabilities result in differences between loading and unloading curves and
consequent hysteretic energy losses. Adhesive contact mechanics has become
increasingly important in recent years with the focus on soft materials [which
generally permit larger areas of the interacting surfaces to come within the
range of adhesive forces], nano-devices and the analysis of bio-systems.
Applications are found in nature, such as insect attachment forces, in
nano-manufacturing, and more generally in industrial systems involving rubber
or polymer contacts. In this paper, we review the strengths and limitations of
various methods for analyzing contact problems involving adhesive tractions,
with particular reference to the effect of the inevitable roughness of the

high-quality stimuli. In real world, however, captured images undergo various
types of distortions during the whole acquisition, transmission, and displaying
chain. Some distortion types include motion blur, lighting variations and
rotation. Despite few efforts, influences of ubiquitous distortions on visual
attention and saliency models have not been systematically investigated. In
this paper, we first create a large-scale database including eye movements of
10 observers over 1900 images degraded by 19 types of distortions. Second, by
analyzing eye movements and saliency models, we find that: a) observers look at
different locations over distorted versus original images, and b) performances
of saliency models are drastically hindered over distorted images, with the
maximum performance drop belonging to Rotation and Shearing distortions.
Finally, we investigate the effectiveness of different distortions when serving
as data augmentation transformations. Experimental results verify that some
useful data augmentation transformations which preserve human gaze of reference
images can improve deep saliency models against distortions, while some invalid
transformations which severely change human gaze will degrade the performance.

with deformable objects is an open issue. More specifically, tasks like tying a
knot, wiring a connector or even surgical suturing deal with the domain of
Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs). In particular the detection of a DLO is a
non-trivial problem especially under clutter and occlusions (as well as
self-occlusions). The pose estimation of a DLO results into the identification
of its parameters related to a designed model, e.g. a basis spline. It follows
that the stand-alone segmentation of a DLO might not be sufficient to conduct a
full manipulation task. This is why we propose a novel framework able to
perform both a semantic segmentation and b-spline modeling of multiple
deformable linear objects simultaneously without strict requirements about
environment (i.e. the background). The core algorithm is based on biased random
walks over the Region Adiacency Graph built on a superpixel oversegmentation of
the source image. The algorithm is initialized by a Convolutional Neural
Networks that detects the DLO's endcaps. An open source implementation of the
proposed approach is also provided to easy the reproduction of the whole

to enhance the observed number of Ly-alpha photons per incident ionizing

photoionization models, we explore the impact of ionization parameter, gas
metallicity, ionizing spectrum, electron energy distribution, and cloud viewing
angle on the relative fluxes of Ly-alpha, HeII and other lines, and on the
observed number of Ly-alpha photons per incident ionizing photon. We find that
low ionization parameter, a relatively soft or filtered ionizing spectrum, low
gas metallicity, kappa-distributed electron energies, or reflection of Ly-alpha
photons by HI can all result in significantly enhanced Ly-alpha relative to
other lines (>10%), with log Ly-alpha/HeII reaching values up to 4.6. In the
cases of low gas metallicity, reflection by HI, or a hard or filtered ionizing
spectrum, the observed number of Ly-alpha photons per incident ionizing photon
is itself significantly enhanced above the nominal Case B value of 0.66 due to
collisional excitation, reaching values up to 5.3 in our 'extreme case' model.
At low gas metallicity (e.g. 0.1 x Solar), the production of Ly-alpha is
predominantly via collisional excitation rather than recombination. In
addition, we find that collisional excitation of Ly-alpha becomes more
efficient if the ionizing continuum is pre-filtered through an optically thin
screen of gas closer to the AGN. We also show that Ly-alpha / HeII ratios of
the z~3.5 quasars studied by Borisova et al. (2016) are consistent with
AGN-photoionization of gas with moderate to low metallicity and/or low
ionization parameter, without requiring exotic ionization/excitation mechanisms
such as strong line-transfer effects. We also present UV-optical diagnostic
diagrams to distinguish between photoionization by Pop III stars and AGN
photoionization.

Nevertheless, most existing works on automatic charge prediction perform
adequately on high-frequency charges but are not yet capable of predicting
few-shot charges with limited cases. In this paper, we propose a Sequence

Specifically, following the work of capsule networks, we propose the seq-caps

introduces focal loss, which relieves the problem of imbalanced charges.

kinetic energy of the system decreases gradually. Consequently the mutual
separation of the objects decreases with time and tends to merge. The whole
process may require a very long time comparable or longer than the age of the
universe, specially in the case of low mass mergers. We have examined the case
in which a massive object compared to the individual masses comprising the

the merging process takes place much rapidly than that of the conventional
BH-BH merging process. Scenarios with both an Intermediate Mass Black Hole

heavy ion (SHI) - matter interaction. It provides explanation to various SHI
induced effects including mixing across interfaces. The model involves
electron-phonon (e-p) coupling to predict the evolution of lattice temperature
with time. SHI mixing is considered to be a result of diffusion in transient
molten state thus achieved. In this work, we assess this conception primarily
via tuning the e-p coupling strength by taking a series Pd$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$ of a
completely solid soluble binary, and then observing 100 MeV Au ion induced
mixing across Pd$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$/Si interfaces. The extent of mixing has been
parametrised by the irradiation induced change $\Delta \sigma^2$ in variances
of Pd and Ni depth profiles derived from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The
$x$-dependence of $\Delta \sigma^2$ follows a curve that is concave upward with
a prominent minimum. Theoretically, e-p coupling strength determined using
density functional theory has been used to solve the equations appropriate to
TSM, and then an equivalent quantity L$^2$ proportional to $\Delta \sigma^2$
has been calculated. L$^2$, however, increases monotonically with $x$ without
any minimum, bringing out a convincing disparity between experiment and theory.
Perhaps some mechanisms more than the TSM plus the transient molten state
diffusion are operative, which can not be foreseen at this point of time.

the quantum system under consideration, such as geometries of atoms of a

parameter determined at different \(\bm{x}\)'s, assuming that the circuit
parameter \(\bm{\theta}\) has simple dependency on a hidden parameter
\(\bm{x}\) as \(\bm{\theta}(\bm{x})\). We show by numerical simulations that,
using an ansatz which we call the Hamiltonian-alternating ansatz, the optimal
circuit parameters can be interpolated to give near-optimal ground states in
between the trained \(\bm{x}\)'s. The proposed method can greatly reduce, on a
rough estimation by a few orders of magnitude, the time required to obtain
ground states for different Hamiltonians by the VQE. Once generalized, the
ansatz circuit can predict the ground state without optimizing the circuit

spin axis directions, and the coarse shapes of a subset of asteroids with
enough observations. One of our aims was to test the reliability of the models
with respect to the number of data points and to check the consistency of these
models with independent data. Another aim was to produce new asteroid models to
enlarge the sample of asteroids with known spin and shape. We used the
lightcurve inversion method to scan the period and pole parameter space to
create final shape models that best reproduce the observed data. To search for
the sidereal rotation period, we also used a simpler model of a geometrically
scattering triaxial ellipsoid. By processing about 5400 asteroids with at least
ten observations in DR2, we derived models for 173 asteroids, 129 of which are
new. Models of the remaining asteroids were already known from the inversion of
independent data, and we used them for verification and error estimation. We
also compared the formally best rotation periods based on Gaia data with those
derived from dense lightcurves. We show that a correct rotation period can be
determined even when the number of observations $N$ is less than 20, but the
rate of false solutions is high. For $N > 30$, the solution of the inverse
problem is often successful and the parameters are likely to be correct in most
cases. These results are very promising because the final Gaia catalogue should
contain photometry for hundreds of thousands of asteroids, typically with
several tens of data points per object, which should be sufficient for reliable

analysis of observations from the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo
gravitational-wave detectors. To this end, iterative simulation techniques, in
particular nested sampling and parallel tempering, have been implemented in the
software library LALInference to sample from the posterior distribution of
waveform parameters of compact binary coalescence events. Nested sampling was
mainly developed to calculate the marginal likelihood of a model but can
produce posterior samples as a by-product. Thermodynamic integration is
employed to calculate the evidence using samples generated by parallel
tempering but has been found to be computationally demanding. Here we propose
the stepping-stone sampling algorithm, originally proposed by Xie et al. (2011)
in phylogenetics and a special case of path sampling, as an alternative to
thermodynamic integration. The stepping-stone sampling algorithm is also based
on samples from the power posteriors of parallel tempering but has superior
performance as fewer temperature steps and thus computational resources are
needed to achieve the same accuracy. We demonstrate its performance and
computational costs in comparison to thermodynamic integration and nested
sampling in a simulation study and a case study of computing the marginal
likelihood of a binary black hole signal model applied to simulated data from
the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational wave detectors. To deal with
the inadequate methods currently employed to estimate the standard errors of
evidence estimates based on power posterior techniques, we propose a novel
block bootstrap approach and show its potential in our simulation study and
LIGO application.

shown to offer significant transmit power savings when compared with the

all time and length scales is not practically possible. Advantage can be taken
particularly from the well-separated time scales of the fundamental surface and
plasma processes. Initially, surface properties may be calculated from a
surface model and stored for a number of representative cases. Subsequently,
the surface data may be provided to gas-phase transport simulations via
appropriate model interfaces (e.g., analytic expressions or look-up tables) and
utilized to define insertion boundary conditions. During run-time evaluation,
however, the maintained surface data may prove to be not sufficient. In this
case, missing data may be obtained by interpolation (common), extrapolation
(inaccurate), or be supplied on-demand by the surface model (computationally
inefficient). In this work, a potential alternative is established based on
machine learning techniques using artificial neural networks. As a proof of
concept, a multilayer perceptron network is trained and verified with sputtered
particle distributions obtained from transport of ions in matter based
simulations for Ar projectiles bombarding a Ti-Al composite. It is demonstrated
that the trained network is able to predict the sputtered particle
distributions for unknown, arbitrarily shaped incident ion energy
distributions. It is consequently argued that the trained network may be

  explanation for section 2.3",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The L1 regularization (Lasso) has proven to be a versatile tool to select
relevant features and estimate the model coefficients simultaneously and has
been widely used in many research areas such as genomes studies, finance, and
biomedical imaging. Despite its popularity, it is very challenging to guarantee
the feature selection consistency of Lasso especially when the dimension of the
data is huge. One way to improve the feature selection consistency is to select
an ideal tuning parameter. Traditional tuning criteria mainly focus on
minimizing the estimated prediction error or maximizing the posterior model
probability, such as cross-validation and BIC, which may either be
time-consuming or fail to control the false discovery rate (FDR) when the
number of features is extremely large. The other way is to introduce
pseudo-features to learn the importance of the original ones. Recently, the
Knockoff filter is proposed to control the FDR when performing feature
selection. However, its performance is sensitive to the choice of the expected
FDR threshold. Motivated by these ideas, we propose a new method using
pseudo-features to obtain an ideal tuning parameter. In particular, we present
the Efficient Tuning of Lasso (ET-Lasso) to separate active and inactive
features by adding permuted features as pseudo-features in linear models. The
pseudo-features are constructed to be inactive by nature, which can be used to
obtain a cutoff to select the tuning parameter that separates active and
inactive features. Experimental studies on both simulations and real-world data
applications are provided to show that ET-Lasso can effectively and efficiently
select active features under a wide range of scenarios

water in atomistic simulations that can span biologically relevant timescales
has born the necessity of coarse-grained (CG) modeling. Despite numerous
advances, CG water models rely mostly on a-priori specified assumptions. How
these assumptions affect the model accuracy, efficiency, and in particular
transferability, has not been systematically investigated. Here we propose a
data driven, comparison and selection for CG water models through a
Hierarchical Bayesian framework. We examine CG water models that differ in
their level of coarse-graining, structure, and number of interaction sites. We
find that the importance of electrostatic interactions for the physical system
under consideration is a dominant criterion for the model selection. Multi-site
models are favored, unless the effects of water in electrostatic screening are
not relevant, in which case the single site model is preferred due to its
computational savings. The charge distribution is found to play an important
role in the multi-site model's accuracy while the flexibility of the
bonds/angles may only slightly improve the models. Furthermore, we find
significant variations in the computational cost of these models. We present a
data informed rationale for the selection of CG water models and provide
guidance for future water model designs.

the assumption that user's images contain a collection of visual elements that
implicitly encode discriminative patterns that allow inferring its gender, in a

and recommendation. Our main hypothesis is that semantic visual features are
more adequate for discriminating high-level classes.
  The gender detection task is formalised as: given an user's profile,
represented as a bag of images, we want to infer the gender of the user. Social
media profiles can be noisy and contain confounding factors, therefore we
classify bags of user-profile's images to provide a more robust prediction.
Experiments using a dataset from the picture sharing social network Instagram
show that the use of multiple images is key to improve detection performance.
Moreover, we verify that deep semantic features are more suited for gender
detection than low-level image representations. The methods proposed can infer
the gender with precision scores higher than 0.825, and the best performing

mass to their host protostars. As a result, gravitational instabilities (GIs)
are expected to play a pivotal role in the early phases of disc evolution.
However, as these young objects are heavily embedded, confirmation of GIs has
remained elusive. Therefore, we use the radiative transfer code LIME to produce
line images of a $0.17\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ self-gravitating protosolar-like
disc. We note the limitations of using LIME and explore methods to improve upon
the default gridding. We synthesise noiseless observations to determine the
sensitivities required to detect the spiral flux, and find that the line flux
distribution does not necessarily correlate to the abundance density
distribution; hence performing radiative transfer calculations is imperative.
Moreover, the spiral features are seen in absorption, due to the GI-heated
midplane and high extinction, which could be indicative of GI activity. If a
small beamsize and appropriate molecular line are used then spatially resolving
spirals in a protosolar-like disc should be possible with ALMA for an on-source
time of 30 hr. Spectrally resolving non-axisymmetric structure takes only a
tenth as long for a reasonable noise level, but attributing this structure to
GI-induced activity would be tentative. Finally, we find that identifying
finger-like features in PV diagrams of nearly edge-on discs, which are a direct
indicator of spirals, is feasible with an on-source time of 19 hr, and hence
likely offers the most promising means of confirming GI-driven spiral structure
in young, embedded protoplanetary discs.

flow for a compact hyperbolic surface. Strict ergodicity is unique ergodicity
with respect to a measure of full support, and therefore implies minimality.
The horocycle flow has been previously studied on minimal foliations by
hyperbolic surfaces on closed manifolds, where it is known not to be minimal in
general. In this paper, we prove that for the special case of Riemannian
foliations, strict ergodicity of the horocycle flow still holds. This in
particular proves that this flow is minimal, which establishes a conjecture
proposed by Matsumoto.
  The main tool is a theorem due to Coud\`ene, which he presented as an
alternative proof for the surface case. It applies to two continuous flows
defining a measure-preserving action of the affine group of the line on a
compact metric space, precisely matching the foliated setting. In addition, we
briefly discuss the application of Coud\`ene's theorem to other kinds of
foliations.

Unfortunately, current spreadsheet smell detection techniques suffer from a
number of drawbacks that lead to incorrect or redundant smell reports. For
example, the same quality issue is often reported for every copy of a cell,
which may overwhelm users. To deal with these issues, we propose to refine
spreadsheet smells by exploiting inferred structural information for smell
detection. We therefore first provide a detailed description of our static
analysis approach to infer clusters and blocks of related cells. We then
elaborate on how to improve existing smells by providing three example
refinements of existing smells that incorporate information about cell groups
and computation blocks. Furthermore, we propose three novel smell detection
techniques that make use of the inferred spreadsheet structures. Empirical
evaluation of the proposed techniques suggests that the refinements
successfully reduce the number of incorrectly and redundantly reported smells,

assumption that the propagating object, i.e., a virus or a piece of
information, is transferred across the nodes without going through any
modification or evolution. However, in real-life spreading processes, pathogens
often evolve in response to changing environments and medical interventions and
information is often modified by individuals before being forwarded. In this
paper, we investigate the evolution of spreading processes on complex networks
with the aim of i) revealing the role of evolution on the threshold,
probability, and final size of epidemics; and ii) exploring the interplay
between the structural properties of the network and the dynamics of evolution.
In particular, we develop a mathematical theory that accurately predicts the
epidemic threshold and the expected epidemic size as functions of the
characteristics of the spreading process, the evolutionary dynamics of the
pathogen, and the structure of the underlying contact network. In addition to
the mathematical theory, we perform extensive simulations on random and
real-world contact networks to verify our theory and reveal the significant
shortcomings of the classical mathematical models that do not capture
evolution. Our results reveal that the classical, single-type bond-percolation
models may accurately predict the threshold and final size of epidemics, but
their predictions on the probability of emergence are inaccurate on both random
and real-world networks. This inaccuracy sheds the light on a fundamental
disconnect between the classical bond-percolation models and real-life
spreading processes that entail evolution. Finally, we consider the case when
co-infection is possible and show that co-infection could lead the order of
phase transition to change from second-order to first-order.

favouring temporal correlations between semantically similar and temporally

the vortical growth and decay phases are characterized by a vortical growth

reasonably occurs in many algorithmic approaches for optimization problems. For
instance, when enumerating minimal dominating sets of a graph $G=(V,E)$, one
usually arrives at the problem to decide for a vertex set $U \subseteq V$, if
there exists a \textit{minimal} dominating set $S$ with $U\subseteq S$. We
propose a general, partial-order based formulation of such extension problems
and study a number of specific problems which can be expressed in this
framework. Possibly contradicting intuition, these problems tend to be NP-hard,
even for problems where the underlying optimisation problem can be solved in
polynomial time. This raises the question of how fixing a partial solution
causes this increase in difficulty. In this regard, we study the parameterised
complexity of extension problems with respect to parameters related to the
partial solution, as well as the optimality of simple exact algorithms under
the Exponential-Time Hypothesis. All complexity considerations are also carried
out in very restricted scenarios, be it degree restrictions or topological
restrictions (planarity) for graph problems or the size of the given partition
for the considered extension variant of Bin Packing.

Faint, and Small disks) based on their appearance in scattered light. We
re-calculated the stellar and disk properties from the newly available GAIA DR2
and related these properties with the disk categories. More than a half of our
sample shows disk sub-structures. For the remaining sources, the absence of
detected features is due to their faintness, to their small size, or to the
disk geometry. Faint disks are typically found around young stars and typically
host no cavity. There is a possible dichotomy in the near-IR excess of sources
with spiral-disks (high) and ring-disks (low). Like spirals, shadows are
associated with a high near-IR excess. If we account for the pre-main sequence
evolutionary timescale of stars with different mass, spiral arms are likely
associated to old disks. We also found a loose, shallow declining trend for the
disk dust mass with time. Protoplanetary disks may form sub-structures like
rings very early in their evolution but their detectability in scattered light
is limited to relatively old sources (more than 5 Myr) where the recurrently
detected disk cavities allow to illuminate the outer disk. The shallow decrease
of disk mass with time might be due to a selection effect, where disks observed
thus far in scattered light are typically massive, bright transition disks with
longer lifetime than most disks. Our study points toward spirals and shadows
being generated by planets of fraction-to-few Jupiter masses that leave their
(observed) imprint on both the inner disk near the star and the outer disk
cavity.

slotted-time protocol that prescribes the probabilities with which at a given
time-step she will attempt transmission at each channel. If more than one
players try to transmit over the same channel (collision) then no transmission
happens on that channel. Each player tries to minimize her own expected
\textit{latency}, i.e. her expected time until successful transmission, by
choosing her protocol. The natural problem that arises in such a setting is,
given $n$ and $k$, to provide the players with a common, anonymous protocol (if
it exists) such that no one would unilaterally deviate from it (equilibrium
protocol).
  All previous theoretical results on strategic contention resolution examine
only the case of a single channel and show that the equilibrium protocols
depend on the feedback that the communication system gives to the players. Here

while investigations of galaxies are still incomplete. Motivated by this point,
we use the state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulation, Illustris-1, to
investigate mainly the spin--LSS correlation of galaxies at redshift of $z=0$.
We mainly find that the spins of low-mass, blue, oblate galaxies are
preferentially aligned with the slowest collapsing direction ($e_3$) of the
large-scale tidal field, while massive, red, prolate galaxy spins tend to be
perpendicular to $e_3$. The transition from a parallel to a perpendicular trend
occurs at $\sim10^{9.4} M_{\odot}/h$ in the stellar mass, $\sim0.62$ in the g-r
color, and $\sim0.4$ in triaxiality. The transition stellar mass decreases with
increasing redshifts. The alignment was found to be primarily correlated with
the galaxy stellar mass. Our results are consistent with previous studies both
in N-body simulations and observations. Our study also fills the vacancy in the
study of the galaxy spin--LSS correlation at $z=0$ using hydrodynamical
simulations and also provides important insight to understand the formation and

First, they are computationally expensive, often requiring operations on large

various biological functions such as chemotaxis or signaling. The molecular
recognition of ligands by surface receptors is degenerate in many systems
leading to crosstalk between different receptors. Crosstalk is often thought of
as a deviation from optimal specific recognition, as the binding of non-cognate
ligands can interfere with the detection of the receptor's cognate ligand,
possibly leading to a false triggering of a downstream signaling pathway. Here
we quantify the optimal precision of sensing the concentrations of multiple
ligands by a collection of promiscuous receptors. We demonstrate that crosstalk
can improve precision in concentration sensing and discrimination tasks. To
achieve superior precision, the additional information about ligand
concentrations contained in short binding events of the non-cognate ligand

either $\text{FPP}_1$ or $\text{FPP}_\lambda$. A fundamental question in this
model, and in growth processes with competition in general, is whether the two
processes coexist (i.e., both produce infinite clusters) with positive
probability. We show that this is the case when $G$ is vertex transitive,
non-amenable and hyperbolic, in particular, for any $\lambda>0$ there is a
$\mu_0=\mu_0(G,\lambda)>0$ such that for all $\mu\in(0,\mu_0)$ the two
processes coexist with positive probability. This is the first non-trivial
instance where coexistence is established for this model. We also show that
$\text{FPP}_\lambda$ produces an infinite cluster almost surely for any
positive $\lambda,\mu$, establishing fundamental differences with the behavior
of such processes on $\mathbb{Z}^d$.

  Part IB: We compute the fractal dimension $D$ of a turbulent anti-deSitter
black brane reconstructed from boundary fluid data using the fluid-gravity

  Part II: We report progress implementing a fluid code with post-Newtonian

self-gravity, and a black hole via elliptic equations. This eliminates
radiative modes, allowing larger time steps, which is helpful for studying
systems with very long time scales, eg. tidal disruption events.

emission is consistent with the mode energy around the neutrinospheres, where
$r\sim 70$ km. Thus, neutrinos carry information about the mode in the outer

extensible provenance ingestion mechanisms to collect rich provenance and
context information, handle modifications to the same file using
distinguishable versions, and use graph data models (e.g., property graphs) and
query languages (e.g., Cypher) to represent and manipulate the stored
provenance/context information. Due to the schema-later nature of the metadata,
multiple versions of the same files, and unfamiliar artifacts introduced by
team members, the ""provenance graph"" is verbose and evolving, and hard to
understand; using standard graph query model, it is difficult to compose
queries and utilize this valuable information.
  In this paper, we propose two high-level graph query operators to address the
verboseness and evolving nature of such provenance graphs. First, we introduce
a graph segmentation operator, which queries the retrospective provenance
between a set of source vertices and a set of destination vertices via flexible
boundary criteria to help users get insight about the derivation relationships
among those vertices. We show the semantics of such a query in terms of a
context-free grammar, and develop efficient algorithms that run orders of
magnitude faster than state-of-the-art. Second, we propose a graph
summarization operator that combines similar segments together to query
prospective provenance of the underlying project. The operator allows tuning
the summary by ignoring vertex details and characterizing local structures, and
ensures the provenance meaning using path constraints. We show the optimal
summary problem is PSPACE-complete and develop effective approximation
algorithms. The operators are implemented on top of a property graph backend.
We evaluate our query methods extensively and show the effectiveness and
efficiency of the proposed methods.

different species in the gas phase in these clouds. The mechanism by which
molecules are released from the dust surface below thermal desorption
temperatures to be detectable in the gas phase is crucial for understanding the
chemical evolution in such cold clouds. Chemical desorption, caused by the
excess energy of an exothermic reaction, was first proposed as a key molecular
release mechanism almost 50 years ago. Chemical desorption can, in principle,
take place at any temperature, even below the thermal desorption temperature.
Therefore, astrochemical net- work models commonly include this process.
Although there have been a few previous experimental efforts, no infrared
measurement of the surface (which has a strong advantage to quantify chemical
desorption) has been performed. Here, we report the first infrared in situ
measurement of chemical desorption during the reactions H + H2S -> HS + H2

sulphur chemistry. The present study clearly demonstrates that chemical
desorption is a more efficient process for releasing H2S into the gas phase

desorption indicates that the chemical desorption rate exceeds the

architectures in terms of prediction accuracy, compared to the best
hand-crafted ones in literature. In addition, a very small training budget (200
evaluations and 10 epochs in training) is spent on each optimized architectures
in contrast to the usual long training time of hand-crafted networks. Moreover,
instead of the standard sequential evaluation in EGO, several candidate

  Soft-Quantization Network with Noisy-Natural Samples Only","Further improvement",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent work on adversarial attack and defense suggests that PGD is a
universal $l_\infty$ first-order attack, and PGD adversarial training can
significantly improve network robustness against a wide range of first-order
$l_\infty$-bounded attacks, represented as the state-of-the-art defense method.
However, an obvious weakness of PGD adversarial training is its
highly-computational cost in generating adversarial samples, making it
computationally infeasible for large and high-resolution real datasets such as
the ImageNet dataset. In addition, recent work also has suggested a simple
""close-form"" solution to a robust model on MNIST. Therefore, a natural question
raised is that is PGD adversarial training really necessary for robust defense?
In this paper, we give a negative answer by proposing a training paradigm that
is comparable to PGD adversarial training on several standard datasets, while
only using noisy-natural samples. Specifically, we reformulate the min-max
objective in PGD adversarial training by a problem to minimize the original
network loss plus $l_1$ norms of its gradients w.r.t. the inputs. For the
$l_1$-norm loss, we propose a computationally-feasible solution by embedding a
differentiable soft-quantization layer after the network input layer. We show
formally that the soft-quantization layer trained with noisy-natural samples is
an alternative approach to minimizing the $l_1$-gradient norms as in PGD
adversarial training. Extensive empirical evaluations on standard datasets show
that our proposed models are comparable to PGD-adversarially-trained models
under PGD and BPDA attacks. Remarkably, our method achieves a 24X speed-up on
MNIST while maintaining a comparable defensive ability, and for the first time
fine-tunes a robust Imagenet model within only two days. Code is provided on

approaches on regression or classification tasks on various kinds of data.
Other astonishing results have been achieved using neural nets as data
generators, especially in settings of generative adversarial networks (GANs).
One special application is the field of image domain translations. Here, the
goal is to take an image with a certain style (e.g. a photography) and
transform it into another one (e.g. a painting). If such a task is performed
for unpaired training examples, the corresponding GAN setting is complex, the
neural networks are large, and this leads to a high peak memory consumption
during, both, training and evaluation phase. This sets a limit to the highest
processable image size. We address this issue by the idea of not processing the
whole image at once, but to train and evaluate the domain translation on the
level of overlapping image subsamples. This new approach not only enables us to
translate high-resolution images that otherwise cannot be processed by the
neural network at once, but also allows us to work with comparably small neural
networks and with limited hardware resources. Additionally, the number of
images required for the training process is significantly reduced. We present
high-quality results on images with a total resolution of up to over 50

selection idea is adopted to adaptively approximate the differential encoding
patterns of data stream, e.g., streaming media, and iteration is avoided for
stepwise learning. Experimental results demonstrate our method is able to
provide outstanding performance, as a benchmark approach to continuous hashing.

frequently used to describe deterministic chemical kinetics at the macroscopic
scale. At the microscopic scale, the chemical kinetics is stochastic and can be
captured by complex dynamical systems reproducing spatial movements of
molecules and their collisions. Such molecular dynamics systems may implicitly
capture intricate phenomena that affect reaction rates but are not accounted
for in the macroscopic models. In this work we present a data assimilation
procedure for learning non-homogenous kinetic parameters from molecular
simulations with many simultaneously reacting species. The learned parameters
can then be plugged into the deterministic reaction rate equations to predict
long time evolution of the macroscopic system. In this way, our procedure
discovers an effective differential equation for reaction kinetics. To
demonstrate the procedure, we upscale the kinetics of a molecular system that
forms a complex covalently bonded network severely interfering with the
reaction rates. Incidentally, we report that the kinetic parameters of this
system feature a peculiar time and temperature dependences, whereas the
probability of a network strand to close a cycle follows a universal
distribution.

the crystals' periodic nanostructure, which can interfere with visible light.
This crystal structure is iridescent as the resulting color changes with the
viewing or illumination angle, which limits its use for printing or displays.
To eliminate the iridescent property, it is important to make the packing of
the colloidal nanoparticles disordered. Here, we introduce a drop-casting
method where a droplet of a water- ethanol mixture containing monodisperse
polymer-coated silica nanoparticles creates a relatively uniform and
non-iridescent deposit after the droplet evaporates completely on a heated
substrate. The uniformity is caused by a thermal Marangoni flow and fast
evaporation effects due to the heated substrate, whereas non-iridescence is the
outcome of short-range-ordered packing of nanoparticles by depletion attraction
and friction effects produced by polymer brushes. We show that the colors of
the final deposits from individual droplets remain unchanged while the viewing
angle is varied under ambient light. We expect that the coating method is
compatible with ink-jet printing and the uniformly coated self-assembled
non-iridescent nanostructures have potential for color displays using
reflection mode and other optical devices.

deploy those models in memory and communication limited scenarios. Thus,
compressing a trained model without a significant loss in performance has
become an increasingly important task. Tremendous advances has been made
recently, where the main technical building blocks are parameter pruning,
parameter sharing (quantization), and low-rank factorization. In this paper, we
propose principled approaches to improve upon the common heuristics used in
those building blocks, namely pruning and quantization.
  We first study the fundamental limit for model compression via the rate
distortion theory. We bring the rate distortion function from data compression
to model compression to quantify this fundamental limit. We prove a lower bound
for the rate distortion function and prove its achievability for linear models.
Although this achievable compression scheme is intractable in practice, this
analysis motivates a novel model compression framework. This framework provides
a new objective function in model compression, which can be applied together
with other classes of model compressor such as pruning or quantization.
Theoretically, we prove that the proposed scheme is optimal for compressing
one-hidden-layer ReLU neural networks. Empirically, we show that the proposed
scheme improves upon the baseline in the compression-accuracy tradeoff.

opened a new horizon to meet the capacity and coverage requirements foreseen in
future wireless networks. Harnessing UAVs as flying base stations (BSs) has
helped to achieve a cost-effective and on-the-go wireless network that may be
used in several scenarios such as to support disaster response and in temporary
hotspots. Despite the extensive research on the application side of UAVs, the
integration of UAVs as BSs into existing wireless networks remains an open
challenge. While UAV BSs can help to increase the area spectral efficiency, the
added network heterogeneity and BS densification may diminish the capacity
gains due to increased handover rates. In this work, we shed some light on this
tradeoff by studying a three tier network architecture consisting of macro,
small, and UAV BSs and analyze its coverage and rate performance. In
particular, we consider joint control/data and split architectures and express
the rate performance for stationary and mobile users, using an analytical
approach based on stochastic geometry. While both joint and split architectures
offer similar performance for stationary users, the numerical results suggest
the splitting of control and data plane for mobile users.

particular design idea by analyzing a series of topological circuits consisting
purely of inductors (L) and capacitors (C) connected to each other by wires to
form periodic lattices. All the examples are treated using a unifying approach
based on Lagrangians and the dynamical $H$-matrix. First, the building blocks
and permutation wiring are introduced using simple circuits in one dimension,
the SSH transmission line and a braided ladder analogous to the ice-tray model
also known as the $\pi$-flux ladder. Then, more general building blocks (loops
and stars) and wiring schemes ($m$-shifts) are introduced. The key concepts of
emergent pseudo-spin degrees of freedom and synthetic gauge fields are
discussed, and the connection to quantum lattice Hamiltonians is clarified. A
diagrammatic notation is introduced to simplify the design and presentation of
more complicated circuits. These building blocks are then used to construct
topological circuits in higher dimensions. The examples include the circuit
analog of Haldane's Chern insulator in two dimensions and quantum Hall
insulator in four dimensions featuring finite second Chern numbers. The
topological invariants and symmetry protection of the edge modes are discussed
based on the $H$-matrix.
