  Simulations","accepted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stz1152",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a new method to study the characteristic scales of collapse and
fragmentation in galactic disks. Clump formation is seeded in simulations via
controlled perturbations with a specified wavelength and velocity. These are
applied to otherwise quiet gas disks ranging from analogues of present day
spirals to gas-rich, high-redshift galaxies. The results are compared to linear
theory, turbulently perturbed disks and observations. The results reflect the
expectations of linear, non-axisymmetric theory with a finite window for growth
into a bound clump. We identify two new modes of clump formation:
rotation-driven fission and fragmentation of tidal tails, though both are
expected to rarely contribute to clump formation in observed disks. We find
that bound clumps are generally much smaller than the so-called Toomre mass.
The preferred scale for fragmentation increases with the disk gas mass but
cannot produce bound objects larger than $\sim10^9$ M$_{\odot}$. The most
likely bound clump mass increases from $3\times10^6$ in low mass disks up to
$5\times10^8$ M$_{\odot}$. We conclude that observed massive stellar and
gaseous clumps on 1 kpc scales at high redshift are most likely aggregates of
many initially distinct bound clumps.

proportional to $f$(degree(v)). We explore the effect of a change point in the
system; the dynamics are initially driven by a function f until the tree
reaches size $\tau(n) \in (0,n)$, at which point the attachment function
switches to another function, $g$, until the tree reaches size $n$. Two change
point time scales are considered, namely the standard model where $\tau(n) =
\gamma n$, and the quick big bang model where $\tau(n) = n^\gamma$, for some $0
< \gamma < 1$. In the former case, we obtain deterministic approximations for
the evolution of the empirical degree distribution (EDF) in sup-norm and use
these to devise a provably consistent non-parametric estimator for the change
point $\gamma$. In the latter case, we show that the effect of pre-change point
dynamics asymptotically vanishes in the EDF, although this effect persists in
functionals such as the maximal degree. Our proofs rely on embedding the
discrete time tree dynamics in an associated (time) inhomogeneous continuous
time branching process (CTBP). In the course of proving the above results, we
develop novel mathematical techniques to analyze both homogeneous and
inhomogeneous CTBPs and obtain rates of convergence for functionals of such

BALQ SDSS J085053.12+445122.5. SimBAL analysis yielded velocity-resolved
information about the physical conditions of the absorbing gas. We found that
the ionization parameter and column density increase, and the covering fraction
decreases as a function of velocity. The total log column density is 22.9
(22.4) [cm^-2] for solar (Z=3Z_\odot) metallicity. The outflow lies 1--3
parsecs from the central engine, consistent with the estimated location of the
torus. The mass outflow rate is 17--28 M_\odot yr^-1, the momentum flux is
consistent with L_Bol/c, and the ratio of the kinematic to bolometric
luminosity is 0.8--0.9%. The outflow velocity is similar to the escape velocity
at the absorber's location, and force multiplier analysis indicates that part
of the outflow could originate in resonance-line driving. The location near the
torus suggests that dust scattering may play a role in the acceleration,
although the lack of reddening in this UV-selected object indictes a relatively
dust-free line of sight. The low accretion rate (0.06 L_Edd) and compact
outflow suggests that SDSS~J0850+4451 might be a quasar past its era of

found that existing quantum assembly languages are either too high-level or too
restricted to support comprehensive flow control on the hardware. Also, as
observed with the quantum microinstruction set QuMIS, the quantum instruction
set architecture (QISA) design may suffer from limited scalability and
flexibility because of microarchitectural constraints. It is an open challenge
to design a scalable and flexible QISA which provides a comprehensive
abstraction of the quantum hardware.
  In this paper, we propose an executable QISA, called eQASM, that can be

single-operation-multiple-qubit execution, and a very-long-instruction-word

eQASM focuses on the assembly level to be expressive. Quantum operations are
configured at compile time instead of being defined at QISA design time. We

severely affected by the imperfect estimates and variations of the
communication link attributes used. The commonly adopted static hypothesis
testing for physical layer authentication faces significant challenges in
time-varying communication channels due to the changing propagation and
interference conditions, which are typically unknown at the design stage. To
circumvent this impediment, we propose an adaptive physical layer
authentication scheme based on machine-learning as an intelligent process to
learn and utilize the complex and time-varying environment, and hence to
improve the reliability and robustness of physical layer authentication.
Explicitly, a physical layer attribute fusion model based on a kernel machine
is designed for dealing with multiple attributes without requiring the
knowledge of their statistical properties. By modeling the physical layer
authentication as a linear system, the proposed technique directly reduces the
authentication scope from a combined N-dimensional feature space to a single
dimensional (scalar) space, hence leading to reduced authentication complexity.
By formulating the learning (training) objective of the physical layer
authentication as a convex problem, an adaptive algorithm based on kernel
least-mean-square is then proposed as an intelligent process to learn and track
the variations of multiple attributes, and therefore to enhance the
authentication performance. Both the convergence and the authentication
performance of the proposed intelligent authentication process are
theoretically analyzed. Our simulations demonstrate that our solution
significantly improves the authentication performance in time-varying
environments.

chiral anomaly, large negative magnetoresistance or Fermi arcs. Recently a new
platform to realize these fermions has been introduced based on the appearance
of a three-fold band crossing at high symmetry points of certain space groups.
These band crossings are composed of two linearly dispersed bands that are
topologically protected by a Chern number, and a at band with no topological
charge. In this paper we present a new way of inducing two kinds of Weyl
fermions, based on two- and three-fold band crossings, in the non-symmorphic
magnetic material PtFeSb. By means of density functional theory calculations
and group theory analysis we show that magnetic order can split a six-fold
degeneracy enforced by non-symmoprhic symmetry to create three-fold or two-fold
degenerate Weyl nodes. We also report on the synthesis of a related phase
potentially containing two-fold degenerate magnetic Weyl points and extend our
group theory analysis to that phase. This is the first study showing that
magnetic ordering has the potential to generate new threefold degenerate Weyl
nodes, advancing the understanding of magnetic interactions in topological
materials.

interactions between pedestrians walking in crowds has compelling relevant
applications, e.g. related to the design and safety of civil infrastructures.
In this work we study pedestrian-pedestrian interactions from observational
experimental data in diluted crowds. While in motion, pedestrians adapt their
walking paths trying to preserve mutual comfort distances and to avoid
collisions. In mathematical models this behavior is typically modeled via
""social"" interaction forces.
  Leveraging on a high-quality, high-statistics dataset - composed of few
millions of real-life trajectories acquired from state-of-the-art observational
experiments - we develop a quantitative model capable of addressing
interactions in the case of binary collision avoidance. We model interactions
in terms of both long- and short-range forces, which we superimpose to our
Langevin model for non-interacting pedestrian motion [Corbetta et al.
Phys.Rev.E 95, 032316, 2017]. The new model that we propose here features a
Langevin dynamics with ""fast"" random velocity fluctuations that are
superimposed to the ""slow"" dynamics of a hidden model variable: the ""intended""
walking path. The model is capable of reproducing relevant statistics of the
collision avoidance motion, such as the statistics of the side displacement and
of the passing speed. Rare occurrences of bumping events are also recovered.
  Furthermore, comparing with large datasets of real-life tracks involves an
additional challenge so far neglected: identifying, within a database
containing very heterogeneous conditions, only the relevant events
corresponding to binary avoidance interactions. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a novel approach based on a graph representation of pedestrian
trajectories, which allows us to operate complexity reduction for efficient
data selection.

of safe all-solid-state Li-ion batteries. With a predictive universal
structure-property relationship for fast ion conduction not well understood,
the search for new solid Li ion conductors has relied largely on
trial-and-error computational and experimental searches over the last several
decades. In this work, we perform a guided search of materials space with a
machine learning (ML)-based prediction model for material selection and density
functional theory molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) simulations for calculating ionic
conductivity. These materials are screened from over 12,000 experimentally
synthesized and characterized candidates with very diverse structures and
compositions. When compared to a random search of materials space, we find that
the ML-guided search is 2.7 times more likely to identify fast Li ion
conductors, with at least a 45x improvement in the log-average of room
temperature Li ion conductivity. The F1 score of the ML-based model is 0.50,
3.5 times better than the F1 score expected from completely random guesswork.
In a head-to-head competition against six Ph.D. students working in the field,
we find that the ML-based model doubles the F1 score of human experts in its
ability to identify fast Li-ion conductors from atomistic structure with a
thousand- fold increase in speed, clearly demonstrating the utility of this
model for the research community. All conducting materials reported here lack
transition metals and are predicted to exhibit low electronic conduction, high

paper, inspired by the physics of critical phenomena, we study a simplified
model such that the cosmological constant has two values before a transition
scale factor, $a_t$, and afterwards it becomes single-valued. We consider both
the background and perturbation data sets including CMB, BAO distances and R19

library strongly secure -- is identified. Lower and upper bounds on the strong
secrecy file rate are derived when the library has more than two files.
Achievability relies on a code design which combines wiretap coding, security
embedding codes, one-time pad keys, and coded caching. A genie-aided upper
bound, in which the transmitter is provided with user demands before placement,
establishes the converse for the two-files case. For more than two files, the
upper bound is constructed by three successive channel transformations. Our
results establish provable security guarantees against a powerful adversary
which optimizes its tapping over both phases of communication in a cache-aided
system.

Actually, we are focused on separated analytic structures, but the results
remain valid for strictly convergent analytic ones as well. A classical example
of the latter is a complete rank one valued fields with the Tate algebra of
strictly convergent power series. The algebraic case was treated in our
previous papers. Here we are going to carry over the research to the general
analytic settings. Also considered are the local rings of analytic function
germs induced by a given separated Weierstrass system, which turn out to be
excellent and regular. Several results are established as, for instance,
piecewise continuity of definable functions, several versions of the
\L{}ojasiewicz inequality, H\""{o}lder continuity of definable functions
continuous on closed bounded subsets of the affine space and curve selection
for definable sets. Likewise as before, at the center of our approach is the
closedness theorem to the effect that every projection with closed bounded
fiber is a definably closed map. It enables application of resolution of
singularities and of transformation to a normal crossing by blowing up (here
applied to the local rings of analytic function germs) in much the same way as
over locally compact ground fields. We rely on elimination of valued field
quantifiers, term structure of definable functions and b-minimal cell
decomposition, due to Cluckers--Lipshitz--Robinson, as well as on relative
quantifier elimination for ordered abelian groups, due to Cluckers--Halupczok.
Besides, other two ingredients of the proof of the closedness theorem are
existence of the limit (after finite partitioning of the domain) for a
definable function of one variable and fiber shrinking, being a relaxed version
of curve selection.

accurately describes these flat bands, interaction effects are more
conveniently incorporated in tight-binding models. We have previously shown
that no fully symmetric tight-binding model can be minimal, in the sense of
capturing just the flat bands, so extended models are unavoidable. Here, we
introduce a family of tight-binding models that capture the flat bands while
simultaneously retaining all symmetries. In particular, we construct three
concrete models with five, six, or ten bands per valley and per spin. These
models are also faithful, in that the additional degrees of freedom represent
energy bands further away from neutrality, and they serve as optimal starting
points for a controlled study of interaction effects. Furthermore, our
construction demonstrates the ""fragile topology"" of the nearly flat bands;
i.e., the obstruction to constructing exponentially localized Wannier functions
can be resolved when a particular set of trivial bands is added to the model.

core-scale magnetic field is still preferentially most parallel to the core's
minor axis and most perpendicular to the major axis. The internal and external
magnetic field directions are correlated, but the direction of integrated core
angular momentum is misaligned with the core's magnetic field, consistent with
recent observations. The ratio of rotational/total kinetic and
rotational/gravitational energies are independent of core size and consistent
in magnitude with observations. The specific angular momentum also follows the
observed relationship $L/M \propto R^{3/2}$, indicating rotation is acquired
from ambient turbulence. With typical $E_\mathrm{rot}/E_K \sim 0.1$, rotation
is not the dominant motion when cores collapse.

primary goals: to study dark energy via a wide-field imaging survey, to study
exoplanets via a microlensing survey, and to enable a guest observer program.
Here we assess the ability of the several WFIRST designs to achieve the goal of
the microlensing survey to discover a large sample of cold, low-mass exoplanets
with semimajor axes beyond roughly one AU, which are largely impossible to
detect with any other technique. We present the results of a suite of
simulations that span the full range of the proposed WFIRST architectures, from
the original design envisioned by the decadal survey, to the current design,
which utilizes a 2.4-m telescope donated to NASA. By studying such a broad
range of architectures, we are able to determine the impact of design trades on
the expected yields of detected exoplanets. In estimating the yields we take
particular care to ensure that our assumed Galactic model predicts microlensing
event rates that match observations, consider the impact that inaccuracies in
the Galactic model might have on the yields, and ensure that numerical errors
in lightcurve computations do not bias the yields for the smallest mass
exoplanets. For the nominal baseline WFIRST design and a fiducial planet mass
function, we predict that a total of ${\sim}1400$ bound exoplanets with mass
greater than ${\sim}0.1~M_{\oplus}$ should be detected, including ${\sim}200$
with mass ${\lesssim}3~M_{\oplus}$. WFIRST should have sensitivity to planets

the properties of sources detectable by both current and future

spinning BH binaries with suitable spin orientations and find that this
significantly impacts the population of sources detectable by LIGO, while this
is not the case for 3rd-generation detectors. We find that three formation
pathways, differentiated by the order of core collapse and common-envelope
phases, dominate the observed population, and that their relative importance
critically depends on the recoils imparted to BHs at birth. Our models suggest
that measurements of the ""effective-spin"" parameter $\chi_{\rm eff}$ will allow
for powerful constraints. For instance, we find that the role of spin
magnitudes and spin directions in $\chi_{\rm eff}$ can be largely disentangled,
and that the symmetry of the effective-spin distribution is a robust indicator
of the binary's formation history. Our predictions for individual spin
directions and their precessional morphologies confirm and extend early toy
models, while exploring substantially more realistic and broader sets of
initial conditions. Our main conclusion is that specific subpopulations of BH
binaries will exhibit distinctive precessional dynamics: these classes include

with blackbody emission support the idea that HD 98800 B is a massive,
optically thick ring which may still retain significant amounts of gas. The
disk detection at 5 cm is compatible with free-free emission from photoionized

polarization at 5 cm compatible with non-thermal chromospheric activity. We
propose that tidal torques from Ba-Bb and A-B have stopped the viscous

loss through photoevaporative winds. This scenario can explain the properties

the length of the dot potential. As a result, the signatures of the ABS in
measurements that couple locally to the quantum dot, e.g., tunneling
measurements, are identical to the signatures of topologically-protected MZMs,
which arise only in the topological superconducting (TS) phase of the Kitaev
chain.

(GMC) properties and the associated stellar clusters in the nearby flocculent
galaxy NGC 7793. We combine the star cluster catalog from the HST LEGUS (Legacy
ExtraGalactic UV Survey) program with the 15 parsec resolution ALMA CO(2-1)
observations. We find a strong spatial correlation between young star clusters
and GMCs such that all clusters still associated with a GMC are younger than 11
Myr and display a median age of 2 Myr. The age distribution increases gradually
as the cluster-GMC distance increases, with star clusters that are spatially
unassociated with molecular gas exhibiting a median age of 7 Myr. Thus, star
clusters are able to emerge from their natal clouds long before the timescale
required for clouds to disperse. To investigate if the hierarchy observed in
the stellar components is inherited from the GMCs, we quantify the amount of
clustering in the spatial distributions of the components and find that the
star clusters have a fractal dimension slope of $-0.35 \pm 0.03$, significantly
more clustered than the molecular cloud hierarchy with slope of $-0.18 \pm
0.04$ over the range 40-800 pc. We find, however, that the spatial clustering
becomes comparable in strength for GMCs and star clusters with slopes of
$-0.44\pm0.03$ and $-0.45\pm0.06$ respectively, when we compare massive
($>$10$^5$ M$_{\odot}$) GMCs to massive and young star clusters. This shows
that massive star clusters trace the same hierarchy as their parent GMCs, under
the assumption that the star formation efficiency is a few percent.

recently shown that old massive globular clusters may move towards the center

account for the observed gamma-ray excess. In this paper we revisit the MSP

its globular cluster system. We find that our model predicts gamma-ray emission
$\sim 2-3$ times larger than for the Milky Way, but still nearly an order of
magnitude smaller than the observed Fermi excess in the Andromeda. Our MSP

the observations we require either that Andromeda deviates significantly from
the scaling relations, or that a large part of its high-energy emission comes
from additional sources.

exploits the observation that low-volatility stocks tend to yield higher

mobility) due to the formation of small polarons. Recent experimental studies
show improved carrier mobility and conductivity by atomic dopings. We studied
the small polaron hopping mobility in pristine and doped \ce{BiVO4} by
combining Landau-Zener theory and kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulation fully
from first-principles, and investigated the effect of dopant-polaron
interactions on the mobility. We found polarons are spontaneously formed at V
in both pristine and Mo/W doped \ce{BiVO4}, which can only be described
correctly by density function theory (DFT) with the Hubbard correction (DFT+U)
or hybrid exchange-correlation functional but not local or semi-local
functionals. We found DFT+U and dielectric dependant hybrid functional (DDH)
give similar electron hopping barriers, which are also similar between the room
temperature monoclinic phase and the tetragonal phase. The calculated electron
mobility agrees well with experimental values, which is around $10^{-4}$
cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$. We found the electron polaron transport in \ce{BiVO4}
is neither fully adiabatic nor nonadiabatic, and the first and second nearest
neighbor hoppings have significantly different adiabacity in spite of similar
hopping barriers. We further computed polaron mobility in the presence of
different dopants and showed that Cr substitution of V is an electron trap
while Mo and W are ""repulsive"" centers, mainly due to the minimization of local
lattice expansion by dopants and electron polarons. The dopants with
""repulsive"" interactions to polarons are promising for mobility improvement due
to larger wavefunction overlap and delocalization of locally concentrated
polarons.

The d electrons of Ti/Zr and Co dominate the electronic transport properties of
TixZr1-xCoSbxBi1-x system. All these systems follow the empirical rule of 18
valence-electron content to bring semiconductivity in HH alloys. The
isoelectronic substitution in TiCoSb can tune the band structure by shifting
the Fermi level. This provides us lot of possibilities to get the desired band
gap values for designing thermoelectrics with high efficiency. In this study we
have showed that the isoelectronic substitution at both Ti and Sb site of
TiCoSb has very small effect for increasing the ZT values and one should go for
isoelectronic substitution at any one sites of TiCoSb HH alloys alone to
improve ZT.

series constitute a large and growing portion of the world's data. Often, this
data is collected from distributed, resource-constrained devices and
centralized at one or more servers. A key challenge in this setup is reducing
the size of the transmitted data without sacrificing its quality. Lower quality
reduces the data's utility, but smaller size enables both reduced network and
storage costs at the servers and reduced power consumption in sensing devices.
A natural solution is to compress the data at the sensing devices.
Unfortunately, existing compression algorithms either violate the memory and
latency constraints common for these devices or, as we show experimentally,
perform poorly on sensor-generated time series.
  We introduce a time series compression algorithm that achieves
state-of-the-art compression ratios while requiring less than 1KB of memory and
adding virtually no latency. This method is suitable not only for low-power
devices collecting data, but also for servers storing and querying data; in the
latter context, it can decompress at over 3GB/s in a single thread, even faster
than many algorithms with much lower compression ratios. A key component of our
method is a high-speed forecasting algorithm that can be trained online and
significantly outperforms alternatives such as delta coding.
  Extensive experiments on datasets from many domains show that these results
hold not only for sensor data but also across a wide array of other time
series.

especially those involving casting or welding. However, manual quality control
procedures are often time-consuming and error-prone. In order to meet the
growing demand for high-quality products, the use of intelligent visual
inspection systems is becoming essential in production lines. Recently,
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown outstanding performance in both
image classification and localization tasks. In this article, a system is
proposed for the identification of casting defects in X-ray images, based on
the Mask Region-based CNN architecture. The proposed defect detection system
simultaneously performs defect detection and segmentation on input images,
making it suitable for a range of defect detection tasks. It is shown that
training the network to simultaneously perform defect detection and defect
instance segmentation, results in a higher defect detection accuracy than
training on defect detection alone. Transfer learning is leveraged to reduce
the training data demands and increase the prediction accuracy of the trained
model. More specifically, the model is first trained with two large
openly-available image datasets before finetuning on a relatively small metal
casting X-ray dataset. The accuracy of the trained model exceeds state-of-the
art performance on the GRIMA database of X-ray images (GDXray) Castings dataset
and is fast enough to be used in a production setting. The system also performs
well on the GDXray Welds dataset. A number of in-depth studies are conducted to
explore how transfer learning, multi-task learning, and multi-class learning
influence the performance of the trained system.

astrophysics. A large enhancement of the [Zn/Fe] ratios of very metal-poor
stars in the Galactic halo suggests the death of short-lived massive stars,
i.e., core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), as one major site for Zn production.
Previous studies have claimed that some specific CCSNe can produce Zn in
sufficient quantities. However, it remains unclear which models can withstand
the critical test of observations. Using a Zn abundance feature similar to that
of r-process elements in faint satellite galaxies, we find evidence that Zn
production took place through much rarer events than canonical CCSNe. This
finding can be unified with the implied decrease in the rate of Zn production
with an increasing metallicity for Galactic halo stars, which narrows down the
major site of Zn production in the early galaxy to magneto-rotational SNe
(MR-SNe). On the other hand, in the later phase of galactic evolution, we
predict that the major Zn-production site switched from MR-SNe to thermonuclear
SNe (SNe Ia). According to this scenario, an accumulation of the contributions
from two types of SNe eventually led to the solar isotope composition of Zn
which mainly owes 66,68Zn to MR-SNe and 64Zn to SNe Ia triggered by
He-detonation. The requirement of Zn production in SNe Ia sheds a new light on
the hot debate on the scenario for SN Ia progenitors, suggesting that a
He-detonation model might be one major channel for SNe Ia.

j_*d ~ M_*d^alpha and j_*b ~ M_*b^alpha with alpha = 0.67 +/- 0.07 but offset
from each other by a factor of 8 +/- 2 over the mass range 8.9 <= log M_*/M_Sun
<= 11.8. Separate fits for disks and bulges alone give alpha = 0.58 +/- 0.10
and alpha = 0.83 +/- 0.16, respectively. This model correctly predicts that
galaxies follow a curved 2D surface in the 3D space of log j_*, log M_*, and
beta_*. We find no statistically significant indication that galaxies with
classical and pseudo bulges follow different relations in this space, although
some differences are permitted within the observed scatter and the inherent
uncertainties in decomposing galaxies into disks and bulges. As a byproduct of
this analysis, we show that the j_*--M_* scaling relations for disk-dominated
galaxies from several previous studies are in excellent agreement with each
other. In addition, we resolve some conflicting claims about the
beta_*-dependence of the j_*--M_* scaling relations. The results presented here
reinforce and extend our earlier suggestion that the distribution of galaxies

developed new sketch descent methods for solving general smooth linearly
constrained problems, in particular, random sketch descent and accelerated
random sketch descent methods. From our knowledge, this is the first
convergence analysis of random sketch descent algorithms for optimization
problems with multiple non-separable linear constraints. For the general case,
when the objective function is smooth and non-convex, we prove for the
non-accelerated variant sublinear rate in expectation for an appropriate
optimality measure. In the smooth convex case, we derive for both algorithms,
non-accelerated and accelerated random sketch descent, sublinear convergence
rates in the expected values of the objective function. Additionally, if the
objective function satisfies a strong convexity type condition, both algorithms
converge linearly in expectation. In special cases, where complexity bounds are
known for some particular sketching algorithms, such as coordinate descent
methods for optimization problems with a single linear coupled constraint, our
theory recovers the best-known bounds. We also show that when random sketch is
sketching the coordinate directions randomly produces better results than the
fixed selection rule. Finally, we present some numerical examples to illustrate

challenge in visual detection problems. While spatial multi-scale modeling has
been well studied in object detection, how to effectively apply a multi-scale
architecture to temporal models for activity detection is still under-explored.
In this paper, we identify three unique challenges that need to be specifically
handled for temporal activity detection compared to its spatial counterpart. To
address all these issues, we propose Dynamic Temporal Pyramid Network (DTPN), a
new activity detection framework with a multi-scale pyramidal architecture
featuring three novel designs: (1) We sample input video frames dynamically
with varying frame per seconds (FPS) to construct a natural pyramidal input for
video of an arbitrary length. (2) We design a two-branch multi-scale temporal
feature hierarchy to deal with the inherent temporal scale variation of
activity instances. (3) We further exploit the temporal context of activities
by appropriately fusing multi-scale feature maps, and demonstrate that both
local and global temporal contexts are important. By combining all these
components into a uniform network, we end up with a single-shot activity
detector involving single-pass inferencing and end-to-end training. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed DTPN achieves state-of-the-art performance
on the challenging ActvityNet dataset.

than the analogous rate in Minkowski spacetime, as a consequence of (local)
time dilation and the cosmological redshift. For $t \ll t_{nr}$ the decay law

the remaining blocks are kept invariant. Notably, each block employs a
steplength that is in accordance with its block-specific Lipschitz constant
while block-specific batch-sizes are random variables updated at a rate that
grows either at a geometric or polynomial rate with the (random) number of

surface dynamics that affect the measurements and amplify the uncertainties on
stellar parameters. The resulting motion of the stellar photo-center could have
adverse effects on the parallax determination with Gaia. Aims. We explore the
impact of the convection-related surface structure in AGBs on the photocentric
variability. We quantify these effects to characterise the observed parallax
errors and estimate fundamental stellar parameters and dynamical properties.
Methods. We use 3D radiative-hydrodynamics simulations of convection with
CO5BOLD and the post-processing radiative transfer code Optim3D to compute
intensity maps in the Gaia G band. From those maps, we calculate the
intensity-weighted mean of all emitting points tiling the visible stellar
surface and evaluate its motion as a function of time. We extract the parallax
error from Gaia DR2 for a sample of semiregular variables in the solar
neighbourhood and compare it to the synthetic predictions of photo-center
displacements. Results. AGB stars show a complex surface morphology
characterised by the presence of few large scale long-lived convective cells
accompanied by short-lived and small scale structures. As a consequence, the
position of the photo-center displays temporal excursions between 0.077 to
0.198 AU (5 to 11% of the corresponding stellar radius), depending on the
simulation considered. We show that the convection-related variability accounts
for a substantial part to the Gaia DR2 parallax error of our sample of
semiregular variables. Finally, we put in evidence for a correlation between
the mean photo-center displacement and the stellar fundamental parameters:
surface gravity, radius, and pulsation. We denote that parallax variations
could be exploited quantitatively using appropriate RHD simulations
corresponding to the observed star.

amplitude and frequency modulation, we find high-fidelity pulse sequences that
primarily drive a transverse motional mode with a wavelength of 4 ion spacings.
We present two $500 \mu s$ pulses that can in theory suppress gate errors due
to residual motion to below $10^{-4}$, and observe a trade-off between gate
power and robustness against unwanted frequency offsets.

profiles: standard Shakura-Sunyaev radiating thin discs, uniform intensity
discs and truncated discs where driving radiation is cutoff at some radius. We
find that global outflow properties depend primarily on the total system
luminosity but truncated discs can launch outflows with $\sim 2$ times higher
mass flux and $\sim 50\%$ faster outflow velocity than non-truncated discs with
the same total radiation flux. Streamlines interior to the truncation radius
are largely unaffected and carry the same momentum flux as non-truncated models
whereas those far outside the truncation radius effectively carry no outflow
because the local radiation force is too weak to lift matter vertically away
from the disc. Near the truncation radius the flow becomes more radial, due to
the loss of pressure/radiation support from gas/radiation at larger radii.
These models suggest that line driven outflows are sensitive to the geometry of
the radiation field driving them, motivating the need for self-consistent
disc/wind models.

  article)",,,,"math.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In the last two decades, increased need for high-fidelity simulations of the
time evolution and propagation of forces in granular media has spurred renewed
interest in discrete element method (DEM) modeling of frictional contact. Force
penalty methods, while economic and accessible, introduce artificial stiffness,
requiring small time steps to retain numerical stability. Optimization-based
methods, which enforce contacts geometrically through complementarity
constraints, allow the use of larger time steps at the expense of solving a
nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) each time step. We review the latest
efforts to produce solvers for this NCP, focusing on its relaxation to a cone
complementarity problem (CCP) and solution via an equivalent quadratic
optimization problem with conic constraints. We distinguish between linearly
convergent first order methods and second order methods, which gain quadratic
convergence and more robust performance at the expense of the solution of large
sparse linear systems.
  We propose a novel acceleration for the solution of Newton step linear
systems in second order methods using low-rank compression based fast direct
solvers. We use the Quantized Tensor Train (QTT) decomposition to produce
efficient approximate representations of the system matrix and its inverse.
This provides a robust framework to accelerate its solution in a direct or a
preconditioned iterative method. In a number of numerical tests, we demonstrate
that this approach displays sublinear scaling of precomputation costs, may be
efficiently updated across Newton iterations as well as across time steps, and
leads to a fast, optimal complexity solution of the Newton step. This allows
our method to gain an order of magnitude speedups over state-of-the-art
preconditioning techniques for moderate to large-scale systems, mitigating the
computational bottleneck of second order methods.

Both modules leverage hierarchical attention mechanisms that learn to promote

bottom-up manner. Although the JSFusion is a universal model to be applicable
to any multimodal sequence data, this work focuses on video-language tasks
including multimodal retrieval and video QA. We evaluate the JSFusion model in

acoustic effects, but in which long-wavelength acoustics play a nontrivial
role, present a computational challenge. Integrating the entire domain with
low-Mach-number methods would remove all acoustic wave propagation, while
integrating the entire domain with the fully compressible equations can in some
cases be prohibitively expensive due to the CFL time step constraint. For
example, simulation of thermoacoustic instabilities might require fine
resolution of the fluid/chemistry interaction but not require fine resolution
of acoustic effects, yet one does not want to neglect the long-wavelength wave
propagation and its interaction with the larger domain. The present paper
introduces a new multi-level hybrid algorithm to address these types of
phenomena. In this new approach, the fully compressible Euler equations are
solved on the entire domain, potentially with local refinement, while their
low-Mach-number counterparts are solved on subregions of the domain with higher
spatial resolution. The finest of the compressible levels communicates
inhomogeneous divergence constraints to the coarsest of the low-Mach-number
levels, allowing the low-Mach-number levels to retain the long-wavelength
acoustics. The performance of the hybrid method is shown for a series of test
cases, including results from a simulation of the aeroacoustic propagation
generated from a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in low-Mach-number mixing layers.
It is demonstrated that compared to a purely compressible approach, the hybrid
method allows time-steps two orders of magnitude larger at the finest level,
leading to an overall reduction of the computational time by a factor of 8.

ALES, comprises magnification optics, a lenslet array, and direct-vision

observing approach includes manual adjustments to filter wheel positions to
optimize alignment, on/off nodding to track sky-background variations, and
wavelength calibration using narrow band filters in series with ALES optics.
For planets with separations outside our 1""x1"" field of view, we use a
three-point nod pattern to visit the primary, secondary and sky. To minimize
overheads we select the longest exposure times and nod periods given observing
conditions, especially sky brightness and variability. Using this strategy we
collected several datasets of low-mass companions to nearby stars.

orientation constitute a standard test of galaxies formation scenarios since
observed variations in angular momentum represent fundamental constraints for
any model of galaxy formation. We have improved the method of analysis of the
alignment of galaxies in clusters. Now, the method allowed analysis both
position angles of galaxy major axes and two angles describing the spatial
orientation of galaxies. The distributions of analyzed angles were tested for
isotropy by applying different statistical tests. For sample of analyzed
clusters we have computed the mean values of analyzed statistics, checking
whether they are the same as expected ones in the case of random distribution
of analyzed angles. The detailed discussion of this method has been performed.
We have shown how to proceed in many particular cases in order to improve the
statistical reasoning when analyzing the distribution of the angles in the
observational data. Separately, we have compared these new results with those
obtained from numerical simulations. We show the powerful of our method on the
example of galaxy orientation analysis in 247 Abell rich galaxy clusters. We
have found that the orientations of galaxies in analyzed clusters are not
random. It means that we genuinely confirmed an existence of the alignment of
galaxies in rich Abells' galaxy clusters. This result is independent from the

Arches cluster to simultaneously constrain its IMF and other properties (such
as age and total mass) while accounting for observational uncertainties,
completeness, mass segregation, and stellar multiplicity. We find that the
Arches IMF is best described by a 1-segment power law that is significantly
top-heavy: $\alpha$ = 1.80 $\pm$ 0.05 (stat) $\pm$ 0.06 (sys), where dN/dm
$\propto$ m$^{-\alpha}$, though we cannot discount a 2-segment power law model

networks with a very large number of access points and user devices. A central
controller collects time-averaged traffic and channel conditions from all
access points and coordinates spectrum allocation, user association, and power
control throughout the network on an appropriate timescale. The timescale is
conceived to be seconds in today's networks, and it is likely to become faster
in the future. The coordination problem in each time epoch is formulated as a
network utility maximization problem, where any subset of access points may use
any parts of the spectrum to serve any subsets of devices. It is proved that
the network utility can be maximized by an extremely sparse spectrum
allocation. By exploiting this sparsity, an efficient iterative algorithm with
guaranteed convergence is developed, each iteration of which is performed in
closed form. The proposed centralized optimization framework can incorporate a
broad class of utility functions that account for weighted sum rates, average
packet delay, and/or energy consumption, along with very general constraints on
transmission powers. Numerical results demonstrate the feasibility of the
algorithm for networks with up to 1,000 access points and several thousand
devices. Moreover, the proposed scheme yields significantly improved throughput

schemes.

well as the distortion of the focal plane itself, cause shape distortions to
the observed objects, an effect typically known as field distortion (FD). We
point out that FD provides a unique way of quantifying the accuracy of cosmic
shear measurement. The idea is to stack the shear estimators from galaxies that
share similar FD-induced shape distortions. Given that the latter can be
calculated with parameters from astrometric calibrations, the accuracy of the
shear estimator can be directly tested on real images. It provides a way to
calibrate the multiplicative and additive shear recovery biases within the
scientific data itself, without requiring simulations or any external data
sets. We use the CFHTLenS images to demonstrate the accuracy of the
Fourier_Quad shear recovery method. We highlight some details in our image
processing pipeline, including background removal, source identification and
deblending, astrometric calibration, star selection for PSF reconstruction,
noise reduction, etc.. We show that in the shear ranges of -0.005 < g_1 < 0.005

At first glance this equation is far out of the scope of the local existence
theory available in the framework of regularity structures [Hai14, BHZ16, CH16,
BCCH17] since it involves a non-polynomial nonlinearity and the solution is
expected to be a distribution (without any additional small parameter as in
[FG17, HX18]). In [HS16] this was overcome by a change of variable, but the new
equation that arises has a multiplicative dependence on highly non-Gaussian
noises which makes stochastic estimates highly non-trivial - as a result [HS16]
was only able to treat part of the subcritical regime. Moreover, the cumulants
of these noises fall out of the scope of the later work [CH16]. In this work we
systematically leverage ""charge"" cancellations specific to this model and

the geodesic deviation, but also violates WEP in a semi-classical setting. As a

network in a supervised end-to-end manner. This may bring major limitations on
these methods because the number of such low-dose/high-dose training sinogram
pairs would affect the network's capability and sometimes the ground-truth
sinograms are hard to be obtained in large scale. Since large number of
low-dose ones are relatively easy to obtain, it should be critical to make

enhancement that incorporates unlabeled LdCT sinograms directly into the

characteristics and noise distribution in the measured LdCT sinogram, and then
learns the proper gradient of the LdCT sinogram in a pure unsupervised manner.
Similar to the labeled ground-truth, the gradient information in an unlabeled
LdCT sinogram can be used for sufficient network training. The experiments on
the patient data show effectiveness of the proposed method.

off-resonance pumps, we show that the Floquet theory works well in capturing
the softening of bimagnon excitation. By comparing the Stokes/anti-Stokes
spectra, we also show that effective heating dominates at small pump fluences,

thereby provides the platform to explore different ultrafast processes and
design material properties out of equilibrium.

studied sv from the aspect of nonlinear sigma models [1], where the gauge
physics of open string sigma model is under the Wilson loop representation but
the gauge physics of heterotic string sigma model is under the fermionic
representation since the Wilson loop representation is absent in the heterotic
case. There we showed that the sv comes from a sum of six radial orderings of
heterotic vertices on the complex plane. In this paper, we propose a Wilson
loop representation for the heterotic case and using the Wilson loop
representation to show that sv comes from a sum of two opposite-directed
contours of the heterotic sigma model. We firstly prove that the Wilson loop is
the exact propagator of the fermion field that carry the gauge physics of the
heterotic string in the fermionic representation. Then we construct the action
of the heterotic string sigma model in terms of the Wilson loop, by exploring
the geometry of the Wilson loop and by generalizing the nonabelian Stokes's
theorem [2], [3], [4] to the fermionic case. After that, we compute some three
loop and four loop diagrams as an example, to show how the sv for $\zeta_2$ and

conjecture that this sum of contours of the Wilson loop is the mechanism behind

nonsaturating linear magnetoresistance at large field. We explain these results
by considering the disordered network of electron- and hole-type puddles
induced by charged impurities. We argue theoretically that such disorder can
produce an insulator-to-metal transition as a function of increasing disorder
strength, and we derive a condition on the band gap and the impurity
concentration necessary to observe the insulating state. We also explain the
linear magnetoresistance in terms of strong spatial fluctuations of the local
conductivity, using both numerical simulations and a theoretical scaling
argument.

of $O(h^{p+s})$. Since our method yields a (multilevel) Toeplitz stiffness

imprinted in the distribution of small bodies in the outer Solar System. Here
we analyze five published Neptune migration models in detail, focusing on the
high pericenter distance (high-q) trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) near Neptune's
5:2 and 3:1 mean-motion resonances, because they have large resonant
populations, are outside the main classical belt, and are relatively isolated
from other strong resonances. We compare the observationally biased output from
these dynamical models with the detected TNOs from the Outer Solar System
Origins Survey, via its Survey Simulator. All of the four new OSSOS detections
of high-q non-resonant TNOs are on the Sunward side of the 5:2 and 3:1
resonances. We show that even after accounting for observation biases, this
asymmetric distribution cannot be drawn from a uniform distribution of TNOs at
2sigma confidence. As shown by previous work, our analysis here tentatively
confirms that the dynamical model that uses grainy slow Neptune migration
provides the best match to the real high-q TNO orbital data. However, due to
extreme observational biases, we have very few high-q TNO discoveries with
which to statistically constrain the models. Thus, this analysis provides a
framework for future comparison between the output from detailed, dynamically
classified Neptune migration simulations and the TNO discoveries from future
well-characterized surveys. We show that a deeper survey (to a limiting
r-magnitude of 26.0) with a similar survey area to OSSOS could statistically
distinguish between these five Neptune migration models.

different Co2+ (Oh), Co2+ (Td), and Co3+ (Oh) sites with constant occupancies.
According to these features, the occupancy of the Fe3+ (Oh) cations decreases

obtained a systematic increase of y with decreasing x and achieved the highest

of y and magnetization in the d range of 1.7 - 5.2 nm, a magnetically dead

nearest-neighbor distances, for the same mean composition and aging
temperature. The temporal evolution of the measured values of the mean radius,
<R(t)>, number density, aluminum supersaturations, and volume fraction of the
gamma prime(L12)-precipitates are compared to the predictions of a modified
version of the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner coarsening model due to Calderon,
Voorhees et al. The resulting experimental rate constants are used to calculate
the Gibbs interfacial free-energy between the gamma(f.c.c.)- and gamma
prime(L12)-phases using data from two thermodynamic databases, and its value is
compared to all extant values dating from 1966. The diffusion coefficient for
coarsening is calculated utilizing the same rate constants and compared to all
extant archival diffusivities, not determined from coarsening experiments, and
is demonstrated to be the inter-diffusivity, , of Ni and Al. The
monovacancy-mediated LKMC1 simulation results are in good agreement with our
3-D APT data. It is demonstrated that the compositional interfacial width, for
the {100} interface, between the gamma(f.c.c.)- and gamma prime (L12)-phases,
decreases continuously with increasing aging time and <R(t)>, for the 3-D APT
results and monovacancy-mediated LKMC1 simulations, in disagreement with an
ansatz intrinsic to the trans-interface diffusion-controlled coarsening model,
which predicts the opposite trend for binary alloys.

that nanoflares may be ubiquitous in quiet and active regions (ARs). Hard X-ray
(HXR) observations with unprecedented sensitivity $>$3~keV are now enabled by
focusing instruments. We analyzed data from the \textit{Focusing Optics X-ray
Solar Imager (FOXSI)} rocket and the \textit{Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope
Array (NuSTAR)} spacecraft to constrain properties of AR nanoflares simulated
by the EBTEL field-line-averaged hydrodynamics code. We generated model X-ray
spectra by computing differential emission measures for homogeneous nanoflare
sequences with heating amplitudes $H_0$, durations $\tau$, delay times between
events $t_N$, and filling factors $f$. The single quiescent AR observed by
\textit{FOXSI-2} on 2014 December 11 is well fit by nanoflare sequences with
heating amplitudes 0.02 erg cm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ $<$ $H_0$ $<$ 13 erg cm$^{-3}$
s$^{-1}$ and a wide range of delay times and durations. We exclude delays
between events shorter than $\sim$900 s at the 90\% confidence level for this
region. Three of five regions observed by {\nustar} on 2014 November 1 are well
fit by homogeneous nanoflare models, while two regions with higher fluxes are
not. Generally, the {\nustar} count spectra are well fit by nanoflare sequences
with smaller heating amplitudes, shorter delays, and shorter durations than the
allowed \textit{FOXSI-2} models. These apparent discrepancies are likely due to
differences in spectral coverage between the two instruments and intrinsic
differences among the regions. Steady heating ($t_N$ = $\tau$) was ruled out
with $>$99\% confidence for all regions observed by either instrument.

address these problems, question-guided kernels generated from the input

textual and visual relationship in the early stage. The question-guided
convolution can tightly couple the textual and visual information but also
introduce more parameters when learning kernels. We apply the group
convolution, which consists of question-independent kernels and
question-dependent kernels, to reduce the parameter size and alleviate
over-fitting. The hybrid convolution can generate discriminative multi-modal

proposed framework allows to exploit the multi-community social context of
users for improving the local offloading of cached content in a multihop D2D
network. To model the collaborative effect of a set of UEs on content
offloading, a cooperative game between the UEs is formulated. For this game, it
is shown that the Shapley value (SV) of each UE effectively captures the impact
of this UE on the overall content offloading process. To capture the presence
of multiple social communities that connect the UEs, a hypergraph model is
proposed. Two line graphs, an influence-weighted graph, and a
connectivity-weighted graph, are developed for analyzing the proposed hypergaph
model. Using the developed line graphs along with the SV of the cooperative
game, a precise offloading power metric is derived for each UE within a
multi-community, multi-hop D2D network. Then, UEs with high offloading power
are chosen as the optimal locations for caching the popular content. Simulation
results show that, on the average, the proposed cache placement framework

generalised Dirichlet eigenvalue problem for a coercive second order partial
differential operator with random coefficients, motivated by problems in
structural mechanics, photonic crystals and neutron diffusion. The PDE
coefficients are assumed to be uniformly bounded random fields, represented as
infinite series parametrised by uniformly distributed i.i.d. random variables.
The expectation of the fundamental eigenvalue of this problem is computed by
(a) truncating the infinite series which define the coefficients; (b)
approximating the resulting truncated problem using lowest order conforming
finite elements and a sparse matrix eigenvalue solver; and (c) approximating
the resulting finite (but high dimensional) integral by a randomly shifted
quasi-Monte Carlo lattice rule, with specially chosen generating vector. We
prove error estimates for the combined error, which depend on the truncation
dimension $s$, the finite element mesh diameter $h$, and the number of
quasi-Monte Carlo samples $N$. Under suitable regularity assumptions, our
bounds are of the particular form $\mathcal{O}(h^2+N^{-1+\delta})$, where
$\delta>0$ is arbitrary and the hidden constant is independent of the
truncation dimension, which needs to grow as $h\to 0$ and $N\to\infty$.
Although the eigenvalue problem is nonlinear, which means it is generally
considered harder than the analogous source problem, in almost all cases we
obtain error bounds that converge at the same rate as the corresponding rate
for the source problem. The proof involves a detailed study of the regularity
of the fundamental eigenvalue as a function of the random parameters. As a key
intermediate result in the analysis, we prove that the spectral gap (between
the fundamental and the second eigenvalues) is uniformly positive over all
realisations of the random problem.

decoherence theory describes the emergence of effectively classical features of
the quantum system-measuring apparatus composite system when the apparatus is
allowed to interact with the environment. In [E.A. Galapon {\it EPL} {\bf 113}
60007 (2016)], a measurement model is found to have the feature of inducing
exact decoherence at a finite time via one internal degree of freedom of the
apparatus provided that the apparatus is decomposed into a pointer and an
inaccessible probe, with the pointer and the probe being in momentum-limited
initial states. However, an issue can be raised against the model: while the
factorization method of the time evolution operator used there is formally
correct, it is not completely rigorous due to some unstated conditions on the
validity of the factorization in the Hilbert space of the model. Furthermore,
no examples were presented there in implementing the measurement scheme in
specific quantum systems. The goal of this paper is to re-examine the model and
confirm its features independently by solving the von Neumann equation for the
joint state of the composite system as a function of time. This approach
reproduces the joint state obtained in the original work, leading to the same
conditions for exact decoherence and orthogonal pointer states when the
required initial conditions on the probe and pointer are imposed. We illustrate
the exact decoherence process in the measurement of observables of a spin-1/2
particle and a quantum harmonic oscillator by using the model.

constructing the time of arrival operator for a non-relativistic and
structureless particle that is projected upward in a uniform gravitational
field with an intended arrival point below the classical turning point. The
TOA-operator is constructed under the constraint that the inertial and
gravitational masses are equivalent, and that Galilean invariance is preserved.
These constraints are implemented by Weyl-quantization of the corresponding
classical time of arrival function for the projectile. The expectation value of
the TOA-operator is explicitly shown to be equal to the classical time of
arrival plus mass-dependent quantum correction terms, implying incompatibility
of the weak equivalence principle with quantum mechanics. The full extent of
the violation of the WEP is shown through the mass dependence of time of
arrival distribution for the projectile.

alternative scenario. This paper provides a unified framework for developing
new tests which are adaptive to a large variety of alternative scenarios in
high dimensions. In particular, our framework includes arbitrary hypotheses
which can be tested using high dimensional $U$-statistic based vectors. Under
this framework, we first develop a broad family of tests based on a novel
variant of the $L_p$-norm with $p\in \{1,\dots,\infty\}$. We then combine these
tests to construct a data-adaptive test that is simultaneously powerful under
various alternative scenarios. To obtain the asymptotic distributions of these
tests, we utilize the multiplier bootstrap for $U$-statistics. In addition, we
consider the computational aspect of the bootstrap method and propose a novel
low-cost scheme. We prove the optimality of the proposed tests. Thorough
numerical results on simulated and real datasets are provided to support our
theory.

attacks, inputs with perturbations designed to intentionally trigger
misclassification. Current adversarial methods directly alter pixel colors and
evaluate against pixel norm-balls: pixel perturbations smaller than a specified
magnitude, according to a measurement norm. This evaluation, however, has
limited practical utility since perturbations in the pixel space do not
correspond to underlying real-world phenomena of image formation that lead to
them and has no security motivation attached. Pixels in natural images are
measurements of light that has interacted with the geometry of a physical
scene. As such, we propose the direct perturbation of physical parameters that
underly image formation: lighting and geometry. As such, we propose a novel
evaluation measure, parametric norm-balls, by directly perturbing physical
parameters that underly image formation. One enabling contribution we present
is a physically-based differentiable renderer that allows us to propagate pixel
gradients to the parametric space of lighting and geometry. Our approach
enables physically-based adversarial attacks, and our differentiable renderer
leverages models from the interactive rendering literature to balance the
performance and accuracy trade-offs necessary for a memory-efficient and
scalable adversarial data augmentation workflow.

analyzed in this paper with emphasis on the behavior for (nearly)

on the Taylor-Hood combination of continuous finite element spaces of
polynomial degrees $k+1$ and $k$ for the displacement and the pressure,
respectively. Our construction leads then to reconstructed stresses by
Raviart-Thomas elements of degree $k$ which are weakly symmetric in the sense
that its anti-symmetric part is zero tested against continuous piecewise
polynomial functions of degree $k$. The computation is performed locally on a
set of vertex patches covering the computational domain in the spirit of
equilibration \cite{BraSch:08}. Due to the weak symmetry constraint, the local
problems need to satisfy consistency conditions associated with all rigid body
modes, in contrast to the case of Poisson's equation where only the constant
modes are involved. The resulting error estimator is shown to constitute a
guaranteed upper bound for the error with a constant that depends only on the
shape regularity of the triangulation. Local efficiency, uniformly in the

techniques, allows enhancing the appearance coverage of the lifelong map while
keeping the map size limited. On the other hand, the latter is able to
significantly boost the appearance-based landmark selection for efficient

philosophy of simplicity, drastically limiting the number of parameters to
learn from the target datasets, always choosing the simplest earning methods:
i) transfer learning and low-dimensional space embedding allows to reduce the
dimensionality of the representations. ii) The isual temporal information is
handled by a simple score-per-frame selection process, averaged across time.
iii) A simple frame selection echanism is also proposed to weight the images of
a sequence. iv) The fusion of the different modalities is performed at
prediction level (late usion). We also highlight the inherent challenges of the
AFEW dataset and the difficulty of model selection with as few as 383

Extending a result of Brits and Raubenheimer, it is further shown that $a$ and

use of a global spectral parameter in the formula aside, the various methods of

also analyzed the contemporaneous data from Fermi-LAT to study the high energy
(HE) gamma- ray emission during the high activity state of the source. The HE
gamma- ray emission is observed to be increasing after the TeV flaring activity
detected with the TACTIC. We also use other near simultaneous archival data
available from the Swift-BAT in hard X-rays and from SPOL at Steward

experimentally with an aeroacoustic setup: a turbulent jet impinging a beer
bottle and producing a whistling tone in a finite range of jet angles and
velocities. Given a low-order model of the system, the identification analyzes
stationary time series of a single observable: acoustic pressure fluctuations
in the bottle. As this observable exhibits the characteristics of weakly
non-linear self-oscillations, we choose as a minimal model the Van der Pol
(VdP) oscillator: a linear acoustic oscillator (bottle) subject to stochastic
forcing and non-linear deterministic forcing (turbulent jet). Although very
simple, the VdP oscillator driven by random noise proves to be a sufficient
phenomenological description of the aeroacoustic limit cycle for model-based
linear growth rate identification. The associated stochastic amplitude equation
allows us to describe the stochastic fluctuations of the acoustic amplitude
resulting from a competition between (i) linear growth rate from the coherent
unsteady vortex force, (ii) random forcing from the turbulence, (iii)
non-linear saturation of the coherent flapping of the jet. Finally, the
associated adjoint Fokker-Planck equation reveals the deterministic potential
well and the stochastic forcing intensity governing these random fluctuations.
Additional experiments with an external control validate the identification
results. We observe that different operating conditions can yield similar
statistics but different dynamics, showing that the identification method can
disentangle deterministic and stochastic effects in systems forced
stochastically. This output-only identification approach can be used in a wide
range of phenomena exhibiting stationary self-sustained oscillations in the
presence of random forcing.

optimising an external field, the optimal control question turns into a
optimisation problem for the many-body initial state of the combined
matter-photon system. In the present work, we develop such a optimal control
theory for quantum electrodynamics. We derive the equation that provides the
gradient of the target function, which is often the occupation of some given
state or subspace, with respect to the control variables that define the
initial state. We choose the well-known Dicke model to study the possibilities
of this technique. In the weak coupling regime, we find that Dicke states are
the optimal matter states to reach Fock number states of the cavity mode with
large fidelity, and vice versa, that Fock number states of the photon modes are
the optimal states to reach the Dicke states. This picture does not prevail in
the strong coupling regime. We have also considered the extended case with more
than one mode. In this case, we find that increasing the number of two-level

coupling between two different optical modes. The intense mode with n (more
than 10^6 in our work) photons manifests its effect through the nonlinear
interaction strength which is proportional to its average photon-number. The
superposition state of the weak mode, which contains only a single photon, is
responsible for both the linear Hamiltonian and the scaling of the measurement
precision. By properly preparing the initial state of single photon and making
projective photon-counting measurement, the extracted classical Fisher
information (FI) can saturate the quantum FI embedded in the combined state
after coupling, which is ~ n^2 and leads to a practical precision ~ 1.2/n. Free
from the utilization of entanglement, our work paves a way to realize

solutions in all directions perpendicular to the flow are contracted, then
there exists a unique periodic orbit, which is exponentially stable and we

have had a common origin, being an example of large-scale triggered star
formation. While some features of the distribution of the interstellar medium
in the region support this interpretation, no definitive detection of an
earlier population of massive stars responsible for the triggering has been
made thus far. We have carried out observations looking for red supergiants in
the area covered by a giant shell seen in HI and CO centered on galactic
coordinates $l \sim 14^\circ 5$, $b\sim +1^\circ$ that peaks near the same
radial velocity as the bulk of the emission from both giant HII regions, which
are located along the shell. Red supergiants have ages in the range expected
for the parent association whose most massive members could have triggered the
formation of the shell and of the giant HII regions along its rim. Out of a
sample of 37 bright red stars, we identify four red supergiants that confirm
the existence of massive stars in the age range between $\sim 10$ and $\sim
30$~Myr in the area. At least three of them have Gaia DR2 parallaxes consistent
with them being at the same distance as M16 and M17. The evidence of past
massive star formation within the area of the gaseous shell lends support to
the idea that it was formed by the combined action of stellar winds and
ionizing radiation of the precursors of the current red supergiants. These
could be the remnants of a richer population, whose most massive members have
exploded already as core-collapse supernovae. The expansion of the shell
against the surrounding medium, perhaps combined with the overrun of
preexisting clouds, is thus a plausible trigger of the formation of a second
generation of stars currently responsible for the ionization of M16 and M17.

Its dispersion is due to effective hybridization with conduction states but the
bandwidth is controled by the size of the CEF splitting. Furthermore several
new indirect and direct hybridztion gaps may be identified. By solving the

and verifiable hardware. The main idea is to manage all data access via a
cluster of autonomous computation agents running inside Intel SGX enclaves.
These EConfidante agents share a secret data key which is unknown to any
external entity, including the data service administrators, thus eliminating
many opportunities for data exposure. In this paper we describe a detailed
design of the EConfidante system, its flow and how it is managed and
implemented. Our #MeToo design also uses an immutable distributed ledger which
is built using components from a Blockchain framework. We implemented a proof
of concept of our system for the #MeToo use case and analyze its security
properties and implementation details.

described the Auslander-Reiten sequences in a precovering extension closed
subcategory $\mathcal{X}\subseteq$ mod $\Phi$. If $X\in\mathcal{X}$ is an
indecomposable such that Ext$_{\Phi}^1(X,\mathcal{X})\neq 0$ and $\zeta X$ is
the unique indecomposable direct summand of the $\mathcal{X}$-cover
$g:Y\rightarrow D$Tr$X$ such that Ext$_{\Phi}^1(X,\zeta X)\neq 0$, then there
is an Auslander-Reiten sequence in $\mathcal{X}$ of the form
  \begin{align*}
  \epsilon: 0\rightarrow \zeta X\rightarrow X'\rightarrow X\rightarrow 0.
  \end{align*}
  Moreover, when End$_\Phi (X)$ modulo the morphisms factoring through a
projective is a division ring, Kleiner proved that each non-split short exact
sequence of the form
  \begin{align*}
  \delta: 0\rightarrow Y\rightarrow Y'\xrightarrow{\eta} X\rightarrow 0
  \end{align*} is such that $\eta$ is right almost split in $\mathcal{X}$, and
the pushout of $\delta$ along $g$ gives an Auslander-Reiten sequence in mod
$\Phi$ ending at $X$.
  In this paper, we give higher dimensional generalisations of this. Let $d\geq
1$ be an integer. A $d$-cluster tilting subcategory $\mathcal{F}\subseteq$ mod
$\Phi$ plays the role of a higher mod $\Phi$. Such an $\mathcal{F}$ is a
$d$-abelian category, where kernels and cokernels are replaced by complexes of
$d$ objects and short exact sequences by complexes of $d+2$ objects. We give
higher versions of the above results for an additive ""$d$-extension closed""

problem in the field of computational number theory with applications to many
other areas. The main cost of a well-known algorithm
\cite{ge1993algorithms,kauers2005algorithms} solving the problem is on
computing the primitive element of the extended field generated by the given
algebraic numbers. When the extended field is of large degree, the problem
seems intractable by the tool implementing the algorithm. In this paper, a
special kind of exponent lattice basis is introduced. An important feature of
the basis is that it can be inductively constructed, which allows us to deal
with the given algebraic numbers one by one when computing the basis. Based on
this, an effective framework for constructing exponent lattice basis is
proposed. Through computing a so-called pre-basis first and then solving some
linear Diophantine equations, the basis can be efficiently constructed. A new
certificate for multiplicative independence and some techniques for decreasing
degrees of algebraic numbers are provided to speed up the computation. The new
algorithm has been implemented with Mathematica and its effectiveness is
verified by testing various examples. Moreover, the algorithm is applied to
program verification for finding invariants of linear loops.

provides for extracted pulse widths in the millisecond range. Key operational

QARAT, which uses an attention mechanism to learn on which words and phrases to

device that forms part of a network of N such devices. In the case where the
devices in question are sources assumed to prepare identical quantum pure
states, with the faulty source producing a different anomalous pure state, we
show that the optimal probability of successful identification requires a

known unitary operation, different from the other devices, we show that the use
of entangled probes provide an improvement that even allows perfect
identification for values of the unitary parameter that surpass a certain
threshold. Finally, if the faulty device implements a known channel, when the
remaining channels implement the identity channel, we find that the optimal
probability for detecting the position of rank-one and rank-two Pauli channels
can be achieved by product state inputs and separable measurements for any size
of network, whereas for rank-three and general amplitude damping channels
optimal identification requires entanglement with N ancillas.

of a rock matrix, represents for a monitoring wavefield pronounced changes in
scattering power. In this work we introduce a rolling reference wavefield when
applying Coda-Wave Interferometry (CWI) and Coda-Wave-Decorrelation (CWD) in

demonstrate how this modification enables the qualitative monitoring of stages
in material deformation common to Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) tests.
In addition to the general stages of deformation, the precursory/subtle onset
of material yielding is identifiable in both the CWI and CWD method. It is
therefore expected that this approach will enable these coda based methods to
robustly monitor continuous, destructive processes over a variety of scales.

described by a fourth-rank effective viscosity tensor. When the tensor is
isotropic, two scalars determine the resistance: an effective shear and an
effective bulk viscosity. Here, calculations are presented of the effective
viscosity tensor during diffusion creep for a 2D tiling of hexagonal unit cells
and a 3D tessellation of tetrakaidecahedrons (truncated octahedrons). The
geometry of the melt is determined by assuming textural equilibrium. The
viscosity tensor for the 2D tiling is isotropic, but that for the 3D
tessellation is anisotropic. Two parameters control the effect of melt on the
viscosity tensor: the porosity and the dihedral angle. Calculations for both
Nabarro-Herring (volume diffusion) and Coble (surface diffusion) creep are
presented. For Nabarro-Herring creep the bulk viscosity becomes singular as the
porosity vanishes. This singularity is logarithmic, a weaker singularity than
typically assumed in geodynamic models. The presence of a small amount of melt
(0.1% porosity) causes the effective shear viscosity to approximately halve.
For Coble creep, previous modelling work has argued that a very small amount of
melt may lead to a substantial, factor of 5, drop in the shear viscosity. Here,
a much smaller, factor of 1.4, drop is obtained for tetrakaidecahedrons. Owing
to a Cauchy relation symmetry, the Coble creep bulk viscosity is a constant
multiple of the shear viscosity when melt is present.

of the system lies in a spin-disordered plaquette-valence-bond-solid phase. A
six-spin plaquette operator theory of this honeycomb model has been developed
for this purpose by using the eigenstates of an isolated Heisenberg hexagonal
plaquette. Spin-1/2 operators are thus expressed in the Fock space spanned by
the plaquette operators those are obtained in terms of exact analytic form of
eigenstates for a single frustrated Heisenberg hexagon. Ultimately, an
effective interacting boson model of this system is obtained on the basis of
low energy singlets and triplets plaquette operators by employing a mean-field

have been estimated and the validity of this formalism has been tested upon

nodes on the basis of spin-disordered ground state noted in this investigation
is very rare on any frustrated system as well as the presence of triplet flat

problem: In what sense do the Nash equilibria of $n$-player stochastic
differential games converge to the mean field game as $n\rightarrow\infty$?
Previous work on this problem took two forms. First, when the $n$-player
equilibria are open-loop, compactness arguments permit a characterization of
all limit points of $n$-player equilibria as weak MFG equilibria, which contain
additional randomness compared to the standard (strong) equilibrium concept. On
the other hand, when the $n$-player equilibria are closed-loop, the convergence
to the MFG equilibrium is known only when the MFG equilibrium is unique and the
associated ""master equation"" is solvable and sufficiently smooth. This paper
adapts the compactness arguments to the closed-loop case, proving a convergence
theorem that holds even when the MFG equilibrium is non-unique. Every limit
point of $n$-player equilibria is shown to be the same kind of weak MFG
equilibrium as in the open-loop case. Some partial results and examples are
discussed for the converse question, regarding which of the weak MFG equilibria
can arise as the limit of $n$-player (approximate) equilibria.

attached to an AFM head, forming an excellent scanning probe tip. Furthermore,
it simultaneously influences the collectible photoluminescence (PL) rate of the
NV located inside. Especially sensing protocols using continuous
optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) benefit from an enhanced
collectible PL rate, improving the achievable sensitivity. This work presents a
comprehensive set of simulations to quantify the influence of the device
geometry on the collectible PL rate for individual NVs. Besides geometric
parameters (e.g. pillar length, diameter and platform thickness), we also focus
on fabrication uncertainties such as the exact position of the NV or the taper
geometry of the pillar introduced by imperfect etching. As a last step, we use
these individual results to optimize our current device geometry, yielding a
realistic gain in collectible PL rate by a factor of 13 compared to bulk
diamond and 1.8 compared to our unoptimized devices.

Janis-Newman-Winicour (JNW) spacetimes (also known as a rotating source with a

the recent article [K. Jusufi, Phys. Rev. D 98, 064017 (2018)], we extend some
of these results by exploring the effects of naked singularity and Kerr-like
objects on the deflection of particles. We start by introducing coordinate
transformation leading to an isotropic line element which gives the refraction
index of light for the corresponding optical medias. On the other hand, the
refraction index for massive particles is found by considering those particles
as a de Broglie wave packets. To this end, we apply the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to
the isotropic optical metrics to find the deflection angles. Our analysis shows
that, in the case of the JNW spacetime the deflection angle is affected by the
parameter $0<\gamma<1$, similarly, we find that the deformation parameter
$\lambda$ affects the deflection angle in the case of Kerr-like wormholes. In
addition to that, we presented a detailed analysis of the deflection angle by
means of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation that lead to the same results. As a
special case of our results the deflection angle of light is recovered.
Finally, we point out that the deflection of particles by Kerr-like wormholes
is stronger compared to JNW spacetime, in particular this difference can be
used to shed some light from observational point of view in order to
distinguish the two spacetimes.

parameters, 3D position of points, and affine brightness parameters. Thanks to
the wide FoV, image overlap between frames becomes bigger and points are more

attribute to characterize its design structure and its ability to evolve over

However, existing tools are limited to detecting undesired dependencies once

network features to analyze the dynamics of such a structure. In particular, we
apply link prediction techniques for this task. We conducted an evaluation on
two Java projects across several versions, using link prediction and machine
learning techniques, and assessed their performance for identifying new

interschool friendship on a popular social networking site. We use data from
36,951 students from 590 schools of a large European city. We find that the
probability of a friendship tie between students from neighboring schools is
high and that it decreases with the distance between schools following the
power law. We also find that students are more likely to be connected if the
educational outcomes of their schools are similar. We show that this fact is
not a consequence of residential segregation. While high- and low-performing
schools are evenly distributed across the city, this is not the case for the
digital space, where schools turn out to be segregated by educational outcomes.
There is no significant correlation between the educational outcomes of a
school and its geographical neighbors; however, there is a strong correlation
between the educational outcomes of a school and its digital neighbors. These
results challenge the common assumption that the Internet is a borderless
space, and may have important implications for the understanding of educational
inequality in the digital age.

sensitive biomolecule from the high-energy excitations, while the vibrational

C=O stretching mode in the carboxylic acid group for 13C-enriched L-alanine
when compared with naturally occurring 12C L-alanine, which is confirmed by
macroscopic infrared spectroscopy measurements and theoretical calculations.

Griffiths rare events for the former case. It is argued that the transition in
the case of random disorder exhibits universal features that are identified by
constructing an appropriate model of intermediate spectral statistics which is
a generalization of the family of short-range plasma models. The considered
weighted short-range plasma model yields a very good agreement both for level
spacing distribution including its exponential tail and the number variance up
to tens of level spacings outperforming previously proposed models. In
particular, our model grasps the critical level statistics which arise at
disorder strength for which the inter-sample fluctuations are the strongest.
Going beyond the paradigmatic examples of many-body localization in spin
systems, we show that the considered model also grasps the level statistics of
disordered Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models. The remaining deviations for
long-range spectral correlations are discussed and attributed mainly to the
intricacies of level unfolding.

i.e. spanwise-periodic (SP) wall blowing/suction/deformation. We tackle the
global linear stability of 2D flows subject to small-amplitude 3D SP control.
Building on previous work for parallel flows (Boujo et al. 2015), an adjoint
method is proposed for computing the 2nd-order eigenvalue sensitivity. Such
control has a zero 1st-order linear effect, so the 2nd-order quadratic effect
prevails. The sensitivity operator allows one (i) to predict the effect of any
control without computing the controlled flow, (ii) to compute the optimal
control for growth rate/frequency modification. The method takes advantage of
spanwise periodicity to reduce computational complexity (from a 3D problem to a
2D one). The approach is applied to the leading eigenvalue of the laminar flow
around a circular cylinder. Two SP controls are explored: wall actuation
(blowing/suction) and wall deformation. Decomposing the eigenvalue variation,
we find that the 3D contribution (from the SP 1st-order flow modification) is
generally larger than the 2D one from the mean flow correction
(spanwise-invariant 2nd-order flow modification). The optimal control for
stabilization is top-down symmetric, leading to varicose streaks in the wake.
Analyzing the competition between amplification and stabilization shows that
optimal varicose streaks are not significantly more amplified than sinuous ones
but have a stronger stabilizing effect. The optimal wall deformation induces a
flow modification similar to that of the optimal wall actuation. In general,
spanwise and tangential actuation have a small contribution to the optimal
control, so normal-only actuation is a good trade-off between simplicity and
effectiveness. Our method opens the way to the systematic design of optimal SP
control for a variety of control objectives other than linear stability.

galaxy NGC 4634 with a projected distance of 1.4 kpc and a H$\alpha$ star
formation rate of $\sim 4.7 \times 10^{-3} \text{M}_\odot \text{yr}^{-1}$ in
order to increase our understanding of these disk-halo processes. With optical
long-slit spectra we measured fluxes of optical nebula emission lines to derive
the oxygen abundance 12 + log(O/H) of an HII region in the disk of NGC 4634 and
in the star-forming dwarf galaxy candidate. Abundances derived from optical
long-slit data and from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) r-band data, H$\alpha$
data, Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) HI data, and photometry of SDSS
and GALEX data were used for further analysis. With additional probes of the
luminosity-metallicity relation in the $B$-band from the H$\alpha$-luminosity,
the HI map, and the relative velocities, we are able to constrain a possible
origin of the dwarf galaxy candidate. The high oxygen abundance (12 + log(O/H)
$\approx$ 8.72) of the dwarf galaxy candidate leads to the conclusion that it
was formed from pre-enriched material. Analysis of auxiliary data shows that
the dwarf galaxy candidate is composed of material originating from NGC 4634.
We cannot determine whether this material has been ejected tidally or through
other processes, which makes the system highly interesting for follow up
observations.

theory might still apply. Progress towards finding macroscopic quantum states

thus providing a most general setting for extending the existence theory for

obtain a general existence result for weighted extremal metrics on admissible

no K\""ahler metrics of constant weighted scalar curvature in that class. We
also relate the positivity of the function to a notion of weighted K-stability,

image reconstruction framework that enables navigator-free, highly accelerated
multishot echo planar imaging (msEPI), and demonstrate its application in
high-resolution structural and diffusion imaging.
  Methods: Singleshot EPI is an efficient encoding technique, but does not lend
itself well to high-resolution imaging due to severe distortion artifacts and
blurring. While msEPI can mitigate these artifacts, high-quality msEPI has been
elusive because of phase mismatch arising from shot-to-shot variations which
preclude the combination of the multiple-shot data into a single image. We
employ deep learning to obtain an interim image with minimal artifacts, which
permits estimation of image phase variations due to shot-to-shot changes. These
variations are then included in a Joint Virtual Coil Sensitivity Encoding
(JVC-SENSE) reconstruction to utilize data from all shots and improve upon the
ML solution.
  Results: Our combined ML + physics approach enabled Rinplane x MultiBand (MB)
= 8x2-fold acceleration using 2 EPI-shots for multi-echo imaging, so that
whole-brain T2 and T2* parameter maps could be derived from an 8.3 sec
acquisition at 1x1x3mm3 resolution. This has also allowed high-resolution
diffusion imaging with high geometric fidelity using 5-shots at Rinplane x MB =
9x2-fold acceleration. To make these possible, we extended the state-of-the-art
MUSSELS reconstruction technique to Simultaneous MultiSlice (SMS) encoding and
used it as an input to our ML network.
  Conclusion: Combination of ML and JVC-SENSE enabled navigator-free msEPI at
higher accelerations than previously possible while using fewer shots, with
reduced vulnerability to poor generalizability and poor acceptance of
end-to-end ML approaches.

to extract values for the unfolding force as well as the friction coefficient
for the first time. In order to extract numerical values for these physical
quantities, we employ a recently introduced Bayesian inference framework. We
find that the determined unfolding force is in agreement with estimates from a
simple Flory type argument. The estimated friction coefficient is in agreement
with theoretical estimates for motion of a cylinder in a channel. We further
validate the estimated friction constant by extracting this parameter from
DNA's center-of-mass motion before and after unfolding, yielding decent
agreement.

by Classical Communication (LOCC) plays a central role in entanglement theory.
The main emphasis of these investigations is on the deterministic, or
probabilistic transformations between two states and mainly tools from linear
algebra are employed. Here, we go one step beyond that and analyze all optimal
protocols. We show that for all bipartite and almost all multipartite (of
arbitrarily many d-level systems) pairs of states, there exist infinitely many
optimal intermediate states to which the initial state can first be transformed
(locally) before it is transformed to the final state. The success probability
of this transformation is nevertheless optimal. We provide a simple
characterization of all intermediate states. We generalize this concept to
differentiable paths in Hilbert space that connect two states of interest. With
the help of survival analysis we determine the success probability for the
continuous transformation along such a path and derive necessary and sufficient
conditions on the optimality. We show, in strong contrast to previous results
on state transformations, that optimal paths are characterized as solutions of
a differential equation. Whereas, for almost all pairs of states, there exist
infinitely many optimal paths, we present examples of pairs of states for which
not even a single optimal intermediate state exists. Furthermore, we introduce
a physically motivated distance measure, the interconversion metric, and show
that (generically) any minimal geodesic with respect to the interconversion
metric is an optimal path. Moreover, we identify infinitely many easily
computable entanglement monotones for generic multipartite pure states. We show
that a given finite set of these entanglement monotones can be used to
completely characterize the entanglement contained in a generic state.

DR2
included photometry for more than 1.3 10^9 sources in G, BP, and RP. Even
though Gaia DR2 photometry is very precise, there are currently three
alternative definitions of the sensitivity curves that show significative
differences. AIMS: The aim of this paper is to improve the quality of the input
calibration data to produce new compatible definitions of the three bands and
to identify the reasons for the discrepancies between previous definitions.
METHODS: We have searched the HST archive for STIS spectra with G430L+G750L
data obtained with wide apertures and combined them with the CALSPEC library to
produce a high quality SED library of 122 stars with a broad range of colors,
including three very red stars. We have used it to compute new sensitivity
curves for G, BP, and RP using a functional analytical formalism. RESULTS: The
new curves are significantly better than the two previous attempts, REV and
WEI. For G we confirm the existence of a systematic bias in magnitude and
correct a color term present in REV. For BP we confirm the need to define two
magnitude ranges with different sensitivity curves and measure the cut between
them at G = 10.87 with a significant increase in precision. The new curves also
fit the data better than either REV or WEI. For RP we obtain a sensitivity
curve that better fits the STIS spectra and we find that the differences with
previous attempts reside in a systematic effect between ground-based and HST
spectral libraries. Additional evidence from color-color diagrams indicate that
the new sensitivity curve is more accurate. Nevertheless, there is still room
for improvement in the accuracy of the sensitivity curves because of the
current dearth of good-quality red calibrators: adding more to the sample
should be a priority before Gaia data release 3 takes place.

  Both Gaussian Elimination and Substitution may be used in a processing step,
followed by a type of brute-force approach on the kernel thus obtained.
  Our method shows that Positive instances of 1-in-3 SAT may be reduced to
significantly smaller instances of I.P.E. in the following sense. Any such
instance of $|V|$ variables and $|C|$ clauses can be polynomial-time reduced to
an instance of 0/1 Integer Programming with Equality, of size at most $2/3|V|$

  Small-Cell Wireless Networks",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Caching at base stations (BSs) is a promising approach for supporting the
tremendous traffic growth of content delivery over future small-cell wireless
networks with limited backhaul. This paper considers exploiting spatial caching
diversity (i.e., caching different subsets of popular content files at
neighboring BSs) that can greatly improve the cache hit probability, thereby
leading to a better overall system performance. A key issue in exploiting
spatial caching diversity is that the cached content may not be located at the
nearest BS, which means that to access such content, a user needs to overcome
strong interference from the nearby BSs; this significantly limits the gain of
spatial caching diversity. In this paper, we consider a joint design of
frequency reuse and caching, such that the benefit of an improved cache hit
probability induced by spatial caching diversity and the benefit of
interference coordination induced by frequency reuse can be achieved
simultaneously. We obtain a closed-form characterization of the approximate
successful transmission probability for the proposed scheme and analyze the
impact of key operating parameters on the performance. We design a
low-complexity algorithm to optimize the frequency reuse factor and the cache
storage allocation. Simulations show that the proposed scheme achieves a higher
successful transmission probability than existing caching schemes.

complicated probability density functions. It is based on progressive
processing for smoothly morphing a given density into the desired one.
Distributed ordinary differential equations (DODEs) with an artificial time
$\gamma \in [0,1]$ are derived for describing the evolution from the initial
density to the desired final density. For a finite-dimensional parametrization,
the DODEs are converted to a system of ordinary differential equations (SODEs),
which are solved for $\gamma \in [0,1]$ and return the desired result for
$\gamma=1$. This includes parametric representations such as Gaussians or
Gaussian mixtures and nonparametric setups such as sample sets. In the latter
case, we obtain a particle flow between the two densities along the artificial
time.
  FLUX is applied to state estimation in stochastic nonlinear dynamic systems
by gradual inclusion of measurement information. The proposed approximation
method (1) is fast, (2) can be applied to arbitrary nonlinear systems and is
not limited to additive noise, (3) allows for target densities that are only
known at certain points, (4) does not require optimization, (5) does not
require the solution of partial differential equations, and (6) works with
standard procedures for solving SODEs. This manuscript is limited to the
one-dimensional case and a fixed number of parameters during the progression.
Future extensions will include consideration of higher dimensions and on the

Here we present a class of numerical methods of arbitrary order for Hamiltonian

described. In this paper we present an overview of positive ion production in

efficiency of H+ ion production in recently developed RF sources with
solenoidal antennas was improved to 2.9 mA/kW. About 24 kW of RF power is
typically needed for 70 mA beam current production from a 7 mm emission
aperture. This efficiency is relatively low because in the RF discharge with a
solenoidal antenna, the plasma is generated near the coil and diffuses to the
axis creating a nearly uniform plasma density distribution in all cross
sections of the discharge chamber, when the plasma flow is necessary only near
an emission aperture. The efficiency of the extracted ion generation was
improved significantly by using a saddle antenna with solenoidal magnetic
field. In the RF discharge with the saddle antenna the plasma is generated near
the axis and the magnetic field suppress the plasma diffusion from the axis,
creating a peaked plasma density distribution on the emission aperture. With
the SA the efficiency of positive ion generation in the plasma has been
improved up to ~100 mA/cm2 per kW of RF power at 13.56 MHz. Continuous wave
(CW) operation of the RF source has been tested on the small ORNL SNS test
stand. The general design of the CW RF source is based on the pulsed version. A
compact design of ion source is presented. Some modifications were made to
improve the cooling and to simplify the design. Features of SA RF discharges

achieved using two parameters: roll angle and fitted disparity value with
respect to each row. To achieve a better processing efficiency, golden section
search and dynamic programming are utilised to estimate the roll angle and the
fitted disparity value, respectively. By performing a rotation around the
estimated roll angle, the disparity distribution of each row becomes very
compact. This further improves the accuracy of the road model estimation, as
demonstrated by the various experimental results in this paper. Finally, the
Otsu's thresholding method is applied to the transformed disparity map and the

quantum gates, we only use the simplest and experimentally accessible control
over the qubit states of the involved quantum systems, without introducing any

Meanwhile, this simple implementation can be conveniently generalized to a
composite scenario, which can further suppress the systematic error during the
gate operations. In addition, universal nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates in
decoherence-free subspace can also be realized based on the tunable coupling
between only two transmon qubits, without consulting to multiple qubits and
only using two physical qubits to encode a logical qubit. Therefore, our
proposal provides a promising way of high-fidelity geometric manipulation for

anomalous velocity features highlighting the complexity of the interacting M81
triplet. We compare our data with Green Bank Telescope (GBT) observations of
the same area. This provides evidence for a substantial reservoir of low-column
density gas in the northern part of the triplet, probably associated with M82.
Such a reservoir is not found in the southern part. We report a number of
kpc-sized low-mass HI clouds with HI masses of a few times 10^6 Msun. Their
dynamical masses are much larger than their baryonic masses, which could
indicate the presence of dark matter if the clouds are rotationally supported.
However, due to their spatial and kinematical association with HI tidal
features, it is more likely that the velocity widths indicate tidal effects or
streaming motions. We do not find any clouds not associated with tidal features
down to an HI mass limit of a few times 10^4 Msun. We compare the HI column
densities with resolved stellar density maps and find a star formation
threshold around 3-6 10^20 cm-2$. We find that extreme velocity dispersions can
be explained by a superposition of multiple components along the line of sight
near M81 as well as winds or outflows around M82. The velocity dispersions
found are high enough that these processes could explain the linewidths of
Damped-Lyman-alpha absorbers observed at high redshift.

involve the mobility of group members. Here we use an agent-based model of
imitative learning to study the influence of the mobility of the agents on the
time they require to find the global maxima of NK-fitness landscapes. The
agents cooperate by exchanging information on their fitness and use this
information to copy the fittest agent in their influence neighborhoods, which
are determined by face-to-face interaction networks. The influence
neighborhoods are variable since the agents perform random walks in a
two-dimensional space. We find that mobility is slightly harmful for solving
easy problems, i.e. problems that do not exhibit suboptimal solutions or local
maxima. For difficult problems, however, mobility can prevent the imitative
search being trapped in suboptimal solutions and guarantees a better
performance than the independent search for any system size.

obtaining a high Key Performance Indicator (KPI) can be challenging. A large
body of work on this subject has already been performed and platforms known as
DSPs are available on the market that deal with such an optimization. From the
advertiser's point of view, each DSP is a different black box, with its pros
and cons, that needs to be configured. In order to take advantage of the pros
of every DSP, advertisers are well-advised to use a combination of them when
setting up their campaigns. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for
advertisers to add an optimization layer on top of DSPs. The algorithm we
introduce, called SKOTT, maximizes the chosen KPI by optimally configuring the
DSPs and putting them in competition with each other. SKOTT is a highly
specialized iterative algorithm loosely based on gradient descent that is made
up of three independent sub-routines, each dealing with a different problem:
partitioning the budget, setting the desired average bid, and preventing
under-delivery. In particular, one of the novelties of our approach lies in our
taking the perspective of the advertisers rather than the DSPs. Synthetic
market data is used to evaluate the efficiency of SKOTT against other
state-of-the-art approaches adapted from similar problems. The results
illustrate the benefits of our proposals, which greatly outperforms the other
methods.

exploit a matrix signal-flow graph approach to analyze probability-generating

that of the uncoded baseline scheme for ARQ, developed by Ausavapattanakun and
Nosratinia, we demonstrate that CF ARQ can provide significantly less average

We also outline the benefits of CF ARQ under burst errors and asymmetric
channel conditions. The protocol is more predictable across statistics, hence
is more stable. This can help design robust systems when feedback is
unreliable. This feature may be preferable for meeting the strict end-to-end
latency and reliability requirements of future use cases of ultra-reliable
low-latency communications in 5G, such as mission-critical communications and

essential for better management in the region. The objective of the present
study is to develop insight into some key characteristics of the regulatory
mechanism for lantana spread inside RTR. Lantana mapping was carried out by
field observations along multiple transects and plots and the data generated
was used as input for MaxEnt modelling to identify land patches in the study
area that are favourable for lantana growth. The patch information so obtained
is integrated with a raster map generated by identifying different
topographical features in the study area which are favourable for lantana
growth. The integrated data is analysed with a complex network perspective,
where relatively dense potential lantana distribution patches are considered as
vertices, connected by relatively sparse lantana continuities, identified as
edges. The network centrality analysis reveal key patches in the study area
that play specialized roles in the spread of lantana in a large region. Hubs in
the lantana network are primarily identified as dry seasonal river beds and
their management is proposed as a vital strategy to contain lantana invasion.
The lantana network is found to exhibit small-world architecture with a well
formed community structure. We infer that the above properties of the lantana
network have major contribution in regulating the rapid infestation and even
spread of the plant through the entire region of study.

computationally intensive and difficult to scale. To this end, specialized
FPGA-based accelerators have been repeatedly proposed to ameliorate this
problem. However, to date none of the leading MD simulation packages fully
support FPGA acceleration and a direct comparison of GPU versus FPGA
accelerated codes has remained elusive so far. With this report, we aim at
clarifying this issue by comparing measured application performance on

single- node system. Our results show that an FPGA-based system can indeed
outperform a similarly configured GPU-based system, but the overall
application-level speedup remains in the order of 2x due to software overheads

GPU-based solutions provide the better cost/performance tradeoff, and hence
pure FPGA-based solutions are likely not going to be commercially viable.

users are then able to cooperate on different levels, such as in cooperative
intention detection for advanced VRU protection. Smart devices can be used to
detect intentions, e.g., an occluded cyclist intending to cross the road, to
warn vehicles of VRUs, and prevent potential collisions. This article presents
a human activity recognition approach to detect the starting movement of
cyclists wearing smart devices. We propose a novel two-stage feature selection
procedure using a score specialized for robust starting detection reducing the
false positive detections and leading to understandable and interpretable
features. The detection is modelled as a classification problem and realized by
means of a machine learning classifier. We introduce an auxiliary class, that
models starting movements and allows to integrate early movement indicators,
i.e., body part movements indicating future behaviour. In this way we improve
the robustness and reduce the detection time of the classifier. Our empirical
studies with real-world data originating from experiments which involve 49 test
subjects and consists of 84 starting motions show that we are able to detect
the starting movements early. Our approach reaches an F1-score of 67 % within
0.33 s after the first movement of the bicycle wheel. Investigations concerning
the device wearing location show that for devices worn in the trouser pocket
the detector has less false detections and detects starting movements faster on

participants, who exchange information about their current state, e.g.,
position, their predicted intentions, allowing to act in a cooperative manner.
Vulnerable road users (VRUs), e.g., pedestrians and cyclists, will be equipped
with smart device that can be used to detect their intentions and transmit
these detected intention to approaching cars such that their drivers can be
warned. In this article, we focus on detecting the initial movement of cyclist
using smart devices. Smart devices provide the necessary sensors, namely
accelerometer and gyroscope, and therefore pose an excellent instrument to
detect movement transitions (e.g., waiting to moving) fast. Convolutional
Neural Networks prove to be the state-of-the-art solution for many problems
with an ever increasing range of applications. Therefore, we model the initial
movement detection as a classification problem. In terms of Organic Computing
(OC) it be seen as a step towards self-awareness and self-adaptation. We apply
residual network architectures to the task of detecting the initial starting
movement of cyclists.

frequency response functions, this paper studies the frequency response
function of the creep compliance that is coined the complex creep function.
While for any physically realizable viscoelastic model the Fourier transform of
the creep compliance diverges in the classical sense, the paper shows that the
complex creep function, in spite of exhibiting strong singularities, it can be
constructed with the calculus of generalized functions. The mathematical
expressions of the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier transform of the
creep compliance of simple rheological networks derived in this paper are shown
to be Hilbert pairs; therefore, returning back in the time domain a causal
creep compliance. The paper proceeds by showing how a measured creep compliance
of a solid-like or a fluid-like viscoelastic material can be decomposed into
elementary functions with parameters that can be identified from best fit of
experimental data. The proposed technique allows for a direct determination of
the parameters of the corresponding viscoelastic models and leads to dependable
expressions of their complex-frequency response functions.

Identification and Verification of Political Claims, with focus on Task 1:
Check-Worthiness. The task asks to predict which claims in a political debate
should be prioritized for fact-checking. In particular, given a debate or a
political speech, the goal was to produce a ranked list of its sentences based
on their worthiness for fact checking. We offered the task in both English and
Arabic, based on debates from the 2016 US Presidential Campaign, as well as on
some speeches during and after the campaign. A total of 30 teams registered to
participate in the Lab and seven teams actually submitted systems for Task~1.
The most successful approaches used by the participants relied on recurrent and
multi-layer neural networks, as well as on combinations of distributional
representations, on matchings claims' vocabulary against lexicons, and on
measures of syntactic dependency. The best systems achieved mean average
precision of 0.18 and 0.15 on the English and on the Arabic test datasets,
respectively. This leaves large room for further improvement, and thus we
release all datasets and the scoring scripts, which should enable further
research in check-worthiness estimation.

dc power and I2C-formatted data are simultaneously transferred to tiny sensor
nodes distributed on a double-sided conductive textile. The textile has two
conductive sides isolated from each other and is used as a single planar
transmission line. I2C data are transferred along with dc power supply based on
frequency division multiplexing (FDM). Two carriers are modulated with the
clock (SCL) and the data (SDA) signals of I2C. A modulation and demodulation
circuit is designed to enable using off-the-shelf I2C-interfaced sensor ICs.
One significant originality of this work is that a special filter to enable
passive modulation is designed by locating its impedance poles and zeros at
appropriate frequencies. The proposed scheme enables flexible implementation of
wearable sensor systems in which multiple off-the-shelf tiny sensors are
distributed all over a wear.

the stored data is large and its download time is not negligible. We focus on
quasi-uniform storage allocations and provide a service rate analysis for two

assumption that the download time does not scale with the size of data, where
the minimal spreading allocation was previously found to be universally
optimal.
