are expected, as well as the onset of substantial radiative corrections. Here
we identify the important role played by the collision angle in mitigating

emission of the molecules towards a variety of interstellar environments is
indeed very useful to advance in our understanding of the chemical evolution of
the Galaxy, and hence of the physical processes related to the chemistry. It is
necessary to increase the sample of molecular clouds, located at different
distances, in which the behavior of molecular abundance ratios, such as the
13CO/C18O ratio (X), is studied in detail. We selected the well-studied
high-mass star-forming region G29.96-0.02, located at a distance of about 6.2
kpc, which is an ideal laboratory to perform this kind of studies. To study the
X towards this region it was used 12CO J=3-2 data obtained from COHRS, 13CO and
C18O J=3-2 data from CHIMPS, and 13CO and C18O J=2-1 data retrieved from the
CDS database (observed with the IRAM 30m telescope). The distribution of column
densities and X throughout the molecular cloud was studied based on LTE and
non-LTE methods. Values of X between 1.5 to 10.5, with an average of 5, were
found, showing that, besides the dependency between X and the galactocentric
distance, the local physical conditions may strongly affect this abundance
ratio. We found that correlating the X map with the location of the ionized gas
and dark clouds allows us to suggest in which regions the far-UV radiation
stalls in dense gaseous components, and in which ones it escapes and
selectively photodissociates the C18O isotope. The non-LTE analysis shows that
the molecular gas has very different physical conditions, not only spatially
across the cloud, but also along the line of sight. This kind of studies may
represent a tool to indirectly estimate (from molecular lines observations) the
degree of photodissociation in molecular clouds, which is indeed useful to
study the chemistry in the interstellar medium.

technique in sparse subspace clustering (SSC) by replacing the $\ell_1$
minimization with a generalization called Ordered Weighted $\ell_1$ (OWL)
minimization which performs simultaneous regression and clustering of
correlated variables. Using random geometric graph theory, we prove that OWL
regression selects more points within each subspace, resulting in better
clustering results. This allows for accurate subspace clustering based on
regression solutions for only a small subset of the total dataset,
significantly reducing the computational complexity compared to SSC. In

using mid-IR color colors from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)
catalog. This paper presents the results of optical spectroscopy of obscured
AGN candidates using Keck DEIMOS, and their physical properties derived from
these spectra. We find that a $W1-W2>0.8$ color criterion effectively selects
AGNs with a higher median level of $E(B-V)$ extinction compared to the AGNs
found in the SDSS DR7 survey. This optical extinction can be measured using SED
modeling or by using $r-W1$ as a measure of optical to IR flux. We find that

such as mechanical properties and protein activity. We address here how phase
behaviour is affected by passive phospholipid \textit{flip-flop}, such that the
compositional asymmetry is not fixed. We predict transitions from ""pre
flip-flop"" behaviour to a restricted set of phase equilibria that can persist
in the presence of passive flip-flop. Surprisingly, such states are not
necessarily symmetric. We further account for external symmetry-breaking, such
as a preferential substrate interaction, and show how this can stabilise
strongly asymmetric equilibrium states. Our theory explains several
experimental observations of flip-flop mediated changes in phase behaviour, and
shows how domain formation and compositional asymmetry can be controlled in
concert, by manipulating passive flip-flop rates and applying external fields.

an electrically focus-tunable lens onto a sample, which is positioned at a
fixed distance from the lens and makes an angle with respect to the optical
axis. Due to EFTL has the capability to vary its focal distance over a specific
range when an electric current is applied to it. The electrically focus-tunable
lens varies its focal distance as a function of an applied electric current
over a specific range thus, when light is focused on the surface of the sample
the beam intensity is high enough to generate nonlinear optical effects such as
changes in the refractive index of the material. This changes are then register
as variations in reflectance, measured by an intensity detector. Results for
three-dimensional CH3NH3PbBr3 hybrid perovskite thin films are presented.

soft and hard attention for learning latent variable alignment models, with
tighter approximation bounds based on amortized variational inference. We
further propose methods for reducing the variance of gradients to make these

Spectre attacks leverage speculative loads which circumvent access checks to
read memory-resident secrets, transmitting them to an attacker using cache
timing or other covert communication channels.
  We introduce Spectre1.1, a new Spectre-v1 variant that leverages speculative
stores to create speculative buffer overflows. Much like classic buffer
overflows, speculative out-of-bounds stores can modify data and code pointers.
Data-value attacks can bypass some Spectre-v1 mitigations, either directly or
by redirecting control flow. Control-flow attacks enable arbitrary speculative
code execution, which can bypass fence instructions and all other software
mitigations for previous speculative-execution attacks. It is easy to construct
return-oriented-programming (ROP) gadgets that can be used to build alternative
attack payloads.
  We also present Spectre1.2: on CPUs that do not enforce read/write
protections, speculative stores can overwrite read-only data and code pointers
to breach sandboxes.
  We highlight new risks posed by these vulnerabilities, discuss possible
software mitigations, and sketch microarchitectural mechanisms that could serve
as hardware defenses. We have not yet evaluated the performance impact of our
proposed software and hardware mitigations. We describe the salient

the path, architects know where to arrange the basic elements (e.g. structures,

model built by using a Markov Decision Process. The model simulates human
mental states, target range detection, and collision prediction when agents are
on the floor, in a particular small gallery, looking at an exhibit, or leaving

different transition probabilities. A modified weighted A* search algorithm
quickly plans the sub-optimal path of the agents. In an experiment, SimArch
takes a series of preprocessed floorplans as inputs, simulates the moving path,
and outputs a density map for evaluation. The density map provides the
prediction that how likely a person will occur in a location. A following

all archimedean places. In this paper, we show that the second moment of the

particular, we prove that, for any positive real number $r\leq \log_2 5 =
2.3219 \ldots$, the $r$-th moment of the number of $S$-integral points is
bounded for the family of all integral short Weierstrass curves ordered by
height, or for any positive density subfamily thereof. For certain other
families of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$, such as those with one or two
marked points, we prove that the average of the number of integral points is
bounded; in fact, for the family with one marked point, the $r$-th moment is
also bounded for all positive $r\leq \log_2 3$.
  The essential new ingredient in our proof is an upper bound on the number of
$S$-integral points on an affine integral Weierstrass model $\mathcal{E}$ of an
elliptic curve $E$ over $K$ depending on the rank of the curve, the class group
and degree of $K$, and the number of primes of $K$ whose square divides the
discriminant of $\mathcal{E}$. For example, over $\mathbb{Q}$, the bound for
integral points on $\mathcal{E}$ is $2^{\mathrm{rank}{E(\mathbb{Q})}} O(1)^s$,
where $s$ is the number of prime squares dividing the discriminant of
$\mathcal{E}$.
  The theorems on moments then follow from averaging this new upper bound;
crucially, we can bound the average of the $2^{\mathrm{rank}}$ term by using
results on the average sizes of Selmer groups in the families. In order to
prove the bounds for the $r$-th moment when $r= \log_2 5$ (and the analogous
equality cases for the other families), we introduce a method to count orbits
of coregular representations with possibly unbounded weights.

experiments for customary neutralino DM candidate, we augment the NMSSM with
Type-I seesaw mechanism, which is the simplest extension of the theory to
predict neutrino mass, and study the scenarios of sneutrino DM. We construct
likelihood function with LHC Higgs data, B-physics measurements, DM relic
density and its direct and indirect search limits, and perform a comprehensive
scan over the parameter space of the theory by Nested Sampling method. We adopt
both Bayesian and frequentist statistical quantities to illustrate the favored
parameter space of the scenarios, the DM annihilation mechanism as well as the
features of DM-nucleon scattering. We find that the scenarios are viable over
broad parameter regions, especially the Higgsino mass $\mu$ can be below about
$250 {\rm GeV}$ for a significant part of the region, which predicts $Z$ boson
mass in a natural way. We also find that the DM usually co-annihilated with the
Higgsinos to get the measured relic density, and consequently the DM-nucleon
scattering rate is naturally suppressed to coincide with the recent XENON-1T
results even for light Higgsinos. Other issues, such as the LHC search for the

manually right before harvest by extrapolation, which mostly is
labor-intensive, destructive and inaccurate. In the present study an automated
image-based workflow was developed quantifying inflorescences and single
flowers in unprepared field images of grapevines, i.e. no artificial background
or light was applied. It is a novel approach for non-invasive, inexpensive and
objective phenotyping with high-throughput.
  First, image regions depicting inflorescences were identified and localized.
This was done by segmenting the images into the classes ""inflorescence"" and
""non-inflorescence"" using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN). Efficient image
segmentation hereby is the most challenging step regarding the small geometry
and dense distribution of flowers (several hundred flowers per inflorescence),
similar color of all plant organs in the fore- and background as well as the
circumstance that only approximately 5% of an image show inflorescences. The
trained FCN achieved a mean Intersection Over Union (IOU) of 87.6% on the test
data set. Finally, individual flowers were extracted from the
""inflorescence""-areas using Circular Hough Transform. The flower extraction
achieved a recall of 80.3% and a precision of 70.7% using the segmentation
derived by the trained FCN model.
  Summarized, the presented approach is a promising strategy in order to
predict yield potential automatically in the earliest stage of grapevine
development which is applicable for objective monitoring and evaluations of
breeding material, genetic repositories or commercial vineyards.

$R\sim 50$ resolution. These composite SEDs show a variety of spectral shapes
and also show trends in parameters such as color, mass, star formation rate,
and emission line equivalent width. Using emission line equivalent widths and
strength of the 4000\AA\ break, $D(4000)$, we categorize the composite SEDs
into five classes: extreme emission line, star-forming, transitioning,
post-starburst, and quiescent galaxies. The transitioning population of
galaxies show modest H$\alpha$ emission ($EW_{\rm REST}\sim40$\AA) compared to
more typical star-forming composite SEDs at $\log_{10}(M/M_\odot)\sim10.5$
($EW_{\rm REST}\sim80$\AA). Together with their smaller sizes (3 kpc vs. 4 kpc)
and higher S\'ersic indices (2.7 vs. 1.5), this indicates that morphological
changes initiate before the cessation of star formation. The transitional group
shows a strong increase of over one dex in number density from $z\sim3$ to
$z\sim1$, similar to the growth in the quiescent population, while
post-starburst galaxies become rarer at $z\lesssim1.5$. We calculate average
quenching timescales of 1.6 Gyr at $z\sim1.5$ and 0.9 Gyr at $z\sim2.5$ and
conclude that a fast quenching mechanism producing post-starbursts dominated

enhancement to the nuclear burning rate leads in turn to supersonic burning and
a detonation front. As a result, turbulence plays a key role in preconditioning

reconstruct the history of the Galaxy by only using stellar chemical
abundances. Different studies have undertaken this analysis and they raised
several challenges.
  Aims. Using a sample of open clusters stars, we wish to address two issues:
minimize chemical abundance differences which origin is linked to the
evolutionary stage of the stars and not their original composition; evaluate a
phylogenetic approach to group stars based on their chemical composition.
  Methods. We derived differential chemical abundances for 207 stars (belonging
to 34 open clusters) using the Sun as reference star (classical approach) and a
dwarf plus a giant star from the open cluster M67 as reference (new approach).
These abundances were then used to perform two phylogenetic analyses,
cladistics (Maximum Parsimony) and Neighbour-Joining, together with a
partitioning unsupervised classification analysis with k-means. The resulting
groupings were finally confronted to the true open cluster memberships of the
stars.
  Results. We successfully reconstruct most of the original open clusters when
carefully selecting a subset of the abundances derived differentially with
respect to M67. We find a set of eight chemical elements that yields the best
result, and discuss the possible reasons for them to be good tracers of the
history of the Galaxy.
  Conclusions. Our study shows that unraveling the history of the Galaxy by
only using stellar chemical abundances is greatly improved provided that i) we
perform a differential spectroscopic analysis with respect to an open cluster
instead of the Sun, ii) select the chemical elements that are good tracers of
the history of the Galaxy, and iii) use tools that are adapted to detect
evolutionary tracks such as phylogenetic approaches.

optical, and radio counterparts located 10 kpc away from the nucleus of the
galaxy NGC 5252. Optical spectroscopic studies indicate that the ULX is
kinematically associated with NGC 5252; yet, the compactness of its radio
emission could not rule out the possibility that the ULX is a background
blazar. We present follow-up VLBA radio observations that are able to resolve
the compact radio emission of the ULX into two components, making the blazar
scenario very unlikely. The east component is extended at 4.4 GHz and its
detection also at 7.6 GHz reveals a steep spectral index. The west component is
only detected at 4.4 GHz, is not firmly resolved, and has a flatter spectral
index. Considering that the west component hosts the radio core, we constrain
the black hole mass of the ULX to $10^{3.5} < M_\mathrm{BH} \lesssim 2 \times
10^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$ and its Eddington ratio to $\sim 10^{-3}$. The ULX is thus
most likely powered by an intermediate-mass black hole or low-mass AGN. Our
results constitute the first discovery of a multi-component radio jet in a ULX
and possible intermediate-mass black hole.

efficient search of strong-lensing (SL) regions in wide-field surveys, applied
to the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). By using only
the photometric information of the brightest elliptical galaxies distributed
over a wide redshift range ($\smash{0.2 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.9}$) and without
requiring the identification of arcs, our algorithm produces lensing potential
models and catalogs of critical curves of the entire survey area. We explore
several parameter set configurations in order to test the efficiency of our
approach. In a specific configuration, $EasyCritics$ generates only $\sim1200$
possibly super-critical regions in the CFHTLS area, drastically reducing the
effective area for inspection from $154$ sq. deg to $\sim0.623$ sq. deg, $i.e.$
by more than two orders of magnitude. Among the pre-selected SL regions, we
identify 32 of the 44 previously known lenses on the group and cluster scale,
and discover 9 new promising lens candidates. The detection rate can be easily
improved to $\sim82\%$ by a simple modification in the parameter set, but at
the expense of increasing the total number of possible SL candidates. Note that
$EasyCritics$ is fully complementary to other arc-finders since we characterize
lenses instead of directly identifying arcs. Although future comparisons
against numerical simulations are required for fully assessing the efficiency
of $EasyCritics$, the algorithm seems very promising for upcoming surveys
covering $\smash{10^{4}}$ sq. deg, such as the $Euclid$ mission and $LSST$,
where the pre-selection of candidates for any kind of SL analysis will be
indispensable due to the expected enormous data volume.

by comparing with halo masses inferred from observations. Galaxies at high
redshift in the models are in lower mass haloes than suggested by observations,
and the star formation efficiency in low-mass haloes is higher than observed.

high-angular-resolution, spatially-resolved infrared ($1-2.4$ $\mu$m)
spectroscopy of four objects within a two-arcminute field-of-regard by taking
advantage of multi-object adaptive optics. This capability does not currently
exist anywhere in the world and therefore offers significant scientific gains

current programs for high redshift galaxies are pushing the limits of what is
possible with infrared spectroscopy at $8-10$-meter class facilities by
requiring up to several nights of observing time per target. Therefore, the
observation of multiple objects simultaneously with adaptive optics is
absolutely necessary to make effective use of telescope time and obtain
statistically significant samples for high redshift science. With an expected
commissioning date of 2023, GIRMOS's capabilities will also make it a key
followup instrument for the James Webb Space Telescope when it is launched in

progenitors of four Type Ia remnants with associated Balmer filaments: SN 1006,
0509-67.5, 0519-69.0, and DEM L71. For SN 1006, existing observations of helium
line emission in the diffuse emission ahead of the shock provide an additional
constraint on the helium ionization state in the vicinity of the remnant. Using
the photoionization code Cloudy, we show that these constraints exclude any
hot, luminous progenitor for SN 1006, including stably hydrogen or helium
nuclear-burning white dwarfs, as well as any Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf
accreting matter at $\gtrsim 9.5\times10^{-8}M_{\odot}/$yr via a disk. For
0509-67.5, the Balmer emission alone rules out any such white dwarf accreting
$\gtrsim 1.4\times10^{-8}M_{\odot}/$yr. For 0519-69.0 and DEM L71, the inferred
ambient ionization state of hydrogen is only weakly in tension with a recently
hot, luminous progenitor, and cannot be distinguished from e.g., a relatively
higher local Lyman continuum background, without additional line measurements.
Future deep spectroscopic observations will resolve this ambiguity, and can
either detect the influence of any luminous progenitor or rule out the same for
all resolved SN Ia remnants.

order in the strong coupling, a jet produced at an EIC is initiated as an
energetic quark, and the process of this quark splitting into a quark-gluon
system underlies experimental observables. The spectrum of gluons associated
with the branching of this quark jet is heavily modified by multiple scattering
in a medium, allowing jet cross sections and jet substructure to be used as a

compute the gluon spectrum of a quark jet to an arbitrary order in opacity, the
average number of scatterings in the medium. This calculation goes beyond the
simplifying limit in which the gluon radiation is soft and can be interpreted
as energy loss of the quark, and it significantly extends previous work which
computes the full gluon spectrum only to first order in opacity. The
theoretical framework demonstrated here applies equally well to light parton

density patterns closely resembling diffraction patterns in the Fresnel region
for small times and the same in Fraunhofer region for large times. Using the

measurement of the optical depth to reionization, both through their imprint on
the large angular scale correlations in the polarization of the cosmic
microwave background (CMB), has created the need for high sensitivity
measurements of polarization across large fractions of the sky at millimeter
wavelengths. These measurements are subject to instrumental and atmospheric
$1/f$ noise, which has motivated the development of polarization modulators to
facilitate the rejection of these large systematic effects.
  Variable-delay polarization modulators (VPMs) are used in the Cosmology Large
Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS) telescopes as the first element in the optical
chain to rapidly modulate the incoming polarization. VPMs consist of a linearly
polarizing wire grid in front of a movable flat mirror. Varying the distance
between the grid and the mirror produces a changing phase shift between
polarization states parallel and perpendicular to the grid which modulates
Stokes U (linear polarization at $45^\circ$) and Stokes V (circular
polarization). The CLASS telescopes have VPMs as the first optical element from
the sky; this simultaneously allows a lock-in style polarization measurement
and the separation of sky polarization from any instrumental polarization
further along in the optical path. The Q-band CLASS VPM was the first VPM to
begin observing the CMB full time, starting in the Spring of 2016. The first
W-band CLASS VPM was installed in the Spring of 2018.

progenitor evolution through the Super-AGB phase. As evolution proceeds during
the WD cooling phase, a crystallization process resulting from Coulomb
interactions in very dense plasmas is expected to occur, leading to the
formation of a highly crystallized core. Pulsating ultra-massive WDs offer a
unique opportunity to infer and test the occurrence of crystallization in WD
interiors as well as physical processes related with dense plasmas. We aim to
assess the adiabatic pulsation properties of ultra-massive DA WD with ONe
cores. We studied the pulsation properties of ultra-massive DA WD stars with
ONe cores. We employed a new set of ultra-massive WD evolutionary sequences of
models with stellar masses in the range 1.10 $\leq M_{star}/M_{sun} \leq$ 1.29
computed by taking into account the complete evolution of the progenitor stars
and the WD stage. When crystallization set on in our models, we took into
account latent heat release and also the expected changes in the core chemical
composition that are due to phase separation according to a phase diagram
suitable for O and Ne plasmas. We computed nonradial pulsation g-modes of our
sequences of models at the ZZ Ceti phase by taking into account a solid core.
We explored the impact of crystallization on their pulsation properties, in
particular, the structure of the period spectrum and the distribution of the
period spacings. We find that it would be possible, in principle, to discern
whether a WD has a nucleus made of CO or a nucleus of ONe by studying the
spacing between periods. The features found in the period-spacing diagrams
could be used as a seismological tool to discern the core composition of
ultra-massive ZZ Ceti stars, something that should be complemented with
detailed asteroseismic analysis using the individual observed periods.

state with each new data point, and have long been the de facto choice for
sequence modeling tasks. However, their inherently sequential computation makes
them slow to train. Feed-forward and convolutional architectures have recently
been shown to achieve superior results on some sequence modeling tasks such as
machine translation, with the added advantage that they concurrently process
all inputs in the sequence, leading to easy parallelization and faster training
times. Despite these successes, however, popular feed-forward sequence models
like the Transformer fail to generalize in many simple tasks that recurrent
models handle with ease, e.g. copying strings or even simple logical inference
when the string or formula lengths exceed those observed at training time. We
propose the Universal Transformer (UT), a parallel-in-time self-attentive
recurrent sequence model which can be cast as a generalization of the
Transformer model and which addresses these issues. UTs combine the
parallelizability and global receptive field of feed-forward sequence models
like the Transformer with the recurrent inductive bias of RNNs. We also add a
dynamic per-position halting mechanism and find that it improves accuracy on
several tasks. In contrast to the standard Transformer, under certain
assumptions, UTs can be shown to be Turing-complete. Our experiments show that
UTs outperform standard Transformers on a wide range of algorithmic and
language understanding tasks, including the challenging LAMBADA language
modeling task where UTs achieve a new state of the art, and machine translation
where UTs achieve a 0.9 BLEU improvement over Transformers on the WMT14 En-De

brightest HII region in the Local Group and a prototype starburst similar to
those found in high redshift galaxies. It is thus a stepping stone to
understand the complex formation processes of stars in starburst regions across
the Universe. Here, we have studied the formation history of massive stars in
30 Dor using masses and ages derived for 452 mainly OB stars from the
spectroscopic VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey (VFTS). We find that stars of all
ages and masses are scattered throughout 30 Dor. This is remarkable because it
implies that massive stars either moved large distances or formed independently
over the whole field of view in relative isolation. We find that both channels
contribute to the 30 Dor massive star population. Massive star formation
rapidly accelerated about 8 Myr ago, first forming stars in the field before
giving birth to the stellar populations in NGC 2060 and NGC 2070. The R136 star
cluster in NGC 2070 formed last and, since then, about 1 Myr ago, star
formation seems to be diminished with some continuing in the surroundings of
R136. Massive stars within a projected distance of 8 pc of R136 are not coeval
but show an age range of up to 6 Myr. Our mass distributions are well populated
up to $200\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. The inferred IMF is shallower than a
Salpeter-like IMF and appears to be the same across 30 Dor. By comparing our
sample of stars to stellar models in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, we find
evidence for missing physics in the models above $\log L/\mathrm{L}_\odot=6$
that is likely connected to enhanced wind mass loss for stars approaching the
Eddington limit. [abridged]

These sources form via two-body relaxation, by exchanging energy and angular

range of frequencies is localised in the range of millihertz in the case of MBH
of masses $\sim 10^6\,M_{\odot}$, i.e. that of space-borne gravitational-wave
observatories such as LISA. In this article I show that, depending on their
orbital parameters, intermediate-mass ratios (IMRIs) of MBH of masses between a
hundred and a few thousand have frequencies that make them detectable (i) with
ground-based observatories, or (ii) with both LISA and ground-based ones such
as advanced LIGO/Virgo and third generation ones, with ET as an example. The
binaries have a signal-to-noise ratio large enough to ensure detection. More
extreme values in their orbital parameters correspond to systems detectable
only with ground-based detectors and enter the LIGO/Virgo band in particular in
many different harmonics for masses up to some $2000,\,M_{\odot}$. I show that
environmental effects are negligible, so that the source should not have this
kind of complication. The accumulated phase-shift is measurable with LISA and
ET, and for some cases also with LIGO, so that it is possible to recover
information about the eccentricity and formation scenario. For IMRIs with a
total mass $\lessapprox 2000\,M_{\odot}$ and initial eccentricities up to
$0.999$, LISA can give a warning to ground-based detectors with enough time in

the Higgs boson in the diphoton decay channel are performed using the data set
of proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} =$ 13 TeV collected by the CMS
experiment at the LHC in 2016 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
35.9 fb$^{-1}$. The cross sections are measured in a fiducial phase space
defined by a set of requirements on the isolation and kinematic variables of
the photons. Differential cross sections are measured as functions of the
kinematic properties of the diphoton system and the event. A subset of the
measurements is performed in subregions of the fiducial phase space, where
relative contributions of specific Higgs boson production mechanisms are
enhanced. The total cross section in the chosen fiducial phase space is
measured to be 84 $\pm$ 11 (stat) $\pm$ 7 (syst) fb = 84 $\pm$ 13 fb, to be
compared with a theoretical prediction of 73 $\pm$ 4 fb. All measurements are
found to be in agreement with the theoretical predictions for the standard
model Higgs boson with a mass of 125.09 GeV within the experimental and
theoretical uncertainties.

in $\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})$ time. For the range least frequent problem, we address
two variations. In the first, we are allowed to answer with an element of $A$

fails for certain inputs but succeeds for others. This becomes especially
difficult if the fault is caused by an interaction of multiple inputs. To debug
such interaction faults, it is necessary to understand the individual effect of
the input, how these inputs interact and how these interactions cause the
fault. The differences between two execution traces can explain why one input
behaves differently than the other. We propose to compare execution traces of
all input options to derive explanations of the behavior of all options and
interactions among them. To make the relevant information stand out, we
represent them as variational traces that concisely represents control-flow and
data-flow differences among multiple concrete traces. While variational traces
can be obtained from brute-force execution of all relevant inputs, we use
variational execution to scale the generation of variational traces to the
exponential space of possible inputs. We further provide an Eclipse plugin
Varviz that enables users to use variational traces for debugging and
navigation. In a user study, we show that users of variational traces are more
than twice as fast to finish debugging tasks than users of the standard Eclipse
debugger. We further show that variational traces can be scaled to programs

circuits, where coherent current flows not only can offer a new insight into

hence allow for a viable implementation of cold-atom based devices and qubit

We show that the competition among interactions, intra- and inter-ring hopping

depend also on the (in)commensurate filling of the atoms. Our analysis, carried
out within a simple analytical framework and by means of the exact numerical
diagonalization of the system Hamiltonian, provides one with a rather complete
characterization of the static properties of the two-ring ladder, including,

Facility Location problem, considering an intrinsic scenario when the clients
and facilities are not only allowed to arrive to the system, but they can also
depart at any moment.
  We begin with the study of a natural fully-dynamic online uncapacitated model
where clients can be both added and removed. When a client arrives, then it has
to be assigned either to an existing facility or to a new facility opened at
the client's location. However, when a client who has been also one of the open
facilities is to be removed, then our model has to allow to reconnect all
clients that have been connected to that removed facility. In this model, we
present an optimal O(log n_act / log log n_act)-competitive algorithm, where
n_act is the number of active clients at the end of the input sequence.
  Next, we turn our attention to the capacitated Facility Location problem. We
first note that if no deletions are allowed, then one can achieve an optimal
competitive ratio of O(log n/ log log n), where n is the length of the
sequence. However, when deletions are allowed, the capacitated version of the
problem is significantly more challenging than the uncapacitated one. We show
that still, using a more sophisticated algorithmic approach, one can obtain an
online O(log m + log c log n)-competitive algorithm for the capacitated
Facility Location problem in the fully dynamic model, where m is number of
points in the input metric and c is the capacity of any open facility.

SiV centers separate in two clusters: one group exhibits ZPLs with center

circumbinary gas disc and a super massive black hole binary (SMBHB) is a
promising mechanism to drive the migration of SMBHBs toward coalescence. The
typical dynamical evolution can be separated in two main regimes: I) Slow
migration ($T_{\rm mig}$ $\sim$ $10^{3-4}\times T_{\rm orb}$), where viscous
torques are not efficient enough to redistribute the extracted angular momentum
from the binary, leading to the formation of a low density cavity around the
binary. II) Fast migration ($T_{\rm mig}$ $\sim$ $10^{1-2} \times T_{\rm
orb}$), in which the redistribution of angular momentum is efficient and no low
density cavity is formed in the circumbinary disc. Using N-Body/SPH simulations
we study the effect of AGN feedback in this phase of a SMBHB evolution. We
implement an AGN feedback model in the SPH code Gadget-3 that includes momentum
feedback from winds, X-ray heating/radial-momentum and Eddington force. Using
this implementation we run a set of simulations of SMBHB+disc in the two main
shrinking regimes. From these simulations we conclude that the effect of the
AGN mechanical feedback is negligible for SMBHBs in the slowly shrinking
regime. However, in the fast shrinking regime the AGN wind excavate a ""feedback
cavity"" leaving the SMBHB almost naked, thus stalling the orbital decay of the
binary.

this paper, we consider the problem of computing rankings for Katz centrality.
In particular, we propose upper and lower bounds on the Katz score of a given

to compute Katz centrality rankings, we construct an algorithm that iteratively
improves those upper and lower bounds until a correct Katz ranking is obtained.
We extend our algorithm to dynamic graphs while maintaining its correctness

Through frequent merging of features from branches at distinct scales, our

approach demonstrates improvement of model efficiency and performance on both
object recognition and speech recognition tasks,using popular architectures
including ResNet and ResNeXt. For object recognition, our approach reduces
computation by 33% on object recognition while improving accuracy with 0.9%.
Furthermore, our model surpasses state-of-the-art CNN acceleration approaches
by a large margin in accuracy and FLOPs reduction. On the task of speech

used to measure the properties of particles with kinetic energies that range
from a fraction of 1 eV to 10^20 eV or more. These properties are not
necessarily limited to the energy carried by these particles, but may concern
the entire four-vector, including the particle mass and type. In many modern
experiments, large calorimeter systems play a central role, and this is
expected to be no different for experiments that are currently being
planned/designed for future accelerators. In this paper, the state of the art
as well as new developments in calorimetry are reviewed. The latter are of
course inspired by the perceived demands of future experiments, and/or the
increasing demands of the current generation of experiments, as these are
confronted with, for example, increased luminosity. These demands depend on the
particles to be detected by the calorimeter. In electromagnetic calorimeters,
radiation hardness of the detector components is a major concern. The generally
poor performance of the current generation of hadron calorimeters is considered
inadequate for future experiments, and a lot of the R&D in the past decade has
focused on improving this performance. The root causes of the problems are
investigated and different methods that have been exploited to remedy this
situation are evaluated. The use of calorimetric methods to detect energy
deposits at the Joule level in astrophysics experiments and at the (sub-)eV

that upon approaching the Mott phase from the overdoped side, the charge
fluctuations at wave vectors connecting hot spots are suppressed much faster
than at the other wave-vectors. It leads to a momentum dependence of the
dressed charge susceptibility that is very different from either the bare
susceptibility or from the susceptibility obtained from the random phase
approximation. We also find that the paramagnetic lightly hole-doped Mott phase
at finite-temperature is unstable to charge ordering only at zero wave-vector,
confirming the results previously obtained from the compressibility. Charge
order is driven by the frequency-dependent scattering processes that induce an
attractive particle-hole interaction at large interaction strength and small

and aggressive lane changing/merging, is known to contribute to transportation
crashes. To fully understand driving volatility with the intention of reducing
it, the objective of this study is to identify its key correlates, while
focusing on highly volatile trips. First, a measure of driving volatility based
on vehicle speed is applied to trip data collected in the California Household
Travel Survey during 2012-2013. Specifically, the trips containing driving
cycles (N=62839 trips) were analyzed to obtain driving volatility. Second,
correlations of volatility with the trip, vehicle, and person level variables
were quantified using Ordinary Least Squares and quantile regression models.
The results of the 90th percentile regression (which distinguishes the 10%
highly volatile trips from the rest) show that trips taken by pickup trucks,
hatchbacks, convertibles, and minivans are less volatile when compared to the
trips taken by sedans. Moreover, longer trips have less driving volatility. In
addition, younger drivers are more volatile drivers than old ones. Overall, the
results of this study are reasonable and beneficial in identifying correlates
of driving volatility, especially in terms of understanding factors that
differentiate highly volatile trips from other trips. Reductions in driving
volatility have positive implications for transportation safety. From a
methodological standpoint, this study is an example of how to extract useful
(volatility) information from raw vehicle speed data and use it to calm down
drivers and ultimately improve transportation safety.

measures the accretion rate, is also known to be related with outflow and
emission-line properties in the general quasar population. Moreover, models
describing quasar accretion depend on $\lambda_{Edd}$, which can thus possibly
affect the relative production of accelerating UV and ionizing EUV/X-ray
radiation. In this work, for the first time, we investigated whether BALQSO
X-ray properties are related with the Eddington ratio. We selected a sample of

RCNN classifier trained with the synthetic dataset, we used real-world data
from the High cadence Transient Survey (HiTS) obtaining an average recall of
85%, improved to 94% after performing fine tuning with 10 real samples per
class. We compare the results of our model with those of a light curve random
forest classifier. The proposed RCNN with fine tuning has a similar performance
on the HiTS dataset compared to the light curve classifier, trained on an
augmented training set with 10 real samples per class. The RCNN approach
presents several advantages in an alert stream classification scenario, such as
a reduction of the data pre-processing, faster online evaluation and easier
performance improvement using a few real data samples. These results encourage
us to use this method for alert brokers systems that will process alert streams
generated by new telescopes such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.

functions are defined. Generative adversarial nets (GANs) present a minimax
framework to train such models, which however can suffer from mode collapse due
to the nature of the JS-divergence. This paper presents a learning by teaching
(LBT) approach to learning implicit models, which intrinsically avoids the mode
collapse problem by optimizing a KL-divergence rather than the JS-divergence in
GANs. In LBT, an auxiliary density estimator is introduced to fit the implicit
model's distribution while the implicit model teaches the density estimator to
match the data distribution. LBT is formulated as a bilevel optimization
problem, whose optimal generator matches the true data distribution. LBT can be
naturally integrated with GANs to derive a hybrid LBT-GAN that enjoys
complimentary benefits. Finally, we present a stochastic gradient ascent

paper, we propose a novel stylized image captioning model that effectively
takes both requirements into consideration. To this end, we first devise a new
variant of LSTM, named style-factual LSTM, as the building block of our model.
It uses two groups of matrices to capture the factual and stylized knowledge,
respectively, and automatically learns the word-level weights of the two groups
based on previous context. In addition, when we train the model to capture
stylized elements, we propose an adaptive learning approach based on a
reference factual model, it provides factual knowledge to the model as the
model learns from stylized caption labels, and can adaptively compute how much

image captioning datasets, which contain humorous/romantic captions and

control the differential patterns of gene regulation. DeepDiff uses a hierarchy
of multiple Long short-term memory (LSTM) modules to encode the spatial
structure of input signals and to model how various histone modifications
cooperate automatically. We introduce and train two levels of attention jointly
with the target prediction, enabling DeepDiff to attend differentially to
relevant modifications and to locate important genome positions for each
modification. Additionally, DeepDiff introduces a novel deep-learning based
multi-task formulation to use the cell-type-specific gene expression
predictions as auxiliary tasks, encouraging richer feature embeddings in our
primary task of differential expression prediction. Using data from Roadmap

DeepDiff significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines for

the response of the lymphangions to dynamically varying wall shear stress is
characterized in isolated rat thoracic ducts in relation to their shear
sensitivity. The critical shear stress above which the thoracic duct shows
substantial inhibition of contraction was found to be significantly negatively
correlated to the diameter of the lymphangion. The entrainment of the
lymphangion to an applied oscillatory shear stress was found to be
significantly dependent on the difference between the applied frequency and
intrinsic frequency of contraction of the lymphangion. The strength of
entrainment was also positively correlated to the applied shear stress when
this shear was below the critical shear stress. The results suggest an
adaptation of the lymphangion contractility to the existing oscillatory
mechanical shear stress as a function of its intrinsic contractility and shear
sensitivity. These adaptations might be crucial to ensure synchronized
contraction of adjacent lymphangions through mechanosensitive means and might
help explain the lymphatic dysfunctions that result from impaired

hub models composed of geometrically simple, canonical bluff body shapes. The
models consisted of a 4-arm rotor mounted on a shaft above a 2-arm (scissor)
rotor with all the rotor arms having a rectangular cross section. The relative
phase between the 2- and 4-arm rotors was either $0\deg$ (in-phase) or $45\deg$
(out-of-phase). The rotors were oriented at zero angle-of-attack and rotated at
30 Hz. Their wakes were measured with particle-image-velocimetry within a water
tunnel at a hub diameter based Reynolds number of $820,000$ and an advance
ratio of $0.2$. Mean profiles, fluctuating profiles and spectral analysis using
time-series analysis as well as dynamic mode decomposition were used to
characterize the wake and identify coherent structures associated with specific
frequency content. The canonical geometry produced coherent structures that
were consistent with previous results using more complex geometries. It was
shown that the dominant structures (2 and 4 times per hub revolution) decay
slowly and were not sensitive to the relative phase between the rotors.
Conversely, the next strongest structure (6 times per hub revolution) was
sensitive to the relative phase with almost no coherence observed for the
in-phase model. This is strong evidence that the 6 per revolution content is a
nonlinear interaction between the 2 and 4 revolution structures. This study
demonstrates that the far wake region is dominated by the main rotor arms wake,
the scissor rotor wake and interactions between these two features.

processes in the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB), type Ia supernova explosions

the interest in these white dwarfs, there are few evolutionary studies in the
literature devoted to them. Here, we present new ultra-massive white dwarf
evolutionary sequences that constitute an improvement over previous ones. In
these new sequences, we take into account for the first time the process of
phase separation expected during the crystallization stage of these white
dwarfs, by relying on the most up-to-date phase diagram of dense oxygen/neon
mixtures. Realistic chemical profiles resulting from the full computation of
progenitor evolution during the semidegenerate carbon burning along the
super-AGB phase are also considered in our sequences. Outer boundary conditions
for our evolving models are provided by detailed non-gray white dwarf model
atmospheres for hydrogen and helium composition. We assessed the impact of all
these improvements on the evolutionary properties of ultra-massive white
dwarfs, providing up-dated evolutionary sequences for these stars. We conclude
that crystallization is expected to affect the majority of the massive white
dwarfs observed with effective temperatures below $40\,000\, \rm K$. Moreover,
the calculation of the phase separation process induced by crystallization is
necessary to accurately determine the cooling age and the mass-radius relation
of massive white dwarfs. We also provide colors in the GAIA photometric bands

Preprint",,,,"physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Rebinding kinetics of molecular ligands plays a critical role in
biomachinery, from regulatory networks to protein transcription, and is also a
key factor for designing drugs and high-precision biosensors.In this study, we
investigate initial release and rebinding of ligands to their binding sites
grafted on a planar surface, a situation commonly observed in single molecule
experiments and which occurs during exocytosis in vivo. Via scaling arguments
and molecular dynamic simulations, we analyze the dependence of non-equilibrium
rebinding kinetics on two intrinsic length scales: average separation distance
between the binding sites and dimensions of diffusion volume (e.g., height of
the experimental reservoir in which diffusion takes place or average distance
between receptor-bearing surfaces). We obtain time-dependent scaling laws for
on rates and for the cumulative number of rebinding events for various regimes.
Our analyses reveal that, for diffusion-limited cases, the on rate decreases
via multiple power law regimes prior to the terminal steady-state regime, in
which the on rate becomes constant. At intermediate times, at which particle
density has not yet become uniform throughout the reservoir, the number of
rebindings exhibits a distinct plateau regime due to the three dimensional
escape process of ligands from their binding sites. The duration of this regime
depends on the average separation distance between binding sites. Following the
three-dimensional diffusive escape process, a one-dimensional diffusive regime
describes on rates. In the reaction-limited scenario, ligands with higher
affinity to their binding sites delay the power laws. Our results can be useful
for extracting hidden time scales in experiments where kinetic rates for
ligand-receptor interactions are measured in microchannels, as well as for cell
signaling via diffusing molecules.

coupled to any other through a central bus resonator. Although it is generally
believed that the extra frequency tunability enhances the control freedom but
induces more dephasing impact for superconducting qubits, our results show that
any individual qubit can be dynamically decoupled from dephasing noise by
applying a weak continuous and resonant driving field whose phase is reversed
in the middle of the pulse. More importantly, we demonstrate a new method for
realizing two-qubit phase gate with inherent dynamical decoupling via the
combination of continuous driving and qubit-qubit swapping coupling. We find
that the weak continuous driving fields not only enable the conditional
dynamics essential for quantum information processing, but also protect both
qubits from dephasing during the gate operation.

growth of Nb3Sn on the Nb substrate is found and four types of orientation
relationships at the Nb3Sn/Nb interface are identified by electron diffraction

Thin Nb3Sn grains are observed in regions with low Sn flux and they have the
specific orientation relationship, Nb3Sn (1-20)//Nb (-111) and Nb3Sn (002)//Nb
(0-11). The Nb3Sn/Nb interface of thin grains had a large lattice mismatch,
12.3 at.%, and a high density of misfit dislocations was observed by HR-STEM.
Based on our microstructural analysis of the thin grains, we conclude that the
thin regions are probably a result of a slow interfacial reaction with this
particular orientation relationship at the interface. The Sn-deficient regions
are seen to form initially at the Nb3Sn/Nb interface and remain in the grains
due to the slow diffusion of Sn in bulk Nb3Sn. The formation of Sn-deficient
regions and the effects of strain and interfacial energies on the formation of
Sn-deficient regions at various interfaces were also estimated by
first-principle calculation. The finding of orientation relationships at the
Nb3Sn/Nb interface provides important information about the formation of
defects in Nb3Sn coatings such as large thin regions, Sn-deficient regions,

evaluation methods make it possible to determine if two algorithms can make
recommendations with a significant difference in their average surprise
measure, it could be of interest to our community to know how competent an
algorithm is at embedding surprise in its recommendations, without having to
resort to making a direct comparison with another algorithm. We argue that a)
surprise is a finite resource in a recommender system, b) there is a limit to
how much surprise any algorithm can embed in a recommendation, and c) this
limit can provide us with a scale against which the performance of any
algorithm can be measured. By exploring these ideas, it is possible to define
the concepts of maximum and minimum potential surprise and design a surprise
metric called ""normalised surprise"" that employs these limits to potential
surprise. Two experiments were conducted to test the proposed metric. The aim
of the first was to validate the quality of the estimates of minimum and
maximum potential surprise produced by a greedy algorithm. The purpose of the
second experiment was to analyse the behaviour of the proposed metric using the

showed that the proposed surprise metric is both effective and consistent for

majority voting technique over several machine learning techniques. The
contribution of this work is in two folds: firstly it selects those features of
speech which is most promising for classification and secondly it uses the
majority voting technique that selects the exact class of emotion. Here,
majority voting technique has been applied over Neural Network (NN), Decision
Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). Input
vector of NN, DT, SVM and KNN consists of various acoustic and prosodic
features like Pitch, Mel-Frequency Cepstral coefficients etc. From speech
signal many feature have been extracted and only promising features have been
selected. To consider a feature as promising, Fast Correlation based feature
selection (FCBF) and Fisher score algorithms have been used and only those
features are selected which are highly ranked by both of them. The proposed
approach has been tested on Berlin dataset of emotional speech [3] and
Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA) dataset [4]. The experimental result shows
that majority voting technique attains better accuracy over individual machine
learning techniques. The employment of the proposed approach can effectively
recognize the emotion of human beings in case of social robot, intelligent chat
client, call-center of a company etc.

decoding algorithms fall short in providing a good error-correction performance
for RM and polar codes. Using the symmetric group of RM and polar codes, the
specific decoding algorithm can be carried out on multiple permutations of the
factor graph to boost the error-correction performance. However, this approach
results in high decoding complexity. In this paper, we first derive the total
number of factor graph permutations on which the decoding can be performed. We
further propose a successive permutation (SP) scheme which finds the
permutations on the fly, thus the decoding always progresses on a single factor

unaltered. Our results for RM and polar codes of length $128$ and rate $0.5$

limitations, specifically in dense and congested vehicular networks. The idea
of model-based communication (MBC) has been recently proposed to address this
issue. In this work, we propose Gaussian Process-based Stochastic Hybrid System
with Cumulative Relevant History (CRH-GP-SHS) framework, which is a
hierarchical stochastic hybrid modeling structure, built upon a non-parametric
Bayesian inference method, i.e. Gaussian processes. This framework is proposed
in order to be employed within the MBC context to jointly model driver/vehicle
behavior as a stochastic object. Non-parametric Bayesian methods relieve the
limitations imposed by non-evolutionary model structures and enable the
proposed framework to properly capture different stochastic behaviors. The
performance of the proposed CRH-GP-SHS framework at the inter-mode level has
been evaluated over a set of realistic lane change maneuvers from NGSIM-US101
dataset. The results show a noticeable performance improvement for GP in
comparison to the baseline constant speed model, specifically in critical
situations such as highly congested networks. Moreover, an augmented model has
also been proposed which is a composition of GP and constant speed models and
capable of capturing the driver behavior under various network reliability
conditions.

fast. The auto-encoding variational Bayes method (VAEs) was proposed in 2013,
which uses variational inference to learn a latent space from the image
database and then generates images using the decoder. The generative
adversarial networks (GANs) came out as a promising framework, which uses
adversarial training to improve the generative ability of the generator.
However, the generated pictures by GANs are generally blurry. The deep
convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs) were then proposed to
leverage the quality of generated images. Since the input noise vectors are
randomly sampled from a Gaussian distribution, the generator has to map from a
whole normal distribution to the images. This makes DCGANs unable to reflect
the inherent structure of the training data. In this paper, we propose a novel
deep model, called generative adversarial networks with decoder-encoder output
noise (DE-GANs), which takes advantage of both the adversarial training and the
variational Bayesain inference to improve the performance of image generation.
DE-GANs use a pre-trained decoder-encoder architecture to map the random
Gaussian noise vectors to informative ones and pass them to the generator of
the adversarial networks. Since the decoder-encoder architecture is trained by
the same images as the generators, the output vectors could carry the intrinsic
distribution information of the original images. Moreover, the loss function of
DE-GANs is different from GANs and DCGANs. A hidden-space loss function is
added to the adversarial loss function to enhance the robustness of the model.
Extensive empirical results show that DE-GANs can accelerate the convergence of
the adversarial training process and improve the quality of the generated
images.

  its extensions","33 pages, 15 figures",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The quantification problem consists of determining the prevalence of a given
label in a target population. However, one often has access to the labels in a
sample from the training population but not in the target population. A common
assumption in this situation is that of prior probability shift, that is, once
the labels are known, the distribution of the features is the same in the
training and target populations. In this paper, we derive a new lower bound for
the risk of the quantification problem under the prior shift assumption.
Complementing this lower bound, we present a new approximately minimax class of
estimators, ratio estimators, which generalize several previous proposals in
the literature. Using a weaker version of the prior shift assumption, which can
be tested, we show that ratio estimators can be used to build confidence
intervals for the quantification problem. We also extend the ratio estimator so
that it can: (i) incorporate labels from the target population, when they are
available and (ii) estimate how the prevalence of positive labels varies
according to a function of certain covariates.

access cognitive radio network relying on simultaneous wireless information and
power transfer. A realistic non-linear energy harvesting model is applied and a
power splitting architecture is adopted at each secondary user (SU). Since it
is difficult to obtain perfect channel state information (CSI) in practice,
instead either a bounded or gaussian CSI error model is considered. Our robust
beamforming and power splitting ratio are jointly designed for two problems
with different objectives, namely that of minimizing the transmission power of
the cognitive base station and that of maximizing the total harvested energy of
the SUs, respectively. The optimization problems are challenging to solve,
mainly because of the non-linear structure of the energy harvesting and CSI
errors models. We converted them into convex forms by using semi-definite
relaxation. For the minimum transmission power problem, we obtain the rank-2
solution under the bounded CSI error model, while for the maximum energy
harvesting problem, a two-loop procedure using a one-dimensional search is
proposed. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly
outperforms its traditional orthogonal multiple access counterpart.
Furthermore, the performance using the gaussian CSI error model is generally
better than that using the bounded CSI error model.

efficient to make good-quality predictions of the states. Moreover, there are
not many representational models for the majority of autonomous systems, as it
is not easy to build a compact model that captures the entire dynamical
subtleties and uncertainties. In this work, we present a hierarchical Bayesian
linear regression model with local features to learn the dynamics of a
micro-robotic system as well as two simpler examples, consisting of a
stochastic mass-spring damper and a stochastic double inverted pendulum on a
cart. The model is hierarchical since we assume non-stationary priors for the
model parameters. These non-stationary priors make the model more flexible by
imposing priors on the priors of the model. To solve the maximum likelihood
(ML) problem for this hierarchical model, we use the variational expectation
maximization (EM) algorithm, and enhance the procedure by introducing hidden
target variables. The algorithm yields parsimonious model structures, and
consistently provides fast and accurate predictions for all our examples
involving large training and test sets. This demonstrates the effectiveness of
the method in learning stochastic dynamics, which makes it suitable for future
use in a paradigm, such as model-based reinforcement learning, to compute
optimal control policies in real time.

three approaches with complementary strengths towards coping with the PF task

studied. For bounded constant-power generation and demand, the analysis
establishes the existence and uniqueness of a PF solution within a predefined

function approach shows that under limited constant-power demand, all PF
solutions are local minima of a function. The derived conditions can be checked

calculated the nuclear yields in successive helium shell flashes for 1.0
$M_\odot$, 1.2 $M_\odot$, and 1.35 $M_\odot$ CO WDs accreting helium-rich
matter with several mass-accretion rates ranging from $1 \times
10^{-7}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ to $7.5 \times 10^{-7}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. For the
$1.35~M_\odot$ WD with the accretion rate of $1.6 \times 10^{-7}~M_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$, the surface layer developed as helium burning ash and consisted of
40% $^{24}$Mg, 33% $^{12}$C, 23% $^{28}$Si, and a few percent of $^{20}$Ne by
weight. For a higher mass accretion rate of $7.5 \times 10^{-7}~M_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$, the surface layer consisted of 58% $^{12}$C, 31% $^{24}$Mg, and
0.43% $^{28}$Si. For the $1.2~M_\odot$ WDs, silicon is produced only for lower
mass accretion rates (2% for $1.6 \times 10^{-7}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$). No
substantial silicon ($< 0.07%$) is produced on the $1.0~M_\odot$ WD
independently of the mass-accretion rate. If the silicon-rich surface layer is

approaches and is incorporated in the morphologically dominant {100} crystal
face, in a range of different solvents - water, 1-butanol, toluene,
cyclohexanone, cyclohexane, acetonitrile and trichloromethane. To this end we
combine extensive molecular dynamics and well-tempered metadynamics simulations

conformer-conformer transition rates, and extract the characteristic relaxation
time of the conformer population in solution, adsorbed at the solid/liquid

distribution is weakly dependent on the solvent, relaxation times are instead
significantly affected by it. Furthermore, differences in the relaxation
dynamics are enhanced on the crystal surface, where conformational transitions
become slower and specific patways are hindered. This leads to observe that the
dominant mechanisms of conformational transition can also change significantly
moving from the bulk solution to the crystal interface, even for a small

findings suggests that understanding conformational flexibility is key to
provide an accurate description of the solid/liquid interface during crystal

14.221373(21) $\rm{d^{-1}}$ and F1 = 18.337249(44) $\rm{d^{-1}}$. The third
independent frequency $f_m$ = 0.3193 d$^{-1}$ is found in long cadence data
with a signal-to-noise ratio of 6.2. A weak modulation of $f_m$ to F0 and F1
modes (triplet structures centred on F0 and F1) are detected both in long and
short cadence data. This is the first detection of the modulation effect in a
double-mode HADS star. The most possible cause of the modulation effect in the
light curves is amplitude modulation with the star's rotation frequency of
0.3193 d$^{-1}$. The preliminary analysis suggests that KIC 5950759 is in the
bottom of the HADS instability strip and likely situated in the main sequence.
Spectroscopic observations are necessary to verify the true nature of the
modulation terms.

Specifically, we study memory capacity and accuracy of a quantum reservoir
computer based on the fully connected transverse field Ising model by
investigating different forms of inter-spin interactions and computing
timescales. We show that variation in inter-spin interactions leads to a better
memory capacity in general, by engineering the type of interactions the
capacity can be greatly enhanced and there exists an optimal timescale at which
the capacity is maximized. To connect computational capabilities to physical
properties of the underlaying system, we also study the out-of-time-ordered

pumping as well as the impeller dimensions on the magnetic field collimation by
helical flows in between the impeller blades. For a simplified cartesian
geometry we model the flow dynamics of a multi-blades impeller inspired by the
Von-Karman-Sodium (VKS) experiment. The study shows that a remnant magnetic
field oriented in the toroidal direction is the less efficient configuration to
collimate the magnetic field, although if the radial or vertical components are
not negligible the collimation is significantly improved. If the intensity of
the remnant magnetic field increases the system magnetic energy is larger but
the magnetic field collimation efficiency is the same, so the gain of magnetic
energy is smaller as the remnant magnetic field intensity increases. The
magnetic field collimation is modified if the impinging velocity field changes:
the collimation is weaker if the impinging velocity increases from Gamma=0.8 to
0.9, slightly larger if the impinging velocity decreases from Gamma=0.8 to 0.7.
The analysis of the impeller dimensions points out that the most efficient
configuration to collimate the magnetic field requires a ratio between impeller
blade height and base longitude between 0.375 - 0.5. The largest enhancement of
the hypothetical alpha^2 dynamo loop, compared to the hypothetical Omega-alpha
dynamo loop, is observed for the model that mimics TM 73 impeller configuration
rotating in the unscooping direction with a remnant magnetic field of 10^-3 T
orientated in the radial or vertical direction. The optimization trends
obtained in the parametric analysis are also confirmed in simulations with

  Correspondence and requests should be addressed to Zhao Pan (email:

pressure calculation is extended. Based on this framework, the optimal spatial
resolution and the corresponding minimum field-wide error level in the
calculated pressure field are determined. This minimum error can be viewed as
the smallest resolvable pressure. We find that the optimal spatial resolution
is a function of the flow features (patterns and length scales), fundamental
properties of the flow domain (e.g., geometry of the flow domain and the type
of the boundary conditions), in addition to the error in the PIV experiments,
and the choice of numerical methods. Making a general statement about pressure
sensitivity is difficult. The minimum resolvable pressure depends on competing
effects from the experimental error due to PIV and the truncation error from
the numerical solver, which is affected by the formulation of the solver. This
means that PIV experiments motivated by pressure measurements should be
carefully designed so that the optimal resolution (or close to the optimal
resolution) is used. Flows ($Re = 1.27 \times 10^4$ and $5\times 10^4$) with
exact solutions are used as examples to validate the theoretical predictions of
the optimal spatial resolutions and pressure sensitivity. The numerical
experimental results agree well with the rigorous analytical predictions. We
also propose an \textit{a posterior} method to estimate the contribution of
truncation error using Richardson extrapolation and that of PIV error by adding
artificially overwhelming noise. We also provide an introductory analysis of
the effects of interrogation window overlap in PIV in the context of the

network for robust single image depth prediction, in the context of the Robust
Vision Challenge 2018 (ROB 2018). Unlike conventional depth prediction, our
goal is to design a model that can perform well in both indoor and outdoor
scenes with a single parameter set. However, robust depth prediction suffers
from two challenging problems: a) How to extract more discriminative features
for different scenes (compared to a single scene)? b) How to handle the large
differences of depth ranges between indoor and outdoor datasets? To address
these two problems, we first formulate depth prediction as a multi-class
classification task and apply a softmax classifier to classify the depth label
of each pixel. We then introduce a global pooling layer and a channel-wise
attention mechanism to adaptively select the discriminative channels of
features and to update the original features by assigning important channels
with higher weights. Further, to reduce the influence of quantization errors,
we employ a soft-weighted sum inference strategy for the final prediction.
Experimental results on both indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. It is worth mentioning that we won the 2-nd place
in single image depth prediction entry of ROB 2018, in conjunction with IEEE

agreement with the existing experimental data. Additionally, because of the
presence of the gapless subbands, there are processes where bound excitons are
scattered into unbound electron-hole pairs belonging to the gapless subbands.
Such processes lead to a finite exciton lifetime and the broadening of its

discrete-time switched linear system whose switching sequences are constrained

to be difficult to compute or approximate. Using the semi-tensor product of
matrices, the matrix-form expression of a constrained switching system is shown
to be equivalent to that of a lifted arbitrary switching system. Then the
constrained joint/generalized spectral radius of a constrained switching system

By exploiting knowledge of the spectral norm, our algorithm solves the

suffice to approximate any $d$-sparse unitary in the black-box setting, which
matches the quantum search lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{d})$ queries and
improves upon prior art [Berry and Childs, QIP 2010] of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{2/3})$ queries. Combined with known techniques, we also
solve systems of sparse linear equations with condition number $\kappa$ using
$\mathcal{O}((\kappa \sqrt{d})^{1+o(1)}/\epsilon^{o(1)})$ queries, which is a

functions, we present a ReLU DNN representation of CPWL in FEM. We
theoretically establish that at least $2$ hidden layers are needed in a ReLU
DNN to represent any linear finite element functions in $\Omega \subseteq
\mathbb{R}^d$ when $d\ge2$. Consequently, for $d=2,3$ which are often
encountered in scientific and engineering computing, the minimal number of two
hidden layers are necessary and sufficient for any CPWL function to be
represented by a ReLU DNN. Then we include a detailed account on how a general
CPWL in $\mathbb R^d$ can be represented by a ReLU DNN with at most
$\lceil\log_2(d+1)\rceil$ hidden layers and we also give an estimation of the
number of neurons in DNN that are needed in such a representation. Furthermore,
using the relationship between DNN and FEM, we theoretically argue that a
special class of DNN models with low bit-width are still expected to have an
adequate representation power in applications. Finally, as a proof of concept,
we present some numerical results for using ReLU DNNs to solve a two point

affect the climate via the latter. It was also found that both the solar wind

reflect societal impact. This study is based on altmetrics, citation counts,
research output and case study data from the UK Research Excellence Framework

investigated the convergent validity of altmetrics by using two REF datasets:
publications submitted as research output (PRO) to the REF and publications
referenced in case studies (PCS). Case studies, which are intended to
demonstrate societal impact, should cite the most relevant research papers. We
used the MHq' indicator for assessing impact - an indicator which has been
introduced for count data with many zeros. The results of the first part of the
analysis show that news media as well as mentions on Facebook, in blogs, in
Wikipedia, and in policy-related documents have higher MHq' values for PCS than
for PRO. Thus, the altmetric indicators seem to have convergent validity for
these data. In the second part of the analysis, altmetrics have been correlated
with REF reviewers' average scores on PCS. The negative or close to zero
correlations question the convergent validity of altmetrics in that context. We
suggest that they may capture a different aspect of societal impact (which can
be called unknown attention) to that seen by reviewers (who are interested in
the causal link between research and action in society).

cell-to-cell variability, most of the currently studied models assume that the
population is homogeneous. To overcome this limitation, we use the maximum
entropy principle to model the phenotypic distribution of cells in a chemostat

metabolism and extracellular variables describing the state of the bioreactor
and take into account the impact of toxic byproduct accumulation on cell
viability. We present a formal solution for the stationary state of the

Along the way we discuss several consequences of heterogeneity, such as:
qualitative changes in the dynamical landscape of the system, increasing
concentrations of byproducts that vanish in the homogeneous case, and larger
population sizes.

gas, which is the high-temperature limit of a fluid. Most of the works have
interpreted this anomalous behavior as reflecting the growth, upon cooling, of
amorphously ordered domains, as predicted by the general framework of Bouchaud
and Biroli (BB). We explain why most-if not all-of the challenging
interpretations can be recast in a way which is consistent with that of
Bouchaud and Biroli. Finally, the comparison of the anomalous features of
$\chi$ (5) 5 and of $\chi$ (3) 3 shows that the amorphously ordered domains are
compact, i.e., the fractal dimension d f is close to the dimension d of space.
This suggests that the glass transition of molecular liquids corresponds to a
new universality class of critical phenomena.

in urban transport. The safety and health of people in a city are always
important, and transport in the metro should also be safe. When subway trains
operate, it is possible to occur various accidents such as an exit from the
rails or collision with a possible obstacle on the rails (human or another
train). In this paper, a model is proposed based on RFID technology in which
the train is equipped with a RFID reader, and a control circuit with a
microcontroller as well as placing RFID active tags at specific points of the
path. When the train approaches the tagged points of the route, the train tag
reader scans the tag number, and then the microcontroller identifies the status
of the environment by retrieving the information from the internal database.
Then, the control circuit adjusts the rotational speed of the electric motor
and the train speed consequently based on that data. In this way, the speed of
the train is adapted automatically and promptly to the conditions and the
probability of an accident in unforeseen circumstances is reduced.

cryptography and Monte Carlo simulations. Quantum random number generators
(QRNGs) represent the ultimate source of randomness, as the numbers are
obtained by sampling a physical quantum process that is intrinsically
probabilistic. However, they are yet to be widely employed to replace
deterministic pseudo random number generators (PRNG) for practical
applications. QRNGs are regarded as interesting devices. However they are
slower than PRNGs for simulations and are typically seen as clumsy laboratory
prototypes, prone to failures and unreliable for cryptographic applications.
Here we overcome these limitations and demonstrate a compact and self-contained
QRNG capable of generating random numbers at a pace of 8 Gbit/s uninterruptedly
for 71 days. During this period, the physical parameters of the quantum process
were monitored in real time by self-checking functions implemented in the
generator itself. At the same time, the output random numbers were analyzed
with the most stringent suites of statistical tests. The analysis shows that
the QRNG under test sustained the continuous operation without physical
instabilities or hardware failures. At the same time, the output random numbers
were analyzed with the most stringent suites of statistical tests, which were
passed during the whole operation time. This extensive trial demonstrates the
reliability of a robustly designed QRNG and paves the way to its use in
practical applications based on randomness.

measurement outcomes, and other elements of quantum dynamics. However, with
quantum mechanics assigning probabilities to such objects, it is often
desirable to work with the notion of a ""total"" that takes into account their
varied relevance. For example, such an effective count of position states
available to a lattice electron could characterize its localization properties.
Similarly, the effective total of outcomes in the measurement step of a quantum
computation relates to the efficiency of the quantum algorithm. Despite a broad
need for effective counting, a well-founded prescription has not been
formulated. Instead, the assignments that do not respect the measure-like
nature of the concept, such as versions of the participation number or
exponentiated entropies, are used in some areas. Here, we develop the additive
theory of effective number functions (ENFs), namely functions assigning
consistent totals to collections of objects endowed with probability weights.
Our analysis reveals the existence of a minimal total, realized by the unique
ENF, which leads to effective counting with absolute meaning. Touching upon the
nature of the measure, our results may find applications not only in quantum
physics, but also in other quantitative sciences.

boundary precipitation at near-atomic scale in aluminum alloys is crucial to
tailor mechanical properties and to increase resistance to corrosion and stress
corrosion cracking. Here, we elucidate the sequence of precipitation on grain
boundaries in comparison to the bulk in a model Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy. We
investigate the material from the solution heat treated state
(475{\textdegree}C), through the very early stages of aging to the peak aged
state at 120{\textdegree}C and further into the overaged regime at
180{\textdegree}C. The process starts with solute enrichment on grain
boundaries due to equilibrium segregation accompanied by solute depletion in
their vicinity, the formation of Guinier--Preston (GP) zones in the
solute-enriched grain boundary regions, and GP zones growth and transformation.
The equilibrium segregation of solutes to grain boundaries during aging
accelerates this sequence compared to the bulk. Analysis of the ~10 nm wide
precipitate-free zones (PFZs) adjacent to the solute-enriched grain boundaries
2 shows that the depletion zones are determined by (i) interface equilibrium
segregation; (ii) formation and coarsening of the grain boundary precipitates
and (iii) the diffusion range of solutes in the matrix. In addition, we
quantify the difference in kinetics between grain boundary and bulk
precipitation. The precipitation kinetics, as observed in terms of volume
fraction, average radius, and number density, is almost identical next to the
depletion zone in the bulk and far inside the bulk grain remote from any grain
boundary influence. This observation shows that the region influenced by the
grain boundaries does not extend beyond the PFZs.

drawback of FISTA, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective
modification to the algorithm which has two advantages: 1) it enables us to
prove the convergence of the generated sequence; 2) it shows superior practical
performance compared to the original FISTA. Numerical experiments are presented
to illustrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm.

depends on two free parameters: The smoothing parameter and the order of the
curvature correction. It turns out that this method is nothing but a compromise
between two fundamental conditions which are the so-called asymptotic limit
which comes from the so-called remainder which imposes a small as possible
smoothing parameter and the smoothing condition which forces that parameter to
be, at least, slightly larger than the inter shell spacing. In this paper, to
find the best value of the smoothing parameter, a new criterion is proposed
instead of the plateau condition . This new criterion is much more clear and
free from ambiguities of the usual plateau condition. It is also found, that
the second free parameter, i.e., the order of the curvature correction, plays
an accessory role since, it is connected intimately to the smoothing parameter,
when the smoothing is realized. This paper provides a new and definitive
insight into Strutinsky's method and its relationship with semi-classical

dwarfs rather than electron capture supernovae (ECSN). The reason is ascribed
to the ability of the second dredge-up to significantly reduce the mass of the
He core and of the efficient AGB winds[...]. In this study, we investigate the
formation of ECSN through case A and case B mass transfer. In these scenarios,
when Roche lobe overflow stops, the primary has become a helium star. With a
small envelope left, the second dredge-up is prevented, potentially opening new
paths to ECSN. We compute binary models using our stellar evolution code
BINSTAR. We consider three different secondary masses of 8, 9, and 10 $M_\odot$
and explore the parameter space, varying the companion mass, orbital period,
and input physics. Assuming conservative mass transfer, with our choice of
secondary masses all case A systems enter contact either during the main
sequence or as a consequence of reversed mass transfer when the secondary
overtakes its companion during core helium burning. Case B systems are able to
produce ECSN progenitors in a relatively small range of periods ($3\le P(d)\le
30$) and primary masses ($10.9\le M/M_\odot\le 11.5$). Changing the companion
mass has little impact on the primary's fate as long as the mass ratio
$M_1/M_2$ remains less than 1.4-1.5, above which evolution to contact becomes
unavoidable. We also find that allowing for systemic mass loss substantially
increases the period interval over which ECSN can occur. This change in the
binary physics does not however affect the primary mass range. We finally
stress that the formation of ECSN progenitors through case A and B mass
transfer is very sensitive to adopted binary and stellar physics. Close
binaries provide additional channels for ECSN but the parameter space is rather
constrained likely making ECSN a rare event.

determines the level of forgetting. Catastrophic forgetting is interrelated to
mode collapse and can make the training of GANs non-convergent. We investigate
the landscape of the discriminator's output in different variants of GANs and
find that when a GAN converges to a good equilibrium, real training datapoints
are wide local maxima of the discriminator. We empirically show the
relationship between the sharpness of local maxima and mode collapse and
generalization in GANs. We show how catastrophic forgetting prevents the
discriminator from making real datapoints local maxima, and thus causes
non-convergence. Finally, we study methods for preventing catastrophic

(\textsc{NMF}) algorithms, initialization is a key aspect as it significantly
influences both the convergence and the final solution obtained. Many
initialization schemes have been proposed for NMF, among which one of the most
popular class of methods are based on the singular value decomposition (SVD).
However, these SVD-based initializations do not satisfy a rather natural
condition, namely that the error should decrease as the rank of factorization
increases. In this paper, we propose a novel SVD-based \textsc{NMF}
initialization to specifically address this shortcoming by taking into account
the SVD factors that were discarded to obtain a nonnegative initialization.
This method, referred to as nonnegative SVD with low-rank correction
(NNSVD-LRC), allows us to significantly reduce the initial error at a
negligible additional computational cost using the low-rank structure of the
discarded SVD factors. NNSVD-LRC has two other advantages compared to previous
SVD-based initializations: (1) it provably generates sparse initial factors,
and (2) it is faster as it only requires to compute a truncated SVD of rank
$\lceil r/2 + 1 \rceil$ where $r$ is the factorization rank of the sought NMF
decomposition (as opposed to a rank-$r$ truncated SVD for other methods). We
show on several standard dense and sparse data sets that our new method
competes favorably with state-of-the-art SVD-based initializations for NMF.

problems appearing in signal and image processing, such as denoising or
deblurring. A first route relies on Bayesian modeling, where prior
probabilities are used to embody models of both the distribution of the unknown
variables and their statistical dependence with the observed data. The
estimation process typically relies on the minimization of an expected loss
(e.g. minimum mean squared error, or MMSE). The second route has received much
attention in the context of sparse regularization and compressive sensing: it
consists in designing (often convex) optimization problems involving the sum of
a data fidelity term and a penalty term promoting certain types of unknowns
(e.g., sparsity, promoted through an 1 norm). Well known relations between
these two approaches have lead to some widely spread misconceptions. In
particular, while the so-called Maximum A Posterori (MAP) estimate with a
Gaussian noise model does lead to an optimization problem with a quadratic
data-fidelity term, we disprove through explicit examples the common belief
that the converse would be true. It has already been shown [7, 9] that for
denoising in the presence of additive Gaussian noise, for any prior probability
on the unknowns, MMSE estimation can be expressed as a penalized least squares
problem, with the apparent characteristics of a MAP estimation problem with
Gaussian noise and a (generally) different prior on the unknowns. In other
words, the variational approach is rich enough to build all possible MMSE
estimators associated to additive Gaussian noise via a well chosen penalty. We
generalize these results beyond Gaussian denoising and characterize noise
models for which the same phenomenon occurs. In particular, we prove that with
(a variant of) Poisson noise and any prior probability on the unknowns, MMSE
estimation can again be expressed as the solution of a penalized least squares
optimization problem. For additive scalar denois-ing the phenomenon holds if
and only if the noise distribution is log-concave. In particular, Laplacian
denoising can (perhaps surprisingly) be expressed as the solution of a
penalized least squares problem. In the multivariate case, the same phenomenon
occurs when the noise model belongs to a particular subset of the exponential

density of a Young measure is introduced and illustrated with examples. It is
proved that the density of a Young measure is weakly sequentially closed set.
In the case when density of a Young measure is a singleton (up to the set of
null measure), it is shown that the strong closedness (in rca(K)) of the set of
such measures, associated with Borel functions with values in the compact set K
? Rl, is equivalent with the strong closedness (in L1(K)) of the set of their
densities, provided the set K is convex. For an m-oscillating function the
notion of a total slope is proposed. It turns out, that if the total slopes of
the elements of the sequence of oscillating functions form monotonic sequence,
then the sequence of the respective (homogeneous) Young measures is weakly
convergent in rca(K). The limit is a homogeneous Young measure with the density
being the weak L1 sequential limit of the densities of the underlying Young
measures.

attention owing to the intriguing physics behind and the fundamental role it
played in stabilizing magnetic solitons, such as magnetic skyrmions and chiral
domain walls. A number of experimental efforts have been devoted to probe the
DMI, among which the most popular method is the Brillouin light scattering
spectroscopy (BLS) to measure the frequency difference of spin waves with
opposite wave vectors $\pm\mathbf{k}$ perpendicular to the in-plane
magnetization $\mathbf{m}$. Such a technique, however, is not applicable for
the cases of $\mathbf{k}\parallel\mathbf{m}$, since the spin-wave reciprocity
is recovered then. For a narrow magnetic strip, it is also difficult to measure
the DMI strength using BLS because of the spatial resolution limit of lights.
To fill these gaps, we propose to probe the DMI via the propagation of spin
waves in ferromagnetic films. We show that the DMI can cause the
non-collinearity of the group velocities of spin waves with
$\pm\mathbf{k}\parallel\mathbf{m}$. In heterogeneous magnetic thin films with
different DMIs, negative refractions of spin waves emerge at the interface
under proper conditions. These findings enable us to quantify the DMI strength
by measuring the angle between the two spin-wave beams with
$\pm\mathbf{k}\parallel\mathbf{m}$ in homogeneous film and by measuring the
incident and negative refraction angles in heterogeneous films. For a narrow
magnetic strip, we propose a nonlocal scheme to determine the DMI strength via
nonlinear three-magnon processes. We implement theoretical calculations and
micromagnetic simulations to verify our ideas. The results presented here are
helpful for future measurement of the DMI and for designing novel spin-wave
spintronic devices.

centroid energy and line width is relatively lower ($<$ 6.4 keV) and narrower
($\sim$80 eV) around the center of the remnant, which implies that the majority
of the Fe ejecta in the central region is red-shifted. At the outer regions, we
identify bright blue-shifted structures as it might have been ejected as high
velocity dense clumps. Taking into account the broad population of the Fe
charge states, we estimate the red-shifted velocity of ~2,000 km/s and the
blue-shifted velocity of ~3,000 km/s for each velocity structure. We also
present a possibility that a portion of the Fe ejecta near the center are
interacting with the dense circumstellar medium (CSM) on the near side of the
remnant. As the origin of the asymmetric motion of the Fe ejecta, we suggest
three scenarios, (1) the asymmetric distribution of the CSM, (2) the ""shadow""

of axial breathing modes obtained with the mean--field--based random--phase

Fermi liquid theory, between the excitation frequency of axial modes to
$\sqrt{m/m^*}$, where $m$ ($m^*$) is the bare (effective) mass. Such an

renormalization of single--particle excitation energies generated by the

finding a set of nested codes having parameters with these values and with the

improved constructions and provide closed formula estimates on their

millisecond duration has been discovered. The origin of these so-called Fast
Radio Bursts (FRBs) is still a great mystery despite the growing observational
efforts made by various multi-wavelength and multi-messenger facilities. So
far, many models have been proposed to explain FRBs but neither the progenitors
nor the radiative and the particle acceleration processes at work have been
clearly identified. In this paper, the question whether some hadronic processes
may occur in the vicinity of the FRB source is assessed. If so, FRBs may
contribute to the high energy cosmic-ray and neutrino fluxes. A search for
these hadronic signatures has been done using the ANTARES neutrino telescope.
The analysis consists in looking for high-energy neutrinos, in the TeV-PeV
regime, spatially and temporally coincident with the detected FRBs. Most of the
FRBs discovered in the period 2013-2017 were in the field of view of the
ANTARES detector, which is sensitive mostly to events originating from the
Southern hemisphere. From this period, 12 FRBs have been selected and no
coincident neutrino candidate was observed. Upper limits on the per burst
neutrino fluence have been derived using a power law spectrum,
$\rm{\frac{dN}{dE_\nu}\propto E_\nu^{-\gamma}}$, for the incoming neutrino
flux, assuming spectral indexes $\gamma$ = 1.0, 2.0, 2.5. Finally, the neutrino
energy has been constrained by computing the total energy radiated in neutrinos
assuming different distances for the FRBs. Constraints on the neutrino fluence
and on the energy released are derived from the associated null results.

such flaring events represents a goldmine for theoretical studies. Such a
flaring event was captured by the INTEGRAL mission in June 2015 while
performing its (as of today) deepest extragalactic survey when it caught the
prominent blazar 3C~279 in its brightest flare ever recorded at gamma-ray
energies. The flare was simultaneously recorded by the Fermi gamma-ray mission,
by the Swift mission, by the INTEGRAL mission and by observations ranging from
UV, through optical to the near-IR bands. The derived snapshot of this broad
spectral energy distribution of the flare has been modeled in the context of a
one-zone radiation transfer leptonic and lepto-hadronic models constraining the
single emission components. The derived parameters of both models challenge the
physical conditions in the jet. However, very recently published

estimates of the emitting region size, $R$ (either from gravitational
microlensing, reverberation mapping or from the scaling of size with intrinsic
quasar luminosity), we obtain masses for 10 objects which are in agreement
within uncertainties with previous mass estimates based on the virial theorem.
Reverberation mapping estimates of the size of the Fe

broadening this knowledge: (a) with an eye tracker, the salient features used

inside a larger HI loop that has been created by the outflows of the Upper
Scorpius OB association. An HI cavity filled with hot X-ray gas is associated
with the structure, which is consistent with the Galactic chimney scenario. The
X-ray emission extends beyond the west and north-west edges of the bubble,
suggesting that hot gas outflows are breaching the cavity, possibly through the
fragmented Lupus complex. Analyses of the polarised radio synchrotron and of
the polarised dust emission of the region suggest the connection of the
Galactic centre spur with the young Galactic bubble. A distribution of HI
clumps that spatially corresponds well to the cavity boundaries was found at

from the fragmented part of the bubble. We suggest that these clumps might be
`dripping' cold clouds from the shell walls inside the cavity that is filled
with hot ionised gas. It is possible that some of these clumps are magnetised
and were then accelerated by the compressed magnetic field at the edge of the
cavity. Such a mechanism would challenge the Galactic accretion and fountain
model, where high-velocity clouds are considered to be formed at high Galactic
latitude from hot gas flows from the Galactic plane.

perfect undetectability. This index can help a control system operator to
localize the most vulnerable actuators in the networked control system, which
can then be secured. Particularly, the security index of an actuator equals the
minimum number of sensors and actuators that needs to be compromised, such that
a perfectly undetectable attack against that actuator can be conducted. A
method for computing the index for small scale networked control systems is
derived, and it is shown that the index can potentially be increased by placing
additional sensors. The difficulties that appear once the system is of a large
scale are then outlined: the problem of calculating the index is NP--hard, the
index is vulnerable to system variations, and it is based on the assumption
that the attacker knows the entire model of the system. To overcome these
difficulties, a robust security index is introduced. The robust index can be
calculated in polynomial time, it is unaffected by the system variations, and
it can be related to both limited and full model knowledge attackers.
Additionally, we analyze two sensor placement problems with the objective to
increase the robust indices. We show that both of these problems have
submodular structures, so their suboptimal solutions with performance
guarantees can be obtained in polynomial time. Finally, the theoretical
developments are illustrated through numerical examples.

wireless communications to characterize the propagation of fading channels. It
is currently adopted for many different kinds of wireless network problems such
as power consumption issues, modelling the communication environment, and
received signal strength (RSS)-based localization. PLE estimation is thus of
great use to assist in wireless networking. However, a majority of methods to
estimate the PLE require either some particular information of the wireless
network, which might be unknown or some external auxiliary devices, such as
anchor nodes or the Global Positioning System. Moreover, this external
information might sometimes be unreliable, spoofed, or difficult to obtain.
Therefore, a self-estimator for the PLE, which is able to work independently,
becomes an urgent demand to robustly and securely get a grip on the PLE for
various wireless network applications. This paper is the first to introduce two
methods that can solely and locally estimate the PLE. To start, a new linear
regression model for the PLE is presented. Based on this model, a closed-form
total least squares (TLS) method to estimate the PLE is first proposed, in
which, with no other assistance or external information, each node can estimate
the PLE merely by collecting RSSs. Second, to suppress the estimation errors, a
closed-form weighted TLS method is further developed, having a better
performance. Due to their simplicity and independence of any auxiliary system,
our two proposed methods can be easily incorporated into any kind of wireless
communication stack. Simulation results show that our estimators are reliable,
even in harsh environments, where the PLE is high. Many potential applications
are also explicitly illustrated in this paper, such as secure RSS-based
localization, kth nearest neighbour routing, etc.

field. The general properties of the asymptotic trajectories are discussed. In
most of standing EM waves (including identical tightly-focused
counter-propagating beams) the asymptotic trajectories are periodic with the
period of the wave field. Furthermore, for a certain model of the laser beam we
show that the asymptotic trajectories are periodic in the reference frame

that affect the strengths and shapes of spectral absorption lines and create
slightly asymmetric line profiles. 1D LTE studies of elemental abundances are
not able to reproduce this phenomenon, which becomes particularly important
when modeling the impact of isotopic fine structure, like the subtle depression
created by the 6Li isotope on the red wing of the Li I resonance doublet line.
The purpose of this work is to provide corrections for the lithium abundance,
A(Li), and the 6Li/7Li ratio that can easily be applied to correct 1D LTE
lithium abundances in G and F dwarf stars of approximately solar mass and
metallicity for 3D and non-LTE (NLTE) effects. The corrections for A(Li) and
6Li/7Li are computed using grids of 3D NLTE and 1D LTE synthetic lithium line
profiles, generated from 3D hydro-dynamical CO5BOLD and 1D hydrostatic model
atmospheres, respectively. The 3D NLTE corrections are then approximated by
analytical expressions as a function of the stellar parameters. These are
applied to adjust the 1D LTE isotopic lithium abundances in two solar-type
stars, HD 207129 and HD 95456. The derived 3D NLTE corrections range between
-0.01 and +0.11 dex for A(Li), and between -4.9 and -0.4% for the 6Li/7Li
ratio, depending on the adopted stellar parameters. In the case of the 6Li/7Li
ratio, our corrections are always negative, showing that 1D LTE analysis can
significantly overestimate (up to 4.9 percentage points) the presence of 6Li in
the atmospheres of solar-like dwarf stars. These results emphasize the
importance of reliable 3D model atmospheres combined with NLTE line formation
for deriving precise isotopic lithium abundances. Although 3D NLTE spectral
synthesis implies an extensive computational effort, the results can be made
accessible with parametric tools like the ones presented in this work.

the binaural cues, aiming at preserving the spatial perception of the acoustic
scene. A well-known binaural noise reduction algorithm is the binaural minimum
variance distortionless response beamformer, which can be steered using the
relative transfer function (RTF) vector of the desired source, relating the
acoustic transfer functions between the desired source and all microphones to a
reference microphone. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient
method to estimate the RTF vector in a diffuse noise field, requiring an
additional microphone that is spatially separated from the head-mounted
microphones. Assuming that the spatial coherence between the noise components
in the head-mounted microphone signals and the additional microphone signal is
zero, we show that an unbiased estimate of the RTF vector can be obtained.
Based on real-world recordings, experimental results for several reverberation
times show that the proposed RTF estimator outperforms the widely used RTF
estimator based on covariance whitening and a simple biased RTF estimator in
terms of noise reduction and binaural cue preservation performance.

that both techniques are severely limited when applied to this problem.
Survival models can only incorporate aggregate representations of users instead

factors that could affect people's performance in their daily work activities.
The software engineering research community has marginally investigated the
effects of noise on software engineers' performance. Aims: We studied if noise
affects software engineers' performance in (i) comprehending functional
requirements and (ii) fixing faults in the source code. Method: We conducted
two experiments with final-year undergraduate students in Computer Science. In
the first experiment, we asked 55 students to comprehend functional
requirements exposing them or not to noise, while in the second experiment 42
students were asked to fix faults in Java code. Results: The participants in
the second experiment, when exposed to noise, had significantly worse
performance in fixing faults in the source code. On the other hand, we did not
observe any statistically significant difference in the first experiment.
Conclusions: Fixing faults in source code seems to be more vulnerable to noise
than comprehending functional requirements.

Hall shift of a Gaussian light beam. Using this relationship, we show that
arbitrarily large weak value amplification far beyond the conventional weak
measurement limit can be experimentally obtained from the position of the

on the other hand, is related to the spatial gradient of geometric phase of
light, which in this particular scenario evolves due to the weak interaction

relationships between the weak values and the complex zeros of the response

detailed balance holds at any instant of time but the system is driven through
time-periodic variations of external parameters, it evolves toward a
time-periodic state, which can also support non-vanishing currents. In both
cases the maintenance of currents throughout the system incurs a cost in terms
of entropy production. Here we compare these two scenarios for one dimensional
diffusive systems with periodic boundary condition, a framework commonly used
to model biological and artificial molecular machines. We first show that the
entropy production rate in a periodically driven system is necessarily greater
than that in a stationary system without detailed balance, when both are
described by the same (time-averaged) current and probability distribution.
Next, we show how to construct both a non-equilibrium steady state and a

periodically driven system is higher than that of an equivalent steady state,
the difference between the two entropy production rates can be tuned to be

  Given a fixed sigma-finite measure $\mu$, we consider positive definite
kernels defined on the subset of the sigma algebra having finite $\mu$ measure.
We show that then the corresponding Hilbert factorizations consist of signed

further leads to new insight into the associated Gaussian processes, their

Spatially confined regions with an enhanced light emission intensity (hotspots)
are identified within the active areas of SiPM micro-cells. By correlating the

studying the normal mode analysis of planar shocks in the evolutionary case, we
show that for a uniquely defined tangential velocity with respect to the planar

oscillating wave packets, when reflected on the shock front, vanishes. This
specific tangential velocity is found to coincide with the expression given by
Majda and Rosales [Stud. Appl. Math. 1984] when they determine the steady

periodic in $t$ and satisfies $f(\cdot,0)=0$. In the autonomous case where
$f=f(u)$, the convergence of every bounded solution to an equilibrium has been
established by Du and Matano (2010). However, the presence of periodic forcing
makes the problem significantly more difficult, partly because the structure of
time periodic solutions is much less understood than that of steady states. In
this paper, we first prove that any $\omega$-limit solution is either spatially
constant or symmetrically decreasing, even if the initial data is not
symmetric. Furthermore, we show that the set of $\omega$-limit solutions either
consists of a single time-periodic solution or it consists of multiple
time-periodic solutions and heteroclinic connections among them. Next, under a
mild non-degenerate assumption on the corresponding ODE, we prove that the
$\omega$-limit set is a singleton, which implies the solution converges to a
time-periodic solution. Lastly, we apply these results to equations with
bistable nonlinearity and combustion nonlinearity, and specify more precisely
which time-periodic solutions can possibly be selected as the limit.

employed in large-scale storage systems. In the compaction of the key-value
store, SSTables are merged with overlapping key ranges and sorted for data
queries. This, however, incurs write amplification and thus degrades system
performance, especially under update-intensive workloads. Current optimization
focuses mostly on the reduction of the overload of compaction in the host, but
rarely makes full use of computation in the device. To address these issues, we
propose Co-KV, a Collaborative Key-Value store between the host and a near-data
processing ( i.e., NDP) model based SSD to improve compaction. Co-KV offers
three benefits: (1) reducing write amplification by a compaction offloading
scheme between host and device; (2) relieving the overload of compaction in the
host and leveraging computation in the SSD based on the NDP model; and (3)
improving the performance of LSM-tree based key-value stores under
update-intensive workloads.
  Extensive db_bench experiment show that Co-KV largely achieves a 2.0x overall
throughput improvement, and a write amplification reduction by up to 36.0% over
the state-of-the-art LevelDB. Under YCSB workloads, Co-KV increases the
throughput by 1.7x - 2.4x while decreases the write amplification and average
latency by up to 30.0% and 43.0%, respectively.

deceased subjects, by training a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)
designed for the purpose of semantic segmentation. Post-mortem iris recognition
has recently emerged as an alternative, or additional, method useful in
forensic analysis. At the same time it poses many new challenges from the
technological standpoint, one of them being the image segmentation stage, which
has proven difficult to be reliably executed by conventional iris recognition
methods. Our approach is based on the SegNet architecture, fine-tuned with
1,300 manually segmented post-mortem iris images taken from the
Warsaw-BioBase-Post-Mortem-Iris v1.0 database. The experiments presented in
this paper show that this data-driven solution is able to learn specific
deformations present in post-mortem samples, which are missing from alive
irises, and offers a considerable improvement over the state-of-the-art,
conventional segmentation algorithm (OSIRIS): the Intersection over Union (IoU)
metric was improved from 73.6% (for OSIRIS) to 83% (for DCNN-based presented in
this paper) averaged over subject-disjoint, multiple splits of the data into
train and test subsets. This paper offers the first known to us method of
automatic processing of post-mortem iris images. We offer source codes with the
trained DCNN that perform end-to-end segmentation of post-mortem iris images,
as described in this paper. Also, we offer binary masks corresponding to manual
segmentation of samples from Warsaw-BioBase-Post-Mortem-Iris v1.0 database to
facilitate development of alternative methods for post-mortem iris
segmentation.

the subuniverse of $L$-separated types is again a reflective subuniverse, which
we call $L'$. Furthermore, we prove results establishing that $L'$ is almost
left exact. We next focus on localization with respect to a map, giving results
on preservation of coproducts and connectivity. We also study how such
localizations interact with other reflective subuniverses and orthogonal
factorization systems. As key steps towards proving the main theorem, we show
that localization at a prime commutes with taking loop spaces for a pointed,
simply connected type, and explicitly describe the localization of an
Eilenberg-Mac Lane space $K(G,n)$ with $G$ abelian. We also include a partial

Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille (LAM) in ERIOS chamber under vacuum
and thermal conditions in order to qualify the instrument in its operating
environment and to perform the final acceptance test before delivery to the
payload. One of the main objectives of the test campaign will be the
measurement of the focus position of NISP image plane with respect to the
EUCLID object plane. To simulate the EUCLID object plane, a telescope simulator
with a very well know focal distance will be installed in front of NISP into
ERIOS chamber. We need to measure at cold and vacuum the position of reflectors
installed on NISP instrument and the telescope simulator. From these
measurements, we will provide at operational temperature the measurement of
references frames set on the telescope simulator and NISP, the knowledge of the
coordinates of the object point source provided by the telescope simulator and
the measurement of the angle between the telescope simulator optical axis and
NISP optical axis. In this context, we have developed a metrology method based
on the use of a laser tracker to measure the position of the reflectors inside
ERIOS. The laser tracker is installed outside the vacuum chamber and measure
through a curved window reflectors put inside the chamber either at ambient
pressure or vacuum pressure. Several tests campaigns have been done at LAM to
demonstrate the measurement performance with this configuration. Using a well
know reflectors configuration, we show that it is possible to correct the laser
tracker measurement from the window disturbances and from the vacuum impact. A
corrective term is applied to the data and allows retrieving the real
coordinates of the reflectors with a bias lower than 30$\mu$m, which is lower
than the laser tracker measurement uncertainties estimated at 60$\mu$m. No
additional error term of the laser tracker measurement is observed when using
the laser tracker with the curved window and in vacuum, comparing with a
classical use of the laser tracker. With these test campaign, we have been able
to demonstrate the possibility to use a laser tracker to measure in real time
during a vacuum thermal test the position of different mechanical parts into a
vacuum chamber with an accuracy better than 60$\mu$m.

and allocating the rooms of an apartment among roommates (agents) in a fair
manner. In this setup, a distribution of the rent and an allocation is said to
be fair if it is envy free, i.e., under the imposed rents, no agent has a
strictly stronger preference for any other agent's room. The cardinal
preferences of the agents are expressed via functions which specify the
utilities of the agents for the rooms at every possible room rent/price. While
envy-free solutions are guaranteed to exist under reasonably general utility
functions, efficient algorithms for finding them were known only for
quasilinear utilities. This work addresses this notable gap and develops
approximation algorithms for fair rent division with minimal assumptions on the
utility functions.
  Specifically, we show that if the agents have continuous, monotone
decreasing, and piecewise-linear utilities, then the fair rent-division problem
admits a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS). That is, we
develop algorithms that find allocations and prices of the rooms such that for
each agent a the utility of the room assigned to it is within a factor of $(1 +
\epsilon)$ of the utility of the room most preferred by a. Here, $\epsilon>0$
is an approximation parameter, and the running time of the algorithms is
polynomial in $1/\epsilon$ and the input size. In addition, we show that the
methods developed in this work provide truthful mechanisms for special cases of
the rent-division problem. Envy-free solutions correspond to equilibria of a
two-sided matching market with monetary transfers; hence, this work also
provides efficient algorithms for finding approximate equilibria in such
markets. We complement the algorithmic results by proving that the fair rent
division problem lies in the intersection of the complexity classes PPAD and
PLS.

precipitation from weather stations, are commonly used as a convenient
substitute for direct observations because these products provide a spatially
and temporally continuous and complete source of data. However, when the goal
is to characterize climatological features of extreme precipitation over a
spatial domain (e.g., a map of return values) at the native spatial scales of
these phenomena, then gridded products may lead to incorrect conclusions
because daily precipitation is a fractal field and hence any smoothing
technique will dampen local extremes. To address this issue, we create a new
""probabilistic"" gridded product specifically designed to characterize the
climatological properties of extreme precipitation by applying spatial
statistical analyses to daily measurements of precipitation from the GHCN over
CONUS. The essence of our method is to first estimate the climatology of
extreme precipitation based on station data and then use a data-driven
statistical approach to interpolate these estimates to a fine grid. We argue
that our method yields an improved characterization of the climatology within a
grid cell because the probabilistic behavior of extreme precipitation is much
better behaved (i.e., smoother) than daily weather. Furthermore, the spatial
smoothing innate to our approach significantly increases the signal-to-noise
ratio in the estimated extreme statistics relative to an analysis without
smoothing. Finally, by deriving a data-driven approach for translating extreme
statistics to a spatially complete grid, the methodology outlined in this paper
resolves the issue of how to properly compare station data with output from
earth system models. We conclude the paper by comparing our probabilistic
gridded product with a standard extreme value analysis of the Livneh gridded
daily precipitation product.

a prominent research direction in contemporary physics. Here we provide the
example of a spin chain with random and inhomogeneous couplings that in the
ground state exhibits a very unusual area law violation. In the clean limit,
i.e., without disorder, the model is the rainbow chain and has volume law
entanglement. We show that, in the presence of disorder, the entanglement
entropy exhibits a power-law growth with the subsystem size, with an exponent
1/2. By employing the Strong Disorder Renormalization Group (SDRG) framework,
we show that this exponent is related to the survival probability of certain
random walks. The ground state of the model exhibits extended regions of
short-range singlets (that we term ``bubble'' regions) as well as rare long
range singlet (``rainbow'' regions). Crucially, while the probability of
extended rainbow regions decays exponentially with their size, that of the
bubble regions is power law. We provide strong numerical evidence for the
correctness of SDRG results by exploiting the free-fermion solution of the
model. Finally, we investigate the role of interactions by considering the
random inhomogeneous XXZ spin chain. Within the SDRG framework and in the
strong inhomogeneous limit, we show that the above area-law violation takes
place only at the free-fermion point of phase diagram. This point divides two
extended regions, which exhibit volume-law and area-law entanglement,

partitioned into structured subdomains along all spatial directions, and each
subdomain contains an overlapping region for source transferring. At each
iteration all subdomain PML problems are solved completely in parallel, then
all horizontal, vertical and corner directional residuals on each subdomain are
passed to its corresponding neighbor subdomains as the source for the next
iteration. This DDM method is highly scalable in nature and theoretically shown
to produce the exact solution for the PML problem defined in ${\mathbb{R}}^2$
in the constant medium case. A slightly modified version of the method for
bounded truncated domains is also developed for its use in practice and an
error estimate is rigorously proved. Various numerical experiments in two and
three dimensions are conducted on the supercomputer ""Tianhe-2 Cluster"" to
verify the theoretical results and demonstrate excellent performance of the

shown that accelerated electrons have largely escaped from the confinement,
which is likely due to the disruption of the initially confined PWN by the SNR
reverse shock. The escaped electrons propagate to the earth and contribute to
the measured local cosmic-ray (CR) electron spectrum. We find that the escaped
CR electrons from Vela X would hugely exceed the measured flux by HESS at $\sim
10$ TeV if the standard diffusion coefficient for the interstellar medium is
used. We propose that the diffusion may be highly inefficient around Vela X and
find that a spatially-dependent diffusion can lead to CR flux consistent with
the HESS measurement. Using a two-zone model for the diffusion around Vela X,
we find that the diffusion coefficient in the inner region of a few tens of
parsecs should be $<10^{28}{\rm cm^2 s^{-1}}$ for $\sim10$ TeV CR electrons,
which is about two orders of magnitude lower than the standard value for ISM.
Such inefficient diffusion around PWN resembles the case of the Geminga and
Monogem PWNe, suggesting that inefficient diffusion may be common in the
vicinity of PWNe spanning a wide range of ages.

while performing a manipulation task. In this method, we use linear
complementarity constraints to model rigid body contacts and find a locally
optimal solution for joint displacements and magnitudes of support forces.
Then, joint torques are calculated such that the support forces have the
highest priority. We evaluate our framework in a 2.5D, quasi-static simulation
in which a humanoid robot with planar arms manipulates a heavy object. Our
results suggest that the proposed method provides the robot with the ability to
balance itself by generating support forces on the environment while
simultaneously performing the manipulation task.

is now well known, but less well understood. Via a novel experimental analysis,
we illustrate some facts about deep convolutional networks for image
classification that shed new light on their behaviour and how it connects to
the problem of adversaries. In short, the celebrated performance of these
networks and their vulnerability to adversarial attack are simply two sides of
the same coin: the input image-space directions along which the networks are
most vulnerable to attack are the same directions which they use to achieve
their classification performance in the first place. We develop this result in
two main steps. The first uncovers the fact that classes tend to be associated
with specific image-space directions. This is shown by an examination of the
class-score outputs of nets as functions of 1D movements along these
directions. This provides a novel perspective on the existence of universal
adversarial perturbations. The second is a clear demonstration of the tight
coupling between classification performance and vulnerability to adversarial
attack within the spaces spanned by these directions. Thus, our analysis
resolves the apparent contradiction between accuracy and vulnerability. It
provides a new perspective on much of the prior art and reveals profound
implications for efforts to construct neural nets that are both accurate and
robust to adversarial attack.

superconductivity and Landau level physics yields a rich phase diagram of
states as a function of $\mu/t$ and $\Delta/t$, where $\mu$, $t$ and $\Delta$
are the chemical potential, hopping strength, and the amplitude of the
superconducting gap. In addition to quantum Hall states and topologically
trivial p-wave superconductor, the phase diagram also accommodates regions of
topological superconductivity. Most importantly, we find that application of a
non-uniform, periodic magnetic field produced by a square or a hexagonal

superconductivity in the limit of $\Delta/t\rightarrow 0$. In contrast, a
uniform magnetic field, a hexagonal Abrikosov lattice of $h/2e$ fluxoids, or a
one dimensional lattice of stripes produces topological superconductivity only
for sufficiently large $\Delta/t$.

location-based social networks. Recent studies have explored the idea of
adopting collaborative ranking (CR) for recommendation, combining the idea of

sparsity problem, mainly because it associates similar users based on exact
matching of the venues in their check-in history. Even though research in
collaborative filtering has shown that considering auxiliary information such
as geographical influence, helps the model to alleviate the sparsity problem,
the same direction still needs to be explored in CR. In this work, we present a
CR framework that focuses on the top of the ranked list while integrating an
arbitrary number of similarity functions between venues as it learns the
model's parameters. We further introduce three example similarity measures
based on venues' contents and locations. Incorporating cross-venue similarity
measures into the model enhances the latent associations between users as
similar venues are also taken into account while associating users with each
other. Our experiments on the TREC Contextual Suggestion dataset show that our

perturbations. This is reminiscent of cellular decision-making where ligands
(called antagonists) prevent correct signalling, like in early immune
recognition. We draw a formal analogy between neural networks used in machine
learning and models of cellular decision-making (adaptive proofreading). We
apply attacks from machine learning to simple decision-making models, and show
explicitly the correspondence to antagonism by weakly bound ligands. Such
antagonism is absent in more nonlinear models, which inspired us to implement a
biomimetic defence in neural networks filtering out adversarial perturbations.
We then apply a gradient-descent approach from machine learning to different
cellular decision-making models, and we reveal the existence of two regimes
characterized by the presence or absence of a critical point for the gradient.
This critical point causes the strongest antagonists to lie close to the
decision boundary. This is validated in the loss landscapes of robust neural
networks and cellular decision-making models, and observed experimentally for
immune cells. For both regimes, we explain how associated defence mechanisms
shape the geometry of the loss landscape, and why different adversarial attacks
are effective in different regimes. Our work connects evolved cellular
decision-making to machine learning, and motivates the design of a general
theory of adversarial perturbations, both for in vivo and in silico systems.

main result is an algorithm that, given an $m \times n$ matrix in a data
structure supporting certain $\ell^2$-norm sampling operations, outputs an
$\ell^2$-norm sample from a rank-$k$ approximation of that matrix in time
$O(\text{poly}(k)\log(mn))$, only polynomially slower than the quantum

give an exponential speedup over classical algorithms. Further, under strong
input assumptions, the classical recommendation system resulting from our
algorithm produces recommendations exponentially faster than previous classical
systems, which run in time linear in $m$ and $n$.
  The main insight of this work is the use of simple routines to manipulate
$\ell^2$-norm sampling distributions, which play the role of quantum
superpositions in the classical setting. This correspondence indicates a
potentially fruitful framework for formally comparing quantum machine learning

provide a bridge between the characterization in \cite{berg-porcu} for
covariance functions on spheres cross time and Gneiting's lemma

  We then prove that there is a valid class of covariance functions similar in

\citep{gneiting2002} that replaces the squared Euclidean distance with the
great circle distance. Notably, the provided class is shown to be positive
definite on every $d$-dimensional sphere cross time, while the Gneiting class
is positive definite over $\R^d \times \R$ for fixed $d$ only.
  In this context, we illustrate the value of our adapted Gneiting class by
comparing examples from this class to currently established nonseparable
covariance classes using out-of-sample predictive criteria. These comparisons
are carried out on two climate reanalysis datasets from the National Centers

  The first chapter presents the postulates and results on elementary
perception at various organizational scales of the nervous system and proposes
the hypothesis of an electrodynamic intrinsic nature of consciousness which is
sustained by an analogical code. It underlines the diversity of the learning
mechanisms that sustain the dynamics of perception and consciousness, including
adaptive and homeostatic processes on multiple scales.
  The second chapter investigates the logical aspects of cognition and
consciousness and proposes an axiomatization based on measure and probability
theory. Topos and constructive logic are presented as providing an intrinsic
probabilistic logic, with the long-term aim of avoiding the paradoxical
decomposition induced by the Axiom of Choice. We sketch an elementary procedure
allowing an expression of the information of a mathematical formula a la Godel.
We then present the formalism of information topology and propose that it
provides a preliminary basis for synthesizing the main models of cognition and
consciousness within a formal Gestalt theory. Information topology establishes
a characterization of information theory functions, allowing for a precise
expression of information structures and patterns. It provides a quantification
of the structure of statistical interactions and their expression in terms of
statistical physics and machine learning. Notably, those topological methods
allow conciliation of some of the main theories of consciousness.

between imperfections (site-diluteness) also have been modeled by the Ising
model on a square lattice. It models the forbidden regions into which the
particles are not allowed to enter. The correlations are controlled by an
artificial temperature $T$. The trace of the walkers is shown to be
self-similar, whose fingerprint is the power-law behaviors. The detailed
analysis of the random walker's traces reveal that the (Ising-type)
correlations affect their geometrical properties. At the critical artificial
temperature $T_c$ we observe that the exponent of end-to-end distance $\nu$
becomes $0.807\pm 0.002$. The fractal dimension of the walker's trace is the
other geometrical quantity which scales inversely with the square root of the

define the {\em unitary setting of completed quantum mechanics}, by adding as
intrinsic data to those from Part I (arXiv:1711.08643) the choice of a north
pole N and south pole S in the geometric space. Then we explain that, in the
unitary setting, a complete observable corresponds to a right (or left)
invariant vector field (Hamiltonian field) on the geometric space, and {\em
unitary time evolution} is the flow of such a vector field. This interpretation
is in fact nothing but the Lie group-Lie group algebra correspondence, for a
geometric space that can be interpreted as the Cayley transform of the usual,
Hermitian operator space. In order to clarify the geometric nature of this
setting, we realize the Cayley transform as a member of a natural octahedral
group that can be associated to any triple of pairwise transversal elements.

navigation agent learns an effective policy over a diverse action space in a

computationally efficient stochastic augmentation to enable the learned policy

Hamiltonians. Indeed, whereas linear coupling have been extensively studied,
the scattering processes of electrons with multiple bosonic quasiparticles are
largely unexplored. We focus here on a self-consistent theory in terms of
dressed propagators and generalize the Hedin's equations using the Schwinger
technique of functional derivatives. The method leads to an exact derivation of
the electronic and bosonic self-energies, expressed in terms of a new family of
vertex functions, high order correlators and bosonic and electronic mean-field
potentials. In the electronic case we prove that the mean-field potential is
the $n$th-order extension of the well-known Debye-Waller potential. We also
introduce a bosonic mean-field potential entirely dictated by nonlinear
electron-boson effects. The present scheme, treating electrons and bosons on an
equal footing, demonstrates the full symmetry of the problem. The vertex
functions are shown to have purely electronic and bosonic character as well as
a mixed electron-boson one. These four vertex functions are shown to satisfy a

much more variation in their layer shapes and sizes, and often require
specialized hardware to exploit sparsity for performance improvement. Thus,
many DNN accelerators designed for large DNNs do not perform well on these
models. In this work, we present Eyeriss v2, a DNN accelerator architecture
designed for running compact and sparse DNNs. To deal with the widely varying
layer shapes and sizes, it introduces a highly flexible on-chip network, called
hierarchical mesh, that can adapt to the different amounts of data reuse and
bandwidth requirements of different data types, which improves the utilization
of the computation resources. Furthermore, Eyeriss v2 can process sparse data
directly in the compressed domain for both weights and activations, and
therefore is able to improve both processing speed and energy efficiency with
sparse models. Overall, with sparse MobileNet, Eyeriss v2 in a 65nm CMOS

available on skyscrapers and multi-story buildings poses a challenge for
large-scale integration of solar photovoltaic modules. Conventional
photovoltaics solutions such as silicon solar panels block the visible light
from entering the building rending them unfeasible to cover all building
surfaces. Here, we demonstrate a novel dielectric metasurface (based-on silicon
nitride grating) acting as a planar light concentrator. We integrate this
functional device onto a window glass transmitting visible light while
simultaneously guiding the near infrared portion (NIR) of sunlight to the edges
of the glass window where it can be converted to electricity by a small PV
module. Utilizing the grating design flexibility, we tune the spectra to enable
guiding of the near NIR sunlight portion and realize polarization independence
demonstrated using finite difference time domain simulations. Experimentally,
we observe about 5.25% of optical guiding efficiency in the NIR region
(700-1000 nm), leaving majority of the visible portion to be transmitted for
natural room lighting. Integrating the solar cell at the window edge, we find a
power conversion efficiency of about 4.2% of NIR light on a prototype of area
25 mm 2. We confirm that the majority of the loss is due to the absorption,
scattering and fabrication non-uniformity over large area which can be further
optimized in future. Such a functional window combining renewable energy
generation, with room lighting, and building-envelope reduction could mitigate
urban heat-islanding issues of modern cities.

arrays of disks and proved, by means of the Eisenstein summation, that the
lattice sum $S_2$ is equal to $\pi$ for the square array. Further, it became
clear that such an equality can be treated as a necessary condition of the
macroscopic isotropy of composites governed by the Laplace equation. This
yielded the description of two-dimensional conducting composites by the classic
elliptic functions including the conditionally convergent Eisenstein series.
This paper is devoted to extension of the lattice sums to double periodic
polyanalytic functions. The exact relations and computationally effective
formulae between the polyanalytic and classic lattice sums are established.
Polynomial representations of the lattice sums are obtained. They are a source
of new exact formulae for the lattice sums where the number $\pi$ persists for
macroscopically isotropic composites by our suggestion.

the one hand there are patterns linked to daily human activities. On the other

paper we interpret these time series as matrices, to be visualized as images.
This approach has two advantages: First of all, interpreting such time series
as images enables one to visually integrate across the image and makes it
therefore easier to spot subtle or faint features. Second, the matrix
interpretation also grants elucidation of the underlying structure using
well-established matrix decomposition methods. We will illustrate both these
aspects for data obtained from the German day-ahead market.

  Grading","Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging",,"10.1109/TMI.2018.2851607",,"cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sparse learning has been shown to be effective in solving many real-world
problems. Finding sparse representations is a fundamentally important topic in
many fields of science including signal processing, computer vision, genome
study and medical imaging. One important issue in applying sparse
representation is to find the basis to represent the data,especially in
computer vision and medical imaging where the data is not necessary incoherent.
In medical imaging, clinicians often grade the severity or measure the risk
score of a disease based on images. This process is referred to as medical
image grading. Manual grading of the disease severity or risk score is often
used. However, it is tedious, subjective and expensive. Sparse learning has
been used for automatic grading of medical images for different diseases. In
the grading, we usually begin with one step to find a sparse representation of
the testing image using a set of reference images or atoms from the dictionary.
Then in the second step, the selected atoms are used as references to compute
the grades of the testing images. Since the two steps are conducted
sequentially, the objective function in the first step is not necessarily
optimized for the second step. In this paper, we propose a novel sparse
range-constrained learning(SRCL)algorithm for medical image grading.Different
from most of existing sparse learning algorithms, SRCL integrates the objective
of finding a sparse representation and that of grading the image into one
function. It aims to find a sparse representation of the testing image based on
atoms that are most similar in both the data or feature representation and the
medical grading scores. We apply the new proposed SRCL to CDR computation and
cataract grading. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to
improve the accuracy in cup-to-disc ratio computation and cataract grading.

computer vision community. Methods based on various deep neural networks have
been proposed for image classification, which could be applied to apparel
attributes recognition. An interesting problem raised is how to ensemble these
methods to further improve the accuracy. In this paper, we propose a two-layer
mixture framework for ensemble different networks. In the first layer of this
framework, two types of ensemble learning methods, bagging and boosting, are
separately applied. Different from traditional methods, our bagging process
makes use of the whole training set, not random subsets, to train each model in
the ensemble, where several differentiated deep networks are used to promote
model variance. To avoid the bias of small-scale samples, the second layer only
adopts bagging to mix the results obtained with bagging and boosting in the
first layer. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mixture
framework outperforms any individual network model or either independent
ensemble method in apparel attributes classification.

  Approaches in Magnetoactive Composites","PhD mechanical engineering, University of Nevada, Reno (2015)",,,,"physics.app-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This research investigates dynamic response of tunable periodic structures
and homogenization methods in magnetoelastic composites (MECs). The research on
tunable periodic structures is focused on the design, modeling and
understanding of wave propagation phenomena and the dynamic response of smart
phononic crystals. High amplitude wrinkle formation is employed to study a
one-dimensional phononic crystal slab consists of a thin film bonded to a thick
compliant substrate. Buckling induced surface instability generates a wrinkly
structure triggered by a compressive strain. It is demonstrated that surface
periodic pattern and the corresponding large deformation can control elastic
wave propagation in the low thickness composite slab. Simulation results show
that the periodic wrinkly structure can be used as a smart phononic crystal
which can switch band diagrams of the structure in a transformative manner. A
magnetoactive phononic crystal is proposed which its dynamic properties are
controlled by combined effects of large deformations and an applied magnetic
field. Finite deformations and magnetic induction influence phononic
characteristics of the periodic structure through geometrical pattern
transformation and material properties. A magnetoelastic energy function is
proposed to develop constitutive laws considering large deformations and
magnetic induction in the periodic structure. Analytical and finite element
methods are utilized to compute dispersion relation and band structure of the
phononic crystal for different cases of deformation and magnetic loadings. It
is demonstrated that magnetic induction not only controls the band diagram of
the structure but also has a strong effect on preferential directions of wave
propagation. Moreover, a thermally controlled phononic crystal is designed
using ligaments of bi-materials in the structure.
