classification of complex non-collinear magnetic structures in two-dimensional
materials. The first approach is based on the implementation of the
single-hidden-layer neural network that only relies on the z projections of the
spins. In this setup one needs a limited set of magnetic configurations to
distinguish ferromag- netic, skyrmion and spin spiral phases, as well as their
different combinations in transitional areas of the phase diagram. The network
trained on the configurations for square-lattice Heisenberg model with
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction can classify the magnetic structures obtained
from Monte Carlo calculations for triangular lattice and vice versa. The second
approach we apply, a minimum distance method performs a fast and cheap
classification in cases when a particular configuration is to be assigned to
only one magnetic phase. The methods we propose are also easy to use for
analysis of the numerous experimental data collected with spin-polarized
scanning tunneling microscopy and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy
experiments.

conformal slant submersions (it means the Reeb vector field $\xi$ is a vertical

ferrite materials cannot be integrated into IC fabrication processes, and

that explains incomplete mixing typically observed in transport with
bimolecular reactions. Unlike traditional advection-dispersion-reaction models,
the SADR model describes mechanical and diffusive mixing as two separate
processes. In the SADR model, mechanical mixing is driven by random advective
velocity with the variance given by the coefficient of mechanical dispersion.
The diffusive mixing is modeled as a Fickian diffusion with the effective
diffusion coefficient. We demonstrate that the sum of the two coefficients is
equal to the dispersion coefficients, but only the effective diffusion
coefficient contributes to the mixing-controlled reactions, indicating that
such systems do not get fully mixed at the Representative Elementary Volume
scale where the deterministic equations and dispersion coefficient are defined.
We use the experimental results of Gramling et al. \cite{Gramling} to show that
for transport and bimolecular reactions in porous media, the SADR model is
significantly more accurate than the traditional dispersion model, which
overestimates the concentration of the reaction product by as much as 60\%.

sky-averaged spectrum or maps of its fluctuations, obtained using radio
interferometers - we can obtain information about cosmic dawn, the era when the
first astrophysical sources of light were formed. The recent detection of the
global 21-centimetre spectrum reveals a stronger absorption than the maximum
predicted by existing models, at a confidence level of 3.8 standard deviations.
Here we report that this absorption can be explained by the combination of
radiation from the first stars and excess cooling of the cosmic gas induced by
its interaction with dark matter. Our analysis indicates that the spatial
fluctuations of the 21-centimetre signal at cosmic dawn could be an order of
magnitude larger than previously expected and that the dark-matter particle is
no heavier than several proton masses, well below the commonly predicted mass
of weakly interacting massive particles. Our analysis also confirms that dark
matter is highly non-relativistic and at least moderately cold, and primordial
velocities predicted by models of warm dark matter are potentially detectable.

passage has just occurred in November 2017. In the Swift X-ray light curve, the
flux was steadily increasing before mid-October 2017, however, a sharp X-ray
dip on a weekly time-scale is seen during the periastron passage, followed by a
post-periastron X-ray flare lasting for ~20 days. We suggest that the X-ray dip
is caused by (i) an increase of the magnetization parameter at the shock, and
(ii) the suppression due to the Doppler boosting effect. The 20-day
post-periastron flare could be a consequence of the Be stellar disk passage by
the pulsar. An orbital GeV modulation is also expected in our model, however,
no significant variability is seen in the Fermi-LAT light curve. We suspect
that the GeV emission resulted from the interaction between the binary's
members is hidden behind the bright magnetospheric emission of the pulsar.
Pulsar gating technique would be useful to remove the magnetospheric emission

planets themselves. There is actually circumstantial evidence that most
planetary systems become unstable after the disappearance of gas from the
protoplanetary disk. These instabilities can be due to the original system
being too crowded and too closely packed or to external perturbations such as
tides, planetesimal scattering, or torques from distant stellar companions. The
Solar System was not exceptional in this sense. In its inner part, a crowded
system of planetary embryos became unstable, leading to a series of mutual
impacts that built the terrestrial planets on a timescale of ~100 My. In its
outer part, the giant planets became temporarily unstable and their orbital
configuration expanded under the effect of mutual encounters. A planet might
have been ejected in this phase. Thus, the orbital distributions of planetary
systems that we observe today, both solar and extrasolar ones, can be different
from the those emerging from the formation process and it is important to
consider possible long-term evolutionary effects to connect the two.

received increasing interest from power system utilities to support the
economic and resiliency posture of their systems. The economics of long
distance transmission lines prevent many remote communities from connecting to
bulk transmission systems and these communities rely on off-grid microgrid
technology. Furthermore, communities that are connected to the bulk
transmission system are investigating microgrid technologies that will support
their ability to disconnect and operate independently during extreme events. In
each of these cases, it is important to develop methodologies that support the
capability to design and operate microgrids in the absence of transmission over
long periods of time. Unfortunately, such planning problems tend to be
computationally difficult to solve and those that are straightforward to solve
often lack the modeling fidelity that inspires confidence in the results. To
address these issues, we first develop a high fidelity model for design and
operations of a microgrid that include component efficiencies, component
operating limits, battery modeling, unit commitment, capacity expansion, and
power flow physics; the resulting model is a mixed-integer
quadratically-constrained quadratic program (MIQCQP). We then develop an
iterative algorithm, referred to as the Model Predictive Control (MPC)
algorithm, that allows us to solve the resulting MIQCQP. We show, through
extensive computational experiments, that the MPC-based method can scale to
problems that have a very long planning horizon and provide high quality
solutions that lie within 5\% of optimal.

form larger and larger objects and eventually planets are produced. The initial
conditions are a disc of gas and microscopic solid particles, with a total mass
of about 1% of the gas mass. Accretion has to be effective and fast. Effective,
because the original total mass in solids in the solar protoplanetary disk was
probably of the order of ~ 300 Earth masses, and the mass incorporated into the
planets is ~100 Earth masses. Fast, because the cores of the giant planets had
to grow to tens of Earth masses in order to capture massive doses of hydrogen
and helium from the disc before the dispersal of the latter, i.e. in a few
millions of years. There is probably not one accretion process but several,
depending on the scale at which accretion operates. A first process is the
sticking of microscopic dust into larger grains and pebbles. A second process
is the formation of an intermediate class of objects called planetesimals. A
third accretion process has to lead from planetesimals to planets. Actually,
several processes can be involved in this step, from collisional coagulation
among planetesimals to the accretion of small particles under the effect of gas
drag, to giant impacts between protoplanets. This chapter will detail all these
processes, adopting a historical perspective: i.e. from the classic processes
investigated in the past decades to those unveiled in the last years.

decision tasks, and derives performance expressions and performance operating
curves under challenging conditions with some revealing insights. One of the
main challenges in the analysis is that agents are only allowed to exchange
one-bit messages, and the information at each agent therefore consists of both
continuous and discrete components. Due to this mixed nature, the steady-state
distribution of the state of each agent cannot be inferred from direct
application of central limit arguments. Instead, the behavior of the continuous
component is characterized in integral form by using a log-characteristic
function, while the behavior of the discrete component is characterized by
means of an asymmetric Bernoulli convolution. By exploiting these results, the
article derives reliable approximate performance expressions for the network
nodes that match well with the simulated results for a wide range of system

compatibility, i.e., that truth-telling of all agents is a dominant strategy,
for a static one-shot game. However, in a dynamic environment that unfolds over
time, the agents' intertemporal payoffs depend on the expected future controls
and payments, and a direct extension of the VCG mechanism is not sufficient to
guarantee incentive compatibility. In fact, it does not appear to be feasible
to construct mechanisms that ensure the dominance of dynamic truth-telling for
agents comprised of general stochastic dynamic systems. The contribution of
this paper is to show that such a dynamic stochastic extension does exist for
the special case of Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) agents with a careful
construction of a sequence of layered payments over time. For a set of LQG
agents, we propose a modified layered version of the VCG mechanism for payments
that decouples the intertemporal effect of current bids on future payoffs, and
prove that truth-telling of dynamic states forms a dominant strategy if system
parameters are known and agents are rational.
  An important example of a problem needing such optimal dynamic coordination
of stochastic agents arises in power systems where an Independent System
Operator (ISO) has to ensure balance of generation and consumption at all time
instants, while ensuring social optimality. The challenge is to determine a
bidding scheme between all agents and the ISO that maximizes social welfare,
while taking into account the stochastic dynamic models of agents, since
renewable energy resources such as solar/wind are stochastic and dynamic in
nature, as are consumptions by loads which are influenced by factors such as
local temperatures and thermal inertias of facilities.

solve them using numerical techniques to characterize locally optimal control

the objective, albeit with an unintended consequence. The resulting dynamics
include cycles between low and high resource states - a dynamical regime termed
an ""oscillating tragedy of the commons"". This outcome may have desirable

managed via distributed resource allocation methods. However, as the density of

methods. Yet, unplanned deployment of femtocells requires an adaptable and
self-organizing algorithm to make HetNets viable. As such, we propose to use a
machine learning approach based on Q-learning to solve the resource allocation
problem in such complex networks. By defining each base station as an agent, a
cellular network is modelled as a multi-agent network. Subsequently,
cooperative Q-learning can be applied as an efficient approach to manage the
resources of a multi-agent network. Furthermore, the proposed approach
considers the quality of service (QoS) for each user and fairness in the

than a four-fold increase in the number of supported femtocells while using
cooperative Q-learning to reduce resource allocation overhead.

pre-defined build environments. Due to the need of quality assurance and the
benefit of better detecting attacks against build environments, the practice of
reproducible builds has gained popularity in many open-source software
repositories such as Debian and Bitcoin. However, identifying the
unreproducible issues remains a labour intensive and time consuming challenge,
because of the lacking of information to guide the search and the diversity of
the causes that may lead to the unreproducible binaries.
  In this paper we propose an automated framework called RepLoc to localize the
problematic files for unreproducible builds. RepLoc features a query
augmentation component that utilizes the information extracted from the build
logs, and a heuristic rule-based filtering component that narrows the search
scope. By integrating the two components with a weighted file ranking module,
RepLoc is able to automatically produce a ranked list of files that are helpful
in locating the problematic files for the unreproducible builds. We have
implemented a prototype and conducted extensive experiments over 671 real-world
unreproducible Debian packages in four different categories. By considering the
topmost ranked file only, RepLoc achieves an accuracy rate of 47.09%. If we
expand our examination to the top ten ranked files in the list produced by
RepLoc, the accuracy rate becomes 79.28%. Considering that there are hundreds
of source code, scripts, Makefiles, etc., in a package, RepLoc significantly
reduces the scope of localizing problematic files. Moreover, with the help of
RepLoc, we successfully identified and fixed six new unreproducible packages
from Debian and Guix.

nonclassical properties of radiation fields. Here we describe and analyse how
to apply this concept to the motional state of a mechanical oscillator and
present a full scheme to prepare non-Gaussian {\it phonon}-added coherent
states of the mechanical motion in cavity optomechanics. We first generate a
mechanical coherent state using electromagnetically induced transparency. We
then add a single phonon onto the coherent state via optomechanical parametric
down-conversion combined with single photon detection. We validate this
single-phonon-added coherent state by using a red-detuned beam and reading out
the state of the optical output field. This approach allows us to verify
nonclassical properties of the phonon state, such as sub-Poissonian character
and quadrature squeezing. We further show that our scheme can be directly
implemented using existing devices, and is generic in nature and hence
applicable to a variety of systems in opto- and electromechanics.

SybilFuse, a defense-in-depth framework for Sybil detection when the

the global network structure via weighted random walk and loopy belief
propagation mechanisms. We evaluate our framework on both synthetic and

poorly when the interaction time with the environment is limited, as is the
case for most real-world robotic tasks. In this paper, we study how maximum
entropy policies trained using soft Q-learning can be applied to real-world
robotic manipulation. The application of this method to real-world manipulation
is facilitated by two important features of soft Q-learning. First, soft
Q-learning can learn multimodal exploration strategies by learning policies
represented by expressive energy-based models. Second, we show that policies
learned with soft Q-learning can be composed to create new policies, and that
the optimality of the resulting policy can be bounded in terms of the
divergence between the composed policies. This compositionality provides an
especially valuable tool for real-world manipulation, where constructing new
policies by composing existing skills can provide a large gain in efficiency
over training from scratch. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that soft
Q-learning is substantially more sample efficient than prior model-free deep
reinforcement learning methods, and that compositionality can be performed for
both simulated and real-world tasks.

complementary approach to temporal planning. We extend previous work by
introducing two new problem variations that incorporate important
characteristics identified by the quantum computing community. We apply
temporal planning and CP to the baseline and extended QCC problems as both
stand-alone and hybrid approaches. Our hybrid methods use solutions found by
temporal planning to warm start CP, leveraging the ability of the former to
find satisficing solutions to problems with a high degree of task optionality,
an area that CP typically struggles with. The CP model, benefiting from
inferred bounds on planning horizon length and task counts provided by the warm
start, is then used to find higher quality solutions. Our empirical evaluation
indicates that while stand-alone CP is only competitive for the smallest
problems, CP in our hybridization with temporal planning out-performs
stand-alone temporal planning in the majority of problem classes.

parameter estimation. Moreover, we give an experimental concept of the proposed

molecular clouds using gas-ice astrochemical simulations. We find that the bulk
gas can become depleted in heavy nitrogen (15N) due to the formation of
15N-enriched ices. Around the chemical transition from atomic nitrogen to N2,
N15N is selectively photodissociated, which results in the enrichment of 15N in
atomic nitrogen. As 15N-enriched atomic nitrogen is converted to ammonia ice
via grain surface reactions, the bulk gas is depleted in 15N. The level of 15N
depletion in the bulk gas can be up to a factor of two compared to the
elemental nitrogen isotope ratio, depending on the photodesorption yield of
ammonia ice. Once the nitrogen isotopes are differentially partitioned between
gas and solids in a molecular cloud, it should remain in the later stages of
star formation (e.g., prestellar core) as long as the sublimation of ammonia
ice is inefficient. Our model suggests that all the N-bearing molecules in the
cold gas of star-forming regions can be depleted in 15N, which is at least
qualitatively consistent with the observations toward prestellar core L1544. In
our models, icy species show both 15N and deuterium fractionation. The
fractionation pattern within ice mantles is different between 15N and
deuterium, reflecting their fractionation mechanisms; while the concentration
of deuterium almost monotonically increases from the lower layers of the ice
mantles to the upper layers, the concentration of 15N reaches the maximum at a
certain depth and declines towards the surface.

not: it can identify algebraically the Moebius strip and the cylinder for
example. The cohomology satisfies the Kuenneth formula: the Poincare
polynomials p_k(t) are ring homomorphisms from the strong ring to the ring of

Laplacian L=D^2 which leads to the generalized Hodge correspondence

B(t)=d(t)-d^*(t)-ib(t), D(t)=d(t)+d(t)^* + b(t) can deform the exterior

characteristics: given an endomorphism T of G, the super trace of its induced
map on k'th cohomology defines a Lefschetz number L_k(T). The Brouwer index
i_T,k(x_1,...,x_k) = product_j=1^k w(x_j) sign(T|x_j) attached to simplex tuple
which is invariant under T leads to the formula L_k(T) = sum_T(x)=x i_T,k(x).
For T=Id, the Lefschetz number L_k(Id) is equal to the k'th Wu characteristic
w_k(G) of the graph G and the Lefschetz formula reduces to the Euler-Poincare

hence the Z$_2$-odd right-handed neutrino is stable and the unique dark matter
candidate in the model. The so-called minimal seesaw works with the other two
right-handed neutrinos and reproduces the current neutrino oscillation data. We
consider the case that the dark matter particle communicates with the SM

a lower bound on the $B-L$ gauge coupling ($\alpha_{B-L}$) as a function of the

relic density. On the other hand, we interpret the recent LHC Run-2 results on

complementary to narrow down an allowed parameter region for this ""$Z^{\prime}$

we advocate for the thesis that there is a much deeper relationship between
computational topology and the Unique Games Conjecture. Our starting point is
Linial's 2005 observation that the only known problems whose inapproximability
is equivalent to the Unique Games Conjecture - Unique Games and Max-2Lin - are
instances of Maximum Section of a Covering Space on graphs. We then observe
that the reduction between these two problems (Khot-Kindler-Mossel-O'Donnell,
FOCS 2004; SICOMP, 2007) gives a well-defined map of covering spaces. We
further prove that inapproximability for Maximum Section of a Covering Space on
(cell decompositions of) closed 2-manifolds is also equivalent to the Unique
Games Conjecture. This gives the first new ""Unique Games-complete"" problem in
over a decade.
  Our results partially settle an open question of Chen and Freedman (SODA
2010; Disc. Comput. Geom., 2011) from computational topology, by showing that
their question is almost equivalent to the Unique Games Conjecture. (The main
difference is that they ask for inapproximability over
$\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, and we show Unique Games-completeness over
$\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}$ for large $k$.) This equivalence comes from the fact
that when the structure group $G$ of the covering space is Abelian - or more
generally for principal $G$-bundles - Maximum Section of a $G$-Covering Space
is the same as the well-studied problem of 1-Homology Localization.
  Although our most technically demanding result is an application of Unique
Games to computational topology, we hope that our observations on the
topological nature of the Unique Games Conjecture will lead to applications of
algebraic topology to the Unique Games Conjecture in the future.

learning in the setting where we have access to an external, domain-mismatched
dataset of paired speech and articulatory measurements, either with or without

Distributed algorithms proposed in the literature aim to maximize the network

these algorithms work under the assumption that all the SUs faithfully follow
the algorithms which may not always hold due to the decentralized nature of the

launching coordinated and uncoordinated attacks. In the coordinated attack, the
jammers select non-overlapping channels to attack in each time slot and can
significantly increase the number of collisions for SUs. We setup the problem
in each scenario as a multi-player bandit and develop algorithms. The analysis
shows that when the SUs faithfully implement proposed algorithms, the regret is
constant with high probability. We validate our claims through exhaustive

oriented matroids $f:\mathcal{M}_1\rightarrow\mathcal{M}_2$ can be factored
into extensions and contractions. The conjecture is known to be false due to a
construction by Richter-Gebert, he find a non-factorizable strong map
$f:\mathcal{M}_1\rightarrow\mathcal{M}_2$, however in his example
$\mathcal{M}_1$ is not realizable. The problem that whether there exists a
non-factorizable strong map between realizable oriented matroids still remains
open. In this paper we provide a counterexample to the strong map conjecture on
realizable oriented matroids, which is a strong map
$f:\mathcal{M}_1\rightarrow\mathcal{M}_2$, $\mathcal{M}_1$ is an alternating
oriented matroid of rank $4$ and $f$ has corank $2$. We prove it is not
factorizable by showing that there is no uniform oriented matroid
$\mathcal{M}^{\prime}$ of rank $3$ such that
$\mathcal{M}_1\rightarrow\mathcal{M}^{\prime}\rightarrow\mathcal{M}_2$.

suggests that the observed terahertz radiation originates from the

the current-induced terahertz radiation and its phase control by the circular

approach overcomes the limitation of many traditional methods, such as
generalised polynomial chaos methods, which may lack sufficient accuracy when
the quantity of interest depends discontinuously on the input parameters. As a
remedy we propose an adaptive sampling algorithm based on minimum spanning
trees combined with a domain decomposition method based on support vector
machines. The minimum spanning tree determines new sample locations based on
both the probability density of the input parameters and the gradient in the
quantity of interest. The support vector machine efficiently decomposes the
random space in multiple elements, avoiding the appearance of Gibbs phenomena
near discontinuities. On each element, local approximations are constructed by
means of least orthogonal interpolation, in order to produce stable
interpolation on the unstructured sample set. The resulting minimum spanning
tree multi-element method does not require initial knowledge of the behaviour
of the quantity of interest and automatically detects whether discontinuities
are present. We present several numerical examples that demonstrate accuracy,
efficiency and generality of the method.

Wall Problem (EWP), i.e., an exponential increase in the dimensions of Hilbert
space with $N$. Therefore they loose their meaning for macroscopic systems, a
point stressed in particular by W. Kohn. The EWP has to be resolved in order to
be able to perform electronic structure calculations, e.g., for solids. The
origin of the EWP is the multiplicative property of wavefunctions when
independent subsystems are considered. Therefore it can only be avoided when
wavefunctions are formulated so that they are additive instead, in particular
when matrix elements involving them are calculated. We describe how this is
done for the ground state of a macroscopic electron system. Going over from a
multiplicative to an additive quantity requires taking a logarithm. Here it
implies going over from Hilbert space to the operator- or Liouville space with
a metric based on cumulants. The operators which define the ground-state
wavefunction generate fluctuations from a mean-field state. The latter does not
suffer from an EWP and therefore may serve as a vacuum state. The fluctuations
have to be {\it connected} like the ones caused by pair interactions in a
classical gas when the free energy is calculated (Meyer's cluster expansion).
This fixes the metric in Liouville space. The scheme presented here provides a
solid basis for electronic structure calculations for the ground state of
solids. In fact, its applicability has already been proven. We discuss also
matrix product states, which have been applied to one-dimensional systems with
results of high precision. Although these states are formulated in Hilbert
space they are processed by using operators in Liouville space. We show that
they fit into the general formalism described above.

have shown their promising potential in energy and environmental applications.
In this work, we predict a new type of carbon nitride network with a C$_9$N$_4$
stoichiometry from first principle calculations. Unlike common C-N compounds
and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which are typically insulating,
surprisingly C$_9$N$_4$ is found to be a 2D nodal-line semimetal (NLSM). The
nodal line in C$_9$N$_4$ forms a closed ring centered at $\Gamma$ point, which
originates from the pz orbitals of both C and N. The linear crossing happens
right at Fermi level contributed by two sets of dispersive Kagome and Dirac
bands, which is robust due to negligible spin-orbital-coupling (SOC) in C and
N. Besides, it is revealed that the formation of nodal ring is of accidental
band degeneracy in nature induced by the chemical potential difference of C and
N, as validated by a single orbital tight-binding model, rather than protected
by crystal in-plane mirror symmetry or band topology. Interestingly, a new
structure of nodal line, i.e., nodal-cylinder, is found in momentum space for
AA-stacking C$_9$N$_4$. Our results imply possible functionalization for a

costly financial transactions between providers. Agents in CRBS not only
strengthen the trading relationship among providers but also enable them to
handle surges in demand with their primary setup. Unlike existing systems, CRBS
assigns resources by considering resource urgency which comparatively improves
customers satisfaction and the resource utilization rate by more than 50%.The
evaluation results provide evidence that our system assists providers to timely
acquire the additional resources and to maintain sustainable service delivery.
We conclude that the existence of such a system is economically beneficial for
cloud providers and enables them to adapt to fluctuating workloads.

astronomers over half a century. Solar magneto-seismology (SMS) provides a

study the evolution of oscillations of a coronal loop observed by the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). We measure geometric and physical
parameters of the loop oscillations. In particular, we find that the mean
period of the oscillations increased from 1048 to 1264 s during three
oscillatory cycles. We employ the differential emission measure method and
apply the tools of SMS. The evolution of densities inside and outside the loop
is analyzed. We found that an increase of density inside the loop and decrease
of the magnetic field strength along the loop are the main reasons for the
increase in the period during the oscillations. Besides, we also found that the
amplitude profile of the loop is different from a profile would it be a
homogeneous loop. It is proposed that the distribution of magnetic strength
along the loop rather than density stratification is responsible for this
deviation. The variation in period and distribution of amplitude provide, in
terms of SMS, a new and unprecedented insight into coronal loop diagnostics.

in cosmological tests. Previously, a catalog of 69 such systems was used in a
one-on-one comparison between the standard model, LCDM, and the R_h=ct
universe, which has thus far been favored by the application of model selection
tools to many other kinds of data. But in that work, the use of model
parametric fits to the observations could not easily distinguish between these
two cosmologies, in part due to the limited measurement precision. Here, we
instead use recently developed methods based on Gaussian Processes (GP), in
which D_obs may be reconstructed directly from the data without assuming any
parametric form. This approach not only smooths out the reconstructed function
representing the data, but also reduces the size of the 1-sigma confidence
regions, thereby providing greater power to discern between different models.
With the current sample size, we show that analyzing strong lenses with a GP
approach can definitely improve the model comparisons, producing probability
differences in the range ~10-30%. These results are still marginal, however,
given the relatively small sample. Nonetheless, we conclude that the
probability of R_h=ct being the correct cosmology is somewhat higher than that
of LCDM, with a degree of significance that grows with the number of sources in
the subsamples we consider. Future surveys will significantly grow the catalog
of strong lenses and will therefore benefit considerably from the GP method we
describe here. In addition, we point out that if the R_h=ct universe is
eventually shown to be the correct cosmology, the lack of free parameters in
the study of strong lenses should provide a remarkably powerful tool for
uncovering the mass structure in lensing galaxies.

process of the model, recent study shows that the spectral measure induced by
the regression coefficient vector with respect to the covariance matrix of
$X_n$ is close to a uniform measure in purely causal cases, but it differs from
a uniform measure characteristically in the presence of a scalar confounder.
Then, analyzing spectral measure pattern could help to detect confounding. In
this paper, we propose to use the first moment of the spectral measure for
confounder detection. We calculate the first moment of the regression vector
induced spectral measure, and compare it with the first moment of a uniform
spectral measure, both defined with respect to the covariance matrix of $X_n$.
The two moments coincide in non-confounding cases, and differ from each other
in the presence of confounding. This statistical causal-confounding asymmetry
can be used for confounder detection. Without the need of analyzing the
spectral measure pattern, our method does avoid the difficulty of metric choice
and multiple parameter optimization. Experiments on synthetic and real data
show the performance of this method.

unconstrained multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) consists of Pareto
critical points of subproblems considering subsets of the objective functions.
If the Pareto critical set is completely described by its boundary (e.g. if we
have more objective functions than dimensions in the parameter space), this can
be used to solve the MOP by solving a number of MOPs with fewer objective
functions. If this is not the case, the results can still give insight into the
structure of the Pareto critical set. This technique is especially useful for
efficiently solving many-objective optimization problems by breaking them down
into MOPs with a reduced number of objective functions.

investigated in the framework of equivariant Riemannian geometry, which reduces
the study of trajectories of three-body motions to the study of their moduli
curves, that is, curves which record the change of size and shape, in the
moduli space of oriented mass-triangles. The latter space is a Riemannian cone
over the shape 2-sphere, and the shape curve is the image curve on this sphere.
It is shown that the time parametrized moduli curve is in general determined by
the relative geometry of the shape curve and the shape potential function. This
also entails the reconstruction of time, namely the geometric shape curve
determines the time parametrization of the moduli curve, hence also the
three-body motion itself, modulo a fixed rotation of the plane. The first

scientific workflow execution. It provides dynamic, on-demand and scalable
resources that enable the processing of complex workflow-based experiments.
With the ever growing size of the experimental data and increasingly complex
processing workflows, the need for reproducibility has also become essential.
Provenance has been thought of a mechanism to verify a workflow and to provide
workflow reproducibility. One of the obstacles in reproducing an experiment
execution is the lack of information about the execution infrastructure in the
collected provenance. This information becomes critical in the context of Cloud
in which resources are provisioned on-demand and by specifying resource
configurations. Therefore, a mechanism is required that enables capturing of
infrastructure information along with the provenance of workflows executing on
the Cloud to facilitate the re-creation of execution environment on the Cloud.
This paper presents a framework, ReCAP, along with the proposed mapping
approaches that aid in capturing the Cloud-aware provenance information and
help in re-provisioning the execution resource on the Cloud with similar
configurations. Experimental evaluation has shown the impact of different
resource configurations on the workflow execution performance, therefore
justifies the need for collecting such provenance information in the context of
Cloud. The evaluation has also demonstrated that the proposed mapping
approaches can capture Cloud information in various Cloud usage scenarios
without causing performance overhead and can also enable the re-provisioning of
resources on Cloud. Experiments were conducted using workflows from different
scientific domains such as astronomy and neuroscience to demonstrate the
applicability of this research for different workflows.

closed loops in momentum space. If such loops can proliferate and link
intricately, NLSMs become exotic topological phases with unconventional
topological characteristics and potentially peculiar transport properties. In
conventional quantum materials or cold atom systems alike, such exotic phases
necessarily require non-local hopping and are therefore intrinsically
unrealistic. In this work, we show how this hurdle can be surmounted through an
experimentally feasible periodic driving scheme. In particular, by tuning the
period of a two-step periodic driving or some experimentally accessible
parameters, we show how to generate arbitrarily many nodal loops that are
linked with various levels of complexity. Furthermore, we propose to use both
the Berry phase winding and the Alexander polynomial topological invariant to
characterize the fascinating linkages among the nodal loops. This work thus
presents a class of exotic Floquet topological phase that has hitherto not been
proposed in any realistic setup.

the power of the noiseless received signal lying on an unbounded DPCIR is an

along with a representation in a simplified 2D-motion landscape based on the
Principal Components (PCs) from experimental structures. For a conformationally
rich ensemble, the PCs provide powerful reaction coordinates for automatic
structure classification, detection of on-pathway intermediates and validation
of in silico pathways. When the number of available structures is low or
sampling is limited, Normal Modes (NMs) provide alternative motion axes for
trajectory analysis. The path-generation eBDIMS method is available at a
user-friendly website: https://login.biophysics.kth.se/eBDIMS/ or as standalone

[Lin&Sahni: Fair edge deletion problems. IEEE Trans. Comput. 89]. The measure

of MSO Fair Vertex Evaluation for formulas with l free variables; here we
measure a maximum number of neighbors in each of the l sets. However, such

the simplest problems with respect to the demanded property (i.e., the rest

scenarios in viscoelastic channel and Couette flow, and may also play an
important role when such flows are fully turbulent. As such, it is of interest
to assess how this amplification, defined as the steady-state variance
maintained under Gaussian white noise forcing, scales with the main
nondimensional parameters: the Reynolds ($Re$) and Weissenberg ($Wi$) numbers.
This scaling is derived analytically in the two limits of strong and weak
elasticity for when the forcing is streamwise-constant. The latter is the
relevant forcing for capturing the overall behaviour because it was previously
shown to have the dominant contribution to amplification. The final expressions
show that for weak elasticity the scaling retains a form similar to the
well-known O($Re^3$) relationship with an added elastic correction. For strong
elasticity, however, the scaling is O($Wi^3$) with a viscous correction. The
key factor leading to such a mirroring in the scaling is the introduction of
forcing in the polymer stress. The results demonstrate that energy
amplification in a viscoelastic flow can be very sensitive to the model
parameters even at low $Re$. They also suggest that energy amplification can be
significantly increased by forcing the polymer stress, thereby opening up
possibilities such as flow control using systematically designed polymer stress
perturbations.

propositions, Quantum Theories can be formulated in real, complex or
quaternionic Hilbert spaces as established in Sol\'er's theorem. The said
lattice eventually coincides with the lattice of all orthogonal projectors on a
separable Hilbert space over R, C, or over the algebra of quaternions H.
Quantum states are $\sigma$-additive probability measures on that non-Boolean
lattice. Gleason's theorem proves that, if the Hilbert space is separable with
dimension >2 and the Hilbert space is either real or complex, then states are
one-to-one with standard density matrices (self-adjoint, positive, unit-trace,
trace-class operators). The extension of this result to quaternionic Hilbert
spaces was obtained by Varadarajan in 1968. Unfortunately, even if the hard
part of the proof is correct, the formulation of this extension is
mathematically incorrect. This is due to some peculiarities of the notion of
trace in quaternionic Hilbert spaces, e.g., basis dependence, making the theory
of trace-class operators in quaternionic Hilbert spaces different from the
standard theory in real and complex Hilbert spaces. A minor issue also affects
Varadarajan's statement for real Hilbert space formulation. This paper is
mainly devoted to present Gleason-Varadarajan's theorem into a technically
correct form valid for the three types of Hilbert spaces. After having develped
part of the general mathematical technology of trace-class operators in
(generally non-separable) quaternionic Hilbert spaces, we prove that only the
{\em real part} of the trace enters the formalism of quantum theories (also
dealing with unbounded observables and symmetries) and it can be safely used to
formulate and prove a common statement of Gleason's theorem.

the lepton- and hadron-side forward-backward asymmetries, denoted by
$A^\ell_{FB}$ and $A^{\Lambda}_{FB}$, respectively in the range $15 < q^2(=s) <
20$ GeV$^2$ with 3 fb$^{-1}$ of data. Motivated by these measurements, we
perform an analysis of $q^2$ dependent $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda (\to p \pi )
\mu^+\mu^-$ angular observables at large- and low-recoil in the SM and in a
family non-universal $Z^{\prime}$ model. In the present study we use the
recently performed high-precision lattice QCD calculations of the form factors
that have well controlled uncertainties especially in $15 < s < 20$ GeV$^2$
bin. Using the full four-folded angular distribution of $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda
(\to p \pi ) \mu^+\mu^-$ decay, firstly we calculate the values of these
measured quantitites in the SM and compare their numerical values with the
measurements in appropriate bins of $s$. In case of the possible discrepancy
between the SM prediction and measurements, we try to see if these can be
accommodated though the extra neutral $Z^{\prime}$ boson. In addition, the
fraction of longitudinal polarization of the dimuon $F_{L}$ is measured to be
$0.61^{+0.11}_{-0.14}\pm 0.03$ in $15 < s < 20$ GeV$^2$ at the LHCb. We find
that in this bin the value found in the $Z^{\prime}$ model is close to the
observed values. After comparing the results of these observables, we have
proposed a number of other observables whose values are calculated in different
bins of $s$ in the SM and $Z^{\prime}$ model. We illustrate that the
experimental observations of these observables in several bins of $s$ can help
to test the predictions of the SM and unravel NP contributions arises due to
$Z^{\prime}$ model in these decays.

considering the recovery of arbitrary m-dimensional real random vectors x from
the noiseless linear measurements y=Ax with n x m measurement matrix A. Our
theory is inspired by the groundbreaking work of Wu and Verdu (2010) on almost
lossless analog compression, but applies to the nonasymptotic, i.e., fixed-m
case, and considers zero error probability. Specifically, our achievability
result states that, for almost all A, the random vector x can be recovered with
zero error probability provided that n > K(x), where K(x) is given by the
infimum of the lower modified Minkowski dimension over all support sets U of x.
We then particularize this achievability result to the class of s-rectifiable
random vectors as introduced in Koliander et al. (2016); these are random
vectors of absolutely continuous distribution---with respect to the
s-dimensional Hausdorff measure---supported on countable unions of
s-dimensional differentiable submanifolds of the m-dimensional real coordinate
space. Countable unions of differentiable submanifolds include essentially all
signal models used in the compressed sensing literature. Specifically, we prove
that, for almost all A, s-rectifiable random vectors x can be recovered with
zero error probability from n>s linear measurements. This threshold is,
however, found not to be tight as exemplified by the construction of an
s-rectifiable random vector that can be recovered with zero error probability
from n<s linear measurements. This leads us to the introduction of the new
class of s-analytic random vectors, which admit a strong converse in the sense
of n greater than or equal to s being necessary for recovery with probability
of error smaller than one. The central conceptual tools in the development of
our theory are geometric measure theory and the theory of real analytic
functions.

on March 21, 2015. Studies at UV wavelengths showed spectral lines of freshly
produced Be-7. This could be measurable also in gamma-rays at 478 keV from the
decay to Li-7. Novae are also expected to synthesise Na-22 which decays to
Ne-22, emitting a 1275 keV photon. About one week before the optical maximum, a
strong gamma-ray flash on time-scales of hours is expected from short-lived
radioactive nuclei, such as N-13 and F-18. These beta-plus-unstable nuclei
should yield emission up to 511 keV, but which has never been observed. The
spectrometer SPI aboard INTEGRAL pointed towards V5668 by chance. We use these
observations to search for possible gamma-ray emission of decaying Be-7, and to
directly measure the synthesised mass during explosive burning. We also aim to
constrain possible burst-like emission days to weeks before the optical maximum
using the SPI anticoincidence shield (ACS). We extract spectral and temporal
information to determine the fluxes of gamma-ray lines at 478 keV, 511 keV, and
1275 keV. A measured flux value directly converts into abundances produced by
the nova. The SPI-ACS rates are analysed for burst-like emission using a nova
model light-curve. For the obtained nova flash candidate events, we discuss
possible origins. No significant excess for the expected gamma-ray lines is
found. Our upper limits on the synthesised Be-7 and Na-22 mass depend on the
uncertainties of the distance to the nova: The Be-7 mass is constrained to less
than $4.8\times10^{-9}\,(d/kpc)^2$, and Na-22 to less than
$2.4\times10^{-8}\,(d/kpc)^2$ solar masses. For the Be-7 mass estimate from UV
studies, the distance to V5668 Sgr must be larger than 1.2 kpc. During three
weeks before the optical maximum, we find 23 burst-like events in the ACS rate,
of which six could possibly be associated with V5668 Sgr.

(AGN) using the normalised excess variance (${\sigma^2_{\rm NXS}}$) parameter
have shown that variability has a strong anti-correlation with black hole mass
($M_{\rm BH}$) and X-ray luminosity ($L_{\rm X}$). In this study we confirm
these previous correlations and find no evidence of a redshift evolution. Using
observations from XMM-Newton, we determine the ${\sigma^2_{\rm NXS}}$ and
$L_{\rm X}$ for a sample of 1091 AGN drawn from the XMM-Newton Cluster Survey
(XCS) - making this the largest study of X-ray spectral properties of AGNs. We
created light-curves in three time-scales; 10 ks, 20 ks and 40 ks and used
these to derive scaling relations between ${\sigma^2_{\rm NXS}}$, $L_{\rm X}$
(2.0-10 keV range) and literature estimates of $M_{\rm BH}$ from reverberation
mapping. We confirm the anti-correlation between $M_{\rm BH}$ and
${\sigma^2_{\rm NXS}}$ and find a positive correlation between $M_{\rm BH}$ and
$L_{\rm X}$. The use of ${\sigma^2_{\rm NXS}}$ is practical only for pointed
observations where the observation time is tens of kiloseconds. For much
shorter observations one cannot accurately quantify variability to estimate
$M_{\rm BH}$. Here we describe a method to derive $L_{\rm X}$ from short
duration observations and used these results as an estimate for $M_{\rm BH}$.
We find that it is possible to estimate $L_{\rm X}$ from observations of just a
few hundred seconds and that when correlated with $M_{\rm BH}$, the relation is
statistically similar to the relation of $M_{\rm BH}$-$L_{\rm X}$ derived from
a spectroscopic analysis of full XMM observations. This method may be
particularly useful to the eROSITA mission, an all-sky survey, which will
detect $>$10$^{6}$ AGN.

captures the frequency dependence of transmission lines and cables, it is
non-linear due to the constant power behavior of the converter terminals using
droop regulation, and presents a suitable degree of simplifications of the MMC
converters, under given conditions, to allow system level studies over

of the equilibrium point is demonstrated by returning the analysis to a

stability of the equilibrium is analyzed by obtaining a Lyapunov function by
the Krasovskii's theorem. Computational results obtained for the selected 4

The first observations of sunspots were sometimes mistaken for transits of

Because observations of Venus transits could give a way to determine the

objects which actually do not exist were searched by their hypothetical
transits on the Sun, as some examples a Venus satellite and an infra-mercurial

prerequisite for the creation of maps with high precision, necessary for
autonomous driving, infrastructure monitoring, lane-wise traffic management,
and urban planning. Lane markings are one of the important components of such
maps. Lane markings convey the rules of roads to drivers. While these rules are
learned by humans, an autonomous driving vehicle should be taught to learn them
to localize itself. Therefore, accurate and reliable lane marking semantic
segmentation in the imagery of roads and highways is needed to achieve such
goals. We use airborne imagery which can capture a large area in a short period
of time by introducing an aerial lane marking dataset. In this work, we propose
a Symmetric Fully Convolutional Neural Network enhanced by Wavelet Transform in
order to automatically carry out lane marking segmentation in aerial imagery.
Due to a heavily unbalanced problem in terms of number of lane marking pixels
compared with background pixels, we use a customized loss function as well as a
new type of data augmentation step. We achieve a very high accuracy in
pixel-wise localization of lane markings without using 3rd-party information.
In this work, we introduce the first high-quality dataset used within our
experiments which contains a broad range of situations and classes of lane
markings representative of current transportation systems. This dataset will be
publicly available and hence, it can be used as the benchmark dataset for
future algorithms within this domain.

algorithm is an efficient algorithm for detecting degenerate predicates. We
study degeneracy detection in constructing the free space of a polyhedron that
rotates around a fixed axis and translates freely relative to another
polyhedron. The structure of the free space is determined by the signs of
univariate polynomials, called angle polynomials, whose coefficients are
polynomials in the coordinates of the vertices of the polyhedra. Every
predicate is expressible as the sign of an angle polynomial $f$ evaluated at a
zero $t$ of an angle polynomial $g$. A predicate is degenerate (the sign is
zero) when $t$ is a zero of a common factor of $f$ and $g$. We present an
efficient degeneracy detection algorithm based on a one-time factoring of every
possible angle polynomial. Our algorithm is 3500 times faster than the standard
algorithm based on greatest common divisor computation. It reduces the share of
degeneracy detection in our free space computations from 90% to 0.5% of the
running time.

To avoid the occurrence of large-scale instability in interacting dark energy
cosmology, we adopt the parameterized post-Friedmann approach to calculate the
perturbation evolution of dark energy. We employ observational data, including
the Planck cosmic microwave background temperature and polarization data,
baryon acoustic oscillation data, a JLA sample of type Ia supernovae
observation, direct measurement of the Hubble constant, and redshift space
distortion data. We find that, compared with those in the $\Lambda$CDM model,
much looser constraints on $\sum m_{\nu}$ are obtained in the $Q=\beta
H\rho_{\rm c}$ model, whereas slightly tighter constraints are obtained in the
$Q=\beta H\rho_{\Lambda}$ model. Consideration of the possible mass hierarchies
of neutrinos reveals that the smallest upper limit of $\sum m_{\nu}$ appears in
the degenerate hierarchy case. By comparing the values of $\chi^2_{\rm min}$,
we find that the normal hierarchy case is favored over the inverted one. In
particular, we find that the difference $\Delta \chi^2_{\rm min} \equiv
\chi^2_{\rm IH; min}-\chi^2_{\rm NH; min}> 2$ in the $Q=\beta H\rho_{\rm c}$
model. In addition, we find that $\beta=0$ is consistent with the current

it employs convolutional neural network to learn features and hashing codes
simultaneously. However, these methods are mostly supervised. In real-world
application, it is a time-consuming and overloaded task for annotating a large
number of images. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised deep hashing
method for large-scale image retrieval. Our method, namely unsupervised
semantic deep hashing (\textbf{USDH}), uses semantic information preserved in
the CNN feature layer to guide the training of network. We enforce four
criteria on hashing codes learning based on VGG-19 model: 1) preserving
relevant information of feature space in hashing space; 2) minimizing
quantization loss between binary-like codes and hashing codes; 3) improving the
usage of each bit in hashing codes by using maximum information entropy, and 4)
invariant to image rotation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, NUSWIDE have
demonstrated that \textbf{USDH} outperforms several state-of-the-art
unsupervised hashing methods for image retrieval. We also conduct experiments
on Oxford 17 datasets for fine-grained classification to verify its efficiency
for other computer vision tasks.

database containing billions of electronic market quotes and transactions for
US equities, we uncover nonparametric evidence for the existence of a universal
and stationary price formation mechanism relating the dynamics of supply and
demand for a stock, as revealed through the order book, to subsequent
variations in its market price. We assess the model by testing its
out-of-sample predictions for the direction of price moves given the history of
price and order flow, across a wide range of stocks and time periods. The
universal price formation model is shown to exhibit a remarkably stable
out-of-sample prediction accuracy across time, for a wide range of stocks from
different sectors. Interestingly, these results also hold for stocks which are
not part of the training sample, showing that the relations captured by the
model are universal and not asset-specific.
  The universal model --- trained on data from all stocks --- outperforms, in
terms of out-of-sample prediction accuracy, asset-specific linear and nonlinear
models trained on time series of any given stock, showing that the universal
nature of price formation weighs in favour of pooling together financial data
from various stocks, rather than designing asset- or sector-specific models as
commonly done. Standard data normalizations based on volatility, price level or
average spread, or partitioning the training data into sectors or categories
such as large/small tick stocks, do not improve training results. On the other
hand, inclusion of price and order flow history over many past observations is
shown to improve forecasting performance, showing evidence of path-dependence
in price dynamics.

equations and, in particular, in the phase and amplitude modes (i.e. Goldstone
and Higgs modes) of the bosonic matter field. We show that the coupling between
phase and amplitude modes gives rise to a single gapless Bogoliubov spectrum in
the non-relativistic case. Instead, in the relativistic case the spectrum has
two branches: one is gapless and the other is gapped. In the non-relativistic
limit we find that the relativistic spectrum reduces to the Bogoliubov one.
Finally, as an application of the above analysis, we consider the Bose-Hubbard

the elementary excitations of its effective action, which contains both
non-relativistic and relativistic terms.

physical infrastructure with a slight disadvantage: they also hide their
internal working details. Should users need knowledge about these details e.g.,
to increase the reliability or performance of their applications, they would
need solutions to detect behavioural changes in the underlying system. Existing
runtime solutions for such purposes offer limited capabilities as they are
mostly restricted to revealing weekly or yearly behavioural periodicity in the
infrastructure. This article proposes a technique for predicting generic
background workload by means of simulations that are capable of providing
additional knowledge of the underlying private cloud systems in order to
support activities like cloud orchestration or workflow enactment. Our
technique uses long-running scientific workflows and their behaviour
discrepancies and tries to replicate these in a simulated cloud with known
(trace-based) workloads. We argue that the better we can mimic the current
discrepancies the better we can tell expected workloads in the near future on
the real life cloud. We evaluated the proposed prediction approach with a
biochemical application on both real and simulated cloud infrastructures. The

the equation of state between the fluid pressure and density is of the type of
the van der Waals equation, it is found that our universe may end in dust. And,
also, it is seen that the behavior of the deceleration parameter is almost
compatible with the recent observation.

fluences of a few $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ and energies between 3.5 and 27 MeV for
isochronal annealing between 80 and 280{\deg}C, are presented. A method based
on SRH (Shockley-Read-Hall) statistics is introduced, which assumes that the
ionisation energy of the defects in a cluster depends on the fraction of
occupied traps. The dfference of ionisation energy of an isolated point defect
and a fully occupied cluster, $\Delta E_a$, is extracted from the TSC data.
  For the VOi (vacancy-oxygen interstitial) defect $\Delta E_a = 0$ is found,
which cofirms that it is a point defect, and validates the method for point
defects. For clusters made of deep acceptors the $\Delta E_a$ values for
different defects are determined after annealing at 80{\deg}C as a function of
electron energy, and for the irradiation with 15 MeV electrons as a function of
annealing temperature. For the irradiation with 3.5 MeV electrons the value
$\Delta E_a = 0$ is found, whereas for the electron energies of 6 to 27 MeV
$\Delta E_a > 0$. This agrees with the expected threshold of about 5 MeV for
cluster formation by electrons. The $\Delta E_a$ values determined as a
function of annealing temperature show that the annealing rate is different for
different defects. A naive diffusion model is used to estimate the temperature
dependencies of the diffusion of the defects in the clusters.

depending on the sign of the interactions, either display particles of opposite

upon subjecting the system to a quench, where an instantaneous edge-to-edge

new performance bottlenecks throughout the memory hierarchy of GPU-based

sources of interference throughout the memory hierarchy.
  We introduce changes to the memory hierarchy for systems with GPUs that allow
the memory hierarchy to be aware of both CPU and GPU applications'
characteristics. We introduce mechanisms to dynamically analyze different
applications' characteristics and propose four major changes throughout the
memory hierarchy. We propose changes to the cache management and memory
scheduling mechanisms to mitigate intra-application interference in GPGPU
applications. We propose changes to the memory controller design and its
scheduling policy to mitigate inter-application interference in heterogeneous
CPU-GPU systems. We redesign the MMU and the memory hierarchy in GPUs to be

interference. We introduce a hardware-software cooperative technique that
modifies the memory allocation policy to enable large page support in order to
further reduce the inter-address-space interference at the shared Translation
Lookaside Buffer (TLB). Our evaluations show that the GPU-aware cache and
memory management techniques proposed in this dissertation are effective at
mitigating the interference caused by GPUs on current and future GPU-based

the activation of a single unit or some linear combination of units in response
to some input) have been highlighted, but their importance has not been
evaluated. Here, we connect these lines of inquiry to demonstrate that a
network's reliance on single directions is a good predictor of its
generalization performance, across networks trained on datasets with different
fractions of corrupted labels, across ensembles of networks trained on datasets
with unmodified labels, across different hyperparameters, and over the course
of training. While dropout only regularizes this quantity up to a point, batch
normalization implicitly discourages single direction reliance, in part by
decreasing the class selectivity of individual units. Finally, we find that
class selectivity is a poor predictor of task importance, suggesting not only
that networks which generalize well minimize their dependence on individual
units by reducing their selectivity, but also that individually selective units
may not be necessary for strong network performance.

sample size largely exceeds the number of variables, fitting a logistic model
produces estimates that are approximately unbiased. Every student also learns
that there are formulas to predict the variability of these estimates which are
used for the purpose of statistical inference; for instance, to produce
p-values for testing the significance of regression coefficients. Although
these formulas come from large sample asymptotics, we are often told that we
are on reasonably safe grounds when $n$ is large in such a way that $n \ge 5p$
or $n \ge 10p$. This paper shows that this is far from the case, and
consequently, inferences routinely produced by common software packages are
often unreliable.
  Consider a logistic model with independent features in which $n$ and $p$
become increasingly large in a fixed ratio. Then we show that (1) the MLE is
biased, (2) the variability of the MLE is far greater than classically
predicted, and (3) the commonly used likelihood-ratio test (LRT) is not
distributed as a chi-square. The bias of the MLE is extremely problematic as it
yields completely wrong predictions for the probability of a case based on
observed values of the covariates. We develop a new theory, which
asymptotically predicts (1) the bias of the MLE, (2) the variability of the
MLE, and (3) the distribution of the LRT. We empirically also demonstrate that
these predictions are extremely accurate in finite samples. Further, an
appealing feature is that these novel predictions depend on the unknown
sequence of regression coefficients only through a single scalar, the overall
strength of the signal. This suggests very concrete procedures to adjust
inference; we describe one such procedure learning a single parameter from data
and producing accurate inference

Lempel-Ziv based entropic measures allows to study thoroughly the complex
patterns appearing in the system for different values of the control
parameters. Such behaviors, resembling cellular automata, have been
characterized both spatially and temporally. Information distance is used to
study the stability of the system to perturbations in the initial conditions
and in the control parameters. The latter is not an issue in cellular automata
theory, where the rules form a numerable set, contrary to the continuous nature
of the parameter space in the system studied in this contribution. The
variation in the density of the digits, as a function of time is also studied.
Local transitions in the control parameter space are also discussed.

increasingly large number of flat directions. At large times, when the loss is
approaching zero, the system diffuses at the bottom of the landscape. Despite
some similarities with the dynamics of mean-field glassy systems, in

suggesting the existence of different phases depending on whether the network

distributed over a network of p2p-interacting ARM-based single-board devices.
We compare Cubbit's distributed cloud to the traditional centralized solution

compared to the centralized cloud, the distributed architecture of Cubbit has a
carbon footprint reduced of a 77% factor for data storage and of a 50% factor

However, the specifications for machine learning systems currently lack precise

unrealistic assumptions about the strength of the adversary who launches them.
We propose the FAIL attacker model, which describes the adversary's knowledge
and control along four dimensions. Our model allows us to consider a wide range
of weaker adversaries who have limited control and incomplete knowledge of the
features, learning algorithms and training instances utilized. To evaluate the
utility of the FAIL model, we consider the problem of conducting targeted

clean labels, must be individually and collectively inconspicuous, and must
exhibit a generalized form of transferability, defined by the FAIL model. By
taking these constraints into account, we design StingRay, a targeted poisoning
attack that is practical against 4 machine learning applications, which use 3
different learning algorithms, and can bypass 2 existing defenses. Conversely,
we show that a prior evasion attack is less effective under generalized
transferability. Such attack evaluations, under the FAIL adversary model, may
also suggest promising directions for future defenses.

destroy the solution. We investigate the use of slope limiters for the velocity
field to overcome this problem in a way that does not compromise on the mass
conservation properties. The equations are discretised using the interior
penalty discontinuous Galerkin finite element method that is divergence free to
machine precision.
  A slope limiter made specifically for exactly divergence free (solenoidal)

convectively stable fields that are also exactly solenoidal. The lessons
learned from this are applied in constructing a simpler method based on the use
of an existing scalar slope limiter applied to each velocity component.
  We show by numerical examples how both presented slope limiting methods are
vastly superior to the naive non-limited method. The methods can solve
difficult two-phase problems with high density ratios and high Reynolds

conserves mass and stops unbounded energy growth caused by the Gibbs

$3$-hopsets and display their advantages in several practical scenarios. In

exponentially fewer shortcuts per node than any previously described distance
oracle while incurring only a quadratic increase in the query decoding time,

Clifford operator has $2^{k(k+1)/2}$ symplectic solutions. The desired physical
circuits are then obtained by decomposing each solution as a product of
elementary symplectic matrices. Our assembly of the possible physical
realizations enables optimization over them with respect to a suitable metric.
Furthermore, we show that any circuit that normalizes the stabilizer of the
code can be transformed into a circuit that centralizes the stabilizer, while
realizing the same logical operation. Our method of circuit synthesis can be
applied to any stabilizer code, and this paper provides a proof of concept
synthesis of universal Clifford gates for the $[\![ 6,4,2 ]\!]$ CSS code. We
conclude with a classical coding-theoretic perspective for constructing logical
Pauli operators for CSS codes. Since our circuit synthesis algorithm builds on
the logical Pauli operators for the code, this paper provides a complete
framework for constructing all logical Clifford operators for CSS codes.

importance in data science, molecular simulations and beyond. Several
approaches work on the assumption that the important content of a dataset
belongs to a manifold whose Intrinsic Dimension (ID) is much lower than the
crude large number of coordinates. Such manifold is generally twisted and
curved, in addition points on it will be non-uniformly distributed: two factors
that make the identification of the ID and its exploitation really hard. Here
we propose a new ID estimator using only the distance of the first and the
second nearest neighbor of each point in the sample. This extreme minimality
enables us to reduce the effects of curvature, of density variation, and the
resulting computational cost. The ID estimator is theoretically exact in
uniformly distributed datasets, and provides consistent measures in general.
When used in combination with block analysis, it allows discriminating the
relevant dimensions as a function of the block size. This allows estimating the
ID even when the data lie on a manifold perturbed by a high-dimensional noise,
a situation often encountered in real world data sets. We demonstrate the
usefulness of the approach on molecular simulations and image analysis.

the transition temperature as a function of both, the doping concentration and
the dielectric properties of the host system, in good agreement with

Computation facilities and availability of data from Galactic surveys stimulate
the appearance of models of the Galactic structure. More efforts to build
dynamical models containing both spiral arms and the central bar/bulge are
needed.
  We expand the study of the stellar dynamics in the Galaxy by adding the
bar/bulge component to a model with spiral arms introduced in our previous
paper. The model is tested by applying it to the solar neighborhood, where
observational data are more precise.
  We model analytically the potential of the Galaxy to derive the force field
in its equatorial plane. The model comprises an axisymmetric disc derived from
the observable rotation curve, four arms with Gaussian-shaped groove profiles,
and a classical elongated/oblate ellipsoidal bar/bulge structure. The
parameters describing the bar/bulge are constrained by observations and the
stellar dynamics, and their possible limits are determined.
  A basic model results in a bar of 2.9 kpc in length, with a mass of the order
of a few 10$^9M_\odot$. The size and orientation of the bar are also restricted
by the position of masers with VLBI distances. The bar's rotation speed is
constrained to $\Omega_{\rm bar}<50$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ taking into account
the allowed mass range.
  We conclude that our basic model is compatible with observations and with the
dynamical constraints. The model explains simultaneously the bulk of the main
moving groups, associated here with the spiral corotation resonance, and the
Hercules stream, associated with several inner high-order spiral resonances; in
particular, with the 8/1 resonance. From the dynamical constraints on the bar's
angular speed, it is unlikely that the bar's OLR lies near the solar circle;
moreover, its proximity would compromise the stability of the Local Arm
structure.

the interplay of charge order with superconductivity. Here the interplay of
charge order with superconductivity in cuprate superconductors is studied based
on the kinetic-energy-driven superconducting (SC) mechanism by taking into
account the intertwining between the pseudogap and SC gap. It is shown that the
appearance of the Fermi pockets is closely associated with the emergence of the
pseudogap. However, the distribution of the spectral weight of the SC-state
quasiparticle spectrum on the Fermi arc, or equivalently the front side of the
Fermi pocket, and back side of Fermi pocket is extremely anisotropic, where the
most part of the spectral weight is located around the tips of the Fermi arcs,
which in this case coincide with the hot spots on the electron Fermi surface
(EFS). In particular, as charge order in the normal-state, this EFS instability
drives charge order in the SC-state, with the charge-order wave vector that is
well consistent with the wave vector connecting the hot spots on the straight
Fermi arcs. Furthermore, this charge-order state is doping dependent, with the
charge-order wave vector that decreases in magnitude with the increase of
doping. Although there is a coexistence of charge order and superconductivity,
this charge order antagonizes superconductivity. The results from the SC-state
dynamical charge structure factor indicate the existence of a quantitative
connection between the low-energy electronic structure and collective response
of the electron density. The theory also shows that the pseudogap and charge
order have a root in common, they and superconductivity are a natural
consequence of the strong electron correlation.

of attention in the field of distributed point strain measurement. One of the
most interesting properties of these sensors is the presumed linear
relationship between the strain and the peak wavelength shift of the FBG
reflected spectra. However, subjecting sensors to a non-uniform stress field
will in general result in a strain estimation error when using this linear
relationship. In this paper we propose a new strain estimation algorithm that
accurately estimates the mean strain value in the case of smooth non-uniform
strain distributions. To do so, we first introduce an approximation of the
classical transfer matrix model, which we will refer to as the approximated
transfer matrix model (ATMM). This model facilitates the analysis of FBG
reflected spectra under arbitrary strain distributions, particularly by
providing a closed-form approximation of the side-lobes of the reflected
spectra. Based on this new formulation, we derive a maximum likelihood
estimator of the mean strain value. The algorithm is validated using both
computer simulations and experimental FBG measurements. Compared to
state-of-the-art methods, which typically introduce errors of tens of
microstrains, the proposed method is able to compensate for this error. In the
typical examples that were analysed in this study, mean strain errors of around
60 microstrains were compensated.

modes refer to stochastic independence. Standard serial models are defined by
stochastic independence and identical distributions of their processing times.
Processing times in the serial models are identical to the intercompletion time
statistics. Similarly, standard parallel models assume stochastically
independent and identical processing times. Their processing times are
equivalent to the statistic known as total completion times. Little is known
about what standard serial models can predict for the total completion time or
what standard parallel models can predict for the intercompletion times. Here
we demonstrate that standard serial models possess a tendency to predict a
positive dependence for the total completion times with that always being true
in the case of a single processing order. However, with mixtures of processing
orders, standard serial models may predict negative dependence of the total
completion times. Comparably, standard parallel models typically predict
neither independence of the intercompletion times nor identical distributions.
In fact, standard parallel models predict increasing intercompletion times as
the individual channels continue to finish. Nevertheless, dramatically
increasing hazard functions of the channels can defeat that tendency. And,
standard parallel models can predict intercompletion time independence but only
when individual channel distributions are exponential. Finally, we use these
and ancillary mathematical results to conclude that standard serial and
standard parallel models can never perfectly mimic one another. Therefore, our

modern processors employ various techniques to identify and prefetch different
memory access patterns. While most modern prefetchers target spatio-temporal
patterns by matching memory addresses that are accessed in close proximity
(either in space or time), the recently proposed concept of semantic locality
views locality as an artifact of the algorithmic level and searches for
correlations between memory accesses and program state. While this approach was
shown to be effective, capturing semantic locality requires significant
associative learning capabilities. In this paper we utilize neural networks for
this task. We leverage recent advances in machine learning to propose a neural
network prefetcher. We show that by observing program context, this prefetcher
can learn distinct memory access patterns that cannot be covered by other
state-of-the-art prefetchers. We evaluate the neural network prefetcher over
SPEC2006, Graph500, and several microbenchmarks. We show that the prefetcher
can deliver an average speedup of 30% for SPEC2006 (up to 2.7x) and up to 4.6x
over kernels. We also present a high-level design of our prefetcher, explore
the power, energy and area limitations, and propose several optimizations for
feasibility. We believe that this line of research can further improve the
efficiency of such neural networks and allow harnessing them for additional
micro-architectural predictions.

it requires huge training dataset. Researchers often meet privacy issues when
they collect image dataset especially for surveillance applications. A
learnable image encryption scheme is introduced. The key idea of this scheme is
to encrypt images, so that human cannot understand images but the network can
be train with encrypted images. This scheme allows us to train the network
without the privacy issues. In this paper, a simple learnable image encryption
algorithm is proposed. Then, the proposed algorithm is validated with cifar

  Commercial Aviation",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the growth of commercial aviation over the last few decades there have
been many applications designed to improve the efficiency of flight operations
as well as safety and security. A number of these applications are based on the
gathered data from flights; the data is usually acquired from the various
sensors available on the aircraft. There are numerous sensors among the
electrical and electronics devices on an aircraft, most of which are essential
for the proper functioning of the same. With the sensors being operational
throughout the time of movement of the aircraft, a large amount of data is
collected during each flight. Normally, most of the gathered data are stored on
a storage device on the aircraft, and are analyzed and studied later off-site
for research purposes focusing on improving airline operation and efficiently
maintaining the same. In certain cases, when there is data transfer during the
flight, it is between the aircraft and an air-traffic-control (ATC) tower,
which serves as the base station. The aircraft equipped with all these sensors,
which can gather and exchange data, form a framework of Internet of things
(IoT). Detecting and avoiding any form of turbulence for an aircraft is vital;
it adds to the safety of both passengers and aircraft while reducing the
operating cost of the airline. Therefore, in this paper, we study techniques to
detect and avoid Clear Air Turbulence (CAT), which is a specific type of
turbulence, based on the IoT framework of aircraft. We propose algorithms that
consider both direct and indirect communication between aircraft within a
specific region. Using simulation results, we show that our proposed techniques
of direct communication using the IoT framework is faster than conventional
techniques involving radio communication via both single ATC tower and multiple
ATC towers.

existing research, the present modular simulation model can take different
design structures of data centres into account and provide us with hourly power
consumption profiles for each component. The impacts of environmental
parameters such as temperature and humidity are also investigated and
incorporated into the model. The flexibility, scalability, comprehensiveness
and modularity of this model provides researchers and designers with a powerful

capabilities have enabled the collection of rich contextual information and
mobile phone usage records through the device logs. This paper formulates the
problem of mining behavioral association rules of individual mobile phone users
utilizing their smartphone data. Association rule learning is the most popular
technique to discover rules utilizing large datasets. However, it is well-known
that a large proportion of association rules generated are redundant. This
redundant production makes not only the rule-set unnecessarily large but also
makes the decision making process more complex and ineffective. In this paper,
we propose an approach that effectively identifies the redundancy in
associations and extracts a concise set of behavioral association rules that
are non-redundant. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is examined by
considering the real mobile phone datasets of individual users.

is of great importance for promoting advances in color display science. So far,
most of the work in this field has been focused on achieving static colors,
limiting many potential applications. This inevitably calls for the development
of dynamic color displays with advanced and innovative functionalities. In this
Letter, we demonstrate a novel dynamic color printing scheme using
magnesium-based pixelated Fabry-Perot cavities by grey-scale nanolithography.
With controlled hydrogenation and dehydrogenation, magnesium undergoes unique
metal and dielectric transitions, enabling distinct blank and color states from
the pixelated Fabry-Perot resonators. Following such a scheme, we first
demonstrate dynamic Ishihara plates, in which the encrypted images can only be
read out using hydrogen as information decoding key. We also demonstrate a new
type of dynamic color generation, which enables fascinating transformations
between black/white printing and color printing with fine tonal tuning. Our
work will find wide-ranging applications in full-color printing and displays,
colorimetric sensing, information encryption and anti-counterfeiting.

  Some Non-Convex Programming Problems",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we consider three minimization problems, namely quadratic,
$\rho$-convex and quadratic fractional programing problems. The quadratic
problem is considered with quadratic inequality constraints with bounded
continuous and discrete mixed variables. The $\rho$-convex problem is
considered with $\rho$-convex inequality constraints in mixed variables. The
quadratic fractional problem is studied with quadratic fractional constraints
in mixed variables. For all three problems we reformulate the problem as a
mathematical programming problem and apply standard Karush Kuhn Tucker
necessary conditions. Then, for each problem, we provide local necessary
optimality condition. Further, for each problem a Lagrangian multiplier
sufficient optimality condition is provided to identify global minimizer among
the local minimizers. For the quadratic problem underestimation of a Lagrangian
was employed to obtain the desired sufficient conditions. For the $\rho$-convex
problem we obtain two sufficient optimality conditions to distinguish a global
minimizer among the local minimizers, one with an underestimation of a
Lagrangian and the other with a different technique. A global sufficient
optimality condition for the quadratic fractional problem is obtained by
reformulating the problem as a quadratic problem and then utilizing the results
of the quadratic problem. Examples are provided to illustrate the significance
of the results obtained.

transparency of the system is pivotal which can be achieved by tracking the

have been instrumental in the historical advancement of machine learning.
However in the field of deep learning, they have been largely displaced by
rectified linear units (ReLU) or similar functions, such as its exponential
linear unit (ELU) variant, to mitigate the effects of vanishing gradients
associated with error back-propagation. The logistic sigmoid however does not
represent the true input-output relation in neuronal cells under physiological
conditions. Here, bionodal root unit (BRU) activation functions are introduced,
exhibiting input-output non-linearities that are substantially more
biologically plausible since their functional form is based on known
biophysical properties of neuronal cells.
  In order to evaluate the learning performance of BRU activations, deep
networks are constructed with identical architectures except differing in their
transfer functions (ReLU, ELU, and BRU). Multilayer perceptrons, stacked
auto-encoders, and convolutional networks are used to test supervised and
unsupervised learning based on the MNIST and CIFAR-10/100 datasets. Comparisons
of learning performance, quantified using loss and error measurements,
demonstrate that bionodal networks both train faster than their ReLU and ELU
counterparts and result in the best generalised models even in the absence of
formal regularisation. These results therefore suggest that revisiting the
detailed properties of biological neurones and their circuitry might prove
invaluable in the field of deep learning for the future.
