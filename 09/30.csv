generate a large dataset of H&E training images with perfect nuclei
segmentation labels using an unpaired GAN framework. This synthetic data along
with real histopathology data from six different organs are used to train a
conditional GAN with spectral normalization and gradient penalty for nuclei
segmentation. This adversarial regression framework enforces higher order

patients and disease states, and outperforms conventional approaches,
especially in isolating individual and overlapping nuclei.

intelligence where an agent performs learning through trial and error. It
differs from supervised learning, since reinforcement learning requires no
explicit labels; instead, the agent interacts continuously with its
environment. That is, the agent starts in a specific state and then performs an
action, based on which it transitions to a new state and, depending on the
outcome, receives a reward. Different strategies (e.g. Q-learning) have been
proposed to maximize the overall reward, resulting in a so-called policy, which
defines the best possible action in each state. Mathematically, this process
can be formalized by a Markov decision process and it has been implemented by
packages in R; however, there is currently no package available for
reinforcement learning. As a remedy, this paper demonstrates how to perform
reinforcement learning in R and, for this purpose, introduces the
ReinforcementLearning package. The package provides a remarkably flexible
framework and is easily applied to a wide range of different problems. We
demonstrate its use by drawing upon common examples from the literature (e.g.

Hugoniot equation, relating the temperature $T$ behind a shock wave to the
compression ratio $\rho/\rho_0$ across the shock front, is used in connection
with the plasma equation of state to determine the pressure $p$, effective
plasma charge $Z^\ast$ and the K-shell occupation in terms of $\rho/\rho_0$.
Solutions of the Hugoniot equation (determined within the framework of the
generalized Thomas-Fermi theory) reveal that the K-shell occupation in low-Z
ions decreases rapidly from 2 to 0.1 as the temperature increases from 20eV to
500eV; a temperature range in which the shock compression ratio is near 4. The
average-atom model (a quantum mechanical version of the generalized
Thomas-Fermi theory) is used to determine K-shell and continuum wave functions
and the photoionization cross section for x-rays in the energy range
$\omega=1$eV to 10keV, where the opacity is dominated by the atomic
photoionization process. For an uncompressed boron plasma at $T=10$eV, where
the K-shell is filled, the average-atom cross section, the atomic scattering
factor and the mass attenuation coefficient are all shown to agree closely with
previous (cold matter) tabulations. For shock-compressed plasmas, the
dependence of the $\mu/\rho$ on temperature can be approximated by scaling
previously tabulated cold-matter values by the relative K-shell occupation,
however, there is a relatively small residual dependence arising from the
photoionization cross section. Attenuation coefficients $\mu$ for a 9 keV x-ray
are given as functions of $T$ along the Hugoniot for B, C, B$_4$C and BN

steady state solution and from a linearized stability analysis formulate
criteria for which this base state can undergo either a Hopf bifurcation, a
symmetry-breaking pitchfork (or Turing) bifurcation, or a codimension-two
pitchfork-Hopf bifurcation. For each of these three types of bifurcations, a
multiple time-scale asymptotic analysis is used to derive normal form amplitude
equations characterizing the local branching behavior of spatio-temporal
patterns in the weakly nonlinear regime. Among the novel aspects of this weakly
nonlinear analysis are the two-dimensionality of the bulk domain, the
systematic treatment of arbitrary reaction kinetics restricted to the boundary,
the bifurcation parameters which arise in the boundary conditions, and the
underlying spectral problem where both the differential operator and the
boundary conditions involve the eigenvalue parameter. The normal form theory is
illustrated for both Schnakenberg and Brusselator reaction kinetics, and the
weakly nonlinear results are favorably compared with numerical bifurcation
results and results from time-dependent PDE simulations of the coupled

subcritical or supercritical Hopf and symmetry-breaking bifurcations, and
mixed-mode oscillations characteristic of codimension-two bifurcations.

presented. It is based on methodology that was introduced by Bijani et al
(2015), in which a homogeneous subsurface body is modeled by an ensemble of
simple point masses. The model parameters are the Cartesian coordinates of the
point masses and their total mass. Associating the point masses to the vertices
of a weighted full graph with weights computed by the Euclidean pairwise
distances separating vertices, Kruskal's algorithm is used to find the minimum
spanning tree of the graph. Stabilization is achieved using an equidistance
function that restricts the spatial distribution of the masses and favors a
homogeneous subsurface structure. A regularization parameter $\lambda$ is
introduced to balance the two terms of the objective function, and reasonable
physically-relevant bound constraints are imposed on the model parameters. Then
the bound constrained objective function is solved using a genetic algorithm. A
new diagnostic approach is presented for determining a suitable choice for
$\lambda$, requiring a limited number of solutions for a small set of $\lambda$
without using the L-curve as suggested by Bijani et al. Simulations for
synthetic examples demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the
implementation of the algorithm. It is verified that the constraints on the
model parameters are not restrictive. Included in the package is the script
GMD.m which is used for generating synthetic data and for putting measurement
data in the format required for the inversion implemented by IGUG.m The script
Diagnostic_Results.m is included for analyzing and visualizing the results. The
software can be used to verify the simulations and the analysis of real data

distinct resonant scattering peaks in the gate-dependent resistance, which
evolve as a function of atomic hydrogen dosage. Theoretical calculations show
that one of the peaks originates from resonant scattering by hydrogen adatoms

hydrogen adatoms on the \b{eta}-sublattice (non-dimer site), thereby enabling a
method for characterizing the relative sublattice occupancy via transport
measurements. Utilizing this new capability, we investigate the adsorption and
thermal desorption of hydrogen adatoms via controlled annealing and conclude
that hydrogen adsorption on the \b{eta}-sublattice is energetically favored.
Through site-selective desorption from the {\alpha}-sublattice, we realize
hydrogen doping with adatoms primarily on a single sublattice, which is highly
desired for generating ferromagnetism.

chaotic many-body ratchet in the mean-field limit. Specifically, we explore a
driven Bose-Einstein condensate in three distinct dynamical regimes - Rabi
oscillations, chaos, and self-trapping regime, and for each of them we
calculate the correlation dimension. For the ground state of the ratchet formed
by a system of field-free non-interacting particles, we find four distinct
pockets of chaotic dynamics throughout these regimes. We show that a
measurement of a local density in each of the dynamical regimes, has an
attractor characterized with a higher fractal dimension, $D_{R}=2.59\pm0.01$,
$D_{C}=3.93\pm0.04$, and $D_{S}=3.05\pm0.05$, as compared to the global measure
of current, $D_{R}=2.07\pm0.02$, $D_{C}=2.96\pm0.05$, and $D_{S}=2.30\pm0.02$.
We find that the many-body case converges to mean-field limit with strong
sub-unity power laws in particle number $N$, namely $N^{\alpha}$ with
$\alpha_{R}={0.28\pm0.01}$, $\alpha_{C}={0.34\pm0.067}$ and
$\alpha_{S}={0.90\pm0.24}$ for each of the dynamical regimes mentioned above.
The deviation between local and global measurement of the attractor's dimension
corresponds to an increase towards high condensate depletion which remains
constant for long time scales in both Rabi and chaotic regimes. The depletion
is found to scale polynomially with particle number as $N^{\beta}$ with
$\beta_{R}={0.51\pm0.004}$ and $\beta_{C}={0.18\pm0.004}$ for the two regimes.
Thus, we find a strong deviation from the mean-field results, especially in the
chaotic regime of the quantum ratchet. The ratchet also reveals quantum
revivals in the Rabi and self-trapped regimes but not in the chaotic regime.
Based on the obtained results we outline pathways for the identification and
characterization of the emergent phenomena in driven many-body systems.

are determined using observations of the J=(3-2), (4-3), (5-4), (10-9),
(18-17), (19-18), (21-20), and (24-23) transitions of the molecule HC3N. We
find evidence of at least two excitation regimes for HC3N and constrain the
low-excitation component to have a density less than 10^4 cm^-3 and the
high-excitation component to have a density between 10^5 and 10^6 cm^-3. This
is much less than densities of 10^7 cm^-3 that are found in Sgr B2, the most
actively star-forming cloud in the Galactic center. This is consistent with the
requirement of a higher density threshold for star formation in the Galactic
center than is typical in the Galactic disk. We are also able to constrain the
column density of each component in order to determine the mass fraction of
'dense' (n>10^5 cm^-3) gas for these clouds. We find that this is ~15% for all
three clouds. Applying the results of our models to ratios of the (10-9) and
(3-2) line across the entire central R=300 pc, we find that the fraction of gas
with n>10^4 cm^-3 increases inward of a radius of ~140 pc, consistent with the
predictions of recent models for the gas dynamics in this region. Our
observations show that HC3N is an excellent molecule for probing the density
structure of clouds in the Galactic center.

based process that enhances hearing, termed cochlear amplification. The cell
possesses a unique motor protein, prestin, which senses voltage and
consequently changes conformation to cause large cell length changes, termed
electromotility (eM). In OHCs studied in vitro, the prestin voltage sensor
generates a capacitance that is both voltage and frequency dependent, peaking
in magnitude at a characteristic membrane voltage (Vh), which can be greater
than the linear capacitance of the cell. Consequently, the OHC membrane time
constant is multifarious depending upon resting potential and frequency of AC
evaluation. After precisely correcting for this influence on the whole-cell
voltage clamp time constant, we find that OHC eM is low pass in nature,
substantially attenuating in magnitude within the frequency bandwidth of human
speech. The frequency response is slowest at Vh, with a cut-off near 1.5 kHz,
but increases up to six-fold in a U shaped manner as holding voltage deviates
from Vh. NLC measures follow this pattern. Viscous drag alone cannot account
for such eM behavior; nor can it arise from viscous drag in combination with a
sigmoidal voltage-dependent OHC stiffness. However, viscous drag combined with
kinetics of prestin, likely corresponding to its bell-shaped conformational
gating compliance (Iwasa, 2000), is in line with our observations. How OHC eM
influences cochlear amplification at higher frequencies needs reconsideration.

a quasi-indirect band gap that arises due to Rashba splitting in both

effective relativistic band structure of (CH3NH3)PbI3 with the focus on the
dispersion of electronic states near the band edges of (CH3NH3)PbI3 affected by
thermal structural fluctuations. We establish a relation between the magnitude
of Rashba splitting and a deviation of Pb-atom from its centrosymmetric site
position in the PbI6 octahedron. For the splitting energy to reach the thermal
energy kT~26 meV (room temperature), the displacement should be of the order
0.3 Ang, which is far above the static displacements of Pb-atoms in the
tetragonal phase of (CH3NH3)PbI3. The significant dynamic enhancement of the
Rashba splitting observed at earlier simulation times (less than 2 ps) later
weakens and becomes less than the thermal energy despite the average
displacement of Pb-atoms remaining large (0.37 Ang). It is randomization of
Pb-displacement vectors and associated cancelation of the net effective
magnetic field acting on electrons at the conduction band edge is responsible
for reduction of the Rashba splitting. The lattice dynamics also leads to
deterioration of Bloch character for states in the valence band leading to
subsequent localization of holes, which affects bipolar mobility of charge
carriers in (CH3NH3)PbI3. These results call into question the quasi-indirect
band gap as a reason for the long carrier lifetime observed in (CH3NH3)PbI3 at

molecular environments, in particular for electrostatic fields and polarizable
(reactive) sites of molecules. Fictitious nuclear masses are chosen in order to
yield a rigid dipole with appropriate magnitude. Upon subtracting the
Born-Oppenheimer energy, the interaction is reduced to the Field-dipole-like
and the dipole-polarizability-like terms, the last one being particularly
informative since connected to potentially reactive sites. The Field strength
and orientation are easily obtained by identifying the minimum Field-dipole
energy configuration and flipping the dipole from it. In this case the method
appears to have a superior accuracy in comparison with ab initio approaches. In
tests with hydrogen, water, benzene and chlorobenzene molecules and with a
frustrated Lewis pair, the potential of the method is assessed.

unconstrained optimization, but its behavior on nonsmooth problems has received
little attention. L-BFGS can be used with or without ""scaling""; the use of
scaling is normally recommended. A simple special case, when just one BFGS
update is stored and used at every iteration, is sometimes also known as
memoryless BFGS. We analyze memoryless BFGS with scaling, using any
Armijo-Wolfe line search, on the function $f(x) = a|x^{(1)}| + \sum_{i=2}^{n}
x^{(i)}$, initiated at any point $x_0$ with $x_0^{(1)}\not = 0$. We show that
if $a\ge 2\sqrt{n-1}$, the absolute value of the normalized search direction
generated by this method converges to a constant vector, and if, in addition,
$a$ is larger than a quantity that depends on the Armijo parameter, then the
iterates converge to a non-optimal point $\bar x$ with $\bar x^{(1)}=0$,

method with any Armijo-Wolfe line search also fails on the same function if
$a\geq \sqrt{n-1}$ and $a$ is larger than another quantity depending on the
Armijo parameter, but scaled memoryless BFGS fails under a weaker condition
relating $a$ to the Armijo parameter than that implying failure of the gradient

standard Armijo-Wolfe bracketing line search is used, scaled memoryless BFGS
fails when $a\ge 2 \sqrt{n-1} $ regardless of the Armijo parameter. Finally,
numerical experiments indicate that similar results hold for scaled L-BFGS with

$\langle\sigma v\rangle \propto T^4$ in Kim-Shifman-Vainstein-Zakharov (KSVZ)

the necessary and sufficient condition of the convergence for the diffusion RLS

information problems involves determining the minimum rate of the common input
to two independent processors needed to exactly or approximately generate a
target joint distribution. For the exact common information problem, exact
generation of the target distribution is required, while for Wyner's and
$\alpha$-R\'enyi common informations, the relative entropy and R\'enyi
divergence with order $\alpha$ were respectively used to quantify the
discrepancy between the synthesized and target distributions. The exact common
information is larger than or equal to Wyner's common information. However, it
was hitherto unknown whether the former is strictly larger than the latter for
some joint distributions. In this paper, we first establish the equivalence
between the exact and $\infty$-R\'enyi common informations, and then provide
single-letter upper and lower bounds for these two quantities. For doubly
symmetric binary sources, we show that the upper and lower bounds coincide,
which implies that for such sources, the exact and $\infty$-R\'enyi common

such sources, these two common informations are strictly larger than Wyner's.
This answers an open problem posed by KLE. Furthermore, we extend Wyner's,
$\infty$-R\'enyi, and exact common informations to sources with countably
infinite or continuous alphabets, including Gaussian sources.

We address this problem by considering the nonanticipative RDF (NRDF) which is
a lower bound to the causal optimal performance theoretically attainable (OPTA)
function and operational zero-delay RDF. We recall the realization that
corresponds to the optimal ""test-channel"" of the Gaussian NRDF, when
considering a vector Gauss-Markov source subject to a MSE distortion in the

of solution for this problem in the infinite time horizon. For the asymptotic
regime, we use the asymptotic characterization of the Gaussian NRDF to provide
a new equivalent realization scheme with feedback which is characterized by a
resource allocation (reverse-waterfilling) problem across the dimension of the
vector source. We leverage the new realization to derive a predictive coding
scheme via lattice quantization with subtractive dither and joint memoryless
entropy coding. This coding scheme offers an upper bound to the operational
zero-delay vector-valued Gaussian RDF. When we use scalar quantization, then
for ""r"" active dimensions of the vector Gauss-Markov source the gap between the

our paper presents novel methods and ideas to design automatic posture

supervised methods to learn and recognize human postures using the main types
of visual data provided by an RGB-D camera. The first method is based on
convolutional features extracted from 2D images. Convolutional Neural Networks

joint configuration in the 3D space. Posture recognition is then performed
through SVM classification of 3D skeleton-based features. To evaluate the
proposed methods, we created a challenging posture recognition dataset with a
considerable variability regarding the acquisition conditions. The experimental
results demonstrated comparable performances and high precision for both
methods in recognizing human postures, with a slight superiority for the
CNN-based method when applied on depth images. Moreover, the two approaches
demonstrated a high robustness to several perturbation factors, such as scale

for match confidence. However, this can fail to represent uncertainty arising
when the input is ambiguous, e.g., due to occlusion or blurriness. This work
addresses this issue and explicitly models the uncertainty by hedging the
location of each input in the embedding space. We introduce the hedged instance
embedding (HIB) in which embeddings are modeled as random variables and the
model is trained under the variational information bottleneck principle.
Empirical results on our new N-digit MNIST dataset show that our method leads
to the desired behavior of hedging its bets across the embedding space upon
encountering ambiguous inputs. This results in improved performance for image
matching and classification tasks, more structure in the learned embedding
space, and an ability to compute a per-exemplar uncertainty measure that is

Motivated by research and theory showing that longitudinal wave sound speed
carries similar diagnostic abilities to shear wave imaging, we present an
alternative approach using single sided pressure-wave sound speed measurements
from channel data.
  Methods: In this paper, we present a single-sided sound speed inversion
solution using a fully convolutional deep neural network. We use simulations
for training, allowing the generation of limitless ground truth data.
  Results: We show that it is possible to invert for longitudinal sound speed
in soft tissue at high frame rates. We validate the method on simulated data.

parameter regions not studied before for spin chains or ladders. Within the
enlarged parameter space, we find the ground state wave function can be
obtained exactly along a line and at a special point, for these two phases
respectively. These exact solutions provide a clear physical picture for the
SPT phases and their edge excitations. We further obtain the phase diagram by
using infinite time-evolving block decimation, and discuss the phase
transitions between the two SPT phases and their experimental signatures.

distinct features in gravitational-wave (GW) spectrograms, including a ramp-up
signature due to the g-mode oscillation of the proto-neutron star (PNS) and an
excess in the low-frequency domain (100-300 Hz) potentially induced by the
standing accretion shock instability (SASI). These predictions motivated us to
perform a sophisticated time-frequency analysis (TFA) of the GW signals, aimed
at preparation for future observations. By reanalyzing a gravitational waveform
obtained in a three-dimensional general-relativistic CCSN simulation, we show
that both the spectrogram with an adequate window and the quadratic TFA
separate the multimodal GW signatures much more clearly compared with the
previous analysis. We find that the observed low-frequency excess during the
SASI active phase is divided into two components, a stronger one at 130 Hz and
an overtone at 260 Hz, both of which evolve quasi-statically during the
simulation time. We also identify a new mode whose frequency varies from 700 to
600 Hz. Furthermore, we develop the quadratic TFA for the Stokes I, Q, U, and V
parameters as a new tool to investigate the GW circular polarization. We
demonstrate that the polarization states that randomly change with time after
bounce are associated with the PNS g-mode oscillation, whereas a slowly
changing polarization state in the low-frequency domain is connected to the PNS
core oscillation. This study demonstrates the capability of the sophisticated
TFA for diagnosing the polarized CCSN GWs in order to explore their complex
nature.

mafic mineral of this region was acquired by analyzing these parameters. The
basaltic units in eastern Mare Frigoris, which are older, have been found to be
dominated by clinopyroxene with lower CaO compared to the returned lunar
samples; this is similar to older basaltic units in Mare Imbrium. The basaltic
units of western Mare Frigoris and Sinus Roris which are younger have been

crowds, e.g., shopping malls, canteens, train stations, or airport terminals.
In these challenging environments, existing approaches suffer from two common
problems: the robot may get frozen and cannot make any progress toward its
goal, or it may get lost due to severe occlusions inside a crowd. Here we
propose a navigation framework that handles the robot freezing and the
navigation lost problems simultaneously. First, we enhance the robot's mobility
and unfreeze the robot in the crowd using a reinforcement learning based local
navigation policy developed in our previous work~\cite{long2017towards}, which
naturally takes into account the coordination between the robot and the human.
Secondly, the robot takes advantage of its excellent local mobility to recover
from its localization failure. In particular, it dynamically chooses to
approach a set of recovery positions with rich features. To the best of our
knowledge, our method is the first approach that simultaneously solves the
freezing problem and the navigation lost problem in dense crowds. We evaluate
our method in both simulated and real-world environments and demonstrate that
it outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. Videos are available at

semi-definite programs with infinitely many convex inequality constraints,
called SISDP for short. A straightforward approach to the SISDP is to use
classical methods for semi-infinite programs such as discretization and
exchange methods and solve a sequence of (nonlinear) semi-definite programs
(SDPs). However, it is often too demanding to find exact solutions of SDPs.
  Our first approach does not rely on solving SDPs but on approximately
following {a path leading to a solution, which is formed on the intersection of
the semi-infinite region and the interior of the semi-definite region. We show
weak* convergence of this method to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point of the SISDP
under some mild assumptions and further provide with sufficient conditions for
strong convergence. Moreover, as the second method, to achieve fast local
convergence, we integrate a two-step sequential quadratic programming method
equipped with Monteiro-Zhang scaling technique into the first method. We
particularly prove two-step superlinear convergence of the second method using
Alizadeh-Hareberly-Overton-like, Nesterov-Todd, and
Helmberg-Rendle-Vanderbei-Wolkowicz/Kojima-Shindoh-Hara/Monteiro scaling

efficiency of the proposed method through comparison with a discretization
method that solves SDPs obtained by finite relaxation of the SISDP.

that AMC violations result from implementation of the degenerated viscous terms

in accordance with their stress origins. As observed in particle-based
hydrodynamics methods, the violation causes artificial rotations in
multi-component fluids with different viscosities. At the interface between two
fluids or with a mobile solid object, AMC must be satisfied, whereas AMC can be
neglected in bulk fluids. We also clarify that the condition for constant fluid
rotation as a rigid body in a container rotating at a constant speed is not the
AMC of the stresses, but the invariance of the viscous forces under a global
rotation. To confirm our theory, we simulated the circular laminar flows of
single- and binary-component fluids using two-dimensional Lagrangian finite
volume methods. The results show excellent agreement with the analytical
predictions for fluids with and without AMC.

infrastructure into independent logical networks. By this approach, each
network slice aims to accommodate the demands of increasingly diverse services.
However, precise allocation of resources to slices across future 5G
millimetre-wave backhaul networks, to optimise the total network utility, is
challenging. This is because the performance of different services often
depends on conflicting requirements, including bandwidth, sensitivity to delay,
or the monetary value of the traffic incurred. In this paper, we put forward a
general rate utility framework for slicing mm-wave backhaul links, encompassing
all known types of service utilities, i.e. logarithmic, sigmoid, polynomial,
and linear. We then introduce DELMU, a deep learning solution that tackles the
complexity of optimising non-convex objective functions built upon arbitrary
combinations of such utilities. Specifically, by employing a stack of
convolutional blocks, DELMU can learn correlations between traffic demands and
achievable optimal rate assignments. We further regulate the inferences made by
the neural network through a simple 'sanity check' routine, which guarantees
both flow rate admissibility within the network's capacity region and minimum
service levels. The proposed method can be trained within minutes, following
which it computes rate allocations that match those obtained with
state-of-the-art global optimisation algorithms, yet orders of magnitude
faster. This confirms the applicability of DELMU to highly dynamic traffic
regimes and we demonstrate up to 62% network utility gains over a baseline
greedy approach.

images are represented as a sparse linear combination of prototype atoms via
Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm. Sparse codes are then used to train an
SVM classifier dedicated to the recognition task. The dictionary that
sparsifies the facial images (feature points with the same class labels should

sparsifying dictionaries heavily relies on the initialization process of the
dictionary. To improve the performance of dictionaries, a random face feature

accreting SMBHs in the local universe, the feedback capability of their black
hole activity is elusive. We present spatially-resolved H$\alpha$ measurements
to trace ongoing star formation in Seyfert galaxies and compare their specific
star formation rate with a sample of star-forming galaxies whose global galaxy
properties are controlled to be the same as the Seyferts. From the comparison
we find that the star formation rates within central kpc of Seyfert galaxies

that a GAN can effectively train even a small feed-forward fully connected

optimization under the framework of local privacy, which is called
Privacy-pREserving StochasTIc Gradual lEarning (PRESTIGE). PRESTIGE bridges
private updates of the primal variable (by private sampling) with the gradual
curriculum learning (CL). Specifically, the noise injection leads to the issue
of label noise, but the robust learning process of CL can combat with label
noise. Thus, PRESTIGE yields ""private but robust"" updates of the primal
variable on the private curriculum, namely an reordered label sequence provided
by CL. In theory, we reveal the convergence rate and maximum complexity of
PRESTIGE. Empirical results on six datasets show that, PRESTIGE achieves a good
tradeoff between privacy preservation and robustness over baselines.

updating rules. Previous studies usually focus on imitation-based rules, which
rely on payoff information of social peers. Recent behavioral experiments
suggest that whether individuals use such social information for strategy
updating may be crucial to the outcomes of social interactions. This hints at
the importance of considering updating rules without dependence on social
peers' payoff information, which, however, is rarely investigated. Here, we
study aspiration-based self-evaluation rules, with which individuals
self-assess the performance of strategies by comparing own payoffs with an
imaginary value they aspire, called the aspiration level. We explore the fate
of strategies on population structures represented by graphs or networks. Under
weak selection, we analytically derive the condition for strategy dominance,
which is found to coincide with the classical condition of risk-dominance. This
condition holds for all networks and all distributions of aspiration levels,
and for individualized ways of self-evaluation. Our condition can be
intuitively interpreted: one strategy prevails over the other if the strategy
brings more satisfaction to individuals than the other does. Our work thus
sheds light on the intrinsic difference between evolutionary dynamics induced
by aspiration-based and imitation-based rules.

velocity exceeds a certain threshold, the soliton passes through the coherent

demonstrated that the soliton is not destroyed, but its velocity inside the

giving the mass spectrum analysis and the strong decay calculation, and predict
the existence of $1P$ and $2S$ partners of the $\Sigma_b(6097)$, where their
masses and the corresponding decay behaviors are presented. Because of the
success of describing the $\Sigma_b(6097)$ and the former observed
$\Xi_b(6227)$ under the quasi-two-body treatment to the bottom baryons, we
continue to predict the $\Omega_b$ partners of $\Sigma_b(6097)$ by the same

Identifying these predicted bottom baryons will be a research topic full of

completely accurate, and fluctuation always appears in noise channel. It is
found that when fluctuation of physical noise channel is considered, the
average effective channel is dependent only on the average of physical noise
channel, and the average of physical noise channel here plays the role of the
independent error model in the previous works. Now, one may conclude that in
the independent error model, the results in previous works are also valid for
average channel where fluctuation exists. In some typical cases, our numerical
simulations in the concatenated QEC protocol with 5-qubit code, 7-qubit Steane
code and 9-qubit Shor confirm this conjecture. For 5-qubit code, the effective
channels are approximate to depolarizing channel as the concatenated level
increases. For Steane code, the effective channels are approximate to one Pauli
channel as the concatenated level increases. For Shor code, the effective
channels are approximate to one of Pauli-$X$ and Pauli-$Z$ channels in each
level, and in next concatenated level, the effective channels are approximate
to the other. Meanwhile, for these codes, the numerical results indicate that
the degree of approximation increases with the concatenated level increases,
and the fluctuation of noise channel decays exponentially as concatenated QEC
performed. On the error-correction threshold, attenuation ratio of standard
deviation of channel fidelity roughly has a stable value. On the other hand,
standard deviations of off-diagonal elements of quantum process matrix (Pauli
Form) decay more quickly than standard deviations of diagonal elements.

fermions interact with the Standard Model via dimension-six operators of either
scalar-pseudoscalar, vector-axial vector, or tensor-axial tensor type, we
obtain bounds on the effective cut-off scale $\Lambda$ from supernova cooling
and free-streaming of DM from supernova core, and from thermal relic density
considerations, depending on the DM mass and the $q$-deformation parameter.
Using Raffelt's criterion on the energy loss rate from SN1987A, we obtain a
lower bound on $\Lda \gtrsim 3$ (12) TeV corresponding to $q = 1.0~(1.1)$ and
an average supernova core temperature of $T_{\rm SN}=30$ MeV. From the optical
depth criterion on the free-streaming of DM fermions from the outer 10\% of the
SN1987A core, the cooling bound is restricted to $\Lda \gtrsim 1$ TeV. Both
cooling and free-streaming bounds are insensitive to the DM mass $m_\chi$ for
$m_\chi\lesssim T_{\rm SN}$, whereas for $m_\chi\gg T_{\rm SN}$, the bounds
weaken significantly due to the Boltzmann-suppression of the DM number density.
We also calculate the thermal relic density of the DM particles in this setup

with the cooling/free-streaming bound significantly constrains light
leptophilic DM.

and flows in the solar interior from observations of solar oscillations at the
surface. Holograms contain noise due to the stochastic nature of solar
oscillations. We provide a theoretical framework for modeling signal and noise
in Porter-Bojarski helioseismic holography. The wave equation may be recast
into a Helmholtz-like equation, so as to connect with the acoustics literature
and define the holography Green's function in a meaningful way. Sources of wave
excitation are assumed to be stationary, horizontally homogeneous, and
spatially uncorrelated. Using the first Born approximation we calculate
holograms in the presence of perturbations in sound-speed, density, flows, and
source covariance, as well as the noise level as a function of position. This
work is a direct extension of the methods used in time-distance helioseismology
to model signal and noise. To illustrate the theory, we compute the hologram
intensity numerically for a buried sound-speed perturbation at different depths
in the solar interior. The reference Green's function is obtained for a
spherically-symmetric solar model using a finite-element solver in the
frequency domain. Below the pupil area on the surface, we find that the spatial
resolution of the hologram intensity is very close to half the local
wavelength. For a sound-speed perturbation of size comparable to the local
spatial resolution, the signal-to-noise ratio is approximately constant with
depth. Averaging the hologram intensity over a number $N$ of frequencies above
3 mHz increases the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor nearly equal to the
square root of $N$. This may not be the case at lower frequencies, where large
variations in the holographic signal are due to the individual contributions of
the long-lived modes of oscillation.

the extended RAR model to other structures from dwarfs to ellipticals to galaxy
clusters, pointing out the relevant case of $mc^2 = 48$ keV. By making a full
coverage of the remaining free parameters of the theory, and for each galactic
structure, we present a complete family of astrophysical RAR profiles which
satisfy realistic halo boundary conditions inferred from observations. Each
family-set of RAR solutions predicts given windows of total halo masses and
central quantum-core masses, the latter opening the interesting possibility to
interpret them as alternatives either to intermediate-mass BHs (for dwarf
galaxies), or to supermassive BHs (SMBHs, in the case of larger galaxy types).
The model is shown to be in good agreement with different observationally
inferred scaling relations such as: (1) the Ferrarese relation connecting DM
halos with supermassive dark central objects; and (2) the nearly constant DM
surface density of galaxies. Finally, the theory provides a natural mechanism

relatively small heliocentric distance (0.1 - 0.3 AU). Once at the perihelion,
the sails are deployed. Besides electromagnetic propulsion due to the solar
radiation, another mechanism could be convenient: thermal desorption, a
physical process of mass loss which can provide additional thrust as heating
liberates atoms, embedded on the surface of a solar sail. Therefore, the sails

the nonparametric instrumental variable approach. In a Monte Carlo study, we
analyze the finite sample properties of our estimator and we compare our

unconditional moment estimation. In the empirical application, we focus on two
different applications. We estimate the association between income and health

selected to classify a given test sample. This is achieved by defining a
criterion to measure the level of competence of a base classifier, such as, its
accuracy in local regions of the feature space around the query instance.
However, using only one criterion about the behavior of a base classifier is
not sufficient to accurately estimate its level of competence. In this paper,
we present a novel dynamic ensemble selection framework using meta-learning. We
propose five distinct sets of meta-features, each one corresponding to a
different criterion to measure the level of competence of a classifier for the
classification of input samples. The meta-features are extracted from the
training data and used to train a meta-classifier to predict whether or not a
base classifier is competent enough to classify an input instance. During the
generalization phase, the meta-features are extracted from the query instance
and passed down as input to the meta-classifier. The meta-classifier estimates,
whether a base classifier is competent enough to be added to the ensemble.
Experiments are conducted over several small sample size classification
problems, i.e., problems with a high degree of uncertainty due to the lack of
training data. Experimental results show the proposed meta-learning framework
greatly improves classification accuracy when compared against current
