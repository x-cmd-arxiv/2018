Oja's method, GROUSE and PETRELS, for subspace estimation from streaming and
highly incomplete observations. We show that, with proper time scaling, the
time-varying principal angles between the true subspace and its estimates given
by the algorithms converge weakly to deterministic processes when the ambient
dimension $n$ tends to infinity. Moreover, the limiting processes can be
exactly characterized as the unique solutions of certain ordinary differential
equations (ODEs). A finite sample bound is also given, showing that the rate of
convergence towards such limits is $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n})$. In addition to
providing asymptotically exact predictions of the dynamic performance of the
algorithms, our high-dimensional analysis yields several insights, including an
asymptotic equivalence between Oja's method and GROUSE, and a precise scaling
relationship linking the amount of missing data to the signal-to-noise ratio.
By analyzing the solutions of the limiting ODEs, we also establish phase
transition phenomena associated with the steady-state performance of these
techniques.

  meta-analysis","24 pages, 3 figures",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Network Meta-Analysis (NMA) is a key component of submissions to
reimbursement agencies world-wide, especially when there is limited direct
head-to-head evidence for multiple technologies from randomised controlled
trials (RCTs). Many NMAs include only data from RCTs. However, real-world
evidence (RWE) is also becoming widely recognised as a valuable source of
clinical data. We investigate methods for the inclusion of RWE in NMA and its
impact on the uncertainty around the effectiveness estimates.
  Methods: A range of methods for inclusion of RWE in evidence synthesis,
including Bayesian hierarchical and power prior models, were investigated by
applying them to an example in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. The
effect of the inclusion of RWE was investigated by varying the degree of down
weighting of this part of evidence by the use of a power prior.
  Results: Whilst the inclusion of the RWE led to an increase in the level of
uncertainty surrounding effect estimates in this example, this depended on the
method of inclusion adopted for the RWE. Power prior NMA model resulted in
stable effect estimates for fingolimod yet increasing the width of the credible
intervals with increasing weight given to RWE data. The hierarchical NMA models
were effective in allowing for heterogeneity between study designs; however,
this also increased the level of uncertainty.
  Conclusion: The power prior approach for the inclusion of RWE in NMAs
indicates that the degree to which RWE is taken into account can have a
significant impact on the overall level of uncertainty. The hierarchical
modelling approach further allowed for accommodating differences between study
types. Consequently, further work investigating both empirical evidence for
biases associated with individual RWE studies and methods of elicitation from
experts on the extent of such biases is warranted.

We found that observations could only be reproduced by models assuming either a

We further tested the models by calculating their M/L ratios. We conclude that
a constant, time-independent bottom-heavy IMF does not reproduce the data,
especially the increase of the $[\alpha/Fe]$ ratio with galactic stellar mass,
whereas a variable IMF, switching from top to bottom-heavy, can match
observations. For the latter models, the IMF switch always occurs at the

that both $N(1875)$ and $N(2080)$ can be ascribed as the hadronic molecular

convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to handle global deformations of images,
which is critical to success in many vision tasks. This paper proposes to
decompose the convolutional filters over joint steerable bases across the space
and the group geometry simultaneously, namely a rotation-equivariant CNN with
decomposed convolutional filters (RotDCF). This decomposition facilitates
computing the joint convolution, which is proved to be necessary for the group
equivariance. It significantly reduces the model size and computational
complexity while preserving performance, and truncation of the bases expansion
serves implicitly to regularize the filters. On datasets involving in-plane and
out-of-plane object rotations, RotDCF deep features demonstrate greater
robustness and interpretability than regular CNNs. The stability of the
equivariant representation to input variations is also proved theoretically
under generic assumptions on the filters in the decomposed form. The RotDCF
framework can be extended to groups other than rotations, providing a general
approach which achieves both group equivariance and representation stability at
a reduced model size.

a more robust and accurate determination of $H_0$. Moreover, that kind of

investigated if the sample of galaxy clusters used by LC has a relevant role in
their results, then (ii) we perform a more accurate and competitive
determination of $H_0$ in intermediate redshifts, free of unknown systematic

spectral and timing properties of the source correspond to that of an (hard)

amplitude of the low frequency ($<0.3$ Hz) band-limited noise shows a dramatic
turnover as a function of energy: it peaks at 0.5 keV with nearly 5\% rms,
drops to $12\%$ rms at 2 keV, and rises to $15\%$ rms at 10 keV. Through the
analysis of covariance spectra, we demonstrate that band-limited noise exists
in both the soft thermal emission and the power-law emission. Additionally, we
measure hard time lags, indicating the thermal emission at $0.5$ keV leads the
power-law emission at 10 keV on a timescale of $\sim100$ ms at $0.3$ Hz to
$\sim10$ ms at $3$ Hz. Our results demonstrate that the thermal emission in the

  and related problems",,,,,"econ.EM stat.CO stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes computationally efficient methods that can be used for
instrumental variable quantile regressions (IVQR) and related methods with
statistical guarantees. This is much needed when we investigate heterogenous
treatment effects since interactions between the endogenous treatment and
control variables lead to an increased number of endogenous covariates. We
prove that the GMM formulation of IVQR is NP-hard and finding an approximate
solution is also NP-hard. Hence, solving the problem from a purely
computational perspective seems unlikely. Instead, we aim to obtain an estimate
that has good statistical properties and is not necessarily the global solution
of any optimization problem.
  The proposal consists of employing $k$-step correction on an initial
estimate. The initial estimate exploits the latest advances in mixed integer
linear programming and can be computed within seconds. One theoretical
contribution is that such initial estimators and Jacobian of the moment
condition used in the k-step correction need not be even consistent and merely
$k=4\log n$ fast iterations are needed to obtain an efficient estimator. The
overall proposal scales well to handle extremely large sample sizes because
lack of consistency requirement allows one to use a very small subsample to
obtain the initial estimate and the k-step iterations on the full sample can be
implemented efficiently. Another contribution that is of independent interest
is to propose a tuning-free estimation for the Jacobian matrix, whose
definition nvolves conditional densities. This Jacobian estimator generalizes
bootstrap quantile standard errors and can be efficiently computed via
closed-end solutions. We evaluate the performance of the proposal in
simulations and an empirical example on the heterogeneous treatment effect of
Job Training Partnership Act.

full design, with noise and deformations. The goal of this paper is to address
the challenging problem of automatically identifying the underlying full design
of curve patterns from such a sherd. Specifically, we formulate this problem as
template matching: curve structure segmented from the sherd is matched to each
location with each possible orientation of each known full design. In this
paper, we propose a new two-stage matching algorithm, with a different matching
cost in each stage. In Stage 1, we use a traditional template matching, which
is highly computationally efficient, over the whole search space and identify a
small set of candidate matchings. In Stage 2, we derive a new matching cost by
training a dual-source Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and apply it to
re-rank the candidate matchings identified in Stage 1. We collect 600 pottery
sherds with 98 full designs from the Woodland Period in Southeastern North
America for experiments and the performance of the proposed algorithm is very
competitive.

sequence of stages, where both the sequence of stages and stage sizes are

half filling, the fermiology consists of well nested Fermi pockets derived from
opposite valleys, leading to enhanced valley fluctuation, which in turn can
mediate superconductivity. This scenario is studied within the random phase
approximation. We find that inter-valley electron pairing with either chiral
($d+i d$ mixed with $p-i p$) or helical form factor is the dominant
instability. An approximate SO(4) spin-valley symmetry implies a near
degeneracy of spin-singlet and triplet pairing. On increasing interactions,
commensurate inter-valley coherence wave (IVCW) order can arise, with
simultaneous condensation at the three M points in the Brillouin Zone, and a
$2\times2$ pattern in real space. In simple treatments though, this leads to a
full gap at fillings $\pm (1/2+1/8)$, slightly away from half-filling. An SO(4)
symmetry breaking ""anti-Hunds"" coupling favors the spin-singlet order both for
the IVCW and the superconductor, consistent with observations. Mott insulators
derived from phase fluctuating superconductors are also discussed, which
exhibit both symmetry protected and intrinsic topological orders.

$\Pi$ into another communication protocol $\Pi'$ such that, even if errors are
introduced during the execution of $\Pi'$, the parties are able to determine
what the outcome of running $\Pi$ would be in a noise-free setting.
  We consider the problem of designing interactive coding schemes which allow
the parties to simulate the original protocol using little memory.
Specifically, given any communication protocol $\Pi$ we construct robust
simulating protocols which tolerate a constant noise rate and require the
parties to use only $O(\log d \log s)$ memory, where $d$ is the depth of $\Pi$
and $s$ is a measure of the size of $\Pi$. Prior to this work, all known coding
schemes required the parties to use at least $\Omega(d)$ memory, as the parties
were required to remember the transcript of the conversation thus far.
Moreover, our coding scheme achieves a communication rate of
$1-O(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ over oblivious channels and
$1-O(\sqrt{\varepsilon\log\log\tfrac{1}{\varepsilon}})$ over adaptive
adversarial channels, matching the conjecturally optimal rates. Lastly, we
point to connections between fault-tolerant circuits and coding for interactive

baryon asymmetry of the Universe to the dark matter density. A composite
particle in a new strong dynamics is a promising candidate for ADM as the
strong dynamics naturally explains the ADM mass in the GeV range. Its large
annihilation cross section due to the strong dynamics leaves the asymmetric
component to be dominant over the symmetric component. In such composite ADM
scenarios, the dark sector has a relatively large entropy density in the early
Universe. The large dark sector entropy results in the overclosure of the
Universe or at best contradicts with the observations of the cosmic microwave
background and the successful Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis. Thus, composite ADM
models generically require some portal to transfer the entropy of the dark
sector into the Standard Model sector. In this paper, we consider a dark photon
portal with a mass in the sub-GeV range and kinetic mixing with the Standard
Model photon. We investigate the viable parameter space of the dark photon in
detail, which can find broad applications to dark photon portal models. We also
provide a simple working example of composite ADM with a dark photon portal.
Our model is compatible with thermal leptogenesis and $B - L$ symmetry. By
taking into account the derived constraints, we show that the parameter space
is largely tested by direct detection experiments.

conceptually appealing, the protocol was found to be plagued with a number of
spectral crowding and leakage problems. Here we argue that by coupling the
qubits to a measuring device which continuously monitors leakage to higher
energy states (say, to a very lossy resonator of frequency omega =
E3(qubit)-E1(qubit), with 1 labeling the ground state of the qubit), we could
potentially restrict the multi-qubit system's evolution to its computational
subspace, thus circumventing the above mentioned problems.

two stages of particle acceleration during flux mergers: (i) fast explosive

acceleration occurs during the initial catastrophic X-point collapse, with the
reconnection electric field of the order of the magnetic field. During the
X-point collapse particles are accelerated by charge-starved electric fields,
which can reach (and even exceed) values of the local magnetic field. The
explosive stage of reconnection produces non-thermal power-law tails with
slopes that depend on the average magnetization $\sigma$. For plasma
magnetization $\sigma \leq 10^2$ the spectrum power law index is $p> 2$; in
this case the maximal energy depends linearly on the size of the reconnecting
islands. For higher magnetization, $\sigma \geq 10^2$, the spectra are hard,
$p< 2$, yet the maximal energy $\gamma_{max}$ can still exceed the average
magnetic energy per particle, $ \sim \sigma$, by orders of magnitude (if $p$ is
not too close to unity). The X-point collapse stage is followed by magnetic
island merger that dissipates a large fraction of the initial magnetic energy

relation in Java and other generic nominally-typed OO programming languages is
both interesting and intricate. In these languages, the subtyping relation
between ground object types, i.e., ones with no type variables, is the basis
for defining the full OO subtyping relation, i.e., that includes type
variables.
  As an ordering relation over the set of types, the subtyping relation in
object-oriented programming languages can always be represented as a directed
graph. In order to better understand some of the subtleties of the subtyping
relation in Java, in this paper we present how the subtyping relation between
ground Java types can be precisely constructed using two new operations (a
binary operation and a unary one) on directed graphs. The binary operation we
use, called a partial Cartesian graph product, is similar in its essence to
standard graph products and group products. Its definition is based in

Java subtyping relation reveals some of the not-immediately-obvious structure
of the subtyping relation not only in Java but, more generally, also in
mainstream generic nominally-typed OO programming languages such as C#, Scala

operations can be used to explicitly construct the subtyping relation in these

of features of the type systems of these languages such as wildcard types and

on a combination of VLT/FORS2, VLT/FLAMES, and Magellan/MIKE low- and
high-resolution spectroscopy of 32 and 27 member stars, respectively. Although
both clusters are located at Galactocentric distances of 15 kpc, they have
otherwise very different properties. M 75 is a luminous and metal-rich system
at [Fe/H] = $-1.2$ dex, a value that we confirm from the calcium triplet
region. This GC shows mild evidence for rotation with an amplitude of A$_{\rm
rot}\sim$5 km s$^{-1}$. One of the most metal-poor GCs in the Milky Way (at
[FeII/H] = $-2.3$ dex), NGC 6426 exhibits marginal evidence of internal
rotation at the 2 km s$^{-1}$ level. Both objects have velocity dispersions
that are consistent with their luminosity. Although limited by small-number
statistics, the resulting limits on their $A_{\rm rot}/\sigma_0$ ratios suggest
that M 75 is a slow rotator driven by internal dynamics rather than being
effected by the weak Galactic tides at its large distances. Here, M 75 ($A_{\rm
rot}/\sigma=0.31$) is fully consistent with the properties of other, younger
halo clusters. At $A_{\rm rot}/\sigma_0=0.8\pm0.4$, NGC 6426 appears to have a
remarkably ordered internal motion for its low metallicity, but the large
uncertainty does not allow for an unambiguous categorization as a fast rotator.
An accretion origin of M 75 cannot be excluded, based on the eccentric orbit,
which we derived from the recent data release 2 of Gaia, and considering its
younger age.

instantaneous long jumps of particles, thus defying causality. Since
interactions decaying as a power-law with distance, $r^{-\alpha}$, are

show that while the interactions are long-range, their effect on information
spreading is asymptotically negligible as long as $\alpha>1$. In this range we
find a complex compound behavior, where after a short transient a fully local
behavior emerges, yielding asymptotic ""light-cones"" virtually indistinguishable

neutron stars and perhaps even black holes receive large velocity kicks at
birth. Such natal kicks and the sudden mass loss can significantly alter the
orbital configuration of the system. Here we derive general analytical
expressions that describe the effects of natal kicks in binaries on
hierarchical triple systems. We explore several proof-of-concept applications
such as black hole and neutron stars binaries and X-ray binaries with either
stellar or Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) companions on a wide orbit. Kicks can
disrupt the hierarchical configuration, although it is harder to escape the
potential well of an SMBH. Some binary systems do escape the SMBH system
resulting in hyper-velocity binary system. Furthermore, kicks can result in
increasing or decreasing the orbital separations. Decreasing the orbital
separation may have significant consequences in these astrophysical systems.
For example, shrinking the separation post-supernova kick can lead to the
shrinking of an inner compact binary that then may merge via Gravitational Wave
(GW) emission. This process yields a supernova that is shortly followed by a
possible GW-LIGO event. Interestingly, we find that the natal kick can result
in shrinking the outer orbit, and the binary may cross the tertiary Roche
limit, breaking up the inner binary. Thus, in the case of SMBH companion, this
process can lead to either a tidal disruption event or a GW-LISA detection
event with a supernova precursor.

calculates the impact of turbulence on the average velocity of small bodies,
the radius for binary capture, and the sizes of the small bodies that can be
accreted. We also include the effect of turbulence on the particle scale
height, which has been studied in previous works. We find that turbulence does
not prevent rapid growth in the high-mass regime: the last doubling time to the
critical mass to trigger runaway gas accretion ($M \sim 10 \, M_\oplus$) is
well within the disk lifetime even for strong ($\alpha \gtrsim 10^{-2}$)

local properties of the protoplanetary disk, over large regimes of parameter
space large cores grow in less than the disk lifetime if appropriately-sized
small bodies are present. Instead, the effects of turbulence are most
pronounced for low planetary masses. For strong turbulence the growth timescale
is longer than the gas disk lifetime until the core reaches masses $\gtrsim

robustly address that, we employ large-scale cosmological hydrodynamic

their host galaxies have experienced a merger in the last 0.5~Gyr. These high
merger fractions, however, merely reflect the intrinsically high merger
fractions of massive galaxies at $z=2$, in which luminous AGN preferentially
occur. Apart from that, our simulations suggest that merger events are not the
statistically dominant fuelling mechanism for nuclear activity over a redshift
range $z=0-2$: irrespective of AGN luminosity, less than 20 per cent of AGN
hosts have on average undergone a recent merger, in agreement with a number of
observational studies. The central ISM conditions required for inducing AGN
activity can be, but are not necessarily caused by a merger. Despite the
statistically minor relevance of mergers, at a given AGN luminosity and stellar
mass, the merger fractions of AGN hosts can be by up to three times higher than
that of inactive galaxies. Such elevated merger fractions still point towards
an intrinsic connection between AGN and mergers, consistent with our
traditional expectation.

Several heavy particles, that can be thermally inaccessible in the early
Universe due to their masses being greater than the reheat temperature after
inflation, can play the role of portals between dark matter and Standard Model
particles through one loop couplings. Due to the loop suppression, one can
generate the required non-thermal dark matter couplings without any need of
highly fine tuned Yukawa couplings beyond that of electron Yukawa with the
Standard Model like Higgs boson. We show that generic values of Yukawa
couplings as large as $\mathcal{O}(0.01)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ can keep the dark
matter out of thermal equilibrium in the early Universe and produce the correct
relic abundance later through the freeze-in mechanism. Though the radiative
couplings of dark matter are tiny as required by the freeze-in scenario, the
associated rich particle sector of the model can be probed at ongoing and near

we employ a constant underlying dust extinction law in all cases, and examine
how the role of geometry and radiative transfer effects impact the resultant
attenuation curves. Our main results follow. Despite our usage of a constant
dust extinction curve, we find dramatic variations in the derived attenuation
laws. The slopes of normalized attenuation laws depend primarily on the
complexities of star-dust geometry. Increasing fractions of unobscured young
stars flatten normalized curves, while increasing fractions of unobscured old
stars steepen curves. Similar to the slopes of our model attenuation laws, we
find dramatic variation in the 2175 Angstrom ultraviolet (UV) bump strength,
including a subset of curves with little to no bump. These bump strengths are
primarily influenced by the fraction of unobscured O and B stars in our model,
with the impact of scattered light having only a secondary effect. Taken
together, these results lead to a natural relationship between the attenuation
curve slope and 2175 Angstrom bump strength. Finally, we apply these results to

x 4,096 sized images at 12 bpp to 2 bpp using lossless arithmetic coding, and
over the years JPEG and JPEG2000 were imbibed reaching upto 0.1 bpp. Inspired
by the reprise of deep learning based compression for natural images over the
last two years, we propose a fully convolutional autoencoder for diagnostically
relevant feature preserving lossy compression. This is followed by leveraging
arithmetic coding for encapsulating high redundancy of features for further
high-density code packing leading to variable bit length. We demonstrate
performance on two different publicly available digital mammography datasets
using peak signal-to-noise ratio (pSNR), structural similarity (SSIM) index and
domain adaptability tests between datasets. At high density compression factors
of >300x (~0.04 bpp), our approach rivals JPEG and JPEG2000 as evaluated
through a Radiologist's visual Turing test.

many packet replicas to transmit. We enhance the proposed Q-learning based

study to use BUDDI to fit and extract the spectra of the cD galaxy NGC 3311 and
its halo in an Integral Field Spectroscopy datacube, and carry out a simple
stellar populations analysis to study their star-formation histories. Using
MUSE data, we were able to isolate the light of the galaxy and its halo
throughout the datacube, giving spectra representing purely the light from each

indicates that, in this case, the bulk of the stars in both the halo and the
central galaxy are very old, but the halo is more metal poor and less
$\alpha$-enriched than the galaxy. This result is consistent with the halo
forming through the accretion of much smaller satellite galaxies with more
extended star formation. It is noteworthy that the apparent gradients in age

radially-varying contributions of galaxy and halo components, which

schemes. As proposed in Yuan and Lin [J. R. Statist. Soc. B, 68 (2006), 49-67],
the group lasso is a natural and computationally convenient approach to perform
variable selection in settings with categorical covariates. As pointed out by
Simon and Tibshirani [Stat. Sin., 22 (2011), 983-1001], ""standardization"" by
means of block-wise orthonormalization of column submatrices each corresponding
to one group of variables can substantially boost performance. In this note, we
study the aspect of standardization for the special case of categorical
predictors in detail. The main result is that orthonormalization is not
required; column-wise scaling of the design matrix followed by re-scaling and
centering of the coefficients is shown to have exactly the same effect. Similar
reductions can be achieved in the case of interactions. The extension to the
so-called sparse group lasso, which additionally promotes within-group
sparsity, is considered as well. The importance of proper standardization is

distribution of their measured opening angles suggests that the intrinsic
opening angles of the ionization cones has a mean value of 85--98$^\circ$ with
a finite spread of 39-44$^\circ$ (1-$\sigma$). Our inferred opening angle
distribution implies a number ratio of type I to type II AGN of 1:1.6--2.3,
consistent with other measurements of the type I / type II ratio at low AGN
luminosities. Combining these measurements with the WISE photometry data, we
find that redder mid-IR color (lower effective temperature of dust) corresponds
to stronger and narrower photo-ionized bicones. This relation is in agreement
with the unification model that suggests that the bi-conical narrow-line
regions are shaped by a toroidal dusty structure within a few pc from the AGN.
Furthermore, we find a significant alignment between the minor axis of host
galaxy disks and AGN ionization cones. Together, these findings suggest that
obscuration on both circumnuclear ($\sim $pc) and galactic ($\sim$ kpc) scales
are important in shaping and orienting the AGN narrow-line regions.

the primary driver of activity. We obtained spectra and maps of the CO J=2-1
rotational line at 230 GHz between 2017 December and 2018 January. We
calculated an average production rate of Q(CO)=(4.6+/-0.4)x10$^{28}$ mol
s$^{-1}$ at r ~2.9 au and delta ~2.1 au. The CO line is thin FWHM ~ 0.8 km
s$^{-1}$ with a slight blue-shift ~ -0.1 km s$^{-1}$ from the ephemeris
velocity, and we derive a gas expansion velocity of V$_{exp}$ = 0.50+/-0.15 km
s$^{-1}$. This comet produced approximately half the CO that comet C/1995 O1
(Hale-Bopp) did at 3 au. If CO production scales with nucleus surface area,
then the radius need not exceed ~15 km. The spectra and mapping data are
consistent with CO arising from a combination of a sunward-side active area and
an isotropic source. For HCN, we calculated a 3-sigma upper limit production
rate of Q(HCN) < 8x10$^{24}$ molecules s$^{-1}$, which corresponds to an
extraordinarily high abundance ratio limit of Q(CO)/Q(HCN) > 5000. We inferred
a production rate of molecular nitrogen of Q(N$_2$) ~2.8x10$^{27}$ molecules
s$^{-1}$ using our CO data and the reported N$_2$/CO column density ratio
(Cochran & MacKay 2018a,b). The comet does not show the typical nitrogen
depletion seen in comets, and the CO-rich, N$_2$-rich and HCN-depleted values
are consistent with formation in a cold environment of T < 50 K that may have
provided significant N$_2$ shielding.

fading by more than a factor of two at $3.4$ and $4.6 \mu$m since 2009. Swift
target-of-opportunity observations in 2017 show even stronger fading in the

this dramatic change are source fading or obscuration, where the latter is

which the strong UV continuum and/or broad optical hydrogen emission lines
associated with unobscured quasars either appear or disappear on timescales of
months to years. The physical processes responsible for this behaviour are
still debated, but changes in the black hole accretion rate or accretion disk
structure appear more likely than changes in obscuration. Here we report on
four epochs of spectroscopy of SDSS J110057.70-005304.5, a quasar at a redshift
of $z=0.378$ whose UV continuum and broad hydrogen emission lines have faded,
and then returned over the past $\approx$20 years. The change in this quasar
was initially identified in the infrared, and an archival spectrum from 2010
shows an intermediate phase of the transition during which the flux below
rest-frame $\approx$3400\AA\ has decreased by close to an order of magnitude.
This combination is unique compared to previously published examples of
changing-look quasars, and is best explained by dramatic changes in the
innermost regions of the accretion disk. The optical continuum has been rising
since mid-2016, leading to a prediction of a rise in hydrogen emission line
flux in the next year. Increases in the infrared flux are beginning to follow,
delayed by a $\sim$3 year observed timescale. If our model is confirmed, the
physics of changing-look quasars are governed by processes at the innermost
stable circular orbit (ISCO) around the black hole, and the structure of the
innermost disk. The easily identifiable and monitored changing-look quasars
would then provide a new probe and laboratory of the nuclear central engine.

concerned with a demonstration of medium fidelity astrometry accuracy and the
second milestone demonstrates high-contrast imaging utilizing the same
astrometry-capable optics. We have met milestone #1 with a comfortable margin.
The average accuracy obtained over the three datasets is 5.75e-5 L/D, which is
4 times better than the milestone requirement, or equivalent to 2.5microarcsec
on 2.4m telescope, or 1.5microarcsec for a 4m telescope, working in the visible

real benefit to the astronomy community. We also met milestone #2 and
demonstrated that it is possible to achieve high-contrast imaging utilizing a

milestone #2 of 5e-7 raw contrast for all of them. On average, we obtained
3.33e-7 raw contrast considering all data sets. This result is 35% better than

matter density profile of the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Draco's star
formation shut down long ago, making it a prime candidate for hosting a
'pristine' dark matter cusp, unaffected by stellar feedback during galaxy
formation. We first test GravSphere on a suite of tidally stripped mock
'Draco'-like dwarfs. We show that we are able to correctly infer the dark
matter density profile of both cusped and cored mocks within our 95% confidence
intervals. While we obtain only a weak inference on the logarithmic slope of
these density profiles, we are able to obtain a robust inference of the
amplitude of the inner dark matter density at 150pc, $\rho_{\rm DM}(150\,{\rm

radii, this is sufficient to distinguish a $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter
($\Lambda$CDM) cusp $-$ that has $\rho_{\rm DM}(150\,{\rm pc}) > 1.8 \times
10^8\,{\rm M}_\odot \,{\rm kpc}^{-3}$ $-$ from alternative dark matter models
that have lower inner densities. We then apply GravSphere to the real Draco

SIDM model, calibrated on $\Lambda$SIDM cosmological simulations, we show that
Draco's high central density gives an upper bound on the SIDM cross section of
$\sigma/m < 0.57\,{\rm cm}^2\,{\rm g}^{-1}$ at 99% confidence. We conclude that
the inner density of nearby dwarf galaxies like Draco provides a new and

ranked by stellar mass. For these samples we find that low-mass haloes in the
most dense environments are more likely to host a central galaxy than those in
the least dense environments. When splitting the halo population by formation
time, these relations are stronger. Hence, at a fixed low halo mass,
early-formed haloes are more likely to host a central galaxy than late-formed
haloes since they have had more time to assemble. The satellite occupation
shows a reverse trend where early-formed haloes host fewer satellites due to
having more time to merge with the central galaxy. We also analyse the stellar
mass -- halo mass relation for central galaxies in terms of the large-scale
environment and formation time of the haloes. We find that low mass haloes in
the most dense environment host relatively more massive central galaxies. This
trend is also found when splitting the halo population by age, with
early-formed haloes hosting more massive galaxies. Our results are in agreement

by radiative-convective climate models, which are used to predict surface
temperatures at user-specified levels of greenhouse gases. This approach
ignores the vital question of the (bio)geochemical plausibility of the proposed
chemical abundances. Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas in
Earth's atmosphere in terms of regulating planetary temperature, with the long

the sequestration of CO2 via chemical weathering and sedimentation, as
modulated by ocean chemistry, circulation and biological (microbial)

that proposed changes in global topography, tectonics, and the hydrological
cycle on larger planets results in proportionally greater surface temperatures

these changes results in average global surface temperature deviations of up to

driving in opposite directions exhibits jammed, phase separated, disordered,
and laning states. In active matter systems, such as a crowd of pedestrians,
driving in opposite directions is common and relevant, especially in conditions
which are characterized by high pedestrian density and emergency. In such
cases, the transition from laning to disordered states may be associated with
the onset of a panic state. We simulate a laning system containing active disks
that obey run-and-tumble dynamics, and we measure the drift mobility and
structure as a function of run length, disk density, and drift force. The
activity of each disk can be quantified based on the correlation timescale of
the velocity vector. We find that in some cases, increasing the activity can
increase the system mobility by breaking up jammed configurations; however, an
activity level that is too high can reduce the mobility by increasing the
probability of disk-disk collisions. In the laning state, the increase of
activity induces a sharp transition to a disordered strongly fluctuating state
with reduced mobility. We identify a novel drive-induced clustered laning state
that remains stable even at densities below the activity-induced clustering
transition of the undriven system.

updating blocks of variables in parallel. However, the speed and stability of
these algorithms depends on how the variables are partitioned into blocks. In
this paper, we give a stable parallel algorithm for inference in deep

is dominated by a moderately-beamed nuclear jet, at optical frequencies by the
accretion disk, and in the hard X-ray range by the disk corona. Our analysis
reveals a correlation (local and global significance of 96\% and 98\%,
respectively) between the optical and radio bands, with the disk lagging behind
the jet by $250 \pm 42$ days. We discuss the possible explanation for this,
speculating that the observed disk and the jet flux changes are generated by
magnetic fluctuations originating within the innermost parts of a truncated
disk, and that the lag is related to a delayed radiative response of the disk
when compared with the propagation timescale of magnetic perturbations along
relativistic outflow. This scenario is supported by the re-analysis of the
NuSTAR data, modelled in terms of a relativistic reflection from the disk
illuminated by the coronal emission, which returns the inner disk radius
$R_{\rm in}/R_{\rm ISCO} =35^{+40}_{-16}$. We discuss the global energetics in
the system, arguing that while the accretion proceeds at the Eddington rate,
with the accretion-related bolometric luminosity $L_{\rm bol} \sim 9 \times

$L_\textrm{j} \sim 4 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, inferred from the dynamical

task-oriented dialogue systems. For this task the Agenda-Based User Simulator
(ABUS) is often used. The ABUS is based on hand-crafted rules and its output is
in semantic form. Issues arise from both properties such as limited diversity
and the inability to interface a text-level belief tracker. This paper
introduces the Neural User Simulator (NUS) whose behaviour is learned from a
corpus and which generates natural language, hence needing a less labelled
dataset than simulators generating a semantic output. In comparison to much of
the past work on this topic, which evaluates user simulators on corpus-based
metrics, we use the NUS to train the policy of a reinforcement learning based
Spoken Dialogue System. The NUS is compared to the ABUS by evaluating the
policies that were trained using the simulators. Cross-model evaluation is
performed i.e. training on one simulator and testing on the other. Furthermore,
the trained policies are tested on real users. In both evaluation tasks the NUS
outperformed the ABUS.

as normal dwarf novae. We studied the peculiar outbursts in these three objects
via our optical photometry and spectroscopy, and performed numerical modeling
of their orbital variations to investigate their properties. We found that
their outbursts lasted for a long interval (a few tens of days), and that slow
rises in brightness were commonly observed during the early stage of their
outbursts. Our analyses and numerical modeling suggest that 1SWASP J1621 has a
very high inclination, close to 90 deg, plus a faint hot spot. Although BD Pav
seems to have a slightly lower inclination ($\sim$75 deg), the other properties
are similar to those in 1SWASP J1621. On the other hand, V364 Lib appears to
have a massive white dwarf, a hot companion star, and a low inclination
($\sim$35 deg). In addition, these three objects possibly have low transfer
rate and/or large disks originating from the long orbital periods. We find that
these properties of the three objects can explain their infrequent and
low-amplitude outbursts within the context of the disk instability model in
normal dwarf novae without strong magnetic field. In addition, we suggest that
the highly-ionized emission lines in outburst are observed due to a high
inclination and/or a massive white dwarf. More instances of this class of
object may be unrecognized, since their unremarkable outbursts can be easily
overlooked.

Restricting our attention to Cayley tables of finite groups, we prove two main

finite Abelian groups: the Cayley table of an Abelian group $G$ has chromatic
number $|G|$ or $|G|+2$, with the latter case occurring if and only if $G$ has
nontrivial cyclic Sylow 2-subgroups. Second, we give an upper bound for the

adversary gets physical access to the devices. In this paper, a novel secret
key generation method is proposed for IoTs that utilize the intrinsic
randomness embedded in the devices' memories introduced in the manufacturing
process. A fuzzy extractor structure using serially concatenated BCH-Polar
codes is proposed to generate reproducible keys from a ReRAM-based
\emph{ternary-state} Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) for device
authentication and secret key generation. The ReRAM based PUFs are the most
practical choice for authentication and key generation in IoT, as they operate
at or below the systems' noise level and therefore are less vulnerable to side
channel attacks compared to the alternative memory technologies. However, the
current ReRAM-based PUFs present a high false negative authentication rate
since the behavior of these devices can vary in different physical conditions
that results in a low probability of regenerating the same response in
different attempts. In this paper, we propose a secret key generation scheme
for ternary state PUFs that enables reliable reconstruction of the desired
secret keys utilizing a serially concatenated BCH-Polar fuzzy extractor. The
experimental results show that the proposed model can offer a significantly
lower probability of mismatch between the original key and the regenerated

the ('bare') noise-to-signal ratio (NSR) $\gamma\ge 0$, we consider the problem
of reconstructing ${\bf s}$ from its corrupted image by a Least Square Scheme
for a certain class of random Gaussian mappings. The problem is equivalent to
finding the configuration of minimal energy in a certain version of spherical

the Parisi replica symmetry breaking scheme to evaluate the mean overlap
$p_{\infty}\in [0,1]$ between the original signal and its recovered image
(known as 'estimator') as $N\to \infty$, which is a measure of the quality of
the signal reconstruction. We explicitly analyze the general case of
linear-quadratic family of random mappings and discuss the full $p_{\infty}

is not yet too big, the replica symmetric solution is necessarily broken in
some interval of NSR. We show that encryptions with a nonvanishing linear
component permit reconstructions with $p_{\infty}>0$ for any $\mu>1$ and any
$\gamma<\infty$, with $p_{\infty}\sim \gamma^{-1/2}$ as $\gamma\to \infty$. In
contrast, for the case of purely quadratic nonlinearity, for any ERP $\mu>1$
there exists a threshold NSR value $\gamma_c(\mu)$ such that $p_{\infty}=0$ for
$\gamma>\gamma_c(\mu)$ making the reconstruction impossible. The behaviour
close to the threshold is given by $p_{\infty}\sim (\gamma_c-\gamma)^{3/4}$ and
is controlled by the replica symmetry breaking mechanism.

absorption and second harmonic generation spectra. The differences arise
because of the relative importance of transition moments and the joint density
of states. We develop a simple model and globally fit the absorption and
harmonic generation spectra to extract the joint density of states and the
transition moments from these spectra. Our results validate previous
assignments of the C feature to a large joint density of states created by band
nesting.

its D3h point group symmetry makes conventional piezoresponse force microscopy

microscopy (SPM) technique that enables mapping of the piezoelectric response
of atomically thin WSe2 directly on a substrate with high spatial resolution.
Planar electrodes are used to excite piezoelectric vibrations while imposing
anisotropic in-plane mechanical constraint to the WSe2, resulting in an
out-of-plane deformation due to Poisson's effect that can be measured by an SPM
probe. Using this technique, we show that WSe2 monolayer and trilayers exhibit
strong electromechanical response linear to the applied excitation biases that
is distinct from the substrate, while WSe2 bilayer show negligible
electromechanical response as expected. The effective piezoelectric coefficient
is estimated to be 5.2 pm/V from the measurement, consistent with theoretical
predictions. This method can be conveniently applied to a wide range of 2D
materials with similar symmetry.

recent years due to its ability to produce state-of-the-art results in
challenging environments where non-hierarchical frameworks fail to learn useful
policies. However, as problem domains become more complex, deep hierarchical
reinforcement learning can become inefficient, leading to longer convergence
times and poor performance. We introduce the Deep Nested Agent framework, which
is a variant of deep hierarchical reinforcement learning where information from
the main agent is propagated to the low level $nested$ agent by incorporating
this information into the nested agent's state. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and performance of the Deep Nested Agent framework by applying it
to three scenarios in Minecraft with comparisons to a deep non-hierarchical
single agent framework, as well as, a deep hierarchical framework.

shallow layers are rich in fine spatial information and thus mainly responsible
for small object detection. The performance of small object detection, however,
is still less than satisfactory because of the deficiency of semantic
information on shallow feature maps. In this paper, we design a Multi-scale
Deconvolutional Single Shot Detector (MDSSD), especially for small object
detection. In MDSSD, multiple high-level feature maps at different scales are
upsampled simultaneously to increase the spatial resolution. Afterwards, we
implement the skip connections with low-level feature maps via Fusion Block.
The fusion feature maps, named Fusion Module, are of strong feature
representational power of small instances. It is noteworthy that these
high-level feature maps utilized in Fusion Block preserve both strong semantic
information and some fine details of small instances, rather than the top-most
layer where the representation of fine details for small objects are
potentially wiped out. The proposed framework achieves 77.6% mAP for small
object detection on the challenging dataset TT100K with 512 x 512 input,
outperforming other detectors with a large margin. Moreover, it can also
achieve state-of-the-art results for general object detection on PASCAL VOC2007

require solving for a permutation that optimally matches, ranks, or sorts some
data. These problems usually have a task-specific, often non-differentiable
objective function that data-driven algorithms can use as a learning signal. In
this paper, we propose the Sinkhorn Policy Gradient (SPG) algorithm for
learning policies on permutation matrices. The actor-critic neural network
architecture we introduce for SPG uniquely decouples representation learning of
the state space from the highly-structured action space of permutations with a
temperature-controlled Sinkhorn layer. The Sinkhorn layer produces continuous
relaxations of permutation matrices so that the actor-critic architecture can
be trained end-to-end. Our empirical results show that agents trained with SPG
can perform competitively on sorting, the Euclidean TSP, and matching tasks. We
also observe that SPG is significantly more data efficient at the matching task
than the baseline methods, which indicates that SPG is conducive to learning
representations that are useful for reasoning about permutations.

novel technology referred to as vehicle--to--vehicle (V2V) \textit{mode-3}.
Under this scheme, the eNodeB assists in the resource allocation process
allotting sidelink subchannels to vehicles. Thereupon, vehicles transmit their
signals in a broadcast manner without the intervention of the former one.
eNodeBs will thereby play a determinative role in the assignment of subchannels
as they can effectively manage V2V traffic and prevent allocation conflicts.
The latter is a crucial aspect to be enforced in order for the signals to be
received reliably by other vehicles. To this purpose, we propose two resource
allocation schemes namely bipartite graph matching-based successive allocation
(BGM-SA) and bipartite graph matching-based parallel allocation (BGM-PA) which
are suboptimal approaches with lesser complexity than exhaustive search. Both
schemes incorporate constraints to prevent allocation conflicts from emerging.
In this research, we consider overlapping clusters only, which could be formed
at intersections or merging highways. We show through simulations that BGM-SA
can attain near-optimal performance whereas BGM-PA is subpar but less complex.
Additionally, since BGM-PA is based on inter-cluster vehicle pre-grouping, we
explore different metrics that could effectively portray the overall channel
conditions of pre-grouped vehicles. This is of course not optimal in terms of
maximizing the system capacity---since the allocation process would be based on
simplified surrogate information---but it reduces the computational complexity.

relation to dust grain sizes and compositions. We here analyse a sample of 17
GRBs (0.34<z<7.84) where the ultraviolet to near-infrared spectroscopic
observations are available through the VLT/X-shooter instrument, giving us an
opportunity to fit individual extinction curves of GRBs for the first time. Our
sample is compiled on the basis that multi-band photometry is available around
the X-shooter observations. The X-shooter data are combined with the Swift
X-ray data and a single or broken power-law together with a parametric
extinction law is used to model the individual SEDs. We find 10 cases with
significant dust, where the derived extinction, AV, ranges from 0.1-1.0mag. In
four of those, the inferred extinction curves are consistent with the SMC
curve. The GRB individual extinction curves have a flat RV distribution with an
optimal weighted combined value of RV = 2.61+/-0.08 (for seven broad coverage
cases). The 'average GRB extinction curve' is similar to, but slightly steeper
than the typical SMC, and consistent with the SMC Bar extinction curve at ~95%

small grains, where large dust grains may be destroyed due to GRB activity.
Another possibility could be that young age and/or lower metallicities of GRBs
environments are responsible for the steeper curves.

either require styled training captions aligned to images or generate captions

relevant styled captions from a large corpus of styled text without aligned

representation generated using natural language processing techniques and frame
semantics. In addition, we develop a unified language model that decodes
sentences with diverse word choices and syntax for different styles.

strides in the past decade. However one major challenge for its applications to
coherent light sources and colliders is the relatively large energy spread of
the accelerated beams, currently at a few percent level. This energy spread is
usually correlated with particle position in the beam arising from the
longitudinal chirp of the wakefield amplitude. Therefore a dechirper is highly
desirable for reducing this spread down to $\sim0.1\%$ level, while at the same
time for maintaining the emittance of the accelerated beam. Here we propose
that a low-density hollow channel plasma can act as a near-ideal dechirper for
both electrons and positrons. We demonstrate the concept through large-scale
three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. We show that the initial
positive correlated energy spread (chirp) on the beam exiting a plasma
accelerator can be compensated by the nearly linear self-wake induced by the
beam in the hollow channel from few percent level down to $\leq 0.1\%$.
Meanwhile, the beam emittance can be preserved due to the negligible transverse
field inside the channel. This passive method may significantly improve the
beam quality of plasma-based accelerators, paving the way for their
applications to future compact free electron lasers and colliders.

vary with the solar cycle in the slowest solar wind streams and coronal

reframe manufacturability analysis and process planning into purely symbolic

GUs with one single fly and then leaves for another mission. In each scenario,
we aim to minimize the UAV periodic flight duration or mission completion time,

the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, a well-established method to estimate the
projected spin-orbit angle $\lambda$. Although the asteroseismic method has
been broadly applied to the Kepler data, its reliability has yet to be assessed
intensively. In this work, we evaluate the accuracy of $i_{\star}$ from
asteroseismology of solar-like stars using 3000 simulated power spectra. We
find that the low signal-to-noise ratio of the power spectra induces a
systematic under-estimate (over-estimate) bias for stars with high (low)
inclinations. We derive analytical criteria for the reliable asteroseismic
estimate, which indicates that reliable measurements are possible in the range
of $20^\circ \lesssim i_{\star} \lesssim 80^\circ$ only for stars with high
signal-to-noise ratio. We also analyse and measure the stellar inclination of
94 Kepler main-sequence solar-like stars, among which 33 are planetary hosts.
According to our reliability criteria, a third of them (9 with planets, 22
without) have accurate stellar inclination. Comparison of our asteroseismic
estimate of $v\sin{i_{\star}}$ against spectroscopic measurements indicates
that the latter suffers from a large uncertainty possibly due to the modeling
of macro-turbulence, especially for stars with projected rotation speed
$v\sin{i_{\star}} \lesssim 5$ km/s. This reinforces earlier claims, and the
stellar inclination estimated from the combination of measurements from
spectroscopy and photometric variation for slowly rotating stars needs to be
interpreted with caution.

recombination-generation (RG) and (ii) over the barrier (OTB) where OTB
dominates when barrier height $ phy_b<0.59eV $. Second, we analytically extract
the SBG II current (Iii) at 300K from experimental results. The drain current
(Id), the electric field (E-field), and Iii are plotted in time. We observe
that Iii increase as E-field reduces which indicates that E-field does not
primarily contribute to Iii. Further, the Id shows two distinct behaviors (i)
Iii (Id) is constant at the beginning and (ii) eventually universal Iii (Id) is
linear, i.e. Iii=k X Id where $ k=10^-3$; We also show that the electrons
primarily contributing to Id are directly incapable of II due to insufficient
energy $(<Eg)$. Fischetti's model showed that SBG-II is primarily caused by hot
electrons that accept energy in an Auger-like process from cold drain electrons
to enable SBG-II. We speculate that if the Id electrons heat-up the cold drain

promotes accumulation of cellular debris and extracellular fat in the inner
artery wall. This material is highly thrombogenic, and plaque rupture can lead
to the formation of blood clots that occlude major arteries and cause
myocardial infarction or stroke. In advanced plaques, vascular smooth muscle
cells (SMCs) migrate from deeper in the artery wall to synthesise a cap of
fibrous tissue that stabilises the plaque and sequesters the thrombogenic
plaque content from the bloodstream. The fibrous cap provides crucial
protection against the clinical consequences of atherosclerosis, but the
mechanisms of cap formation are poorly understood. In particular, it is unclear
why certain plaques become stable and robust while others become fragile and
vulnerable to rupture.
  We develop a multiphase model with non-standard boundary conditions to
investigate early fibrous cap formation in the atherosclerotic plaque. The
model is parameterised using a range of in vitro and in vivo data, and includes
highly nonlinear mechanisms of SMC proliferation and migration in response to
an endothelium-derived chemical signal. We demonstrate that the model SMC
population naturally evolves towards a steady-state, and predict a rate of cap
formation and a final plaque SMC content consistent with experimental
observations in mice. Parameter sensitivity simulations show that SMC
proliferation makes a limited contribution to cap formation, and highlight that
stable cap formation relies on a critical balance between SMC recruitment to
the plaque, SMC migration within the plaque and SMC loss by apoptosis. The
model represents the first detailed in silico study of fibrous cap formation in
atherosclerosis, and establishes a multiphase modelling framework that can be
readily extended to investigate many other aspects of plaque development.

luminosities ($L_{\rm OIII}$) by combining a physical model of HII regions with
emission line calculations using the photoionization code CLOUDY. We show that
the resulting $L_{\rm OIII}$, for a given star formation rate, is slightly
higher than predicted from the empirical relation for local galaxies, and is
consistent with recent observations of galaxies at redshifts 7 - 9. Bright
[OIII] emitters with $L_{\rm OIII} > 10^8 {\rm L_\odot}$ have stellar masses
greater than $10^9\ {\rm M_\odot}$, star formation rates higher than $3\ {\rm

The galaxies are hosted by dark matter halos with masses greater than

where the [OIII] emitting gas largely overlaps with young stars, but the
emission peak is separated from the main stellar population, suggesting the
stochastic and localized nature of star formation in the first galaxies. We

J051814.33+294113.0, we discovered very deep eclipses. The observations were

The large time span, during which we observed the eclipses, allowed us to
measure the orbital period in IPHAS J051814.33+294113.0 with high precision,
Porb=0.20603098+/-0.00000025 d. The prominent parts of the eclipses lasted
0.1+/-0.01 phases or 30+/-3 min. The depth of the eclipses was variable in the
range 1.8-2.9 mag. The average eclipse depth was equal to 2.42+/-0.06 mag. The
prominent parts of the eclipses revealed a smooth and symmetric shape. We
derived the eclipse ephemeris, which, according to the precision of the orbital
period, has a formal validity time of 500 years. This ephemeris can be useful
for future investigations of the long-term period changes. During the latter
four observational nights in 2017 January, we observed the sharp brightness
decrease of IPHAS J051814.33+294113.0 by 2.3 mag. This brightness decrease
imitated the end of the dwarf nova outburst. However, the long-term light curve
of IPHAS J051814.33+294113.0 obtained in the course of the Catalina Sky Survey

J051814.33+294113.0 is a novalike variable. Moreover, the sharp brightness
decrease, which we observed in IPHAS J051814.33+294113.0, suggests that this
novalike variable belongs to the VY Scl-subtype. Due to very deep eclipses,
IPHAS J051814.33+294113.0 is suitable to study the accretion disc structure

complexity. On the other hand, heuristic methods have low complexity but
provide relatively poor performance. We resort to machine learning-based

including the first Li-rich giant with evolutionary stage confirmed by CoRoT

analyses using medium-resolution GIRAFFE or high-resolution UVES spectra. These
results are part of the fifth internal data release of Gaia-ESO. The Li
abundances were corrected for non-LTE effects. We used Gaia DR2 parallaxes to
estimate distances and luminosities. The giants have A(Li) > 2.2 dex. The
majority of them (14 out of 20 stars) are in the CoRoT fields. Four giants are
located in the field of three open clusters but are not members. Two giants
were observed in fields towards the Galactic bulge but are likely in the inner
disk. One of the bulge field giants is super Li-rich with A(Li) = 4.0 dex. We
identified one giant with infrared excess at 22 microns. Two other giants, with
large vsin i, might be Li-rich because of planet engulfment. Another giant is
found to be barium enhanced and thus could have accreted material from a former
AGB companion. Otherwise, besides the Li enrichment, the evolutionary stages
are the only other connection between these new Li-rich giants. The CoRoT data
confirm that one Li-rich giant is at the core-He burning stage. The other
giants are concentrated in close proximity to the RGB luminosity bump, the
core-He burning stages, or the early-AGB. This is very clear when looking at
the Gaia-based luminosities of the Li-rich giants. This is also seen when the
CoRoT Li-rich giants are compared to a larger sample of 2252 giants observed in
the CoRoT fields by the Gaia-ESO Survey, which are distributed all over the RGB
in the Teff-logg diagram. These observations show that evolutionary stage is a
major factor behind the Li enrichment in giants. Other processes, like planet
accretion, contribute to a smaller scale. [abridged]

candidates from multi-night ground based survey data. Our method uses a
combination of random forests and self-organising-maps to rank planetary

using injected transit signals to form a training set, a necessary development
for applying similar methods to upcoming surveys. We also make the

\texttt{autovet} is designed to perform machine learned vetting of planetary

a consequence of the impact degassing and atmospheric erosion during the late

-- roughly two orders of magnitude -- between the abundances of noble gases and
nitrogen in the present-day atmospheres on Venus, Earth, and Mars. The element
partitioning on planetary surfaces is thought to be significantly different
between the three planets ~4 Ga: the runaway greenhouse on Venus, the
carbon-silicate cycle and ocean formation on Earth, and the CO2-ice and H2O-ice
formation on Mars. Consequences of element partitioning for the atmospheric
evolution during the late accretion onto Venus, Earth, and Mars are
investigated with a numerical model. We set upper limits to the partial
pressures of CO2 and H2O on Earth and Mars, which corresponds to the state of
phase equilibrium and carbon-silicate cycle. The final N2 mass shrinks by ~40%
and ~15% for Earth and Mars, respectively. The effect of element partitioning
is found to be insufficient to reproduce the gaps. For Venus, the survival of
the primordial atmosphere through the late accretion may partially account for
the present-day atmosphere. Whereas on Mars, the atmospheric escape due to
solar extreme UV and wind may have also influenced the atmospheric evolution.

dimensional Minkowski or (A)dS spacetime. We show that this highlights the
possibility that the algebra of functions on the gauge bundle becomes

that this is a phenomena unique to characteristics $2$ and $5$. The result is
strongly related to the supersingularity of certain curves associated with
cyclotomic function fields, and in particular it complements an
equidistribution result of Katz.

provides a canonical example of a quantum spin liquid. Spin excitations from
the ground state are fractionalized into emergent matter fermions and $Z_2$
fluxes. The $Z_2$ flux excitation is pointlike in two dimensions, while it
comprises a closed loop in three dimensions because of the local constraint for
each closed volume. In addition, the fluxes obey global constraints involving
(semi)macroscopic number of fluxes. We here investigate such global constraints
in the Kitaev model on a three-dimensional lattice composed of nine-site
elementary loops, dubbed the hypernonagon lattice, whose ground state is a
chiral spin liquid. We consider two different anisotropic limits of the
hypernonagon Kitaev model where the low-energy effective models are described
solely by the $Z_2$ fluxes. We show that there are two kinds of global
constraints in the model defined on a three-dimensional torus, namely, surface
and volume constraints: the surface constraint is imposed on the even-odd
parity of the total number of fluxes threading a two-dimensional slice of the
system, while the volume constraint is for the even-odd parity of the number of
the fluxes through specific plaquettes whose total number is proportional to
the system volume. In the two anisotropic limits, therefore, the elementary
excitation of $Z_2$ fluxes occurs in a pair of closed loops so as to satisfy
both two global constraints as well as the local constraints.

distance measure which brings data points from the same class closer together
and pushes data points from different classes further apart. Recent research
has demonstrated that metric learning approaches can also be applied to trees,
such as molecular structures, abstract syntax trees of computer programs, or
syntax trees of natural language, by learning the cost function of an edit
distance, i.e. the costs of replacing, deleting, or inserting nodes in a tree.
However, learning such costs directly may yield an edit distance which violates
metric axioms, is challenging to interpret, and may not generalize well. In
this contribution, we propose a novel metric learning approach for trees which
learns an edit distance indirectly by embedding the tree nodes as vectors, such
that the Euclidean distance between those vectors supports class
discrimination. We learn such embeddings by reducing the distance to
prototypical trees from the same class and increasing the distance to
prototypical trees from different classes. In our experiments, we show that our
proposed metric learning approach improves upon the state-of-the-art in metric
learning for trees on six benchmark data sets, ranging from computer science
over biomedical data to a natural-language processing data set containing over

investigate the evolution of the bar properties, including their size, strength

Fourier, Jacobi integral, and moment of inertia methods. The interaction of the
two bars, which rotate at distinct speeds, primarily affects the size, strength
and pattern speed of the inner bar. When the two bars are perpendicular to each
other, the size and the pattern speed of the inner bar decrease and its
strength increases. The emergence of a strong Fourier $m=1$ mode increases the
oscillation amplitude of the size, strength and pattern speed of the inner bar.
On the other hand, the characteristics of the outer bar are substantially
influenced by its adjacent spiral structure. When the spiral structure
disappears, the size of the outer bar increases and its strength and pattern
speed decrease. Consequently, the ratio of the pattern speed of the outer bar
with respect to the inner bar is not constant and increases with time. Overall,
the double bar and disk system displays substantial high frequency semi-chaotic
fluctuations of the pattern strengths and speeds both in space and time,
superposed on the slow secular evolution, which invalidates the assumption that
the actions of individual stars should be well conserved in barred galaxies,

with other advent technologies, such as wireless network virtualization and

Then, for the delivery phase, we propose a delivery policy based on the user

high-computational complexities. For each phase, we show how the problem can be

affected by the contribution of non-thermal pressure components, due e.g. to
kinetic gas energy. The characterization of possible ordered motions (e.g.
rotation) of the intra-cluster medium could be important to recover cluster
masses accurately. We update the study of gas rotation in clusters through the
maps of the kinetic Sunyaev--Zel'dovich effect, using a large sample of massive
synthetic galaxy clusters ($ M_{vir} > 5\times 10^{14} h^{-1}$M$_\odot$ at
$z~=~0 $) from MUSIC high-resolution simulations. We select few relaxed objects
showing peculiar rotational features, as outlined in a companion work. To
verify whether it is possible to reconstruct the expected radial profile of the
rotational velocity, we fit the maps to a theoretical model accounting for a
specific rotational law, referred as the vp2b model. We find that our procedure
allows to recover the parameters describing the gas rotational velocity profile
within two standard deviations, both with and without accounting for the bulk
velocity of the cluster. The amplitude of the temperature distortion produced
by the rotation is consistent with theoretical estimates found in the
literature, and it is of the order of 23 per cent of the maximum signal
produced by the cluster bulk motion. We also recover the bulk velocity
projected on the line of sight consistently with the simulation true value.

parameter datasets to constrain the model parameters. It has been found that
for each of these dataset, the transition in deceleration parameter $q$ takes
place at the recent past ($z<1$). The future evolution of $q$ is also discussed
in the context of the model under consideration. Furthermore, using those

parameter for the scalar field. The results show that the reconstructed forms
of $q(z)$ and $\omega_{\phi}(z)$ do not differ much from the standard
$\Lambda$CDM value at the current epoch. Finally, the functional form of the
relevant potential $V(\phi)$ is derived by a parametric reconstruction from the
observational dataset. The corresponding $V(\phi)$ comes out to be a double
exponential potential which has a number of cosmological implications.
Additionally, we have also studied the effect of this particular scalar field

missing data at the level of aggregated variables (e.g. QALYs), which are
obtained by combining the economic data over the duration of the study, and are
often conducted under a missing at random (MAR) assumption. However, this
approach may lead to incorrect inferences since it ignores the longitudinal
nature of the data and may end up discarding a considerable amount of
observations from the analysis. We propose the use of joint longitudinal models

the longitudinal structure and incorporate all available data to improve the

inference from such black-box simulation-based models, under the constraint of
a very limited simulation budget (typically a few thousand). To do so, we adopt
an approach based on the likelihood of an alternative parametric model.
Conventional approaches to approximate Bayesian computation such as
likelihood-free rejection sampling are impractical for the considered problem,
due to the lack of knowledge about how the parameters affect the discrepancy
between observed and simulated data. As a response, we make use of a strategy
previously developed in the machine learning literature (Bayesian optimisation
for likelihood-free inference, BOLFI), which combines Gaussian process
regression of the discrepancy to build a surrogate surface with Bayesian
optimisation to actively acquire training data. We extend the method by
deriving an acquisition function tailored for the purpose of minimising the
expected uncertainty in the approximate posterior density, in the parametric
approach. The resulting algorithm is applied to the problems of summarising
Gaussian signals and inferring cosmological parameters from the Joint
Lightcurve Analysis supernovae data. We show that the number of required
simulations is reduced by several orders of magnitude, and that the proposed
acquisition function produces more accurate posterior approximations, as
compared to common strategies.

candidates, the catalogue gives not only their transit parameters but also the
products of their light curve modelling, together with a summary of the outcome
of follow-up observations when carried out and their current status. Among the
planet candidates whose nature remains unresolved, we estimate that 8 +/- 3
planets are still to be identified. We derived planet and brown dwarf
occurrences and confirm disagreements with Kepler estimates: small-size planets
with orbital period less than ten days are underabundant by a factor of three
in the CoRoT fields whereas giant planets are overabundant by a factor of two.
These preliminary results would however deserve further investigations using
the recently released CoRoT light curves that are corrected of the various
instrumental effects and a homogeneous analysis of the stellar populations
observed by the two missions.

in low surface brightness (LSB) disc galaxies, with central surface brightness
in the B band $\mu_0 \geq 23 \, mag \, arcsec^{-2}$. The sample is composed by
72 objects, whose rotation curves show an orderly trend reflecting the idea of
a universal rotation curve (URC) similar to that found in the local high
surface brightness (HSB) spirals in previous works. This curve relies on the
mass modelling of the coadded rotation curves, involving the contribution from
an exponential stellar disc and a Burkert cored dark matter halo. We find that
the dark matter is dominant especially within the smallest and less luminous
LSB galaxies. Dark matter halos have a central surface density $\Sigma _0 \sim
100 \, M_{\odot} pc^{-2}$, similar to galaxies of different Hubble types and
luminosities. We find various scaling relations among the LSBs structural
properties which turn out to be similar but not identical to what has been
found in HSB spirals. In addition, the investigation of these objects calls for
the introduction of a new luminous parameter, the stellar compactness $C_*$
(analogously to a recent work by Karukes \& Salucci), alongside with the
optical radius and the optical velocity in order to reproduce the URC.
Furthermore, a mysterious entanglement between the properties of the luminous
and the dark matter emerges.

probability distributions as a method to obtain a Gibbs measure under some
restriction giving the probability that a system will be in a certain state
compared to the rest of the elements in the distribution. Because classical
entropy-based Maxent collapses cases confounding all distinct degrees of
randomness and pseudo-randomness, here we take into consideration the
generative mechanism of the systems considered in the ensemble to separate
objects that may comply with the principle under some restriction and whose
entropy is maximal but may be generated recursively from those that are
actually algorithmically random offering a refinement to classical Maxent. We
take advantage of a causal algorithmic calculus to derive a thermodynamic-like
result based on how difficult it is to reprogram a computer code. Using the
distinction between computable and algorithmic randomness we quantify the cost
in information loss associated with reprogramming. To illustrate this we apply
the algorithmic refinement to Maxent on graphs and introduce a Maximal
Algorithmic Randomness Preferential Attachment (MARPA) Algorithm, a
generalisation over previous approaches. We discuss practical implications of
evaluation of network randomness. Our analysis provides insight in that the
reprogrammability asymmetry appears to originate from a non-monotonic
relationship to algorithmic probability. Our analysis motivates further
analysis of the origin and consequences of the aforementioned asymmetries,
reprogrammability, and computation.

partially known distributions is to compute the average of function values

ensures the correct stationary distribution of the resulting Markov chain.
However, the rejection of proposals causes highly correlated samples. In
particular, when a state is rejected it is not taken any further into account.
In contrast to that we consider a MH importance sampling estimator which
explicitly incorporates all proposed states generated by the MH algorithm. The
estimator satisfies a strong law of large numbers as well as a central limit
theorem, and, in addition to that, we provide an explicit mean squared error
bound. Remarkably, the asymptotic variance of the MH importance sampling
estimator does not involve any correlation term in contrast to its classical

information as the classical MH estimator, it can outperform the latter in
scenarios of moderate dimensions as indicated by numerical experiments.

cellular communication with UAVs as new aerial communication platforms serving
the terrestrial users. Then, we focus on the former paradigm and study a new
UAV trajectory design problem subject to practical communication connectivity
constraints with the GBSs. Specifically, we consider a cellular-connected UAV
in the mission of flying from an initial location to a final location, during
which it needs to maintain reliable communication with the cellular network by
associating with one GBS at each time instant. We aim to minimize the UAV's
mission completion time by optimizing its trajectory, subject to a
quality-of-connectivity constraint of the GBS-UAV link specified by a minimum
receive signal-to-noise ratio target. To tackle this challenging non-convex

feasibility. Next, by examining the GBS-UAV association sequence over time, we
obtain useful structural results on the optimal UAV trajectory, based on which
two efficient methods are proposed to find high-quality approximate trajectory
solutions by leveraging graph theory and convex optimization techniques. The
proposed methods are analytically shown to be capable of achieving a flexible

arbitrarily close to the optimal solution in polynomial time. Finally, we make

in the IBM quantum processors is performed to compute gate error in order to
check viability of complex quantum operations in the superconductivity-based
quantum computers introduced by IBM and to compare the quality of these gates
with the corresponding gates implemented using other technologies. Quantum
process tomography (QPT) of C-NOT gates have been performed for three
configurations available in IBM QX4 processor. For all the other allowed gates
QPT have been performed for every allowed position (i.e., by placing the gates
in different qubit lines) for IBM QX4 architecture, and thus, gate fidelities
are obtained for both single-qubit and 2-qubit gates. Gate fidelities are
observed to be lower than the corresponding values obtained in the other
technologies, like NMR. Further, gate fidelities for all the single-qubit gates
are obtained for IBM QX2 architecture by placing the gates in the third qubit
line ($q[2]$). It's observed that the IBM QX4 architecture yields better gate
fidelity compared to IBM QX2 in all cases except the case of $\operatorname{Y}$
gate as far as the gate fidelity corresponding to the third qubit line is
concerned. In general, the analysis performed here leads to a conclusion that a
considerable technological improvement would be inevitable to achieve the
desired scalability required for the realization of complex quantum operations.

of scalar potentials for the inflaton, namely chaotic inflation with a quartic
monomial potential, a Higgs-like symmetry breaking potential and a
non-renormalizable plateau-like potential. In each case, we determine the
parametric regimes in which the dynamical evolution is consistent for 50-60
e-folds of inflation, taking into account thermal corrections to the scalar
potential and requiring, in particular, that the two fermions coupled directly
to the inflaton remain relativistic and close to thermal equilibrium throughout
the slow-roll regime and that the temperature is always below the underlying
gauge symmetry breaking scale. We then compute the properties of the primordial
spectrum of scalar curvature perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio in
the allowed parametric regions and compare them with Planck data, showing that
this scenario is theoretically and observationally successful for a broad range
of parameter values.

proposed model minimizes the worst case (maximum) of Stein's loss across all

the normal distribution characterized by the sample mean and the sample
covariance matrix. We prove that this estimation problem is equivalent to a
semidefinite program that is tractable in theory but beyond the reach of
general purpose solvers for practically relevant problem dimensions $p$. In the
absence of any prior structural information, the estimation problem has an
analytical solution that is naturally interpreted as a nonlinear shrinkage
estimator. Besides being invertible and well-conditioned even for $p>n$, the
new shrinkage estimator is rotation-equivariant and preserves the order of the
eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix. These desirable properties are not
imposed ad hoc but emerge naturally from the underlying distributionally robust
optimization model. Finally, we develop a sequential quadratic approximation

a fast, deterministic $(2,O(\ell))$-ruling edge set algorithm for hypergraphs

submillimeter-selected galaxy discovered and remains an archetype of the class,
comprising a merger of several massive and active components, including a
quasar-luminosity AGN and a highly obscured, gas-rich starburst spread over a
~25 kpc extent. The GBT CO(1-0) line profile is comprised of two distinct
velocity components separated by about 600 km/s and suggests the presence of a
new component of molecular gas that had not been previously identified. The
CO(3-2) observations with ALMA show that this new component, designated W1, is
associated with a large extended structure stretching 13 kpc westward from the
AGN. W1 is not detected in the ALMA CO(7-6) data implying that this gas has
much lower CO excitation than the central starburst regions which are bright in
CO(7-6). The molecular gas mass of W1 is about 30% of the total molecular gas
mass in the system, depending on the CO--to--H_2 conversion factor. W1 is
arguably a merger remnant; alternatively, it could be a massive molecular
outflow associated with the AGN, or perhaps inflowing metal-enriched molecular
gas fueling the ongoing activity.

micro particles in a bounded environment. In geometries containing confining
walls, physical laws determine the behavior of the random trajectories at the
boundaries. For impenetrable walls, imposing reflecting boundary conditions to
the Brownian particles leads to dynamics described by reflecting stochastic
differential equations. In practice, these stochastic differential equations as
well as their refinements are quite challenging to handle, and more
importantly, many physical processes are better modeled by processes
conditioned to stay in a prescribed bounded region. In the mathematical
literature, these processes are known as taboo processes, and despite their
simplicity, at least compared to the reflecting stochastic differential
equations approach, are surprisingly not much exploited in physics. This paper
explores some aspect of taboo processes and other constrained processes in
simple geometries: Interval in one dimension, circular annulus in two
dimensions, hollow sphere in three dimensions, and more. In particular, for the
two-dimensional taboo process in a circular annulus, the Gaussian behavior of
the stochastic angle is established.

Waves of vorticity due to the Coriolis force, known as Rossby waves, are
expected to remove energy out of convection at the largest scales. Here we
unambiguously detect and characterize retrograde-propagating vorticity waves in
the shallow subsurface layers of the Sun at angular wavenumbers below fifteen,

lifetimes of several months, well-defined mode frequencies below 200 nHz in a

Rossby waves have nearly as much vorticity as the convection at the same

of random matrix theory for the statistical behavior of the celebrated Riemann
$\zeta$-function (and $L$-functions in general), which was discovered by
Montgomery (with regard to zeros of $L$-functions) and by Keating and Snaith
(with regard to values of $L$-functions).
  The first results revolve around a new operation on partitions, which we call
overlap. We prove two overlap identities for so-called Littlewood-Schur
functions. The first overlap identity represents the Littlewood-Schur function
$LS _\lambda(X; Y)$ as a sum over subsets of $X$, while the second overlap
identity essentially represents $LS_\lambda(X; Y)$ as a sum over pairs of
partitions whose overlap equals $\lambda$. Both identities are derived by
applying Laplace expansion to a determinantal formula for Littlewood-Schur
functions due to Moens and Van der Jeugt. In addition, we give two visual
characterizations for the set of all pairs of partitions whose overlap is equal
to a partition $\lambda$.
  The second result is an asymptotic formula for averages of mixed ratios of
characteristic polynomials over the unitary group, where mixed ratios are
products of ratios and/or logarithmic derivatives. Our proof of this formula is
a generalization of Bump and Gamburd's elegant combinatorial proof of Conrey,
Forrester and Snaith's formula for averages of ratios of characteristic
polynomials over the unitary group. The generalization relies on three
combinatorial results, namely the first overlap identity, a new variant of the
Murnaghan-Nakayama rule and an idea from vertex operator formalism. We conclude
this thesis by explaining how this approach might lead to new number theoretic
proofs.

overlap. We prove two overlap identities for so-called Littlewood-Schur
functions. Littlewood-Schur functions are a generalization of Schur functions,
whose study was introduced by Littlewood. More concretely, the Littlewood-Schur
function $LS_\lambda(X; Y)$ indexed by the partition $\lambda$ is a polynomial
in the variables $X \cup Y$ that is symmetric in both $X$ and $Y$ separately.
The first overlap identity represents $LS _\lambda(X; Y)$ as a sum over subsets
of $X$, while the second overlap identity essentially represents $LS_\lambda(X;
Y)$ as a sum over pairs of partitions whose overlap equals $\lambda$. Both
identities are derived by applying Laplace expansion to a determinantal formula
for Littlewood-Schur functions due to Moens and Van der Jeugt. In addition, we
give two visual characterizations for the set of all pairs of partitions whose

important characteristic of the numerical method is that it is directly applied
to the nonlocal equation by introducing the discrete convolution operator.
Starting from the continuous Cauchy problem defined on the real line, we first
construct the discrete Cauchy problem on a uniform grid of the real line. Thus
the semi-discretization in space of the continuous problem gives rise to an
infinite system of ordinary differential equations in time. We show that the
initial-value problem for this system is well-posed. We prove that solutions of
the discrete problem converge uniformly to those of the continuous one as the
mesh size goes to zero and that they are second-order convergent in space. We
then consider a truncation of the infinite domain to a finite one. We prove
that the solution of the truncated problem approximates the solution of the
continuous problem when the truncated domain is sufficiently large. Finally, we
present some numerical experiments that confirm numerically both the expected
convergence rate of the semi-discrete scheme and the ability of the method to
capture finite-time blow-up of solutions for various convolution kernels.

consider here the leading effects due to current-quadrupole moments induced by
gravitomagnetic tidal fields. We employ an effective action approach to
determine the near-zone gravitational field and the conservative orbital
dynamics, initially allowing for arbitrary (not just tidally induced)
current-quadrupoles; our approach significantly reduces the complexity of the

terms of the bodies' quadrupolar gravitomagnetic tidal Love numbers (tidal
linear response coefficients in an adiabatic approximation). In the phase,

comprehensive numerical evidence that it does yield near-optimal results after
significantly shorter runtimes. For example, 10000 samples in $\mathbb{R}^2$
are processed in two seconds, rather than in $\approx 14$ hours required by the
previous approach to terminate. For higher dimensions, density estimation
becomes tractable as well: Processing $10000$ samples in $\mathbb{R}^6$
requires 35 minutes. The software is publicly available as CRAN R package

dynamical systems has proven a long-standing and complex problem. In many
situations, the dynamics may be described by a Langevin equation while
constructing a landscape comes down to obtaining the quasi-potential, a scalar
function that quantifies the likelihood of reaching each point in the
state-space. In this work we provide a novel method for constructing such
landscapes by extending a tool from control theory: the Sum-of-Squares method
for generating Lyapunov functions. Applicable to any system described by
polynomials, this method provides an analytical polynomial expression for the
potential landscape, in which the coefficients of the polynomial are obtained
via a convex optimization problem. The resulting landscapes are based upon a
decomposition of the deterministic dynamics of the original system, formed in
terms of the gradient of the potential and a remaining ""curl"" component. By
satisfying the condition that the inner product of the gradient of the
potential and the remaining dynamics is everywhere negative, our derived
landscapes provide both upper and lower bounds on the true quasi-potential;
these bounds becoming tight if the decomposition is orthogonal. The method is
demonstrated to correctly compute the quasi-potential for high-dimensional
linear systems and also for a number of nonlinear examples.

that the proposed XOGAN model can generate plausible images and control

applications ranging from deblurring, image inpainting, source separation etc.
Most existing techniques solve such inverse problems by either explicitly or
implicitly finding the inverse of the model. The former class of techniques
require explicit knowledge of the measurement process which can be unrealistic,
and rely on strong analytical regularizers to constrain the solution space,
which often do not generalize well. The latter approaches have had remarkable
success in part due to deep learning, but require a large collection of
source-observation pairs, which can be prohibitively expensive. In this paper,
we propose an unsupervised technique to solve inverse problems with generative
adversarial networks (GANs). Using a pre-trained GAN in the space of source
signals, we show that one can reliably recover solutions to under determined
problems in a `blind' fashion, i.e., without knowledge of the measurement
process. We solve this by making successive estimates on the model and the
solution in an iterative fashion. We show promising results in three
challenging applications -- blind source separation, image deblurring, and
recovering an image from its edge map, and perform better than several
baselines.

inductively coupled plasma, then released to drift for some seconds in a dc

reversed. DC plasma containing a drifting microparticle cloud was found to be
strongly non-uniform in terms of microparticle drift velocity and plasma
emission in accord with [Zobnin et.al., Phys. Plasmas 25, 033702 (2018)]. In
addition to that, non-uniformity in the self-excited wave pattern was observed:
In the front edge of the microparticle cloud (defined as head), the waves had
larger phase velocity than in the rear edge (defined as tail). Also, after the
polarity reversal, the wave pattern exhibited several bifurcations: Between
each of the two old wave crests, a new wave crest has formed. These
bifurcations, however, occurred only in the head of the microparticle cloud. We
show that spatial variations of electric field inside the drifting cloud play
an important role in the formation of the wave pattern. Comparison of the

us to study the effect of nodes having limited communication capacity on the
complexity of distributed graph computations. In this model, the $n$ nodes of a
network are connected as a clique and communicate in synchronous rounds. In
each round, every node can exchange messages of $O(\log n)$ bits with at most
$O(\log n)$ other nodes. When solving a graph problem, the input graph $G$ is
defined on the same set of $n$ nodes, where each node knows which other nodes

for a data-driven and principled way to identify the number and composition of
salient, reoccurring brain states present during sleep. To this end, we propose
a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM), combined with
wide-sense stationary (WSS) time series spectral estimation to construct a
generative model for personalized subject sleep states. In addition, we employ
multitaper spectral estimation to further reduce the large variance of the
spectral estimates inherent to finite-length EEG measurements. By applying our
method to both simulated and human sleep data, we arrive at three main results:
1) a Bayesian nonparametric automated algorithm that recovers general temporal
dynamics of sleep, 2) identification of subject-specific ""microstates"" within
canonical sleep stages, and 3) discovery of stage-dependent sub-oscillations
with shared spectral signatures across subjects.

longitudinal measurements of an insurance risk. Assessing the association among

  Motivated by insurance applications, we propose a general framework for

different types of data, including continuous, discrete, as well as mixed

separately modeled using pair copula constructions with a D-vine structure. The
multiple D-vines are then joined by a multivariate copula. A sequential
approach is employed for inference and its performance is investigated under a

  In the empirical analysis, we examine property risks in a government

provides an exploration of this philosophy. On the one hand, I will show how
astrophysical observations of dark matter, through its gravitational
interaction, can be exploited to determine the most promising locations on the
sky to observe a particle dark matter signal. On the other, I demonstrate that
refined theoretical calculations of the expected dark matter interactions can
be used disentangle signals from astrophysical backgrounds. Both of these

applied to the case of an excess of photons observed at the center of the Milky
Way. This galactic center excess represents both the challenges and joys of
indirect detection. Initially thought to be a signal of annihilating dark
matter at the center of our own galaxy, it now appears more likely to be
associated with a population of millisecond pulsars. Yet these pulsars were
completely unanticipated, and highlight that indirect detection can lead to
many new insights about the universe, hopefully one day including the particle

from insulating states believed to arise from electronic correlations. While
there have been many proposals to explain the insulating behaviour, the

insulators. Here we focus on the insulating states with $\pm 2$ electrons or
holes with respect to the charge neutrality point. We show that the theoretical
expectations for the Mott insulating states are not compatible with the
experimentally observed dependence on temperature and magnetic field if, as
frequently assumed, only the correlations between electrons on the same site
are included. We argue that the inclusion of non-local (inter-site)
correlations in the treatment of the Hubbard model can bring the predictions
for the magnetic and temperature dependencies of the Mott transition to an
agreement with experiments and have consequences for the critical interactions,
the size of the gap, and possible pseudogap physics. The importance of the
inter-site correlations to explain the experimental observations indicates that
the observed insulating gap is not the one between the Hubbard bands and that
antiferromagnetic-like correlations play a key role in the Mott transition.

assumptions for the degradation of stored elastic energy due to fracture are
crucial to preventing cracking in compression and obtaining physically sound

volumetric-deviatoric split, and their effects on the performance of the
phase-field modeling are studied. Meanwhile, anisotropic degradation of

violates crack boundary conditions and can cause unphysical crack openings and
propagation. A simple yet effective treatment for this is proposed: define a
critically damaged zone with a threshold parameter and then degrade both the
active and passive energies in the zone. A dynamic mesh adaptation finite

nontrivial finite normal subgroups. Then $H$ is verbally closed in $G$ if and
only if $H$ is a retract of $G$. The condition that $G$ is finitely presented
and $H$ is finitely generated can be replaced by the condition that $G$ is
finitely generated over $H$ and $H$ is equationally Noetherian. As a corollary,
we solve Problem 5.2 from the paper arXiv:1201.0497v2 of Miasnikov and

(IR) wavelengths. We estimate the expected numbers of CE ejection events and
HMXBs per star formation unit rate, and compare these theoretical estimates
with observations. We compiled a list of 85 mid-IR transients of uncertain
nature detected by the Spitzer Infrared Intensive Transients Survey and
searched for their associations with X-ray, optical, and UV sources. Confirming
our theoretical estimates, we find that only one potential HMXB may be
plausibly associated with an IR-transient and tentatively propose that X-ray
source NGC 4490-X40 could be a precursor to the SPIRITS 16az event. Among other
interesting sources, we suggest that the supernova remnant candidate [BWL2012]
063 might be associated with SPIRITS 16ajc. We also find that two SPIRITS

The cost of solving an adjoint equation is comparable to the cost of solving
the governing equation. Once the adjoint solution is obtained, the
sensitivities to any number of parameters can be obtained with little effort.
There are two methods to develop the adjoint equations: continuous method and
discrete method. In the continuous method, the control theory is applied to the
forward governing equation and produces an analytical partial differential
equation for solving the adjoint variable; in the discrete method, the control
theory is applied to the discrete form of the forward governing equation and
produces a linear system of equations for solving the adjoint variable. In this
article, an adjoint sensitivity analysis framework is developed using both the
continuous and discrete methods. These two methods are assessed with the faucet
flow for steady-state problem and one transient test case based on the BFBT
benchmark for transient problem. Adjoint sensitivities from both methods are
verified by sensitivities given by the perturbation method. Adjoint
sensitivities from both methods are physically reasonable and match each. The
sensitivities obtained with discrete method is found to be more accurate than
the sensitivities from the continuous method. The continuous method is
computationally more efficient than the discrete method because of the
analytical coefficient matrices and vectors. However, difficulties are observed
in solving the continuous adjoint equation for cases where the adjoint equation
contains sharp discontinuities in the source terms; in such cases, the
continuous method is not as robust as the discrete adjoint method.

runtime megamodels, which are specific runtime models that have themselves
runtime models as their elements and that also capture the relationships
between multiple runtime models, have been proposed. In this paper, we go one
step further and present a modeling language for runtime megamodels that
considerably eases the development of the adaptation logic by providing a
domain-specific modeling approach and a runtime interpreter for this part of a
self-adaptive system. This supports development by modeling the feedback loops
explicitly and at a higher level of abstraction. Moreover, it permits to build
complex solutions where multiple feedback loops interact or operate on top of
each other, which is leveraged by keeping the megamodels explicit and alive at
runtime and by interpreting them.

typical MDE techniques, like model transformation, or well-known techniques,
like event-condition-action rules, from other fields than MDE to realize a
feedback loop. However, elaborating requirements for feedback loop activities
for the specific case of runtime models is rather neglected. Therefore, we
investigate requirements for Adaptation Models that specify the analysis,
decision-making, and planning of adaptation as part of a feedback loop. In
particular, we consider requirements for a modeling language of adaptation
models and for a framework as the execution environment of adaptation models.
Moreover, we discuss patterns for using adaptation models within the feedback

surface. Release of greenhouse gas molecules from the surface of melting ice
can potentially influence climate greenhouse effects.

the Hamiltonian approach in Coulomb gauge. Finite temperature T is introduced
by compactifying one spatial dimension, which makes all thermodynamical
quantities accessible from the ground state on the spatial manifold
$\small\mathbb{R}^2 \times S^1(1/T)$. Neglecting the coupling between quarks
and transversal gluons, the equations of motion of the quark sector are solved
numerically and the chiral quark condensate is evaluated and compared to the
results of the usual canonical approach to finite-temperature Hamiltonian QCD
based on the density operator of the grand canonical ensemble. For zero bare
quark masses, we find a second-order chiral phase transition with a critical
temperature of about 92 MeV. If the Coulomb string tension is adjusted to
reproduce the phenomenological value of the quark condensate, the critical
temperature increases to 118 MeV.

we highlight the possible advantages of applying this approach to the problem
of designing complex artificial agents, along with the potential drawbacks and
issues to be addressed in the future.
