  the presence of missing predictor data using multiple imputation: theoretical
  perspective and data-based evaluation","This paper is under review at Biometrical Journal",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the problem of calibration and assessment of predictive rules
in prognostic designs when missing values are present in the predictors. Our
paper has two key objectives which are entwined. The first is to investigate
how the calibration of the prediction rule can be combined with the use of
multiple imputation to account for missing predictor observations. The second
objective is to propose such methods that can be implemented with current
multiple imputation software, while allowing for unbiased predictive assessment
through validation on new observations for which outcome is not yet available.
  To inform the definition of methodology, we commence with a review of the
theoretical background of multiple imputation as a model estimation approach as
opposed to a purely algorithmic description. We specifically contrast
application of multiple imputation for parameter (effect) estimation with
predictive calibration. Based on this review, two approaches are formulated, of
which the second utilizes application of the classical Rubin's rules for
parameter estimation, while the first approach averages probabilities from
models fitted on single imputations to directly approximate the predictive
density for future observations. We present implementations using current
software which allow for validatory or cross-validatory estimation of
performance measures, as well as imputation of missing data in predictors on
the future data where outcome is by definition as yet unobserved.
  We restrict discussion to binary outcome and logistic regression throughout,
though the principles discussed are generally applicable. We present two data
sets as examples from our regular consultative practice. Results show little
difference between methods for accuracy but substantial reductions in variation
of calibrated probabilities when using the first approach.

wide applications, such as accelerating information diffusion or halting virus
spreading. Many measures based on the network topology have emerged over the
years to identify influential nodes such as Betweenness, Closeness, and
Eigenvalue centrality. However, although most real-world networks are modular,
few measures exploit this property. Recent works have shown that it has a
significant effect on the dynamics on networks. In a modular network, a node
has two types of influence: a local influence (on the nodes of its community)
through its intra-community links and a global influence (on the nodes in other
communities) through its inter-community links. Depending of the strength of
the community structure, these two components are more or less influential.
Based on this idea, we propose to extend all the standard centrality measures
defined for networks with no community structure to modular networks. The
so-called ""Modular centrality"" is a two dimensional vector. Its first component
quantifies the local influence of a node in its community while the second
component quantifies its global influence on the other communities of the
network. In order to illustrate the effectiveness of the Modular centrality
extensions, comparison with their scalar counterpart are performed in an
epidemic process setting. Simulation results using the
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model on synthetic networks with
controlled community structure allows getting a clear idea about the relation
between the strength of the community structure and the major type of influence
(global/local). Furthermore, experiments on real-world networks demonstrate the
merit of this approach.

characteristics unique to Andreev blockade. Most significantly, it occurs for
any occupation of the dot adjacent to the superconductor, in contrast with the
well-studied Pauli blockade which requires odd occupations. Andreev blockade is
lifted if quasiparticles are allowed to enter the superconducting lead, but it
should be observable in the hard gap superconductor-semiconductor devices. A

($L^2$-critical) focusing Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) equation blow-up in finite or
infinite time. The proof consists of several steps. First, we show that if the
blow-up conclusion is false, there are negative energy solutions arbitrarily
close to the threshold that are globally bounded in $H^1$ and are spatially
localized, uniformly in time. In the second step, we show that such solutions
must in fact be exact remodulations of the ground state, and hence, have zero
energy, which is a contradiction. This second step, a nonlinear Liouville
theorem, is proved by contradiction, with a limiting argument producing a
nontrivial solution to a (linear) linearized ZK equation obeying
uniform-in-time spatial localization. Such nontrivial linear solutions are
excluded by a local-viral space-time estimate. The general framework of the
argument is modeled on Merle [29] and Martel & Merle [24], who treated the 1D
problem of the $L^2$-critical gKdV equation. Several new features are
introduced here to handle the 2D ZK case.

of von Neumann measurements in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Specifically,
we consider two scenarios: minimum error and unambiguous discrimination. In the
case of minimum error discrimination, we focus on discrimination of
measurements with the assistance of entanglement. We provide an alternative
proof of the fact that all pairs of distinct von Neumann measurements can be
distinguished perfectly (i.e. with the unit success probability) using only a
finite number of queries. Moreover, we analytically find the minimal number of
queries needed for perfect discrimination. We also show that in this scenario
querying the measurements gives the optimal strategy, and hence any possible
adaptive methods do not offer any advantage over the parallel scheme. In the
unambiguous discrimination scenario, we give the general expressions for the
optimal discrimination probabilities with and without the assistance of
entanglement. Finally, we show that typical pairs of Haar-random von Neumann
measurements can be perfectly distinguished with only two queries.

the pair correlation function perpendicular to the substrate modulation and the
mean squared displacement (MSD) of dust particles are calculated. It is found
that both the structure and dynamics of 2DDP exhibit strong anisotropic
effects, due to the applied 1DPS. As the substrate strength increases from 0,
the structure order of dusty plasma along each potential well of 1DPS increases
first probably due to the competition between the inter-particle interactions
and the particle-substrate interactions, and then decreases gradually, which
may be due to the reduced dimensionality and the enhanced fluctuations. The
obtained MSD along potential wells of 1DPS clearly shows three processes of
diffusion in our studied 2DDP. Between the initial ballistic and finally
diffusive motion, there is the intermediate sub-diffusion discovered here,
which may result from the substrate-induced distortion of the caging dynamics.

shallow crust, supporting life, stimulating substrate transformation, and
spurring evolutionary innovation. While oxidative processes have dominated half
of terrestrial history, the relative contribution of the biosphere and its
chemical fingerprints on Earth's developing regolith are still poorly
constrained. Here, we report results from a two-year incipient weathering
experiment. We found that the mass release and compartmentalization of major
elements during weathering of granite, rhyolite, schist and basalt was
rock-specific and regulated by ecosystem components.
  A tight interplay between physiological needs of different biota, mineral
dissolution rates, and substrate nutrient availability resulted in intricate
elemental distribution patterns. Biota accelerated CO2 mineralization over
abiotic controls as ecosystem complexity increased, and significantly modified
stoichiometry of mobilized elements. Microbial and fungal components inhibited
element leaching (23.4% and 7%), while plants increased leaching and biomass
retention by 63.4%. All biota left comparable biosignatures in the dissolved
weathering products. Nevertheless, the magnitude and allocation of weathered
fractions under abiotic and biotic treatments provide quantitative evidence for
the role of major biosphere components in the evolution of upper continental
crust, presenting critical information for large-scale biogeochemical models
and for the search for stable in situ biosignatures beyond Earth.

so-called \emph{continuous random energy model (CREM)}, introduced by Bovier
and Kurkova in 2004 as an extension of Derrida's \emph{generalized random
energy model}. The CREM is a model of a random energy landscape $(X_v)_{v \in
\{0,1\}^N}$ on the discrete hypercube with built-in hierarchical structure, and
can be regarded as a toy model for strongly correlated random energy landscapes
such as the family of $p$-spin models including the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick
model. The CREM is parameterized by an increasing function $A:[0,1]\to[0,1]$,
which encodes the correlations between states.
  We exhibit an \emph{algorithmic hardness threshold} $x_*$, which is explicit
in terms of $A$. More precisely, we obtain two results: First, we show that a
renormalization procedure combined with a greedy search yields for any
$\varepsilon > 0$ a linear-time algorithm which finds states $v \in \{0,1\}^N$
with $X_v \ge (x_*-\varepsilon) N$. Second, we show that the value $x_*$ is
essentially best-possible: for any $\varepsilon > 0$, any algorithm which finds
states $v$ with $X_v \ge (x_*+\varepsilon)N$ requires exponentially many
queries in expectation and with high probability. We further discuss what
insights this study yields for understanding algorithmic hardness thresholds
for random instances of combinatorial optimization problems.

element methods for the classical Kolmogorov's equation. Kolmogorov's equation
serves as a sufficiently rich, for our purposes, model problem for kinetic-type
equations and is characterised by diffusion in one of the two (or three)
spatial directions only. Nonetheless, its solution admits typically decay
properties to some long time equilibrium, depending on closure by suitable
boundary/decay-at-infinity conditions. A key attribute of the proposed family
of methods is that they also admit similar decay properties at the
(semi)discrete level for very general families of triangulations. The method
construction uses ideas by the general theory of hypocoercivity developed by
Villani [23], along with judicious choice of numerical flux functions. These
developments turn out to be sufficient to imply that the proposed finite
element methods admit a priori error bounds with constants independent of the
final time, despite Kolmogorov equation's degenerate diffusion nature. Thus,
the new methods provably allow for robust error analysis for final times
tending to infinity. The extension to three spatial dimensions is also briefly

higher overall insolations. Because of weathering's integral role in the
long-term carbonate-silicate cycle, we suggest that climate stability may be
strongly affected by the anticipated rotational evolution of temperate
terrestrial-type worlds, and should be considered a major factor in their
study. In light of our results we argue that planetary rotation period is an
important factor to consider when determining the habitability of terrestrial
worlds.

significantly altered the Earth's atmosphere by contributing to the rise of
oxygen ~2.3 billion years ago. However, photosynthetic chlorophyll and
bacteriochlorophyll pigments lack appreciable absorption at wavelengths about

the thermodynamic entropy, in qualitative agreement with holographic complexity
proposals. For TFD states at t > 0, we demonstrate that the complexity evolves
in time and saturates after a time of the order of the inverse temperature. The
latter feature, which is in contrast with the results of holographic proposals,
is due to the Gaussian nature of the TFD state of the free bosonic QFT. A novel
technical aspect of our work is framing complexity calculations in the language

provide a natural language for dealing with Gaussian states. Furthermore, for
free QFTs in 1+1 dimension, we compare the dynamics of circuit complexity with
the time dependence of the entanglement entropy for simple bipartitions of
TFDs. We relate our results for the entanglement entropy to previous studies on
non-equilibrium entanglement evolution following quenches. We also present a

fluid flow within it, even at vanishing Reynolds number (no fluid inertia).
Deformation leads to an enhancement of throughput due to the change in
cross-sectional area. The latter gives rise to a non-constant pressure gradient
in the flow-wise direction and, hence, to a nonlinear flow rate--pressure drop
relation (unlike the Hagen--Poiseuille law for a rigid tube). Many biofluids
are non-Newtonian, and are well approximated by generalized Newtonian (say,
power-law) rheological models. Consequently, we analyze the problem of steady
low Reynolds number flow of a generalized Newtonian fluid through a slender
elastic tube by coupling fluid lubrication theory to a structural problem posed
in terms of Donnell shell theory. A perturbative approach (in the slenderness
parameter) yields analytical solutions for both the flow and the deformation.
Using matched asymptotics, we obtain a uniformly valid solution for the tube's
radial displacement, which features both a boundary layer and a corner layer
caused by localized bending near the clamped ends. In doing so, we obtain a
``generalized Hagen--Poiseuille law'' for soft microtubes. We benchmark the
mathematical predictions against three-dimensional two-way coupled direct
numerical simulations (DNS) of flow and deformation performed using the

good agreement and establish the range of validity of the theory. Finally, we

important, but state-of-the-art techniques assume that the human's desired
objective lies within the robot's hypothesis space. When this is not true, even
methods that keep track of uncertainty over the objective fail because they
reason about which hypothesis might be correct, and not whether any of the
hypotheses are correct. We focus specifically on learning from physical human
corrections during the robot's task execution, where not having a rich enough
hypothesis space leads to the robot updating its objective in ways that the
person did not actually intend. We observe that such corrections appear
irrelevant to the robot, because they are not the best way of achieving any of
the candidate objectives. Instead of naively trusting and learning from every
human interaction, we propose robots learn conservatively by reasoning in real
time about how relevant the human's correction is for the robot's hypothesis
space. We test our inference method in an experiment with human interaction
data, and demonstrate that this alleviates unintended learning in an in-person
user study with a 7DoF robot manipulator.

tasks, other learning problems may have different properties. For instance,
semantic segmentation requires additional components such as dilated
convolutions and multiscale processing. In this paper, we aim to characterize
adversarial examples based on spatial context information in semantic
segmentation. We observe that spatial consistency information can be
potentially leveraged to detect adversarial examples robustly even when a
strong adaptive attacker has access to the model and detection strategies. We
also show that adversarial examples based on attacks considered within the

planetesimals in protoplanetary disks. To trigger this process, it has been
argued that sedimentation of solids onto the mid-plane needs to be efficient
and therefore that a quiescent gaseous environment is required. It is often
suggested that dead-zone or disk-wind structure created by non-ideal
magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) effects meets this requirement. However,
simulations have shown that the midplane of a dead zone is not completely
quiescent. In order to examine the concentration of solids in such an
environment, we use the local-shearing-box approximation to simulate a
particle-gas system with an Ohmic dead zone including mutual drag force between
the gas and the solids. We systematically compare the evolution of the system
with ideal or non-ideal MHD, with or without back-reaction drag force from
particles on gas, and with varying solid abundances. Similar to previous
investigations of dead zone dynamics, we find that particles of dimensionless
stopping time $\tau_s=0.1$ do not sediment appreciably more than those in ideal
magneto-rotational turbulence, resulting in a vertical scale height an order of
magnitude larger than in a laminar disk. Contrary to the expectation that this
should curb the formation of planetesimals, we nevertheless find that strong
clumping of solids still occurs in the dead zone when solid abundances are
similar to the critical value for a laminar environment. This can be explained
by the weak radial diffusion of particles near the mid-plane. The results imply
that the sedimentation of particles to the mid-plane is not a necessary
criterion for the formation of planetesimals by the streaming instability.

(distribution-function (DF)-based models, Jeans models, and a grid of N-body

data for GCs: surface brightness or number density profiles, local stellar mass
functions, line-of-sight velocities, and Hubble Space Telescope- and Gaia-like
proper motions. We discuss the successes and limitations of the methods. We
find that multimass DF-based models, Jeans, and N-body models provide more
accurate mass profiles compared to single-mass DF-based models. We highlight
complications in fitting the kinematics in the outskirts due to energetically
unbound stars associated with the cluster (""potential escapers"", not captured
by truncated DF models nor by N-body models of clusters in isolation), which
can be avoided with DF-based models including potential escapers, or with Jeans
models. We discuss ways to account for mass segregation. For example,
three-component DF-based models with freedom in their mass function are a
simple alternative to avoid the biases of single-mass models (which
systematically underestimate the total mass, half-mass radius, and central
density), while more realistic multimass DF-based models with freedom in the
remnant content represent a promising avenue to infer the total mass and the
mass function of remnants.

the width of the the dark matter decay line for Perseus-analogue galaxy
clusters lies in the range 1300-1700~\kms. Therefore, the non-detection of the

First, the extremality condition of a charged black hole is modified, and
second, the test particles required to satisfy the Weak Gravity Conjecture are
subject to additional Yukawa type interactions. We argue on general grounds
that at weak coupling, the two types of effects are equivalent for a tower of
asymptotically massless charged test particles predicted by the Swampland
Distance Conjecture. We then specialise to F-theory compactified on elliptic
Calabi-Yau three-folds and prove that the precise numerical bound on the

intriguing coincidence of two a priori different notions of extremality, namely
one based on the balance of gauge, gravitational and scalar forces for extremal
(non-BPS) black holes, and the other encoded in the modular properties of
certain Jacobi forms. In the presence of multiple abelian gauge group factors,
the elliptic genus counting these states is a lattice quasi-Jacobi form of
higher rank, and we exemplify this in a model with two abelian gauge group
factors.

Hill sphere filling debris ring system around a secondary companion, J1407b. No
other eclipses have since been detected, although other measurements have
constrained but not uniquely determined the orbital period of J1407b. Finding
another eclipse towards J1407 will help determine the orbital period of the
system, the geometry of the proposed ring system and enable planning of further
observations to characterize the material within these putative rings. Aims. We
carry out a search for other eclipses in photometric data of J1407 with the aim
of constraining the orbital period of J1407b. Methods. We present photometry
from archival photographic plates from the Harvard DASCH survey, and Bamberg
and Sonneberg Observatories, in order to place additional constraints on the
orbital period of J1407b by searching for other dimming and eclipse events.
Using a visual inspection of all 387 plates and a period-folding algorithm we
performed a search for other eclipses in these data sets. Results. We find no
other deep eclipses in the data spanning from 1890 to 1990, nor in recent
time-series photometry from 2012-2018. Conclusions. We rule out a large
fraction of putative orbital periods for J1407b from 5 to 20 years. These
limits are still marginally consistent with a large Hill sphere filling ring
system surrounding a brown dwarf companion in a bound elliptical orbit about
J1407. Issues with the stability of any rings combined with the lack of
detection of another eclipse, suggests that J1407b may not be bound to J1407.

follow the physical processes responsible for the growth of bulges via disc
instabilities (leading to pseudo-bulges) and mergers (leading to classical
bulges). We address the former by considering the contribution of both stellar
and gaseous discs in the stability of the galaxy, and we update the latter by
including dissipation of energy in gas-rich mergers. Furthermore, we introduce
angular momentum losses during cooling and find that an accurate match to the
observed correlation between stellar disc scale length and mass at z ~ 0.0
requires that the gas loses 20% of its initial specific angular momentum to the
corresponding dark matter halo during the formation of the cold gas disc. We
reproduce the observed trends between the stellar mass and specific angular
momentum for both disc- and bulge-dominated galaxies, with the former rotating
faster than the latter of the same mass. We conclude that a two-component
instability recipe provides a morphologically diverse galaxy sample which
matches the observed fractional breakdown of galaxies into different
morphological types. This recipe also enables us to obtain an excellent fit to
the morphology-mass relation and stellar mass function of different galactic
types. Finally, we find that energy dissipation during mergers reduces the
merger remnant sizes and allows us to match the observed mass-size relation for
bulge-dominated systems.

during which the birth of the first stars and galaxies led to the ionization of
neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium. There are many experiments
investigating the EoR by tracing the 21cm line of neutral hydrogen. Because
this signal is very faint and difficult to isolate, it is crucial to develop
analysis techniques that maximize sensitivity and suppress contaminants in
data. It is also imperative to understand the trade-offs between different
analysis methods and their effects on power spectrum estimates. Specifically,
with a statistical power spectrum detection in HERA's foreseeable future, it
has become increasingly important to understand how certain analysis choices
can lead to the loss of the EoR signal. In this paper, we focus on signal loss
associated with power spectrum estimation. We describe the origin of this loss
using both toy models and data taken by the 64-element configuration of the
Donald C. Backer Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER).
In particular, we highlight how detailed investigations of signal loss have led
to a revised, higher 21cm power spectrum upper limit from PAPER-64.
Additionally, we summarize errors associated with power spectrum error
estimation that were previously unaccounted for. We focus on a subset of
PAPER-64 data in this paper; revised power spectrum limits from the PAPER
experiment are presented in a forthcoming paper by Kolopanis et al. (in prep.)
and supersede results from previously published PAPER analyses.

correlated with cold rather than with warm dust emission, suggesting that PAHs
are associated with the diffuse cold dust, which is another proxy for $M_{\rm

emission to derive $M_{\rm H_2}$ estimates and find a constant $M_{\rm

theories of gravity. While the RSD on small scales (e.g. a few to tens of
$h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$) can further tighten the $f\sigma_8$ constraints, galaxy
assembly bias, if not correctly modelled, may introduce systematic
uncertainties. Using a mock galaxy catalogue with built-in assembly bias, we
perform a preliminary study on how assembly bias may affect the $f\sigma_8$

between a $f\sigma_8$ metric from the redshift-space two-point correlation
function with the central-only mock catalogue and that with the shuffled
catalogue free of assembly bias, implying that $f\sigma_8$ information can be
extracted on such scales even with assembly bias. We then apply the halo
occupation distribution (HOD) and three subhalo clustering and abundance
matching (SCAM) models to model the redshift-space clustering with the mock.
Only the SCAM model based on $V_{\rm peak}$ (used to create the mock) can
reproduce the $f\sigma_8$ metric, and the other three could not. However, the
$f\sigma_8$ metrics determined from central galaxies from all the models are
able to match the expected one down to 8$h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$. Our results suggest
that halo models with no or incorrect assembly bias prescription could still be
used to model the RSD down to scales of $\sim 8 h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ to tighten the
$f\sigma_8$ constraint, with a sample of central galaxies or with a flexible
satellite occupation prescription.

test the proposed changes via simulating the application of the new annotation

learning models trained on datasets annotated with initial and simulated
guidelines. While the overall performance of automatic app feature extraction
remains the same as compared to the model trained on the dataset with initial
annotations, the features extracted by the model trained on the dataset with
simulated new annotations are less noisy and more informative to the app
developers. Secondly, we are interested in what kind of annotated training data
is necessary for training an automatic app feature extraction model. In
particular, we explore whether the training set should contain annotated app
reviews from those apps/app categories on which the model is subsequently
planned to be applied, or is it sufficient to have annotated app reviews from
any app available for training, even when these apps are from very different
categories compared to the test app. Our experiments show that having annotated
training reviews from the test app is not necessary although including them
into training set helps to improve recall. Furthermore, we test whether
augmenting the training set with annotated product reviews helps to improve the
performance of app feature extraction. We find that the models trained on

In this paper, we study the general $(p,q)$-case. Our main result is to
establish the following transition:
  $\bullet$ If $p\geqslant 2q$, then Maker wins the game on arbitrarily long
versions of the narrowest board possible, i.e. Maker has a winning strategy for
the $(2q, q)$-crossing game on $\Lambda_{m \times(q+1)}$ for any $m\in

  $\bullet$ if $p\leqslant 2q-1$, then for every width $n$ of the board,
Breaker has a winning strategy for the $(p,q)$-crossing game on $\Lambda_{m

  Our winning strategies in both cases adapt more generally to other grids and
crossing games. In addition we pose many new questions and problems.

gradients in a liquid binary mixture around a spherical bubble undergoing
volume oscillations in a sound field. Assuming the impermeability of the bubble
wall to both species, diffusion driven by pressure gradients and classical
Fick-diffusion must cancel at the bubble wall, so that an oscillatory
concentration gradient arises in the vicinity of the bubble. The Peclet number
Pe is generally high in typical situations and Fick diffusion cannot restore
equilibrium immediately, so that an asymptotic average concentration profile
may progressively build up in the liquid over large times. Such a behavior is
reminiscent of the so-called rectified diffusion problem, leading to slow
growth of gas bubble oscillating in a sound field. A rigorous method formerly
proposed by Fyrillas & Szeri (1994) to solve the latter problem is used in this
paper to solve the present one. It is based on splitting the problem into a
smooth part and an oscillatory part. [...] For driving pressures sufficiently
high to yield inertial oscillations of the bubble, the oscillatory problem
predicts a periodic peak excess concentration of the heaviest species at the
bubble wall at each collapse, lingering on several tens of time the
characteristic duration of the bubble rebound. The two effects may compete for
large molecules and practical implications of this segregation phenomenon are
proposed for various processes involving acoustic cavitation.

all human cells - the fundamental units of life - as a basis for understanding
fundamental human biological processes and diagnosing, monitoring, and treating
disease. It will help scientists understand how genetic variants impact disease
risk, define drug toxicities, discover better therapies, and advance
regenerative medicine. A resource of such ambition and scale should be built in
stages, increasing in size, breadth, and resolution as technologies develop and
understanding deepens. We will therefore pursue Phase 1 as a suite of flagship
projects in key tissues, systems, and organs. We will bring together experts in
biology, medicine, genomics, technology development and computation (including
data analysis, software engineering, and visualization). We will also need
standardized experimental and computational methods that will allow us to
compare diverse cell and tissue types - and samples across human communities -
in consistent ways, ensuring that the resulting resource is truly global.
  This document, the first version of the HCA White Paper, was written by
experts in the field with feedback and suggestions from the HCA community,
gathered during recent international meetings. The White Paper, released at the
close of this yearlong planning process, will be a living document that evolves
as the HCA community provides additional feedback, as technological and
computational advances are made, and as lessons are learned during the
construction of the atlas.

observables to the parameters of the underlying model and hence universal
predictions with respect to at least some microphysical considerations. We also
find other intriguing behaviour, such as sharp transitions in the predictions
when certain hyperparameters cross a critical value. We develop a robust
numerical approach to studying these behaviours by adapting methods often seen
in the context of machine learning. We first test our approach by applying it
to well known examples of universality, sharp transitions, and concentration
phenomena in random matrix theory. We then apply the method to inflation with

transport materials will benefit from mechanistic understanding of how oxygen
transports through these materials. Using Density Functional Theory, we found
there are two distinct oxygen interstitial diffusion mechanisms involving two
different oxygen interstitial species that can be active in La2-xSrxNiO4+delta,
and, we believe, in hyperstoichiometric RP oxides in general. The first
mechanism is the previously proposed interstitialcy-mediated mechanism, which
consists of diffusing oxide interstitials. The second mechanism is newly
discovered in this work, and consists of both oxide and peroxide interstitial
species. This mechanism exhibits a similar or possibly lower migration barrier
than the interstitialcy mechanism for high oxidation states. Which mechanism
contributes to the oxygen interstitial diffusion is the result of the change in
relative stability between the oxide interstitial and peroxide interstitial.
The stability of the oxide and peroxide, and the competition between the two
oxygen diffusion mechanisms, is sensitive to the overall oxidation state of the
system. Therefore, the oxygen diffusion mechanism is a function of the material
composition, oxygen off-stoichiometry, operating temperature and oxygen partial
pressure. We also examined the effect of epitaxial strain on both oxygen
diffusion mechanisms, and found that tensile and compressive epitaxial strain
of up to 2% had less than 100 meV/(% strain) effects on oxygen interstitial
formation, migration, and activation energies, and that total achievable
activation energy reductions are likely less than 100 meV for -2% to +2%
epitaxial strain. The presented understanding of factors governing interstitial
oxygen diffusion has significant implications for the engineering of RP oxides
in numerous alternative energy technologies.

strength of haze scattering. We connect recent laboratory results of particle
size and production rate for exoplanet hazes to a one-dimensional atmospheric
model for TRAPPIST-1 transmission spectra. Doing so, we obtain a
physically-based estimate of haze scattering cross sections. We find haze
scattering cross sections on the order of 1e-26 to 1e-19 cm squared are needed
in hydrogen-rich atmospheres for TRAPPIST-1 d, e, and f to match the HST data.
For TRAPPIST-1 g, we cannot rule out a clear hydrogen-rich atmosphere. We also
modeled the effects an opaque cloud deck and substantial heavy element content
have on the transmission spectra. We determine that hydrogen-rich atmospheres
with high altitude clouds, at pressures of 12mbar and lower, are consistent
with the HST observations for TRAPPIST-1 d and e. For TRAPPIST-1 f and g, we

extended network of voids delimited by sheets, themselves segmented by
filaments, within which matter flows towards compact nodes where they
intersect, imprints its geometry on the dynamics of cosmic flows, ultimately
shaping the distribution of galaxies and the redshift evolution of their
properties. The (filament-type) saddle points of this cosmic web provide a
local frame in which to quantify the induced physical and morphological
evolution of galaxies on large scales. The properties of virtual galaxies
within the Horizon-AGN simulation are stacked in such a frame. The iso-contours
of the galactic number density, mass, specific star formation rate (sSFR),
kinematics and age are clearly aligned with the filament axis with steep
gradients perpendicular to the filaments. A comparison to a simulation without
feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) illustrates its impact on quenching
star formation of centrals away from the saddles. The redshift evolution of the
properties of galaxies and their age distribution are consistent with the
geometry of the bulk flow within that frame. They compare well with
expectations from constrained Gaussian random fields and the scaling with the
mass of non-linearity, modulo the redshift dependent impact of feedback
processes. Physical properties such as sSFR and kinematics seem not to depend
only on mean halo mass and density: the residuals trace the geometry of the
saddle, which could point to other environment-sensitive physical processes,
such as spin advection, and AGN feedback at high mass.

  Uncertainty Approach",,,"10.1109/TPWRS.2020.2979118",,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) approach for the
transmission expansion planning problem, considering both long- and short-term
uncertainties on the system demand and non-dispatchable renewable generation.
On the long-term level, as is customary in industry applications, we address
the deep uncertainties arising from social and economic transformations,
political and environmental issues, and technology disruptions by using
long-term scenarios devised by experts. In this setting, many exogenous
long-term scenarios containing partial information about the random parameters,
namely, the average and the support set, can be considered. For each long-term
scenario, a conditional ambiguity set models the incomplete knowledge about the
probability distribution of the uncertain parameters in the short-term
operation. Consequently, the mathematical problem is formulated as a DRO model
with multiple conditional ambiguity sets. The resulting infinite-dimensional
problem is recast as an exact, although very large, finite mixed-integer linear
programming problem. To circumvent scalability issues, we propose a new
enhanced-column-and-constraint-generation (ECCG) decomposition approach with an
additional Dantzig--Wolfe procedure. In comparison to existing methods, ECCG
leads to a better representation of the recourse function and, consequently,
tighter bounds. Numerical experiments based on the benchmark IEEE 118-bus
system are reported to corroborate the effectiveness of the method.

systematic simulation campaigns of turbulent channel flow. The effect of wall
model, grid resolution and anisotropy, numerical convective scheme and
subgrid-scale modeling is investigated. All of these factors affect the
resulting accuracy, and their action is to a large extent intertwined. The wall
model is of the wall-stress type, and its sensitivity to location of velocity
sampling, as well as law of the wall's parameters is assessed. For efficient
exploration of the model parameter space (anisotropic grid resolution and wall
model parameter values), generalized polynomial chaos expansions are used to
construct metamodels for the responses which are taken to be measures of the
predictive error in quantities of interest (QoIs). The QoIs include the mean
wall shear stress and profiles of the mean velocity, the turbulent kinetic
energy, and the Reynolds shear stress. DNS data is used as reference. Within
the tested framework, a particular second-order accurate CFD code (OpenFOAM),
the results provide ample support for grid and method parameters
recommendations which are proposed in the present paper, and which provide good
results for the QoIs. Notably, good results are obtained with a grid with
isotropic (cubic) hexahedral cells, with $15\, 000$ cells per $\delta^3$, where
$\delta$ is the channel half-height (or thickness of the turbulent boundary
layer). The importance of providing enough numerical dissipation to obtain
accurate QoIs is demonstrated. The main channel flow case investigated is ${\rm
Re}_\tau=5200$, but extension to a wide range of ${\rm Re}$-numbers is
considered. Use of other numerical methods and software would likely modify
these recommendations, at least slightly, but the proposed framework is fully
applicable to investigate this as well.

which tightens to $r_{0.05}<0.06$ in conjunction with Planck temperature
measurements and other data. The lensing signal is detected at $8.8 \sigma$

interpolation technique for stochastic reach sets. Utilizing convex
optimization, we propose a scalable and grid-free algorithm that computes a
polytopic underapproximation of the stochastic reach set and synthesizes an

characterized by the point at which they enter or exit the celestial sphere as
well as their $SL(2,\mathbb C)$ Lorentz quantum numbers: namely their conformal
scaling dimension and spin $h\pm \bar h$ instead of the energy and momentum.
This characterization precludes the notion of a soft particle whose energy is
taken to zero. We propose it should be replaced by the notion of a conformally
soft particle with $h=0$ or $\bar h=0$. For photons we explicitly construct
conformally soft $SL(2,\mathbb C)$ currents with dimensions $(1,0)$ and
identify them with the generator of a $U(1)$ Kac-Moody symmetry on the
celestial sphere. For gravity the generator of celestial conformal symmetry is
constructed from a $(2,0)$ $SL(2,\mathbb C)$ primary wavefunction.
Interestingly, BMS supertranslations are generated by a spin-one weight
$(\frac{3}{2},\frac{1}{2})$ operator, which nevertheless shares holomorphic
characteristics of a conformally soft operator. This is because the right hand
side of its OPE with a weight $(h,\bar h)$ operator ${\cal O}_{h,\bar h}$
involves the shifted operator ${\cal O}_{h+\frac{1}{2},\bar h+ \frac{1}{2}}$.
This OPE relation looks quite unusual from the celestial CFT$_2$ perspective
but is equivalent to the leading soft graviton theorem and may usefully
constrain celestial correlators in quantum gravity.

due to the difficulty of obtaining anomalous samples for training and the need
to obtain a sufficient amount of training data. In recent years, autoencoders
have been shown to be effective anomaly detectors that train only on ""normal""

additional training samples for classifiers, thus making them more accurate and
robust. However, in anomaly detection GANs are only used to reconstruct
existing samples rather than to generate additional ones. This stems both from
the small amount and lack of diversity of anomalous data in most domains. In
this study we propose MDGAN, a novel GAN architecture for improving anomaly
detection through the generation of additional samples. Our approach uses two
discriminators: a dense network for determining whether the generated samples
are of sufficient quality (i.e., valid) and an autoencoder that serves as an
anomaly detector. MDGAN enables us to reconcile two conflicting goals: 1)
generate high-quality samples that can fool the first discriminator, and 2)
generate samples that can eventually be effectively reconstructed by the second
discriminator, thus improving its performance. Empirical evaluation on a

stringent constraints on dark energy and alternative gravity models.
Particularly successful in efficiently probing the vast model space has been
the effective field theory of dark energy and modified gravity, providing a
unified framework for generalised cosmological predictions. However, the
optimal parametrisation of the free time-dependent functions inherent to the
formalism is still unresolved. It should respect a multitude of requirements,
ranging from simplicity, generality, and representativity of known theories to
computational efficiency. But in particular, for theoretical soundness, the
parameter space should adhere to strict stability requirements. We have
recently proposed an inherently stable effective field theory with physical
basis of Planck mass evolution, sound speed of the scalar field fluctuation,
kinetic coefficient, and background expansion, which covers Horndeski models
with luminal speed of gravity. Here we devise a parametrisation of these basis
functions that can straightforwardly be configured to evade theoretical
pathologies such as ghost or gradient instabilities or to accommodate further
theoretical priors such as (sub)luminal scalar sound speed. The parametrisation
is simple yet general, conveniently represents a broad range of known dark
energy and gravitational theories, and with a simple additional approximation
can be rendered numerically highly efficient. Finally, by operating in our new
basis, we show that there are no general limitations from stability
requirements on the current values that can be assumed by the phenomenological
modification of the Poisson equation and the gravitational slip besides the
exclusion of anti-gravity. The inherently stable effective field theory is
ready for implementation in parameter estimation analyses employing linear
cosmological observations.

assumptions required to implement a given cryptographic primitive. One such
primitive is the one-time memory (OTM), introduced by Goldwasser, Kalai, and
Rothblum [CRYPTO 2008], which is a classical functionality modeled after a
non-interactive 1-out-of-2 oblivious transfer, and which is complete for
one-time classical and quantum programs. It is known that secure OTMs do not
exist in the standard model in both the classical and quantum settings. Here,
we propose a scheme for using quantum information, together with the assumption
of stateless (i.e., reusable) hardware tokens, to build statistically secure
OTMs. Via the semidefinite programming-based quantum games framework of Gutoski
and Watrous [STOC 2007], we prove security for a malicious receiver making at
most 0.114n adaptive queries to the token (for n the key size), in the quantum
universal composability framework, but leave open the question of security
against a polynomial amount of queries. Compared to alternative schemes derived
from the literature on quantum money, our scheme is technologically simple
since it is of the ""prepare-and-measure"" type. We also give two impossibility
results showing certain assumptions in our scheme cannot be relaxed.

formulas of Eskin-Masur-Zorich that express these constants in terms of
Masur-Veech strata volumes, with a recent result for the large genus

suggested in the Type-II two Higgs doublet model: if the Yukawa couplings of
down-type fermions have wrong-sign, the contributions from $t'$ and $b'$ to
$\kappa_g$ are cancelled. We study the theoretical and experimental constraints
on this model, focusing on the heavy Higgs bosons. Two constraining features
are pointed out. First the exact wrong-sign limit does not allow the alignment,
which makes the perturbative unitarity for the scalar-scalar scattering put the
upper bounds on the heavy Higgs boson masses like $M_H, M_A \lesssim 920$ GeV
and $M_{H^\pm} \lesssim 620$ GeV. Secondly, the Yukawa couplings of the fourth
generation fermions to the heavy Higgs bosons are generically large as being
proportional to the heavy fermion mass and, for the down-type fermions, to
$\tan\beta$ as well. The gluon fusion productions of $H$ and $A$ through the
fourth generation quark loops become significant. We found that the current LHC
data on $pp \to Z Z$ for $H$ along with the theoretical and indirect
constraints exclude the model at leading order.

novel proximal algorithm for solving general semidefinite programming problems.
The proposed methodology, based on the primal-dual hybrid gradient method,
allows the presence of linear inequalities without the need of adding extra
slack variables and avoids solving a linear system at each iteration. More
importantly, it does simultaneously compute the dual variables associated with
the linear constraints. The main contribution of this work is to achieve a
substantial speedup by effectively adjusting the proposed algorithm in order to
exploit the low-rank property inherent to several semidefinite programming
problems. This proposed modification is the key element that allows the

resources to help it evaluate a complex circuit without leaking any information
about the input (other than its length) to the server. In this paper, we
consider delegation schemes for quantum circuits, where we try to minimize the
quantum operations needed by the client. We construct a new scheme for
delegating a large circuit family, which we call ""C+P circuits"". ""C+P"" circuits
are the circuits composed of Toffoli gates and diagonal gates. Our scheme is
non-interactive, requires very little quantum computation from the client
(proportional to input length but independent of the circuit size), and can be
proved secure in the quantum random oracle model, without relying on additional
assumptions, such as the existence of fully homomorphic encryption. In practice
the random oracle can be replaced by an appropriate hash function or block
cipher, for example, SHA-3, AES.
  This protocol allows a client to delegate the most expensive part of some
quantum algorithms, for example, Shor's algorithm. The previous protocols that
are powerful enough to delegate Shor's algorithm require either many rounds of
interactions or the existence of FHE. The protocol requires asymptotically
fewer quantum gates on the client side compared to running Shor's algorithm
locally.
  To hide the inputs, our scheme uses an encoding that maps one input qubit to
multiple qubits. We then provide a novel generalization of classical garbled
circuits (""reversible garbled circuits"") to allow the computation of Toffoli
circuits on this encoding. We also give a technique that can support the
computation of phase gates on this encoding.
  To prove the security of this protocol, we study key dependent message(KDM)
security in the quantum random oracle model. KDM security was not previously
studied in quantum settings.

estimates are obtained from modeling stellar kinematics or ionized gas dynamics
in the vicinity of the galaxy nucleus. For large early type galaxies, stellar
kinematics models predict higher masses than gas-dynamical models. In the case
of M87, this discrepancy is larger than 2 $\sigma$. Critical to gas-dynamical
modeling is the assumed underlying dynamical state of the gas: that it lies on
circular Keplerian orbits, potentially with some additional turbulent pressure
support. This is inconsistent with models of the gas flow about
low-accretion-rate SMBHs and at odds with observations of the Galactic Center.
We present a simple model for non-Keplerian gas disks and explore their
implications for SMBH mass measurements. We show that a larger central black
hole with gas experiencing small amounts of sub-Keplerian motion can produce
velocity curves similar to models that just contain circular Keplerian motions
and a lower black hole mass. However, these non-Keplerian models are
distinguishable from low-mass Keplerian models primarily through measurements
of the velocity dispersion, wherein non-Keplerian models produce higher and
narrower peak dispersions. Away from the galaxy center, but still within the
circumnuclear gas disk, non-Keplerian models also become distinguishable from
Keplerian models via a shift in the velocity curve. The velocity model
presented in this paper is capable of resolving the discrepancy between the
ionized gas dynamics and stellar kinematics mass estimates, and is applicable
to gas-dynamical mass estimates of SMBHs in general.

We use this to explain the reduction of the observed magnetic moment with

  We show how to capture $p$-power-type objectives in such separable way by
using the $L$-function method, introduced by Lata{\l}a to relate the moment of
sums of random variables to the individual marginals. We show how this quickly
leads to a constant-factor approximation for very general subset selection
problem with $p$-moment objective.
  Moreover, we give a constant-factor approximation for SLBp, improving on the
recent $O(p/\ln p)$-approximation of [Gupta et al., SODA 18]. Here the
application of the method is much more involved. In particular, we need to
sharply connect the expected $l_p$-norm of a random vector with the $p$-moments
of its marginals (machine loads), taking into account simultaneously the
different scales of the loads that are incurred by an unknown assignment.

To further improve the location performance, a joint phasor measurement units

significant aspect of our methodology is that under very low observability (7%
of buses), the algorithm is still able to localize the faulted line to a small
neighborhood with high probability. The performance of our scheme is validated
through simulations of faults of various types in the IEEE 39-bus and 68-bus

magnetospheres and periodic variability in stellar magnetism. Thus an ideal SPI
search consists of multiple epochs containing observations on consecutive
nights spanning at least one complete planetary orbit. Such data sets are rare
but do exist for some of the most intensely studied hot Jupiter systems. One
such system is HD 189733 for which six suitable SPI data sets exist, the result
of spectroscopic monitoring to perform some of the first SPI searches and also
to study the star's magnetic field. Here we perform a uniform analysis of six
archival Ca II K data sets for HD 189733, spanning 2006 June through 2015 July,
in order to search for magnetic SPI signatures in the chromospheric line
variations. We find significant evidence for modulations of Ca II K with a
$2.29\pm0.04$ day period in the 2013 August data, which is consistent with the
planet's orbital period. The peak in the orbital variations occurs at
$\phi_\text{orb} \approx 0.9$, which corresponds to the SPI emission leading
the planet with a phase difference of $\Delta\phi \approx 40^\circ$ from the
sub-planetary point. This is consistent with the phase lead predictions of
non-linear force-free magnetic field SPI models. The stellar magnetic field
strength at the planet's orbit is greatest in 2013 August which, due to the
energy released in magnetic SPI scaling with $B_*$, lends strength to the SPI
interpretation.

that can not be fully apprehended by the traditional fading models. For
instance, the wireless channel may often be dominated by a finite number of
specular components, the conventional Gaussian assumption may not be applied to
the diffuse scattered waves and the point scatterers may be inhomogeneously
distributed. These physical attributes were incorporated into the
state-of-the-art fading models, such as the kappa-mu shadowed fading model, the
generalized two-ray fading model, and the fluctuating two ray fading model.
Unfortunately, much of the existing published work commonly imposed arbitrary
assumptions on the channel parameters to achieve theoretical tractability,
thereby limiting their application to represent a diverse range of propagation
environments. This motivates us to find a more general fading model that
incorporates multiple specular components with clusterized diffuse scattered
waves, but achieves analytical tractability at the same time. To this end, we
introduced the Multiple-Waves with Generalized Diffuse Scatter (MWGD) and
Fluctuating Multiple-Ray (FMR) model that allow an arbitrary number of specular
components and assume generalized diffuse scattered model. We derive the
distribution functions of the signal envelop in closed form and calculate
second order statistics of the proposed fading model. Furthermore, we evaluate
the performance metrics of wireless communications systems, such as the
capacity, outage probability, and average bit error rate. Through numerical
simulations, we obtain important new insights into the link performance of the
5G communications while considering a diverse range of fading conditions and

process up to terabytes of data, regularly exceeding the memory capacity of
available computers. Data compression is an effective strategy to reduce this
memory requirement by a certain factor, particularly if some loss in accuracy
is acceptable. A popular alternative is checkpointing, where data is stored at
selected points in time, and values at other times are recomputed as needed
from the last stored state. This allows arbitrarily large adjoint computations
with limited memory, at the cost of additional recomputations.
  In this paper, we combine compression and checkpointing for the first time to
compute a realistic seismic inversion. The combination of checkpointing and
compression allows larger adjoint computations compared to using only
compression, and reduces the recomputation overhead significantly compared to
using only checkpointing.

  transform and the Wigner distribution","4 pages",,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a new method to estimate instantaneous frequency
using a combined approach based on the discrete linear chirp transform (DLCT)
and the Wigner distribution (WD). The DLCT locally represents a signal as a
superposition of linear chirps while the WD provides maximum energy
concentration along the instantaneous frequency in the time-frequency domain
for each of the chirps. The developed approach takes advantage of the
separation of the linear chirps given by the DLCT, and that for each of them,
the WD provides an ideal representation. Combining the WD of the linear chirp
components, we obtain a time-frequency representation free of cross-terms that
clearly displays the instantaneous frequency. Applying this procedure locally,
we obtain an instantaneous frequency estimate of a non-stationary
multicomponent signal. The proposed method is illustrated by simulation. The
results indicate the method is efficient for the instantaneous frequency
estimation of multicomponent signals embedded in noise, even in cases of low
signal to noise ratio.

Significant revisions from the previous version",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Network pruning is widely used for reducing the heavy inference cost of deep
models in low-resource settings. A typical pruning algorithm is a three-stage
pipeline, i.e., training (a large model), pruning and fine-tuning. During
pruning, according to a certain criterion, redundant weights are pruned and
important weights are kept to best preserve the accuracy. In this work, we make
several surprising observations which contradict common beliefs. For all
state-of-the-art structured pruning algorithms we examined, fine-tuning a
pruned model only gives comparable or worse performance than training that
model with randomly initialized weights. For pruning algorithms which assume a
predefined target network architecture, one can get rid of the full pipeline
and directly train the target network from scratch. Our observations are
consistent for multiple network architectures, datasets, and tasks, which imply
that: 1) training a large, over-parameterized model is often not necessary to
obtain an efficient final model, 2) learned ""important"" weights of the large
model are typically not useful for the small pruned model, 3) the pruned
architecture itself, rather than a set of inherited ""important"" weights, is
more crucial to the efficiency in the final model, which suggests that in some
cases pruning can be useful as an architecture search paradigm. Our results
suggest the need for more careful baseline evaluations in future research on
structured pruning methods. We also compare with the ""Lottery Ticket
Hypothesis"" (Frankle & Carbin 2019), and find that with optimal learning rate,
the ""winning ticket"" initialization as used in Frankle & Carbin (2019) does not
bring improvement over random initialization.

J2032+4127 / MT91 213 in the energy range between 100 GeV and 20 TeV with the
VERITAS and MAGIC imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope arrays. The binary
orbit has a period of approximately 50 years, with the most recent periastron
occurring on 2017 November 13. Our observations span from 18 months prior to
periastron to one month after. A new, point-like, gamma-ray source is detected,
coincident with the location of PSR J2032+4127 / MT91 213. The gamma-ray light
curve and spectrum are well-characterized over the periastron passage. The flux
is variable over at least an order of magnitude, peaking at periastron, thus
providing a firm association of the TeV source with the pulsar / Be star
system. Observations prior to periastron show a cutoff in the spectrum at an
energy around 0.5 TeV. This result adds a new member to the small population of
known TeV binaries, and it identifies only the second source of this class in
which the nature and properties of the compact object are firmly established.
  We compare the gamma-ray results with the light curve measured with the X-ray
Telescope (XRT) on board the Neil Gehrels \textit{Swift} Observatory and with
the predictions of recent theoretical models of the system. We conclude that
significant revision of the models is required to explain the details of the
emission we have observed, and we discuss the relationship between the binary
system and the overlapping steady extended source, TeV J2032+4130.

everything boils down to physics. I outline a theory of knowledge that I first
proposed in my 2015 FQXi essay on which knowledge has the structure of a
scale-free network. In this theory, although some disciplines are in a sense
""more fundamental"" than others, we never get to a ""most fundamental""

while some sociologists believe that sociology is fundamental.

We link features of step-growth polymerisation to the properties of the

suitable encoding of fermionic degrees of freedom into qubits. Here we revisit
the Superfast Encoding introduced by Kitaev and one of the authors. This
encoding maps a target fermionic Hamiltonian with two-body interactions on a
graph of degree $d$ to a qubit simulator Hamiltonian composed of Pauli
operators of weight $O(d)$. A system of $m$ fermi modes gets mapped to
$n=O(md)$ qubits. We propose Generalized Superfast Encodings (GSE) which
require the same number of qubits as the original one but have more favorable
properties. First, we describe a GSE such that the corresponding quantum code
corrects any single-qubit error provided that the interaction graph has degree
$d\ge 6$. In contrast, we prove that the original Superfast Encoding lacks the
error correction property for $d\le 6$. Secondly, we describe a GSE that
reduces the Pauli weight of the simulator Hamiltonian from $O(d)$ to
$O(\log{d})$. The robustness against errors and a simplified structure of the
simulator Hamiltonian offered by GSEs can make simulation of fermionic systems
within the reach of near-term quantum devices. As an example, we apply the new
encoding to the fermionic Hubbard model on a 2D lattice.

a grid-constrained transactive distribution system market (DSM) that are at a
distance away from the substation, requiring longer paths to connect to the
substation. When the grid operates closer to its physical limits in terms of
line capacities and voltage deviations, these users are more likely to cause
grid violations than others in the vicinity of the substation. Conversely,
increased energy consumption by users near the substation can choke off the
supply to those at the grid s extremities. This research describes a novel
mechanism to charge users in a more equitable manner, by regularizing the
distribution system operator (DSO)s social welfare based objective function
with a fairness criterion. The Jains index of fairness is used in this context
and corresponding fairness DLMP component is derived. The overall problem
entails the maximization of the regularized objective within a set of linear
constraints. The constraints that ensure that the grids voltage and line power
limits are not violated. Constrained optimization is carried out in an
iterative manner through dual decomposition where the dual variables and unit
costs are incrementally updated by the DSO using the augmented Lagrangian
method (ALM). Simulations reported in this study confirm the effectiveness of
the proposed approach.

function values. In addition, IOHprofiler also allows to track the evolution of
algorithm parameters, making our tool particularly useful for the analysis,
comparison, and design of (self-)adaptive algorithms.
  IOHprofiler is a ready-to-use software. It consists of two parts: an
experimental part, which generates the running time data, and a post-processing
part, which produces the summarizing comparisons and statistical evaluations.
The experimental part is build on the COCO software, which has been adjusted to
cope with optimization problems that are formulated as functions
$f:\mathcal{S}^n \to \R$ with $\mathcal{S}$ being a discrete alphabet of
integers. The post-processing part is our own work. It can be used as a
stand-alone tool for the evaluation of running time data of arbitrary benchmark
problems. It accepts as input files not only the output files of IOHprofiler,
but also original COCO data files. The post-processing tool is designed for an
interactive evaluation, allowing the user to chose the ranges and the precision
of the displayed data according to his/her needs.

is $S^2$ from Heron's formula does not extend to quadrilaterals by considering
Brahmagupta, Bretschneider and Coolidge's area formulae. That $N$-a-gonland is
more generally $CP^{N - 2}$ (with $CP^1 = S^2$ recovering the triangleland
sphere) follows from Kendall's extremization that is habitually used in Shape
Theory, or the generalized Hopf map. We further explain our observation of
non-extension in terms of total area not providing a shape quantity for
quadrilaterals. It is rather the square root of of sums of squares of subsystem
areas that provides a shape quantity; we clarify this further in
representation-theoretic terms. The triangleland $S^2$ moreover also
generalizes to $d$-simplexlands being $S^{d(d + 1)/2 - 1}$ topologically by
Casson's observation. For the 3-simplex - alias tetrahaedron - while volume
provides a shape quantity and is specified by the della Francesca-Tartaglia
formula, the analogue of finding Heron eigenvectors is undefined. $d$-volume
moreover provides a shape quantity for the $d$-simplex, specified by the
Cayley-Menger formula generalization of the Heron and della Francesca-Tartaglia
formulae. While eigenvectors can be defined for the even-$d$ Cayley-Menger
formulae, the dimension count does not however work out for these to provide
on-sphere conditions. We finally point out the multiple dimensional
coincidences behind the derivation of the space of triangles from Heron's
formula. This article is a useful check on how far the least technically
involved derivation of the smallest nontrivial shape space can be taken. This
is significant since Shape Theory is a futuristic branch of mathematics, with
substantial applications in both Statistics (Shape Statistics) and Theoretical
Physics (Background Independence: of major relevance to Classical and Quantum
Gravitational Theory).

observed purchase decisions satisfy the revealed preference (RP) axioms of the
utility maximization theory (UMT). Researchers using survey or experimental
panel data sets on prices and consumption to answer this question face the
well-known problem of measurement error. We show that ignoring measurement
error in the RP approach may lead to overrejection of the UMT. To solve this
problem, we propose a new statistical RP framework for consumption panel data
sets that allows for testing the UMT in the presence of measurement error. Our
test is applicable to all consumer models that can be characterized by their
first-order conditions. Our approach is nonparametric, allows for unrestricted

the UMT. First, we find support in a survey data set for the dynamic and

\emph{nonclassical} measurement error in consumption. In the second
application, we cannot reject the static UMT in a widely used experimental data

misperception due to the experimental design. The first finding stands in

signSGD converges in the large and mini-batch settings, establishing
convergence for a parameter regime of Adam as a byproduct. Aggregating sign
gradients by majority vote means that no individual worker has too much power.

spatial associations between teeth and tooth surfaces and that dental hygienic

up to first order derivatives of the fields in the Lagrangian. We discuss with
detail the four dimensional case and devote some attention to the mechanism of
topological mass generation originated by couplings of the form $B\wedge F$
between a $p-$form and a $(3-p)-$form. As a result, we show the system of the
interacting $p-$forms $(p=1,2,3)$ is equivalent to a parity violating, massive,
Proca vector field model. Finally, we discuss some cosmological applications.
In a first case we study a very minimalistic system composed by a $3-$form
coupled to a $0-$form. The $3-$form induces an effective potential which acts
as a cosmological constant term suitable to drive the late time accelerated
expansion of the universe dominated by dark energy. We study the dynamics of
the system and determine its critical points and stability. Additionally, we
study a system composed by a scalar field and a $1$-form. This case is
interesting because the presence of a coupled $1-$form can generate non
vanishing anisotropic signatures during the late time accelerated expansion. We
discuss the evolution of cosmological parameters such as the equation of state
in this model.

show how first-principles calculations of thermodynamic transition levels,
temperature effects of ionization energies, and nonradiative capture

hybrid functional calculations for two important defects in GaN that have

random access uplink (RA-UL) transmissions. SC-UL is perceived as a viable tool
to control Quality-of-Service (QoS) levels while entailing some overhead in the
scheduling request prior to any UL transmission. On the other hand, RA-UL is a
simple single-phase transmission strategy. While this obviously eliminates
scheduling overheads, very little is known about how scalable RA-UL is. At this
critical junction, there is a dire need to analyze the scalability of these two
paradigms. To that end, this paper develops a spatiotemporal mathematical
framework to analyze and assess the performance of SC-UL and RA-UL. The
developed paradigm jointly utilizes stochastic geometry and queueing theory.
Based on such a framework, we show that the answer to the ""scheduling vs.

Particularly, RA-UL scheme offers low access delays but suffers from limited
scalability, i.e., cannot support a large number of IoT devices. On the other

tend to eject their fastest stars toward the binary orbital plane. We calculate
the ejection rates as the binary SMBHs inspiral, and find that they eject stars

multilayer-perceptron based method using hand-engineered features as far back
as 1990; Urban et al (2011) apply machine learning to tableau calculus; and
Loos et al (2017) recently proposed a method for guiding the E theorem prover

limitation: they all rely on the axioms of classical first-order logic. Very
little attention has been paid to automated theorem proving for non-classical
logics. One of the only recent examples is McLaughlin & Pfenning (2008) who
applied the polarized inverse method to intuitionistic propositional logic. The
literature is otherwise mostly silent. This is truly unfortunate, as there are
many reasons to desire non-classical proofs over classical.
Constructive/intuitionistic proofs should be of particular interest to computer
scientists thanks to the well-known Curry-Howard correspondence (Howard, 1980)

intuitionistic logic and vice versa. This work explores using Q-learning

attributes, and relationship between entities, is finding more and more
application scenarios in various natural language processing tasks. In a
typical knowledge graph like Wikidata, entities usually have a large number of
attributes, but it is difficult to know which ones are important. The
importance of attributes can be a valuable piece of information in various
applications spanning from information retrieval to natural language
generation. In this paper, we propose a general method of using external user
generated text data to evaluate the relative importance of an entity's
attributes. To be more specific, we use the word/sub-word embedding techniques
to match the external textual data back to entities' attribute name and values
and rank the attributes by their matching cohesiveness. To our best knowledge,
this is the first work of applying vector based semantic matching to important
attribute identification, and our method outperforms the previous traditional
methods. We also apply the outcome of the detected important attributes to a
language generation task; compared with previous generated text, the new method
generates much more customized and informative messages.

work, nonlinear dynamics of the corresponding mode saturation and the
fluctuation induced EP transport is studied by hybrid
magnetohydrodynamic-gyrokinetic simulations. For the reversed shear Alfv\'en
eigenmode driven by magnetically trapped EP precession resonance in the central
core region of DTT plasmas, the saturation is mainly due to radial decoupling
of resonant trapped EPs. Consistent with the wave-EP resonance structure, EP
transport occurs in a similar scale to the mode width. On the other hand,
passing EP transport is analyzed in detail for toroidal Alfv\'en eigenmode in
the outer core region, with mode drive from both passing and trapped EPs. It is
shown that passing EPs experience only weak redistributions in the weakly
unstable case; and the transport extends to meso-scale diffusion in the
strongly unstable case, due to orbit stochasticity induced by resonance
overlap. Here, weakly/strongly unstable regime is determined by Chirikov
condition for resonance overlap. This work then further illuminates rich and
diverse nonlinear EP dynamics related to burning plasma studies, and the
capability of DTT to address these key physics.

conventional stochastic gradient descent, making it readily available for many

a set of old conjectures about symmetries in quantum gravity. We first show
that any global symmetry, discrete or continuous, in a bulk quantum gravity
theory with a CFT dual would lead to an inconsistency in that CFT, and thus
that there are no bulk global symmetries in AdS/CFT. We then argue that any
""long-range"" bulk gauge symmetry leads to a global symmetry in the boundary
CFT, whose consistency requires the existence of bulk dynamical objects which
transform in all finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the bulk
gauge group. We mostly assume that all internal symmetry groups are compact,
but we also give a general condition on CFTs, which we expect to be true quite
broadly, which implies this. We extend all of these results to the case of
higher-form symmetries. Finally we extend a recently proposed new motivation
for the weak gravity conjecture to more general gauge groups, reproducing the
""convex hull condition"" of Cheung and Remmen.
  An essential point, which we dwell on at length, is precisely defining what
we mean by gauge and global symmetries in the bulk and boundary. Quantum field
theory results we meet while assembling the necessary tools include continuous
global symmetries without Noether currents, new perspectives on spontaneous
symmetry-breaking and 't Hooft anomalies, a new order parameter for confinement
which works in the presence of fundamental quarks, a Hamiltonian lattice
formulation of gauge theories with arbitrary discrete gauge groups, an
extension of the Coleman-Mandula theorem to discrete symmetries, and an
improved explanation of the decay $\pi^0\to\gamma \gamma$ in the standard model
of particle physics. We also describe new black hole solutions of the Einstein

interaction (FSI) between a generalized Newtonian fluid and a hyperelastic
tube. Physiological flows, especially in hemodynamics, serve as primary
examples of such FSI phenomena. The small scale of the physical system renders
the flow field, under the power-law rheological model, amenable to a
closed-form solution using the lubrication approximation. On the other hand,
negligible shear stresses on the walls of a long vessel allow the structure to
be treated as a pressure vessel. The constitutive equation for the microtube is
prescribed via the strain energy functional for an incompressible, isotropic
Mooney--Rivlin material. We employ both the thin- and thick-walled formulations
of the pressure vessel theory, and derive the static relation between the
pressure load and the deformation of the structure. We harness the latter to
determine the flow rate--pressure drop relationship for non-Newtonian flow in
thin- and thick-walled soft hyperelastic microtubes. Through illustrative
examples, we discuss how a hyperelastic tube supports the same pressure load as
a linearly elastic tube with smaller deformation, thus requiring a higher
pressure drop across itself to maintain a fixed flow rate.

$D$ is a product of simplices. We show that MWU converges almost always for
small enough stepsizes to critical points that satisfy the second order KKT

amounts of traffic data but analyzing such data for interpretable and
actionable insights poses challenges. A hierarchical clustering of the trips
has many uses such as discovering shortest paths, common routes and often
traversed areas. However, hierarchical clustering typically has time complexity
of $O(n^2 \log n)$ where $n$ is the number of instances, and is difficult to
scale to large data sets associated with GPS data. Furthermore, incremental
hierarchical clustering is still a developing area. Prefix trees (also called
tries) can be efficiently constructed and updated in linear time (in $n$). We
show how a specially constructed trie can compactly store the trips and further
show this trie is equivalent to a dendrogram that would have been built by
classic agglomerative hierarchical algorithms using a specific distance metric.
This allows creating hierarchical clusterings of GPS trip data and updating
this hierarchy in linear time. %we can extract a meaningful kernel and can also
interpret the structure as clusterings of differing granularity as one
progresses down the tree. We demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed
approach on a real world data set of half a million taxis' GPS traces, well
beyond the capabilities of agglomerative clustering methods. Our work is not

finite angular momentum is generated by the heat current. This mechanism is
analogous to the Edelstein effect in electronic systems. This effect requires
crystals with sufficiently low crystallographic symmetries, such as polar or
chiral crystal structures. Because of the positive charges of the nuclei, this
phonon angular momentum induces magnetization. In addition, when the crystal
can freely rotate, this generated phonon angular momentum is converted to a
rigidbody rotation of the crystal, due to the conservation of the total angular
momentum. Furthermore, in metallic crystals, the phonon angular momentum will
be partially converted into spin angular momentum of electrons.

current frameworks to learn a robust mapping between the geometry of sketches

present an approach for learning to synthesize a photo-realistic image from a
face sketch in an unsupervised fashion. In contrast to current unsupervised
image-to-image translation techniques, our framework leverages a novel
perceptual discriminator to learn the geometry of human face. Learning facial
prior information empowers the network to remove the geometrical artifacts in
the face sketch. We demonstrate that a simultaneous optimization of the face

combination with a texture-wise discriminator, results in a significant
improvement in quality and recognition rate of the synthesized photos. We
evaluate the proposed network by conducting extensive experiments on multiple

this obstruction implies biholomorphic equivalence to the unit ball, subject to
the existence of a holomorphic vector field satisfying a mild approximate
tangency condition along the boundary. In particular, by considering the Euler
vector field multiplied by $i$ the result applies to all domains in a large

establishing an integral identity involving the CR curvature of $\partial

the bulk topological invariants protected by the combined operation of a
two-fold rotation $C_{2z}$ and time-reversal $T$ symmetries. We define
topological invariants as obstructions to having smooth Bloch wave functions
compatible with a momentum-independent symmetry representation. When the Bloch
wave functions are required to be smooth, the information on the band topology
is contained in the symmetry representation. This implies that the
$d$-dimensional homotopy class of the unitary matrix representation of the
symmetry operator corresponds to the $d$-dimensional topological invariants.
Here, we prove that the second Stiefel-Whitney number, a two-dimensional
topological invariant protected by $C_{2z}T$, is the homotopy invariant that
characterizes the second homotopy class of the matrix representation of
$C_{2z}T$. As an application of our result, we show that the three-dimensional
bulk topological invariant for the $C_{2z}T$-protected topological crystalline
insulator proposed by C. Fang and L. Fu in Phys. Rev. B 91, 161105(R) (2015),
which we call the 3D strong Stiefel Whitney insulator, is identical to the
quantized magnetoelectric polarizability. The bulk-boundary correspondence
associated with the quantized magnetoelectric polarizability shows that the 3D
strong Stiefel-Whitney insulator has chiral hinges states as well as 2D
massless surface Dirac fermions. This shows that the 3D strong Stiefel Whitney
insulator has the characteristics of both the first order and the second order
topological insulators, simultaneously, which is consistent with the recent
classification of higher-order topological insulators protected by an order-two
symmetry.

interactions. Linking individual-level behaviour to coarse-grained descriptions
of animal groups has been a question of fundamental interest. Here, we present
two complementary approaches to deriving coarse-grained descriptions of
collective behaviour at so-called mesoscopic scales, which account for the
stochasticity arising from the finite sizes of animal groups. We construct
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) for a coarse-grained variable that
describes the order/consensus within a group. The first method of construction
is based on van Kampen's system-size expansion of transition rates. The second
method employs Gillespie's chemical Langevin equations. We apply these two
methods to two microscopic models from the literature, in which organisms
stochastically interact and choose between two directions/choices of foraging.
These `binary-choice' models differ only in the types of interactions between
individuals, with one assuming simple pair-wise interactions, and the other
incorporating higher-order effects. In both cases, the derived mesoscopic SDEs
have multiplicative, or state-dependent, noise. However, the different models
demonstrate the contrasting effects of noise: increasing order in the pair-wise
interaction model, whilst reducing order in the higher-order interaction model.
Although both methods yield identical SDEs for such binary-choice, or
one-dimensional, systems, the relative tractability of the chemical Langevin
approach is beneficial in generalizations to higher-dimensions. In summary,
this book chapter provides a pedagogical review of two complementary methods to
construct mesoscopic descriptions from microscopic rules and demonstrates how
resultant multiplicative noise can have counter-intuitive effects on shaping
collective behaviour.

global convergence results but does not work when there is a standard $\ell_2$
regularizer, which is useful to have in practice. We show that sample
efficiency can indeed depend on the presence of the regularizer: we construct a
simple distribution in d dimensions which the optimal regularized neural net
learns with $O(d)$ samples but the NTK requires $\Omega(d^2)$ samples to learn.

recombining plasma model with an electron temperature of ~ 0.2 keV, an initial
ionization temperature of ~ 3 keV, and an ionization parameter of ~ 9 $\times$
10$^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$s. This is the first detection of the recombining plasma in
CTB 1. The electron temperature in the inner-shell region decreases outwards,
which implies that the recombining plasma is likely formed by the thermal
conduction via interaction with the surrounding cold interstellar medium. The
Ne abundance is almost uniform in the observed regions whereas Fe is more
abundant toward the southwest of the remnant, suggesting an asymmetric ejecta
distribution. We also detect a hard tail above the 2 keV band that is fitted
with a power-law function with a photon index of 2-3. The flux of the hard tail
in the 2-10 keV band is ~ 5 $\times$ 10$^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and is
peaked at the center of CTB 1. Its origin is unclear but one possibility is a
putative pulsar wind nebula associated with CTB 1.

extend this analyze by also studying the KAM with an adaptation of the
statistical-DMFT method that was developped elsewhere. We review the
distributions of local potential scattering and their evolution with model

local site neighborhood, connection with percolation issue. Relevence for Kondo

Hamiltonian introduced by Pirogov and Sinai. However, unlike the (relative)

physically well-founded intrinsic properties. The developed approach allowed us
to give a proper mathematical definition of the Hamiltonian without involving
the notion of potential, to propose a justification of the Gibbs formula for

class of specifications, which can be represented in Gibbsian form, is.

(ADAF)-based frequency synchronization method for the uplink of a massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiuser network, which is applicable
for users with either separate or overlapped angle-of-arrival (AoA) regions.
For each user, we first introduce the angle-constraining matrix (ACM), which
consists of a set of selected match-filter (MF) beamformers pointing to the
AoAs of the interested user. Then, the adaptive beamformer can be acquired by
appropriately designing the ADAF vectors. Such beamformer can achieve two-stage
adaptive multiuser interference (MUI) suppression, i.e., inherently suppressing
the MUI from non-overlapping users by ACM in the first stage and substantially
mitigating the MUI from adjacent overlapping users by ADAF vector in the second
stage. For both separate and mutually overlapping users, the carrier frequency
offset (CFO) estimation and subsequent data detection can be performed
independently for each user, which significantly reduces computational
complexity. Moreover, ADAF is rather robust to imperfect AoA knowledge and side
cluster of scatterers, making itself promising for multiuser uplink
transmission. We also analyze the performance of CFO estimation and obtain an
approximated closed-form expression of mean-squared error (MSE). The
effectiveness of the proposed method and its superiority over the existing
methods are demonstrated by numerical results.

the effective light neutrino Lagrangian enjoys an additional invariance under a
Friedberg-Lee (FL) transformation on the left-handed flavor neutrino fields,
that leads to a highly predictive and testable scenario. While both types of
the light neutrino mass ordering, i.e., Normal Ordering (NO) as well as the
Inverted Ordering (IO) are allowed, the absolute scale of neutrino masses is
fixed by the vanishing determinant of light Majorana neutrino mass matrix
$M_\nu$. We show that for both types of mass ordering, whilst the atmospheric
mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ is in general nonmaximal ($\theta_{23}\neq \pi/4$),
the Dirac CP phase $\delta$ is exactly maximal ($\delta=\pi/2,3\pi/2$) for IO
and nearly maximal for NO owing to $\cos\delta\propto \sin\theta_{13}$. For the
NO, very tiny nonvanishing Majorana CP violation might appear through one of
the Majorana phases $\beta$; otherwise the model predicts vanishing Majorana CP
violation. Thus, despite the fact, that from the measurement of $\theta_{23}$,
it is difficult to rule out the model, any large deviation of $\delta$ from its
maximality, will surely falsify the scenario. For a comprehensive numerical
analysis, beside fitting the neutrino oscillation global fit data, we also
present a study on the $\nu_\mu\rightarrow \nu_e$ oscillation which is expected
to show up Dirac CP violation in different long baseline experiments. Finally,
assuming purely astrophysical sources, we calculate the Ultra High Energy (UHE)
neutrino flavor flux ratios at neutrino telescopes, such as IceCube, from which
statements on the octant of $\theta_{23}$ could be made in our model.

on a centralized mobility anchor between eNode B (eNB) elements and the network
gateways. The mobility anchor is performed based on General Packet Radio
Service tunnelling protocol (GTP), which has numerous drawbacks, including high
tunnelling overhead and suboptimal routing between mobile devices on the same

architecture for future mobile networks. The proposed scheme is based on IP
encapsulated within IP (IP-in-IP) for mobility management and data delivery. In
this scheme, the core network functions via layer 3 switching (L3S), and data
delivery is implemented based on IP-in-IP routing, thus eliminating the GTP
tunnelling protocol. For handover between eNB elements located near to one
another, we propose the creation of a tunnel that maintains data delivery to
mobile devices until the new eNB element updates the route with the gateway,
which prevents data packet loss during handover. For this, we propose Generic
Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnelling protocol. We describe the results of
numerical analyses and simulation results showing that the proposed network

Talbot lithography (ATL). This method offers many advantages over other
techniques, such as high resolution, large depth of focus, high throughput,
etc. Although the technique has been studied in the past, its limits have not
yet been explored. Increasing the efficiency and the resolution of the method
is essential and might enable many applications in science and technology. In
this work, we combine this technique with spatially coherent and
quasi-monochromatic light at extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths and explore
new mask design schemes in order to enhance its throughput and resolution. We
report on simulations of various mask designs in order to explore their
efficiency. Advanced and optimized nanofabrication techniques have to be
utilized to achieve high quality and efficient masks for ATL. Exposures using
coherent EUV radiation from the Swiss light source (SLS) have been performed,
pushing the resolution limits of the technique for dense hole or dot patterning
down to 40 nm pitch. In addition, through extensive simulations, alternative
mask designs with rings instead of holes are explored for the efficient
patterning of hole/dot arrays. We show that these rings exhibit similar aerial
images to hole arrays, while enabling higher efficiency and thereby increased
throughput for ATL exposures. The mask designs with rings show that they are
less prone to problems associated with pattern collapse during the
nanofabrication process and therefore are promising for achieving higher
resolution.

numerical propagation from the issue of adequate time-resolution of the laser
field by keeping integrals intact in the Magnus expansion, and eliminating

and multiple access. NOMA with compressive sensing based multiuser detection is
one of the promising candidates to address the challenges of mMTC. The survey
article aims at providing an overview of the current state-of-art research work
in various compressive sensing based techniques that enable NOMA. We present
characteristics of different algorithms and compare their pros and cons,
thereby provide useful insights for researchers to make further contributions

Here we perform extensive molecular dynamics simulations to explore the
influence of an externally imposed electric field on liquid water under ambient
conditions. Using self-developed analysis tools and rigorous statistical
analysis, we unambiguously show that water hydration shells break into
subcompartments, which were hitherto not observed due to radial averaging. The
shape of subcompartments is sensitive to the field magnitude, and affects
excitations of the hydrogen bond network including the femtosecond stretching
and the sub-picosecond restructuring of hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, by
analysing the reorientational dynamics of water molecules, we ascertain the
existence of cooperative excitations of small water clusters. Enabled by the
interplay between hydrogen bonding, and the coupling of water dipoles to the
field, these coordinated motions, occurring on the picosecond time scale, are
associated with fluctuations between torque-free states of water dipoles. We
show that unlike the coupling between translation and reorientation of water
molecules, which takes place on even longer time scales, these coordinated
motions are the key for understanding the emergent anisotropy of diffusion and
viscosity of water. Particular effort is invested to provide an analysis that
allows for future experimental validation.

ammonia clusters (NH3)N with the mean size N ~230 were prepared in molecular
beams and passed through a pickup cell in which methanol molecules were
adsorbed. At the highest exploited pickup pressures, the average composition of
(NH3)N(CH3OH)M clusters was estimated to be N:M ~210:10. On the other hand, the
electron ionization of these clusters yielded about 75% of methanol-containing
fragments (NH3)n(CH3OH)mH+ compared to 25% contribution of pure ammonia
(NH3)nH+ ions. Based on this substantial disproportion, we propose the
following ionization mechanism: The prevailing ammonia is ionized in most
cases, resulting in NH+4 core solvated most likely with four ammonia molecules,
yielding the well-known ""magic number"" structure (NH3)4NH+4 . The methanol
molecules exhibit strong propensity for sticking to the fragment ion. We have
also considered mechanisms of intracluster reactions. In most cases, proton
transfer between ammonia units take place. The theoretical calculations
suggested the proton transfer either from the methyl group or from the hydroxyl

characteristic of interesting text documents. A recent proposal for measuring
topical diversity identifies three distributions for assessing the diversity of
documents: distributions of words within documents, words within topics, and
topics within documents. Topic models play a central role in this approach and,
hence, their quality is crucial to the efficacy of measuring topical diversity.
The quality of topic models is affected by two causes: generality and impurity
of topics. General topics only include common information of a background
corpus and are assigned to most of the documents. Impure topics contain words
that are not related to the topic. Impurity lowers the interpretability of
topic models. Impure topics are likely to get assigned to documents
erroneously. We propose a hierarchical re-estimation process aimed at removing
generality and impurity. Our approach has three re-estimation components: (1)
document re-estimation, which removes general words from the documents; (2)
topic re-estimation, which re-estimates the distribution over words of each
topic; and (3) topic assignment re-estimation, which re-estimates for each

consider addressing these issues by applying inhomogeneous regularization on
different image components. We formulate the inhomogeneous TV minimization
problem as a convex quadratic constrained linear programming problem. Relying
on this new model, we propose a matching pursuit based total variation
minimization method (MPTV), specifically for image deconvolution. The proposed
MPTV method is essentially a cutting-plane method, which iteratively activates
a subset of nonzero image gradients, and then solves a subproblem focusing on
those activated gradients only. Compared to existing methods, MPTV is less
sensitive to the choice of the trade-off parameter between data fitting and
regularization. Moreover, the inhomogeneity of MPTV alleviates the
over-smoothing and ringing artifacts, and improves the robustness to errors in
blur kernel. Extensive experiments on different tasks demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over the current state-of-the-art.

linear regression fit to a dataset for which the correspondences between the
independent samples and the observations are unknown. Such a problem naturally
arises in diverse domains such as computer vision, data mining, communications
and biology. In its simplest form, it is tantamount to solving a linear system
of equations, for which the entries of the right hand side vector have been
permuted. This type of data corruption renders the linear regression task
considerably harder, even in the absence of other corruptions, such as noise,
outliers or missing entries. Existing methods are either applicable only to
noiseless data or they are very sensitive to initialization or they work only
for partially shuffled data. In this paper we address these issues via an
algebraic geometric approach, which uses symmetric polynomials to extract
permutation-invariant constraints that the parameters $\xi^* \in \Re^n$ of the
linear regression model must satisfy. This naturally leads to a polynomial
system of $n$ equations in $n$ unknowns, which contains $\xi^*$ in its root
locus. Using the machinery of algebraic geometry we prove that as long as the
independent samples are generic, this polynomial system is always consistent
with at most $n!$ complex roots, regardless of any type of corruption inflicted
on the observations. The algorithmic implication of this fact is that one can
always solve this polynomial system and use its most suitable root as
initialization to the Expectation Maximization algorithm. To the best of our
knowledge, the resulting method is the first working solution for small values
of $n$ able to handle thousands of fully shuffled noisy observations in
milliseconds.

metabolic modelling and networked Cox regression, using the metabolic model of
the bacterium Helicobacter Pylori. This enables a platform both for
quantitative analysis of networked regression, but also testing the findings
from network regression (a list of significant vectors and their networked
relationships) on in vivo transcriptomic data. Data generated from the model,
using flux balance analysis to construct a Pareto front, specifically, a
trade-off of Oxygen exchange and growth rate and a trade-off of Carbon Dioxide
exchange and growth rate, is analysed and then the model is used to quantify
the success of the analysis. It was found that using the analysis,
reconstruction of the initial data was considerably more successful than a pure
noise alternative. Our methodological approach is quite general and it could be
of interest for the wider community of complex networks researchers; it is
implemented in a software tool, MoNeRe, which is freely available through the
Github platform.

mechanical simulations of the heart. However, there is no consensus on
physiologically correct and computationally tractable pericardial boundary
conditions. Here we propose to model the pericardial influence as a parallel
spring and dashpot acting in normal direction to the epicardium. Using a
four-chamber geometry, we compare a model with pericardial boundary conditions
to a model with fixated apex. The influence of pericardial stiffness is
demonstrated in a parametric study. Comparing simulation results to
measurements from cine magnetic resonance imaging reveals that adding
pericardial boundary conditions yields a better approximation with respect to
atrioventricular plane displacement, atrial filling, and overall spatial
approximation error. We demonstrate that this simple model of
pericardial-myocardial interaction can correctly predict the pumping mechanisms
of the heart as previously assessed in clinical studies. Utilizing a
pericardial model can not only provide much more realistic cardiac mechanics
simulations but also allows new insights into pericardial-myocardial

wireless ad hoc networks. In general, it is well-known that any online routing
strategy performs very poor in the worst case. The main difficulty are
uncovered regions within the wireless ad hoc network, which we denote as radio
holes. Complex shapes of radio holes, for example zig-zag-shapes, make local
geometric routing even more difficult, i.e., forwarded messages in direction to
the destination might get stuck in a dead end or are routed along very long
detours, when there is no knowledge about the ad hoc network. To obtain
knowledge about the position and shape of radio holes, we make use of a hybrid
network approach. This approach assumes that we can not just make use of the ad
hoc network but also of some cellular infrastructure, which is used to gather
knowledge about the underlying ad hoc network. Communication via the cellular
infrastructure incurs costs as cell phone providers are involved. Therefore, we
use the cellular infrastructure only to compute routing paths in the ad hoc
network. The actual data transmission takes place in the ad hoc network. In
order to find good routing paths we aim at computing an abstraction of the ad
hoc network in which radio holes are abstracted by bounding boxes. The
advantage of bounding boxes as hole abstraction is that we only have to
consider a constant number of nodes per hole. We prove that bounding boxes are
a suitable hole abstraction that allows us to find $c$-competitive paths in the
ad hoc network in case of non-intersecting bounding boxes. In case of
intersecting bounding boxes, we show via simulations that our routing strategy
significantly outperforms the so far best online routing strategies for
wireless ad hoc networks. Finally, we also present a routing strategy that is
$c$-competitive in case of pairwise intersecting bounding boxes.

The calculations are based on density functional theory and used the
generalized gradient approximation (GGA) as well as the GGA$ +U $ approach. The
latter turned out to be crucial for a correct description of the crystal phase
stability and magnetic instabilities of both compounds. While for $ {\rm NiN} $
GGA calculations predict a non-magnetic ground state with the zincblende
structure, GGA$ +U $ calculations result in a half-metallic ferromagnet with
the rocksalt structure in line with indications from the neighboring
transition-metal nitrides making $ {\rm NiN} $ a possible candidate for
spin-filter devices. For $ {\rm Ni_2N} $ GGA calculations likewise lead to a
non-magnetic behavior, which is contrasted with a ferrimagnetic ordering
obtained from the GGA$ +U $ approach. This ground state results from complex
three-dimensional exchange interaction via $ \sigma $-type and $ \pi $-type
overlap of the Ni $ 3d $ orbitals with the N $ 2p $ orbitals and may explain
the reported sensitivity of the magnetic ordering to details of the crystal

optimize measurement speed and fidelity. We experimentally test this

decreasing cost of batteries and various policy decisions. These vehicles need
to be charged and will therefore cause congestion in local distribution grids
in the future. Motivated by this, we consider a charging station with finitely
many parking spaces, in which electric vehicles arrive in order to get charged.
An EV has a random parking time and a random charging time. Both the charging
rate per vehicle and the charging rate possible for the station are assumed to
be limited. Thus, the charging rate of uncharged EVs depends on the number of
cars charging simultaneously. This model leads to a layered queueing network in
which parking spaces with EV chargers have a dual role, of a server (to cars)
and customers (to the grid). We are interested in the performance of the
aforementioned model, focusing on the fraction of vehicles that get fully
charged. To do so, we develop several bounds and asymptotic (fluid and
diffusion) approximations for the vector process, which describes the total
number of EVs and the number of not fully charged EVs in the charging station,
and we compare these bounds and approximations with numerical outcomes.

Specifically, we focus on the classical and the quantum dynamics near the
resonance junctions on the Arnold web that are formed by intersection of
independent resonances. The regime of interest models the IVR dynamics from
highly excited initial states near dissociation thresholds of molecular systems
wherein both classical and purely quantum, involving dynamical tunneling,
routes to IVR coexist. In the vicinity of a resonance junction classical chaos
is inevitably present and hence one expects the quantum IVR pathways to have a
strong classical component as well. We show that with increasing resonant
coupling strengths the classical component of IVR leads to a transition from
coherent dynamical tunneling to incoherent dynamical tunneling. Furthermore, we
establish that the quantum IVR dynamics can be predicted based on the
structures on the classical Arnold web. In addition, we investigate the nature
of the highly excited eigenstates in order to identify the quantum signatures
of the multiplicity-2 junctions. For the parameter regimes studies herein, by
projecting the eigenstates onto the Arnold web, we find that eigenstates in the

correlation functions of the particles. `Small-on-top' stratification of the

are borne by everyone. Significant variation in its level between and within

to lack of data. In this paper we relate the structural characteristics of
social capital of towns with corruption in their local governments. Using
datasets from Hungary, we quantify corruption risk by suppressed competition
and lack of transparency in the town's awarded public contracts. We
characterize social capital using social network data from a popular online
platform. Controlling for social, economic, and political factors, we find that
settlements with fragmented social networks, indicating an excess of
\textit{bonding social capital} have higher corruption risk and towns with more
diverse external connectivity, suggesting a surplus of \textit{bridging social
capital} are less exposed to corruption. We interpret fragmentation as
fostering in-group favoritism and conformity, which increase corruption, while
diversity facilitates impartiality in public life and stifles corruption.

electron-positron collider operating at centre-of-mass energies of up to 3 TeV.
CLIC will be built and operated in a staged approach with three centre-of-mass
energies currently assumed to be 380 GeV, 1.5 TeV and 3 TeV. This contribution
discusses the prospects for precision measurements of top-quark properties at
the first stage of CLIC, based on detailed simulation studies, taking into
account luminosity spectra and beam induced backgrounds, full detector
simulation based on Geant4, final state reconstruction based on particle flow
approach with PandoraPFA, jet clustering with the VLC algorithm as implemented
in the FastJet package, and flavour tagging with LcfiPlus.
  Based on a dedicated centre-of-mass energy scan around the top-quark pair
production threshold, the top-quark mass can be determined with a precision of
about 50 MeV in a theoretically well-defined manner. This scan is also
sensitive to the top-quark width and Yukawa coupling. Other approaches to
extract the top-quark mass at the first stage of CLIC make use of ISR photons
or the direct reconstruction of the top quarks. Precise measurements of the
differential top-quark pair production cross sections at 380 GeV, for different
electron beam polarisations, allow the study of top-quark couplings to
electroweak gauge bosons sensitive to new physics mass scales beyond 10 TeV.
The large number of top-quark pairs produced also allows competitive searches
for Flavour Changing Neutral Current (FCNC) top-quark decays with charm quarks
in the final state. Exclusion limits expected for 500 fb$^{-1}$ collected at
the first stage of CLIC are presented for $t\rightarrow ch$, $t\rightarrow
c\gamma$ and $t\rightarrow c E_{miss}$ channels, reaching down to $4.7 \cdot
10^{-5}$ for BR($t\rightarrow c\gamma$).

The source varied from hard to soft state within half day. We modeled the

The broad-band spectra are well fitted by an absorbed thermal Componization
model, compps, in a slab geometry. The best-fits for the two states indicate
significantly different plasma temperature of 18 and 5 keV and the Thomson
optical depth of 3 and 4, respectively. In total, 56 type-I X-ray bursts were
observed during the 2015 outburst, of which 26 detected by INTEGRAL in the hard
state, 25 by XMM-Newton in the soft state, and 5 by Swift in both states. As
the object transited from the hard to the soft state, the recurrence time for
X-ray bursts decreased from $\approx 2$ to $\approx1$ hr. The relation between
the recurrence time, $ \Delta t_{\rm rec}$, and the local mass accretion rate
per unit area onto the compact object, $\dot m$, is fitted by a power-law

that polariton lasing mediated by polariton stimulated scattering can occur
concomitantly in both types of modes in a microcavity. By adjusting the
detuning between the exciton and the radiative photon mode one can favor
polariton lasing either in the radiative or in the guided modes. Our results
suggest that the competition between these two types of polariton lasing modes
may have played a role in many previous observations of polariton lasing and
polariton Bose Einstein condensation.

unsupervised, relying solely on the structure of the network. However, these

underlying communities in the data, particularly when those structures are
highly overlapping. One way to improve the usefulness of these algorithms is by
incorporating additional background information, which can be used as a source
of constraints to direct the community detection process. In this work, we
explore the potential of semi-supervised strategies to improve algorithms for
finding overlapping communities in networks. Specifically, we propose a new
method, based on label propagation, for finding communities using a limited
number of pairwise constraints. Evaluations on synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate the potential of this approach for uncovering meaningful
community structures in cases where each node can potentially belong to more

This simple model supports three fundamental features of CP dynamics:
precipitation cells constitute a spatially interacting system; CPs come in

realization functor of motivic spaces, first studied by Isaksen and Schmidt.
Their functor goes from the $\infty$-category of motivic spaces over a base
scheme $S$ to the $\infty$-category of $p$-profinite spaces, where $p$ is a
prime which is invertible in all residue fields of $S$.
  In the first part of this paper, we refine the target of this functor to an
$\infty$-category where $p$-profinite spaces is a further completion. Roughly
speaking, this $\infty$-category is generated under cofiltered limits by those
spaces whose associated ""local system"" on $S$ is $A^1$-invariant. We then
construct a new, relative version of their \'etale realization functor which
takes into account the geometry and arithmetic of the base scheme $S$. For
example, when $S$ is the spectrum of a field $k$, our functor lands in a
certain $\infty$-category equivariant for the absolute Galois group. Our
construction relies on a relative version of \'etale homotopy types in the
sense of Artin-Mazur-Friedlander, which we also develop in some detail,
expanding on previous work of Barnea-Harpaz-Schlank.
  We then stabilize our functor, in the $S^1$-direction, to produce an \'etale
realization functor for motivic $S^1$-spectra (in other words, Nisnevich
sheaves of spectra which are $A^1$-invariant). To this end, we also develop an
$\infty$-categorical version of the theory of profinite spectra, first explored
by Quick. As an application, we refine the construction of the \'etale
$K$-theory of Dwyer and Friedlander, and define its non-commutative extension.
This latter invariant should be seen as an $\ell$-adic analog of Blanc's theory
of semi-topological $K$-theory of non-commutative schemes. We then formulate
and prove an analog of Blanc's conjecture on the torsion part of this theory,
generalizing the work of Antieau and Heller.

implementable, scalable method for uncertainty quantification, however, it has
been criticised for not being Bayesian. This work proposes one modification to
the usual process that we argue does result in approximate Bayesian inference;
regularising parameters about values drawn from a distribution which can be set
equal to the prior. A theoretical analysis of the procedure in a simplified
setting suggests the recovered posterior is centred correctly but tends to have
an underestimated marginal variance, and overestimated correlation. However,
two conditions can lead to exact recovery. We argue that these conditions are
partially present in NNs. Empirical evaluations demonstrate it has an advantage
over standard ensembling, and is competitive with variational methods.

unsupervised feature learning and one-class classification for fault detection
that uses data on healthy conditions only for its training. The approach is

the approach is evaluated on a real case study of a power plant fault. The

achieved significant progress recently by using deep-learning neural networks,
especially the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Most of the existing works
are focused on classifying very clear natural images, evidenced by the widely
used image databases such as Caltech-256, PASCAL VOCs and ImageNet. However, in
many real applications, the acquired images may contain certain degradations
that lead to various kinds of blurring, noise, and distortions. One important
and interesting problem is the effect of such degradations to the performance
of CNN-based image classification. More specifically, we wonder whether
image-classification performance drops with each kind of degradation, whether
this drop can be avoided by including degraded images into training, and
whether existing computer vision algorithms that attempt to remove such
degradations can help improve the image-classification performance. In this
paper, we empirically study this problem for four kinds of degraded images --
hazy images, underwater images, motion-blurred images and fish-eye images. For
this study, we synthesize a large number of such degraded images by applying
respective physical models to the clear natural images and collect a new hazy
image dataset from the Internet. We expect this work can draw more interests
from the community to study the classification of degraded images.

radiation sources in the universe. Observations usually show near- to
mid-infrared (NIR--MIR, $\lambda\sim 1-5~\mu$m) emission excess from H\,{\sc
ii} regions around young massive star clusters (YMSCs). Early phase
observations in optical to NIR wavelengths of type Ia supernovae also reveal
unusual properties of dust extinction and dust polarization. The popular
explanation for such NIR-MIR excess and unusual dust properties is the
predominance of small grains (size $a\lesssim 0.05~\mu$m) relative to large
grains ($a\gtrsim 0.1~\mu$m) in the local environment of these strong radiation
sources. The question of why small grains are predominant in these environments
remains a mystery. Here we report a new mechanism of dust destruction based on
centrifugal stress within extremely fast-rotating grains spun-up by radiative
torques, which we term the RAdiative Torque Disruption (RATD) mechanism. We
find that RATD can disrupt large grains located within a distance of $\sim 1$
pc from a massive star of luminosity $L\sim 10^{4}L_{\odot}$ or a supernova.
This effect increases the abundance of small grains relative to large grains
and successfully reproduces the observed NIR-MIR excess and anomalous dust
extinction/polarization. We apply the RATD mechanism for kilonovae and find
that dust within $\sim$ 0.1 pc would be dominated by small grains. Small grains
produced by RATD can also explain the steep far-UV rise in extinction curves
toward starburst and high redshift galaxies, and the decrease of the escape
fraction of Ly$\alpha$ photons from H\,{\sc ii} regions surrounding YMSCs.

posterior distribution and an approximate lower bound of the model evidence,
useful for model selection. We demonstrate VBMC both on several synthetic
likelihoods and on a neuronal model with data from real neurons. Across all
tested problems and dimensions (up to $D = 10$), VBMC performs consistently
well in reconstructing the posterior and the model evidence with a limited
budget of likelihood evaluations, unlike other methods that work only in very
low dimensions. Our framework shows great promise as a novel tool for posterior
and model inference with expensive, black-box likelihoods.

the AdS/CFT correspondence and we show that it is realized by the `Spin Matrix

as non-relativistic limits of the AdS/CFT correspondence close to BPS bounds.
The duality between non-relativistic strings and Spin Matrix theory provides a

Motivated by analogy with photonic lattices, here we examine the edge states of
a one-dimensional trimer lattice in the phases with and without inversion
symmetry protection. In contrast to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we show
that the edge states in the inversion-symmetry broken phase of the trimer model
turn out to be chiral, i.e., instead of appearing in pairs localized at
opposite edges they can appear at a $\textit{single}$ edge. Interestingly,
these chiral edge states remain robust to large amounts of disorder. In
addition, we use the Zak phase to characterize the emergence of degenerate edge
states in the inversion-symmetric phase of the trimer model. Furthermore, we
capture the essentials of the whole family of trimers through a mapping onto
the commensurate off-diagonal Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model, which allow us to
establish a direct connection between chiral edge modes in the two models,
including the calculation of Chern numbers. We thus suggest that the chiral
edge modes of the trimer lattice have a topological origin inherited from this
effective mapping. Also, we find a nontrivial connection between the
topological phase transition point in the trimer lattice and the one in its
associated two-dimensional parent system, in agreement with results in the

the absence of labeled test datasets. In these scenarios we may need to rely on
a human oracle to evaluate individual predictions; presenting the challenge to
create query algorithms to guide the search for points that provide the most
information about the classifier's predictive characteristics. Previous works
have focused on developing utility models and query algorithms for discovering
unknown unknowns --- misclassifications with a predictive confidence above some
arbitrary threshold. However, if misclassifications occur at the rate reflected
by the confidence values, then these search methods reveal nothing more than a
proper assessment of predictive certainty. We are unable to properly mitigate
the risks associated with model deficiency when the model's confidence in
prediction exceeds the actual model accuracy. We propose a facility locations
utility model and corresponding greedy query algorithm that instead searches
for overconfident unknown unknowns. Through robust empirical experiments we
demonstrate that the greedy query algorithm with the facility locations utility
model consistently results in oracle queries with superior performance in
discovering overconfident unknown unknowns than previous methods.

new ways to study the discursive landscape of world politics. Here seen as
complementary to qualitative approaches, quantitative assessments have the
advantage of being able to order and make comprehensible vast amounts of text.
However, the validity of unsupervised methods applied to the types of text
available in large quantities needs to be established before they can speak to
other studies relying on text and discourse as data. In this paper, we
introduce a new text corpus of United Nations Security Council (UNSC) speeches
on Afghanistan between 2001 and 2017; we study this corpus through unsupervised
topic modeling (LDA) with the central aim to validate the topic categories that
the LDA identifies; and we discuss the added value, and complementarity, of
quantitative text-as-data approaches. We set-up two tests using mixed- method
approaches. Firstly, we evaluate the identified topics by assessing whether
they conform with previous qualitative work on the development of the situation
in Afghanistan. Secondly, we use network analysis to study the underlying
social structures of what we will call 'speaker-topic relations' to see whether
they correspondent to know divisions and coalitions in the UNSC. In both cases
we find that the unsupervised LDA indeed provides valid and valuable outputs.
In addition, the mixed-method approaches themselves reveal interesting patterns
deserving future qualitative research. Amongst these are the coalition and
dynamics around the 'women and human rights' topic as part of the UNSC debates
on Afghanistan.

multistationarity (two or more positive steady states with the same conserved

system is an effective question in real algebraic geometry, it is in general
difficult to determine whether a given network can give rise to a
multistationary system, and if so, to identify witnesses to multistationarity,
that is, specific parameter values for which the system exhibits multiple
steady states. Here we investigate both problems. First, we build on work of
Conradi, Feliu, Mincheva, and Wiuf, who showed that for certain reaction
networks whose steady states admit a positive parametrization,
multistationarity is characterized by whether a certain ""critical function""
changes sign. Here, we allow for more general parametrizations, which make it
much easier to determine the existence of a sign change. This is particularly
simple when the steady-state equations are linearly equivalent to binomials; we
give necessary conditions for this to happen, which hold for many networks
studied in the literature. We also give a sufficient condition for
multistationarity of networks whose steady-state equations can be replaced by
equivalent triangular-form equations. Finally, we present methods for finding
witnesses to multistationarity, which we show work well for certain structured
reaction networks, including those common to biological signaling pathways. Our
work relies on results from degree theory, on the existence of explicit
rational parametrizations of the steady states, and on the specialization of
Groebner bases.

lagged behind. Here, we analyze how joining networks (e.g., cross-talk) or
decomposing networks (e.g., inhibition or knock-outs) affects three properties
that reaction networks may possess---identifiability (recoverability of
parameter values from data), steady-state invariants (relationships among
species concentrations at steady state, used in model selection), and
multistationarity (capacity for multiple steady states, which correspond to
multiple cell decisions). Specifically, we prove results that clarify, for a
network obtained by joining two smaller networks, how properties of the smaller

effective field theory (EFT) to describe the scattering cross section. In
agreement with previous literature, we show that an increased maximum energy
leads to more stringent upper bounds on the DM-nucleus cross section for the
EFT operators, especially those with an explicit momentum dependence. In this
article we extend the energy region of interest (ROI) to show that the optimal
values of the maximum energy for xenon and argon are of the order of 500 keV
and 300 keV, respectively. We then show how, if a signal compatible with DM is
observed, an enlarged energy ROI leads to a better measurement of the DM mass
and couplings. In particular, for a xenon detector, DM masses of the order of
200 GeV (2 TeV) or lower can be reconstructed for momentum-independent
(-dependent) operators. We also investigate three-dimensional parameter
reconstruction and apply it to the specific case of scalar DM and anapole DM.
We find that opening the energy ROI is an excellent way to identify the linear
combination of momentum-dependent and momentum-independent operators, and it is
crucial to correctly distinguish these models. Finally, we show how an enlarged

speedups correspond to problems related to simulation of quantum systems and
cryptography. Here we apply general-purpose quantum algorithms for solving
constraint satisfaction problems to two families of prototypical NP-complete
problems: boolean satisfiability and graph colouring. We consider two quantum
approaches: Grover's algorithm and a quantum algorithm for accelerating
backtracking algorithms. We compare the performance of optimised versions of
these algorithms, when applied to random problem instances, against leading
classical algorithms. Even when considering only problem instances that can be
solved within one day, we find that there are potentially large quantum
speedups available. In the most optimistic parameter regime we consider, this
could be a factor of over $10^5$ relative to a classical desktop computer; in
the least optimistic regime, the speedup is reduced to a factor of over $10^3$.
However, the number of physical qubits used is extremely large, and improved
fault-tolerance methods will likely be needed to make these results practical.
In particular, the quantum advantage disappears if one includes the cost of the

sequence of customer types to arrive over time is arbitrary and completely
unknown.
  We overcome both the challenges of model uncertainty and customer
heterogeneity by judiciously synthesizing two algorithmic frameworks from the
literature: inventory balancing, which ""reserves"" a portion of each resource
for high-reward customer types which could later arrive, and online learning,
which shows how to ""explore"" the resource consumption distributions of each
customer type under different actions. We define an auxiliary problem, which
allows for existing competitive ratio and regret bounds to be seamlessly
integrated. Furthermore, we show that the performance guarantee generated by
our framework is tight, that is, we provide an information-theoretic lower
bound which shows that both the loss from competitive ratio and the loss for
regret are relevant in the combined problem.
  Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms on a publicly
available hotel data set. Our framework is highly practical in that it requires
no historical data (no fitted customer choice models, nor forecasting of
customer arrival patterns) and can be used to initialize allocation strategies
in fast-changing environments.

InfiNet consists of double encoder arms for T1 and T2 input scans that feed
into a joint-decoder arm that terminates in the classification layer. The
novelty of InfiNet lies in the manner in which the decoder upsamples lower
resolution input feature map(s) from multiple encoder arms. Specifically, the
pooled indices computed in the max-pooling layers of each of the encoder blocks
are related to the corresponding decoder block to perform non-linear
learning-free upsampling. The sparse maps are concatenated with intermediate
encoder representations (skip connections) and convolved with trainable filters
to produce dense feature maps. InfiNet is trained end-to-end to optimize for
the Generalized Dice Loss, which is well-suited for high class imbalance.
InfiNet achieves the whole-volume segmentation in under 50 seconds and we

forces of interest are evaluated numerically from integral expressions obtained
utilizing general scaling arguments and mean-field type calculations in
combination with the so-called ""surface integration approach"" (SIA). Within the
scenario considered here, this technique is applicable if one has knowledge of
the forces between two parallel semi-infinite plates, confining in between some
fluctuating fluid medium characterized by its temperature $T$ and chemical
potential $\mu$. It is demonstrated that for a suitable set of particle-fluid,
slab-fluid, and fluid-fluid coupling parameters the competition between the
effects due to the coatings and the core regions of the objects result, when
one changes $T$ or $\mu$, in {\it sign change} of the NF acting between the
ellipsoid and the slab.

(waiting) time statistics of wind is far from well understood. Here, we
investigate the statistics of both high- and low-wind persistence. We find

Persistent wind conditions are not necessarily caused by stationary atmospheric

as a combination of multiple weather types and circulation patterns.
Understanding wind persistence statistically and synoptically, may help to
ensure a reliable and economically feasible future energy system, which uses a

character of higher gradient theories, in which the strain or distortion
gradients are considered as the fundamental measures of deformation. Contrary
to common belief, the first or higher strain or distortion gradients are not
proper measures of deformation. Consequently, their corresponding energetically
conjugate stresses are non-physical and cannot represent the state of internal
stresses in the continuum. Furthermore, the governing equations in these
theories do not describe the motion of infinitesimal elements of matter
consistently. For example, in first strain gradient theory, there are nine
governing equations of motion for infinitesimal elements of matter at each
point; three force equations, and six unsubstantiated artificial moment
equations that violate Newton's third law of action and reaction and the
angular momentum theorem. This shows that the first strain gradient theory
(F-SGT) is not an extension of rigid body mechanics, which then is not
recovered in the absence of deformation. The inconsistencies of F-SGT and other
higher gradient theories also manifest themselves in the appearance of strains,
distortions or their gradients as boundary conditions and the requirement for
many material coefficients in the constitutive relations.

targets set for the near future, the management of large EV fleets must be seen
as a priority. Specifically, we study a scenario where EV charging is managed
through self-interested EV aggregators who compete in the day-ahead market in
order to purchase the electricity needed to meet their clients' requirements.
With the aim of reducing electricity costs and lowering the impact on
electricity markets, a centralised bidding coordination framework has been
proposed in the literature employing a coordinator. In order to improve privacy
and limit the need for the coordinator, we propose a reformulation of the
coordination framework as a decentralised algorithm, employing the Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). However, given the self-interested
nature of the aggregators, they can deviate from the algorithm in order to
reduce their energy costs. Hence, we study the strategic manipulation of the
ADMM algorithm and, in doing so, describe and analyse different possible attack
vectors and propose a mathematical framework to quantify and detect
manipulation. Importantly, this detection framework is not limited the
considered EV scenario and can be applied to general ADMM algorithms. Finally,
we test the proposed decentralised coordination and manipulation detection
algorithms in realistic scenarios using real market and driver data from Spain.
Our empirical results show that the decentralised algorithm's convergence to
the optimal solution can be effectively disrupted by manipulative attacks
achieving convergence to a different non-optimal solution which benefits the
attacker. With respect to the detection algorithm, results indicate that it
achieves very high accuracies and significantly outperforms a naive benchmark.

usually larger than the sample under study, and contact techniques may alter
the sample temperature itself. Many photostable nanomaterials whose
luminescence is temperature-dependent, such as lanthanide-doped phosphors, have
been shown to be good non-contact thermometric sensors when optically excited.
Using such nanomaterials, in this work we accomplished the key milestone of
enabling far-field thermometry with a spatial resolution that is not
diffraction-limited at readout.
  We explore thermal effects on the cathodoluminescence of lanthanide-doped
NaYF$_4$ nanoparticles. Whereas cathodoluminescence from such lanthanide-doped
nanomaterials has been previously observed, here we use quantitative features
of such emission for the first time towards an application beyond localization.
We demonstrate a thermometry scheme that is based on cathodoluminescence
lifetime changes as a function of temperature that achieves $\sim$ 30 mK
sensitivity in sub-$\mu$m nanoparticle patches. The scheme is robust against
spurious effects related to electron beam radiation damage and optical
alignment fluctuations.
  We foresee the potential of single nanoparticles, of sheets of nanoparticles,
and also of thin films of lanthanide-doped NaYF$_4$ to yield temperature
information via cathodoluminescence changes when in the vicinity of a sample of
interest; the phosphor may even protect the sample from direct contact to
damaging electron beam radiation. Cathodoluminescence-based thermometry is thus
a valuable novel tool towards temperature monitoring at the nanoscale, with
broad applications including heat dissipation in miniaturized electronics and
biological diagnostics.

Currently, the main route for NH3 synthesis is via the heterogeneous catalytic
Haber-Bosch process (N2+3H2 - 2NH3), which proceeds under extreme conditions of
temperature and pressure with a very large carbon footprint. Herein we report
that a pristine nitrogen-doped nanoporous graphitic carbon membrane (NCM) can
electrochemically convert N2 into NH3 in an aqueous acidic solution under
ambient conditions. The Faradaic efficiency and rate of production of NH3 on
the NCM electrode reach 5.2% and 0.08 g m-2 h-1, respectively. After
functionalization of the NCM with Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) these performance
metrics are dramatically enhanced to 22% and 0.36 g m-2 h-1, respectively.
These efficiencies and rates for the production of NH3 at room temperature and
atmospheric pressure are unprecedented. As this system offers the potential to
be scaled to industrial proportions there is a high likelihood it might
displace the century old Haber-Bosch process.

successful characterization techniques used to characterize complex hysteretic
phenomena not only in magnetism, but also in other areas of science like in
ferroelectricity, geology, archeology, light-induced and pressure hysteresis in
spin-transition materials, etc. Because the definition of the FORC diagram
involves a second-order derivative, the main problem in their numerical
calculation is that the derivative of a function for which only discrete
noise-contaminated data values are available magnifies the noise that is
inevitably present in measurements. In this paper we present doFORC tool for
calculating FORC diagrams of noise scattered data. It can provide both a smooth
approximation of the measured magnetization and all its partial derivatives.
doFORC is a free, portable application working on various operating systems,
with an easy to use graphical interface, with four regression methods
implemented to obtain a smooth approximation of the data which may then be
differentiated to obtain approximations for derivatives. In order to perform
the diagnostics and goodness of fit doFORC computes residuals to characterize
the difference between observed and predicted values, generalized
cross-validation to measure the predictive performance, two information
criteria to quantify the information that is lost by using an approximate
model, and three degrees of freedom to compare different amounts of smoothing
being performed by different smoothing methods. Based on these doFORC can
perform automatic smoothing parameter selection.

  2-D classification in single particle reconstruction",,,,,"eess.IV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motivated by the task of 2-D classification in single particle reconstruction
by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we consider the problem of heterogeneous
multireference alignment of images. In this problem, the goal is to estimate a
(typically small) set of target images from a (typically large) collection of
observations. Each observation is a rotated, noisy version of one of the target
images. For each individual observation, neither the rotation nor which target
image has been rotated are known. As the noise level in cryo-EM data is high,
clustering the observations and estimating individual rotations is challenging.
We propose a framework to estimate the target images directly from the
observations, completely bypassing the need to cluster or register the images.
The framework consists of two steps. First, we estimate rotation-invariant
features of the images, such as the bispectrum. These features can be estimated
to any desired accuracy, at any noise level, provided sufficiently many
observations are collected. Then, we estimate the images from the invariant
features. Numerical experiments on synthetic cryo-EM datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the method. Ultimately, we outline future developments
required to apply this method to experimental data.

its harmless treatment is of great importance for the protection of our aquatic
ecosystems. Membrane filtration is highly desirable for removing oil from oily
water because it has the advantages of energy efficiency, easy processing and
low maintenance cost. However, membrane fouling during filtration leads to
severe flux decline and impedes long-term operation of membranes in practical
wastewater treatment. Membrane fouling includes reversible fouling and
irreversible fouling. The fouling mechanisms have been explored based on
classical fouling models, and on oil droplet behaviors (such as droplet
deposition, accumulation, coalescence and wetting) on the membranes. Membrane
fouling is dominated by droplet-membrane interaction, which is influenced by
the properties of the membrane (e.g., surface chemistry, structure and charge)
and the wastewater (e.g., compositions and concentrations) as well as the
operation conditions. Typical membrane antifouling strategies, such as surface
hydrophilization, zwitterionic polymer coating, photocatalytic decomposition
and electrically enhanced antifouling are reviewed, and their cons and pros for
practical applications are discussed.
