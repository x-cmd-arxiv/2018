Network (RNN) models of Natural Language Inference (NLI). However, dropout has
not been evaluated for the effectiveness at different layers and dropout rates
in NLI models. In this paper, we propose a novel RNN model for NLI and
empirically evaluate the effect of applying dropout at different layers in the
model. We also investigate the impact of varying dropout rates at these layers.
Our empirical evaluation on a large (Stanford Natural Language Inference
(SNLI)) and a small (SciTail) dataset suggest that dropout at each feed-forward
connection severely affects the model accuracy at increasing dropout rates. We
also show that regularizing the embedding layer is efficient for SNLI whereas
regularizing the recurrent layer improves the accuracy for SciTail. Our model
achieved an accuracy 86.14% on the SNLI dataset and 77.05% on SciTail.

the effects of both mean grain size and grain size distribution on the
dielectric properties of lead-free Ba0.85Ca0.15Ti0.9Zr0.1O3 (BCZT)
ferroelectric relaxors, an original method was proposed. It is based on the
surfactant-assisted solvothermal processing coupled with low-temperature
conventional sintering at 1250 {\deg}C. In this way, three highly dense BCZT
with different mean grain size and dissimilar grain size distribution were
designed. A significant increase of dielectric properties was obtained by a
control of grain size and densification process. The dielectric constants
measured were ranged from 5370 to 9646 and the dielectric loss was enhanced by
70%. Surprisingly, it was evidenced that there is unequivocal link between mean
grain size with dielectric properties. Indeed, it was found that the presence
of high density of refined grains leads to an improvement of dielectric
properties due to an enhancement of densification. This work may provide a new
strategy to design ferroelectric materials with enhanced properties.

biparavectors representing line segments are the result of the product of

Several methods have been explored to cope with this problem, based on the
principle of adaptively estimating the density by a simpler function, using the

for $\sim12$ years, exhibiting a wide range of variability on various
timescales, before entering quiescence after two short-lived, low-luminosity
""mini-outbursts"" in April 2017. The unusually long outburst duration in such a
short-period ($P_{\rm orb}\approx3.24$ hrs) source, and complex variability
observed during this outburst period, challenges the predictions of the widely
accepted disc-instability model, which has been shown to broadly reproduce the
behaviour of LMXB systems well. The long-term behaviour observed in J1753 is
reminiscent of the Z Cam class of dwarf novae, whereby variable mass transfer
from the companion star drives unusual outbursts, characterized by stalled
decays and abrupt changes in luminosity. Using sophisticated modelling of the
multi-wavelength light curves and spectra of J1753, during the $\sim12$ years
the source was active, we investigate the hypothesis that periods of enhanced
mass transfer from the companion star may have driven this unusually long
outburst. Our modelling suggests that J1753 is in fact a BH-LMXB analogue to Z
Cam systems, where the variable mass transfer from the companion star is driven
by the changing irradiation properties of the system, affecting both the disc
and companion star.

One advantage lies in the possibility to operate the main detectors with looser

systematic nuisances that will be present in future proton runs, such as the

overlap with the volume of the cycle wrapped by the orientifold. This extends
our previous results in the volume-dilaton subspace to a semi-universal
modulus. Emboldened by this and other observations, we investigate what it
means to have a bound on (generalized) slow roll in a multi-field landscape. We
argue that for $any$ point $\phi_0$ in an $N$-dimensional field space with
$V(\phi_0) > 0$, there exists a path of monotonically decreasing potential
energy to a point $\phi_1$ within a path length $\lesssim {\cal O}(1)$, such
that $\sqrt{N}\ln \frac{V(\phi_1)}{V(\phi_0)} \lesssim - {\cal O} (1)$. The
previous de Sitter swampland bounds are specific ways to realize this stringent
non-local constraint on field space, but we show that it also incorporates (for
example) the scenario where both slow roll parameters are intermediate-valued
and the Universe undergoes a small number of e-folds, as in the Type IIA set up
of arXiv:1310.8300. Our observations are in the context of tree level
constructions, so we take the conservative viewpoint that it is a
characterization of the classical ""boundary"" of the string landscape. To
emphasize this, we argue that these bounds can be viewed as a type of
Dine-Seiberg statement.

to actively identify humans in hazard zones. The sensors' response time and
memory requirement is substantially improved by quantizing and pipelining the
inference of a convolutional neural network. In this way, convolutional neural

overcome this problem, we introduce a new design concept for implementing
photonic EPs that combine the robustness required for practical use together

a hypersurface of Jordan EPs (JEPs) embedded in a larger space, and having the
following peculiar features: (1) A large class of undesired perturbations shift
the operating point along the exceptional surface (ES), thus leaving the system
at another EP which explains the robustness; (2) Perturbations due to back
reflection/scattering force the operating point out of the ES, leading to
enhanced sensitivity. Importantly, our proposed geometry is relatively easy to
implement using standard photonics components and the design concept can be

been modified primarily by stars. Observations of 3He+ in HII regions located
throughout the Milky Way disk reveal very little variation in the 3He/H

production in stars is negligible. This is in contrast to much higher 3He/H
abundance ratios found in some planetary nebulae. This discrepancy is known as
the ""3He Problem"". Stellar evolution models that include thermohaline mixing
can resolve the 3He Problem by drastically reducing the net 3He production in
most stars. These models predict a small negative 3He/H abundance gradient
across the Galactic disk. Here we use the Green Bank Telescope to observe 3He+
in five HII regions with high accuracy to confirm the predictions of stellar

detect 3He+ in all the sources and derive the 3He+/H+ abundance ratio using
model HII regions and the numerical radiative transfer code NEBULA. The over 35
radio recombination lines (RRLs) that are simultaneously observed, together
with the 3He+ transition provide stringent constraints for these models. We
apply an ionization correction using observations of 4He RRLs. We determine a
3He/H abundance gradient as a function of Galactocentric radius of -0.116 +/-
0.022 x 10-5, consistent with stellar evolution models including thermohaline

such that $G$ admits a $k$-coloring of its vertex set in such a way that each
color class is an independent set (a set of pairwise non-adjacent vertices).
The dichromatic number of a digraph $D$, denoted by $\chi_A(D)$, is the minimum
$k$ such that $D$ admits a $k$-coloring of its vertex set in such a way that
each color class is acyclic.
  In 1976, Bondy proved that the chromatic number of a digraph $D$ is at most
its circumference, the length of a longest cycle.
  Given a digraph $D$, we will construct three different graphs whose chromatic
numbers bound $\chi_A(D)$.

r_s$ with $k\geq r_i\geq 0$ and $r_i\neq 1$ for each $i\in[s]$, that if all
cycles in $D$ have length $r$ modulo $k$ for some $r\in\{r_1,\ldots,r_s\}$,
then $\chi_A(D)\leq 2s+1$; ii) if $D$ has girth $g$ and there are integers $k$
and $p$, with $k\geq g-1\geq p\geq 1$ such that $D$ contains no cycle of length
$r$ modulo $\lceil \frac{k}{p} \rceil p$ for each $r\in
\{-p+2,\ldots,0,\ldots,p\}$, then $\chi_A (D)\leq \lceil \frac{k}{p} \rceil$;
iii) if $D$ has girth $g$, the length of a shortest cycle, and circumference
$c$, then $\chi_A(D)\leq \lceil \frac{c-1}{g-1} \rceil +1$, which improves,
substantially, the bound proposed by Bondy. Our results show that if we have
more information about the lengths of cycles in a digraph, then we can improve
the bounds for the dichromatic number known until now.

Research 1, 033062 (2019)","10.1103/PhysRevResearch.1.033062",,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), a variational algorithm to obtain
an approximated ground state of a given Hamiltonian, is an appealing
application of near-term quantum computers. The original work [A. Peruzzo et
al.; \textit{Nat. Commun.}; \textbf{5}, 4213 (2014)] focused only on finding a
ground state, whereas the excited states can also induce interesting phenomena
in molecules and materials. Calculating excited states is, in general, a more
difficult task than finding ground states for classical computers. To extend
the framework to excited states, we here propose an algorithm, the
subspace-search variational quantum eigensolver (SSVQE). This algorithm
searches a low energy subspace by supplying orthogonal input states to the
variational ansatz and relies on the unitarity of transformations to ensure the
orthogonality of output states. The $k$-th excited state is obtained as the
highest energy state in the low energy subspace. The proposed algorithm
consists only of two parameter optimization procedures and does not employ any
ancilla qubits. The disuse of the ancilla qubits is a great improvement from
the existing proposals for excited states, which have utilized the swap test,
making our proposal a truly near-term quantum algorithm. We further generalize
the SSVQE to obtain all excited states up to the $k$-th by only a single
optimization procedure. From numerical simulations, we verify the proposed
algorithms. This work greatly extends the applicable domain of the VQE to
excited states and their related properties like a transition amplitude without
sacrificing any feasibility of it.

evolved binary systems. The interaction of the binary components during the CE
evolution (CEE) stage gives rise to orbital inspiral and the formation of a
short-period binary or a merger, on the expense of extending and/or ejecting
the envelope. CEE is not well understood, as hydrodynamical simulations show
that only a fraction of the CE-mass is ejected during the dynamical inspiral,
in contrast with observations of post-CE binaries. Different CE models suggest
different timescales are involved in the CE-ejection, and hence a measurement
of the CE-ejection timescale could provide direct constraints on the
CEE-process. Here we propose a novel method for constraining the mass-loss
timescale of the CE, using post-CE binaries which are part of wide-orbit triple
systems. The orbit/existence of a third companion constrains the CE mass-loss
timescale, since rapid CE mass-loss may disrupt the triple system, while slower
CE mass-loss may change the orbit of the third companion without disrupting it.
As first test-cases we examine two observed post-CE binaries in wide triples,
Wolf-1130 and GD-319. We follow their evolution due to mass-loss using analytic
and numerical tools, and consider different mass-loss functions. We calculate a
wide grid of binary parameters and mass-loss timescales in order to determine
the most probable mass-loss timescale leading to the observed properties of the
systems. We find that mass-loss timescales of the order of $10^{3}-10^{5}{\rm
yr}$ are the most likely to explain these systems. Such long timescales are in
tension with most of the CE mass-loss models, which predict shorter, dynamical
timescales, but are potentially consistent with the longer timescales expected
from the dust-driven winds model for CE ejection.

ultra-compact dense dark matter clumps present in the Milky Way with

consistent and competitive with that derived from cluster catalogues selected

probes analyses by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Kilo-Degree Survey

insights on these enigmatic sources. We show that the nearly 100% linear
polarization and small variation of the polarization position angles (PAs) of
multiple bursts from the same source suggest that the radiation is produced
near the surface of a strongly magnetized neutron star. As the emitted
radiation travels through the magnetosphere, the electric vector of the X-mode
wave adiabatically rotates and stays perpendicular to the local magnetic field
direction. The PA freezes at a radius where the plasma density becomes too
small to be able to turn the electric vector. At the freeze-out radius, the
electric field is perpendicular to the magnetic dipole moment of the neutron
star projected in the plane of the sky, independent of the radiation mechanism
or the orientation of the magnetic field in the emission region. We discuss a
number of predictions of the model. The variation of PAs from repeating FRBs
should follow the rotational period of the underlying neutron star (but the
burst occurrence may not be periodic). Measuring this period will provide
crucial support for the neutron star nature of the progenitors of FRBs. For FRB
121102, the small range of PA variation means that the magnetic inclination
angle is less than about 20 degrees and that the observer's line of sight is
outside the magnetic inclination cone. Other repeating FRBs may have a
different range of PA variation from that of FRB 121102, depending on the
magnetic inclination and the observer's viewing angle.

Combining a Toomre-Q-dependent local star formation efficiency per free-fall
time with a model for delayed feedback, we are able to match the normalization
and scatter of resolved star formation scaling relations. In particular, this
simple model suggests that large ($\sim$dex) variations in star formation rates
(SFRs) on kiloparsec scales may be due to the fact that supernova feedback is
not instantaneous following star formation. The scatter in SFRs at constant gas
surface density in a galaxy then depends on the properties of feedback and when
we observe its star-forming regions at various points throughout their
collapse/star formation ""cycles"". This has the following important
observational consequences: (1) the scatter and normalization of the
Kennicutt-Schmidt relation are relatively insensitive to the local
(small-scale) star formation efficiency, (2) but gas depletion times and
velocity dispersions are; (3) the scatter in and normalization of the
Kennicutt-Schmidt relation is a sensitive probe of the feedback timescale and
strength; (4) even in a model where $\tilde Q_{\rm gas}$ deterministically
dictates star formation locally, time evolution, variation in local conditions
(e.g., gas fractions and dynamical times), and variations between galaxies can
destroy much of the observable correlation between SFR and $\tilde Q_{\rm gas}$
in resolved galaxy surveys. Additionally, this model exhibits large scatter in
SFRs at low gas surface densities, in agreement with observations of flat outer
HI disk velocity dispersion profiles.

leaps in sensitivity of CMB experiments is the polarized Sunyaev Zel'dovich
(pSZ) effect, small-scale CMB polarization anisotropies induced by scattering
from free electrons in the post-reionization Universe. The cross correlation of
the pSZ effect with galaxy surveys, a technique known as pSZ tomography, can be
used to reconstruct the remote quadrupole field: the CMB quadrupole observed
from different locations in the Universe. Primordial gravitational waves leave
a distinct imprint on the remote quadrupole field, making pSZ tomography a
potential new method to characterize their properties. Building on previous
work, we explore the utility of the full set of correlations between the
primary CMB and the reconstructed remote quadrupole field to both provide
exclusion limits on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves, as well as
to provide constraints on several phenomenological models of the tensor sector:
axion gauge field inflation, general models with chiral tensors, and models
with modified late-time decay of tensors. We find that relatively futuristic
experimental requirements are necessary to provide competitive exclusion limits
compared with the primary CMB. However, pSZ tomography can be a powerful probe
of the late-time evolution of tensors and, through cross-correlations with the
primary CMB, can provide mild improvements on parameter constraints in various

likely due to accreting supermassive black holes. These 12 AGN candidates have
low intrinsic X-ray luminosities, with a median value of $7 \times10^{40}$ erg
s$^{-1}$. They are generally not heavily obscured, with an average effective
power-law photon index of 1.8. The fraction of variable AGNs in the CDF-S is
independent of X-ray luminosity and is only restricted by the total number of
observed net counts, confirming previous findings that X-ray variability is a
near-ubiquitous property of AGNs over a wide range of luminosities. There is an
anti-correlation between X-ray luminosity and variability amplitude for
high-luminosity AGNs, but as the luminosity drops to $\lesssim 10^{42}$ erg

acceleration emerges from the dark matter superfluid framework. The system is
described by a superfluid mixture consisting of two distinguishable states with
a small energy gap, such as the ground state and an excited state of dark
matter. Given their contact in the superfluid, interaction between those states
can happen, converting one state into the other. This long range interaction
within the superfluid couples the two superfluid phonon species through a
cosine potential motivated by Josephson/Rabi interactions. As a consequence of
this potential, a new dynamics of late-time accelerated expansion emerges in
this system, without the need of dark energy, coming from a universe containing
only this two-state DM superfluid. Because the superfluid species are
non-relativistic, their sound speeds remain suitably small throughout the
evolution. We calculate the expansion history and growth of linear
perturbations, and compare the results to $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. For the
fiducial parameters studied here, the predicted expansion and growth function
are close to those of $\Lambda$CDM, but the difference in the predicted growth
rate is significant at late times. The present theory nicely complements the
recent proposal of dark matter superfluidity to explain the empirical success
of MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) on galactic scales, thus offering a
unified framework for dark matter, dark energy, and MOND phenomenology.

gauge}$ from the space of skeleton-reduced graphs in the connected $n$-point
function of gauge theory. This moduli space is a proper subset of ${\cal
M}_{g,n}$ stratified by the genus, and its top component gives a simple
triangulation of $\Sigma_{g,n}$.

Here, we study exceptional points in the context of the counterflow instability

times and are amenable to optical control schemes, have long been explored as
building blocks for qubit architectures. One such design consists of vertically
stacking two QDs to create a quantum dot molecule (QDM) and using the
spin-mixing properties of ""molecule-like"" coupled hole states for all-optical
qubit manipulation. In this article, the first of two papers, we introduce the
incorporation of dilute GaBiAs alloys in the barrier region between the two
dots. GaBiAs is expected to increase the spin-mixing of the molecular states
needed for qubit operations by raising the barrier valence band edge and
spin-orbit splitting. Using an atomistic tight-binding model, we compute the
properties of GaBiAs and the modification of hole states that arise when the
alloy is used in the barrier of an InAs QDM. An atomistic treatment is
necessary to correctly capture non-traditional alloy effects such as the
band-anticrossing valence band. It also allows for the study of configurational
variances and clustering effects of the alloy. We find that in InAs QDMs with a
GaBiAs interdot barrier, electron states are not strongly affected by the
inclusion of Bi. However, hole states are much more sensitive to the presence
and configuration of Bi in the barriers. By independently studying the
alloy-induced strain and electronic scattering off Bi and As orbitals, we
conclude that an initial increase in QDM hole state energy at low Bi
concentration is caused by the alloy-induced strain. We further find that the
decrease in QDM hole energy at higher Bi concentrations can only be explained
when both alloy strain and orbital effects are considered. In our second
article, we use the understanding developed here to discuss how the alloyed
barriers contribute to enhancement in hole spin-mixing and the implications for
QDM qubit architectures.

for problems like the Paige regression in which neutrality plays a minor role,
the advantage of the preferential selection of larger solutions can be extended

  Objectives: To compare the diagnostic accuracy obtained by using content
based image retrieval (CBIR) to retrieve visually similar dermatoscopic images
with corresponding disease labels against predictions made by a neural network.
  Methods: A neural network was trained to predict disease classes on
dermatoscopic images from three retrospectively collected image datasets
containing 888, 2750 and 16691 images respectively. Diagnosis predictions were
made based on the most commonly occurring diagnosis in visually similar images,
or based on the top-1 class prediction of the softmax output from the network.
Outcome measures were area under the ROC curve for predicting a malignant
lesion (AUC), multiclass-accuracy and mean average precision (mAP), measured on
unseen test images of the corresponding dataset.
  Results: In all three datasets the skin cancer predictions from CBIR
(evaluating the 16 most similar images) showed AUC values similar to softmax
predictions (0.842, 0.806 and 0.852 versus 0.830, 0.810 and 0.847 respectively;
p-value>0.99 for all). Similarly, the multiclass-accuracy of CBIR was
comparable to softmax predictions. Networks trained for detecting only 3
classes performed better on a dataset with 8 classes when using CBIR as
compared to softmax predictions (mAP 0.184 vs. 0.368 and 0.198 vs. 0.403
respectively).
  Conclusions: Presenting visually similar images based on features from a
neural network shows comparable accuracy to the softmax probability-based
diagnoses of convolutional neural networks. CBIR may be more helpful than a
softmax classifier in improving diagnostic accuracy of clinicians in a routine
clinical setting.

different behaviour than the purely acoustic RDIs. The dust organizes into
coherent structures and the system exhibits strong dust-gas separation. In the
linear and early nonlinear regime, the growth rates agree with linear theory
and the dust self-organizes into two-dimensional planes or ""sheets."" Eventually
the gas develops fully nonlinear, saturated Alfv\'enic and compressible
fast-mode turbulence, which fills the under-dense regions with a small amount
of dust, and drives a dynamo which saturates at equipartition of kinetic and
magnetic energy. The dust density fluctuations exhibit significant
non-Gaussianity, and the power spectrum is strongly weighted towards the
largest (box-scale) modes. The saturation level can be understood via
quasi-linear theory, as the forcing and energy input via the instabilities
becomes comparable to saturated tension forces and dissipation in turbulence.
The magnetized simulation presented here is just one case; it is likely that
the magnetic RDIs can take many forms in different parts of parameter space.

patients with similar joint data distributions. The flexibility of our approach
yields predictions that capture the joint data distribution better than
commonly used zero-inflated methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model

causal effect estimates that are robust to such data pathologies. Uncertainty
at all levels of this model flow through to the causal effect estimates of
interest - allowing easy point estimation, interval estimation, and posterior

that the strong tetrahedral clustering renders the atomic Mott picture
ineffective, and that the resulting MO picture is essential to describe the

qualitatively described by the truncation of the Hilbert space down to the

on a sequence of $n$ independent observations with piecewise constant means has
been intensively studied for more than half century, and serves as a blueprint
for change point problems in more complex settings. We provide a complete
characterization of this classical problem in a general framework in which the
upper bound $\sigma^2$ on the noise variance, the minimal spacing $\Delta$
between two consecutive change points and the minimal magnitude $\kappa$ of the
changes, are allowed to vary with $n$. We first show that consistent
localization of the change points, when the signal-to-noise ratio $\frac{\kappa
\sqrt{\Delta}}{\sigma} < \sqrt{\log(n)}$, is impossible. In contrast, when
$\frac{\kappa \sqrt{\Delta}}{\sigma}$ diverges with $n$ at the rate of at least
$\sqrt{\log(n)}$, we demonstrate that two computationally-efficient change
point estimators, one based on the solution to an $\ell_0$-penalized least
squares problem and the other on the popular wild binary segmentation
algorithm, are both consistent and achieve a localization rate of the order
$\frac{\sigma^2}{\kappa^2} \log(n)$. We further show that such rate is minimax
optimal, up to a $\log(n)$ term.

while its present position, as derived from the Gaia astrometry, is at $\sim
3.5$ kpc below the Galactic plane. Integration of the stellar Galactic motion
shows that SB 796 oscillates at a range of 0.5--20 kpc Galacto-centric

~400k SDSS galaxies with GALEX and WISE photometry, including 13,592 quiescent

Alternately, one can enforce a non-zero tensor value via a Lagrange multiplier.
The present work explores the relationship between these two types of theories
in the case of vector models. In particular, the na\""ive expectation that a
Lagrange multiplier ""kills off"" one degree of freedom via its constraint does
not necessarily hold for vector models that already contain primary

the transportation of injured people to emergency treatment facilities. For
this purpose, a scenario-based methodology is developed to model the
performance of a transportation network immediately following an earthquake

destination, irrational behavior of drivers, unavailability of traffic

building debris. An illustration using the road network of Tangshan City, China
shows that the method can capture the traffic flow characteristics immediately

low-energy regime, control the thermal and transport properties of materials,
from heat capacity to heat conduction, electron-phonon couplings, conventional
superconductivity etc. The old Debye model of vibrational spectra at low energy
gives the vibrational density of states (VDOS) as proportional to the frequency
squared, but in many materials the spectrum departs from this law which results
in a peak upon normalizing the VDOS by frequency squared, which is known as the
""boson peak"". A description of the VDOS of solids (both crystals and glasses)
is presented starting from first principles. Without using any assumptions
whatsoever about the existence and nature of ""disorder"" in the material, it is
shown that the boson peak in the VDOS of both ordered crystals and glasses
arises naturally from the competition between elastic mode propagation and
viscous damping. The theory explains the recent experimental observations of
boson peak in perfectly ordered crystals, which cannot be explained based on
previous theoretical frameworks. The theory also explains, for the first time,
how the vibrational spectrum changes with the atomic density of the solid, and
explains recent experimental observations of this effect.

interest in condensed matter physics. These modes reflect an oscillation in the
amplitude of a complex order parameter, yet are typically unstable and decay
into oscillations of the order parameter's phase. This renders stable amplitude
modes rare, and exotic effects in quantum antiferromagnets have historically
provided a realm for their detection. Here we report an alternate route to
realizing amplitude modes in magnetic materials by demonstrating that an
antiferromagnet on a two-dimensional anisotropic triangular lattice
($\alpha$-Na$_{0.9}$MnO$_2$) exhibits a long-lived, coherent oscillation of its
staggered magnetization field. Our results show that geometric frustration of
Heisenberg spins with uniaxial single-ion anisotropy can renormalize the
interactions of a dense two-dimensional network of moments into largely
decoupled, one-dimensional chains that manifest a longitudinally polarized
bound state. This bound state is driven by the Ising-like anisotropy inherent
to the Mn$^{3+}$ ions of this compound.

prestellar core mass function (CMF) can be well fit by a log-normal form. The
high-mass end of the prestellar CMF shows a power-law form with an index
$\alpha=-0.9\pm 0.1$ that is shallower than that of the Galactic field stellar
mass function. Combining the mass transformation efficiency ($\varepsilon$)
from the prestellar core to the star of $15\pm 1\%$ and the core formation
efficiency (CFE) of 5.5\%, we suggest an overall star formation efficiency of
about 1\% in the CMC. In the single-pointing observations with the IRAM 30m

red-skewed profile. [$\rm {HCO}^{+}$]/[HNC] and [$\rm {HCO}^{+}$]/$\rm

the temperature field of a fluid and the temperature of small particles

we investigate this variegated interaction at the different scales of the flow.
We find that the variance of the fluid temperature gradients decreases as the
thermal response time of the suspended particles is increased. The probability
density function (PDF) of the fluid temperature gradients scales with its
variance, while the PDF of the rate of change of the particle temperature,
whose variance is associated with the thermal dissipation due to the particles,
does not scale in such a self-similar way. The modification of the fluid
temperature field due to the particles is examined by computing the particle
concentration and particle heat fluxes conditioned on the magnitude of the
local fluid temperature gradient. These statistics highlight that the particles
cluster on the fluid temperature fronts, and the important role played by the
alignments of the particle velocity and the local fluid temperature gradient.
The temperature structure functions, which characterize the temperature
fluctuations across the scales of the flow, clearly show that the fluctuations
of the fluid temperature increments are monotonically suppressed in the two-way
coupled regime as the particle thermal response time is increased. Thermal
caustics dominate the particle temperature increments at small scales, that is,
particles that come into contact are likely to have very large differences in

1D systems are by nature fragile to a small amount of disorder that induces
low-energy excitations, hence obtaining Majorana zero modes well isolated in a
hard gap requires extremely clean systems. Two-dimensional systems offer an
alternative route to get robust Majorana zero modes. Indeed, it was shown
recently that Pb/Co/Si(111) could be used as a platform for generating 2D
topological superconductivity with a strong immunity to local disorder. While
2D systems exhibit dispersive chiral edge states, they can also host Majorana
zero modes located on local topological defects. According to predictions, if
an odd number of zero modes are located in a topological domain an additional
zero mode should appear all around the domain's edge. Here we use scanning
tunneling spectroscopy to characterize a disordered superconducting monolayer
of Pb coupled to underlying Co-Si magnetic islands meant to induce a
topological transition. We show that pairs of zero modes are stabilized: one
zero mode positioned at a point in the middle of the magnetic domain and its
zero mode partner extended all around the domain. The zero mode pair is
remarkably robust, it is isolated within a hard superconducting energy gap and
it appears totally immune to the strong disorder present in the Pb monolayer.
Our theoretical scenario supports the protected Majorana nature of this zero
mode pair, highlighting the role of magnetic or spin-orbit coupling textures.
This robust pair of Majorana zero modes offers a new platform for theoretical

technologies: the Josephson junction and the superconducting nanowire. While
the Josephson junction (JJ) remains the dominant technology due to its high
speed and low power dissipation, recently proposed nanowire devices offer
improvements such as gain, high fanout, and compatibility with CMOS circuits.
Despite these benefits, nanowire-based electronics have largely been limited to
binary operations, with devices switching between the superconducting state and
a high-impedance resistive state dominated by uncontrolled hotspot dynamics.
Unlike the JJ, they cannot increment an output through successive switching,
and their operation speeds are limited by their slow thermal reset times. Thus,
there is a need for an intermediate device with the interfacing capabilities of
a nanowire but a faster, moderated response allowing for modulation of the
output. Here, we present a nanowire device based on controlled fluxon
transport. We show that the device is capable of responding proportionally to
the strength of its input, unlike other nanowire technologies. The device can
be operated to produce a multilevel output with distinguishable states, which
can be tuned by circuit parameters. Agreement between experimental results and
electrothermal circuit simulations demonstrates that the device is classical

This framework is a thermodynamic foundation of the integrated information

minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We analytically illustrate this

arching and bridging of spherical particles in a 3D suspension flow through a
channel with plane walls. Elasticity of the particles and the channel walls are
taken into account. The carrier fluid is viscous and incompressible. Bridging
occurs under the balance of the hydrodynamic force exerted from the fluid on
the particles and the friction force exerted from the walls on the particles.
The 3D motion of particles in fluid is analyzed by means of direct numerical
simulation. The bridging criterion is formulated as a domain on the plane in
terms of the two nondimensional parameters: the particle size to channel width
ratio and the flow velocity. For each scaled particle diameter there is a range
of critical velocities, in which bridging occurs. Various geometrical
configurations are considered: three and four particles across the slot.
Stability of the bridge is studied. The dynamic bridging criterion is different
from the earlier purely kinematic criteria, which were formulated in terms of
the particle-to-channel width ratio only. The bridging criterion is implemented
into the 2D width-averaged lubrication model of suspension flow through a plane
channel, and illustrative simulations are conducted. Application is for
proppant transport in hydraulic fractures.

improve performance in dynamic programming language implementations. These code
caches, along with the associated profiling data for the hot code, however,
consume significant amounts of memory. Furthermore, they incur extra JIT
compilation time for their creation. On Android, the current standard JIT
compiler and its code caches are not shared among processes---that is, the
runtime system maintains a private code cache, and its associated data, for
each runtime process. However, applications running on the same platform tend
to share multiple libraries in common. Sharing cached code across multiple
applications and multiple processes can lead to a reduction in memory use. It
can directly reduce compile time. It can also reduce the cumulative amount of
time spent interpreting code. All three of these effects can improve actual
runtime performance.
  In this paper, we describe ShareJIT, a global code cache for JITs that can
share code across multiple applications and multiple processes. We implemented
ShareJIT in the context of the Android Runtime (ART), a widely used,
state-of-the-art system. To increase sharing, our implementation constrains the
amount of context that the JIT compiler can use to optimize the code. This
exposes a fundamental tradeoff: increased specialization to a single process'
context decreases the extent to which the compiled code can be shared. In
ShareJIT, we limit some optimization to increase shareability. To evaluate the
ShareJIT, we tested 8 popular Android apps in a total of 30 experiments.
ShareJIT improved overall performance by 9% on average, while decreasing memory
consumption by 16% on average and JIT compilation time by 37% on average.

dimerization of the wall, explaining the presence of the in-gap states and the

involve deciding which image to show, which wording to use, what color

an exponentially large decision space. Randomized experiments do not scale well
to this setting, and therefore, in practice, one is typically limited to

explore the layout space efficiently and use hill-climbing to select optimal

our approach to large decision spaces with strong interactions between content.

black hole no scalar hair theorems of GR, allowing both the standard GR
solutions and new scalarised ($a.k.a.$ hairy) solutions, which in some cases
are thermodynamically preferred. Up to now, however, only (static and
spherically symmetric) scalarised Schwarzschild solutions have been considered.
It would be desirable to take into account the effect of rotation; however, the
higher curvature invariants introduce a considerable challenge in obtaining the
corresponding scalarised rotating black holes. As a toy model for rotation, we
present here the scalarised generalisation of the Schwarzschild-NUT solution,
taking either the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) or the Chern-Simons (CS) curvature
invariant. The NUT charge $n$ endows spacetime with ""rotation"", but the angular
dependence of the corresponding scalarised solutions factorises, leading to a
considerable technical simplification. For GB, but not for CS, scalarisation
occurs for $n=0$. This basic difference leads to a distinct space of solutions
in the CS case, in particular exhibiting a double branch structure. In the GB
case, increasing the horizon area demands a stronger non-minimal coupling for
scalarisation; in the CS case, due to the double branch structure, both this
and the opposite trend are found. We briefly comment also on the scalarised
Reissner-Nordstr\""om-NUT solutions.

combines a fast method for describing the visible boundary of each body with a

any number of spherical bodies, with a computational accuracy that is
adjustable through the use of a tolerance parameter. Most significantly, the

employ a multitude of limb darkening laws, including all of the commonly used

rotation with an arbitrary orientation of the rotation axis, using any of these

program based on intensity mapping of the redshifted 21cm emission line from
neutral hydrogen at radio frequencies. The proposed intensity mapping survey
has the unique capability to quadruple the volume of the Universe surveyed by
optical programs, provide a percent-level measurement of the expansion history
to $z \sim 6$, open a window to explore physics beyond the concordance
$\Lambda$CDM model, and to significantly improve the precision on standard
cosmological parameters. In addition, characterization of dark energy and new
physics will be powerfully enhanced by cross-correlations with optical surveys
and cosmic microwave background measurements. The rich dataset obtained by the
proposed intensity mapping instrument will be simultaneously useful in
exploring the time-domain physics of fast radio transients and pulsars,
potentially in live ""multi-messenger"" coincidence with other observatories. The
core dark energy/inflation science advances enabled by this program are the
following: (i) Measure the expansion history of the universe over $z=0.3-6$
with a single instrument, extending the range deep into the pre-acceleration
era, providing an unexplored window for new physics; (ii) Measure the growth
rate of structure in the universe over the same redshift range; (iii) Observe,
or constrain, the presence of inflationary relics in the primordial power
spectrum, improving existing constraints by an order of magnitude; (iv)
Observe, or constrain, primordial non-Gaussianity with unprecedented precision,
improving constraints on several key numbers by an order of magnitude. Detailed
mapping of the enormous, and still largely unexplored, volume of cosmic space
will thus provide unprecedented information on fundamental questions of the
vacuum energy and early-universe physics.

coronary heart disease, replacing traditional metal stents. Often,
intravascular optical coherence tomography is used to assess potential
malapposition after implantation and for follow-up examinations later on.
Typically, the scaffold is manually reviewed by an expert, analyzing each of
the hundreds of image slices. As this is time consuming, automatic stent
detection and visualization approaches have been proposed, mostly for metal
stent detection based on classic image processing. As bioresorbable scaffolds
are harder to detect, recent approaches have used feature extraction and
machine learning methods for automatic detection. However, these methods
require detailed, pixel-level labels in each image slice and extensive feature
engineering for the particular stent type which might limit the approaches'
generalization capabilities. Therefore, we propose a deep learning-based method
for bioresorbable scaffold visualization using only image-level labels. A
convolutional neural network is trained to predict whether an image slice
contains a metal stent, a bioresorbable scaffold, or no device. Then, we derive
local stent strut information by employing weakly supervised localization using
saliency maps with guided backpropagation. As saliency maps are generally
diffuse and noisy, we propose a novel patch-based method with image shifting
which allows for high resolution stent visualization. Our convolutional neural
network model achieves a classification accuracy of 99.0 % for image-level
stent classification which can be used for both high quality in-slice stent
visualization and 3D rendering of the stent structure.

modality's field of view is a common problem during interventions. Optical
coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging modality which is used in
interventions due to its high spatial resolution of few micrometers and its
temporal resolution of potentially several hundred volumes per second. However,
performing motion compensation with OCT is problematic due to its small field
of view which might lead to tracked objects being lost quickly. We propose a
novel deep learning-based approach that directly learns input parameters of
motors that move the scan area for motion compensation from optical coherence
tomography volumes. We design a two-path 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)
architecture that takes two volumes with an object to be tracked as its input
and predicts the necessary motor input parameters to compensate the object's
movement. In this way, we learn the calibration between object movement and
system parameters for motion compensation with arbitrary objects. Thus, we
avoid error-prone hand-eye calibration and handcrafted feature tracking from
classical approaches. We achieve an average correlation coefficient of 0.998
between predicted and ground-truth motor parameters which leads to sub-voxel
accuracy. Furthermore, we show that our deep learning model is real-time

reported recently in several publications. A boron-rich material is evaporated
by a laser or plasma in a nitrogen-rich atmosphere to supply precursor gaseous
species for nucleation and growth of BNNTs. Either hydrogen was added or
pressure was increased in the system to achieve high yield and high purity of
the synthesized nanotubes. According to the widely-accepted ""root grow""
mechanism, upon the gas cooling, boron droplets form first, then they adsorb
nitrogen from surrounding gas species, and BNNTs grow on their surfaces.
However, what are these precursor species that provide nitrogen for the growth
is still an open question. To answer this question, we performed thermodynamic
calculations of B-N mixture composition considering broad set of gas species.
In enhancement of previous studies, the condensation of boron is now taken into
account and is shown to have drastic effect on the gas chemical composition.
B2N molecules were identified to be a major source of nitrogen for growth of
BNNTs. Presence of B2N molecules in a B-N gas mixture was verified by our
spectroscopic measurements during a laser ablation of boron-rich targets in
nitrogen. It was shown that the increase of pressure has a quantitative effect
on the mixture composition yielding increase of the precursor density. The
hydrogen addition might open an additional channel of nitrogen supply to
support growth of BNNTs. Nitrogen atoms react with abundant H2 molecules to
form NH2 and then NH3 precursor species, instead of just recombining back to
inert N2 molecules, as in the no-hydrogen case. In addition, thermodynamics was
applied in conjunction with agglomeration theory to predict the size of boron
droplets upon growth of BNNTs. Analytical relations for identification of
crucial species densities were derived.

model, in the singularly perturbed limit of a long-range inhibition and
short-range activation for the membrane-bound species, asymptotic methods are
used to analyze the existence of localized steady-state multi-spike
membrane-bound patterns, and to derive a nonlocal eigenvalue problem (NLEP)
characterizing $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time-scale instabilities of these patterns. A
central, and novel, feature of this NLEP is that it involves a membrane Green's
function that is coupled nonlocally to a bulk Green's function. When the domain
is a disk, or in the well-mixed shadow-system limit corresponding to an
infinite bulk diffusivity, this Green's function problem is analytically
tractable, and as a result we will use a hybrid analytical-numerical approach
to determine unstable spectra of this NLEP. This analysis characterizes how the
2-D bulk diffusion process and the bulk-membrane coupling modifies the
well-known linear stability properties of steady-state spike patterns for the
1-D Gierer-Meinhardt model in the absence of coupling. In particular, phase
diagrams in parameter space for our coupled model characterizing either
oscillatory instabilities due to Hopf bifurcations, or competition
instabilities due to zero-eigenvalue crossings are constructed. Finally, linear

propose Multilevel Medical Embedding (MiME) which learns the multilevel
embedding of EHR data while jointly performing auxiliary prediction tasks that
rely on this inherent EHR structure without the need for external labels. We
conducted two prediction tasks, heart failure prediction and sequential disease
prediction, where MiME outperformed baseline methods in diverse evaluation
settings. In particular, MiME consistently outperformed all baselines when
predicting heart failure on datasets of different volumes, especially
demonstrating the greatest performance improvement (15% relative gain in PR-AUC
over the best baseline) on the smallest dataset, demonstrating its ability to
effectively model the multilevel structure of EHR data.

the notion of \emph{zero-speed and breather solutions}, i.e., solutions that do
not decay to zero as $t\to +\infty$ on compact intervals of space. We prove
that, under suitable decay assumptions, such solutions do not exist because the
identically zero solution is the global attractor of the dynamics, at least in
a spatial interval of size $|x|\lesssim t^{1/2-}$ as $t\to+\infty$. As a
consequence, we also show scattering and decay in CH type equations with long

promises to bring about new means to control material properties, new concepts

theories of QED phenomena in complex electronic and photonic systems. In this
Letter, we develop a variational theory of general non-relativistic QED systems
of coupled light and matter. Essential to our ansatz is the notion of an
effective photonic vacuum whose modes are different than the modes in the
absence of light-matter coupling. This variational formulation leads to a set
of general equations that can describe the ground state of multi-electron
systems coupled to many photonic modes in real space. As a first step towards a
new ab initio approach to ground and excited state energies in QED, we apply
our ansatz to describe a multi-level emitter coupled to many optical modes, a
system with no analytical solution. We find a compact semi-analytical formula
which describes ground and excited state energies to less than 1% error in all
regimes of coupling parameters allowed by sum rules. Additionally, our
formulation provides essentially a non-perturbative theory of Lamb shifts and
Casimir-Polder forces, as well as suggesting new physical concepts such as the
Casimir energy of a single atom in a cavity. Our method should give rise to
highly accurate descriptions of phenomena in general QED systems, such as

Given a specific
configuration of one such changing network, it becomes a particularly
interesting issue to quantify the diversity of possible unfoldings of its
topology. In this work, we suggest the concept of malleability of a network,
which is defined as the exponential of the entropy of the probabilities of each
possible unfolding with respect to a given configuration. We calculate the
malleability with respect to specific measurements of the involved topologies.
More specifically, we identify the possible topologies derivable from a given
configuration and calculate some topological measurement of them (e.g.
clustering coefficient, shortest path length, assortativity, etc.), leading to
respective probabilities being associated to each possible measurement value.
Though this approach implies some level of degeneracy in the mapping from
topology to measurement space, it still paves the way to inferring the
malleability of specific network types with respect to given topological
measurements. We report that the malleability, in general, depends on each
specific measurement, with the average shortest path length and degree
assortativity typically leading to large malleability values. The maximum
malleability was observed for the Wikipedia network and the minimum for the
Watts-Strogatz model.

\Gamma_{b}^{0.77\pm0.11}$. We further test the Hills-Heggie law against the
{\it binary hardness ratio}, defined as the relative number of X-ray-emitting
hard binaries to MS binaries and approximated by $L_{X}/(L_{K}f_{b})$, with
$L_{K}$ being the GC K-band luminosity and $f_b$ the MS binary fraction. We
demonstrate that the binary hardness ratio of most GCs is larger than that of
the Solar neighborbood stars, and exhibits a positive correlation with the
cluster specific encounter rate ($\gamma$), as $L_{X}/(L_{K}f_{b}) \propto
\gamma^{0.65\pm0.12}$. We also find a strong correlation between the binary
hardness ratio and cluster velocity dispersion ($\sigma$), with
$L_{X}/(L_{K}f_{b}) \propto \sigma^{1.71\pm0.48}$, which is consistent with the
Hills-Heggie law. We discuss the role of binary encounters in the context of
the Nuclear Star Cluster, arguing that the X-ray-emitting, close binaries
detected therein could have been predominatly formed in GCs that later
inspiralled to the Galactic center.

Refinement has been studied thoroughly for the data, functional and concurrency

aims at providing a formal construct for the verification of refinement in time
models, through the definition of an order between strict partial orders used
to relate the different instants in asynchronous systems. This relation allows
the designer at the concrete level to distinguish events that are coincident at

Physics in order to understand more realistic systems, from classical to

integrable in Newtonian mechanics, whether forced, damped or multidimensional.
On the other hand, it is known that relativistic, one-dimensional driven
oscillators present chaotic behavior. However, there is no analogous result in
the literature concerning relativistic conservative, two-dimensional
oscillators. We consider in this paper different separable potentials for
two-dimensional oscillators in the context of special relativistic dynamics. We
show, by means of different chaos indicators, that all these systems present
chaotic behavior under specific initial conditions. In particular, the
relativistic anisotropic, two-dimensional harmonic oscillator is chaotic. The
non-integrability of the system is shown to come from the momentum coupling in
the kinetic part of the Hamiltonian, even if there are no coupling terms in the
potential. It follows that chaos must appear in most integrable classical
systems once we introduce relativistic corrections to the dynamics. The chaotic
nature of the relativistic, anisotropic harmonic oscillator may be detected in
the laboratory using Bose condensates in a two-dimensional optical lattice,
extending the recent experiments on the one-dimensional case.

withstand, before yielding to the surrounding blood flow. Namely,
Lattice-Boltzmann Method flow simulations are performed based on 3D clot
geometries. The latter are estimated from intravital microscopy images of
laser-induced injuries in cremaster microvasculature of live mice. In addition
to reporting the blood clot yield stresses, we also show that the thrombus
'core' does not experience significant deformation, while its 'shell' does.
This indicates that the latter is more prone to embolization. Hence, drugs
should be designed to target the shell selectively, while leaving the core
intact (to minimize excessive bleeding). Finally, we laid down a foundation for
a nondimensionalization procedure, which unraveled a relationship between clot
mechanics and biology. Hence, the proposed framework could ultimately lead to a
unified theory of thrombogenesis, capable of explaining all clotting events.

determining the critical physical and chemical pictures, in which the accurate
multi-orbital hybridizations are very useful in comprehending the diverse
phenomena, e.g., the C- and Si-co-dominated energy bands, the semiconducting or
metallic behaviors, and the existence/absence of Dirac-cone band structures.
This developing model could be generalized to other emergent layered materials.

whose vorticity is a finite Radon measure and velocity has locally finite
kinetic energy, which is called the vortex sheet solution. The filtered Euler
equations are a regularized model based on a spatial filtering to the Euler
equations. The 2D filtered Euler equations have a unique global weak solution
for measure valued initial vorticity, while the 2D Euler equations require
initial vorticity to be in the vortex sheet class with a distinguished sign for
the existence of global solutions. In this paper, we prove that vortex sheet
solutions of the 2D filtered Euler equations converge to those of the 2D Euler
equations in the limit of the filtering parameter provided that initial vortex
sheet has a distinguished sign. We also show that a simple application of our
proof yields the convergence of the vortex blob method for vortex sheet
solutions. Moreover, we make it clear what kind of condition should be imposed
on the spatial filter to show the convergence results and, according to the
condition, these results are applicable to well-known regularized models like
the Euler-$\alpha$ model and the vortex blob model.

based on the non-gray phonon transport model is developed for multiscale heat
transfer problem with arbitrary temperature difference. Under large temperature
difference, the phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) is essentially
multiscale, not only in the frequency space, but also in the spatial space. In
order to realize the efficient coupling of the multiscale phonon transport, the
phonon scattering and advection are coupled together in the present scheme on
the reconstruction of the distribution function at the cell interface. The
Newtonian method is adopted to solve the nonlinear scattering term for the
update of the temperature at both the cell center and interface. In addition,
the energy at the cell center is updated by a macroscopic equation instead of
taking the moment of the distribution function, which enhances the numerical
conservation. Numerical results of the cross-plane heat transfer prove that the
present scheme can describe the multiscale heat transfer phenomena accurately
with arbitrary temperature difference in a wide range. In the diffusive regime,
even if the time step is larger than the relaxation time, the present scheme
can capture the transient thermal transport process accurately. Compared to
that under small temperature differences, as the temperature difference
increases, the variation of the temperature distribution behaves quite
differently and the average temperature in the domain increases in the
ballistic regime but decreases in the diffusive regime.

the internal magnetic field across the orbital ordering temperature Torb while
stripe-type antiferromagnetism is absent. Giant antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin
fluctuations measured by the NMR spin-lattice relaxation are gradually
developed starting at ~ 40 K, which is far below the nematic ordering

of the nematic order, and the AFM spin fluctuation is the driving mechanism of
superconductivity in FeSe under the presence of the nematic order.

  Applied Mathematics",,,,"math.MG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Applications in data science, shape analysis and object classification
frequently require comparison of probability distributions defined on different
ambient spaces. To accomplish this, one requires a notion of distance on a
given class of metric measure spaces -- that is, compact metric spaces endowed
with probability measures. Such distances are typically defined as comparisons
between metric measure space invariants, such as distance distributions (also
referred to as shape distributions, distance histograms or shape contexts in
the literature). Generally, distances defined in terms of distance
distributions are actually pseudometrics, in that they may vanish when
comparing nonisomorphic spaces. The goal of this paper is to set up a formal
framework for assessing the discrimininative power of distance distributions,
i.e., the extend to which these pseudometrics fail to define proper metrics. We
formulate several precise inverse problems in terms of these invariants and
answer them in several categories of metric measure spaces, including the
category of plane curves, where we give a counterexample to the Curve Histogram
Conjecture of Brinkman and Olver, the categories of embedded and Riemannian
manifolds, where we obtain sphere rigidity results, and the category of metric
graphs, where we obtain a local injectivity result along the lines of classical
work of Boutin and Kemper on point cloud configurations. The inverse problems
are further contextualized by the introduction of a variant of the
Gromov-Wasserstein distance on the space of metric measure spaces, which is
inspired by the original Monge formulation of optimal transport.

examples have caused concerns with regards to its trustworthiness: A small
perturbation of an input results in an arbitrary failure of an otherwise

the intrinsic properties of adversarial examples, such as their transferability
and universality, there is insufficient theoretic analysis to help understand
the phenomenon in a way that can influence the design process of ML
experiments. In this paper, we deduce an information-theoretic model which
explains adversarial attacks as the abuse of feature redundancies in ML
algorithms. We prove that feature redundancy is a necessary condition for the
existence of adversarial examples. Our model helps to explain some major
questions raised in many anecdotal studies on adversarial examples. Our theory
is backed up by empirical measurements of the information content of benign and
adversarial examples on both image and text datasets. Our measurements show
that typical adversarial examples introduce just enough redundancy to overflow
the decision making of an ML model trained on corresponding benign examples. We
conclude with actionable recommendations to improve the robustness of machine
learners against adversarial examples.

qualitative change in the field dependence of the Hall effect indicative of an
increase in the high-field limit and a change in the Fermiology, and a sharp
increase in the density of states as a function of energy. Following
consideration of three possible origins for the observed phenomenology we
conclude that the most likely source is non-ellipsoidicity of the $L$-pocket

directly by our quantum oscillation measurements. Comparison to density

more reliable and insensitive to pose and illumination variations. Recently,
low-cost and portable 3D acquisition techniques like ToF(Time of Flight) and
DoE based structured light systems enable us to access 3D data easily, e.g.,
via a mobile phone. However, such devices only provide sparse(limited speckles
in structured light system) and noisy 3D data which can not support face
recognition directly. In this paper, we aim at achieving high-performance face
recognition for devices equipped with such modules which is very meaningful in
practice as such devices will be very popular. We propose a framework to
perform face recognition by fusing a sequence of low-quality 3D data. As 3D
data are sparse and noisy which can not be well handled by conventional methods
like the ICP algorithm, we design a PointNet-like Deep Registration
Network(DRNet) which works with ordered 3D point coordinates while preserving
the ability of mining local structures via convolution. Meanwhile we develop a
novel loss function to optimize our DRNet based on the quaternion expression
which obviously outperforms other widely used functions. For face recognition,
we design a deep convolutional network which takes the fused 3D depth-map as
input based on AMSoftmax model. Experiments show that our DRNet can achieve
rotation error 0.95{\deg} and translation error 0.28mm for registration. The
face recognition on fused data also achieves rank-1 accuracy 99.2% , FAR-0.001
97.5% on Bosphorus dataset which is comparable with state-of-the-art
high-quality data based recognition performance.

and by fixing $q$ or $T$. We show that the universal part is finite across the
superconductor phase transition and has competitive behaviors different from
the finite part of entanglement entropy. The behavior of the subregion
complexity depends on the gravitational coupling constant divided by the gauge
coupling constant. When this ratio is less than the critical value, the
subregion complexity increases as temperature becomes low. This behavior is
similar to the one of the holographic $1+1$ dimensional $s$-wave superconductor

subregion complexity has a non-monotonic behavior as a function of $q$ or $T$.
We also find a discontinuous jump of the subregion complexity as a function of
the size of the interval. The subregion complexity has the maximum when it
wraps the almost entire spatial circle. Due to competitive behaviors between
normal and condensed phases, the universal term in the condensed phase becomes
even smaller than that of the normal phase by probing the black hole horizon at
a large interval. It implies that the formed condensate decreases the subregion
complexity like the case of the entanglement entropy.

mapping has focused on solving the data association problem, the grid cell
neurons underlying maps in the mammalian brain appear to intentionally break
data association by encoding many locations with a single grid cell neuron. One
potential benefit of this intentional aliasing is both sub-linear map storage
and computational requirements growth with environment size, which we
demonstrated in a previous proof-of-concept study that detected and encoded
mutually complementary co-prime pattern frequencies in the visual map data. In
this research, we solve several of the key theoretical and practical
limitations of that prototype model and achieve significantly better sub-linear
storage growth, a factor reduction in storage requirements per map location,
scalability to large datasets on standard compute equipment and improved
robustness to environments with visually challenging appearance change. These
improvements are achieved through several innovations including a flexible
user-driven choice mechanism for the periodic patterns underlying the new
encoding method, a parallelized chunking technique that splits the map into
sub-sections processed in parallel and a novel feature selection approach that
selects only the image information most relevant to the encoded temporal
patterns. We evaluate our techniques on two large benchmark datasets with the
comparison to the previous state-of-the-art system, as well as providing a
detailed analysis of system performance with respect to parameters such as
required precision performance and the number of cyclic patterns encoded.

the inverse of it. With HWI, the capacity as well as the utility of

effective noise density and the decrement of utility in closed-forms. With
those the impacts of increasing the surface-area can be clearly seen. One
interesting but also natural outcome is that both the capacity and utility can
be decreased when increasing the surface-area in the cases with severe HWI. The
turning points where the capacity and the utility start to decrease with HWI
can be evaluated from the derived formulas for them. Further, we also consider

observed by DAMA/LIBRA only when the WIMP velocity distribution departs from a

$\delta$ fall in the approximate ranges 7 GeV $\lesssim m_{\chi}\lesssim$ 17

current state-of-the-art solutions in this field work by creating an embedding
model that maps binary functions into vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Such
embedding model captures syntactic and semantic similarity between binaries,
i.e., similar binary functions are mapped to points that are close in the

to precompute embeddings of several binary functions, and then compare them
with simple geometric operations (e.g., dot product). In [32] functions are
first transformed in Annotated Control Flow Graphs (ACFGs) constituted by
manually engineered features and then graphs are embedded into vectors using a
deep neural network architecture. In this paper we propose and test several
ways to compute annotated control flow graphs that use unsupervised approaches
for feature learning, without incurring a human bias. Our methods are inspired
after techniques used in the natural language processing community (e.g., we
use word2vec to encode assembly instructions). We show that our approach is

fundamental problem in network theory. Its origin can be traced back to social
sciences and led to ranking algorithms based on graph theoretic centralities.
Coupled dynamical systems differ from social networks in that, they are
characterized by degrees of freedom with a deterministic dynamics and the
coupling between individual units is a well-defined function of those degrees
of freedom. One therefore expects the resulting coupled dynamics, and not only
the network topology, to also determine the key players. Here, we investigate
synchronizable network-coupled dynamical systems such as high voltage electric
power grids and coupled oscillators. We search for nodes which, once perturbed
by a local noisy disturbance, generate the largest overall transient excursion
away from synchrony. A spectral decomposition of the coupling matrix leads to
an elegant, concise, yet accurate solution to this identification problem. We
show that, when the internodal coupling matrix is Laplacian, these key players
are peripheral in the sense of a centrality measure defined from effective
resistance distances. For linearly coupled dynamical systems such as weakly
loaded power grids or consensus algorithms, the nodal ranking is efficiently
obtained through a single Laplacian matrix inversion, regardless of the
operational synchronous state. We call the resulting ranking index LRank. For
heavily loaded power grids or coupled oscillators systems closer to the
transition to synchrony, nonlinearities render the nodal ranking dependent on
the synchronous state. In this case a weighted Laplacian matrix inversion gives
another ranking index, which we call WLRank. Quite surprisingly, we find that
LRank provides a faithful ranking even for well developed coupling
nonlinearities, corresponding to oscillator angle differences up to $40^o$
approximately.

system for Frisian-Dutch code-switching (CS) speech extracted from the archives
of a local broadcaster with the ultimate goal of building a spoken document
retrieval system. Unlike Dutch, Frisian is a low-resourced language with a very
limited amount of manually annotated speech data. In this paper, we describe
several automatic annotation approaches to enable using of a large amount of
raw bilingual broadcast data for acoustic model training in a semi-supervised
setting. Previously, it has been shown that the best-performing ASR system is
obtained by two-stage multilingual deep neural network (DNN) training using 11
hours of manually annotated CS speech (reference) data together with speech
data from other high-resourced languages. We compare the quality of
transcriptions provided by this bilingual ASR system with several other
approaches that use a language recognition system for assigning language labels
to raw speech segments at the front-end and using monolingual ASR resources for
transcription. We further investigate automatic annotation of the speakers
appearing in the raw broadcast data by first labeling with (pseudo) speaker
tags using a speaker diarization system and then linking to the known speakers
appearing in the reference data using a speaker recognition system. These
speaker labels are essential for speaker-adaptive training in the proposed
setting. We train acoustic models using the manually and automatically
annotated data and run recognition experiments on the development and test data
of the FAME! speech corpus to quantify the quality of the automatic
annotations. The ASR and CS detection results demonstrate the potential of
using automatic language and speaker tagging in semi-supervised bilingual
acoustic model training.

high relative spectro-photometric accuracy between wavelengths during
transit/eclipse observation. The spectro-photometric signal is not affected
only by image movement and deformation due to wavefront error but also by
electrical variation in the detector system. These time-variation components,
coupled to the transit signal, distort the measurements of atmospheric
composition in transit spectroscopy. Here we propose a new concept for
improvement of spectro-photometric accuracy through the calibration of the
time-variation components in the detector system by developing densified pupil
spectroscopy that provides multiple spectra of the star-planet system. Owing to
a group of pixels exposed by the object light (i.e., science pixels),
pixel-to-pixel variations can be smoothed out through an averaging operation,
thus only common time-variation components over the science pixels remain. In
addition, considering that the detector plane is optically conjugated to the
pupil plane, a pupil mask can completely block astronomical light incoming into
residual pixels. The common time-variation components are reconstructed with
the residual pixels and reduced into a random term. Applying the densified
pupil spectrograph with a mid-infrared detector system to a large space
cryogenic telescope such as the Origins Space Telescope, we show that the
system nearly achieves photon-noise-limited performance and detects absorption
features through transmission spectroscopy and secondary eclipse of terrestrial
planets orbiting M-type stars at 10 pc with 60 transit observations. Thus, the
proposed method contributes to the measurement of planetary habitability and
biosignatures of the nearby transiting habitable candidates.

electronic states. Here we studied the field dependence of an incommensurate
CDW in a transition-metal chalcogenide Ta2NiSe7 with a Q1D chain structure. The
angle-dependent magnetoresistance (MR) is found to be very sensitive to the
relative orientation between the magnetic field and the chain direction. With
an applied current fixed along the b axis (the chain direction), the
angle-dependent MR shows a striking change of the symmetry below T_CDW only for
a rotating magnetic field in the ac plane. In contrast, the symmetry axis
remains unchanged for other configurations (H in ab and bc plane). The orbital

{\mu}B B / v_F can be responsible for such symmetry change, provided that the
Fermi velocity v_F is significantly anisotropic and the nesting vector changes

  Decomposition",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We address the problem of decomposing a single image into reflectance and
shading. The difficulty comes from the fact that the components of image---the
surface albedo, the direct illumination, and the ambient illumination---are
coupled heavily in observed image. We propose to infer the shading by ordering
pixels by their relative brightness, without knowing the absolute values of the
image components beforehand. The pairwise shading orders are estimated in two
ways: brightness order and low-order fittings of local shading field. The
brightness order is a non-local measure, which can be applied to any pair of
pixels including those whose reflectance and shading are both different. The
low-order fittings are used for pixel pairs within local regions of smooth
shading. Together, they can capture both global order structure and local
variations of the shading. We propose a Consistency-aware Selective Fusion
(CSF) to integrate the pairwise orders into a globally consistent order. The
iterative selection process solves the conflicts between the pairwise orders
obtained by different estimation methods. Inconsistent or unreliable pairwise
orders will be automatically excluded from the fusion to avoid polluting the
global order. Experiments on the MIT Intrinsic Image dataset show that the
proposed model is effective at recovering the shading including deep shadows.
Our model also works well on natural images from the IIW dataset, the UIUC
Shadow dataset and the NYU-Depth dataset, where the colors of direct lights and
ambient lights are quite different.

humans to perceive material appearance in single pictures. Yet, recovering
spatially-varying bi-directional reflectance distribution functions (SVBRDFs)
from a single image based on such cues has challenged researchers in computer
graphics for decades. We tackle lightweight appearance capture by training a
deep neural network to automatically extract and make sense of these visual
cues. Once trained, our network is capable of recovering per-pixel normal,
diffuse albedo, specular albedo and specular roughness from a single picture of
a flat surface lit by a hand-held flash. We achieve this goal by introducing
several innovations on training data acquisition and network design. For
training, we leverage a large dataset of artist-created, procedural SVBRDFs
which we sample and render under multiple lighting directions. We further
amplify the data by material mixing to cover a wide diversity of shading
effects, which allows our network to work across many material classes.
Motivated by the observation that distant regions of a material sample often
offer complementary visual cues, we design a network that combines an
encoder-decoder convolutional track for local feature extraction with a
fully-connected track for global feature extraction and propagation. Many
important material effects are view-dependent, and as such ambiguous when
observed in a single image. We tackle this challenge by defining the loss as a
differentiable SVBRDF similarity metric that compares the renderings of the
predicted maps against renderings of the ground truth from several lighting and
viewing directions. Combined together, these novel ingredients bring clear
improvement over state of the art methods for single-shot capture of spatially
varying BRDFs.

interactions can help to reduce the ambiguity of the decomposition
considerably. The traditional way of user interaction is to draw scribbles that
indicate regions with constant reflectance or shading. However the effect
scopes of the scribbles are quite limited, so dozens of scribbles are often
needed to rectify the whole decomposition, which is time consuming. In this
paper we propose an efficient way of user interaction that users need only to
annotate the color composition of the image. Color composition reveals the
global distribution of reflectance, so it can help to adapt the whole
decomposition directly. We build a generative model of the process that the
albedo of the material produces both the reflectance through imaging and the
color labels by color naming. Our model fuses effectively the physical
properties of image formation and the top-down information from human color
perception. Experimental results show that color naming can improve the
performance of intrinsic image decomposition, especially in cleaning the
shadows left in reflectance and solving the color constancy problem.

between natural language words and APIs. However, semantic gaps, namely textual
mismatches between words and APIs, negatively affect these tools. Previous
studies have transformed words or APIs into low-dimensional vectors for
matching; however, inaccurate results were obtained due to the failure of
modeling words and APIs simultaneously. To resolve this problem, two main
challenges are to be addressed: the acquisition of massive words and APIs for
mining and the alignment of words and APIs for modeling. Therefore, this study
proposes Word2API to effectively estimate relatedness of words and APIs.
Word2API collects millions of commonly used words and APIs from code
repositories to address the acquisition challenge. Then, a shuffling strategy
is used to transform related words and APIs into tuples to address the
alignment challenge. Using these tuples, Word2API models words and APIs
simultaneously. Word2API outperforms baselines by 10%-49.6% of relatedness
estimation in terms of precision and NDCG. Word2API is also effective on
solving typical software tasks, e.g., query expansion and API documents
linking. A simple system with Word2API-expanded queries recommends up to 21.4%
more related APIs for developers. Meanwhile, Word2API improves comparison
algorithms by 7.9%-17.4% in linking questions in Question&Answer communities to

the use of laboratories with low-vibration facilities combined with a very

reported, and in good agreement with the calculations. With this, we achieve an
average vibration level of $\sim$ 6 fm/sqrt(Hz), without a dedicated

alleviate the annotation burden by 'adapting' the networks trained on existing

High-quality images are required in order to solve (potentially life-saving)
biomedical research problems. Many microscopy techniques do not achieve
sufficient resolution for these purposes, being limited by physical diffraction
and hardware deficiencies. Electron microscopy addresses optical diffraction by
measuring emitted or transmitted electrons instead of photons, yielding
nanometer resolution. Despite pushing back the diffraction limit, blur should
still be taken into account because of practical hardware imperfections and
remaining electron diffraction. Deconvolution algorithms can remove some of the
blur in post-processing but they depend on knowledge of the point-spread
function (PSF) and should accurately regularize noise. Any errors in the
estimated PSF or noise model will reduce their effectiveness. This paper
proposes a new procedure to estimate the lateral component of the point spread
function of a 3D scanning electron microscope more accurately. We also propose
a Bayesian maximum a posteriori deconvolution algorithm with a non-local image
prior which employs this PSF estimate and previously developed noise
statistics. We demonstrate visual quality improvements and show that applying
our method improves the quality of subsequent segmentation steps.

(NOMA) network with uniformly deployed users, while a mixed multicast and
unicast traffic scenario is taken into account. By guaranteeing the quality of
service (QoS) of the multicast traffic, the multicast outage and secrecy
unicast throughput performance is evaluated. In particular, two types of
partial channel state information (CSI), namely the imperfect CSI and CSI based
on second order statistics (SOS), are investigated in the analytical framework.
For both two cases, the closed-form approximations for the multicast outage
probability and secrecy unicast throughput are derived except that the
approximation for the secrecy unicast throughput in SOS-based CSI only concerns
two users. As to the multicast outage probability, the simulation results
demonstrate that the NOMA scheme considered in both two cases achieves superior
performance compared to the traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA)
scheme, while for the secrecy unicast throughput, the NOMA scheme shows great
advantages over the OMA scheme in good condition (high signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR)), but is inferior to the OMA scheme in poor condition (low SNR).
Moreover, both two cases achieve similar performance except that the NOMA
scheme with imperfect CSI obtains larger secrecy unicast throughput than that
based on SOS under high SNR condition. Finally, the provided numerical results
also confirm that the derived approximations of both two cases for the
multicast outage probability and secrecy unicast throughput match well with the
Monte Carlo simulations.

error for the original random forest algorithm, one of the most frequently used
machine learning methods, are unsatisfying. We discuss and evaluate various
PAC-Bayesian approaches to derive such bounds. The bounds do not require
additional hold-out data, because the out-of-bag samples from the bagging in
the training process can be exploited. A random forest predicts by taking a
majority vote of an ensemble of decision trees. The first approach is to bound
the error of the vote by twice the error of the corresponding Gibbs classifier
(classifying with a single member of the ensemble selected at random). However,
this approach does not take into account the effect of averaging out of errors
of individual classifiers when taking the majority vote. This effect provides a
significant boost in performance when the errors are independent or negatively
correlated, but when the correlations are strong the advantage from taking the
majority vote is small. The second approach based on PAC-Bayesian C-bounds
takes dependencies between ensemble members into account, but it requires
estimating correlations between the errors of the individual classifiers. When
the correlations are high or the estimation is poor, the bounds degrade. In our
experiments, we compute generalization bounds for random forests on various
benchmark data sets. Because the individual decision trees already perform
well, their predictions are highly correlated and the C-bounds do not lead to
satisfactory results. For the same reason, the bounds based on the analysis of
Gibbs classifiers are typically superior and often reasonably tight. Bounds
based on a validation set coming at the cost of a smaller training set gave
better performance guarantees, but worse performance in most experiments.

parameters, such as stance phase, swing phase, double stance phase, cadence,
step time, stride time, stride length, velocity. Finally, to verify the
effectiveness of this system and algorithm of the paper, an experiment is
performed with 27 stoke patients from local hospital that the spatial-temporal
gait parameters obtained with the system and the algorithm are compared with a
GA tool used in medical laboratories. And the experimental results show that it
achieves very good consistency and correlation between the proposed system and
the compared GA tool.

dynamic range have remarkable applications such as in optical communications,
optical spectroscopy and spectral imaging. However, a cost is usually
associated with the filter narrowing either in the dynamic range, in the
throughput or the manufacturability. Here we report on a resonating planar
multilayered structure that exhibits transparency window in reflection with a
controllable full width at half maximum (sub-Angstroms till tens of nm) and
tunability over wide spectral range (>500nm in the visible and near infrared).
The phenomenon is observed in TE and TM polarizations with much higher contrast
in TE. Fano type resonance originating from coupling between waveguide modes
and lossy surface electromagnetic waves supported by field distribution
calculations explains the phenomenon. The wide tuning range with high contrast
is mainly achieved using an absorptive layer with high imaginary to real part
ratio of the dielectric constant that enables excitation of lossy surface waves
known to exist over a wide spectral band in thin films. To avoid large losses,
it is found that the lossy layer should be ultrathin (6nm Cr layer for
example). The tuning is achieved by small angular scan of less than 2 degrees
or by modulating the refractive index or thickness of the submicron thick
waveguide layer from the visible till the near infrared range and in principle
it can be designed to operate in any spectral range. Such a thin variable index
or thickness layer can allow tuning at ultrahigh speed using conventional
electrooptic, magnetooptic, piezoelectric or thermooptic materials at
relatively low external fields.

of vacant 8a anionic site adjacent to TiO6 octahedra. Further study with Fe
doping revealed that it essentially reduces the octahedral distortion by
introducing anionic disorder (migration of 48f oxygen ions to 8a site).

the systematic change in the ligand (O2-) coordination of the Ti4+ cations. On
the other hand, a new field induced transition (with Fe doping) at low

both with increasing applied field and Fe concentration. However, the single

distributed over different SPARQL endpoints. SPARQL-LD is a recent extension of
SPARQL 1.1 which enables to directly query any HTTP web source containing RDF
data, like web pages embedded with RDFa, JSON-LD or Microformats, without
requiring the declaration of named graphs. This makes possible to query a large
number of data sources (including SPARQL endpoints, online resources, or even
Web APIs returning RDF data) through a single one concise query. However, not
optimal formulation of SPARQL 1.1 and SPARQL-LD queries can lead to a large
number of calls to remote resources which in turn can lead to extremely high
query execution times. In this paper, we address this problem and propose a set
of query reordering methods which make use of heuristics to reorder a set of
SERVICE graph patterns based on their restrictiveness, without requiring the
gathering and use of statistics from the remote sources. Such a query
optimization approach is widely applicable since it can be exploited on top of
existing SPARQL 1.1 and SPARQL-LD implementations. Evaluation results show that
query reordering can highly decrease the query-execution time, while a method
that considers the number and type of unbound variables and joins achieves the
optimal query plan in 88% of the cases.

outcome does not affect the selection of the qualified teams are played with

to possess a spectrum of interesting magnetic phases including long range
antiferromagnetic (canted) spin ordering (TN ~269 K), Griffiths phase,
re-entrant cluster glass (RCG) (TG~ 34 K) and exchange bias. However, the NPD
study divulged the exhibition of a long range G-type (below TN ~269 K) of spin
ordering by Fe spins. Spin dynamics study by ac susceptibility technique
confirmed the system possessing long range ordering at higher

was confirmed by non-analytic field variation of magnetization and Heisenberg
type temporal spin relaxation above long range ordering temperature TN ~269 K.
The anti-site disorder related to the B-sites (Co/Fe) is found to be the main
driving force forthe observed multiple magnetic phases. Furthermore, the
electronic structure probed by the X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) study
suggested a nominal valance state of +3 for both of the B-site ions (Co/Fe)

expected to be accompanied by radius variations, and to be potentially
significant for the climate of the Earth. We aim to constrain theoretically the
radius and luminosity variations of the Sun that are due to the effect of the
variable magnetic fields in its interior associated with the dynamo cycle. We
have extended a one-dimensional stellar evolution code to include several
effects of the magnetic fields on the interior structure. We investigate
different magnetic configurations, based on both observational constraints and
on the output of state-of-the-art mean field dynamo models. We explore both
step-like and simply periodic time dependences of the magnetic field peak
strength. We find that the luminosity and radius variations are in anti-phase
and in phase, respectively, with the magnetic field strength. For peak magnetic
field strengths of the order of tens of kilogauss, luminosity variations
ranging between 10^{-6} and 10^{-3} (in modulus) and radius variations between
10^{-6} and 10^{-5} are obtained. Modest but significant radius variations (up
to 10^{-5} in relative terms) are obtained for magnetic fields of realistic
strength and geometry, providing a potentially observable signature of the
intrinsic variations. Establishing their existence in addition to the accepted
surface effects would have very important implications for the understanding of

this work, we explore ways to improve rank identification accuracies of AFIS

combined with any existing minutiae-based matcher. We first compute a
similarity score based on least squares between latent and tenprint minutiae
points, with rare minutiae features as reference points. Then the similarity
score of the reference minutiae-based matcher at hand is modified based on a
fitting error from the least square similarity stage. We use a realistic
forensic fingerprint casework database in our experiments which contains rare
minutiae features obtained from Guardia Civil, the Spanish law enforcement
agency. Experiments are conducted using three minutiae-based matchers as a

community can exchange energy and services among themselves, without going
through the usual channels of the public electricity grid. We introduce and
analyze a framework to operate a community microgrid, and to share the
resulting revenues and costs among its members. A market-oriented pricing of
energy exchanges within the community is obtained by implementing an internal
local market based on the marginal pricing scheme. The market aims at
maximizing the social welfare of the community, thanks to the more efficient
allocation of resources, the reduction of the peak power to be paid, and the
increased amount of reserve, achieved at an aggregate level. A community
microgrid operator, acting as a benevolent planner, redistributes revenues and
costs among the members, in such a way that the solution achieved by each
member within the community is not worse than the solution it would achieve by
acting individually. In this way, each member is incentivized to participate in
the community on a voluntary basis. The overall framework is formulated in the
form of a bilevel model, where the lower level problem clears the market, while
the upper level problem plays the role of the community microgrid operator.
Numerical results obtained on a real test case implemented in Belgium show
around 54% cost savings on a yearly scale for the community, as compared to the
case when its members act individually.

basis to Bell states, the spectral parameter describing the entanglement is
introduced through Yang-Baxterization. It gives rise to a new type of solutions
for Yang-Baxter equation, called the type-II that differs from the familiar
solution called type-I of YBE associated with the usual chain models. The
Majorana fermionic version of type-II yields the Kitaev Hamiltonian. The
introduced $\ell_1$ -norm leads to the maximum of the entanglement by taking
the extreme value and shows that it is related to the Wigner's D-function.
Based on the Yang-Baxter equation the 3-body S-Matrix for type-II is explicitly
given. Different from the type-I solution, the type-II solution of YBE should
be considered in describing quantum information. The idea is further extended
to $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion model based on $SU(3)$ principal representation.
The type-II is in difference from the familiar type-I in many respects. For
example, the quantities corresponding to velocity in the chain models obey the
Lorentzian additivity $\frac{u+v}{1+uv}$ rather than Galilean rule $(u+v)$.
Most possibly, for the type-II solutions of YBE there may not exist RTT
relation. Further more, for $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion model we only need the
rational Yang-Baxterization, which seems like trigonometric. Similar
discussions are also made in terms of generalized Yang-Baxter equation with

V-doped Fe16N2 are studied within the framework of density functional theory.
The Curie temperatures were obtained with both mean field approximation (MFA)
as well as Monte Carlo (MC) calculations. The Curie temperature (TC) for pure
Fe16N2 obtained within MFA are significantly larger than the experimental
value, suggesting the importance of thermal fluctuations in these systems, and
has a resemblance of a lower dimensional spin system. We also briefly discuss
about the various possible factors which may lead to a large magnetic moment in
this material. The calculated magnetic susceptibility at zero field shows sharp
peak at T=TC which resemble a local moment system. From the nature of exchange
interactions we try to figure out the nature of the Fesites which might contain
localized d-states. Finally, we point out that Fe16N2 can also act as a good
spin injector for the III-V semiconductors in addition to its well promised
application as permanent magnet since it has a very high spin polarization
(larger compared to elemental ferromagnets) as well as quite smaller lattice
mismatch (compared to half-metallic Heusler alloys) with the conventional III-V
semiconductors such as GaAs or InGaAs. We further demonstrate this through our
calculations for Fe16N2(001)/InGaAs(001) heterostructures which shows the
non-negligible spin polarization in the semiconductor (InGaAs) region implying
a long spin diffusion length.

G-band extinction map, which we use to correct our colour-magnitude diagram for

Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, and Vela. The PMS map shows a plethora of lower mass
star forming regions, such as Taurus, Perseus, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and
Lacerta, which are less visible in the UMS map, due to the lack of large
numbers of bright, early-type stars. We report the finding of a candidate new
open cluster towards $l, b \sim 218.5^{\circ}, -2^{\circ}$, which could be
related to the Orion star forming complex. We estimate ages for the PMS sample
and we study the distribution of PMS stars as a function of their age. We find
that younger stars cluster in dense, compact clumps, and are surrounded by
older sources, whose distribution is instead more diffuse. The youngest groups
that we find are mainly located in Scorpius-Centaurus, Orion, Vela, and Taurus.
Cepheus, Cassiopeia, and Lacerta are instead more evolved and less numerous.
Finally, we find that the three dimensional density maps show no evidence for
the existence of the ring-like structure which is usually referred to as the
Gould Belt.

such an issue as well as promote the quality of object attention, we introduce
a simple yet effective Self-Erasing Network (SeeNet) to prohibit attentions

and thus cannot transmit any information. In a recent Letter [D. Ebler et al.,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 120502 (2018)], it was however shown that if a quantum
state passes through two such channels in a quantum superposition of different
orders - a setup known as the ""quantum switch"" - then information can
nevertheless be transmitted through the channels. Here, we show that a similar
effect can be obtained when one coherently controls between sending a target
system through one of two identical depolarising channels. Whereas it is
tempting to attribute this effect in the quantum switch to the indefinite
causal order between the channels, causal indefiniteness plays no role in this
new scenario. This raises questions about its role in the corresponding effect
in the quantum switch. We study this new scenario in detail and we see that,
when quantum channels are controlled coherently, information about their
specific implementation is accessible in the output state of the joint
control-target system. This allows two different implementations of what is
usually considered to be the same channel to therefore be differentiated. More
generally, we find that to completely describe the action of a coherently
controlled quantum channel, one needs to specify not only a description of the
channel (e.g., in terms of Kraus operators), but an additional ""transformation
matrix"" depending on its implementation.

hardware and software costs to the specific technological skills needed. In
this work we propose an innovative high-level approach which is embodied in the
so-called LincoSim web application in which a hypothetical designer user can
carry out the simulation only starting from its own geometry and a set of
meaningful physical parameters. LincoSim automatically manages and hides to the

allowing them to access, visualize and analyze the outputs from the same single

the platform includes a back-end server which implements a Cloud logic and can
be connected to multiple HPC machines for computing. LincoSim is currently set

targets (707 stars) that exhibit a constant velocity offset of +105 km/s or -76
km/s, respectively. Overall this comparison confirms the excellent agreement
between those two data sets. The velocity differences can well be matched with
two Gaussians with FWHM of 1.2 km/s and 3.6 km/s, respectively. There is a
systematic offset of about -0.32 km/s, consistent with the findings in Gaia
DR2, who find an offset of -0.29 km/s. The offset is also comparable to the
offset found between Gaia DR2 and other ground-based spectroscopic surveys in a
similar magnitude range, indicative that the source for this offset may at
least partially be related to the radial velocity zeropoint of Gaia DR2. We
identified 707 stars that exhibit large constant velocity offsets. These cases
can be traced to a problem of the reduction pipeline in propagating the
wavelength calibration between neighboring fibres near the edges of the field
plate, in particular for observations done just before fibre repairs, i.e. when
live fibres were separated by large gaps of broken ones. In 82\%\ of these
cases the offset between RAVE DR5 and Gaia DR2 radial velocity is in the $+105

Considering that the complementarity of different media platforms, it is

boost the prediction performance. Intuitively, recognizing one venue category
involves multiple semantic cues, especially objects and scenes, and thus they
should contribute together to venue category prediction. In addition, these
venues can be organized in a natural hierarchical structure, which provides
prior knowledge to guide venue category estimation. Taking these aspects into
account, we propose a Hierarchy-dependent Cross-platform Multi-view Feature
Learning (HCM-FL) framework for venue category prediction from videos by
leveraging images from other platforms. HCM-FL includes two major components,
namely Cross-Platform Transfer Deep Learning (CPTDL) and Multi-View Feature
Learning with the Hierarchical Venue Structure (MVFL-HVS). CPTDL is capable of
reinforcing the learned deep network from videos using images from other
platforms. Specifically, CPTDL first trained a deep network using videos. These
images from other platforms are filtered by the learnt network and these
selected images are then fed into this learnt network to enhance it. Two kinds
of pre-trained networks on the ImageNet and Places dataset are employed.
MVFL-HVS is then developed to enable multi-view feature fusion. It is capable
of embedding the hierarchical structure ontology to support more discriminative
joint feature learning. We conduct the experiment on videos from Vine and

Coulomb screening by the encapsulated material and suppression of non-radiative

monolayers, we confirm that encapsulation reduces the sample inhomogeneity.
However, linewidths measured using photoluminescence and linear absorption
remain dominated by inhomogeneity, and these linewidths are roughly 5 times
larger than the homogeneous linewidth in even the highest-quality encapsulated

hydrodynamic mobility of its surface and tackle in one formulation both clean
and contaminated bubbles as well as rigid shells. Starting with a bubble of
infinitesimal size, the fluid flow and hydrodynamic forces on the growing

of the bubble slip length relative to the initial distance to the wall, the

which will exponentially thin, or it will bounce off the surface once before
eventually draining the thin film. Clean bubbles are shown to be a singular
limit who always monotonically get repelled from the surface. The bouncing
events for bubbles with finite slip lengths are further analysed in detail in
the lubrication limit. In particular, we identify the origin of the reversal of
the hydrodynamic force direction as due to the change in the flow pattern in
the film between the bubble and the surface and to the associated lubrication
pressure. Finally, the final drainage dynamics of the film is observed to
follow a universal algebraic scaling for all finite slip lengths.

hydrostatic equilibrium and stability in terms of these two and
three-dimensional energy and pressure distributions. We briefly discuss the
phenomenological relevance of our findings with a simple yet realistic model.
In the light of this exhaustive mechanical description of the nucleon, we also
present several possible connections between hadronic physics and compact
stars, like e.g. the study of the equation of state for matter under extreme
conditions and stability constraints.

by and coupled to a thin superconducting layer, where the uncovered region of
the nanowire forms a quantum dot. We find that, even if there is no topological
superconducting phase possible, there is a trivial Andreev bound state that
becomes pinned exponentially close to zero energy as a function of magnetic
field strength when the length of the quantum dot is tuned with respect to its
spin-orbit length such that a resonance condition of Fabry-Perot type is
satisfied. In this case, we find that the Andreev bound state remains pinned
near zero energy for Zeeman energies that exceed the characteristic spacing
between Andreev bound state levels but that are smaller than the spin-orbit
energy of the quantum dot. Importantly, as the pinning of the Andreev bound
state depends only on properties of the quantum dot, we conclude that this
behavior is unrelated to topological superconductivity. To support our
analytical model, we also perform a numerical simulation of a hybrid system
while explicitly incorporating a thin superconducting layer, showing that all
qualitative features of our analytical model are also present in the numerical
results.

first principles in the framework of the so-called Maxwell-Chern-Simons

Disregarding backreaction effects and endowing the system Hamiltonian with a
suitable renormalized potential interaction, the conceived description is
equivalent to a minimal-coupling theory with a gauge field giving rise to a
fluctuating force that mimics the Lorentz force induced by a particle-attached
magnetic flux. We show that the underlying symmetry structure of the theory
(i.e. time-reverse asymmetry and parity violation) yields an interacting
vortex-like Brownian dynamics for the system particles. An explicit comparison
to the conventional Brownian motion in the quantum Markovian limit reveals that
the proposed description represents a second-order correction to the well-known
damped harmonic oscillator, which manifests that there may be dissipative
phenomena intrinsic to the dimensionality of the interesting system.

an oscillatory flow with an erodible sand bed. The phenomenon of sea ripple
formation is investigated by means of direct numerical simulation in which the
sediment bed is represented by a large number of fully-resolved spherical
grains. Two sets of parameter values are adopted which are motivated by
laboratory experiments on the formation of laminar rolling-grain ripples. The
knowledge on the origin of ripples is presently enriched by insights and by
providing fluid- and sediment-related quantities that are difficult to obtain
in the laboratory. Detailed analysis of flow and sediment bed evolution has
confirmed that ripple wavelength is determined by the action of steady
recirculating cells which tend to accumulate sediment grains into ripple
crests. The ripple amplitude is observed to grow exponentially consistent with
established linear stability analysis theories. Particles at the bed surface
exhibit two kinds of motion depending on their position with respect to the
recirculating cells: particles at ripple crests are significantly faster and
show larger excursions than those lying on ripple troughs. In analogy with
segregation phenomenon of polydisperse sediments the non-uniform distribution
of the velocity field promotes the formation of ripples. The wider the gap
between the excursion of fast and slow particles, the the larger the resulting
growth rate of ripples. Finally, it is revealed that, in the absence of
turbulence, the sediment flow rate is driven by both the bed shear stress and
the wave-induced pressure gradient, the dominance of each depending on the
phase of the oscillation period. In phases of maximum bed shear stress, the
sediment flow rate correlates more with the Shields number while the pressure
gradient tends to drive sediment bed motion during phases of minimum bed shear
stress.

been considerable theoretical discussion on the possibility of fractional
quantization of conductance in the absence of Landau levels formed by a

envisaged, particularly lattice models in which band flattening resembles
Landau levels, the predicted fractions have never been observed. In this
Letter, we show that odd and even denominator fractions can be observed, and
manipulated, in the absence of a quantizing magnetic field, when a low-density
electron system in a GaAs based one-dimensional quantum wire is allowed to
relax in the second dimension. It is suggested that such a relaxation results
in formation of a zig-zag array of electrons with ring paths which establish a
cyclic current and a resultant lowering of energy. The behavior has been
observed for both symmetric and asymmetric confinement but increasing the
asymmetry of the confinement potential, to result in a flattening of
confinement, enhances the appearance of new fractional states. We find that an
in-plane magnetic field induces new even denominator fractions possibly
indicative of electron pairing. The new quantum states described here have
implications both for the physics of low dimensional electron systems and also
for quantum technologies. This work will enable further development of
structures which are designed to electrostatically manipulate the electrons for
the formation of particular configurations. In turn, this could result in a
designer tailoring of fractional states to amplify particular properties of
importance in future quantum computation.

projections of the phase portraits of the corresponding dynamic system are
built. Just as in the case of single scalar fields, the phase space of such

energy unavailable for motion, getting appear there. The distinctive feature of
the asymmetrical scalar doublet is the time dependency of the prohibited
ranges' projections on the phase subspaces of each field as a result of which
the existence of the limit cycles with null effective energy depends on the
parameters of the field model and initial conditions. The numerical models

a cascading current sheet formation process that terminates for current sheets
with width of ~2m and length of $\sim100$~m, corresponding to the critical
current sheet aspect ratio of $\sim50$. We also observe that the plasmoid
instability is the primary physical mechanism accelerating the magnetic
reconnection in this plasma parameter regime. After plasmoid instabilities
appear, the reconnection rate sharply increases to a value of $\sim$ 0.035,
observed to be independent of the Lundquist number. These characteristics are
very similar to magnetic reconnection in fully ionized plasmas. In this low

large-scale density fluctuations in systems ranging across the natural and
mathematical sciences. One can rank a large class of hyperuniform systems by
their ability to suppress long-range density fluctuations through the use of a
hyperuniformity order metric $\bar{\Lambda}$. We apply this order metric to the
Barlow packings, which are the infinitely degenerate densest packings of
identical rigid spheres that are distinguished by their stacking geometries and
include the commonly known fcc lattice and hcp crystal. The ""stealthy stacking""
theorem implies that these packings are all stealthy hyperuniform, a strong
type of hyperuniformity which involves the suppression of scattering up to a
wavevector $K$. We describe the geometry of three classes of Barlow packings,
two disordered classes and small-period packings. In addition, we compute a
lower bound on $K$ for all Barlow packings. We compute $\bar{\Lambda}$ for the
aforementioned three classes of Barlow packings and find that to a very good
approximation, it is linear in the fraction of fcc-like clusters, taking values
between those of least-ordered hcp and most-ordered fcc. This implies that the
$\bar{\Lambda}$ of all Barlow packings is primarily controlled by the local
cluster geometry. These results indicate the special nature of anisotropic
stacking disorder, which provides impetus for future research on the
development of anisotropic order metrics and hyperuniformity properties.

increases.
  We show here that, under the assumption that the diffusion matrix is
piecewise constant, the corrector problem to solve can be recast as an integral
equation. In case of spherical inclusions with isotropic materials, we explain
how to efficiently discretize this integral equation using spherical harmonics,
and how to use the fast multipole method (FMM) to compute the resulting

symmetry, the fermion charge operator is invariant under a larger symmetry
group, SU(2N_F), that includes chiral transformations as well as SU(2)_{CS}
chiralspin transformations that mix the right- and left-handed components of

while confining chromo-electric interaction contributes to all modes. At high

validating the computational scheme. Moreover, we examine the effects of
vibrational mismatch between the solids' phonon spectra on the heat transfer

vibrational anharmonicity: It raises the resistance of the junction due to
multiple scattering processes, yet it promotes energy transport across a

generally in the form of structures of low surface brightness, such as stellar
streams. While their low surface brightness makes it challenging to determine
their age, metallicity, kinematics and spatial structure, the infalling
galaxies also deposit globular clusters (GCs) in the halo, which are bright and
therefore easier to observe and characterise. To understand how GCs associated
with stellar streams can be used to estimate the stellar mass and the infall
time of their parent galaxy, we examine a subset of 15 simulations of galaxies
and their star clusters from the E-MOSAICS project. E-MOSAICS is a suite of
hydrodynamical simulations incorporating a sub-grid model for GC formation and
evolution. We find that more massive accreted galaxies typically contribute
younger and more metal rich GCs. This lower age results from a more extended
cluster formation history in more massive galaxies. In addition, at fixed
stellar mass, galaxies that are accreted later host younger clusters, because
they can continue to form GCs without being subjected to environmental
influences for longer. This explains the large range of ages observed for
clusters associated with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy in the halo of the Milky
Way compared to clusters which are thought to have formed in satellites
accreted early in the Milky Way's formation history. Using the ages of the GCs
associated with the Sagittarius dwarf, we estimate a virial radius crossing
lookback time (infall time) of $9.3 \pm 1.8 Gyr$.

We extract 2182 cluster candidates, including 1323 high confidence photometric
sources. Multiband photometry is matched with Yggdrasil models to estimate the
age, mass, and extinction of each cluster. A Schechter fit of the truncated
cluster mass function results in a characteristic mass ${\rm M_{*} = 1.6 \times
10^6 M_{\odot}}$. Our results confirm that intensely star-forming galaxies such
as Arp 299 host more massive clusters than quiescent dwarf and normal spirals.
In the case of NGC 3690E, we find that the cluster masses decrease with an
increasing galactocentric radius likely due to the gas density distribution. On
the other hand, the fitted age distributions of a mass-limited sample suggest
that YMCs of the western component undergo stronger disruption than those
hosted by the eastern galaxy. This is in agreement with the properties of the
underlying cluster luminosity functions: a clear truncation at high
luminosities with slopes generally shallower by $\sim 0.3$ dex than the ones of
the NGC 3690E. Finally, the derived cluster formation efficiency, $\Gamma \sim
19$ percent, indicates that Arp 299 has $\sim 3-5$ times more star formation
happening in bound clusters compared to the cases of gas-poor spirals like NGC
2997 and NGC 4395. The merger generally follows the $\Gamma - $ star formation
rate density relation from the literature. The YMC photometric study of Arp 299
thus reveals that both formation and disruption mechanisms of the star cluster

analyze interferometric (VLTI/PIONIER) and spectroscopic (VLT/UVES)

closure phases from the PIONIER data are particularly sensitive to rotational
flattening and GD. Adopting the Roche approximation, we investigate two GD
models: (1) the beta-model (classical von Zeipel's law), and (2) the
omega-model. Using this approach we measure several physical parameters of
Sargas, namely, equatorial radius, mass, equatorial rotation velocity, mean
Teff, inclination and position angle of the rotation axis, and beta. In
particular, we show that the measured beta leads to a surface flux distribution
equivalent to the one given by the omega-model. Thanks to our results, we also
show that Sargas is most probably located in a rare and interesting region of
the H-R diagram: within the Hertzsprung gap and over the hot edge of the
instability strip. These results show once more the power of optical/IR
long-baseline interferometry, combined with high-resolution spectroscopy, to
directly measure fast-rotation effects and stellar parameters, in particular
GD. As was the case for a few fast rotators previously studied by
interferometry, the omega-model provides a physically more profound description

LOSC DFA orbital energies to predict quasiparticle energies. This also leads to
the calculations of excitation energies of the $N$-electron systems from the

reduces the HTF matrix order from infinity to two or one, making the matrix
tractable mathematically without truncation or approximation. This theory is
applied to a droop-controlled voltage source inverter as an illustrative
example. A stability criterion is derived in the frequency-domain which agrees
with the conventional state-space model but offers greater insights into the
mechanism of instability in terms of the negative damping (non-passivity) under
droop control. The paper not only establishes a unified view in theory but also
offers an effective practical tool for stability assessment.

an experiment, with the aim of optimising cost and performance. For implicit
models, where the likelihood is intractable but sampling from the model is
possible, this task is particularly difficult and therefore largely unexplored.
This is mainly due to technical difficulties associated with approximating
posterior distributions and utility functions. We devise a novel experimental
design framework for implicit models that improves upon previous work in two
ways. First, we use the mutual information between parameters and data as the
utility function, which has previously not been feasible. We achieve this by
utilising Likelihood-Free Inference by Ratio Estimation (LFIRE) to approximate
posterior distributions, instead of the traditional approximate Bayesian
computation or synthetic likelihood methods. Secondly, we use Bayesian
optimisation in order to solve the optimal design problem, as opposed to the
typically used grid search or sampling-based methods. We find that this
increases efficiency and allows us to consider higher design dimensions.

spheroidal satellite galaxies (dSphs) typically entail searching for
annihilation signals above the astrophysical background. To robustly compare
model predictions with the observed fluxes of product particles, most analyses
of astrophysical data -- which are generally frequentist -- rely on estimating
the abundance of DM by calculating the so-called $\textit{J-factor}$. This
quantity is usually inferred from the kinematic properties of the stellar
population of a dSph using Jeans equation, commonly by means of Bayesian
techniques which entail the presence (and additional systematic uncertainty) of
prior choice. Here, extending earlier work, we develop a scheme to derive the
profile likelihood for $J$-factors of dwarf spheroidals for models with five or
more free parameters. We validate our method on a publicly available simulation
suite, released by the Gaia Challenge, finding satisfactory statistical
properties for coverage and bias. We present the profile likelihood function

illustration, we apply these profiles likelihood to recently published analyses
of gamma-ray data with the Fermi Large Area Telescope to derive new, consistent
upper limits on the DM annihilation cross-section. We do this for a subset of

understanding of these structures, a study of lipid membrane tension on DIB
membranes is measured by analysing the equilibrium shape of asymmetric DIBs. To
this end, the morphology of DIBs is explored for the first time using confocal
laser scanning fluorescence microscopy (CLSM). The experimental results confirm
that, in accordance with theory, the bilayer interface of a volume asymmetric
DIB is curved toward the smaller droplet and a lipid asymmetric DIB is curved
toward the droplet with the higher monolayer surface tension. Moreover, the DIB
shape can be exploited to measure complex bilayer surface energies. In this
study, the bilayer surface energy of DIBs composed of lipid mixtures of
phosphatidylgylcerol (PG) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) are shown to increase
linearly with PG concentrations up to 25%. The assumption that DIB bilayer area
can be geometrically approximated as a spherical cap base is also tested, and
it is discovered that the bilayer curvature is negligible for most practical

container; they flow; and they can be poured -- alcohol, oil and water as well
as a Lennard-Jones computer model exhibit similar behavior when poised in the
liquid phase. Here we identify a hitherto unstudied `phase' of matter, the
elixir phase, in a simple model of a polymeric chain whose backbone has the
correct local cylindrical symmetry induced by the tangent to the chain. The
elixir phase appears on breaking the cylindrical symmetry by adding side
spheres along the negative normal direction, as in proteins. This phase,
nestled between other phases, has multiple ground states made up of building
blocks of helices and almost planar sheets akin to protein native folds. We
discuss the similarities of this `phase' of a finite size system to the liquid
crystal and spin glass phases. Our findings are relevant for understanding
proteins; the creation of novel bio-inspired nano-machines; and also may have
implications for life elsewhere in the cosmos.

Lidov-Kozai oscillations. Solar-type MS quadruple star systems also show peaks
in their inner orbital period distributions at a few days. Here, we investigate
the natural question whether tidal evolution combined with secular evolution
can explain the observed inner orbital period distributions in quadruple stars.
We carry out population synthesis simulations of solar-type MS quadruple star
systems in both the 2+2 (two binaries orbiting each other's barycentre) and 3+1
(triple orbited by a fourth star) configurations. We take into account secular
gravitational and tidal evolution, and the effects of passing stars. We assume
that no short-period systems are formed initially, and truncate the initial
orbital period distributions below 10 d accordingly. We find that, due to
secular and tidal evolution, the inner orbital period distributions develop
tails at short periods. Although qualitatively consistent with the
observations, we find that our simulated orbital period distributions only
quantitatively agree with the observations for the 3+1 systems. The observed
2+2 systems, on the other hand, show an enhancement of systems around 10 d,
which is not reproduced in the simulations. This suggests that the inner
orbital periods of 2+2 systems are not predominantly shaped by tidal and
secular evolution, but by other processes, most likely occurring during the
stellar formation and early evolution.

T2 hosts a circumbinary disc with radius $\sim70-80\,\mathrm{AU}$ and mass
$\sim0.12\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. These circumbinary discs formed from the
disruption of circumstellar discs and harden the binary orbit. Our simulated
binaries launch large single outflows. We find that NT drives the most massive

produces the least efficient outflows concerning mass, momentum and angular
momentum ($\sim$61 per cent, $\sim$71 per cent, $\sim$68 per cent of the

circumbinary discs which organise magnetic fields for efficient outflow
launching, too much turbulence may also disrupt the ordered magnetic field
structure required for magneto-centrifugal launching of jets and outflows. We
also see evidence for episodic accretion during the binary star evolution. We
conclude that the role of turbulence in building large circumbinary discs may

typically associated with the motion of a specific point on the stellar surface
(e.g., polar cap). I start from long-term evolution (on the timescale when
instability significantly changes the spin frequency). For this case, I reduce
evolution equations to one differential equation and demonstrate that it can be
directly derived from energy conservation law. This equation governs evolution
rate through sequence of thermally equilibrium states and provides linear
coupling for the cooling power and rotation energy losses via gravitational
wave emission. In particular, it shows that differential rotation do not affect
long-term spin-down. On the contrary, on the short timescales, differential
rotation can significantly modify the apparent spin-down, if one examines a
strongly unstable star with very small initial amplitude of unstable mode. This
statement is confirmed by consideration of Newtonian non-magnetized perfect
fluid and dissipative stellar models as well as magnetized stellar model. For
example, despite that widely applied evolution equations predict effective spin
to be constant in absence of dissipation, the CFS-unstable star should be
observed as spinning-down. However, effects of differential rotation on
apparent spin-down are negligible for realistic models of neutron star
recycling, unless: (1) the neutron star is not magnetized, and (2) r-mode
amplitude is modulated faster than the shear viscosity dissipation timescale,
being large enough that spin-down can be measured on modulation timescale.

matter and its environment are out of equilibrium. Thus, the candidate planets
are dynamic inhomogeneous systems for two reasons. First, a planet receives
energy from its star, which leads to disequilibrium for external reasons.
Animate matter contributes to disequilibrium for internal reasons: accumulation
of matter and self-assembly. In practice, for a screening, an astrobiologist
should search for increase in inhomogeneity on a candidate planet.

  pages",,,,"cs.ET physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Oxide-based Random Access Memory (OxRAM), is part of the larger family of
Resistive RAM (RRAM) memories. Generally OxRAM cells consist of a transition
metal oxide (typically HfO2, Ta2O5, TiO2) sandwiched between two metal
electrodes (typically TiN, TaN, W but also Pt, Ir). This thesis describes the
experimental investigation performed on OxRAM memories during a 6-months
internship project at imec research institute (Leuven, Belgium). From previous
studies, HfO-based OxRAM memories showed good endurance properties (with more
than 10e9 write cycles), low operating current (as low as 10 uA), and very fast
switching (programming pulses of 100 ns). However, it has been observed that,
under low programming current condition, data stability becomes challenging.
Therefore, this programming state stability needed further investigation. This
thesis addresses the problem of state stability, first, by presenting the
equipment and algorithms used to study OxRAM state loss over short time
intervals. Secondly, various experiments and tests are performed searching for
a key parameter in order to control memory retention. Finally, this work
demonstrates that resistance evolution over time is affected by both a
determinist drift (logarithmically dependent on time) and a random stochastic
fluctuation component. It also demonstrates that this behavior is intrinsic in
the nature of the device itself and does not depend on processing issues or
variation in the programming conditions. This experimental study proved the
intrinsic nature of the program instability phenomena in OxRAM devices, which
in turns leads to the ineffectiveness of verify algorithm for low current
operation.

gestures and they are fed to unidirectional left-to-right Hidden Markov Model

proposed. Finally, shapes corresponding to these gestures are rendered over the

difference scheme of the model equation is used to construct a multiscale flux

meta-information. However, the Web's vast information space can only be handled
effectively, when resources are meaningfully classified into coherent
conceptual structures.
  The automatic classification of resource meta-information is at the heart of
the WAVE system, which employs methods from the mathematical theory of concept
analysis to analyze and interactively explore the vast information space
defined by wide area resource discovery services. In this paper we discuss
these methods by interpreting various synoptic and summary interchange formats
for resource meta-information, such as the Harvest SOIF and the Whois++ urc, in
terms of basic ideas from concept analysis. In so doing, we advocate concept
analysis as a principled approach to effective resource discovery.

learning problem, where a player repeatedly chooses to perform an action, pays
the corresponding cost, and receives a reward associated with the action. The
player is constrained by the maximum budget $B$ that can be spent to perform
actions, and the rewards and the costs of the actions are assigned by an
adversary. This problem has only been studied in the restricted setting where
the reward of an action is greater than the cost of the action, while we
provide a solution in the general setting. Namely, we propose EXP3.BwK, a novel
algorithm that achieves order optimal regret. We also propose EXP3++.BwK, which
is order optimal in the adversarial BwK setup, and incurs an almost optimal
expected regret with an additional factor of $\log(B)$ in the stochastic BwK
setup. Finally, we investigate the case of having large costs for the actions
(i.e., they are comparable to the budget size $B$), and show that for the
adversarial setting, achievable regret bounds can be significantly worse,
compared to the case of having costs bounded by a constant, which is a common
assumption within the BwK literature.

  capabilities for large-scale HTS systems","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1811.09193",,,,"physics.app-ph physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The emergence of second-generation high temperature superconducting tapes has
favored the development of large-scale superconductor systems. The mathematical
models for superconductors have evolved from simple analytical models to
complex numerical models. The available analytical models are just capable of
estimating electromagnetic quantities in single wires or small arrays. The
numerical models like the H formulation finite element models are useful for
the analysis of more medium-size systems, but their application in large-scale
systems is problematic due to the excessive cost in terms of memory and the
computation time. Then it is necessary to devise new strategies to tackle this
challenge. The homogenization and the multi-scale approach are methodologies
that have successfully simplified the description of the systems allowing the
study of large-scale systems. Recently, efficient calculations have been
achieved using the T-A formulation. In this manuscript, we analyze the adequate
order of the elements used in the T-A formulation. More importantly, we propose
a series of adaptations to the homogenization and multi-scale methodologies in
order to allow their implementation to the T-A formulation models. The proposed
strategies are validated by means of comparing them with the H reference model
of a racetrack coil. The computation time and memory demand are substantially
reduced up to a point that makes it possible to perform real-time simulations
for slow ramping cycles. At the same time the comparison demonstrates a very
good agreement with respect to the reference model, both at a local and global
level, is achieved.

attention of the research community to build intrusion detection systems (IDS)
that can detect anomalies in the network traffic. Most of the research works,
however, do not differentiate among different types of attacks. This is, in
fact, necessary for appropriate countermeasures and defense against attacks. In
this paper, we investigate both detecting and categorizing anomalies rather
than just detecting, which is a common trend in the contemporary research
works. We have used a popular publicly available dataset to build and test
learning models for both detection and categorization of different attacks. To
be precise, we have used two supervised machine learning techniques, namely
linear regression (LR) and random forest (RF). We show that even if detection
is perfect, categorization can be less accurate due to similarities between
attacks. Our results demonstrate more than 99% detection accuracy and
categorization accuracy of 93.6%, with the inability to categorize some
attacks. Further, we argue that such categorization can be applied to
multi-cloud environments using the same machine learning techniques.

execution of blockchain transactions to events coming from external oracles,

by essence non-reliable, since transaction execution can be triggered by
information whose veracity cannot be established by the blockchain. To overcome
this problem, the language features a first-order logic and an authority
algebra to allow formal reasoning and establish accountability of agents for
blockchain-enabled transactions. We provide an accountability model that allows
to formally prove the accountability of agents by a formal proof locally
executable by each agent of the blockchain.
