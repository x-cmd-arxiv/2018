readily accessible in any simulation so that they can be visualized and

extend equally to reliably establishing the origin of the {\it apparent} global

that the measurements of the monopole component of the spectrum of interest

between the intrinsic monopole spectrum and the differential spectrum as an
imprint of dipole anisotropy resulting from motion of observer with respect to
the rest frame of our source (such as that of our Solar system, interpreted

graphs under fixed lattice representations. A periodic graph is
vertex-redundantly rigid if the deletion of a single vertex orbit under the
periodicity results in a periodically rigid graph. Our proof is similar to the
one of Tanigawa, but there are some added difficulties. First, it is not known
whether periodic global rigidity is a generic property. This issue is resolved
via a slight modification of a recent result of Kaszanitzy, Schulze and
Tanigawa (2016). Secondly, while the rigidity of finite graphs in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ on at most $d$ vertices obviously implies their global rigidity,
it is non-trivial to prove a similar result for periodic graphs. This is
accomplished by extending a result of Bezdek and Connelly (2002) on the
existence of a continuous movement between two equivalent $d$-dimensional
realisations of a single graph in $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$ to periodic frameworks.

semantically similar objects from different modality is one of the heart
problems of multi-modal learning. Most of the current methods try to learn the
inter-modal correlation with extrinsic supervised information, while intrinsic
structural information of each modality is neglected. The performance of these
methods heavily depends on the richness of training samples. However, obtaining
the multi-modal training samples is still a labor and cost intensive work. In
this paper, we bring a extrinsic correlation between the space structures of
each modalities in coreference resolution. With this correlation, a
semi-supervised learning model for multi-modal coreference resolution is
proposed. We firstly extract high-level features of images and text, then
compute the distances of each object from some reference points to build the
space structure of each modality. With a shared reference point set, the space
structures of each modality are correlated. We employ the correlation to build
a commonly shared space that the semantic distance between multi-modal objects
can be computed directly. The experiments on two multi-modal datasets show that
our model performs better than the existing methods with insufficient training
data.

algorithm for MVM on bipartite graphs by restricting the length of augmenting
paths to at most three. The latter algorithm has time complexity $O(|E| + |V|

  The approximation algorithm solves two MVM problems on bipartite graphs, each
with weights only on one vertex part, and then finds a matching from these two
matchings using the Mendelsohn-Dulmage Theorem. The approximation ratio of the
algorithm is obtained by considering failed vertices, i.e., vertices that the

that at every step of the algorithm there are two distinct heavier vertices

applications beyond markets, such as scheduling, fair allocation of goods, or
bandwidth distribution in networks. Computation of competitive equilibria has
received a significant amount of interest in algorithmic game theory, mainly
for the prominent case of Fisher markets. Natural and decentralized processes
like tatonnement and proportional response dynamics (PRD) converge quickly
towards equilibrium in large classes of Fisher markets. Almost all of the
literature assumes that the market is a static environment and that the
parameters of agents and goods do not change over time. In contrast, many large
real-world markets are subject to frequent and dynamic changes. In this paper,
we provide the first provable performance guarantees of discrete-time
tatonnement and PRD in markets that are subject to perturbation over time. We
analyze the prominent class of Fisher markets with CES utilities and quantify
the impact of changes in supplies of goods, budgets of agents, and utility
functions of agents on the convergence of tatonnement to market equilibrium.
Since the equilibrium becomes a dynamic object and will rarely be reached, our
analysis provides bounds expressing the distance to equilibrium that will be
maintained via tatonnement and PRD updates. Our results indicate that in many
cases, tatonnement and PRD follow the equilibrium rather closely and quickly
recover conditions of approximate market clearing. Our approach can be
generalized to analyzing a general class of Lyapunov dynamical systems with
changing system parameters, which might be of independent interest.

negative feedback loop preventing an unlimited growth of consumption due to
finite biophysical resources of our planet. This simple dynamic model allows
for derivation of the expression describing the declining long-term tail of a
social discount curve. The latter plays a critical role in, e.g., climate
finance with benefits on current investments deferred to centuries from now.
The growth rate of consumption is irregularly evolving in time, which makes
estimation of an expected term-structure of consumption growth and associated
social discount rates a challenging task. Nonetheless, observations show that
the problem at hand is perturbative with the small parameter being the product
of an average strength of fluctuations in the growth rate and its
autocorrelation time. This fact permits utilization of the cumulant expansion
method to derive remarkably simple expressions for the term-structure of
expected consumption growth and associated discount rates in the bounded
economy. Comparison with empirical data shows that the dynamic effect related
to the planetary resource constrains could become a dominant mechanism
responsible for a declining long-term tail of a social discount curve at the
time horizon estimated here as about100 years from now (the lower boundary).
The derived results can help to shape a more realistic long-term social
discounting policy. Furthermore, with the obvious redefinition of the key
parameters of the model, obtained results are directly applicable for
description of expected long-term population growth in stochastic environments.

generation station should be carefully maintained and their operation has to be
monitored such that any damage on them is avoided. Otherwise, the generating
station might experience frequent shut downs which results in electricity
generation interruptions and high costs associated with repairing and
compensation of lack of energy. In this sense, many protective schemes focusing
on a variety of synchronous generator faults have already been proposed and are
still modified and developed to further enhance the quality of protection. In
this thesis, synchronous generator stator windings to ground fault is studied
as one of the most common and crucial faults in these machines. Numerous
methods of stator winding to ground fault protection schemes are also reported
in the literature. Third harmonic differential voltage and sub-harmonic schemes
are studied in this research. A novel adaptive scheme for both methods is
modelled and implemented in a comprehensive lab scale set-up where a real
generation unit is scaled down including all different components and
apparatus. The simulation model is also established based on simultaneous
finite element analysis (FEA) and coupled magnetic circuit to assist with
system configuration design and parameter selections. The adaptive scheme is
proved to be capable of detecting stator windings to ground faults based on
actual experimental data. Finally, the proposed adaptive scheme is compared
against other available non-adaptive protection schemes currently used in
industrial relays. Several important performance evaluation criteria in
protection schemes such as sensitivity and security of operation referred to as
reliability are considered. It is shown that the adaptive scheme offers higher
reliability than other schemes which emphasizes its credibility and
applicability.

two merge into one. For example, in the honey-drop formation when honey
dripping from a spoon, honey is extended to separate into two as the liquid
neck bridging them thins down to micron scales. At the moment when topology
changes due to the breakup, physical observables such as surface curvature
locally diverges. Such singular dynamics have widely attracted physicists,
revealing universality in their self-similar dynamics, which share much in
common with critical phenomena in thermodynamics. Many experimental examples
have been found, which include electric spout and vibration-induced jet
eruption. However, only a few cases have been physically understood on the
basis of equations that govern the singular dynamics and even in such a case
the physical understanding is mathematically complicated inevitably involving
delicate numerical calculations. Here, we study breakup of air film entrained
by a solid disk into viscous liquid in a confined space, which leads to
formation, thinning and breakup of the neck of air. As a result, we
unexpectedly find that equations governing the neck dynamics can be solved
analytically by virtue of two remarkable experimental features: only a single
length scale linearly dependent on time remains near the singularity and
universal scaling functions describing singular neck shape and velocity field
are both analytic. The present solvable case would be essential for our better
understanding of the singular dynamics and will help unveil the physics of
unresolved examples intimately related to daily-life phenomena and diverse

long narrow channel is studied on the basis of linearized compressible
Navier-Stokes equations with no-slip condition. The Helmholtz decomposition
theorem is used to decompose the velocity field into an irrotational part and a
solenoidal part. The irrotational velocity is driven by the fluid's volumetric
expansion whilst the role of the solenoidal velocity is to enforce the no-slip
condition for the overall velocity and it does not contribute to the mass flow
rate. It is found that at large times this no-slip flow exhibits a
time-dependent slip-like mass flow rate linearly proportional to the channel
gap instead of the cubic power of the gap from the Poiseuille-type of flow. The
drainage rate is also proportional to the kinematic viscosity, opposite to
Poiseuille-type of flow which has a drainage rate proportional to the inverse
of the kinematic viscosity. The same drainage rate formula also applies to
drainage flow from a semi-sealed microchannel.

system (CNS). A reliable measure of the tissue myelin content is therefore
essential for the understanding of the physiopathology of MS, tracking
progression and assessing treatment efficacy. Positron emission tomography
(PET) with $[^{11} \mbox{C}] \mbox{PIB}$ has been proposed as a promising
biomarker for measuring myelin content changes in-vivo in MS. However, PET
imaging is expensive and invasive due to the injection of a radioactive tracer.
On the contrary, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive, widely
available technique, but existing MRI sequences do not provide, to date, a
reliable, specific, or direct marker of either demyelination or remyelination.
In this work, we therefore propose Sketcher-Refiner Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) with specifically designed adversarial loss functions to
predict the PET-derived myelin content map from a combination of MRI
modalities. The prediction problem is solved by a sketch-refinement process in
which the sketcher generates the preliminary anatomical and physiological
information and the refiner refines and generates images reflecting the tissue
myelin content in the human brain. We evaluated the ability of our method to
predict myelin content at both global and voxel-wise levels. The evaluation
results show that the demyelination in lesion regions and myelin content in
normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) can be well predicted by our method. The
method has the potential to become a useful tool for clinical management of
patients with MS.

inferior performance on unseen test examples compared to performance on

have shown superior performance compared to deterministic weight penalties on a

Shakeout, in expectation, are equivalent to imposing a ridge and elastic-net

of weight penalty is problem dependent and is not restricted to $\{L_1,L_2\}$.
Therefore, in this paper we propose the Bridgeout stochastic regularization
technique and prove that it is equivalent to an $L_q$ penalty on the weights,

results show that Bridgeout results in sparse model weights, improved gradients

photovoltaic material has attracted a great deal of recent interest. Factors
that are important in their application in optoelectronic devices include their
fractional contribution of the composition of the materials as well as their
microscopic arrangement that is responsible for the formation of well-defined
macroscopic structures. CH3NH3PbBr3 assumes different polymorphs (orthorhombic,
tetragonal and cubic) depending on the evolution temperature of the bulk
material. Density functional theory calculations have been performed on
polymorphs of CH3NH3PbBr3 to demonstrate that the H atoms on C of the methyl
group in MA entrapped within a MAPbBr3 perovskite cage are not electronically
innocent, as is often contended. We show here that these H atoms are involved
in attractive interactions with the surrounding bromides of corner-sharing
octahedra of the CH3NH3PbBr3 cage to form Br...H(-C) hydrogen bonding
interactions. This is analogous to the way the H atoms on N of the ammonium
group in MA form Br...H(-N) hydrogen bonding interactions to stabilize the
structure of CH3NH3PbBr3. Both these hydrogen bonding interactions are shown to
persist regardless of the nature of the three polymorphic forms of CH3NH3PbBr3.
These, together with the Br...C(-N) carbon bonding, the Br...N(-C) pnictogen
bonding, and the Br...Br lump-hole type intermolecular non-covalent
interactions identified for the first time in this study, are shown to be
collectively responsible for the eventual emergence of the orthorhombic
geometry of the CH3NH3PbBr3 system. These conclusions are arrived at from a
systematic analysis of the results obtained from combined DFT, Quantum Theory
of Atoms in Molecules, and Reduced Density Gradient Non-Covalent Interaction
calculations carried out on the three temperature-dependent polymorphic
geometries of CH3NH3PbBr3.

eats, it can wander $\mathcal{S}$ additional steps without food before starving
to death. When the forager does not eat, either by not detecting food on a full

time unit closer to starvation. As the forager wanders, a multiply connected
spatial region where food has been consumed---a desert---is created. The
forager lifetime depends non-monotonically on its degree of myopia $p$, and at
the optimal myopia $p=p^*(\mathcal{S})$, the forager lives much longer than a

end-to-end speech recognition as an extension of a multi-head attention model.
In the multi-head attention model, multiple attentions are calculated, and
then, they are integrated into a single attention. On the other hand, instead
of the integration in the attention level, our proposed method uses multiple
decoders for each attention and integrates their outputs to generate a final
output. Furthermore, in order to make each head to capture the different
modalities, different attention functions are used for each head, leading to
the improvement of the recognition performance with an ensemble effect. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct an experimental

opportunities they offer for advancing medical informatics, there has been
growing interest in mining EHR for improving quality of care. Disease diagnosis
due to its sensitive nature, huge costs of error, and complexity has become an
increasingly important focus of research in past years. Existing studies model
EHR by capturing co-occurrence of clinical events to learn their latent
embeddings. However, relations among clinical events carry various semantics
and contribute differently to disease diagnosis which gives precedence to a
more advanced modeling of heterogeneous data types and relations in EHR data
than existing solutions. To address these issues, we represent how
high-dimensional EHR data and its rich relationships can be suitably translated
into HeteroMed, a heterogeneous information network for robust medical
diagnosis. Our modeling approach allows for straightforward handling of missing
values and heterogeneity of data. HeteroMed exploits metapaths to capture
higher level and semantically important relations contributing to disease
diagnosis. Furthermore, it employs a joint embedding framework to tailor
clinical event representations to the disease diagnosis goal. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to use Heterogeneous Information Network
for modeling clinical data and disease diagnosis. Experimental results of our
study show superior performance of HeteroMed compared to prior methods in
prediction of exact diagnosis codes and general disease cohorts. Moreover,
HeteroMed outperforms baseline models in capturing similarities of clinical
events which are examined qualitatively through case studies.

the groin or an artery in the wrist. Because clinical trials have indicated
that access via the wrist may result in fewer post procedure complications,
shortening the length of stay, and ultimately cost less than groin access,
adoption of access via the wrist has been encouraged. However, patients treated
in usual care are likely to differ from those participating in clinical trials,

differ between males and females. Moreover, the choice of artery access
strategy is likely to be influenced by patient or physician unmeasured factors.
To study the effectiveness of the two artery access site strategies on
hospitalization charges, we use data from a state-mandated clinical registry

redshift bias that depends on the [NII]/H$\alpha$ ratio, which is correlated
with a galaxy's metallicity, hence mass and ultimately environment. We
investigate how this bias propagates into the galaxy clustering and
cosmological parameters obtained from the WFIRST. Using simulation, we explore
the effect of line blending on redshift-space distortion and baryon acoustic
oscillation (BAO) measurements. We measure the BAO parameters
$\alpha_{\parallel}$, $\alpha_{\perp}$, the logarithmic growth factor $f_{v}$,
and calculate their errors based on the correlations between the line ratio and
large-scale structure. We find $\Delta\alpha_{\parallel} = 0.31 \pm 0.23 \%$

of the systematic error budget in a root-sum-square sense. These errors may
already be tolerable but further mitigations are discussed. Biases due to the
environment-independent redshift error can be mitigated by measuring the
redshift error probability distribution function. High-spectral-resolution
re-observation of a few thousand galaxies would be required (if by direct
approach) to reduce them to below 25$\%$ of the error budget. Finally, we
outline the next steps to improve the modeling of [NII]-induced blending biases

including stochasticity in both the arrival process and the matching process.
The Online Stochastic Matching with Timeouts problem introduced by Bansal, et
al., (Algorithmica, 2012) models matching markets (e.g., E-Bay, Amazon). Buyers
arrive from an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) known
distribution on buyer profiles and can be shown a list of items one at a time.
Each buyer has some probability of purchasing each item and a limit (timeout)
on the number of items they can be shown.
  Bansal et al., (Algorithmica, 2012) gave a 0.12-competitive algorithm which
was improved by Adamczyk, et al., (ESA, 2015) to 0.24. We present an online
attenuation framework that uses an algorithm for offline stochastic matching as
a black box. On the upper bound side, we show that this framework, combined
with a black-box adapted from Bansal et al., (Algorithmica, 2012), yields an
online algorithm which nearly doubles the ratio to 0.46. On the lower bound
side, we show that no algorithm can achieve a ratio better than 0.632 using the
standard LP for this problem. This framework has a high potential for further
improvements since new algorithms for offline stochastic matching can directly
improve the ratio for the online problem.
  Our online framework also has the potential for a variety of extensions. For
example, we introduce a natural generalization: Online Stochastic Matching with
Two-sided Timeouts in which both online and offline vertices have timeouts. Our
framework provides the first algorithm for this problem achieving a ratio of
0.30. We once again use the algorithm of Adamczyk et al., (ESA, 2015) as a

learning models on parameter server (PS) is the communication overhead, because
it needs to frequently exchange the model gradients between the workers and
servers during the training iterations. Gradient quantization has been proposed
as an effective approach to reducing the communication volume. One key issue in
gradient quantization is setting the number of bits for quantizing the
gradients. Small number of bits can significantly reduce the communication
overhead while hurts the gradient accuracies, and vise versa. An ideal
quantization method would dynamically balance the communication overhead and
model accuracy, through adjusting the number bits according to the knowledge
learned from the immediate past training iterations. Existing methods, however,
quantize the gradients either with fixed number of bits, or with predefined
heuristic rules. In this paper we propose a novel adaptive quantization method
within the framework of reinforcement learning. The method, referred to as
MQGrad, formalizes the selection of quantization bits as actions in a Markov
decision process (MDP) where the MDP states records the information collected
from the past optimization iterations (e.g., the sequence of the loss function
values). During the training iterations of a machine learning algorithm, MQGrad
continuously updates the MDP state according to the changes of the loss
function. Based on the information, MDP learns to select the optimal actions
(number of bits) to quantize the gradients. Experimental results based on a
benchmark dataset showed that MQGrad can accelerate the learning of a large
scale deep neural network while keeping its prediction accuracies.

coin ""cluster-induced deagglomeration."" Specifically, we examine relatively
dilute gas-solid flows and isolate agglomerates of cohesive origin from overall
heterogeneities in the system, i.e., agglomerates of cohesive origin and
clusters of hydrodynamic origin. We observe enhanced clustering with an
increasing system size (as is the norm for noncohesive systems) as well as
reduced agglomeration. The reduced agglomeration is traced to the increased
collisional impact velocities of particles at the surface of a cluster; i.e.,
higher levels of clustering lead to larger relative velocities between the
clustered and nonclustered regions, thereby serving as an additional source of
granular temperature. This physical picture is further evidenced by a
theoretical model based on a balance between the generation and breakage rates
of agglomerates. Finally, cluster-induced deagglomeration also provides an
explanation for a surprising saturation of agglomeration levels in
gravity-driven, gas-solid systems with increasing levels of cohesion, as
opposed to the monotonically increasing behavior seen in free-evolving or
driven granular systems in the absence of gravity. Namely, higher cohesion
leads to more energy dissipation, which is associated with competing effects:
enhanced agglomeration and enhanced clustering, the latter of which results in
more cluster-induced deagglomeration.

semileptonic decays, the measurements depend strongly on the tag efficiency of
the $B$ meson in the recoil side which is at a few per mille to a few per cent
level, and this values a limiting factor for high precision measurement and
high sensitivity test mentioned above. We develop a novel method of
reconstructing semileptonic decays of the $B$ mesons by introducing the $B$
momentum information calculated from the $B$ decay vertex and the interaction
point, as well as the kinematic information of $e^{+}e^{-}\to B\overline{B}$ at
the $B$-factories such as BaBar, Belle, and Belle II. As this method does not
depend on the reconstruction of the $B$ meson in the recoil side, the gain in
the efficiency could be as large as two orders of magnitudes. This makes high
precision measurement of CKM-matrix elements $|V_{cb}|$ and $|V_{ub}|$ and high
precision test of lepton universality at $B$-factories more promising. We
present the algorithms for the semileptonic decays of neutral and charged $B$
mesons separately, as they are affected by the magnetic field in the detector
differently.

This call for tools and techniques that can help in providing guarantees about

towards this goal. In particular, reducing the gap between typical features of
an MRS and the level of abstraction of the linguistic primitives would simplify
both the specification of these systems and the verification of their
properties. In this work, we review different agent-oriented languages and
their features; we then consider a selection of case studies of interest and
implement them useing the surveyed languages. We also evaluate and compare
effectiveness of the proposed solution, considering, in particular, easiness of

gravitational potential for test particles. 'What is the gravitational
potential induced by black holes with a cosmological constant (Schwarzschild-de
Sitter (S-dS) metric) on finite thickness global topological defects?'. This is
the main question addressed in the present analysis. We also discuss the
validity of Derrick's theorem when scalar fields are embedded in non-trivial
gravitational backgrounds. In the context of the above question, we consider
three global defect configurations: a finite thickness spherical domain wall
with a central S-dS black hole, a global string loop with a S-dS black hole in
the center and a global monopole near a S-dS black hole. Using an analytical
model and numerical simulations of the evolving spherical wall we show that the
spherical wall experiences a repelling gravitational potential due to the mass
of the central black hole. This potential is further amplified by the presence
of a cosmological constant. For initial domain wall radius larger than a
critical value, the repulsive potential dominates over the wall tension and the
wall expands towards the cosmological horizon of the S-dS metric where it
develops ghost instabilities. For smaller initial radius, tension dominates and
the wall contracts towards the black hole horizon where it also develops ghost
instabilities. We also show, using the same analytical model and energetic
arguments that a global monopole is gravitationally attracted by a black hole
while a cosmological constant induces a repulsive gravitational potential as in
the case of test particles. Finally we show that a global string loop with
finite thickness experiences gravitational repulsion due to the cosmological
constant which dominates over its tension for a radius larger than a critical
radius leading to an expanding rather than contracting loop.

principles underpinning the normalization of proofs. ""Subatomic"" means that we
can reformulate logical systems in accordance with two principles. Their atomic
formulas become instances of sub-atoms, non-commutative self-dual relations
among logical constants, and their rules are derivable by means of a unique
deductive scheme, the medial shape. One of the results is that the
cut-elimination of subatomic systems implies the cut-elimination of every
standard system we can represent sub-atomically.
  We here introduce Subatomic systems-1.1. They relax and widen the properties
that the sub-atoms of Subatomic systems can satisfy while maintaining the use
of the medial shape as their only inference principle. Since sub-atoms can
operate directly on variables we introduce P. The cut-elimination of P is a
corollary of the cut-elimination that we prove for Subatomic systems-1.1.
Moreover, P is sound and complete with respect to the clone at the top of
Post's Lattice. I.e. P proves all and only the tautologies that contain
conjunctions, disjunctions and projections. So, P extends Propositional logic
without any encoding of its atoms as sub-atoms of P.
  This shows that the logical principles underpinning Subatomic systems also
apply outside the sub-atomic level which they are conceived to work at. We
reinforce this point of view by introducing the set R of medial shapes. The
formulas that the rules in R deal with belong to the union of two disjoint
clones of Post's Lattice. The SAT-problem of the first clone is in P-Time. The
SAT-problem of the other is NP-Time complete. So, R and the proof technology of
Subatomic systems could help to identify proof-theoretical properties that
highlight the phase transition from P-Time to NP-Time complete satisfiability.

by which changes of the local mechanical stresses affect growth is called a

the coupling between mechanics and geometry in growing and evolving biological

common in biology (e.g. arteries, plant stems, airways) and model the
homeostasis-driven growth dynamics of tubes which produces spatially
inhomogeneous residual stress. We show that the stability of the homeostatic

$\gamma$-rays below $\approx 2.5$ MeV. Shell-model calculations indicate that
this feature is caused by strong, low-energy $M1$ transitions at high
excitation energies. The nuclear level density and $\gamma$-ray strength
function have been extracted from $^{89}$Y($d,p \gamma$)$^{90}$Y coincidences
using the Oslo method. Using the ($\gamma,n$) and ($d,p\gamma$) data as
experimental constraints, we have calculated the $^{89}$Y($n,\gamma$)$^{90}$Y
cross section with the TALYS reaction code. Our results have been compared with
directly measured (n,$\gamma$) cross sections and evaluations. The $N=50$
isotope $^{89}$Y is an important bottleneck in the s-process and the magnitude
of the $^{89}$Y(n,$\gamma)$ cross section is key to understanding how s-process
stars produce heavy isotopes.

A$^{*}$ at the center of the Milky Way in dark matter halos. For the Cold Dark
Matter and Scalar Field Dark Matter models considered in this work, the
apparent shape of the shadow depends upon the black hole spin $a$ and the dark
matter parameter $k$. We find that both dark matter models influence the shadow
in a similar way. The shadow is a perfect circle in the non-rotating case
($a=0$) and a deformed one in the rotating case ($a\neq0$). The size of the
shadow increases with increasing $k$ in both non-rotating and rotating cases,
while the shadow gets more and more distorted with increasing $a$ in the
rotating case. We further investigate the black hole emission rate in both dark
matter halos. We find that the emission rate decreases with increasing $k$ and
the peak of the emission shifts to lower frequency. Finally, by calculating the
angular radius of the shadow, we estimate that the dark matter halo could
influence the shadow of Sgr A$^{*}$ at a level of order of magnitude of
$10^{-3}$ $\mu$as and $10^{-5}$ $\mu$as, for CDM and SFDM, respectively. Future
astronomical instruments with high angular resolution would be able to observe
this effect and shed light on the nature of Sgr A$^{*}$. More interestingly, it
may be possible to distinguish between CDM and SFDM models given the
resolutions required differing by two orders of magnitude from each other.

  Random Regular Graphs",,,,,"cs.DM cs.DS math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of sampling from the Potts model on random regular
graphs. It is conjectured that sampling is possible when the temperature of the
model is in the uniqueness regime of the regular tree, but positive algorithmic
results have been for the most part elusive. In this paper, for all integers
$q\geq 3$ and $\Delta\geq 3$, we develop algorithms that produce samples within
error $o(1)$ from the $q$-state Potts model on random $\Delta$-regular graphs,
whenever the temperature is in uniqueness, for both the ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic cases.
  The algorithm for the antiferromagnetic Potts model is based on iteratively
adding the edges of the graph and resampling a bichromatic class that contains
the endpoints of the newly added edge. Key to the algorithm is how to perform
the resampling step efficiently since bichromatic classes may induce
linear-sized components. To this end, we exploit the tree uniqueness to show
that the average growth of bichromatic components is typically small, which
allows us to use correlation decay algorithms for the resampling step. While
the precise uniqueness threshold on the tree is not known for general values of
$q$ and $\Delta$ in the antiferromagnetic case, our algorithm works throughout
uniqueness regardless of its value.
  In the case of the ferromagnetic Potts model, we simplify the algorithm
significantly by utilising the random-cluster representation of the model. In
particular, we show that a percolation-type algorithm succeeds in sampling from
the random-cluster model with parameters $p,q$ on random $\Delta$-regular
graphs for all values of $q\geq 1$ and $p<p_c(q,\Delta)$, where $p_c(q,\Delta)$
corresponds to a uniqueness threshold for the model on the $\Delta$-regular
tree. When restricted to integer values of $q$, this yields a simplified
algorithm for the ferromagnetic Potts model on random $\Delta$-regular graphs.

by a power method, the technical challenge is the computation of more damped
higher-order eigenmodes. This challenge is addressed by a novel method to
compute unstable periodically forced solutions of the linearized Navier-Stokes
solution. This method utilizes two key enablers. First, the linear dynamics is
transformed by a complex shift of the eigenvalues amplifying the flow response
at the given frequency of interest. Second, the growth rate is obtained from an
iteration procedure. The method is demonstrated for several wake flows around a
circular cylinder, a fluidic pinball, i.e. the wake behind a cluster of
cylinders, a wall-mounted cylinder, a sphere and a delta wing. The example of
flow control with periodic wake actuation and forced physical modes paves the
way for applications of physical modal expansions. These results encourage
Galerkin models of three-dimensional flows utilizing Navier-Stokes based modes.

extremely unacceptable if a target corpus has no hidden bias, and the second
phase is to test the null hypothesis using a Naive Bayes model. The
experimental result of the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus
does not reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, it indicates that the SNLI

classical computers for searching in an arbitrary data set, a scenario that
describes Bitcoin mining. It has previously been argued that the only
side-effect of quantum mining would be an increased difficulty.
  In this work, we argue that a crucial argument in the analysis of Bitcoin
security breaks down when quantum mining is performed.
  Classically, a Bitcoin fork occurs rarely, i.e., when two miners find a block
almost simultaneously, due to propagation time effects. The situation differs
dramatically when quantum miners use Grover's algorithm, which repeatedly
applies a procedure called a Grover iteration. The chances of finding a block
grow quadratically with the number of Grover iterations applied. Crucially, a
miner does not have to choose how many iterations to apply in advance. Suppose
Alice receives Bob's new block. To maximize her revenue, she should stop and
measure her state immediately in the hopes that her block (rather than Bob's)
will become part of the longest chain. The strong correlation between the
miners' actions and the fact that they all measure their states at the same
time may lead to more forks -- which is known to be a security risk for
Bitcoin. We propose a mechanism that, we conjecture, will prevent this form of
quantum mining, thereby circumventing the high rate of forks.

cellular network is a suitable candidate for enabling such connectivity, and
how the inclusion of aerial UEs might impact the overall network efficiency.
This paper provides an in-depth analysis of user and network level performance
of a cellular network that serves both unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and
ground users in the downlink. Our results show that the favorable propagation
conditions that UAVs enjoy due to their height often backfire on them, as the
increased co-channel interference received from neighboring ground BSs is not
compensated by the improved signal strength. When compared with a ground user
in an urban area, our analysis shows that a UAV flying at 100 meters can
experience a throughput decrease of a factor 10 and a coverage drop from 76% to
30%. Motivated by these findings, we develop UAV and network based solutions to
enable an adequate integration of UAVs into cellular networks. In particular,
we show that an optimal tilting of the UAV antenna can increase their coverage
and throughput from 23% to 89% and from 3.5 b/s/Hz to 5.8 b/s/Hz, respectively,
outperforming ground UEs. Furthermore, our findings reveal that depending on
UAV altitude, the aerial user performance can scale with respect to the network
density better than that of a ground user. Finally, our results show that
network densification and the use of micro cells limit UAV performance. While
UAV usage has the potential to increase area spectral efficiency (ASE) of
cellular networks with moderate number of cells, they might hamper the
development of future ultra dense networks.

equivalent to $N$ and $\eta=x^\star\bar\eta$ its pull back on $M$. We introduce
and study for a given non vanishing function $\alpha$ on $M$ the so-called
$\alpha$-associated (semi-)Riemannian metric $ g_{\alpha}=g+\alpha\eta\otimes
\eta$. For a closed rigging $N$ we give a constructive method to find an
$\alpha$-associated metric whose Levi-Civita connection coincides with the
connection $\nabla$ induced on $M$ by the Levi-Civita connection
$\overline{\nabla}$ of $\overline{M}$ and the null rigging $N$. We relate
geometric objects of ${g}_{\alpha}$ to those of $g$ and $\overline{g}$. As
application, we show that given a null Monge hypersurface $M$ in $\R_q^{n+1},$
there always exists a rigging and an $\alpha$-associated metric whose
Levi-Civita connection coincides with the induced connection on $M$.

engineering applications, but it is challenging to solve such problems. In this
study, a new resolution method based on the directional Bat Algorithm (dBA) is
presented. To overcome the difficulties in the evaluations of probabilistic
constraints, the reliable design space concept has been applied to convert the
yielded stochastic constrained optimization problem from the RBDO formulation
into a deterministic constrained optimization problem. In addition, the
constraint handling technique has also been introduced to the dBA so that the
algorithm can solve constrained optimization problem effectively. The new
method has been applied to several engineering problems and the results show
that the new method can solve different varieties of RBDO problems efficiently.
In fact, the obtained solutions are consistent with the best results in the
literature.

classification tasks while being more difficult to train. Due to the complexity
and vanishing gradient problem, it normally takes a lot of time and more
computational power to train deeper neural networks. Deep residual networks
(ResNets) can make the training process faster and attain more accuracy
compared to their equivalent neural networks. ResNets achieve this improvement
by adding a simple skip connection parallel to the layers of convolutional
neural networks. In this project we first design a ResNet model that can
perform the image classification task on the Tiny ImageNet dataset with a high
accuracy, then we compare the performance of this ResNet model with its
equivalent Convolutional Network (ConvNet). Our findings illustrate that
ResNets are more prone to overfitting despite their higher accuracy. Several
methods to prevent overfitting such as adding dropout layers and stochastic
augmentation of the training dataset has been studied in this work.

approximate analytical solutions to KP model are represented by using the

of the KP system causes the application of these two methods to require more

intelligence and inspiration from the echolocation behavior of bats. One of the
issues in the standard bat algorithm is the premature convergence that can
occur due to the low exploration ability of the algorithm under some
conditions. To overcome this deficiency, directional echolocation is introduced
to the standard bat algorithm to enhance its exploration and exploitation
capabilities. In addition to such directional echolocation, three other
improvements have been embedded into the standard bat algorithm to enhance its
performance. The new proposed approach, namely the directional Bat Algorithm
(dBA), has been then tested using several standard and non-standard benchmarks
from the CEC2005 benchmark suite. The performance of dBA has been compared with
ten other algorithms and BA variants using non-parametric statistical tests.
The statistical test results show the superiority of the directional bat
algorithm.
