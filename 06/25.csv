decision-making, where a crucial role belongs to smart video surveillance
systems. While existing deployments of stationary monitoring cameras already
deliver notable societal benefits, the proposed concept of massive video
surveillance over connected vehicles that we contribute in this paper may
further augment these important capabilities. We therefore introduce the
envisioned system concept, discuss its implementation, outline the high-level
architecture, and identify major data flows, while also offering insights into
the corresponding design and deployment aspects. Our conducted case study
confirms the potential of the described crowd sourced vehicular system to
effectively complement and eventually surpass even the best of today's static
video surveillance setups. We expect that our proposal will become of value and
integrate seamlessly into the future Internet-of-Things landscape, thus
enabling a plethora of advanced urban applications.

examined the role played by the parameter $\alpha$ that is a measure of the
coupling strength with the additional atom at the center of the honeycomb
graphene lattice and which, when varied, continuously gives a different Berry
phase. We have found that the electronic properties of the $\alpha$ -$T_3$

the polarization of the imposed irradiation. We have demonstrated that under
elliptically-polarized light the low-energy band structure of such lattice
directly depends on the valley index $\tau$. We have obtained and analyzed the
corresponding wave functions, their symmetries and the corresponding Berry
phases, and revealed that such phases could be finite even for a dice lattice,
which has not been observed in the absence of the dressing field. This results
lead to possible radiation-generated band structure engineering, as well as
experimental and technological realization of such optoelectronic devices and

thanks to much shorter timescales typically associated with the first ones. The
electronic structure of alkaline-earth atoms, on the other hand, presents
ultra-narrow transitions and metastable states that makes such an approximation
invalid in the general case. In this article, we report on a model based on
open Bloch equations for the evolution of the number of atoms in a

strontium blue magneto-optical trap under different repumping schemes, either
directly from a Zeeman slower, or from an atomic reservoir made of atoms in a
metastable state trapped in the magnetic quadrupolar field. The fluorescence
observed on the strong 461~nm transition is recorded and quantitatively
compared with the results from our simulations. The comparison between
experimental results and calculations within our model allowed to identify the
existence of the decay paths between the upper level of the repumping

explained by electric dipole transition rates calculated in the literature.
Moreover, our analysis pinpoints the role of the atomic movement in limiting

in finite volume schemes of industrial use is to correct the standard two-point
flux approximation with a term accounting for the local mesh non-orthogonality.
Practical experience with a variety of different mesh typologies, including
non-orthogonal tetrahedral, hexahedral and polyhedral meshes, has shown that
this discrete diffusion operator is accurate and robust whenever the mesh is
not too distorted and sufficiently regular. In this work, we show that this
approach can be interpreted as equivalent to introducing an anisotropic
operator that accounts for the preferential directions induced by the local
mesh non-orthogonality. This allows to derive a convergence analysis of the
corrected method under a quite weak global assumption on mesh distortion. This
convergence proof, which is obtained for the first time for this finite volume
method widely employed in industrial software packages such as OpenFOAM,
provides a reference framework on how to interpret some of its variants
commonly implemented in commercial finite volume codes. Numerical experiments
are presented that confirm the accuracy and robustness of the results.
Furthermore, we also show empirically that a least square approach to the
gradient computation can provide second order convergence even when the mild
non-orthogonality condition on the mesh is violated.

different physics approximations and hydrodynamics codes. We aim to assess the
impact of the hydrodynamics code, approximations for the neutrino and gravity

different hydrodynamics codes in this work (ELEPHANT, FLASH, fGR1, and SPHYNX)
in combination with two different neutrino treatments, the isotropic diffusion
source approximation (IDSA) and two-moment M1, and three different gravity
treatments: Newtonian, 1D General Relativity (GR) correction, and full GR).
Additional parameters discussed in this study are the inclusion of
neutrino-electron scattering via a parametrized deleptonization (PD) and the
influence of rotation. The four codes compared in this work include Eulerian
and fully Lagrangian (smoothed particle hydrodynamics) codes for the first
time. They show agreement in the overall evolution of the collapse phase and
early post-bounce within the range of 10% (20% in some cases). The comparison
of the different neutrino treatments highlights the need to further investigate
the antineutrino luminosities in IDSA, which tend to be relatively high. We
also demonstrate the requirement for a more detailed heavy-lepton neutrino
leakage. When comparing with a full GR code, including an M1 transport method,
we confirm the influence of neutrino-electron scattering during the collapse
phase, which is adequately captured by the PD scheme. Also, the effective GR
potential reproduces the overall dynamic evolution correctly in all Newtonian
codes. Additionally, we verify that rotation aids the shock expansion and
estimate the overall angular momentum losses for each code in rotating
scenarios.

pseudodistance from the origin, and those ones whose curvature depends on the
Lorentzian pseudodistance through the horizontal or vertical geodesic to a
fixed lightlike geodesic. Making use of the notions of geometric angular
momentum (with respect to the origin) and geometric linear momentum (with
respect to the fixed lightlike geodesic) respectively, we get two abstract
integrability results to determine such curves through quadratures. In this
way, we find out several new families of Lorentzian spiral, special elastic and
grim-reaper curves whose intrinsic equations are expressed in terms of
elementary functions. In addition, we provide uniqueness results for the
generatrix curve of the Enneper's surface of second kind and for Lorentzian
versions of some well known curves in the Euclidean setting, like the Bernoulli
lemniscate, the cardioid, the sinusoidal spirals and some non-degenerate
conics. We are able to get arc-length parametrizations of them and they are
depicted graphically.

  Consequences, Avenues and Algorithmic Progress",,,,,"cs.DS cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motivated by studying the power of randomness, certifying algorithms and
barriers for fine-grained reductions, we investigate the question whether the
multiplication of two $n\times n$ matrices can be performed in near-optimal
nondeterministic time $\tilde{O}(n^2)$. Since a classic algorithm due to
Freivalds verifies correctness of matrix products probabilistically in time
$O(n^2)$, our question is a relaxation of the open problem of derandomizing
Freivalds' algorithm.
  We discuss consequences of a positive or negative resolution of this problem
and provide potential avenues towards resolving it. Particularly, we show that
sufficiently fast deterministic verifiers for 3SUM or univariate polynomial
identity testing yield faster deterministic verifiers for matrix
multiplication. Furthermore, we present the partial algorithmic progress that
distinguishing whether an integer matrix product is correct or contains between
1 and $n$ erroneous entries can be performed in time $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ --
interestingly, the difficult case of deterministic matrix product verification
is not a problem of ""finding a needle in the haystack"", but rather cancellation
effects in the presence of many errors.
  Our main technical contribution is a deterministic algorithm that corrects an
integer matrix product containing at most $t$ errors in time
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{t} n^2 + t^2)$. To obtain this result, we show how to compute
an integer matrix product with at most $t$ nonzeroes in the same running time.
This improves upon known deterministic output-sensitive integer matrix
multiplication algorithms for $t = \Omega(n^{2/3})$ nonzeroes, which is of
independent interest.

The effective description of such models on the tensor branch is in terms of

resulting theories in four dimensions are expected to have N=1 supersymmetry.
We compute the anomalies expected from the resulting 4d theories by integrating
the anomaly polynomial of the 6d theory on the Riemann surface. For the cases
with 6d gauge models with gauge groups SU(3) and SO(8) we further propose a
field theory construction for the resulting 4d theories. For the 6d SU(3)
theory, we argue that the theories in four dimensions are quivers with SU(3)
gauge nodes and free chiral fields. The theories one obtains from the 6d SO(8)
gauge theory are quivers with SU(4) gauge groups and chiral fields with R
charge a half. In the last case the theories constructed for general Riemann
surfaces involve gauging of symmetries appearing at strong coupling. The
conformal manifolds of the models are constructed from gauge couplings and
baryonic superpotentials. We support our conjectures by matching the dimensions
of the conformal manifolds with complex structure moduli of the Riemann
surfaces, matching anomalies between six and four dimensions, and checking the
dualities related to different pair of pants decompositions of the surfaces. As
a simple application of the results we conjecture that SU(3) gauge theory with

large quantities of sensitive RF and microwave frequency devices distributed

synchronization by means of high frequency signal distributed along the
accelerator facility. Coaxial cables are commonly used to distribute the
reference signal over the large machine to synchronize electronic systems and
they are the main source of undesirable phase drifts in the synchronization
system. Signal phase drifts in cables are mainly caused by temperature and
humidity variations and their values usually exceed required phase
synchronization accuracy by more than order of magnitude. There are several
approaches to reduce signal phase drifts in coaxial cables. This paper
describes the realization of active phase stabilization system based on
interference phenomenon. A phase-locked signal from the transmitter is
reflected at the end of a coaxial cable link. Directional couplers placed along
the cable pick up the forward and reflected signals and interfere them to
cancel out the cable phase drifts. Distributed hardware including
interferometer controller/transmitter and receiver modules were built to
demonstrate system concept and performance. Link input and output devices used
FPGA I/O boards with Ethernet interface to control system operation.
Specialized firmware and software was developed to calibrate and control the
system. This paper describes the concept of interferometer link, designed
hardware, basic control algorithms and performance evaluation results. The link

by following three papers that have received wide acceptance from practitioners
as the theoretical foundations for it - [Piterbarg 2010], [Burgard and Kjaer

  The review reveals several conceptual and technical inconsistencies with the
approaches taken in these papers. In particular, a key component of the
approach - prescription of cost components to a risk-free money account,
generates derivative prices that are not cleared by the markets that trade the
derivative and its underlying securities. It also introduces several risk-free
positions (accounts) that accrue at persistently non-zero spreads with respect
to each other and the risk free rate. In the case of derivatives with
counterparty default risk [Burgard and Kjaer 2013] introduces an approach
referred to as semi-replication, which through the choice of cost components in
the money account results in derivative prices that carry arbitrage
opportunities in the form of holding portfolio of counterparty's bonds versus a
derivative position with it.
  This paper derives no-arbitrage expressions for default-risky derivative
contracts with and without collateral, avoiding these inconsistencies.

discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It is based on
questionnaires and interviews made shortly before and shortly after the
discovery in 2012. We show, to begin with, that the discovery of a Standard
Model (SM) Higgs boson was less expected than is sometimes assumed. Once the
new particle was shown to have properties consistent with SM expectations -
albeit with significant experimental uncertainties -, there was a broad
agreement that 'a' Higgs boson had been found. Physicists adopted a twopronged
strategy. On the one hand, they treated the particle as a SM Higgs boson and
tried to establish its properties with higher precision; on the other hand,
they searched for any hints of physics beyond the SM. This motivates our first
philosophical thesis: the Higgs discovery, being of fundamental importance and
establishing a new kind of particle, represented a crucial experiment if one
interprets this notion in an appropriate sense. By embedding the LHC into
thetradition of previous precision experiments and the experimental strategies
thus established, Duhemian underdetermination is kept at bay. Second, our case
study suggests that criteria of theory (or model) preference should be
understood as epistemic and pragmatic values that have to be weighed in factual
research practice. The Higgs discovery led to a shift from pragmatic to
epistemic values as regards the mechanisms of electroweak symmetry breaking.
Complex criteria, such as naturalness, combine epistemic and pragmatic values,
but are coherently applied by the community.

constructs a compact representation for the graph by assembling the vertex

2021, the ATLAS collaboration is planning a major detector upgrade. As a part
of this, the Level 1 trigger based on calorimeter data will be upgraded to
exploit the fine granularity readout using a new system of Feature EXtractors
(FEX), which each reconstruct different physics objects for the trigger
selection. The jet FEX (jFEX) system is conceived to provide jet identification
(including large area jets) and measurements of global variables within a
latency budget of less then 400ns. It consists of 6 modules. A single jFEX
module is an ATCA board with 4 large FPGAs of the Xilinx Ultrascale+ family,
that can digest a total input data rate of ~3.6 Tb/s using up to 120 Multi
Gigabit Transceiver (MGT), 24 electrical optical devices, board control and
power on the mezzanines to allow flexibility in upgrading controls functions
and components without affecting the main board. The 24-layers stack-up was
carefully designed to preserve the signal integrity in a very densely populated
high speed signal board selecting MEGTRON6 as the most suitable PCB material.
This contribution reports on the design challenges and the test results of the
jFEX prototypes. In particular the fully assembled final prototype has been
tested up to 12.8 Gb/s in house and in integrated tests at CERN. The full jFEX
system will be produced by the end of 2018 to allow for installation and
commissioning to be completed before LHC restarts in March 2021.

evaluate statistics of the scattered wave everywhere in the exterior domain,

external leads with different temperatures and embedded in a cavity with a
single photon mode. Thermospin transport of the ring-cavity system is
investigated by tuning the Rashba coupling constant and the electron-photon

the leads causes a generation of a thermospin transport in the ring system. It
is observed that the induced spin polarization has a maximum value at the
critical value of the Rashba coupling constant corresponding to the
Aharonov-Casher destructive interference, where the thermospin current is
efficiently suppressed. Embedded in a photon cavity with the photon energy
close to a resonance with the energy spacing between lowest states of the
quantum ring, a Rabi splitting in the energy spectrum is observed. Furthermore,
photon replica states are formed leading to a reduction in the thermospin

sustain states of low-dimensional chaos when the acoustic intensity driving the

extracted from numerical simulations: (i) We first characterise successive
bifurcations through the analysis of leading frequencies. Two successive phases
in the evolution of the system are singled out in this way, both leading to
potentially chaotic states. The two phases are separated by a drastic
simplification of the dynamics that immediately follows the emergence of
intermittency. The second phase also features a second intermediate state where
the dynamics is simplified due to frequency-locking. (ii) Nonlinear time series
analysis enables us to reconstruct the attractor of the underlying dynamical
system, and to calculate its correlation dimension and leading Lyapunov
exponent. Both these quantities bring confirmation that the state preceding the
dynamic simplification that initiates the second phase is chaotic. Poincar\'e
maps further reveal that this chaotic state in fact results from a dynamic
instability of the system between two non-chaotic states respectively observed
at slightly lower and slightly higher acoustic forcing.

of the probing light are captured to first order in perturbation theory. The
resulting equations are reminiscent to those for equilibrium absorption but
with the Floquet modes playing the role of the pristine eigenstates. The
formalism is employed to characterize the optical properties of a model

(non-perturbative, but non-ionizing). As shown, non-resonant light can
reversibly turn this transparent semiconductor into a broadband absorber and
open strong absorption/stimulated emission bands at very low frequencies (~
meV). Further, the absorption spectra of the driven material exhibit periodic
features energetically spaced by the photon energy of the driving light that
reflect the periodic structure of the Floquet bands. These developments offer a
general approach to understand and predict the emergent optical properties of

low quality experimental data. By considering in-silico and in-vitro data, we
show that the method provides a more accurate statistical classification of the

simulations of individual experiments by showing how underlying parameters
relate to degeneracies as represented on a biprobability plot. We show how a

apply this to the experimental hints that suggest $\delta_{13} \sim -\pi/2$ to
see that this could also be consistent with $\delta_{13}, \delta_{e\tau} = 0$

when there are unstated assumptions in either the physical or cyber parts of

present an automated method towards identifying unstated assumptions in CPS.
Dynamic specifications in the form of candidate invariants of both the software

Simulink/Stateflow (SLSF) model diagrams to generate traces in the input format

detect candidate invariants of several CPS case studies. We use the running
example of a DC-to-DC power converter, and demonstrate that Hynger can detect a
specification mismatch where a tolerance assumed by the software is violated

readout channels. As an enabling technology for noble liquid detectors in
neutrino experiments, cold electronics developed for extremely low temperature
(77K - 89K) decouples the electrode and cryostat design from the readout
design. With front-end electronics integrated with detector electrodes, the
noise is independent of the fiducial volume and about half as with electronics
at room temperature. Digitization and signal multiplexing to high speed serial
links inside cryostat result in large reduction in the quantity of cables (less
outgassing) and the number of feed-throughs, therefore minimize the penetration
and simplify the cryostat design. Being considered as an option for the TPC
readout, several Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) ADC chips have been identified
as good candidates for operation in cryogenic temperature after initial

of which lifetime at cryogenic temperature is studied. The lifetime study
includes two phases, the exploratory phase and the validation phase. This paper
describes the test method, test setup, observations in the exploratory phase
and the validation phase. Based on the current test data, the preliminary
lifetime projection of AD7274 is about 6.1 $\times$ $10^6$ years at 2.5V
operation at cryogenic temperature, which means the HCE degradation is
negligible during the SBND service life.

the reasons underlying their (non-)convergence behaviors are still not

example, we mathematically analyze its local convergence behavior in a
non-asymptotic way. Furthermore, the analysis is extended to general GANs under
certain assumptions. We find that in order to ensure a good convergence rate,
two factors of the Jacobian in the GAN training dynamics should be
simultaneously avoided, which are (i) the Phase Factor, i.e., the Jacobian has
complex eigenvalues with a large imaginary-to-real ratio, and (ii) the
Conditioning Factor, i.e., the Jacobian is ill-conditioned. Previous methods of
regularizing the Jacobian can only alleviate one of these two factors, while
making the other more severe. Thus we propose a new JAcobian REgularization

massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems. We firstly propose a
successive interference cancellation based hybrid precoding algorithm to
maximize the achievable rate for any given RF chain and antenna configuration.
This algorithm firstly decomposes the total achievable rate optimization
problem into multiple sub-rate optimization problems, then it successively
maximizes these sub-rates. Since the number of RF chains is limited, we can
afford using an exhaustive search scheme to evaluate all configurations and
identify the one having the best energy efficiency. Moreover, to rely on an
attractive limited feedback, we also propose a beamsteering codebook for our
hybrid precoding aided GSAC architecture. Our simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed scheme achieves a similar rate as the corresponding optimal
unconstrained precoder. Furthermore, we show that the energy-efficiency of the
proposed scheme is better than that of the existing schemes in the
fully-connected and sub-array-connected architectures.

low-level radio frequency (LLRF) control systems. The stability of beams'
parameters in linear accelerators depends on the stability of amplitude and
phase of the accelerating field. A LLRF control system regulates the
electromagnetic field inside accelerating modules based on the input RF
signals. Typically active mixers down-convert those signals, which are later
sampled and digitized by ADCs. This field detection scheme necessitates
synthesis of a heterodyne/local oscillator (LO) signal which is often generated
using a passive mixer and a frequency divider. Additive close-to-carrier phase
noise can be observed in the aforementioned circuits. The phase noise of a
passive mixer's output signal is typically calculated using a small-signal
model based on modulation theory. Experimental results indicate that the power
level of the input signals has a nonlinear effect on phase noise beyond the
noise floor. The frequency dividers' output phase noise was measured as a
function of input power, input frequency, and division ratio. The influence of
the LO signal power level on the active mixers' output signal phase noise was
measured and two hypotheses were made. Further measurements of the AM-PM and
PM-AM conversion were made to verify one of the hypotheses. The fidelity of the
LO signal is partially determined by the phase noise of the IF signal.

Neutron Source (CSNS) is to measure nuclear data. The energy of neutrons is one
of the most important parameters for measuring nuclear data. Method of time of
flight (TOF) is used to obtain the energy of neutrons. The time when proton
bunches hit the thick tungsten target is considered as the start point of TOF.
T0 signal, generated from the CSNS accelerator, represents this start time.
Besides, the T0 signal is also used as the gate control signal that triggers
the readout electronics. Obviously, the timing precision of T0 directly affects
the measurement precision of TOF and controls the running or readout
electronics. In this paper, the T0 fan-out for Back-n white neutron facility at
CSNS is proposed. The T0 signal travelling from the CSNS accelerator is fanned
out to the two underground experiment stations respectively over long cables.
To guarantee the timing precision, T0 signal is conditioned with good signal
edge. Furthermore, techniques of signal pre-emphasizing and equalizing are used
to improve signal quality after T0 being transmitted over long cables with
about 100 m length. Experiments show that the T0 fan-out works well, the T0
signal transmitted over 100 m remains a good time resolution with a standard
deviation of 25 ps. It absolutely meets the required accuracy of the

implement the electronics of TOF measurement on the general-purpose readout

is based on PXIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express eXtensions for

TCM (Trigger and Clock Module), and SCM (Signal Conditioning Module). T0 signal
synchronous to the CSNS accelerator represents the neutron emission from the
target. It is the start of time stamp. The trigger and clock module (TCM)
receives, synchronizes and distributes the T0 signal to each FDM based on the
PXIe backplane bus. Meantime, detector signals after being conditioned are fed
into FDMs for waveform digitizing. First sample point of the signal is the stop
of time stamp. According to the start, stop time stamp and the time of signal
over threshold, the total TOF can be obtained. FPGA-based (Field Programmable
Gate Array) TDC is implemented on TCM to accurately acquire the time interval
between the asynchronous T0 signal and the global synchronous clock phase.
There is also an FPGA-based TDC on FDM to accurately acquire the time interval
between T0 arriving at FDM and the first sample point of the detector signal,
the over threshold time of signal is obtained offline. This method for TOF

stay on schedule and/or to maintain regular headways. In current practice,
transit agencies add significant slack to the schedule and hold buses until
their scheduled departure time at certain stations along the route. These
practices can smooth out small disruptions but are not robust to large
disruptions. Various headway-based strategies have been proposed but these also
rely on holding buses and therefore reduce their average pace. Transit signal
priority (TSP) is commonly used to reduce the signal delay that buses
experience but the potential for signals to serve as an additional control
agent to enhance bus reliability has not been systematically evaluated. We are
especially interested in evaluating conditional signal priority (CSP), in which
buses send priority requests only when a condition is met. A mathematical model
based on Brownian motion is proposed for bus systems with a schedule where
pairing is not a concern and is used to develop formulas for the expectation
and variance of steady state deviation. Simulation is used to confirm these
findings and to evaluate the case of bus systems operated by headway where
pairing is a concern. The analytical and simulation results show that CSP can
be used not just to accelerate buses but to improve their reliability. CSP is
as good as TSP in some scenarios and better in others. In all scenarios it is
better for other traffic because it sends fewer priority requests.

enterprises. However, given the locality constraint of edges (i.e., only
close-by edges are useful), multiplexing diverse workloads becomes challenging.
This results in poor resource utilization in edge resources that are
provisioned for peak demand. A simple way to allow multiplexing is through
micro-data centers, that bring computation close to the users while supporting
diverse workloads throughout the data, along with edges. In this paper, we
argue for a hybrid approach of dedicated edge resources within an enterprise
and on demand resources in micro-data centers that are shared across entities.
We show that this hybrid approach is an effective and cost-efficient way for
scaling workloads and removes the need for over-provisioning dedicated
resources per enterprise. Moreover, compared to a scaling approach that uses
only the edges across enterprises, micro-data centers also form a trusted third
party that can maintain important quality of service guarantees such as data
privacy, security, and availability.

at the critical temperature in macroscopic systems. A variety of many-body
systems can be represented in momentum space as a spin-1/2 state evolving on
the Bloch sphere, where each momentum mode is decoupled and thus can be
simulated independently by a single qubit. Here, we report the observation of a
dynamical quantum phase transition in a superconducting qubit simulation of the
quantum quench dynamics of many-body systems. We take the Ising model with a
transverse field as an example for demonstration. In our experiment, the spin
state, which is initially polarized longitudinally, evolves based on a
Hamiltonian with adjustable parameters depending on the momentum and strength
of the transverse magnetic field. The time evolving quantum state is read out
by state tomography. Evidence of dynamical quantum phase transitions, such as
paths of time evolution states on the Bloch sphere, non-analytic behavior of
the dynamical free energy and the emergence of Skyrmion lattice in
momentum-time space, is observed. The experimental data agrees well with
theoretical and numerical calculations. The experiment demonstrates for the
first time explicitly the topological invariant, both topologically trivial and
non-trivial, for dynamical quantum phase transitions. Our results show that the

layers mostly lies in the covalent-like quasi-bonding that is significant in
electronic structures but rather weak for energetics. Such characteristics
result in various stacking orders that are energetically comparable but may
significantly differ in terms of electronic structures, e.g. magnetism.
Inspired by several recent experiments showing interlayer
anti-ferromagnetically coupled CrI3 bilayers, we carried out first-principles
calculations for CrI3 bilayers. We found that the anti-ferromagnetic coupling
results from a new stacking order with the C2/m space group symmetry, rather
than the graphene-like one with R3 as previously believed. Moreover, we
demonstrated that the intra- and inter-layer couplings in CrI3 bilayer are
governed by two different mechanisms, namely ferromagnetic super-exchange and
direct-exchange interactions, which are largely decoupled because of their
significant difference in strength at the strong- and weak-interaction limits.
This allows the much weaker interlayer magnetic coupling to be more feasibly
tuned by stacking orders solely. Given the fact that interlayer magnetic
properties can be altered by changing crystal structure with different stacking
orders, our work opens a new paradigm for tuning interlayer magnetic properties
with the freedom of stacking order in two dimensional layered materials.

the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings (FWH) method within I/O analysis framework to
measure far-field sound of observers distributed along an arc. In this way we
find that the resulting TKE-weighted input modes captures coherent structures

wavepackets represented by asymmetric pseudo-Gaussian envelope functions at a
given forcing frequency. These wavepackets remain similar in shape over a range

is a wavepacket, sub-optimal modes represent decoherence of the optimal input

and maker, it is hard to distinguish them based on their global appearances.
Compared with the global appearance, local regions such as decorations and
inspection stickers attached to the windshield, may be more distinctive for
vehicle Re-ID. To embed the detailed visual cues in those local regions, we
propose a Region-Aware deep Model (RAM). Specifically, in addition to
extracting global features, RAM also extracts features from a series of local
regions. As each local region conveys more distinctive visual cues, RAM
encourages the deep model to learn discriminative features. We also introduce a
novel learning algorithm to jointly use vehicle IDs, types/models, and colors
to train the RAM. This strategy fuses more cues for training and results in
more discriminative global and regional features. We evaluate our methods on
two large-scale vehicle Re-ID datasets, i.e., VeRi and VehicleID. Experimental
results show our methods achieve promising performance in comparison with
recent works.

characteristic features of a three-dimensional terahertz (THz) photonic crystal
with a silicon inverse diamond structure whose lattice point shape was vacant
regular octahedrons, did not apply to general physical and optical basic rules
in appearance. One of the basic rules is that, according to Maxwell's
equations, the electric-field direction of the reflected wave rotates by 180
degrees from that of the incident wave in the case of complete reflection
(Bragg reflection) and normal incidence. It is said that three-dimensional
photonic crystals have no polarization anisotropy within photonic band gap
(stop gap, stop band) of high symmetry points in normal incidence. Experimental
results, however, confirmed that the polarization orientation of a reflected
wave was rotated by 90 degrees for that of an incident wave at a frequency
within photonic band gap. In this work, measured reflected spectra [1] were
semi-quantitatively evaluated by being compared with reflection ones by using a
FEM (finite element method). These results suggest that measured polarization
anisotropy does not apply to Maxwell's equations in appearance but applies to
these equations in essential as expected.

a massless scalar field minimally coupled to homogeneous and isotropic gravity
has an in-built $\SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ symmetry. Protecting this symmetry
naturally provides an efficient way to constrain the quantization of this
cosmological system whatever the quantization scheme and allows in particular
to fix the quantization ambiguities arising in the canonical quantization
program. Applying this method to the loop quantization of the FLRW cosmology
leads to a new loop quantum cosmology model which preserves the
$\SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ symmetry of the classical system. This new polymer
regularization consistent with the conformal symmetry can be derived as a
non-linear canonical transformation of the classical FLRW phase space, which
maps the classical singular dynamics into a regular effective bouncing
dynamics. This improved regularization preserves the scaling properties of the
volume and Hamiltonian constraint. 3d scale transformations, generated by the
dilatation operator, are realized as unitary transformations despite the
minimal length scale hardcoded in the theory. Finally, we point out that the
resulting cosmological dynamics exhibits an interesting duality between short
and long distances, reminiscent of the T-duality in string theory, with the
near-singularity regime dual to the semi-classical regime at large volume. The
technical details of the construction of this model are presented in a longer

quark matter without a phase transition, based on the matching of the symmetry
and excitations in both phases. In the limit of a light strange-quark mass, it
connects hyperon matter and the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase exhibiting
color superconductivity. Recently, it was proposed that this conjecture could
be generalized in the presence of superfluid vortices penetrating both phases
(arXiv:1803.05115 [hep-ph]), and it was suggested that one hadronic superfluid
vortex in hyperon matter could be connected to one non-Abelian vortex (color
magnetic flux tube) in the CFL phase. Here, we argue that their proposal is
consistent only at large distances; instead, we show that three hadronic
superfluid vortices must combine with three non-Abelian vortices with different
colors with the total color magnetic fluxes canceled out, where the junction is
called a colorful boojum. We rigorously prove this in both a macroscopic theory
based on the Ginzburg-Landau description in which symmetry and excitations
match (including vortex cores), and a microscopic theory in which the
Aharonov-Bohm phases of quarks around vortices match.

is shown that the choice of chemical representation, such as SMILES strings,
has a large influence on the properties of the latent space. It is further
explored to what extent translating between different chemical representations
influences the latent space similarity to the SMILES strings or circular

based on recurrent neural networks(RNNs) with long short-term memory cells
(LSTM) to predict different enumerated SMILES strings from the same canonical

molecular similarity measured as circular fingerprints similarity. Using the
output from the bottleneck in QSAR modelling of five molecular datasets shows
that heteroencoder derived vectors markedly outperforms autoencoder derived
vectors as well as models built using ECFP4 fingerprints, underlining the
increased chemical relevance of the latent space. However, the use of
enumeration during training of the decoder leads to a markedly increase in the
rate of decoding to a different molecules than encoded, a tendency that can be
counteracted with more complex network architectures.

semiparametric in the sense that they are valid, i.e., have the correct

specified reference density, our test is point-optimal and nearly efficient.
For arbitrary reference densities, we establish a Chernoff-Savage type result,
i.e., our test performs as well as commonly used tests under Gaussian
innovations but has improved power under other, e.g., fat-tailed or skewed,
innovation distributions. To avoid nonparametric estimation, we propose a
simplified version of our test that exhibits the same asymptotic properties,

two-dimensional wave equations, semi-discretized in space by finite difference
schemes. We focus on high-frequency solutions whose propagation can be
described, both at the continuous and semi-discrete level, by micro-local
tools. We do it both for uniform and non-uniform numerical grids and also for
constant coefficients and variable ones. The energy of continuous and
semi-discrete high-frequency solutions propagates along bi-characteristic rays,
but their dynamics differ from the continuous to the semi-discrete setting,
because of the different nature of the corresponding Hamiltonians. One of the
main objectives of this paper is to illustrate through accurate numerical
simulations that, in agreement with the micro-local theory, numerical
high-frequency solutions can bend in an unexpected manner, as a result of the
accumulation of the local effects introduced by the heterogeneity of the
numerical grid. These effects are enhanced in the multi-dimensional case where
the interaction and combination of such behaviors in the various space
directions may produce, for instance, the ""rodeo effect"", i. e. waves that are
trapped by the numerical grid in closed loops, without ever getting to the
exterior boundary. Our analysis allows explaining all such pathological
behaviors. Moreover, the discussion in this paper also contributes to the
existing theory about the necessity of filtering high-frequency numerical
components when dealing with control and inversion problems for waves, which is
based very much in the theory of rays and, in particular, on the fact that they
can be observed when reaching the exterior boundary of the domain, a key
property that can be lost through numerical discretization.

loop, that is within the phase space of neural activity, body, and
environmental variables. Fixpoints, limit cycles, and chaotic attractors
correspond in this setting to a non-moving robot, to directed, and to irregular
locomotion respectively. Short higher-order control commands may hence be used
to kick the system from one self-organized attractor robustly into the basin of
attraction of a different attractor, a concept termed here as kick control. The
individual sensorimotor states serve in this context as highly compliant motor
primitives.
  We study different implementations of kick control for the case of simulated
and real-world wheeled robots, for which the dynamics of the distinct wheels is
generated independently by local feedback loops. The feedback loops are
mediated by rate-encoding neurons disposing exclusively of propriosensoric
inputs in terms of projections of the actual rotational angle of the wheel. The
changes of the neural activity are then transmitted into a rotational motion by
a simulated transmission rod akin to the transmission rods used for steam
locomotives.
  We find that the self-organized attractor landscape may be morphed both by
higher-level control signals, in the spirit of kick control, and by interacting
with the environment. Bumping against a wall destroys the limit cycle
corresponding to forward motion, with the consequence that the dynamical
variables are then attracted in phase space by the limit cycle corresponding to
backward moving. The robot, which does not dispose of any distance or contact
sensors, hence reverses direction autonomously.

absence of intra-orbital next-nearest neighbor hopping, perfect nesting between
electron-type and hole-type Fermi surfaces at the the center and at the corner

in the presence of magnetic frustration within mean field theory. An

the Fermi surfaces undergo a Lifshitz transition to electron/hole Fermi surface

of electron-hole (e-h) pairs in van der Waals bound low-dimensional systems is
driven by layer stacking. Four types of excitons appear, with either a two- or
three-dimensional spatial extension. Electron and hole distributions are either
overlapping or exhibit a charge-transfer nature. We discuss under which
structural and symmetry conditions they appear and they are either dark or
bright. This analysis provides the key elements to identify, predict, and
possibly tailor the character of e-h pairs in van der Waals materials.

the main downside of traditional Hill Climbing (HC) search, which is often
quickly trapped in a local optimum due to strictly accepting only non-worsening
moves within each iteration. In contrast, LAHC also accepts worsening moves, by
keeping a circular array of fitness values of previously visited solutions and
comparing the fitness values of candidate solutions against the least recent
element in the array. While this straightforward strategy has proven effective,
there are nevertheless situations where LAHC can unfortunately behave in a
similar manner to HC. For example, when a new local optimum is found, often the
same fitness value is stored many times in the array. To address this
shortcoming, we propose new acceptance and replacement strategies to take into
account worsening, improving, and sideways movement scenarios with the aim to
improve the diversity of values in the array. Compared to LAHC, the proposed
Diversified Late Acceptance Search approach is shown to lead to better quality
solutions that are obtained with a lower number of iterations on benchmark
Travelling Salesman Problems and Quadratic Assignment Problems.

Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software.
  The term ""Rigorous System Design"" (RSD) denotes the design approach that is
based on a formal, accountable and iterative process for deriving trustworthy
and optimised implementations from models of application software, its
execution platform and its external environment. Ideally, a system
implementation is derived from a set of appropriate high-level models by
applying a sequence of semantics-preserving transformations.
  The ambition of MeTRiD is to promote the use of formal methods, in general,
and the RSD approach, in particular, in the industrial applications and,
reciprocally, bring the attention of the formal methods researchers to such
industrial applications in order to develop realistic case-studies and guide
the evolution of tools. Striving towards this ambitious goal, we have solicited
contributions of three types:
  - regular papers, presenting original research
  - case study papers, reporting the evaluation of existing modelling,
analysis, transformation and code generation formalisms and tools on realistic
examples of significant size
  - tool papers, describing new tool prototypes supporting the RSD flow and
enhancements of existing ones
  We have received 13 submissions (7 regular, 4 tool and 2 case study papers),
whereof 8 have been accepted for presentation at the workshop:
  - 5 regular papers
  - 2 tool papers
  - 1 case study paper

hallmarks of black holes and are known to play a central role in a variety of
phenomena related to these extreme objects. The very existence of such orbits
when motion is not confined in the equatorial plane, i.e. spherical orbits, is
indeed a special property of the separable Kerr metric and may not occur, for
instance, in the spacetime of other more speculative ultracompact objects. In
this paper we consider a general stationary-axisymmetric spacetime and examine
under what circumstances spherical or more general, variable-radius,
`spheroidal' non-equatorial photon orbits may exist with the ultimate goal of
using the modifications -- or even loss -- of photon trapping orbits as a
telltale of non-Kerr physics. In addressing this issue, we first derive a
general necessary condition for the existence of spherical/spheroidal orbits
and then go on to study photon trapping orbits in a variety of known non-Kerr
metrics (Johannsen, Johanssen-Psaltis, and Hartle-Thorne). The first of these
is an example of a separable spacetime which supports Kerr-like spherical
photon orbits. A more detailed analysis reveals a deeper connection between the
presence of spherical orbits and the separability of a metric (that is, the
existence of a third integral of motion). Specifically, a spacetime that does
not admit spherical orbits in any coordinates is necessarily non-separable. The
other two spacetimes considered here exhibit a clear non-Kerr behaviour by
having spherical photon orbits replaced by spheroidal ones. More importantly,
subject to the degree of deviation from Kerr, equatorial photon rings give
place to non-equatorial ones with an accompanying loss of low-inclination
spheroidal orbits. The implications of these results for the electromagnetic
and gravitational wave signature of non-Kerr objects are briefly discussed.

The recognition accuracy and its processing time depend on task properties such
as viewing condition, level of noise and etc. Recognition accuracy can be well
explained by different models. However, less attention has been paid to the
processing time and the ones that do, are not biologically plausible. By
extracting features temporally as well as utilizing an accumulation to bound
decision making model, an object recognition model accounting for both
recognition time and accuracy is proposed. To temporally extract informative
features in support of possible classes of stimuli, a hierarchical spiking
neural network, called spiking HMAX is modified. In the decision making part of
the model the extracted information accumulates over time using accumulator
units. The input category is determined as soon as any of the accumulators
reaches a threshold, called decision bound. Results show that not only does the
model follow human accuracy in a psychophysics task better than the classic
spiking HMAX model, but also it predicts human response time in each choice.
Results provide enough evidence that temporal representation of features are
informative since they can improve the accuracy of a biological plausible
decision maker over time. This is also in line with the well-known idea of
speed accuracy trade-off in decision making studies.

involve many vulnerabilities and hosts, compromise the security of many
well-protected businesses. This has led to the solutions that ubiquitously
monitor system activities in each host (big data) as a series of events, and
search for anomalies (abnormal behaviors) for triaging risky events. Since
fighting against these attacks is a time-critical mission to prevent further
damage, these solutions face challenges in incorporating expert knowledge to
perform timely anomaly detection over the large-scale provenance data.
  To address these challenges, we propose a novel stream-based query system
that takes as input, a real-time event feed aggregated from multiple hosts in
an enterprise, and provides an anomaly query engine that queries the event feed
to identify abnormal behaviors based on the specified anomalies. To facilitate
the task of expressing anomalies based on expert knowledge, our system provides
a domain-specific query language, SAQL, which allows analysts to express models
for (1) rule-based anomalies, (2) time-series anomalies, (3) invariant-based
anomalies, and (4) outlier-based anomalies. We deployed our system in NEC Labs
America comprising 150 hosts and evaluated it using 1.1TB of real system
monitoring data (containing 3.3 billion events). Our evaluations on a broad set
of attack behaviors and micro-benchmarks show that our system has a low
detection latency (<2s) and a high system throughput (110,000 events/s;
supporting ~4000 hosts), and is more efficient in memory utilization than the
existing stream-based complex event processing systems.

for active background rejection. In addition, twin detectors will be located in
the northern and southern hemispheres to identify possible contributions to the
modulation from seasonal or site-related effects. The SABRE project includes an
initial Proof-of-Principle phase at LNGS (Italy), to assess the radio-purity of
the crystals and the efficiency of the liquid scintillator veto. This paper
describes the general concept of SABRE and the expected sensitivity to WIMP

multiscale models is introduced. The methods are semi-intrusive in the sense
that inspection of the model is limited up to the level of the single scale
systems, and viewing these single scale components as black-boxes. The goal is
to estimate uncertainty in the result of multiscale models at a reduced amount
of time as compared to black-box Monte Carlo (MC). In the resulting
semi-intrusive MC method, the required number of samples of an expensive single
scale model is minimized in order to reduce the execution time for the overall
UP. In the metamodeling approach, the expensive model component is replaced
completely by a computationally much cheaper surrogate model. These
semi-intrusive algorithms have been tested on two case studies based on
reaction-diffusion dynamics. The results demonstrate that the proposed
semi-intrusive methods can result in a significant reduction of the
computational time for multiscale UP, while still computing accurately the
estimates of uncertainties. The semi-intrusive methods can, therefore, be a
valid alternative, when uncertainties of a multiscale model cannot be estimated
by the black-box MC methods in a feasible amount of time.

(2) maximize the expected return and (3) keep the system in state-space regions

dark/antidark soliton solution with the help of DT method. Unlike the bright
soliton case, dark/antidark soliton solution exhibits stable structure for the
field and the parity transformed conjugate field separately. In the
dark/antidark soliton solution case we observe a contrasting behaviour between
the envelope of the field and parity transformed complex conjugate envelope of
the field. For a particular parametric choice, we get dark (antidark) soliton
for the field while the parity transformed complex conjugate field exhibits
antidark (dark) soliton. Due to this surprising result, both the field and PT
transformed complex conjugate field exhibit sixteen different combinations of
collision scenario. We classify the parametric regions of dark and antidark
solitons in both the field and parity transformed complex conjugate field by
carrying out relevant asymptotic analysis. Further we present
$2N$-dark/antidark soliton solution formula and demonstrate that this solution
may have $2^{2N}\times 2^{2N}$ combinations of collisions.

individuals cannot experience the event of interest. Mixture cure models
consider the target population as a mixture of susceptible and non-susceptible
individuals. The statistical analysis of these models focuses on examining the
probability of cure (incidence model) and inferring on the time-to-event in the
susceptible subpopulation (latency model).
  Bayesian inference on mixture cure models has typically relied upon Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The integrated nested Laplace approximation
(INLA) is a recent and attractive approach for doing Bayesian inference. INLA
in its natural definition cannot fit mixture models but recent research has new
proposals that combine INLA and MCMC methods to extend its applicability to
them (Bivand et al., 2014, G\'omez-Rubio et al., 2017, G\'omez-Rubio and Rue,
2018}.
  This paper focuses on the implementation of INLA in mixture cure models. A
general mixture cure survival model with covariate information for the latency
and the incidence model within a general scenario with censored and
non-censored information is discussed. The fact that non-censored individuals
undoubtedly belong to the uncured population is a valuable information that was
incorporated in the inferential process.

investigated in manifestly relativistic baryon chiral perturbation theory with
explicit inclusion of the $\Delta$(1232) resonance. Most of the involved
low-energy constants have been previously determined in other processes such as
pion-nucleon elastic scattering and electromagnetic pion production off the

lead to sizeable contributions in all channels, especially in $\nu_\mu p\to

non-potential energy stored in coronal magnetic fields is rapidly released

outflow, and signatures of accelerated particles have been put forward as
evidence of reconnection. We explore the origin of a persistent Type I radio
source that accompanies a coronal X--shaped structure during its passage across
the disk. Of particular interest is the time range around a partial collapse of
the structure that is associated with inflow, outflow, and signatures of
particle acceleration. Imaging radio observations from the NRH were used to
localise the radio source. SDO AIA EUV observations from the same time period
were analysed, looking for evidence of inflows and outflows. Further
\texttt{mpole} magnetic reconstructions using SDO HMI observations allowed the
magnetic connectivity associated with the radio source to be determined. The
Type I radio source was well aligned with a magnetic separator identified in
the extrapolations. During the partial collapse, gradual (1 km/s) and fast (5
km/s) inflow phases and fast (30 km/s) and rapid (80-100 km/s) outflow phases
were observed, resulting in an estimated reconnection rate of ~ 0.06. The radio
source brightening and dimming was found to be co-temporal with increased soft
x-ray emission in both RHESSI and GOES. We interpret the brightening and
dimming of the radio emission as evidence for accelerated electrons in the
reconnection region responding to a gradual fall and rapid rise in electric
drift velocity, in response to the inflowing and outflowing field lines. These
results present a comprehensive example of 3D null-point reconnection.

which includes rotational inertia (so-called 'Rayleigh beams'), is analyzed
both with a Floquet-Bloch exact formulation for free oscillations and with a
numerical treatment (developed with PML absorbing boundary conditions) for
forced vibrations (including Fourier representation and energy flux
evaluations), induced by a concentrated force or moment. A complex interplay is
observed between axial and flexural vibrations (not found in the common
idealization of out-of-plane motion), giving rise to several forms of vibration
localization: 'X-', 'cross-' and 'star-' shaped, and channel propagation. These
localizations are triggered by several factors, including rotational inertia
and slenderness of the beams and the type of forcing source (concentrated force
or moment). Although the considered grid of beams introduces an orthotropy in
the mechanical response, a surprising 'isotropization' of the vibration is
observed at special frequencies. Moreover, rotational inertia is shown to
'sharpen' degeneracies related to Dirac cones (which become more pronounced
when the aspect ratio of the grid is increased), while the slenderness can be
tuned to achieve a perfectly flat band in the dispersion diagram. The obtained
results can be exploited in the realization of metamaterials designed to
control wave propagation.

networks have recently attracted a considerable amount of research attention.
Most of the existing work on this topic however focuses on Rayleigh fading
channels which represents outdoor environments. Unlike these studies, in this
paper we analyze the performance of wireless power transfer in two-hop
decode-and-forward (DF) cooperative relaying systems in indoor channels
characterized by log-normal fading. Three well-known energy-harvesting
protocols are considered in our evaluations: a) time-switching relaying (TSR),
b) power-splitting relaying (PSR) and c) ideal relaying receiver (IRR). The
performance is evaluated in terms of the ergodic outage probability for which
we derive accurate analytical expressions for the three systems under
consideration. Results reveal that careful selection of the energy-harvesting
time and power-splitting factors in the TSR- and PSR-based system are important
to optimize performance. It is also presented that the optimized PSR system has
near-ideal performance and that increasing the source transmit power and/or the
energy-harvester efficiency can further improve performance.

device-to-device (D2D) cooperation is identified as a major mechanism to enable
5G networks to effectively and efficiently augment network resources. The
effectiveness of D2D cooperation depends on a wide range of decision making
processes that include cluster formation, resource allocation, in addition to
connection and mobility management. Irrespective of the D2D cooperation
scenario whether in sensor, ad hoc, or cellular networks, the literature
normally assumes that devices selected as relays or data sources are reliable;
this means that they will maintain the connection till the communication
session ends. Yet, this assumption is challenged in practice since devices'
batteries can be depleted (e.g., sensors in an IoT network) and devices can
move leading to connection termination (e.g., mobile users in a WiFi network or
cars in a vehicular ad hoc network). To this end, we address the problem of
reliable D2D cooperation in wireless networks by proposing a novel approach
that is proactive by utilizing reliability metrics in the decision making
process, and scalable by having low implementation complexity suitable for
dense networks. These differentiating factors are shown to enhance the overall
network reliability compared to standard techniques and to facilitate dynamic
operation which is essential for practical implementation. Performance is
evaluated using extensive simulations in addition to test bed experimental
demonstration in order to quantify gains and extract insights on a range of

To appear in ITCS'20",,,,"cs.CC cs.DS cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Resolution over linear equations is a natural extension of the popular
resolution refutation system, augmented with the ability to carry out basic
counting. Denoted Res(lin_R), this refutation system operates with disjunctions
of linear equations with boolean variables over a ring R, to refute
unsatisfiable sets of such disjunctions. Beginning in the work of [RT08],
through the work of [IS14] which focused on tree-like lower bounds, this
refutation system was shown to be fairly strong. Subsequent work (cf.[Kra17,
IS14, KO18, GK18]) made it evident that establishing lower bounds against
general Res(lin_R) refutations is a challenging and interesting task since the
system captures a 'minimal' extension of resolution with counting gates for
which no super-polynomial lower bounds are known to date.
  We provide the first super-polynomial size lower bounds on general (dag-like)
resolution over linear equations refutations in the large characteristic
regime. In particular we prove that the subset-sum principle 1+x1+...+2^n xn=0
requires refutations of exponential size over Q. Our proof technique is
nontrivial and novel: roughly speaking, we show that under certain conditions
every refutation of a subset-sum instance f=0 must pass through a fat clause
containing an equation f=alpha for each alpha in the image of f under boolean
assignments. We develop a somewhat different approach to prove exponential
lower bounds against tree-like refutations of any subset-sum instance that
depends on n variables, hence also separating tree-like from dag-like
refutations over the rationals. (Abstract continued in the full paper.)

interstitial growth and active cell motion. Via a linearisation of the
underlying multiphase model (whose nonlinearity poses significant challenge for
such analyses), we obtain, by means of multiple-scales homogenisation, a
simplified macroscale model that nevertheless retains explicit dependence on
both the microscale scaffold structure and the tissue dynamics. The model we

permeability tensors to parameterise the macroscale description. In Holden

significant computational challenges; here, we obtain a decoupled system
whereby the quasi-steady cell-problems may be solved separately from the

formulation is influenced by a set of alternative microscale boundary

thickness, the local communication between the Lagrangian points on the solid

implicit direct forcing (IDF) approach and a partition-of-unity condition for
the regularized delta function. This strategy yields a simple, yet much better
imposition of the no-slip and no-penetration boundary conditions than the
conventional direct forcing (DF) technique. In particular, the present BTDF
method can achieve a numerical accuracy comparable with other representative
improved methods, such as multi-direct forcing (MDF), implicit velocity
correction (IVC) and the reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM), while its
computation cost remains much lower and nearly equivalent to the conventional
DF scheme. The dependence of the optimum thickness value of boundary thickening
on the form of the regularized delta functions is also revealed. By coupling
the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) with BTDF-IB, the robustness of the present
BTDF IB method is demonstrated using numerical simulations of creeping flow

global galaxy properties is under debate. We use two hydrodynamical,
cosmological simulations to predict possible trends for two self-consistent
variable IMF prescriptions that respectively become locally bottom-heavy or
top-heavy in high-pressure environments. Both simulations have been calibrated
to reproduce the observed correlation between central stellar velocity
dispersion and the excess mass-to-light ratio (MLE) relative to a Salpeter IMF
by increasing the mass fraction of, respectively, dwarf stars or stellar
remnants. We find trends of MLE with galaxy age, metallicity and [Mg/Fe] that
agree qualitatively with observations. Predictions for correlations with
luminosity, half-light radius, and black hole mass are presented. The
significance of many of these correlations depends sensitively on galaxy
selection criteria such as age, luminosity, and morphology. For an IMF with a
varying high-mass end, some of these correlations are stronger than the
correlation with the birth ISM pressure (the property that governs the form of
the IMF), because in this case the MLE has a strong age dependence. Galaxies
with large MLE tend to have overmassive central black holes. This indicates
that the abnormally high MLE observed in the centres of some high-mass galaxies
does not imply that overmassive BHs are merely the result of incorrect IMF
assumptions, nor that excess M/L ratios are solely the result of overmassive
BHs. Satellite galaxies tend to scatter toward high MLE due to tidal stripping,
which may have significant implications for the inferred stellar masses of
ultracompact dwarf galaxies.

$^{11}$Li, it is expected that the latter system, which is weakly bound by
pairing effects (spatially extended single Cooper pair and odd proton acting as
spectator), constitutes an attractive laboratory to study the properties of
soft $E1$--modes and thus of isospin nuclear deformation. From the calculation
of the full dipole response function in QRPA, discretizing the continuum in a
spherical box of radius of 40 fm, one finds a GDR with centroid $E_x \approx
24$ MeV, width $\Gamma \approx$ 11 MeV and carrying 90\% of the EWSR, and a
low--lying collective resonance characterized by $E_X = 0.75$ MeV, $\Gamma =
0.5$ MeV and $6.2\%$ EWSR The wave function of the latter resonance is built
out of about fifteen components (both protons and neutrons), typical of a
collective mode. The transition densities indicate this soft $E1$--mode to be
generated by surface density oscillation of the neutron skin ($\Delta r_{np}
\approx 1.71$ fm) relative to an approximately isospin--saturated core. Through
a detailed study of the full dipole response of $^{11}$Li we will draw a

x-ray diffraction experiments from 300 K up to the melting temperature. The
pressure at which the axial ratio reaches the square root of 3 value, around 10

observed that single crystals of Zn, formed at high temperature, break into

could be caused by an isomorphic second-order phase transition induced by

screening of the spatial gradients of the scalar field, i.e. the screening of
the fifth force, happens inside a dynamically generated screening radius. This
radius is smaller than the location where the quasistatic approximation, i.e.
where the spatial gradients exceed the time derivative, holds. Even though this
quasistatic radius is much smaller than the size of the matter overdensity,
spatial gradients remain well described by the quasistatic approximation up to
the horizon. Cosmologically we find that the time derivatives can remain
dominant at redshifts $z\gtrsim 2$, when the cosmic web shows a faster growth.
Despite the existence of K-mouflage screening, we confirm that the values of
the scalar field itself are still dominated by the cosmological background,
down to the center of the matter overdensity, and that for instance the time
drift of Newton's constant due to the large-scale cosmological evolution highly
constrains K-mouflage models.

has been used to severely constrain models of dark energy that typically
predict a modification of the speed of gravitational waves. We point out that
the energy scales observed at LIGO, and the particular frequency of the neutron
star event, lie very close to the strong coupling scale or cutoff associated
with many dark energy models. While it is true that at very low energies one
expects gravitational waves to travel at a speed different than light in these
models, the same is no longer necessarily true as one reaches energy scales
close to the cutoff. We show explicitly how this occurs in a simple model with
a known partial UV completion. Within the context of Horndeski, we show how the
operators that naturally lie at the cutoff scale can affect the speed of
propagation of gravitational waves and bring it back to unity at those scales.
We discuss how further missions including LISA and PTAs could play an essential
role in testing such models.

topological phases of matter obeying an extended topological bulk-boundary

does not exhibit gapless one-dimensional (1D) topological edge states, like a
standard 2D TI, but instead has topologically-protected zero-dimensional (0D)
corner states. So far, higher-order TIs have been demonstrated only in
classical mechanical and electromagnetic metamaterials exhibiting quantized
quadrupole polarization. Here, we experimentally realize a second-order TI in
an acoustic metamaterial. This is the first experimental realization of a new
type of higher-order TI, based on a breathing Kagome lattice, that has zero
quadrupole polarization but nontrivial bulk topology characterized by quantized
Wannier centers (WCs). Unlike previous higher-order TI realizations, the corner
states depend not only on the bulk topology but also on the corner shape; we
show experimentally that they exist at acute-angled corners of the Kagome
lattice, but not at obtuse-angled corners. This shape dependence allows corner
states to act as topologically-protected but reconfigurable local resonances.

such as books composed by words or genomes composed by genes. In these
component systems, Zipf's law describes the empirical power law distribution of
component frequencies. Stochastic processes based on a sample-space-reducing
(SSR) mechanism, in which the number of accessible states reduces as the system
evolves, have been recently proposed as a simple explanation for the ubiquitous
emergence of this law. However, many complex component systems are
characterized by other statistical patterns beyond Zipf's law, such as a
sublinear growth of the component vocabulary with the system size, known as
Heap's law, and a specific statistics of shared components. This work shows,
with analytical calculations and simulations, that these statistical properties
can emerge jointly from a SSR mechanism, thus making it an appropriate
parameter-poor representation for component systems. Several alternative (and
equally simple) models, for example based on the preferential attachment
mechanism, can also reproduce Heaps' and Zipf's laws, suggesting that
additional statistical properties should be taken into account to select the
most-likely generative process for a specific system. Along this line, we will
show that the temporal component distribution predicted by the SSR model is
markedly different from the one emerging from the popular rich-gets-richer
mechanism. A comparison with empirical data from natural language indicates
that the SSR process can be chosen as a better candidate model for text
generation based on this statistical property. Finally, a limitation of the SSR
model in reproducing the empirical ""burstiness"" of word appearances in texts
will be pointed out, thus indicating a possible direction for extensions of the
basic SSR process.

dynamics of a heated Janus particle which exhibits self-propulsion. The
asymmetry in the microscopic interaction of the colloid with the solvent is
implemented by choosing different wetting parameters for the two halves of the
sphere. Consequently a gradient in temperature is created across the poles of
the sphere due to different interfacial resistance across the solid-fluid
boundary in the two hemispheres. It is this self-created temperature gradient
which leads to a self-propulsion along the direction of the symmetry axis. In
this article, we look at the orientational dynamics of such a system, as well
as the subsequent enhancement of the translational diffusivity at late times.
The orientational correlation of the symmetry axis is measured from the
simulation and provides a direct access to the rotational diffusion constant.
The heating leads to an increase in the rotational diffusivity of the colloid.
We quantify this increase in rotational diffusion against the temperature
difference across the poles of the Janus sphere as well as the average surface
temperature difference from the ambient fluid.We show that later quantification
is better and results in a data collapse for different choices of the
microscopic interaction. The average propulsion velocity is also measured for
different choices of the wetting parameter. The directionality of
self-propulsion changes depending on the microscopic interaction. We show that
whenever the attractive interaction of the colloid with the solvent is switched
off, the phoretic mobility changes sign. Further, the propulsion velocity is
zero for heating below a certain threshold value. Finally, we combine the
measured propulsion velocity and the rotational diffusion time to estimate the
enhancement in the long time diffusion coefficient of the particle.

useful signal strength and interference at the strong and weak users, which is
a generalized version of the existing beamforming designs in the context of
physical layer security for NOMA. We determine the optimal power allocation
among useful signals and AN together with the two optimal beamforming scalars
in order to maximize the secrecy sum rate (SSR). Our asymptotic analysis in the
high signal-to-noise ratio regime provides an efficient and near-optimal
solution to optimizing the beamforming scalars and power allocation
coefficients. Our analysis indicates that it is not optimal to form a beam
towards either the strong user or the weak user in NOMA systems for security
enhancement. In addition, the asymptotically optimal power allocation informs
that, as the transmit power increases, more power should be allocated to the
weak user or AN signals, while the power allocated to the strong user keeps
constant. Our examination shows that the proposed novel beamforming design can
significantly outperform two benchmark schemes.

computing equilibria using strong hierarchies of convex relaxations. Such
results however only apply to the problem of computing equilibria that optimize
a certain objective function and not to the (arguably more fundamental) task of
finding \emph{any} equilibrium.
  We present an algorithmic model based on the sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy
that allows escaping this inherent limitation of integrality gaps. In this
model, algorithms access the input game only through a relaxed solution to the
natural SoS relaxation for computing equilibria. They can then adaptively
construct a list of candidate solutions and invoke a verification oracle to
check if any candidate on the list is a solution. This model captures most
well-studied approximation algorithms such as those for Max-Cut, Sparsest Cut,
and Unique-Games.
  The state-of-the-art algorithms for computing exact and approximate
equilibria in two-player, n-strategy games are captured in this model and
require that at least one of i) size (~ running time) of the SoS relaxation or
ii) the size of the list of candidates, be at least $2^{\Omega(n)}$ and
$n^{\Omega(\log{(n)})}$ respectively. Our main result shows a lower bound that
matches these upper bound up to constant factors in the exponent.
  This can be interpreted as an unconditional confirmation, in our restricted
algorithmic framework, of Rubinstein's recent conditional hardness \cite{Rub}
for computing approximate equilibria.
  Our proof strategy involves constructing a family of games that all share a
common sum-of-squares solution but every (approximate) equilibrium of one game
is far from every (approximate) equilibrium of any other game in the family.

present results from a careful analysis of pulsating auroral patches using

we follow in the patch frame of reference. In this way we avoid the space-time
ambiguity which complicates rocket and satellite measurements. We find that the
shape of the patches is remarkably persistent with 85-100% of the patch being
repeated for 4.5-8.5 min. Each of the three largest patches has a temporal
correlation with a negative dependence on distance, and thus does not fluctuate
in a coherent fashion. A time-delayed response within the patches indicates
that the so-called streaming mode might explain the incoherency. The patches
appear to drift differently from the SuperDARN-determined

However, in a nonrotating reference frame the patches drift with 230-287 m/s in

Galactic field. Another major difference between the EHB stars in $\omega$ Cen
and the field is the fraction of close binaries. From our radial velocity
survey we identify two binary candidates and estimate an EHB close binary
fraction of ~5% in $\omega$ Cen. This low fraction is in line with findings for
other GGCs, but in sharp contrast to the situation in the field, where around
50% of the sdB stars reside in close binaries. Finally, the mass distribution
derived is very similar for all three spectroscopic groups, however the average
mass (0.38 Msun) is lower than that expected from stellar evolution theory.
While this mass conundrum has previously been noted for EHB stars in $\omega$
Cen, it so far appears to be unique to that cluster.

is automatically adjusted to the optimal working condition under a wide range

single-harmonic oscillation are adopted to increase the overall efficiency. An
example system is designed with the use of a capacitive coupling link. It
realizes a virtual, nearly-ideal oscillating voltage source at the load site,
giving efficient power transfer comparable to that of the ideal
wired-connection scenario. We numerically and experimentally verify the
robustness of the WPT system under the variations of load and coupling, where
coupling is changing by our varying the alignment of aluminum plates. The
working frequency and the transferred power agree well with analytical models.
The proposed paradigm can have a significant impact on future high-performance
WPT devices. The designed system can also work as a smart table supporting
multiple receivers with robust and efficient operation.

compressed, exact and lossless data structures that achieve, at the same time,
high space reductions and no time degradation with respect to state-of-the-art
solutions and related software packages. In particular, we present a compressed
trie data structure in which each word following a context of fixed length k,
i.e., its preceding k words, is encoded as an integer whose value is
proportional to the number of words that follow such context. Since the number
of words following a given context is typically very small in natural
languages, we lower the space of representation to compression levels that were
never achieved before. Despite the significant savings in space, our technique
introduces a negligible penalty at query time. Regarding the problem of
estimation, we present a novel algorithm for estimating modified Kneser-Ney
language models, that have emerged as the de-facto choice for language modeling
in both academia and industry, thanks to their relatively low perplexity
performance. Estimating such models from large textual sources poses the
challenge of devising algorithms that make a parsimonious use of the disk. The
state-of-the-art algorithm uses three sorting steps in external memory: we show
an improved construction that requires only one sorting step thanks to
exploiting the properties of the extracted n-gram strings. With an extensive
experimental analysis performed on billions of n-grams, we show an average
improvement of 4.5X on the total running time of the state-of-the-art approach.

bonded due to the strong attractions. Without repulsions, the gel forms at the
spinodal through arrested phase separation. In the ergodic suspension at
sufficiently high densities, colloidal clusters form temporary networks that
percolate space. Recently [Nat. Commun. 7, 11817 (2016)], it has been proposed
that the transition of these networks to directed percolation coincides with
the onset of the dynamic arrest, thus linking structure to dynamics. Here, we
evaluate for various screening lengths the underlying gas-liquid binodal and
the percolation transitions. We find that directed percolation shifts the
continuous percolation line to larger densities, but even beyond this line the
suspension remains ergodic. Only when approaching the spinodal does dynamic
arrest occur. Competing repulsions thus do not modify the qualitative scenario
for non-equilibrium gelation, although the structure of the emerging

show that the expansion of the radio source drives fast shocks (with velocities
v>500km/s) that ionize and accelerate the outflowing gas. At odds with the
properties of other compact, peaked-spectrum radio sources hosting warm ionized
gas outflows, we do not find signs of kinematically disturbed or outflowing gas
in phases colder than the warm ionized gas. We argue that this is due to the
young age of our source and thus to the recent nature of the AGN-ISM
interaction, and suggest that cold gas forms within the outflowing material and
the shock-ionized outflowing gas of PKSB1934-63 did not have enough time to
cool down, and accumulate in a colder phase. This scenario is also supported by
the multi-phase outflows of other compact and young radio sources in the
literature.

droplets during their arrested coalescence has been investigated using
micromanipulation experiments. Ellipsoidal droplets are produced by
millifluidic emulsification of petrolatum into a yield stress fluid that
preserves their elongated shape. The liquid meniscus between droplets can
transmit stress and instigate movement of the droplets, from their initial
relative position, in order to minimize doublet surface energy. The action of
the liquid meniscus causes the ellipsoidal droplets to undergo rolling and
restructuring events because of their unique ellipsoid shape and associated
variation in surface curvature. The final configuration of the droplets is
shown to be controlled by the balance between interfacial Laplace pressure and
internal elasticity, as well as a constraint force that resists complete
minimization of surface energy. Geometric and surface energy calculations are
used to map the possible and most likely configurations of the droplet pairs.
Experimental deviations from the calculations indicate the magnitude and
potential origin of the constraint force resisting full equilibration. Droplet
aspect ratio and elasticity are both shown to influence the degree of
restructuring and stability of the droplets at energy extrema. Higher aspect
ratios drive greater restructuring and better agreement with final doublet
configurations predicted by energy minimization. Lower elasticity droplets
undergo secondary deformations at high aspect ratios, further broadening the
space of possible morphologies.

effect on behavior. Such features may correspond to a single point (e.g., dens
or kill sites), or to higher-dimensional subspaces (e.g., rivers or lakes).
Features may be relatively static in time (e.g., coastlines or home-range
centers), or may be dynamic (e.g., sea ice extent or areas of high-quality
forage for herbivores). We introduce a novel model for animal movement that
incorporates active selection for dynamic features in a landscape.
  Our approach is motivated by the study of polar bear (Ursus maritimus)
movement. During the sea ice melt season, polar bears spend much of their time
on sea ice above shallow, biologically productive water where they hunt seals.
The changing distribution and characteristics of sea ice throughout the late
spring through early fall means that the location of valuable habitat is
constantly shifting. We develop a model for the movement of polar bears that
accounts for the effect of this important landscape feature. We introduce a
two-stage procedure for approximate Bayesian inference that allows us to

anisotropic two-point correlation function measurements. Our comparison
includes seven approximate methods, which can be divided into three categories:
predictive methods that follow the evolution of the linear density field
deterministically (ICE-COLA, Peak Patch, and Pinocchio), methods that require a
calibration with N-body simulations (Patchy and Halogen), and simpler recipes
based on assumptions regarding the shape of the probability distribution
function (PDF) of density fluctuations (log-normal and Gaussian density
fields). We analyse the impact of using covariance estimates obtained from
these approximate methods on cosmological analyses of galaxy clustering
measurements, using as a reference the covariances inferred from a set of full
N-body simulations. We find that all approximate methods can accurately recover
the mean parameter values inferred using the N-body covariances. The obtained
parameter uncertainties typically agree with the corresponding N-body results
within 5% for our lower mass threshold, and 10% for our higher mass threshold.
Furthermore, we find that the constraints for some methods can differ by up to
20% depending on whether the halo samples used to define the covariance
matrices are defined by matching the mass, number density, or clustering
amplitude of the parent N-body samples. The results of our configuration-space
analysis indicate that most approximate methods provide similar results, with
no single method clearly outperforming the others.

magnetohydrodynamical simulations present the advantage of having only a small
number of tunable parameters, and produce in a dynamically self-consistent
manner the flows and the dynamo magnetic fields pervading stellar interiors. We
conducted a series of such simulations within the EULAG-MHD framework, varying
the rotation rate and luminosity of the modeled solar-like convective
envelopes. We find decadal magnetic cycles when the Rossby number near the base

shorter cycles located at the top of the convective envelope close to the
equator are also observed in our numerical experiments, when the local Rossby
number is lower than 1. The deep-seated dynamo sustained in these numerical
experiments is fundamentally non-linear, in that it is the feedback of the
large-scale magnetic field on the large-scale differential rotation that sets
the magnetic cycle period. The cycle period is found to decrease with the
Rossby number, which offers an alternative theoretical explanation to the

Since then, path integrals have pervaded all areas of physics where fluctuation

based on the fact that one converts a problem formulated in terms of operators
into one of sampling classical paths with a given weight. Path integrals are
the mirror image of our conventional Riemann integrals, with functions
replacing the real numbers one usually sums over. However, unlike conventional
integrals, path integration suffers a serious drawback: in general, one cannot
make non-linear changes of variables without committing an error of some sort.
Thus, no path-integral based calculus is possible. Here we identify which are

via the DP mechanism for a 2D semiconductor with an elliptic band structure.
Within the effective-mass approximation, the low-energy band structure is
described using anisotropic in-plane effective mass of free carriers. Spin
relaxation time of free carriers is calculated theoretically using the time
evolution equation of the density matrix of a polarized spin ensemble in the
strong momentum scattering regime. Results are obtained for scattering
potential due to both Coulomb interaction and neutral defects in the sample. We
show that the ratio of spin relaxation time in the y- and x-direction within
the 2D plane displays a power-law dependence on the effective mass ratio, while
the exponent captures the details of the scattering potential. The model is
applied to study electron spin relaxation in monolayer black phosphorus, which
is known to exhibit significant band structure ellipticity. The model can also
predict spin relaxation anisotropy in mechanically strained 2D materials in
which elliptic band structure emerges as a consequence of the modification of
the lattice constants.

nuclear activity. This analysis has been performed on rest-frame optical
spectra taken with LBT-LUCI. The spectral coverage allowed us to observe
emission lines such as Halpha, Hbeta, [Oiii]5007 A, and [Nii]6583 A at the z of
the central RG. We observed the central part of the protocluster, which is
suitable to include the radio galaxy, several spectroscopically confirmed AGN
belonging to the protocluster, and other objects that might be members of the
protocluster. For four previously identified protocluster members, we derived
the redshift by detecting emission lines that have never detected before for
these galaxies. The stacked spectrum of the galaxies in which we detected the
[Oiii]5007 A emission line revealed the presence of the second line of the
[Oiii] doublet at 4959 A and of Hbeta, which confirms that they belong to the
protocluster. By collecting all members identified so far in this work and
other members from the literature, we defined 31 galaxies, including the
central RG, around z = 1.4152 +/- 0.056, corresponding to peculiar velocities
<~5000 km/s with respect to the RG. The PV phase-space diagram suggests that 3
protocluster AGN and the central RG might be a virialized population that has
been coexisting for a long time in the densest core region of this forming
structure. This protocluster is characterized by a high fraction of AGN (23%).
For one of them, AGN1317, we produced 2 BPT diagrams. The high fraction of AGN
and their distribution within the protocluster seem to be consistent with
predictions of some theoretical models on AGN growth and feedback.

imagery from STEREO-A/B and SDO we are able to track and study the entire
evolution of the CH having a continuous 360$\deg$ coverage of the Sun. The
remote sensing data are investigated together with in-situ solar wind plasma
and magnetic field measurements from STEREO-A/B, ACE and WIND. From this we
obtain how different evolutionary states of the CH as observed in the solar
atmosphere (changes in EUV intensity and area) affect the properties of the
associated high-speed stream measured at $1$AU. Most distinctly pronounced for
the CH area, three development phases are derived: a) growing, b) maximum, and
c) decaying phase. During these phases the CH area a) increases over a duration
of around three months from about $1 \cdot 10^{10} \mathrm{km}^{2}$ to $6 \cdot
10^{10} \mathrm{km}^{2}$, b) keeps a rather constant area for about one month
of $> 9 \cdot 10^{10} \mathrm{km}^{2}$, and c) finally decreases in the
following three months below $1 \cdot 10^{10} \mathrm{km}^{2}$ until the CH
cannot be identified anymore. The three phases manifest themselves also in the
EUV intensity and in in-situ measured solar wind proton bulk velocity.
Interestingly, the three phases are related to a different range in solar wind
speed variations and we find for the growing phase a range of
$460-600$~km~s$^{-1}$, for the maximum phase $600-720$~km~s$^{-1}$, and for the
decaying phase a more irregular behavior connected to slow and fast solar wind
speed of $350-550$~km~s$^{-1}$.

attacks on programs written in memory unsafe languages. Dual stack schemes for
protecting return addresses promise an efficient and effective defense against
such attacks. By introducing a second, safe stack to separate return addresses
from potentially unsafe stack objects, they prevent attacks that, for example,
maliciously modify a return address by overflowing a buffer. However, the
security of dual stacks is based on the concealment of the safe stack in

information disclosure attacks that are able to reveal the safe stack location,
and therefore effectively break their promised security properties. In this
paper, we present a new, leak-resilient dual stack scheme capable of
withstanding sophisticated information disclosure attacks. We carefully study
previous dual stack schemes and systematically develop a novel design for stack
separation that eliminates flaws leading to the disclosure of safe stacks. We
show the feasibility and practicality of our approach by presenting a full

that solve for halo density evolution deterministically using Lagrangian
trajectories (ICE-COLA, Pinocchio and PeakPatch), methods that rely on halo
assignment schemes onto dark-matter overdensities calibrated with a target
N-body run (Halogen, Patchy) and two standard assumptions about the full
density PDF (Gaussian and Lognormal). We benchmark their performance against a
set of three hundred N-body simulations, running similar sets of approximate
simulations with matched initial conditions, for each method. We find that most
methods reproduce the monopole to within $5\%$, while residuals for the
quadrupole are sometimes larger and scale dependent. The variance of the
multipoles is typically reproduced within $10\%$. Overall, we find that
covariances built from approximate simulations yield errors on model parameters

measurement for tumor extent to evaluate treatment responses in cancer
patients. As such, RECIST annotations must be accurate. However, RECIST
annotations manually labeled by radiologists require professional knowledge and
are time-consuming, subjective, and prone to inconsistency among different
observers. To alleviate these problems, we propose a cascaded convolutional
neural network based method to semi-automatically label RECIST annotations and
drastically reduce annotation time. The proposed method consists of two stages:
lesion region normalization and RECIST estimation. We employ the spatial
transformer network (STN) for lesion region normalization, where a localization
network is designed to predict the lesion region and the transformation
parameters with a multi-task learning strategy. For RECIST estimation, we adapt
the stacked hourglass network (SHN), introducing a relationship constraint loss
to improve the estimation precision. STN and SHN can both be learned in an
end-to-end fashion. We train our system on the DeepLesion dataset, obtaining a
consensus model trained on RECIST annotations performed by multiple
radiologists over a multi-year period. Importantly, when judged against the
inter-reader variability of two additional radiologist raters, our system

magnetic fields. However the corresponding ALP mass and coupling are in a
severe tension with the observational constraints from CAST, SN1987A, and other

quantitatively consistent with the decreasing entropy of chains at the

The SuSAM* model exploits the approximation of factorization of the scaling

approach is based on the relativistic mean field theory of nuclear matter where
a relativistic effective mass for the nucleon encodes the dynamics of nucleons
moving in presence of scalar and vector potentials. Both the scaling variable
$\psi^*$ and the single nucleon cross sections include the effective mass as a
parameter to be fitted to the data alongside the Fermi momentum $k_F$. Several
methods to extract the scaling function and its uncertainty from the data are
proposed and compared. The model predictions for the quasielastic cross section

We employ near-field local probing to spectrally resolve and electrostatically

the neutrino experiments. To ascertain this possibility, ten brain samples from
Alzheimer patients and blanks as well as 10 samples of brain tumors have been
investigated and results were cross-checked with two different spectrometers.
Localization of the samples in the brain was not known to avoid biased
interpretation of the results. Data taking lasted between 1 and 4 weeks for
each sample. All ten Alzheimer/blank samples were below the limit of detection
(LOD), 3 out of the 10 tumors lead to positive results (3.8 to 4.9 mBq/g of

Potential followup of this method is to enhance the detector sensitivity,
having the spectrometer installed in an underground laboratory such as the one

usually identify another person after just seeing that given person a few times
(or even once) by attending to their memory. On the other hand, the unique
nature of the person re-identification problem, i.e., only few examples exist
per identity and new identities always appearing during testing, calls for a
few shot learning architecture with the capacity of handling new identities.
Hence, we frame the problem within a meta-learning setting, where a neural
network based meta-learner is trained to optimize a learner i.e., an
attention-based matching function. Another challenge of the person
re-identification problem is the small inter-class difference between different
identities and large intra-class difference of the same identity. In order to
increase the discriminative power of the model, we propose a new
attention-based feature encoding scheme that takes into account the critical
intra-view and cross-view relationship of images. We refer to the proposed
Attention-based Re-identification Metalearning model as ARM. Extensive

quantum physics using simple thought experiments. We derive all relevant
quantum predictions using minimal mathematics, without introducing the advanced
calculations that are typically used to describe quantum physics. We focus on
the two key surprises of quantum physics, namely wave-particle duality, a term
that was introduced to capture the fact that single quantum particles in some
respects behave like waves and in other respects like particles, and
entanglement, which applies to two or more quantum particles and brings out the
inherent contradiction between quantum physics and seemingly obvious
assumptions regarding the nature of reality. Following arguments originally
made by John Bell and Lucien Hardy, we show that the so-called local hidden
variables are inadequate at explaining the behavior of entangled quantum
particles. This means that one either has to give up on hidden variables, i.e.,
the idea that the outcomes of measurements on quantum particles are determined
before an experiment is actually carried out, or one has to relinquish the
principle of locality, which requires that no causal influences should be
faster than the speed of light and is a cornerstone of Einstein's theory of
relativity. Finally, we describe how these remarkable predictions of quantum
physics have been confirmed in experiments. We have successfully used the
present approach in a course that is open to all undergraduate students at the

stars and supper massive stars, is an interplay between general relativistic
effects and the equation of state of nuclear matter. In the present work, we
use the Chandrasekhar criterion of stellar instability by employing a large
number of realistic equations of state (EoS) of neutron star matter. We mainly
focus on the critical point of transition from stable to unstable
configuration. This point corresponds to the maximum neutron star mass
configuration. We calculate, in each case, the resulting compactness parameter,
$\beta=GM/c^2R$, and the corresponding effective adiabatic index, $\gamma_{\rm
cr}$. The role of the trial function $\xi(r)$ is presented and discussed in
details. We found that it holds a model-independent relation between
$\gamma_{\rm cr}$ and $\beta$. This statement is strongly supported by the
large number of EoS and it is also corroborated by using analytical solutions
of the Einstein's field equations. In addition, we present and discuss the
relation between the maximum rotation rate and the adiabatic index close to the
instability limit. Accurate observational measurements of the upper bound of
the neutron star mass and the corresponding radius, in connection with the
present predictions, may help to impose constraints on the high density part of
the neutron star equation of state.

maximum light, consistent with massive ejecta if we assume a
radioactive-powering scenario. We study the late-time light curve of iPTF15dtg,
which turned out to be extraordinarily luminous for a stripped-envelope (SE)
SN. We compare the observed light curves to those of other SE SNe and also with
models for the $^{56}$Co decay. We analyze and compare the spectra to nebular
spectra of other SE SNe. We build a bolometric light curve and fit it with
different models, including powering by radioactivity, magnetar powering, as
well as a combination of the two. Between 150 d and 750 d past explosion,
iPTF15dtg's luminosity declined by merely two magnitudes instead of the six
magnitudes expected from $^{56}$Co decay. This is the first
spectroscopically-regular SE SN showing this behavior. The model with both
radioactivity and magnetar powering provides the best fit to the light curve
and appears to be the more realistic powering mechanism. An alternative
mechanism might be CSM interaction. However, the spectra of iPTF15dtg are very
similar to those of other SE SNe, and do not show signs of strong CSM
interaction. iPTF15dtg is the first spectroscopically-regular SE SN whose light
curve displays such clear signs of a magnetar contributing to the powering of
the late time light curve. Given this result, the mass of the ejecta needs to
be revised to a lower value, and therefore the progenitor mass could be
significantly lower than the previously estimated $>$35 $M_{\odot}$.

with the PXI interface and SFP+ transceiver for data transmission. When the

channel achieves an analog bandwidth higher than 200MHz and an ENOB of more
than 9 bits at a 1GS/s sampling rate. Owing to such high speed and resolution,
the system may facilitate improvements in extracting maximum information from

high-speed logic designs to reach the fast data rate requirements. They are
mostly coded in a hardware description language (HDL). However, in recent
years, high level synthesis (HLS) compilers have appeared, with the notable
advantage that they rely on the widespread C/C++ syntax. This paper's aim is to
outline differences between HDL and C/C++ HLS based designs for two real-time
data acquisition modules used in nuclear science. The first module is a
real-time crystal identification module, and the second is a compact event
timestamp sorting module. This evaluation was done by an experienced VHDL
programmer with no prior HLS training. For the crystal identification module,
both HDL and HLS versions have the same event processing interval, and the HLS
implementation consumes twice as many lookup tables and flip flops as the HDL
version. On the other hand, the HLS version took half the time to write and
debug. For the sorter module, the HLS version requires about 3 to 4 times more
logic resources, with a slightly longer processing interval. It was also
completed in half the time compared to the original HDL code. While different
compiler directives can still be explored to improve source code clarity,
resource usage and timing closure in these designs, this trial shows that HLS
is a compelling alternative to custom HDL implementations for real time systems
in nuclear and plasma science.

to their excellent properties which enable substrate protection against
corrosion and wear. Depending on their composition and structure, as-plated
deposits demonstrate good mechanical, tribological and electrochemical
features, catalytic activity but also beneficial magnetic characteristics. With
subsequent thermal treatment hardness of Ni-P metal-metalloid system can
approach or be even higher than that of hard Cr coatings. The purpose of this
paper is to provide a general survey of the research work dealing with the
electrodeposition of Ni-P binary alloy coatings. Proposed phosphorus
incorporation mechanisms, Ni-P alloy microstructure before and after thermal
treatment, its mechanical, tribological, corrosion, catalytic and magnetic
properties are considered, so are the key process variables influencing
phosphorus content in the deposits and the roles of the main electrolytic bath
constituents. Findings on the merits of employing pulse plating and fabrication
of unconventional (layered and functionally graded) structures are succinctly
explored.

  LEDs (Extended Version)","10 pages, 11 figures, and 2 tables",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose an accurate visible light indoor localization
system for a smartphone using the existing commercial light-emitting diode
(LED) luminaries. The proposed technique, called geometrical optics positioning
algorithm (GOPA), uses spatial color code landmarks alongside angle of arrival
(AOA)-based geometrical algorithm on smartphones to locate the device, and
reserves LED's time-frequency domain modulation to increase the throughput of
the visible light network broadcast from the same luminaries infrastructure.
GOPA algorithm is developed with practical considerations such as flexible hand
gesture and handshake, and it enables both positioning robustness and on-device
processing. By introducing the idea of virtual plane, field of view (FOV) issue
of AOA-based positioning systems is addressed in GOPA. The embedded
accelerometer and front-facing camera of the smartphone are used at the
receiver side to measure the smartphone inclination and acquire the image.
Experimental results show robust two-dimensional ($2$-D) and three-dimensional
($3$-D) positioning. The experimental mean positioning error for $2$-D
positioning is $0.54$ cm, in case one ignoring the tilt. The experimental mean
positioning errors for $3$-D positioning are respectively $1.24$ cm, $1.85$ cm,
and $6.02$ cm for ideal non-tilted and non-oriented, non-tilted but orientated,
and both tilted and orientated scenarios.

  Gauge Symmetry Group $SU(2)\otimes U(1)$","40 pages, 4 figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the formation of structured and massless particles with spin 1,
by using the Yang-Mills like stochastic equations system for the group symmetry
$SU(2)\otimes U(1)$ without taking into account the nonlinear term
characterizing self-action. We prove that, in the first phase of relaxation, as
a result of multi-scale random fluctuations of quantum fields, massless
particles with spin 1, further referred as \emph{hions}, are generated in the
form of statistically stable quantized structures, which are localized on 2$D$
topological manifolds. We also study the wave state and the geometrical
structure of the \emph{hion} when as a free particle and, accordingly, while it
interacts with a random environment becoming a quasi-particle with a finite
lifetime. In the second phase of relaxation, the vector boson makes spontaneous
transitions to other massless and mass states. The problem of entanglement of
two \emph{hions} with opposite projections of the spins $+1$ and $-1$ and the
formation of a scalar zero-spin boson are also thoroughly studied. We analyze
the properties of the scalar field and show that it corresponds to the
Bose-Einstein (BE) condensate. The scalar boson decay problems, as well as a
number of features characterizing the stability of BE condensate, are also
discussed. Then, we report on the structure of empty space-time in the context
of new properties of the quantum vacuum, implying on the existence of a natural
quantum computer with complicated logic, which manifests in the form of dark
energy. The possibilities of space-time engineering are also discussed.

is one of the main challenges towards the energy transition. Local energy
markets, enabling direct exchange of energy between prosumers, help to
integrate the growing number of residential photovoltaic panels by scheduling
flexible demand for balancing renewable energy locally. Nevertheless, existing
scheduling mechanisms do not take into account the phases to which households
are connected, increasing network unbalance and favoring bigger voltage
rises/drops and higher losses. In this paper, we reduce network unbalance by
leveraging market transactions information to dynamically allocate houses to
phases using solid state switches. We propose cost effective mechanisms for the
selection of households to switch and for their optimal allocation to phases.
Using load flow analysis we show that only 6% of houses in our case studies
need to be equipped with dynamic switches to counteract the negative impact of
local energy markets while maintaining all the benefits. Combining local energy
markets and dynamic phase switching we improve both overall load balancing and
network unbalance, effectively augmenting DER hosting capacity of distribution
grids.

Modelling (FEM) simulations. To validate this approach we first performed FEM
analysis of standard fibres and used this to evaluate the coupling efficiency
between two singlemode fibres under different conditions. The results of these
simulations were successfully compared with those obtained using classical
analytical approaches, by demonstrating a maximum loss deviation of about 0.4

to the analytical models. FEM simulations allow addressing any type of guiding

cross section and involved materials. We propose as example of application the

overcome some drawbacks observed in the homogenization of beam lattices. To
this end an enhanced homogenization technique is proposed and formulated to
obtain consistent micropolar continuum models of the beam lattices and able to
simulate with good approximation the boundary layer effects and the
Floquet-Bloch spectrum of the Lagrangian model. The continualization technique
here proposed is based on a transformation of the difference equation of motion
of the discrete system via a proper down-scaling law into a pseudo-differential
problem; a further McLaurin approximation is applied to obtain a higher order
differential problem. The formulation is carried out for simple one-dimensional
beam lattices that are, nevertheless, characterized by a rather wide variety of
static and dynamic behaviors: the rod lattice, the beam lattice with node
rotations and a 1D beam lattice model with generalized displacements. Higher
order models may be obtained which are characterized by differential problems
involving non-local inertia terms together with spatial high gradient terms.
Moreover, the homogenized models obtained by the proposed enhanced
continualization technique turn out to be energetically consistent and provide
a good simulation of both the static response and of the acoustic spectrum of
the original discrete models. The proposed homogenization procedure is first
presented for the simple case of monoatomic axial chains. The beam lattice with
node rotations and displacement prevented exhibits, in the static regime,
decaying oscillations of the nodal rotation in the boundary layer which is well
simulated by the homogenized model obtained by the proposed approach.
