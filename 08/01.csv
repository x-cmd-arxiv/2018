cavity mode. The interacting system can be effectively described by two coupled
oscillators with positive and negative mass when the two-level atoms are
prepared in their excited states. The occurrence of symmetry breaking is
controlled by the atomic detuning and the coupling to the cavity mode, which
naturally divides the parameter space into the symmetry broken and symmetry
unbroken phases. The two phases are separated by a spectral singularity, a
so-called exceptional point, where the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian coalesce.
When encircling the singularity in the parameter space, the quasi-adiabatic
dynamics shows chiral mode switching which enables topological manipulation of

tangent to the caustic. Contours tangent from the inner side of the caustic
generate peaks, while those tangent from its outer side generate edges. We
derive analytical shapes of the generated features and map the peak strength as

determined by the positional geometry of the caustic relative to the $g$-factor

interdependencies. A multilayer interdependent network consists of a set of
graphs $G$ that are interconnected through a weighted interconnection matrix $
B $, where the weight of each inter-graph link is a non-negative real number $
p $. Various dynamical processes, such as synchronization, cascading failures
in power grids, and diffusion processes, are described by the Laplacian matrix
$ Q $ characterizing the whole system. For the case in which the multilayer
graph is a multiplex, where the number of nodes in each layer is the same and
the interconnection matrix $ B=pI $, being $ I $ the identity matrix, it has
been shown that there exists a structural transition at some critical coupling,
$ p^* $. This transition is such that dynamical processes are separated into
two regimes: if $ p > p^* $, the network acts as a whole; whereas when $ p<p^*
$, the network operates as if the graphs encoding the layers were isolated. In
this paper, we extend and generalize the structural transition threshold $ p^*
$ to a regular interconnection matrix $ B $ (constant row and column sum).
Specifically, we provide upper and lower bounds for the transition threshold $
p^* $ in interdependent networks with a regular interconnection matrix $ B $
and derive the exact transition threshold for special scenarios using the
formalism of quotient graphs. Additionally, we discuss the physical meaning of
the transition threshold $ p^* $ in terms of the minimum cut and show, through
a counter-example, that the structural transition does not always exist. Our
results are one step forward on the characterization of more realistic
multilayer networks and might be relevant for systems that deviate from the
topological constrains imposed by multiplex networks.

real-world applications, this is unlikely. In this paper, we look for
efficiently solvable games with multiple followers who play either
optimistically or pessimistically, i.e., breaking ties in favour or against the
leader. We study the computational complexity of finding or approximating an

succinct games---polymatrix like---which are equivalent to 2-player Bayesian
games with uncertainty over the follower, with interdependent or independent

games the computation is harder even when players are forced to play pure

very close to the planet, which makes it a good candidate for radio
observations. We expect similar conditions as for Jupiter, i.e. a region
between the exobase and the magnetopause that is filled with a depleted plasma
density compared with cases where the whole magnetosphere cavity is filled with
hydrodynamically outward flowing ionospheric plasma. Thus, unlike classical hot

(MIMO) channel sounder for the 28 GHz band. Until now, most investigations of
the directional characteristics of millimeter-wave channels have used
mechanically rotating horn antennas. In contrast, the sounder presented here is
capable of performing horizontal and vertical beam steering with the help of
phased arrays. Due to its fast beam-switching capability, the proposed sounder
can perform measurements that are directionally resolved both at the
transmitter(TX) and receiver (RX) in 1.44 milliseconds compared to the minutes
or even hours required for rotating horn antenna sounders. This not only
enables measurement of more TX-RX locations for a better statistical validity
but also allows to perform directional analysis in dynamic environments. The
short measurement time combined with the high phase stability limits the phase
drift between TX and RX, enabling phase-coherent sounding of all beam pairs
even when TX and RX have no cabled connection for synchronization without any
delay ambiguity. Furthermore, the phase stability over time enables complex RX
waveform averaging to improve the signal to noise ratio during high path loss
measurements. The paper discusses both the system design as well as the
measurements performed for verification of the sounder performance.
Furthermore, we present sample results from double directional measurements in
dynamic environments.

observational baseline of 27 days. For planets with orbital periods longer than
13.5 days, TESS can only capture one or two transits, and the planet
ephemerides will be difficult to determine from TESS data alone. Follow-up
observations of transits of these candidates will require precise ephemerides.
We explore the use of existing ground-based wide-field photometric surveys to
constrain the ephemerides of the TESS single-transit candidates, with a focus
on the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) survey. We insert simulated
TESS-detected single transits into KELT light curves, and evaluate how well
their orbital periods can be recovered. We find that KELT photometry can be
used to confirm ephemerides with high accuracy for planets of Saturn size or
larger with orbital periods as long as a year, and therefore span a wide range
of planet equilibrium temperatures. In a large fraction of the sky we recover
30% to 50% of warm Jupiter systems (planet radius of 0.9 to 1.1 R_J and 13.5 <

30% of warm Saturns (planet radius of 0.5 to 0.9 R_J and 13.5 < P < 50 days).
The resulting ephemerides can be used for follow-up observations to confirm
candidates as planets, eclipsing binaries, or other false positives, as well as
to conduct detailed transit observations with facilities like JWST or HST.

perturbations. In the standard picture, this protection is guaranteed by a high
degree of spatial nonlocality of the Majoranas, namely a suppressed
wave-function overlap, in the topological phase. However, a careful
characterisation of resilience to local noise goes beyond mere spatial
separation, and must also take into account the projection of wave-function
spin. By considering the susceptibility of a given zero mode to different local
perturbations, we find the relevant forms of spin-resolved wave-function
overlaps that measure its resilience. We quantify these overlaps and study
their dependence with nanowire parameters in several classes of experimentally
relevant configurations. These include nanowires with inhomogeneous depletion
and induced pairing, barriers and quantum dots. Smooth inhomogeneities have
been shown to produce near-zero modes, so-called pseudo-Majoranas, below the
critical Zeeman field in the bulk. Surprisingly, their resilience is found to
be comparable or better than that of topological Majoranas in realistic
systems. We further study how accurately their overlaps can be estimated using
a purely local measurement on one end of the nanowire, accessible through
conventional transport experiments. In uniform nanowires this local estimator
is remarkably accurate. In inhomogeneous cases it is less accurate but can
still provide reasonable estimates for potential inhomogeneities of the order
of the superconducting gap. We further analyse the zero mode wave-function
structure, spin texture and spectral features associated with each type of
inhomogeneity. All our results highlight the strong connection between internal
wave-function degrees of freedom, nonlocality and protection in smoothly
inhomogeneous nanowires.

measurements of charged hadron production $dN_{\rm ch}/d\eta$ in all such
collision systems over a broad pseudorapidity range and as a function of

a similarly broad pseudorapidity range. These measurements provide key
constraints on models of particle emission and their translation into flow.

  http://www.theses.fr/2014AIXM4781",,,,"math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this thesis we prove analytic results about a cohomotopical Seiberg-Witten
theory for a Riemannian, Spin$^c$(4), 4-manifold with periodic ends, $(X, g,
{\tau})$ . Our results show that, under certain technical assumptions on $(X,
g, {\tau})$, this new version is coherent and leads to Seiberg-Witten type
invariants for this new class of 4-manifolds.
  In the first part, using Taubes criteria for end-periodic operators, we show
that for a Riemannian 4-manifold with periodic ends, $(X, g)$, verifying
certain topological conditions, the Laplacian, $\Delta_+ : L^2_2({\Lambda^2}_+)
\rightarrow L^2({\Lambda^2}_+)$, is a Fredholm operator. This allows us to
prove a Hodge type decomposition for positively weighted Sobolev 1-forms on
$(X,g)$. We also prove, assuming non-negative scalar curvature on each end and
certain technical topological conditions, that the associated Dirac operator
associated with an end-periodic connection (which is ASD at infinity) is
Fredholm.
  In the second part we establish an isomorphism between the de Rham cohomology
group, $H^{1}_{\mathrm{dR}}(X,i\mathbb{R})$ (which is a topological invariant
of X) and the harmonic group intervening in the above Hodge type decomposition
of the space of positively weighted 1-forms on $(X,g)$. We also prove two short
exact sequences relating the gauge group of the Seiberg-Witten moduli problem
and the cohomology group $H^{1}(X, 2{\pi}i\mathbb{Z})$.
  In the third part, we prove the main results: the coercivity of the
Seiberg-Witten map and the compactness of the moduli space for a 4-manifold
with periodic ends, $(X,g,{\tau})$, verifying the above conditions. Finally,
using the coercitivity property, we show that a Seiberg-Witten type cohomotopy
invariant associated to $(X, g, {\tau})$ can be defined

Another metrologically useful state is an equal superposition of two
eigenstates with maximally different energies; this state ideally reaches the
full interferometric sensitivity allowed by quantum mechanics. By leveraging
improvements to our apparatus made primarily to reach higher operation
fidelities in quantum information processing, we extend a technique to create
number states up to $n=100$ and to generate superpositions of a harmonic
oscillator ground state and a number state of the form
$\textstyle{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}(\lvert 0\rangle+\lvert n\rangle)$ with $n$ up

sensitivity to changes in the oscillator frequency that initially increases
linearly with $n$, with maximal value at $n=12$ where we observe 3.2(2) dB
higher sensitivity compared to an ideal measurement on a coherent state with
the same average occupation number. The quantum advantage from using
number-state superpositions can be leveraged towards precision measurements on
any harmonic oscillator system; here it enables us to track the average
fractional frequency of oscillation of a single trapped ion to approximately
2.6 $\times$ 10$^{-6}$ in 5 s. Such measurements should provide improved

individual models in the ensemble through the use of different data
augmentation techniques. The goal is to ensure that at least one of the

low energy $\pi\pi$ scattering. Since the corresponding phase shifts are now
accurately known, causality and unitarity determine the decay amplitude within
small uncertainties -- except for the values of the subtraction constants. Our
determination of these constants relies on the Dalitz plot distribution of the
charged channel, which is now measured with good accuracy. The theoretical
constraints that follow from the fact that the particles involved in the
transition represent Nambu-Goldstone bosons of a hidden approximate symmetry
play an equally important role. The ensuing predictions for the Dalitz plot
distribution of the neutral channel and for the branching ratio
$\Gamma_{\eta\to3\pi^0}/ \Gamma_{\eta\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0}$ are in very good
agreement with experiment. Relying on a known low-energy theorem that relates
the meson masses to the masses of the three lightest quarks, our analysis leads
to $Q=22.1(7)$, where the error covers all of the uncertainties encountered in
the course of the calculation: experimental uncertainties in decay rates and
Dalitz plot distributions, noise in the input used for the phase shifts, as
well as theoretical uncertainties in the constraints imposed by chiral symmetry

smallest rate at which entanglement is required, in addition to free classical

most general discriminator cannot distinguish the $n$ calls to $\mathcal{N}$
from the simulation. The most general discriminator is one who tests the
channels in a sequential manner, one after the other, and this discriminator is
known as a quantum tester [Chiribella et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 101, 060401
(2008)] or one who is implementing a quantum co-strategy [Gutoski et al., Symp.
Th. Comp., 565 (2007)]. As such, the proposed revised definition of
entanglement cost of a quantum channel leads to a rate that cannot be smaller
than the previous notion of a channel's entanglement cost [Berta et al., IEEE
Trans. Inf. Theory, 59, 6779 (2013)], in which the discriminator is limited to
distinguishing parallel uses of the channel from the simulation. Under this
revised notion, I prove that the entanglement cost of certain
teleportation-simulable channels is equal to the entanglement cost of their
underlying resource states. Then I find single-letter formulas for the
entanglement cost of some fundamental channel models, including dephasing,
erasure, three-dimensional Werner--Holevo channels, epolarizing channels
(complements of depolarizing channels), as well as single-mode pure-loss and
pure-amplifier bosonic Gaussian channels. These examples demonstrate that the
resource theory of entanglement for quantum channels is not reversible.
Finally, I discuss how to generalize the basic notions to arbitrary resource
theories.

show that the kernels split naturally into angular and radial parts and we show
explicitly how the radial extent of these kernels depends on the targeted

produce E/B-like maps, provided it vanishes at the origin and the antipodal
point. These maps are simply filtered versions of the standard E/B maps. We
argue that it is possible compute E/B maps in real space with a

mass loss shed during phases of instability. Key for assigning these stars a
proper evolutionary state is to assess the composition and geometry of their
ejecta alongside the stellar properties. We selected five hot LBV candidates in
M33 to refine their classification, investigate their circumstellar
environments and explore their evolutionary properties. Being accessible
targets in the near-infrared, we conducted medium-resolution spectroscopy with
GNIRS/GEMINI in the $K-$band to investigate their molecular circumstellar
environments. Two stars were found to display CO emission, which was modeled to
emerge from a circumstellar or circumbinary Keplerian disk/ring. The
identification of the carbon isotope $^{13}$C and, for one of the two stars, a
significantly low $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratio, implies an evolved stellar state.
As both CO emission stars are highly luminous and hence do not undergo a red
supergiant phase, we suggest that stripping processes and equatorial
high-density ejecta due to fast rotation are responsible for the enrichment of
the stellar surface with processed material from the core. A candidate B[e]SG
displays an absorption CO profile, which may be attributed to a jet or stellar

For the observed ALMA data we compare our estimates with values obtained from a
maximum-likelihood lens modeling method which operates in the visibility space

parameters with high accuracy using a combination of an RNN structure
performing image deconvolution and a CNN performing lensing analysis, with
uncertainties less than a factor of two higher than those achieved with
maximum-likelihood methods. Including the deconvolution procedure performed by
RIM, a single evaluation can be done in about a second on a single GPU,
providing a more than six orders of magnitude increase in analysis speed while
using about eight orders of magnitude less computational resources compared to
maximum-likelihood lens modeling in the uv-plane. We conclude that this is a
promising method for the analysis of mm and cm interferometric data from

XMM-Newton constrains the ionised absorption in the source. The pure reflection
model requires a black hole of high spin ($a>0.92$) viewed at a moderate

requires extreme parameters: the cut-off of the primary continuum is very low

graph (DAG) task systems have received much recent attention. The DAG model can
accurately represent intra-task parallelim and precedence constraints existing
in many application domains. Existing techniques show that analyzing the DAG
model is fundamentally more challenging compared to the ordinary sporadic task
model, due to the complex intra-DAG precedence constraints which may cause
rather pessimistic schedulability loss. However,such increased loss is
counter-intuitive because the DAG structure shall better exploit the
parallelism provided by the multiprocessor platform. Our observation is that
the intra-DAG precedence constraints, if not carefully considered by the
scheduling algorithm, may cause very unpredictable execution behaviors of
subtasks in a DAG and further cause pessimistic analysis. In this paper, we
present a set of novel scheduling and analysis techniques for better supporting
hard real-time sporadic DAG tasks on multiprocessors, through smartly defining
and analyzing the execution order of subtasks in each DAG. Evaluation
demonstrates that our developed utilization-based schedulability test is highly
efficient, which dramatically improves schedulability of existing
utilization-based tests by over 60% on average. Interestingly, when each DAG in
the system is an ordinary sporadic task, our test becomes identical to the
classical density test designed for the sporadic task model.

the set of available unitary transformations is restricted to $SO(3)$, realized

only on the eigenvalues, but also on the eigenstates of the mixed state under
scrutiny. The overlap distribution then shows a complicated pattern, which may
be considered as a fingerprint of the mixed state. When using random
transformations from the unitary group, the eigenvalues can be determined quite
simply from the lower and the upper limit of the overlap statistics. This may
still be possible in the $SO(3)$ case, but only at the expense of a finite

  Machine Learning",,,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The nascent field of fair machine learning aims to ensure that decisions
guided by algorithms are equitable. Over the last several years, three formal
definitions of fairness have gained prominence: (1) anti-classification,
meaning that protected attributes---like race, gender, and their proxies---are
not explicitly used to make decisions; (2) classification parity, meaning that
common measures of predictive performance (e.g., false positive and false
negative rates) are equal across groups defined by the protected attributes;
and (3) calibration, meaning that conditional on risk estimates, outcomes are
independent of protected attributes. Here we show that all three of these
fairness definitions suffer from significant statistical limitations. Requiring
anti-classification or classification parity can, perversely, harm the very
groups they were designed to protect; and calibration, though generally
desirable, provides little guarantee that decisions are equitable. In contrast
to these formal fairness criteria, we argue that it is often preferable to
treat similarly risky people similarly, based on the most statistically
accurate estimates of risk that one can produce. Such a strategy, while not
universally applicable, often aligns well with policy objectives; notably, this
strategy will typically violate both anti-classification and classification
parity. In practice, it requires significant effort to construct suitable risk
estimates. One must carefully define and measure the targets of prediction to
avoid retrenching biases in the data. But, importantly, one cannot generally
address these difficulties by requiring that algorithms satisfy popular
mathematical formalizations of fairness. By highlighting these challenges in
the foundation of fair machine learning, we hope to help researchers and
practitioners productively advance the area.

the training process of incompleteness repair. The solution algorithms are

applications and to measure the amount of Kotlin code inside Android
applications. Secondly, it aims to measure the quality of Android applications
that are written using Kotlin and to compare it with the quality of Android

Kotlin applications from a dataset of open-source Android applications. Then,
we analyzed those applications to detect instances of code smells and computed
an estimation of quality of the applications. Finally, we studied how the
introduction of Kotlin code impacts on the quality of an Android application.
Results: Our experiment found that 11.26% of applications from a dataset with

predicted to lie in the galactic disk. Their radii increase on cosmological
time scales at a rate of order $1$ kpc/Gyr. When a caustic ring passes through
the orbit of a star, the orbit is strongly perturbed. We find that a star
moving in a nearly circular orbit is first attracted towards the caustic ring,
then moves with and oscillates about the caustic for approximately $1$ Gyr
before returning to its original orbit. As a result, a stellar overdensity
forms around the caustic ring. We predict such overdensities to be of order
$120\%$ near the 2nd caustic ring where the Monoceros Ring is observed and of
order $45$, $30$ and $15\%$ near the 3rd, 4th and 5th caustic rings,
respectively. We show that the associated bulk velocities of the stars near the
caustic rings are less than a few km/s. We also determine the density profile
of interstellar gas near the 5th caustic ring assuming it is in thermal
equilibrium in the gravitational potential of the caustic and of the gas

planning is challenging due to the combination of terrain roughness and severe

terrains requires repeated safety checks on all the candidate paths at a small
interval. Predicting the future rover state requires simulating the vehicle
settling on the terrain, which involves an inverse-kinematics problem with
iterative nonlinear optimization under geometric constraints. However, such
expensive computation is intractable for slow spacecraft computers, such as
RAD750, which is used by the Curiosity Mars rover and upcoming Mars 2020 rover.
We propose the Approximate Clearance Evaluation (ACE) algorithm, which obtains
conservative bounds on vehicle clearance, attitude, and suspension angles
without iterative computation. It obtains those bounds by estimating the lowest
and highest heights that each wheel may reach given the underlying terrain, and
calculating the worst-case vehicle configuration associated with those extreme
wheel heights. The bounds are guaranteed to be conservative, hence ensuring
vehicle safety during autonomous navigation. ACE is planned to be used as part
of the new onboard path planner of the Mars 2020 rover. This paper describes
the algorithm in detail and validates our claim of conservatism and fast

are $n$ agents and each agent strategically chooses when to join a
first-come-first-served observable queue. Agents dislike standing in line and
they take actions in discrete time steps: we assume that each agent has a cost
of $1$ for every time step he waits before joining the queue and a cost of
$w>1$ for every time step he waits in the queue. At each time step a single
agent can be processed. Before each time step, every agent observes the queue
and strategically decides whether or not to join, with the goal of minimizing
his expected cost.
  In this paper we focus on symmetric strategies which are arguably more
natural as they require less coordination. This brings up the following twist
to the usual price of anarchy question: what is the main source for the
inefficiency of symmetric equilibria? is it the players' strategic behavior or
the lack of coordination?
  We present results for two different parameter regimes that are qualitatively
very different: (i) when $w$ is fixed and $n$ grows, we prove a tight bound of
$2$ and show that the entire loss is due to the players' selfish behavior (ii)
when $n$ is fixed and $w$ grows, we prove a tight bound of $\Theta
\left(\sqrt{\frac{w}{n}}\right)$ and show that it is mainly due to lack of
coordination: the same order of magnitude of loss is suffered by any symmetric
profile.

propose a direct latent fingerprint reconstruction model based on conditional
generative adversarial networks (cGANs). Two modifications are applied to the
cGAN to adapt it for the task of latent fingerprint reconstruction. First, the
model is forced to generate three additional maps to the ridge map to ensure
that the orientation and frequency information is considered in the generation
process, and prevent the model from filling large missing areas and generating
erroneous minutiae. Second, a perceptual ID preservation approach is developed
to force the generator to preserve the ID information during the reconstruction
process. Using a synthetically generated database of latent fingerprints, the
deep network learns to predict missing information from the input latent
samples. We evaluate the proposed method in combination with two different
fingerprint matching algorithms on several publicly available latent
fingerprint datasets. We achieved the rank-10 accuracy of 88.02\% on the
IIIT-Delhi latent fingerprint database for the task of latent-to-latent
matching and rank-50 accuracy of 70.89\% on the IIIT-Delhi MOLF database for
the task of latent-to-sensor matching. Experimental results of matching
reconstructed samples in both latent-to-sensor and latent-to-latent frameworks

statistically model the patterns of correlation across different brain regions

Gaussian process in a Bayesian mixed-effects model and makes use of Kronecker
algebra and a low-rank approximation to scale efficiently to multi-way
neuroimaging data at the whole brain level. On a publicly available clinical

of both deep learning and analytical acoustic modelling (filtering based
approach) as compared to recently published, comparatively simpler benchmark
approaches that rely only on deep learning. The proposed audio-visual (AV)
speech enhancement framework operates at two levels. In the first level, a
novel deep learning-based lip-reading regression model is employed. In the
second level, lip-reading approximated clean-audio features are exploited,
using an enhanced, visually-derived Wiener filter (EVWF), for the clean audio
power spectrum estimation. Specifically, a stacked long-short-term memory
(LSTM) based lip-reading regression model is designed for clean audio features
estimation using only temporal visual features considering different number of
prior visual frames. For clean speech spectrum estimation, a new
filterbank-domain EVWF is formulated, which exploits estimated speech features.
The proposed EVWF is compared with conventional Spectral Subtraction and
Log-Minimum Mean-Square Error methods using both ideal AV mapping and LSTM
driven AV mapping. The potential of the proposed speech enhancement framework
is evaluated under different dynamic real-world commercially-motivated
scenarios (e.g. cafe, public transport, pedestrian area) at different SNR
levels (ranging from low to high SNRs) using benchmark Grid and ChiME3 corpora.
For objective testing, perceptual evaluation of speech quality is used to
evaluate the quality of restored speech. For subjective testing, the standard
mean-opinion-score method is used with inferential statistics. Comparative
simulation results demonstrate significant lip-reading and speech enhancement
improvement in terms of both speech quality and speech intelligibility.

used for describing the gravitational field of the two non-Newtonian primaries.
The orbital properties of the test particle are determined through the
classification of the initial conditions of the orbits, using several values of
the Jacobi constant, in the Hill's regions of possible motion. The initial
conditions are classified into three main categories: (i) bounded, (ii)
escaping and (iii) displaying close encounters. Using the smaller alignment

aerial vehicles (UAVs) without command and communication from the ground
station has become more imperative, in particular in search-and-rescue
operations, disaster management, and other applications where human
intervention is limited. In such scenarios, UAVs can make more efficient
decisions if they acquire more information about the mobility, sensing and
actuation capabilities of their neighbor nodes. In this paper, we develop an
unsupervised online learning algorithm for joint mobility prediction and object
profiling of UAVs to facilitate control and communication protocols. The
proposed method not only predicts the future locations of the surrounding
flying objects, but also classifies them into different groups with similar
levels of maneuverability (e.g. rotatory, and fixed-wing UAVs) without prior
knowledge about these classes. This method is flexible in admitting new object
types with unknown mobility profiles, thereby applicable to emerging flying
Ad-hoc networks with heterogeneous nodes.

matching sketch image against a gallery of mugshots. Face sketches have the
essential in- formation about the spatial topology and geometric details of
faces while missing some important facial attributes such as ethnicity, hair,
eye, and skin color. We propose a cou- pled deep neural network architecture
which utilizes facial attributes in order to improve the sketch-photo
recognition performance. The proposed Attribute-Assisted Deep Con- volutional
Neural Network (AADCNN) method exploits the facial attributes and leverages the
loss functions from the facial attributes identification and face verification
tasks in order to learn rich discriminative features in a common em- bedding
subspace. The facial attribute identification task increases the inter-personal
variations by pushing apart the embedded features extracted from individuals
with differ- ent facial attributes, while the verification task reduces the
intra-personal variations by pulling together all the fea- tures that are
related to one person. The learned discrim- inative features can be well
generalized to new identities not seen in the training data. The proposed
architecture is able to make full use of the sketch and complementary fa- cial
attribute information to train a deep model compared to the conventional
sketch-photo recognition methods. Exten- sive experiments are performed on
composite (E-PRIP) and semi-forensic (IIIT-D semi-forensic) datasets. The
results show the superiority of our method compared to the state- of-the-art

winds which slow the stellar rotation during their main sequence lifetimes.
Magnetic variability is commonly observed in Sun-like stars, and the changing
strength and topology of the global field is expected to affect the torque
exerted by the stellar wind. We present three different methods for computing
the angular momentum loss in the solar wind. Two are based on MHD simulations
from Finley & Matt (2018), with one using the open flux measured in the solar
wind, and the other using remotely-observed surface magnetograms. Both methods
agree in the variation of the solar torque seen through the solar cycle and
show a 30-40% decrease from cycle 23 to 24. The two methods calculate different
average values, $2.9\times10^{30}$erg (open flux) and $0.35\times10^{30}$erg
(surface field). This discrepancy results from the already well-known
difficulty with reconciling the magnetograms with observed open flux, which is
currently not understood, leading to an inability to discriminate between these
two calculated torques. The third method is based on the observed spin-rates of
Sun-like stars, which decrease with age, directly probing the average angular
momentum loss. This method gives $6.2\times10^{30}$erg for the solar torque,
larger than the other methods. This may be indicative of further variability in
the solar torque on timescales much longer than the magnetic cycle. We discuss
the implications for applying the formula to other Sun-like stars, where only
surface field measurements are available, and where the magnetic variations are
ill-constrained.

memory and storage, including the abstractions that manage this boundary.
Researchers comparing the speed, durability, and abstractions of hybrid systems
with DRAM, NVM, and disk to traditional systems typically use simulation, which
makes it easy to evaluate different hardware technologies and parameters.
Unfortunately, simulation is extremely slow, limiting the number of
applications and dataset sizes in the evaluation. Simulation typically
precludes realistic multiprogram workloads and considering runtime and
operating system design alternatives. Good methodology embraces a variety of
techniques for validation, expanding the experimental scope, and uncovering new
insights. This paper introduces an emulation platform for hybrid memory that
uses commodity NUMA servers. Emulation complements simulation well, offering
speed and accuracy for realistic workloads, and richer software
experimentation. We use a thread-local socket to emulate DRAM and the remote
socket to emulate NVM. We use standard C library routines to allocate heap
memory in the DRAM or NVM socket for use with explicit memory management or
garbage collection. We evaluate the emulator using various configurations of
write-rationing garbage collectors that improve NVM lifetimes by limiting
writes to NVM, and use 15 applications from three benchmark suites with various
datasets and workload configurations. We show emulation enhances simulation
results. The two systems confirm most trends, such as NVM write and read rates
of different software configurations, increasing our confidence for predicting
future system effects. Emulation adds novel insights, such as the non-linear
effects of multi-program workloads on write rates.

period, and then it starts to change so that the complexity growth rate
violates the Lloyd's bound at initial times, and approaches this bound from
above at later times. Compared with isotropic systems at the same temperature,
the anisotropy reduces the initial period in which the complexity is constant
and increases the rate of change of complexity. At late times the difference
between the isotropic and anisotropic results is proportional to the pressure
difference in the transverse and longitudinal directions.

carries out attribute reduction, thereby selecting the most informative

have employed the fuzzy-rough dependency degree (FRFDD) in the lower

effectiveness in feature selection. As for the search strategy, a new version
of a binary shuffled frog leaping algorithm is proposed (B-SFLA). The new
feature selection method is obtained by hybridizing the B-SFLA with the FRDD.
Non-parametric statistical tests are conducted to compare the proposed approach
with several existing methods over twenty two datasets, including nine high

demonstrate that the B-SFLA approach significantly outperforms other

the architecture to provide additional information in such extreme cold-start

merged in an hybrid recommendation approach. A temporal offline evaluation
method is also proposed as a complementary contribution, for a more realistic
evaluation of such task, considering dynamic factors that affect global
readership interests like popularity, recency, and seasonality. Experiments

image/video databases. Unfortunately, the GPU memory is physically finite,
which limits the image resolutions and batch sizes that could be used in
training for better DNN performance. Unlike solutions that require physically
upgrade GPUs, the Gradient CheckPointing(GCP) training trades computation for
more memory beyond existing GPU hardware. GCP only stores a subset of
intermediate tensors, called Gradient Checkpoints (GCs), during forward. Then
during backward, extra local forwards are conducted to compute the missing
tensors. The total training memory cost becomes the sum of (1) the memory cost
of the gradient checkpoints and (2) the maximum memory cost of local forwards.
To achieve maximal memory cut-offs, one needs optimal algorithms to select GCs.
Existing GCP approaches rely on either manual input of GCs or heuristics-based
GC search on Linear Computation Graphs (LCGs), and cannot apply to Arbitrary
Computation Graphs(ACGs). In this paper, we present theories and optimal
algorithms on GC selection that, for the first time, are applicable to ACGs and
achieve the maximal memory cut-offs. Extensive experiments show that our

VGG, ResNet, Densenet, Inception Net and highly complicated DNNs by Network

placed stringent bounds on a broad class of theories beyond general relativity.
Current and future radio telescopes, such as FAST, SKA, and MeerKAT, may find a
new astrophysical system, a pulsar orbiting around a black hole, which will
provide us a new source for probing gravity. In this paper, we systematically
study the prospects of testing general relativity with such black hole-pulsar
binaries. We begin by finding a mapping between generic non-Einsteinian
parameters in the orbital decay rate and theoretical constants in various
modified theories of gravity and then summarize this mapping with a
ready-to-use list. Theories we study here include scalar-tensor theories,
varying $G$ theories, massive gravity theories, generic screening gravity and
quadratic curvature-corrected theories. We next use simulated measurement
accuracy of the orbital decay rate with FAST/SKA to derive projected upper
bounds on the generic non-Einsteinian parameters. We find that such bounds from
black hole-pulsars can be stronger than those from neutron star-pulsar and
neutron star-white dwarf binaries by a few orders of magnitude when the
correction enters at negative post-Newtonian orders. By mapping such bounds on
generic parameters to those on various modified theories of gravity, we find
that one can constrain the time variation in Newton's constant $G$ to be
comparable and complementary to the current strongest bound from solar system
experiments. We also study how well one can probe quadratic gravity from black
hole quadrupole moment measurements of black hole-pulsars. We find that bounds
on the parity-violating sector of quadratic gravity can be stronger than
current bounds by six orders of magnitude. These results suggest that a new
discovery of black hole-pulsars in the future will provide powerful ways to
probe gravity further.

frequencies and its physical mechanism must be understood to develop effective
aircraft noise reduction strategies. A hybrid semi-empirical prediction model
has recently been developed based on the instability-wave-scattering mechanism.
However, its validity and accuracy remain to be tested. To do so, in this paper
we carry out a systematic installed jet-noise experiment in the laboratory
using a flat plate instead of an aircraft wing. We show that reducing $H$ (the
separation distance between the flat plate and jet centreline) causes stronger
low-frequency noise enhancement while resulting in little change to the noise
shielding and enhancement at high frequencies. Decreasing $L$ (the axial
distance between the jet exit plane and the trailing edge of the plate) results
in reduced noise amplification at low frequencies and also weakens both the
shielding and enhancement at high frequencies. Increasing the jet Mach number
abates the installation effects. It is shown that the hybrid model developed in
the earlier work agrees with experimental measurements and can capture the
effects of varying $H$, $L$ and jet Mach number extremely well. It is concluded
that the model captures the correct physics and can serve as an accurate and
robust prediction tool. This new physical understanding provides insights into
innovative strategies for suppressing installed jet noise.

an ethical behavior is to avoid (intended, perceived, or accidental) bias. Bias
occurs when the data distribution is not representative enough of the natural

a service is hard to detect and handle if the AI service is merely being used

generates bias ratings signifying whether the AI service is unbiased

product of a vector of data and the corresponding weights in a conventional
neuron is replaced with a quadratic function. The resultant quadratic neuron
enjoys an enhanced expressive capability over the conventional neuron. However,
how quadratic neurons improve the expressing capability of a deep quadratic
network has not been studied up to now, preferably in relation to that of a
conventional neural network. Regarding this, we ask four basic questions in
this paper: (1) for the one-hidden-layer network structure, is there any
function that a quadratic network can approximate much more efficiently than a
conventional network? (2) for the same multi-layer network structure, is there
any function that can be expressed by a quadratic network but cannot be
expressed with conventional neurons in the same structure? (3) Does a quadratic
network give a new insight into universal approximation? (4) To approximate the
same class of functions with the same error bound, is a quantized quadratic
network able to enjoy a lower number of weights than a quantized conventional
network? Our main contributions are the four interconnected theorems shedding
light upon these four questions and demonstrating the merits of a quadratic
network in terms of expressive efficiency, unique capability, compact

are confined to the lower helicity band. A previous study has investigated the
conductivity in this regime using a treatment in the first Born approximation.
In this work, we use the full T-matrix to uncover new features of the
conductivity. We first compute the conductivity within a semiclassical
Boltzmann framework and show that it exhibits an unconventional density
dependence due to the unusual features of the group velocity in the single
particle dispersion, as well as quantized plateaus as a function of the
logarithm of the electron density. We support this with a calculation using the
Kubo formula and find that these plateaus persist in the full quantum theory.
We suggest that this quantization may be seen in a pump-probe experiment.

multispectral images obtained from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using a
deep neural network (DNN). Most studies on crop/weed semantic segmentation only
consider single images for processing and classification. Images taken by UAVs
often cover only a few hundred square meters with either color only or color
and near-infrared (NIR) channels. Computing a single large and accurate
vegetation map (e.g., crop/weed) using a DNN is non-trivial due to difficulties
arising from: (1) limited ground sample distances (GSDs) in high-altitude
datasets, (2) sacrificed resolution resulting from downsampling high-fidelity
images, and (3) multispectral image alignment. To address these issues, we
adopt a stand sliding window approach that operates on only small portions of
multispectral orthomosaic maps (tiles), which are channel-wise aligned and
calibrated radiometrically across the entire map. We define the tile size to be
the same as that of the DNN input to avoid resolution loss. Compared to our

multicarrier solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication systems.
In particular, the UAV is powered by solar energy enabling sustainable
communication services to multiple ground users. We study the joint design of
the three-dimensional (3D) aerial trajectory and the wireless resource
allocation for maximization of the system sum throughput over a given time
period. As a performance benchmark, we first consider an offline resource
allocation design assuming non-causal knowledge of the channel gains. The
algorithm design is formulated as a mixed-integer non-convex optimization
problem taking into account the aerodynamic power consumption, solar energy
harvesting, a finite energy storage capacity, and the quality-of-service (QoS)
requirements of the users. Despite the non-convexity of the optimization
problem, we solve it optimally by applying monotonic optimization to obtain the
optimal 3D-trajectory and the optimal power and subcarrier allocation policy.
Subsequently, we focus on online algorithm design which only requires real-time
and statistical knowledge of the channel gains. The optimal online resource
allocation algorithm is motivated by the offline scheme and entails a high
computational complexity. Hence, we also propose a low-complexity iterative
suboptimal online scheme based on successive convex approximation. Our results
unveil the tradeoff between solar energy harvesting and power-efficient
communication. In particular, the solar-powered UAV first climbs up to a high
altitude to harvest a sufficient amount of solar energy and then descents again
to a lower altitude to reduce the path loss of the communication links to the
users it serves.

Ontology-based recommender systems exploit hierarchical organizations of users

ontology-based approaches address the shortcomings of their collaborative
filtering counterparts, ontological organizations of items can be difficult to
obtain for items that mostly belong to the same category (e.g., television

Bragg coherent modulation imaging (BCMI), which uses a modulator to solve the

Because a known modulator is essential to the technique, we first demonstrate
experimentally that an unknown modulator structure can be recovered by using
the exit wave diversity that exists in a standard Bragg coherent diffraction

used to directly load and unload memory segments. Newer CUDA programs have
started taking advantage of UVM for the same reasons of superior
programmability that UNIX applications long ago switched to assuming the
presence of virtual memory. Therefore, checkpointing of UVM will become
increasingly important, especially as NVIDIA CUDA continues to gain wider
popularity: 87 of the top 500 supercomputers in the latest listings are
GPU-accelerated, with a current trend of ten additional GPU-based
supercomputers each year.
  A new scalable checkpointing mechanism, CRUM (Checkpoint-Restart for Unified
Memory), is demonstrated for hybrid CUDA/MPI computations across multiple
computer nodes. CRUM supports a fast, forked checkpointing, which mostly
overlaps the CUDA computation with storage of the checkpoint image in stable
storage. The runtime overhead of using CRUM is 6% on average, and the time for
forked checkpointing is seen to be a factor of up to 40 times less than
traditional, synchronous checkpointing.

risks in distributed computing protocols against local or global dynamics
eavesdroppers, and proposed a Privacy-Preserving-Summation-Consistent (PPSC)
mechanism as a generic privacy encryption subroutine for consensus-based
distributed computations. In this part of this paper, we show that the
conventional deterministic and random gossip algorithms can be used to realize
the PPSC mechanism over a given network. At each time step, a node is selected
to interact with one of its neighbors via deterministic or random gossiping.
Such node generates a random number as its new state, and sends the subtraction
between its current state and that random number to the neighbor; then the
neighbor updates its state by adding the received value to its current state.
We establish concrete privacy-preservation conditions by proving the
impossibility for the reconstruction of the network input from the output of
the gossip-based PPSC mechanism against eavesdroppers with full network
knowledge, and by showing that the PPSC mechanism can achieve differential
privacy at arbitrary privacy levels. The convergence is characterized
explicitly and analytically for both deterministic and randomized gossiping,
which is essentially achieved in a finite number of steps. Additionally, we
illustrate that the proposed algorithms can be easily made adaptive in
real-world applications by making realtime trade-offs between resilience
against node dropout or communication failure and privacy preservation
capabilities.

(pCT) image reconstruction. The assumption of straight paths is replaced with
Bayesian models of the most likely path (MLP). Current MLP-based pCT
reconstruction approaches assume a water scattering environment. We propose an
MLP formalism based on accurate determination of scattering moments in
inhomogeneous media. Methods: Scattering power relative to water (RScP) was
calculated for a range of human tissues and investigated against relative
stopping power (RStP). Monte Carlo simulation was used to compare the new
inhomogeneous MLP formalism to the water approach in a slab geometry and a
human head phantom. An MLP-Spline-Hybrid method was investigated for improved
computational efficiency. Results: A piecewise-linear correlation between RStP
and RScP was shown, which may assist in iterative pCT reconstruction. The
inhomogeneous formalism predicted Monte Carlo proton paths through a water cube
with thick bone inserts to within 1.0 mm for beams ranging from 210 to 230 MeV
incident energy. Improvement in accuracy over the conventional MLP ranged from
5% for a 230 MeV beam to 17% for 210 MeV. There was no noticeable gain in
accuracy when predicting 200 MeV proton paths through a clinically relevant
human head phantom. The MLP-Spline-Hybrid method reduced computation time by
half while suffering negligible loss of accuracy. Conclusions: We have
presented an MLP formalism that accounts for material composition. In most
clinical cases a water scattering environment can be assumed, however in
certain cases of significant heterogeneity the proposed algorithm may improve
proton path estimation.

such maliciously crafted samples trigger DNNs to misbehave, leading to
detrimental consequences for DNN-powered systems. The fundamental challenges of
mitigating adversarial inputs stem from their adaptive and variable nature.
Existing solutions attempt to improve DNN resilience against specific attacks;
yet, such static defenses can often be circumvented by adaptively engineered
inputs or by new attack variants.
  Here, we present EagleEye, an attack-agnostic adversarial tampering analysis
engine for DNN-powered systems. Our design exploits the {\em minimality
principle} underlying many attacks: to maximize the attack's evasiveness, the
adversary often seeks the minimum possible distortion to convert genuine inputs
to adversarial ones. We show that this practice entails the distinct
distributional properties of adversarial inputs in the input space. By
leveraging such properties in a principled manner, EagleEye effectively
discriminates adversarial inputs and even uncovers their correct classification
outputs. Through extensive empirical evaluation using a range of benchmark
datasets and DNN models, we validate EagleEye's efficacy. We further
investigate the adversary's possible countermeasures, which implies a difficult
dilemma for her: to evade EagleEye's detection, excessive distortion is
necessary, thereby significantly reducing the attack's evasiveness regarding
other detection mechanisms.

specially designed to accommodate minor behavior variations that existing

approaches to efficiently identify the user based on his or her

our prototype system achieves 0.1% and 0.5% best Equal Error Rate (EER) for

non-universal, while the wall density at the Ising transition remains
universal, i.e. in agreement with the Ising model. An important part of this
study is the numerical measurement of defect-defect correlators. We find that

solute transport in aquifers or water flow in heterogeneous porous media. In
this model, the time and space Hausdorff derivatives are defined on
non-Euclidean fractal metrics with power law scaling transform which,
respectively, connect the temporal and spatial complexity during transport. The
Hausdorff derivative model can be transformed to an advection-dispersion
equation with time- and space-dependent dispersion and convection coefficients.
This model is a fractal partial differential equation (PDE) defined on a
fractal space and differs from the fractional PDE which is derived for
non-local transport of particles on a non-fractal Euclidean space. As an
example of applications of this model, an explicit solution with a constant
diffusion coefficient and flow velocity subject to an instantaneous source is
derived and fitted to the breakthrough curves of tritium as a tracer in porous
media. These results are compared with those of a scale-dependent dispersion
model and a time-scale dependent dispersion model. Overall, it is found that
the fractal PDE based on the Hausdorff derivatives better captures the early
arrival and heavy tail in the scaled breakthrough curves for variable transport
distances. The estimated parameters in the fractal Hausrdorff model represent
clear physical mechanisms such as linear relationships between the orders of
Hausdorff derivatives and the transport distance. The mathematical formulation
is applicable to both solute transport and water flow in porous media.

classification accuracy, however, there is no guarantee that synthetic visual
representations can generate back their semantic feature in a multi-modal
cycle-consistent manner. This constraint can result in synthetic visual
representations that do not represent well their semantic features. In this
paper, we propose the use of such constraint based on a new regularization for
the GAN training that forces the generated visual features to reconstruct their
original semantic features. Once our model is trained with this multi-modal
cycle-consistent semantic compatibility, we can then synthesize more
representative visual representations for the seen and, more importantly, for
the unseen classes. Our proposed approach shows the best GZSL classification
results in the field in several publicly available datasets.

side-effect caused by the power supply used to drive the luminaires. For LED
luminaires powered by a switched mode power supply, the SEM can be at much
higher frequencies than that emitted by conventional incandescent or
fluorescent lighting. It has been shown that the SEM caused by commercially
available LED luminaires is often periodic and of low power. In this paper, we
investigate the impact of typical forms of SEM on the performance of optical
OFDM VLC systems; both ACO-OFDM and DCO-OFDM are considered. Our results show
that even low levels of SEM power can significantly degrade the bit-error-rate
performance. To solve this problem, an SEM mitigation scheme is described. The
mitigation scheme is decision-directed and is based on estimating and
subtracting the fundamental component of the SEM from the received signal. We
describe two forms of the algorithm; one uses blind estimation while the other
uses pilot-assisted estimation based on a training sequence. Decision errors,
resulting in decision noise, limit the performance of the blind estimator even
when estimation is based on very long signals. However, the pilot system can
achieve more accurate estimations, thus better performance. Results are first
presented for typical SEM waveforms for the case where the fundamental
frequency of the SEM is known. The algorithms are then extended to include a

technical difficulty in parsing multiple instances in a single pass. Several
related works all follow the ""parsing-by-detection"" pipeline that heavily
relies on separately trained detection models to localize instances and then
performs human parsing for each instance sequentially. Nonetheless, two
discrepant optimization targets of detection and parsing lead to suboptimal
representation learning and error accumulation for final results. In this work,
we make the first attempt to explore a detection-free Part Grouping Network
(PGN) for efficiently parsing multiple people in an image in a single pass. Our
PGN reformulates instance-level human parsing as two twinned sub-tasks that can
be jointly learned and mutually refined via a unified network: 1) semantic part
segmentation for assigning each pixel as a human part (e.g., face, arms); 2)
instance-aware edge detection to group semantic parts into distinct person
instances. Thus the shared intermediate representation would be endowed with
capabilities in both characterizing fine-grained parts and inferring instance
belongings of each part. Finally, a simple instance partition process is
employed to get final results during inference. We conducted experiments on

the relation between data utility and privacy risk in large-scale behavioral
data, focusing on mobile phone metadata as paradigmatic domain. To measure
utility, we survey experts about the value of mobile phone metadata at various
spatial and temporal granularity levels. To measure privacy, we propose a
formal and intuitive measure of reidentification risk$\unicode{x2014}$the
information ratio$\unicode{x2014}$and compute it at each granularity level. Our
results confirm the existence of a stark tradeoff between data utility and
reidentifiability, where the most valuable datasets are also most prone to
reidentification. When data is specified at ZIP-code and hourly levels, outside
knowledge of only 7% of a person's data suffices for reidentification and
retrieval of the remaining 93%. In contrast, in the least valuable dataset,
specified at municipality and daily levels, reidentification requires on
average outside knowledge of 51%, or 31 data points, of a person's data to
retrieve the remaining 49%. Overall, our findings show that coarsening data
directly erodes its value, and highlight the need for using data-coarsening,
not as stand-alone mechanism, but in combination with data-sharing models that
provide adjustable degrees of accountability and security.

to changes of states or parameters and (ii) coexistence of seemingly

inherently decentralized nature of the dynamics. They include effects as
diverse as negative compressibility in engineered materials, rescue
interactions in biological networks, negative resistance in fluid networks, and
the Braess paradox occurring across transport and supply networks. They also
include remote synchronization, chimera states and the converse of symmetry
breaking in brain, power-grid and oscillator networks as well as remote control

extracts sparse and front-loaded impulse responses from the channel outputs,
i.e., their convolutions with a single arbitrary source. A crucial feature of
this formulation is that it doesn't encode support restrictions on the
unknowns, unlike most prior work on BD. The indeterminacy inherent to BD, which
is difficult to resolve with a traditional L1 penalty on the impulse responses,
is resolved in our method because it seeks a first approximation where the
impulse responses are: ""maximally white"" -- encoded as the energy focusing near
zero lag of the impulse-response auto-correlations; and ""maximally
front-loaded"" -- encoded as the energy focusing near zero time of the impulse
responses. Hence we call the method focused blind deconvolution (FBD). The
focusing constraints are relaxed as the iterations progress. Note that FBD
requires the duration of the channel outputs to be longer than that of the
unknown impulse responses.
  A multichannel blind deconvolution problem that is appropriately formulated
by sparse and front-loaded impulse responses arises in seismic inversion, where
the impulse responses are the Green's function evaluations at different
receiver locations, and the operation of a drill bit inputs the noisy and
correlated source signature into the subsurface. We demonstrate the benefits of
FBD using seismic-while-drilling numerical experiments, where the noisy data
recorded at the receivers are hard to interpret, but FBD can provide the
processing essential to separate the drill-bit (source) signature from the
interpretable Green's function.

phosphide were studied and two types of carbon and phosphorous vacancies

have the lowest formation energy, while phosphorous divacancies have the
highest one in both CP allotropes. A strong mechanical anisotropy for carbon
phosphide was found with the Young\'s modulus and the failure stress along ZZ
direction being an order of magnitude larger than those along AC direction. In
both allotropes, the Youngs modulus, failure stress and strain are considerably
affected by vacancies, especially along AC direction. Fracture of pristine CP
monolayer occurred via the rupture of phosphorous-phosphorous bonds when CP
monolayer is stretched along AC direction, while via the rupture of
carbon-phosphorous bonds when stretched along ZZ direction. The failure strain
and stress along the AC direction are affected only by phosphorous vacancies,
while along the ZZ direction, they are almost equally affected by both
phosphorous and carbon vacancies. These understandings may provide useful
guidelines for potential applications of CP monolayers in nanoelectromechanical

All compounds in the family crystallize in the monoclinic structure and the
monoclinic distortion enhances with decreasing trivalent rare earth radii. The
magnetic ordering temperature, Tc, decreases from 270 K for La to 80 K for Ho
samples as the rare earth radii decrease from 0.116nm for La to 0.102nm in case
of Ho. An additional anomaly is observed in samples containing Nd, Sm, Tb, and
Dy at lower temperatures, which originates from the 3d to 4f coupling between
Mn and Ni and Nd, Sm, Tb and Dy magnetic moments. Further, high saturation
magnetization is achieved for all samples indicating that they are atomically
ordered and have less anti site disorders. Upon decreasing the size of rare
earth ions, the local structure shows an expansion of NiO6 octahedra and almost
unchanged MnO6 octahedra. Xray absorption near edge spectroscopy reveals that
majority of Ni and Mn ions are in positive 2 and positive 4 valence states in
all the samples. Raman spectra of RNMO show a softening of phonon modes
resulting in the elongation of Ni to O and Mn to O bond lengths. Finally, a
correlation between lattice parameters, structural distortion, octahedral
tilting, superexchange angle, and electronic band gap, Curie temperature, and

visual relationships, i.e., the (obj1, rel, obj2) triplets, relationship models

to poor generalization to rare or unseen object combinations. Therefore, we are
interested in learning object-agnostic visual features for more generalizable
relationship models. By ""agnostic"", we mean that the feature is less likely
biased to the classes of paired objects. To alleviate the bias, we propose a
novel \texttt{Shuffle-Then-Assemble} pre-training strategy. First, we discard
all the triplet relationship annotations in an image, leaving two unpaired
object domains without obj1-obj2 alignment. Then, our feature learning is to
recover possible obj1-obj2 pairs. In particular, we design a cycle of residual
transformations between the two domains, to capture shared but not
object-specific visual patterns. Extensive experiments on two visual

  In this paper, we present an image-based approach that detects and classifies
tools during laparoscopic interventions in real-time. First, potential
instrument bounding boxes are detected using a pixel-wise random forest
segmentation. Each of these bounding boxes is then classified using a cascade
of random forest. For this, multiple features, such as histograms over hue and
saturation, gradients and SURF feature, are extracted from each detected
bounding box.
  We evaluated our approach on five different videos from two different types
of procedures. We distinguished between the four most common classes of
instruments (LigaSure, atraumatic grasper, aspirator, clip applier) and
background. Our method succesfully located up to 86% of all instruments
respectively. On manually provided bounding boxes, we achieve a instrument type
recognition rate of up to 58% and on automatically detected bounding boxes up
to 49%.
  To our knowledge, this is the first approach that allows an image-based
classification of surgical tools in a laparoscopic setting in real-time.

the orbital frequency and the pulsation frequencies are $f_{\rm orb}$:$f_{\rm

companion. The short orbital period, and the low mass ratio and $M_2$

  Happens - Before Based Dynamic Race Detection",,,,,"cs.PL cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dynamic race detection is the problem of determining if an observed program
execution reveals the presence of a data race in a program. The classical
approach to solving this problem is to detect if there is a pair of conflicting
memory accesses that are unordered by Lamport's happens-before (HB) relation.
HB based race detection is known to not report false positives, i.e., it is
sound. However, the soundness guarantee of HB only promises that the first pair
of unordered, conflicting events is a schedulable data race. That is, there can
be pairs of HB-unordered conflicting data accesses that are not schedulable
races because there is no reordering of the events of the execution, where the
events in race can be executed immediately after each other. We introduce a new
partial order, called schedulable happens-before (SHB) that exactly
characterizes the pairs of schedulable data races --- every pair of conflicting
data accesses that are identified by SHB can be scheduled, and every HB-race
that can be scheduled is identified by SHB. Thus, the SHB partial order is
truly sound. We present a linear time, vector clock algorithm to detect
schedulable races using SHB. Our experiments demonstrate the value of our
algorithm for dynamic race detection --- SHB incurs only little performance
overhead and can scale to executions from real-world software applications
without compromising soundness.

aerial users is a promising solution to meet their ever-increasing
communication demands in a plethora of applications. Due to the high UAV
altitude, the channels between UAVs and the ground base stations (GBSs) are
dominated by the strong line-of-sight (LoS) links, thus severe interference may
be generated to/from the GBSs in the uplink/downlink, which renders the
interference management with coexisting terrestrial and aerial users a more
challenging problem to solve. In this paper, we study the uplink communication
from a multi-antenna UAV to a set of GBSs in its signal coverage region. Among
these GBSs, we denote available GBSs as the ones that do not serve any
terrestrial users at the assigned resource block (RB) of the UAV, and occupied
GBSs as the rest that are serving their respectively associated terrestrial
users in the same RB. We propose a new cooperative interference cancellation
strategy for the multi-beam UAV uplink communication, which aims to eliminate
the co-channel interference at each of the occupied GBSs and in the meanwhile
maximize the sum-rate to the available GBSs. Specifically, the multi-antenna
UAV sends multiple data streams to selected available GBSs, which in turn
forward their decoded data streams to their backhaul-connected occupied GBSs
for interference cancellation. To draw useful insights, the maximum
degrees-of-freedom (DoF) achievable by the multi-beam UAV communication for
sum-rate maximization in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime is first
characterized, subject to the stringent constraint that all the occupied GBSs
do not suffer from any interference in the UAV's uplink transmission. Then,
based on the DoF-optimal design, the achievable sum-rate at finite SNR is
maximized, subject to given maximum allowable interference power constraints at
each occupied GBS.

network design due to its high computational consumption. To address this
issue, we propose the Reinforced Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search (RE-
NAS), which is an evolutionary method with the reinforced mutation for NAS. Our
method integrates reinforced mutation into an evolution algorithm for neural
architecture exploration, in which a mutation controller is introduced to learn
the effects of slight modifications and make mutation actions. The reinforced
mutation controller guides the model population to evolve efficiently.
Furthermore, as child models can inherit parameters from their parents during
evolution, our method requires very limited computational resources. In
experiments, we conduct the proposed search method on CIFAR-10 and obtain a
powerful network architecture, RENASNet. This architecture achieves a
competitive result on CIFAR-10. The explored network architecture is
transferable to ImageNet and achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy, i.e.,
75.7% top-1 accuracy with 5.36M parameters on mobile ImageNet. We further test
its performance on semantic segmentation with DeepLabv3 on the PASCAL VOC.
RENASNet outperforms MobileNet-v1, MobileNet-v2 and NASNet. It achieves 75.83%

on a single image. Multi-exposure image fusion is used to produce images
without saturation regions, by using photos with different exposures. However,
it is difficult to take photos suited for the multi-exposure image fusion when
we take a photo of dynamic scenes or record a video. In addition, the
multi-exposure image fusion cannot be applied to existing images with a single
exposure or videos. The proposed method enables us to produce pseudo
multi-exposure images from a single image. To produce multi-exposure images,
the proposed method utilizes the relationship between the exposure values and
pixel values, which is obtained by assuming that a digital camera has a linear
response function. Moreover, it is shown that the use of a local contrast
enhancement method allows us to produce pseudo multi-exposure images with
higher quality. Most of conventional multi-exposure image fusion methods are
also applicable to the proposed multi-exposure images. Experimental results
show the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing the proposed one

Manifold, a framework that utilizes visual analysis techniques to support

transparent and interactive manner. Conventional techniques usually focus on
visualizing the internal logic of a specific model type (i.e., deep neural
networks), lacking the ability to extend to a more complex scenario where
different model types are integrated. To this end, Manifold is designed as a
generic framework that does not rely on or access the internal logic of the
model and solely observes the input (i.e., instances or features) and the
output (i.e., the predicted result and probability distribution). We describe
the workflow of Manifold as an iterative process consisting of three major
phases that are commonly involved in the model development and diagnosis
process: inspection (hypothesis), explanation (reasoning), and refinement
(verification). The visual components supporting these tasks include a
scatterplot-based visual summary that overviews the models' outcome and a
customizable tabular view that reveals feature discrimination. We demonstrate
current applications of the framework on the classification and regression
tasks and discuss other potential machine learning use scenarios where Manifold
can be applied.

visits the same routes multiple times and collects different appearances of it.
Multiple visual experiences usually find robotic vision applications like
visual localization, mapping, place recognition, and autonomous navigation. The
novelty in this paper is an algorithm that connects multiple visual experiences
via aligning multiple image sequences. This problem is solved by finding the
maximum flow in a directed graph flow-network, whose vertices represent the
matches between frames in the test and reference sequences. Edges of the graph
represent the cost of these matches. The problem of finding the best match is
reduced to finding the minimum-cut surface, which is solved as a maximum flow

to show the effectiveness of the proposed multiple image sequence alignment
method, without loosing its generality. Experimental evaluations show that the
precision of sequence matching is improved by considering multiple visual

approximated by piecewise linear functions with second order error in the

on successive application of these piecewise linearizations was subsequently
developed for the solution of PS equation systems. For local bijectivity of the
linearization at a root, a radius of quadratic convergence was explicitly
calculated in terms of local Lipschitz constants of the underlying PS function.
In the present work we relax the criterium of local bijectivity of the
linearization to local openness. For this purpose a weak implicit function
theorem is proved via local mapping degree theory. It is shown that there exist
PS functions $f:\mathbb R^2\rightarrow\mathbb R^2$ satisfying the weaker
criterium where every neighborhood of the root of $f$ contains a point $x$ such
that all elements of the Clarke Jacobian at $x$ are singular. In such
neighborhoods the steps of classical semismooth Newton are not defined, which
establishes the new method as an independent algorithm. To further clarify the
relation between a PS function and its piecewise linearization, several
statements about structure correspondences between the two are proved.
Moreover, the influence of the specific representation of the local piecewise
linear models on the robustness of our method is studied. An example

which encapsulates the effect of electron-electron interactions in the
many-body system. In this work we derive and implement the spin-polarized XC
kernel for semi-local approximations such as the adiabatic Generalized Gradient
Approximation (AGGA). This kernel has a quadratic dependence on the wavevector,
{\bf q}, of the perturbation, however the impact of this on the electron energy
loss spectra (EELS) is small. Although the GGA functional is good in predicting
structural properties, it generality overestimates the exchange spin-splitting.
This leads to higher magnon energies, as compared to both ALDA and experiment.
In addition, interaction with the Stoner spin-flip continuum is enhanced by
AGGA, which strongly suppresses the intensity of spin-waves.

frequency analysis of a data series constucted by recording the logarithm of
the amplification factor of the deviation vector of nearby orbits. Accordingly,
two datasets are recorded and the $\chi^2$-likelyhood of their power spectra is
computed. Ordered orbits have always the same power spectrum, so their $\chi^2

power spectrum that varies with time, hence, chaotic orbits always exhibit a
non-zero $\psi^2$ value. Even as regards ""sticky"" orbits, the PSI method is
very effective in the early detection of chaos, while the global behavior of
the $\psi^2$ indicator can provide information (also) on the intense of the
chaotic behavior, i.e., on how ""strong"" or ""weak"" the associated chaos may be.

the policy to be learned and the off-policy training data imposes statistical
and computational challenges. Unlike classical supervised learning and online
learning settings, in batch contextual bandit learning, one only has access to
a collection of logged feedback from the actions taken by a historical policy,
and expect to learn a policy that takes good actions in possibly unseen
contexts. Such a batch learning setting is ubiquitous in online and interactive
systems, such as ad platforms and recommendation systems. Existing approaches
based on inverse propensity weights, such as Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS)
and Policy Optimizer for Exponential Models (POEM), enjoy unbiasedness but
often suffer from large mean squared error. In this work, we introduce a new
approach named Maximum Likelihood Inverse Propensity Scoring (MLIPS) for batch
learning from logged bandit feedback. Instead of using the given historical
policy as the proposal in inverse propensity weights, we estimate a maximum
likelihood surrogate policy based on the logged action-context pairs, and then
use this surrogate policy as the proposal. We prove that MLIPS is
asymptotically unbiased, and moreover, has a smaller nonasymptotic mean squared
error than IPS. Such an error reduction phenomenon is somewhat surprising as
the estimated surrogate policy is less accurate than the given historical
policy. Results on multi-label classification problems and a large- scale ad
placement dataset demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of MLIPS.
Furthermore, the proposed surrogate policy technique is complementary to
existing error reduction techniques, and when combined, is able to consistently
boost the performance of several widely used approaches.

particles in $d$ dimensions, in a very general setting suitable to model
several out-of-equilibrium situations, such as liquid and glass rheology,
active self-propelled particles, and glassy aging dynamics. The pair
interaction potential is generic, and can be chosen to model colloids, atomic
liquids, and granular materials. In the limit ${d\to\infty}$, we show that the
dynamics can be exactly reduced to a single one-dimensional effective
stochastic equation, with an effective thermal bath described by kernels that
have to be determined self-consistently. We present two complementary
derivations, via a dynamical cavity method and via a path-integral approach.
From the effective stochastic equation, one can compute dynamical observables
such as pressure, shear stress, particle mean-square displacement, and the
associated response function. As an application of our results, we derive
dynamically the `state-following' equations that describe the response of a
glass to quasistatic perturbations, thus bypassing the use of replicas. The
article is written in a modular way, that allows the reader to skip the details
of the derivations and focus on the physical setting and the main results.

episodes during their lifetime. In such AGNs, corotating and counterrotating
tori, or strongly misaligned disks, as related to the central SMBH spin, can
report traces of the AGNs evolution. Here we concentrate on aggregates of
accretion disks structures, ringed accretion disks (RADs) orbiting a central
Kerr SMBH, assuming that each torus of the RADs is centered in the equatorial
plane of the BH, tori are coplanar and axisymmetric. Many RAD aspects are
governed mostly by the Kerr geometry spin. We classify Kerr BHs due to their
dimensionless spin, according to possible combinations of corotating and
counterrotating equilibrium or accreting tori composing the RADs. The number of
accreting tori in RADs cannot exceed n=2. We present list of 14 characteristic
values of the BH spin a governing the classification in the BH range 0<a<M,
constrained by the RAD properties. The spins are remarkably close providing an
accurate characterization of the Kerr BHs based on the RAD properties. RAD
dynamics is richer in the spacetimes of high spins. One of the critical
predictions states that a RAD tori couple formed by an outer accreting
corotating and an inner accreting counterrotating torus is expected to be
observed only around slowly spinning (a<0.46M) BHs. The analysis strongly binds
the fluid and BH characteristics providing indications on the situations where

question in evaluating any e-commerce search engine. While this question is
traditionally answered using simple metrics like query click-through rate
(CTR), we observe that in e-commerce search, such metrics can be misleading.
Upon inspection, we find cases where CTR is high but the results are poor and
vice versa. Similar cases exist for other metrics like time to click which are
often also used for evaluating search engines. We aim to learn the quality of
the results served by the search engine based on users' interactions with the
results. Although this problem has been studied in the web search context, this
is the first study for e-commerce search, to the best of our knowledge. Despite
certain commonalities with evaluating web search engines, there are several
major differences such as underlying reasons for search failure, and
availability of rich user interaction data with products (e.g. adding a product

on user behavior signals. We demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of such

is that modular hierarchical topologies may provide an optimal structure for
certain dynamical processes. We revisit a modular hierarchical network model
that interpolates, using a single parameter, between two known network
topologies: from strong hierarchical modularity to an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random

effect as the Kleinberg model, where the connection probability between nodes
decays algebraically with distance. We find that there is an optimal structure,
in both models, for which the pair-averaged first passage time (FPT) and mean
cover time of a discrete-time random walk are minimal, and provide a heuristic
explanation for this effect. Finally, we show that analytic predictions for the
pair-averaged FPT based on an effective medium approximation fail to reproduce
these minima, which implies that their presence is due to a network structure

this article we present a detailed study of the electrical transport properties

LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$, a prototypical multi-band superconductor. We show, through
careful measurements of the gate dependence of the magnetoresistance and
resistance fluctuations at ultra-low temperatures, that transport in the
superconducting regime of this system has contributions from two bands which
host carriers of very different characters. We identify a gate-voltage tunable
Lifshitz transition in the system and show that the resistance fluctuations
have strikingly different features on either side of it. At low carrier
densities, resistance noise is dominated by number-density fluctuations arising
from trapping-detrapping of charge carriers from defects in the underlying
SrTiO$_3$ substrate, characteristic of a single-band semiconductor. Above the
Lifshitz transition, the noise presumably originates from inter-band
scattering. Our work highlights the importance of inter-band scattering
processes in determining the transport properties of low-dimensional systems
and projects resistance fluctuation spectroscopy as a viable technique for
probing the charge carrier dynamics across a Lifshitz transition.

frequency distributions, arises in samples that are maximally informative about
the underlying generating process. In order to reach this conclusion, we first
identify the frequency with which different outcomes occur in a sample, as the
variable carrying useful information on the generative process. The entropy of
the frequency, that we call relevance, provides an upper bound to the number of
informative bits. This differs from the entropy of the data, that we take as a
measure of resolution. Samples that maximise relevance at a given resolution -
that we call maximally informative samples - exhibit statistical criticality.
In particular, Zipf's law arises at the optimal trade-off between resolution
(i.e. compression) and relevance. As a byproduct, we derive a bound of the
maximal number of parameters that can be estimated from a dataset, in the
absence of prior knowledge on the generative model.
  Furthermore, we relate criticality to the statistical properties of the
representation of the data generating process. We show that, as a consequence
of the concentration property of the Asymptotic Equipartition Property,
representations that are maximally informative about the data generating
process are characterised by an exponential distribution of energy levels. This
arises from a principle of minimal entropy, that is conjugate of the maximum
entropy principle in statistical mechanics. This explains why statistical
criticality requires no parameter fine tuning in maximally informative samples.

to communicate with humans, which increased also the popularity of affective
embodied models that adopt different emotional concepts in many everyday tasks.
However, there is still a gap between the development of these solutions and
the integration and development of a complex emotion appraisal system, which is
much necessary for true social robots. In this paper, we propose a deep neural
model which is designed in the light of different aspects of developmental
learning of emotional concepts to provide an integrated solution for internal
and external emotion appraisal. We evaluate the performance of the proposed
model with different challenging corpora and compare it with state-of-the-art

model, we designed and collected a novel dataset based on a Human-Robot

evaluated the capability of the robot to learn and describe the affective
behavior of different persons based on observation. The performed experiments
demonstrate that the proposed model is competitive with the state of the art in
describing emotion behavior in general. In addition, it is able to generate
internal emotional concepts that evolve through time: it continuously forms and
updates the formed emotional concepts, which is a step towards creating an
emotional appraisal model grounded in the robot experiences.

are the major challenges of category-level tasks. In this study, we address
category-level full 6D object pose estimation in the context of depth modality,
introducing a novel part-based architecture that can tackle the above-mentioned
challenges. Our architecture particularly adapts the distribution shifts
arising from shape discrepancies, and naturally removes the variations of
texture, illumination, pose, etc., so we call it as ""Intrinsic Structure
Adaptor (ISA)"". We engineer ISA based on the followings: i) ""Semantically
Selected Centers (SSC)"" are proposed in order to define the ""6D pose"" at the
level of categories. ii) 3D skeleton structures, which we derive as
shape-invariant features, are used to represent the parts extracted from the
instances of given categories, and privileged one-class learning is employed
based on these parts. iii) Graph matching is performed during training in such
a way that the adaptation/generalization capability of the proposed
architecture is improved across unseen instances. Experiments validate the
promising performance of the proposed architecture on both synthetic and real
datasets.

custom designed for the European x-ray Free-Electron Laser (XFEL). It is a
fast, low noise integrating detector, with an adaptive gain amplifier per
pixel. This has an equivalent noise of less than 1 keV when detecting single
photons and, when switched into another gain state, a dynamic range of more
than 10$^4$ photons of 12 keV. In burst mode the system is able to store 352
images while running at up to 6.5 MHz, which is compatible with the 4.5 MHz
frame rate at the European XFEL. The AGIPD system was installed and
commissioned in August 2017, and successfully used for the first experiments at
the Single Particles, Clusters and Biomolecules (SPB) experimental station at
the European XFEL since September 2017. This paper describes the principal

visual scene. Many animals develop the perceptual ability to subitize: the
near-instantaneous identification of the numerosity in small sets of visual
items. In computer vision, it has been shown that numerosity emerges as a
statistical property in neural networks during unsupervised learning from
simple synthetic images. In this work, we focus on more complex natural images
using unsupervised hierarchical neural networks. Specifically, we show that
variational autoencoders are able to spontaneously perform subitizing after
training without supervision on a large amount images from the Salient Object
Subitizing dataset. While our method is unable to outperform supervised
convolutional networks for subitizing, we observe that the networks learn to
encode numerosity as basic visual property. Moreover, we find that the learned
representations are likely invariant to object area; an observation in
alignment with studies on biological neural networks in cognitive neuroscience.

navigation. While solutions have been proposed for static obstacle avoidance,
systems enabling avoidance of dynamic objects, such as drones, are hard to
implement due to the detection range and field-of-view (FOV) requirements, as
well as the constraints for integrating such systems on-board small UAVs. In
this work, a dataset of 6k synthetic depth maps of drones has been generated
and used to train a state-of-the-art deep learning-based drone detection model.
While many sensing technologies can only provide relative altitude and azimuth
of an obstacle, our depth map-based approach enables full 3D localization of
the obstacle. This is extremely useful for collision avoidance, as 3D
localization of detected drones is key to perform efficient collision-free path
planning. The proposed detection technique has been validated in several real
depth map sequences, with multiple types of drones flying at up to 2 m/s,
achieving an average precision of 98.7%, an average recall of 74.7% and a
record detection range of 9.5 meters.

whether the current state belongs to a set of critical states. In
safety-critical applications, critical states model operations that may be

observability for linear switching systems, and Pola et al. adapted it for

computational complexity of deciding critical observability for systems modeled
as (networks of) finite-state automata and Petri nets. We show that deciding
critical observability is (i) NL-complete for finite automata, that is, it is
efficiently verifiable on parallel computers, (ii) PSPACE-complete for networks
of finite automata, that is, it is very unlikely solvable in polynomial time,
and (iii) undecidable for labeled Petri nets, but becoming decidable if the set
of critical states (markings) is finite or co-finite, in which case the problem
is as hard as the non-reachability problem for Petri nets.

accuracy of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the case when scarce
training data is available. Our approach consists in adding a saliency branch
to an existing CNN architecture which is used to modulate the standard
bottom-up visual features from the original image input, acting as an
attentional mechanism that guides the feature extraction process. The main aim
of the proposed approach is to enable the effective training of a fine-grained
recognition model with limited training samples and to improve the performance
on the task, thereby alleviating the need to annotate large dataset. % The vast
majority of saliency methods are evaluated on their ability to generate
saliency maps, and not on their functionality in a complete vision pipeline.
Our proposed pipeline allows to evaluate saliency methods for the high-level
task of object recognition. We perform extensive experiments on various
fine-grained datasets (Flowers, Birds, Cars, and Dogs) under different
conditions and show that saliency can considerably improve the network's
performance, especially for the case of scarce training data. Furthermore, our
experiments show that saliency methods that obtain improved saliency maps (as
measured by traditional saliency benchmarks) also translate to saliency methods
that yield improved performance gains when applied in an object recognition
pipeline.

cooperative cognitive radio network, i.e., a radio system where a Secondary
user may act as relay for messages sent by the Primary user, hence offering
performance improvement of Primary user transmissions, while at the same time
obtaining more transmission opportunities for its own transmissions.
Specifically, we examine the possibility of improving the overall system
performance by employing network coding techniques. The objective is to achieve
this while affecting Primary user transmissions only positively, namely: 1)
avoid network coding operations at the Primary transmitter in order avoid
increase of its complexity and storage requirements, 2) keep the order of
packets received by the Primary receiver the same as in the non cooperative
case and 3) induce packet service times that are stochastically smaller than
packet service times induced in the non-cooperative case. A network coding
algorithm is investigated in terms of achieved throughput region and it is
shown to enlarge Secondary user throughput as compared to the case where the
Secondary transmitter acts as a simple relay, while leaving the Primary user
stability region unaffected. A notable feature of this algorithm is that it
operates without knowledge of channel and packet arrival rate statistics. We
also investigate a second network coding algorithm which increases the
throughput region of the system; however, the latter algorithm requires
knowledge of channel and packet arrival rate statistics.

accretion discs have been discussed for several decades. Recent simulations
combining convection and the magnetorotational instability have given fresh
impetus to the debate, as the interplay of the two processes can enhance
angular momentum transport, at least in the optically thick outburst stage of
dwarf novae. In this paper we seek to isolate and understand the most generic
features of disc convection, and so undertake its study in purely
hydrodynamical models. First, we investigate the linear phase of the
instability, obtaining estimates of the growth rates both semi-analytically,
using one-dimensional spectral computations, as well as analytically, using
WKBJ methods. Next we perform three-dimensional, vertically stratified,
shearing box simulations with the conservative, finite-volume code PLUTO, both
with and without explicit diffusion coefficients. We find that hydrodynamic
convection can, in general, drive outward angular momentum transport, a result
that we confirm with ATHENA, an alternative finite-volume code. Moreover, we
establish that the sign of the angular momentum flux is sensitive to the
diffusivity of the numerical scheme. Finally, in sustained convection, whereby
the system is continuously forced to an unstable state, we observe the
formation of various coherent structures, including large- scale and
oscillatory convective cells, zonal flows, and small vortices.

hydrodynamic interactions. We show that the results from GLD simulations
perfectly reproduce the dynamics of the underlying fine-grained system. The
effective speedup of these simulations amounts to a factor of about $10^4$.
Additionally, the transferability of the coarse-grained model with respect to
changes of the nanocolloid density is investigated. The results indicate that
the model is transferable to systems with nanocolloid densities that differ by
up to one order of magnitude from the density of the reference system.

address this challenge by performing non-rigid label propagation on the
annotations and introducing an exponentially weighted loss function for
training. Experiments on aortic MR image sequences demonstrate that the
proposed method significantly improves both accuracy and temporal smoothness of
segmentation, compared to a baseline method that utilises spatial information
only. It achieves an average Dice metric of 0.960 for the ascending aorta and
0.953 for the descending aorta.

shortcut. Consequently, compared to the standard 1-bit CNN, the
representational capability of the Bi-Real net is significantly enhanced and
the additional cost on computation is negligible. Moreover, we develop a
specific training algorithm including three technical novelties for 1- bit

has correct beliefs about the evolution of objective states as well as at the
case when her beliefs are incorrect but unforeseen contingencies are

extending 2D anchors to 3D-cuboid proposals on stacks of frames, to generate

However, they fail to consider that the underlying anchor proposal hypotheses
should also move (transition) from frame to frame, as the actor or the camera
does. Assuming we evaluate $n$ 2D anchors in each frame, then the number of
possible transitions from each 2D anchor to the next, for a sequence of $f$
consecutive frames, is in the order of $O(n^f)$, expensive even for small
values of $f$. To avoid this problem, we introduce a Transition-Matrix-based
Network (TraMNet) which relies on computing transition probabilities between
anchor proposals while maximising their overlap with ground truth bounding
boxes across frames, and enforcing sparsity via a transition threshold. As the
resulting transition matrix is sparse and stochastic, this reduces the proposal
hypothesis search space from $O(n^f)$ to the cardinality of the thresholded
matrix. At training time, transitions are specific to cell locations of the
feature maps, so that a sparse (efficient) transition matrix is used to train
the network. At test time, a denser transition matrix can be obtained either by
decreasing the threshold or by adding to it all the relative transitions
originating from any cell location, allowing the network to handle transitions
in the test data that might not have been present in the training data, and
making detection translation-invariant. Finally, we show that our network can
handle sparse annotations such as those available in the DALY dataset. We
report extensive experiments on the DALY, UCF101-24 and Transformed-UCF101-24

competitive performance on a recently-released visual question answering
datasets, equalling and in some cases surpassing similar soft attention
architectures while entirely ignoring some features. Even though the hard
attention mechanism is thought to be non-differentiable, we found that the
feature magnitudes correlate with semantic relevance, and provide a useful
signal for our mechanism's attentional selection criterion. Because hard
attention selects important features of the input information, it can also be
more efficient than analogous soft attention mechanisms. This is especially
important for recent approaches that use non-local pairwise operations, whereby
computational and memory costs are quadratic in the size of the set of
features.

encompasses phenomena of different natures such as the dynamic encoding of
gonadotropin secretion, and the intracellular cascades triggered by
gonadotropin binding to their cognate receptors, resulting in a variety of
biological outcomes. We overview historical and ongoing issues in modeling and
data analysis related to gonadotropin secretion in the field of both physiology
and neuro-endocrinology. We mention the different mathematical formalisms
involved, their interest and limits. We discuss open statistical questions in
signal analysis associated with key endocrine issues. We also review recent
advances in the modeling of the intracellular pathways activated by
gonadotropins, which yields promising development for innovative approaches in
drug discovery. The greatest challenge to be tackled in computational modeling
of pituitary gonadotropin signaling is the embedding of gonadotropin signaling
within its natural multi-scale environment, from the single cell level, to the
organic and whole HPG level. The development of modeling approaches of G

adequate. Piecewise affine (PWA) models can describe the underlying nonlinear

their use in multi-model linear MPC configurations, which avoid integer

closed loop stability. In this work, we propose an input to output stability
analysis for closed loop systems, consisting of PWA models, where an observer
and multi-model linear MPC are applied together, under unstructured
uncertainty. Integral quadratic constraints (IQCs) are employed to assess the
robustness of MPC under uncertainty. We create a model pool, by performing
linearisation on selected transient points. All the possible uncertainties and
nonlinearities (including the controller) can be introduced in the framework,
assuming that they admit the appropriate IQCs, whilst the dissipation

the existence of static multipliers, which can reduce the conservatism of the

strongly antagonized LH/CGR signaling in both HEK293 and mLTC-1 cells. ADX68693
appeared more potent than ADX68692 to inhibit hCG-induced cAMP and
\beta-arrestin 2 in HEK293 and mLTC-1 cells whereas no significant difference
in their efficacy on hCG-promoted \beta-arrestin 2 recruitment. Interestingly,
differential antagonism of the two NAMs on hCG-promoted steroidogenesis in

progesterone production. These observations suggest biased effects of the two
NAMs on LH/CGR-dependent pathways controlling steroidogenesis, which appeared
to be different to that previously shown on FSHR. This also illustrates the
complexity of signaling pathways controlling FSHR- and LH/CGR-mediated
steroidogenesis, suggesting differential implication of cAMP and
\beta-arrestins. Together, our data demonstrate that ADX68692 and ADX68693 are

for many vision related applications like object detection, classification, and

designed models, such as reduced feature resolution in the encoding process or
imbalanced data distributions. A large amount of deep learning based network
structures has been proposed in recent years to deal with these individual
factors and improve network performance. However, to our knowledge, no existing
work in semantic image segmentation is designed to tackle confusion errors
explicitly. In this paper, we present a novel and general network structure
that reduces confusion errors in more direct manner and apply the network for
semantic segmentation. There are two major contributions in our network
structure: 1) We ensemble subnets with heterogeneous output spaces based on the
discriminative confusing groups. The training for each subnet can distinguish
confusing classes within the group without affecting unrelated classes outside
the group. 2) We propose an improved cross-entropy loss function that maximizes
the probability assigned to the correct class and penalizes the probabilities
assigned to the confusing classes at the same time. Our network structure is a
general structure and can be easily adapted to any other networks to further
reduce confusion errors. Without any changes in the feature encoder and
post-processing steps, our experiments demonstrate consistent and significant
improvements on different baseline models on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC datasets

derive a thin film model in the lubrication limit which describes an
inextensible liquid membrane with bending rigidity confined between two
adhesive walls. The resulting equations share similarities with the
Swift-Hohenberg model. However, inextensibility is enforced by a time-dependent
nonlocal tension. Depending on the excess membrane area available in the
system, three different dynamical regimes, denoted as A, B and C, are found
from the numerical solution of the model. In regime A, membranes with small
excess area form flat adhesion domains and freeze. Such freezing is interpreted
by means of an effective model for curvature-driven domain wall motion. The
nonlocal membrane tension tends to a negative value corresponding to the linear
stability threshold of flat domain walls in the Swift-Hohenberg equation. In
regime B, membranes with intermediate excess areas exhibit endless coarsening
with coexistence of flat adhesion domains and wrinkle domains. The tension
tends to the nonlinear stability threshold of flat domain walls in the
Swift-Hohenberg equation. The fraction of the system covered by the wrinkle
phase increases linearly with the excess area in regime B. In regime C,
membranes with large excess area are completely covered by a frozen
labyrinthine pattern of wrinkles. As the excess area is increased, the tension
increases and the wavelength of the wrinkles decreases. For large membrane
area, there is a crossover to a regime where the extrema of the wrinkles are in
contact with the walls. In all regimes after an initial transient, robust
localised structures form, leading to an exact conservation of the number of
adhesion domains.

violations of Bell-type inequalities. However, even unentangled systems, whose
parts may have been prepared separately, can show nonlocal properties. In
particular, a set of product states is said to exhibit ""quantum nonlocality
without entanglement"" if the states are locally indistinguishable, i.e. it is
not possible to optimally distinguish the states by any sequence of local
operations and classical communication. Here, we present a stronger
manifestation of this kind of nonlocality in multiparty systems through the
notion of local irreducibility. A set of multiparty orthogonal quantum states
is defined to be locally irreducible if it is not possible to locally eliminate
one or more states from the set while preserving orthogonality of the
postmeasurement states. Such a set, by definition, is locally
indistinguishable, but we show that the converse doesn't always hold. We
provide the first examples of orthogonal product bases on
$\mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{d}$ for $d=3,4$ that are
locally irreducible in all bipartitions, where the construction for $d=3$
achieves the minimum dimension necessary for such product states to exist. The
existence of such product bases implies that local implementation of a

further towards understanding whether other socially marginalized cues

female-gendering, are associated with the manifestation of dehumanization
(e.g., objectification, stereotyping) in human-robot interactions. To that end,
we analyzed free-form comments (N=535) on three videos, each depicting a gynoid

respectively. As a preliminary control, we additionally analyzed commentary
(N=674) on three videos depicting women embodying similar identity cues. The
analyses indicate that people more frequently dehumanize robots racialized as
Asian and Black, than they do of robots racialized as White. Additional,
preliminary evaluation of how people's responding towards the gynoids compares
to that towards other people suggests that the gynoids' ontology (as robots)
further facilitates the dehumanization.

semimetals. Here we investigate the IF shift in two types of topological
systems, topological semimetals with pseudospin-$N/2$ for an arbitrary integer
$N$, and nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs). For the former, we find the IF shift
depends on the components of the pseudospin, with the sign depending on the
chirality. We term this phenomenon the pseudospin Hall effect of topological
fermions. The shift can also be interpreted as a consequence of the
conservation of the total angular momentum. For the latter, if the NLSM has
both time-reversal and inversion symmetries, the IF shift is zero; otherwise it
could be finite. We take the NLSM with a vortex ring, which breaks both
symmetries, as an example, and show that the IF shift can be used to detect
topological Lifshitz transitions. Finally, we propose experimental designs to
detect the IF shift.

Nitsche's technique in a Cut Finite Element Method (CutFEM) framework. At the
fluid-solid interface, standard weak coupling of node-matching or non-matching
finite element approximations can be utilized. As the fluid subdomains can be
meshed independently, a sufficient mesh quality in the vicinity of the common
fluid-structure interface can be assured. To our knowledge the proposed method
is the only method (despite some overlapping domain decomposition approaches
that suffer from other issues) that allows for capturing boundary layers and
flow detachment via appropriate grids around largely moving and deforming
bodies and is able to do this e.g. without the necessity of costly remeshing
procedures. In addition it might also help to safe computational costs as now
background grids can be much coarser. Various FSI-cases of rising complexity
conclude the work.

The CCH and CS emission reveal an outflow cavity structure with clear
signatures of rotation with respect to the outflow axis. The rotation is
detected from about 120 au up to about 1400 au above the envelope/disk
mid-plane. As the distance to the central source increases, the rotation
velocity of the outflow decreases while the outflow radius increases, which
gives a flat specific angular momentum distribution along the outflow. The mean
specific angular momentum of the outflow is about 100 au km/s. Based on
reasonable assumptions on the outward velocity of the outflow and the protostar
mass, we estimate the range of outflow launching radii to be 5-15 au. Such a
launching radius rules out that this outflow is launched as an X-wind, but
rather, it is more consistent to be a slow disk wind launched from relatively
large radii on the disk. The radius of the centrifugal barrier is roughly
estimated, and the role of the centrifugal barrier in the outflow launching is
discussed.

complete set of gating experiments on Ti-based superconducting Dayem bridges

critical current IC measurements highlight the following: the suppression of IC

critical temperature independence from the electric field and the gate-induced
growth of a sub-gap dissipative component. In addition, the temperature
dependence of the Josephson critical current seems to show the transition from
the ballistic Kulik-Omelyanchuck behavior to the Ambegaokar-Baratoff
tunnel-like characteristic by increasing the electric field. Furthermore, the
IC suppression persists in the presence of sizeable perpendicular-to-plane
magnetic fields. We propose a classical thermodynamic model able to describe
some of the experimental observations of the present and previous works. Above
all, the model grabs the bipolar electric field induced suppression of IC and
the emergence of a sub-gap dissipative component near full suppression of the
supercurrent. Finally, applications employing the discussed effect are
proposed.

cosmological neutrinos become part of the total matter field and contribute to
its smoothing. Structure formation in the presence of massive neutrinos is
therefore impeded compared to that in the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with
massless neutrinos. Neutrinos' masses also distort the anisotropy power
spectrum of cosmic microwave background (CMB). Furthermore, a finite chemical
potential $\mu$ for cosmological neutrinos, still allowed by current data,
would have a non-negligible impact on CMB and structure formation. We
consistently evaluate effects of neutrino masses and chemical potentials on the
matter power spectrum by use of a neutrino-involved N-body simulation, with
cosmological parameters obtained from a Markov-Chian Moonte-Carlo (MCMC)
refitting of CMB data. Our results show that while a finite averaged neutrino
mass $m_\nu$ tends to suppress the matter power spectrum in a range of wave
numbers, the neutrino degeneracy parameters ${\xi_i \equiv \mu_i /T}$ ($i=$1,
2, 3) enhance the latter, leading to a large parameter degeneracy between
$m_\nu$ and $\xi_i$. We provide an empirical formula for the effects on the
matter power spectrum in a selected range of wave numbers induced by $m_\nu$

Inspired
by Active Appearance Models, we develop a data-driven rendering pipeline that
learns a joint representation of facial geometry and appearance from a
multiview capture setup. Vertex positions and view-specific textures are
modeled using a deep variational autoencoder that captures complex nonlinear
effects while producing a smooth and compact latent representation.
View-specific texture enables the modeling of view-dependent effects such as
specularity. In addition, it can also correct for imperfect geometry stemming
from biased or low resolution estimates. This is a significant departure from
the traditional graphics pipeline, which requires highly accurate geometry as
well as all elements of the shading model to achieve realism through
physically-inspired light transport. Acquiring such a high level of accuracy is
difficult in practice, especially for complex and intricate parts of the face,
such as eyelashes and the oral cavity. These are handled naturally by our
approach, which does not rely on precise estimates of geometry. Instead, the
shading model accommodates deficiencies in geometry though the flexibility
afforded by the neural network employed. At inference time, we condition the
decoding network on the viewpoint of the camera in order to generate the
appropriate texture for rendering. The resulting system can be implemented
simply using existing rendering engines through dynamic textures with flat
lighting. This representation, together with a novel unsupervised technique for
mapping images to facial states, results in a system that is naturally suited
to real-time interactive settings such as Virtual Reality (VR).

in the visible domain), it will offer the possibility to do binocular
observations combining direct imaging, coronagraphic imaging and coronagraphic
low resolution spectroscopy in a wide wavelength domain, going from 0.5{\mu}m
to 1.7{\mu}m. Additionally, the contemporary usage of LMIRCam, the
coronagraphic LBTI NIR camera, working from K to L band, will extend even more
the covered wavelength range. In January 2017 SHARK-NIR underwent a successful
final design review, which endorsed the instrument for construction and future
implementation at LBT. We report here the final design of the instrument, which
foresees two intermediate pupil planes and three focal planes to accomodate a
certain number of coronagraphic techniques, selected to maximize the instrument
contrast at various distances from the star. Exo-Planets search and
characterization has been the science case driving the instrument design, but
the SOUL upgrade of the LBT AO will increase the instrument performance in the
faint end regime, allowing to do galactic (jets and disks) and extra-galactic

Classification between relevant pedestrians that cross the street or are within
the vehicle path and those that are on the sidewalks and move along the vehicle
rout can significantly minimize a number of vehicle-to-pedestrian accidents.
  This work proposes a novel technique for a pedestrian direction of motion
estimation which treats pedestrians as complex distributed targets and utilizes
their micro-Doppler (MD) radar signatures. The MD signatures are shown to be
indicative of pedestrian direction of motion, and the supervised regression is
used to estimate the mapping between the directions of motion and the
corresponding MD signatures. In order to achieve higher regression performance,
the state of the art sparse dictionary learning based feature extraction
algorithm was adopted from the field of computer vision by drawing a parallel
between the Doppler effect and the video temporal gradient.
  The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated in a practical
automotive scenario simulations, where a walking pedestrian is observed by a
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) automotive radar with a 2D rectangular
array. The simulated data was generated using the statistical Boulic-Thalman
human locomotion model. Accurate direction of motion estimation was achieved by
using a support vector regression (SVR) and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) based
regression algorithms. The results show that the direction estimation error is
less than $10^{\circ}$ in $95\%$ of the tested cases, for pedestrian at the

the z-direction. There are therefore two frequencies characterizing the system:
the usual cyclotron frequency $\omega_c$ corresponding to motion along the x-y
plane and associated with Landau levels and a second frequency $\omega_z$ for
motion along the z-direction. Most importantly, when the ratio
$W=\omega_c/\omega_z$ is a rational number, the degeneracy of the energy levels
does not remain always constant as the energy increases. At some energies, the
degeneracy jumps i.e. it increases. In particular, when the two frequencies are
equal, the degeneracy increases with each energy level. This is in stark
contrast to the usual Landau levels where the degeneracy is independent of the
energy. We derive compact analytical formulas for the degeneracy. We also
obtain an analytical formula for the energy levels and plot them as a function
of $W$. The increase in degeneracy can readily be seen in the plot at points
where lines intersect. For concreteness, we consider the electric field
produced by a uniformly charged ring. Besides a linear electric field in the z

analyzed in a four component Universe (dark matter, dark energy, baryonic
matter and radiation) in the approximation of relativistic hydrodynamics.
Evolution of density and velocity perturbations of each component is obtained
by integration of a system of nine differential equations from $z=10^8$ up to
virialization, which is described phenomenologically. It is shown that the
number density of dark matter halos with masses
$M\sim10^8-10^9\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ virialized at $z\sim10$ is close to the
number density of galaxies in comoving coordinates. The dynamical dark energy
of classical scalar field type does not significantly influence the evolution
of the other components, but dark energy with a small value of effective sound
speed can affect the final halo state. Simultaneously, the
formation/dissociation of the first molecules have been analyzed in the halos
which are forming. The results show that number densities of molecules
$\rm{H_2}$ and $\rm{HD}$ at the moment of halo virialization are $\sim10^3$ and
$\sim400$ times larger, respectively, than on a uniformly expanding background.
It is caused by increased density and rates of reactions at quasilinear and
nonlinear evolution stages of density and velocity of the baryonic component of
halos. It is shown also that the temperature history of the halo is important
for calculating the concentration of molecular ions with low binding energy.
So, in a halo with virial temperature $\sim10^5$ K the number density of the
molecular ion HeH$^+$ is approximately 100 times smaller than that on the
cosmological background.

data samples arise from different distributions without imposing any parametric
assumptions on those distributions. However, raw data samples can expose
sensitive information about individuals who participate in scientific studies,
which makes the current tests vulnerable to privacy breaches. Hence, we design
a new framework for kernel two-sample testing conforming to differential
privacy constraints, in order to guarantee the privacy of subjects in the data.
Unlike existing differentially private parametric tests that simply add noise
to data, kernel-based testing imposes a challenge due to a complex dependence
of test statistics on the raw data, as these statistics correspond to
estimators of distances between representations of probability measures in
Hilbert spaces. Our approach considers finite dimensional approximations to
those representations. As a result, a simple chi-squared test is obtained,
where a test statistic depends on a mean and covariance of empirical
differences between the samples, which we perturb for a privacy guarantee. We
investigate the utility of our framework in two realistic settings and conclude
that our method requires only a relatively modest increase in sample size to
achieve a similar level of power to the non-private tests in both settings.

Giant planets open gaps in their protoplanetary and subsequently
suffer so-called type II migration. Schematically, planets are thought to be
tightly locked within their surrounding disks, and forced to follow the viscous
advection of gas onto the central star. This fundamental principle however has
recently been questioned, as migrating planets were shown to decouple from the
gas' radial drift. Aims. In this framework, we question whether the
traditionally used linear scaling of migration rate of a giant planet with the
disk's viscosity still holds. Additionally, we assess the role of
orbit-crossing material as part of the decoupling mechanism. Methods. We have
performed 2D (r, {\theta}) numerical simulations of point-mass planets embedded
in locally isothermal {\alpha}-disks in steady-state accretion, with various
values of {\alpha}. Arbitrary planetary accretion rates were used as a means to
diminish or nullify orbit-crossing flows. Results. We confirm that the
migration rate of a gap-opening planet is indeed proportional to the disk's
viscosity, but is not equal to the gas drift speed in the unperturbed disk. We
show that the role of gap-crossing flows is in fact negligible. Conclusions.
From these observations, we propose a new paradigm for type II migration : a
giant planet feels a torque from the disk that promotes its migration, while
the gap profile relative to the planet is restored on a viscous timescale, thus
limiting the planet migration rate to be proportional to the disk's viscosity.
Hence, in disks with low viscosity in the planet region, type II migration
should still be very slow. Key words. protoplanetary disks; planet-disk
interactions; planets and satellites: formation

of crossings in a good straight-line drawing of $G$ in the plane. In a good
drawing any two edges intersect in at most one point (counting endpoints), no
three edges have an interior point in common, and edges do not contain vertices
in their interior. A spider is a subdivision of $K_{1,k}$. We provide both
upper and lower bounds for the maximum rectilinear crossing number of spiders.
While there are not many results on the maximum rectilinear crossing numbers of
infinite families of graphs, our methods can be used to find the exact maximum
rectilinear crossing number of $K_{1,k}$ where each edge is subdivided exactly
once. This is a first step towards calculating the maximum rectilinear crossing

alleviate the problem of low-quality labels in this context, multiple human
factors have been analyzed to identify and deal with workers who provide such

difficulty of tweets to be labeled and how this affects the reliability of the
labels that annotators assign to such tweets. Therefore, we investigate in this
preliminary study this connection using a hierarchical sentiment labeling task
on Twitter. We find that there is indeed a relationship between both factors,
assuming that annotators have labeled some tweets before: labels assigned to
easy tweets are more reliable than those assigned to difficult tweets.
Therefore, training predictors on easy tweets enhances the performance by up to
6% in our experiment. This implies potential improvements for active learning

architecture design for a given image classification task. We propose a method
that aggregates two main results of the previous state-of-the-art in neural

a search scheme based on sequential model-based optimization (SMBO), and
increasing training efficiency by sharing weights among sampled architectures.
Sequential search has previously demonstrated its capabilities to find
state-of-the-art neural architectures for image classification. However, its
computational cost remains high, even unreachable under modest computational
settings. Affording SMBO with weight-sharing alleviates this problem. On the
other hand, progressive search with SMBO is inherently greedy, as it leverages
a learned surrogate function to predict the validation error of neural
architectures. This prediction is directly used to rank the sampled neural
architectures. We propose to attenuate the greediness of the original SMBO
method by relaxing the role of the surrogate function so it predicts
architecture sampling probability instead. We demonstrate with experiments on
the CIFAR-10 dataset that our method, denominated Efficient progressive neural

with the entropy increase. However, the underlying microscopic dynamics of the
many-body system, either the (quantum) von Neumann or (classical) Liouville
equation, guarantees the entropy of an isolated system does not change with
time. Notice that, in practical measurements, usually it is the partial
information (e.g., marginal distribution, few-body observable expectation) that
is directly accessible to our observations, rather than the full ensemble
state. But indeed such partial information is sufficient to give most
macroscopic thermodynamic quantities, and they exhibits irreversible behaviors.
At the same time, there is some correlation entropy hiding in the full
ensemble, i.e., the mutual information between different marginal
distributions, but difficult to be sensed in practice. We notice that such
correlation production is closely related to the macroscopic entropy increase
in the standard thermodynamics. In open systems, the irreversible entropy
production of the open system can be proved to be equivalent with the
correlation production between the open system and its environment. During the
free diffusion of an isolated ideal gas, the correlation between the spatial
and momentum distributions is increasing monotonically, and it could well
reproduce the entropy increase result in the standard thermodynamics. In the
presence of particle collisions, the single-particle distribution always
approaches the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution as its steady state, and its
entropy increase indeed indicates the correlation production between the
particles. In all these examples, the total entropy of the whole isolated
system keeps constant. In this sense, the macroscopic irreversibility and the
reversible microscopic dynamics coincide with each other.

average higher percentages of absorbed Lyman continuum photons ($\sim$51%) and

the change in cost due to change in state. This work proposes a new method to
compute these costs, without the need of explicitly modelling the factors. The
identified cost is modelled in a bi-linear state-space form where the change of

model all factors to derive the cost for every robot. In context of
transportation, the travel time is identified as the key parameter to
understand costs of traversing paths to carry material. The necessity to
identify and estimate these travel times is proved by using them in route
planning. The paths are computed constantly and average of total path costs of

poor weather and food shortage. Such challenges can initiate the hormonal
stress response, which involves secretion of glucocorticoids. Although the
hormonal stress response helps organisms deal with challenges, long-term
exposure to high levels of glucocorticoids can have morphological, behavioral,
and physiological consequences, especially during development. Glucocorticoids
are also associated with reduced survival and telomere shortening. To
investigate whether brief, acute exposures to glucocorticoids can also produce
these phenotypic effects in free-living birds, we exposed wild tree swallow
(Tachycineta bicolor) nestlings to a brief exogenous dose of cort once per day
for five days and then measured their morphology, baseline and stress-induced
corticosterone levels, and telomere length. We also deployed radio tags on a
subset of nestlings, which allowed us to determine the age at which tagged
nestlings left the nest (fledged) and their pattern of presence and absence at
the natal site during the post-breeding period. Corticosterone-treated
nestlings had lower mass, higher baseline and stress-induced corticosterone,
and reduced telomeres; other metrics of morphology were affected weakly or not
at all. Our treatment resulted in no significant effect on survival to
fledging, fledge age, or age at first departure from the natal site, and we
found no negative effect of corticosterone on inter-annual return rate. These
results show that brief acute corticosterone exposure during development can
have measurable effects on phenotype in free-living tree swallows.

actions for reaching control objectives, requiring a trade-off between
exploration and exploitation. The specific problem setting considered here is
for discrete-time nonlinear systems, with process noise, input-constraints, and
parameter uncertainty. This article frames this problem as a Bayes-adaptive
Markov decision process and solves it online using Monte Carlo tree search with
an unscented Kalman filter to account for process noise and parameter
uncertainty. This method is compared with certainty equivalent model predictive
control and a tree search method that approximates the QMDP solution, providing
insight into when information gathering is useful. Discrete time simulations
characterize performance over a range of process noise and bounds on unknown
parameters. An offline optimization method is used to select the Monte Carlo
tree search parameters without hand-tuning. In lieu of recursive feasibility
guarantees, a probabilistic bounding heuristic is offered that increases the

simulation functions enabling us to employ an abstract system as a substitution
of the original one in the controller design process with guaranteed error
bounds. In the first part of the paper, we derive sufficient small-gain type
conditions for the compositional quantification of the probabilistic distance
between the interconnection of stochastic control subsystems and that of their
infinite abstractions. We then construct infinite abstractions together with
their corresponding stochastic simulation functions for a particular class of
discrete-time nonlinear stochastic control systems. In the second part of the
paper, we leverage small-gain type conditions for the compositional
construction of finite abstractions. We propose an approach to construct finite
MDPs as finite abstractions of concrete models or their reduced-order versions
satisfying an incremental input-to-state stability property. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed results by applying our approaches to a fully
interconnected network of 20 nonlinear subsystems (totally 100 dimensions). We
construct finite MDPs from their reduced-order versions (together 20

We examine in detail particular scenarios in which the burst population follows
some power of the cosmic star formation rate. FRBs present an important
additional measurable over source counts of existing cosmological populations,
namely the dispersion measure. Based on the known redshift of FRB121102 (the
repeater) we expect at least 50% of the dispersion measure to be attributable
to the inter-galactic medium and hence it can be used as a proxy for distance.
We develop the framework to interpret the dispersion measure distribution, and
investigate how the effect of Helium reionization in the intergalactic medium
is evident in this distribution. Examination of existing data suggests that the
FRB luminosity function is flatter than a critical slope, making FRBs easily
detectable to large distances; in this regime the reduction in flux density
with distance is outweighed by the increase in the number of bright bursts

heterogeneous media in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ via a
variety of $n$-point correlation functions is of great importance, since the
respective infinite set determines the effective physical properties of the
media. In particular, surface-surface $F_{ss}$ and surface-void $F_{sv}$
correlation functions (obtainable from radiation scattering experiments)
contain crucial interfacial information that enables one to estimate transport
properties of the media (e.g., the mean survival time and fluid permeability)
and complements the information content of the conventional two-point
correlation function. However, the current technical difficulty involved in
sampling surface correlation functions has been a stumbling block in their
widespread use. We first present a concise derivation of the small-$r$
behaviors of these functions, which are linked to the \textit{mean curvature}
of the system. Then we demonstrate that one can reduce the computational
complexity of the problem by extracting the necessary interfacial information
from a cut of the system with an infinitely long line. Accordingly, we devise
algorithms based on this idea and test them for two-phase media in continuous
and discrete spaces. Specifically for the exact benchmark model of overlapping
spheres, we find excellent agreement between numerical and exact results. We
compute surface correlation functions and corresponding local surface-area
variances for a variety of other model microstructures, including hard spheres
in equilibrium, decorated ""stealthy"" patterns, as well as snapshots of evolving
pattern formation processes (e.g., spinodal decomposition). It is demonstrated
that the precise determination of surface correlation functions provides a
powerful means to characterize a wide class of complex multiphase

of spiking neural networks. Neurons are modelled as timed automata waiting for
inputs on a number of different channels (synapses), for a given amount of time
(the accumulation period). When this period is over, the current potential
value is computed considering current and past inputs. If this potential
overcomes a given threshold, the automaton emits a broadcast signal over its
output channel , otherwise it restarts another accumulation period. After each
emission, the automaton remains inactive for a fixed refractory period. Spiking
neural networks are formalised as sets of automata, one for each neuron,
running in parallel and sharing channels according to the network structure.
Such a model is formally validated against some crucial properties defined via
proper temporal logic formulae. The model is then exploited to find an
assignment for the synaptical weights of neural networks such that they can
reproduce a given behaviour. The core of this approach consists in identifying
some correcting actions adjusting synaptical weights and back-propagating them

the BB power spectrum is not consistent with the 'canonical' tensor-to-scalar

The bandwidth is particularly paramount for GPU workloads such as 3D Gaming,
Imaging and Perceptual Computing, GPGPU due to their data-intensive nature. As
the number of threads and data streams in the GPUs increases with each
generation, along with a high available memory bandwidth, memory efficiency is
also crucial in order to achieve desired performance. In presence of multiple
concurrent data streams, the inherent locality in a single data stream is often
lost as these streams are interleaved while moving through multiple levels of
memory system. In DRAM based main memory, the poor request locality reduces
row-buffer reuse resulting in underutilized and inefficient memory bandwidth.
  In this paper we propose Memory-Aware Reordered Source (\textit{MARS})
architecture to address memory inefficiency arising from highly interleaved
data streams. The key idea of \textit{MARS} is that with a sufficiently large
lookahead before the main memory, data streams can be reordered based on their
row-buffer address to regain the lost locality and improve memory efficiency.
We show that \textit{MARS} improves achieved memory bandwidth by 11\% for a set
of synthetic microbenchmarks. Moreover, MARS does so without any specific
knowledge of the memory configuration.

We argue that a TM, or any other computation model, has no significance if its

the interpreter in the model definition sheds light on some of the difficult
problems faced in computation and mathematics. We provide an analytic process
framework to address this limitation. The framework can be overlaid on existing
concepts of computation to address many practical and philosophical concerns
such as the P vs NP problem. In addition, we argue that the P vs NP problem is
reminiscent of existing computation model which does not account for the person
that initiates the computation and interprets the intermediate and final
output. We utilize the observation that deterministic computational procedures
lack fundamental capacity to fully simulate their non-deterministic variant to
conclude that the set NP cannot be fully contained in P. Deterministic
procedure can approximate non-deterministic variant to some degree. However,
the logical implication of the fundamental differences between determinism and
non-determinism is that equivalence of the two classes is impossible to
establish.

  Breaking, and Defaults as Dissipative Instantons","Improved presentation, typos fixed. 51 pages, 8 figures",,,,"q-fin.ST q-fin.MF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a simple non-equilibrium model of a financial market as an open
system with a possible exchange of money with an outside world and market
frictions (trade impacts) incorporated into asset price dynamics via a feedback
mechanism. Using a linear market impact model, this produces a non-linear
two-parametric extension of the classical Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)
model, that we call the ""Quantum Equilibrium-Disequilibrium"" (QED) model. The
QED model gives rise to non-linear mean-reverting dynamics, broken scale
invariance, and corporate defaults. In the simplest one-stock (1D) formulation,
our parsimonious model has only one degree of freedom, yet calibrates to both
equity returns and credit default swap spreads. Defaults and market crashes are
associated with dissipative tunneling events, and correspond to instanton
(saddle-point) solutions of the model. When market frictions and
inflows/outflows of money are neglected altogether, ""classical"" GBM
scale-invariant dynamics with an exponential asset growth and without defaults
are formally recovered from the QED dynamics. However, we argue that this is
only a formal mathematical limit, and in reality the GBM limit is non-analytic
due to non-linear effects that produce both defaults and divergence of
perturbation theory in a small market friction parameter.

Cobalt valence tautomers (VT), molecules where a low-spin (LS) to high-spin

investigated complex, a LS-Co(III) ion bound to a dinegative organic ligand can
be reversibly converted into the HS-Co(II) bound to a mononegative one. By
combining magnetization measurements with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and
Muon Spin Relaxation ({\mu}SR), we have investigated the static magnetic
properties and the spin dynamics as a function of the temperature. Moreover,
the effect of the external pressure as well as of the infrared light
irradiation have been explored through magnetometry and NMR measurements to
determine the spin dynamics of the HS state. The photoinduced HS state, which
can have a lifetime of several hours below 30 K, is characterized by spin
dynamics in the MHz range, which persist at least down to 10 K. The application
of an external pressure causes a progressive increase of the LS-HS crossover,
which reaches room temperature for pressures around 10 kbar.

analogous to phenomena seen in quantum physics and electromagnetics, such as
immunity from back-scattering and unidirectional band gaps, which could lead to
the design of direction-dependent acoustic devices. One way to break
reciprocity is by spatiotemporally modulating material properties, which breaks
parity and time-reversal symmetries. In this work, we present a model for a
medium in which a slow, nonlinear deformation modulates the effective material
properties for small, overlaid disturbances (often referred to as
'small-on-large' propagation). The medium is modeled as a discrete spring-mass
chain that undergoes large deformation via prescribed displacements of certain
points in the unit cell. A multiple-scale perturbation analysis shows that, for
sufficiently slow modulations, the small-scale waves can be described by a
linear, monatomic chain with time- and space-dependent on-site stiffness. The
modulation depth can be tuned by changing the geometric and stiffness
parameters of the unit cell. The accuracy of the small-on-large approximation
is demonstrated using direct numerical simulations.

it is not doable in satisfactory time by even the most skillful operators.
Systems and their architecture change very rapidly in response to business and
user demand. Many organizations see value in the maintenance and management
model of NoOps that stands for No Operations. One of the implementations of
this model is a system that is maintained automatically without any human
intervention. The path to NoOps involves not only precise and fast diagnostics
but also reusing as much knowledge as possible after the system is reconfigured
or changed. The biggest challenge is to leverage knowledge on one IT system and
reuse this knowledge for diagnostics of another, different system. We propose a
framework of weighted graphs which can transfer knowledge, and perform
high-quality diagnostics of IT systems. We encode all possible data in a graph
representation of a system state and automatically calculate weights of these
graphs. Then, thanks to the evaluation of similarity between graphs, we
transfer knowledge about failures from one system to another and use it for
diagnostics. We successfully evaluate the proposed approach on Spark, Hadoop,
Kafka and Cassandra systems.
