data such as images, but face tremendous challenges in learning from more
generic data such as graphs. In CNNs, the trainable local filters enable the
automatic extraction of high-level features. The computation with filters
requires a fixed number of ordered units in the receptive fields. However, the
number of neighboring units is neither fixed nor are they ordered in generic
graphs, thereby hindering the applications of convolutional operations. Here,
we address these challenges by proposing the learnable graph convolutional
layer (LGCL). LGCL automatically selects a fixed number of neighboring nodes
for each feature based on value ranking in order to transform graph data into
grid-like structures in 1-D format, thereby enabling the use of regular
convolutional operations on generic graphs. To enable model training on
large-scale graphs, we propose a sub-graph training method to reduce the
excessive memory and computational resource requirements suffered by prior
methods on graph convolutions. Our experimental results on node classification
tasks in both transductive and inductive learning settings demonstrate that our
methods can achieve consistently better performance on the Cora, Citeseer,
Pubmed citation network, and protein-protein interaction network datasets. Our

contains a correlated hopping term where the density occupation strongly
modifies the hopping strength. Focusing on half filling, in addition to the
charge and spin density wave phases, large regions of ferromagnetic phase and
phase separation are discovered in the weakly interacting regime. The mechanism
of this ferromagnetism is attributed to the correlated hopping because the
hopping strength within a ferromagnetic domain is normalized to a larger value
than the hopping strength across the domain. Thus, the kinetic energy favors a
large ferromagnetic domain and consequently drives the system into a
ferromagnetic phase. We note that this is a different mechanism in contrast to
the well-known Stoner mechanism for ferromagnetism where the ferromagnetism is
driven by interaction energy.

photon emission from a linear chain of identical equidistant two-level atoms.
We selectively excite one of the atoms by a resonant laser field. The atoms are
coupled to each other via the dipole-dipole interaction and collective
spontaneous emission. Our attention is focused on the simultaneous observation
of correlated pairs of photons. It is found that the interference between the
emitting atoms can result in a highly directional emission of photon pairs.
These pairs of photons posses strong correlations and their emission is highly
concentrated into specific detection directions. We demonstrate the crucial
role of the selective coherent excitation in such a geometrical configuration.
Shifting the driving field from an atom located at one end of the chain to the
other causes the radiation pattern to flip to the opposite half of the
detection plane. Furthermore, we find that atomic systems in which only an atom
situated at a particular position within the linear chain is driven by a laser
field can radiate correlated twin photons in directions along which the
radiation of single photons is significantly reduced. Alternatively,
superbunching in the emitted photon statistics preferentially occurs in
directions of negligible or vanishing single photon emission. The effect of
superbunching strengthens as more emitters are added to the chain. Depending on
the number of atoms and the position of the driven atom within the chain, the
strongly correlated pairs of photons can be emitted into well-defined single,
two or four directions.

entanglement entropy and the geometry of spacetime. One such connection is the
ability to derive gravitational field equations from entanglement identities. I
will discuss a specific derivation of the Einstein equation from an equilibrium
condition satisfied by entanglement entropy, and explore a subtlety in the
construction when the matter fields are not conformally invariant. As a further
generalization, I extend the argument to include higher curvature theories of
gravity, whose consideration is necessitated by the presence of subleading
divergences in the entanglement entropy beyond the area law.
  A deeper issue in this construction, as well as in more general
considerations identifying black hole entropy with entanglement entropy, is
that the entropy is ambiguous for gauge fields and gravitons. The ambiguity
stems from how one handles edge modes at the entangling surface, which
parameterize the gauge transformations that are broken by the presence of the
boundary. The final part of this thesis is devoted to identifying the edge
modes in arbitrary diffeomorphism-invariant theories. Edge modes are
conjectured to provide a statistical description of the black hole entropy, and
this work takes some initial steps toward checking this conjecture in higher
curvature theories.

rearranges an $n$-letter string into runs of identical characters (by
exploiting context regularities), resulting in highly compressible strings, and
is the basis of the \texttt{bzip} compression program. Alas, the decoding
process of BWT is inherently sequential and requires $\Omega(n)$ time even to
retrieve a \emph{single} character.
  We study the succinct data structure problem of locally decoding short
substrings of a given text under its \emph{compressed} BWT, i.e., with small
additive redundancy $r$ over the \emph{Move-To-Front} (\texttt{bzip})
compression. The celebrated BWT-based FM-index (FOCS '00), as well as other
related literature, yield a trade-off of $r=\tilde{O}(n/\sqrt{t})$ bits, when a
single character is to be decoded in $O(t)$ time. We give a near-quadratic
improvement $r=\tilde{O}(n\lg(t)/t)$. As a by-product, we obtain an
\emph{exponential} (in $t$) improvement on the redundancy of the FM-index for
counting pattern-matches on compressed text. In the interesting regime where
the text compresses to $n^{1-o(1)}$ bits, these results provide an $\exp(t)$
\emph{overall} space reduction. For the local decoding problem of BWT, we also
prove an $\Omega(n/t^2)$ cell-probe lower bound for ""symmetric"" data

Move-to-Front (MTF) code: with only $O(1)$ extra bits per block of length
$n^{\Omega(1)}$, the decoding time of a single character can be decreased from
$\Omega(n)$ to $O(\lg n)$. This result is of independent interest in
algorithmic information theory.

frameworks leading to bi-cluster flocking in which two sub-ensembles evolve to
two-clusters departing from each other. In previous literature, the interaction
problem has been studied in the context of attractive couplings. In our
interaction problem, inter-ensemble and intra-ensemble couplings are assumed to
be repulsive and attractive respectively. When the Rayleigh frictional forces
are turned on, we show that the total kinetic energy is uniformly bounded so
that spatially mixed initial configurations evolve toward the bi-cluster
configuration asymptotically fast under some suitable conditions on system
parameters, communication weight functions and initial configurations. In
contrast, when Rayleigh frictional forces are turned off, the flocking analysis
is more delicate mainly due to the possibility of an exponential growth of the
kinetic energy. In this case, we employ two mutually disjoint frameworks with
constant inter-ensemble communication function and exponentially localized
inter-ensemble communication functions respectively, and prove the
bi-clustering phenomenon in both cases. This work extends the previous work on

Tidal Disruption Event has been published. In order to explore the sensitivity
of GSA, we performed an independent and systematic search for nuclear
transients using Gaia observations. Our transient search is driven from an
input galaxy catalogue (derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Release 12).
We present a candidate detection metric which is independent from the existing
GSA methodology, to see if Gaia Alerts are biased against the discovery of
nuclear transients, and in particular which steps may have an impact. Our
technique does require significant manual vetting of candidates, making
implementation in the GSA system impractical for daily operations, although it
could be run weekly, which for month-to-year long transients would make a
scientifically valuable addition. Our search yielded ~480 nuclear transients, 5
of which were alerted and published by GSA. The list of (in some cases ongoing)
transients includes candidates for events related to enhanced accretion onto a
super-massive black hole and TDEs. An implementation of the detection
methodology and criteria used in this paper as an extension of GSA could open
up the possibility for Gaia to fulfil the role as a main tool to find transient
nuclear activity as predicted in the literature.

to matter effect when active neutrinos propagate through terrestrial matter. In

phases in lepton mixing matrix make the interaction complicated formally. In
this work, the exact analytical expressions for active neutrino oscillation
probabilities in terrestrial matter, including sterile neutrino contribution,
are derived. It is pointed out that this set of formulas contain information
both in matter and in vacuum, and can be easily tuned by choosing related
parameters. Based on the generic exact formulas, we present oscillation

strangeness, and charge) can be used to probe phases of strongly interacting
QCD matter and the possible existence of a critical point in the phase diagram.
The cumulants of the multiplicity distributions related to these conserved
quantities are expected to be sensitive to possible increased fluctuations near
a critical point and ratios of the cumulants can be directly compared to the
ratios of the susceptibilities from Lattice QCD calculations. In these
proceedings, the measurements of the cumulants of net-proton multiplicity
distributions from Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6,

by the STAR experiment at RHIC will be presented. Multi-particle correlation
functions will also be presented.
  The measurement of higher-order cumulants are sensitive to experimental
artifacts. Current efficiency correction methods are based on the assumption
that the tracking efficiency is strictly binomial. An unfolding technique is
used to account for multiplicity dependent detector responses and efficiency
variations. A large sample of AMPT events will be used to check the validity of
the unfolding technique. The comparison of the various correction approaches
should provide important guidance towards a reliable experimental determination

problem with the Plackett-Luce (PL) subset choice model--an online learning
framework where at each trial the learner chooses a subset of $k$ arms from a
fixed set of $n$ arms, and subsequently observes a stochastic feedback
indicating preference information of the items in the chosen subset, e.g., the
most preferred item or ranking of the top $m$ most preferred items etc. The
objective is to identify a near-best item in the underlying PL model with high
confidence. This generalizes the well-studied PAC \emph{Dueling-Bandit} problem
over $n$ arms, which aims to recover the \emph{best-arm} from pairwise
preference information, and is known to require $O(\frac{n}{\epsilon^2} \ln
\frac{1}{\delta})$ sample complexity \citep{Busa_pl,Busa_top}. We study the
sample complexity of this problem under various feedback models: (1) Winner of
the subset (WI), and (2) Ranking of top-$m$ items (TR) for $2\le m \le k$. We
show, surprisingly, that with winner information (WI) feedback over subsets of
size $2 \leq k \leq n$, the best achievable sample complexity is still $O\left(
\frac{n}{\epsilon^2} \ln \frac{1}{\delta}\right)$, independent of $k$, and the
same as that in the Dueling Bandit setting ($k=2$). For the more general
top-$m$ ranking (TR) feedback model, we show a significantly smaller lower
bound on sample complexity of $\Omega\bigg( \frac{n}{m\epsilon^2} \ln
\frac{1}{\delta}\bigg)$, which suggests a multiplicative reduction by a factor
${m}$ owing to the additional information revealed from preferences among $m$
items instead of just $1$. We also propose two algorithms for the PAC problem
with the TR feedback model with optimal (upto logarithmic factors) sample
complexity guarantees, establishing the increase in statistical efficiency from
exploiting rank-ordered feedback.

her beliefs over consumption and money. We introduce news utility into
otherwise classical static Bayesian mechanism design models. We show that a key
role is played by the timeline of the mechanism, i.e. whether there are delays
between the announcement stage, the participation stage, the play stage and the
realization stage of a mechanism. Depending on the timing, agents with news
utility can experience two additional news utility effects: a surprise effect
derived from comparing to pre-mechanism beliefs, as well as a realization
effect derived from comparing post-play beliefs with the actual outcome of the
mechanism.
  We look at two distinct mechanism design settings reflecting the two main
strands of the classical literature. In the first model, a monopolist screens
an agent according to the magnitude of her loss aversion. In the second model,
we consider a general multi-agent Bayesian mechanism design setting where the
uncertainty of each player stems from not knowing the intrinsic types of the
other agents. We give applications to auctions and public good provision which
illustrate how news utility changes classical results.
  For both models we characterize the optimal design of the timeline. A
timeline featuring no delay between participation and play but a delay in
realization is never optimal in either model. In the screening model the
optimal timeline is one without delays. In auction settings, under fairly
natural assumptions the optimal timeline has delays between all three stages of
the mechanism.

around the laser propagation axis. Thus, the accelerating electrons that are
focused on axis often execute small transverse oscillations. In this Article,
we propose a simple scheme to break this symmetry, which enhances the
transverse wiggling of electrons and boosts the betatron radiation emission.
Through 3D particle-in-cell simulations, we show that sending the laser with a
small angle of incidence on a transverse plasma density gradient generates an
asymmetric wakefield. It first provokes injection and then increases the
wiggling of the electrons through the transverse shifting of the wakefield axis
which occurs when the laser pulse leaves the gradient. Consequently, we show
that the radiated energy per unit of charge can increase by a factor $>20$ when
using this scheme, and that the critical energy of the radiation quintuples
compared with a reference case without the transverse density gradient.

decade, with many new classification approaches published each year. The
research focus has mostly been on improving the accuracy and efficiency of
classifiers, while their interpretability has been somewhat neglected.
Classifier interpretability has become a critical constraint for many
application domains and the introduction of the 'right to explanation' GDPR EU
legislation in May 2018 is likely to further emphasize the importance of
explainable learning algorithms. In this work we analyse the state-of-the-art
for time series classification, and propose new algorithms that aim to maintain
the classifier accuracy and efficiency, but keep interpretability as a key
design constraint. We present new time series classification algorithms that
advance the state-of-the-art by implementing the following three key ideas: (1)
Multiple resolutions of symbolic approximations: we combine symbolic
representations obtained using different parameters; (2) Multiple domain
representations: we combine symbolic approximations in time (e.g., SAX) and
frequency (e.g., SFA) domains; (3) Efficient navigation of a huge
symbolic-words space: we adapt a symbolic sequence classifier named SEQL, to
make it work with multiple domain representations (e.g., SAX-SEQL, SFA-SEQL),
and use its greedy feature selection strategy to effectively filter the best
features for each representation. We show that a multi-resolution multi-domain
linear classifier, SAX-SFA-SEQL, achieves a similar accuracy to the
state-of-the-art COTE ensemble, and to a recent deep learning method (FCN), but
uses a fraction of the time required by either COTE or FCN. We discuss the
accuracy, efficiency and interpretability of our proposed algorithms. To
further analyse the interpretability aspect of our classifiers, we present a

obtaining a two-dimensional (2D) material with the Cairo tessellation from the

speaking, not belonging to the Cairo tessellation, we find that single-layer
PtP$_2$ is completely planar exhibiting dynamically stable phonon modes. We
also observe a reduction in the bandgaps PtP$_2$ from bulk to single layer
using the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid density functional, and the
bandgap type switches from indirect to direct. By contrast, using the standard
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional leads to the conclusion of single-layer
PtP$_2$ being metallic. We further study the bonding characteristics of this
novel single-layer material by computing the Bader charge transfer, the
electron localization function, and the crystal orbit overlap population, which
show mixed P-P covalent bonding and Pt-P ionic bonding, with the former being
stronger. Finally, we study the surface states of single-layer PtP$_2$ and
consider the spin-orbit coupling. We observe no spin-helical Dirac cone states,
therefore ruling out single-layer PtP$_2$ as a topological insulator. We expect
the example demonstrated in this work will stimulate interest in

  with Network Effects","31 pages, submitted for possible journal publication",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mobile data demand is increasing tremendously in wireless social networks,
and thus an efficient pricing scheme for social-enabled services is urgently
needed. Though static pricing is dominant in the actual data market, price
intuitively ought to be dynamically changed to yield greater revenue. The
critical question is how to design the optimal dynamic pricing scheme, with
prospects for maximizing the expected long-term revenue. In this paper, we
study the sequential dynamic pricing scheme of a monopoly mobile network
operator in the social data market. In the market, the operator, i.e., the
seller, individually offers each mobile user, i.e., the buyer, a certain price
in multiple time periods dynamically and repeatedly. The proposed scheme
exploits the network effects in the mobile users' behaviors that boost the
social data demand. Furthermore, due to limited radio resource, the impact of
wireless network congestion is taken into account in the pricing scheme.
Thereafter, we propose a modified sequential pricing policy in order to ensure
social fairness among mobile users in terms of their individual utilities. We
analytically demonstrate that the proposed sequential dynamic pricing scheme
can help the operator gain greater revenue and mobile users achieve higher
total utilities than those of the baseline static pricing scheme. To gain more
insights, we further study a simultaneous dynamic pricing scheme in which the
operator determines the pricing strategy at the beginning of each time period.
Mobile users decide on their individual data demand in each time period
simultaneously, considering the network effects in the social domain and the
congestion effects in the network domain. We construct the social graph using
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER) model and the real dataset based social network for
performance evaluation.

control theory while being highly important for various applications. To attack
such problems with constrained measurable controls, we develop a refined method

convergence. This approach, married to advanced tools of first-order and
second-order variational analysis and generalized differentiations, allows us
to derive adequate collections of necessary optimality conditions for local

it from insider or outsider attacks. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is one of
the most effective ways to enhance vehicle security on the insecure CAN bus
protocol. We propose a new IDS based on the entropy of the identifier bits in
CAN messages. The key observation is that all the known CAN message injection
attacks need to alter the CAN ID bits and analyzing the entropy of such bits
can be an effective way to detect those attacks. We collected real CAN messages
from a vehicle (2016 Ford Fusion) and performed simulated message injection
attacks. The experimental results showed that our entropy based IDS can
successfully detect all the injection attacks without disrupting the
communication on CAN.

graphene with vacancies can be traced to electrons partially filling
$sp^{2*}$-antibonding and $p_z^*$-nonbonding states, which are induced by the
vacancies and appear near the Fermi level. Because the spatial wavefunctions of
the both states are composed of atomic orbitals in an antisymmetric
configuration, their spin wavefunctions should be symmetric according to the
electron exchange antisymmetric principle, leading to electrons partially
filling these states in spin polarization. Since this $p_z^*$ state originates
not from interactions between the atoms but from the unpaired $p_z$ orbitals
due to the removal of $p_z$ orbitals on the minority sublattice, the $p_z^*$
state is constrained, distributed on the atoms of the majority sublattice, and
decays gradually from the vacancy as $\sim$ $1/r$. According to these
characteristics, we concluded that the $p_z^*$ state plays a critical role in
magnetic ordering in graphene with vacancies. If the vacancy concentration in
graphene is large enough to cause the decay-length regions to overlap,
constraining the $p_z^*$ orbital components as little as possible on the
minority sublattice atoms in the overlap regions results in the vacancy-induced
$p_z^*$ states being coherent. The coherent process in the overlap region leads
to the wavefunctions in all the involved regions antisymmetrized, consequently
causing ferromagnetism according to the electron exchange antisymmetric
principle. This unusual mechanism concerned with the origin of $sp$-electron
magnetism and magnetic ordering has never before been reported and is
distinctly different from conventional mechanisms.

  Clustering","17 pages,3 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Image clustering is to group a set of images into disjoint clusters in a way
that images in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in
other clusters, which is an unsupervised or semi-supervised learning process.
It is a crucial and challenging task in machine learning and computer vision.
The performances of existing image clustering methods have close relations with
features used for clustering, even if unsupervised coding based methods have
improved the performances a lot. To reduce the effect of clustering features,
we propose a feature-weak-relevant method for image clustering. The proposed
method converts an unsupervised clustering process into an alternative
iterative process of unsupervised learning and transfer learning. The
clustering process firstly starts up from handcrafted features based image
clustering to estimate an initial label for every image, and secondly use a
proposed sampling strategy to choose images with reliable labels to feed a
transfer-learning model to learn representative features that can be used for
next round of unsupervised learning. In this manner, image clustering is
iteratively optimized. What's more, the handcrafted features are used to boot
up the clustering process, and just have a little effect on the final
performance; therefore, the proposed method is feature-weak-relevant.
Experimental results on six kinds of public available datasets show that the
proposed method outperforms state of the art methods and depends less on the
employed features at the same time.

discoveries suggest that the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an

required step in cancer metastasis. Although there are many indications showing
the connections between metastasis and stem cell, researches often studied them
separately or at most bi-laterally, not in an integrated way. In this study, we
aim at exploring the global mechanisms and interrelationship among cancer,
development and metastasis which are currently poorly understood. To start, we
constructed a core gene regulatory network motif which contain specific genes
and microRNAs of CSC, EMT and cancer. We uncovered seven distinct states
emerged from the underlying landscape. They are identified as Normal,
Premalignant, Cancer, stem cell (SC), cancer stem cell (CSC), Lesion and
Hyperlasia state. Given the biological definition of each state, we also
discussed the metastasis ability of each state. We show how and which types of
cells can be transformed to a cancer state and the connections among cancer,
CSC and EMT. The barrier height and flux of the kinetic paths are explored to
quantify how and which cells switch stochastically between the states. Our
landscape model provides a quantitative way which reveals the global mechanisms
of cancer, development and metastasis.

diffusive propagation of light in an amplifying medium with randomly suspended
resonant scatterers. The simulation shows that a more efficient and stable
coherent random lasing can be achieved with monodisperse scatterers having
amplification in the intra-scatterer region. To realize that experimentally,
the array of amplifying microdroplets is created using a vibrating orifice
droplet generator. The degree of randomness is tuned by varying the size and
spacing between the droplets. Upon optical excitation, coherent random lasing
is observed in the longitudinal direction of the array. By making the droplets
monodisperse, we realized amplifying periodic-on-average random superlattice
(aPARS) system. The statistical study of the lasing wavelengths from aPARS
droplet array shows that the lasing peaks occur only within a specific interval
of wavelengths. Using spectral mode-matching, we restrict the frequency
fluctuation of modes within ~ 1.2 nm. The calculation based on the transfer
matrix method shows that experimentally observed lasing peaks arise from the
perturbed band-edge states of the underlying periodic system. The spatial
intensity distribution of the lasing modes in droplet array confirms its
Anderson-localized nature. We also consider the microdroplet array as a
direct-coupled active chain of spherical microcavities and examine the ability
of gain to overcome the bending and other radiative losses.

Eighty-five percent of 303 MCs contain a south Bz up to 50 nT. Sheath Bz during

magnitude and Bz south occur in the declining phase of the solar cycle. The

the upper limit, the so called ""maximum drag reduction"" (MDR) asymptote is
universal, i.e. independent of the type of polymer and solvent used. Until
recently, the consensus was that, in this limit, flows are in a marginal state
where only a minimal level of turbulence activity persists. Observations in
direct numerical simulations using minimal sized channels appeared to support
this view and reported long ""hibernation"" periods where turbulence is
marginalized. In simulations of pipe flow we find that, indeed, with increasing
Weissenberg number (Wi), turbulence expresses long periods of hibernation if
the domain size is small. However, with increasing pipe length, the temporal
hibernation continuously alters to spatio-temporal intermittency and here the
flow consists of turbulent puffs surrounded by laminar flow. Moreover, upon an
increase in Wi, the flow fully relaminarises, in agreement with recent
experiments. At even larger Wi, a different instability is encountered causing
a drag increase towards MDR. Our findings hence link earlier minimal flow unit
simulations with recent experiments and confirm that the addition of polymers
initially suppresses Newtonian turbulence and leads to a reverse transition.
The MDR state on the other hand results from a separate instability and the
underlying dynamics corresponds to the recently proposed state of
elasto-inertial-turbulence (EIT).

features that are absent in normal liquids, such as non-exponential relaxation
and a strong temperature-dependence of the relaxation time. Connecting these
dynamic properties to the microscopic structure of the system is very
challenging because of the presence of the structural disorder. Here we use
computer simulations of a metallic glass-former to establish such a connection.
By probing the temperature and wave-vector dependence of the intermediate
scattering function we find that the relaxation dynamics of the glassy melt is
directly related to the local arrangement of icosahedral structures: Isolated
icosahedra give rise to a flow-like stretched exponential relaxation whereas
clusters of icosahedra lead to a compressed exponential relaxation that is
reminiscent to the one found in a solid. Our results show that in metallic
glass-formers these two types of relaxation processes can coexist and give rise
to a surprisingly complex dynamics, insight that will allow to get a deeper
understanding of the outstanding mechanical properties of metallic glasses.

centre in diamond have emerged as promising candidates to characterise
ultra-thin and 2D materials. An outstanding challenge to this goal is isolating
the contribution of 2D materials from undesired contributions arising from
surface contamination, and changes to the diamond surface induced by the sample
or transfer process. Here we report on such a scenario, in which the abrasive
deposition of trace amounts of materials onto a diamond gives rise to a
previously unreported source of magnetic noise. By deliberately scratching the
diamond surface with macroscopic blocks of various metals (Fe, Cu, Cr, Au), we
are able to form ultra-thin structures (i.e. with thicknesses down to
$<1$\,nm), and find that these structures give rise to a broadband source of
noise. Explanation for these effects are discussed, including spin and charge
noise native to the sample and/or induced by sample-surface interactions, and
indirect effects, where the deposited material affects the charge stability and
magnetic environment of the sensing layer. This work illustrates the high
sensitivity of NV noise spectroscopy to ultra-thin materials down to sub-nm
regimes -- a key step towards the study of 2D electronic systems -- and
highlights the need to passivate the diamond surface for future sensing
applications in ultra-thin and 2D materials.

regulate distortion of a perovskite compound LaFeO3 driven solely by reduced
graphene oxide (RGO) and to demonstrate the effect using a critical parameter -
electrochemical conductivity. A series of graphene concentration varied
nanocomposites were synthesized via hydrothermal method. The crystal distortion
is investigated using X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement. By analysis of
the oxygen and Fe ion peaks of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, along with
Raman spectra, a clear understanding of the distortion process is developed.
The remarkable effect of distortion on dispersed phases generated by graphene
matrix is coined with a new phrase Graphenostortion. The study revealed that
the environment for the graphenostrotion originated from the interaction of
oxygen functional groups of RGO with LaFeO3. The variation in bond covalency
influenced by the percentage concentration of non-lattice oxygen, distorted the
Pbnm geometry of the graphene nanocomposite. The developed mechanism for
distortion is in good agreement with electrochemical activity studies. RGO as a
tool to control distortion in metal oxide could facilitate new facets in
technological applications of graphene nanocomposites.

microchannel under the presence of a uniform electric field. Towards
investigating the non-trivial electrohydrodynamics of a compound droplet,
confined in between two parallel plate electrodes, a phase field approach has
been adopted. Under the assumption of negligible fluid inertia and small shape
deformation, an asymptotic model is also developed to predict the transient as
well as the steady state droplet dynamics in the limiting case of an unbounded
suspending medium. The phases involved are either assumed to be perfect
dielectric or leaky dielectric. Subsequent investigation shows that shape
deformation of either of the interfaces of the droplet increase with rise in
the channel confinement for a perfect dielectric system. However, for a leaky
dielectric system, the deformation of inner droplet and outer droplet can
increase or decrease with the rise in channel confinement depending on the
electric properties (conductivity and permittivity) of the system. The present
study further takes into account the effect of eccentricity of the inner
droplet. Depending on the relative magnitude of the permittivity and
conductivity of the system, the inner droplet, if eccentrically located, may
exhibit a to and fro or a simple translational motion. It is seen that increase
in the channel confinement results in a translational motion of the inner
droplet thus rendering its motion independent of any electrical properties.
Since the compound droplet model approximately mimics the structure of a cell,
the current investigation is expected to provide a significant impact towards
predicting the effect of an externally imposed electrical field on the dynamics
of a cell in any fluidic confinement and hence has the potential towards
widespread applications in the field of medical diagnostics.

KINASE KINASE 2 (MKK2) and/or MKK1 became rapidly phosphorylated in

strength of our approach is its robustness: we enumerate four families $F_1

also solved \emph{via} a succession rule, which however does not generalize the
one for $F_4$. The associated enumeration sequence, which we call the
\emph{powered Catalan numbers}, is quite intriguing, and further investigated.
We provide two different succession rules for it, denoted $\Omega_{pCat}$ and
$\Omega_{steady}$, and show that they define two types of families enumerated
by powered Catalan numbers. Among such families, we introduce the \emph{steady
paths}, which are naturally associated with $\Omega_{steady}$. They allow us to
bridge the gap between the two types of families enumerated by powered Catalan
numbers: indeed, we provide a size-preserving bijection between steady paths
and valley-marked Dyck paths (which are naturally associated with
$\Omega_{pCat}$).
  Along the way, we provide several nice connections to families of
permutations defined by the avoidance of vincular patterns, and some
enumerative conjectures.

a new update within any bounded time interval by using local information
available from its in-neighbors. ""Exact"" means that every node of the AsySPA
can asymptotically converge to the same optimal solution, even under different
update rates among nodes and bounded communication delays. To address uneven
update rates, we design a simple mechanism to adaptively adjust stepsizes per

Then, we construct a delay-free augmented system to address asynchrony and

algorithm, which clearly has its own significance and helps us to explicitly
evaluate the convergence rate of the AsySPA. Finally, we demonstrate advantages
of the AsySPA in both theory and simulation.

large sparse linear systems of algebraic equations have to be solved. We
analyse this approach and show a sufficient condition on the error to meet the

that the centre of the isophotal fitting to the nuclear region of M87 -assumed

the major displacements measured coincide with a powerful outburst that took
place between 2003 and 2007, where there was a flux increment in the nucleus
and the first knot of the jet. After the outburst, the isophotal centre remains
stable and is consistent with the AGN location. This suggests that the
displacements are artificially caused by a flux variation in the galaxy and
that the SMBH actually resides in the equilibrium position. We caution about
the determination of the galaxy photocentre by isophotal fitting in cases of
nuclear variability and/or presence of photometric irregularities, and advise a
long-term temporal analysis of the results to confirm possible displaced SMBHs.

a novel radical analysis network with densely connected architecture (DenseRAN)

attention mechanism. The manner of treating a Chinese character as a
composition of two-dimensional structures and radicals can reduce the size of

Chinese character classes, only if the corresponding radicals have been seen in
training set. Evaluated on ICDAR-2013 competition database, the proposed
approach significantly outperforms whole-character modeling approach with a
relative character error rate (CER) reduction of 18.54%. Meanwhile, for the
case of recognizing 3277 unseen Chinese characters in CASIA-HWDB1.2 database,
DenseRAN can achieve a character accuracy of about 41% while the traditional

regions we estimate the size and nonpotentiality. We compute the total magnetic
reconnection flux at the source regions of CMEs using the post-eruption arcade
method. By forward modeling the CMEs we find their deprojected geometric
parameters and constrain their kinematics and magnetic properties. Based on an
analysis of this database we report that the correlation between CME speed and
their source active region size and global nonpotentiality is weak, but not
negligible. We find the near-Sun velocity and kinetic energy of CMEs to be well
correlated with the associated magnetic reconnection flux. We establish a
statistically significant empirical relationship between the CME speed and
reconnection flux that may be utilized for prediction purposes. Furthermore, we
find CME kinematics to be related with the axial magnetic field intensity and
relative magnetic helicity of their intrinsic flux ropes. The amount of coronal
magnetic helicity shed by CMEs is found to be well correlated with their
near-Sun speeds. The kinetic energy of CMEs is well correlated with their
intrinsic magnetic energy density. Our results constrain processes related to

high-magnification optical imaging technique that provides in vivo and in situ
cellular-level imaging for real-time assessment of tissue pathology.
Endomicroscopy could potentially be used for intraoperative surgical guidance,
but it is challenging to assess a surgical site using individual microscopic
images due to the limited field-of-view and difficulties associated with
manually manipulating the probe.
  Methods: In this paper, a novel robotic device for large-area endomicroscopy
imaging is proposed, demonstrating a rapid, but highly accurate, scanning
mechanism with image-based motion control which is able to generate
histology-like endomicroscopy mosaics. The device also includes, for the first
time in robotic-assisted endomicroscopy, the capability to ablate tissue
without the need for an additional tool.
  Results: The device achieves pre-programmed trajectories with positioning
accuracy of less than 30 um, while the image-based approach demonstrated that
it can suppress random motion disturbances up to 1.25 mm/s. Mosaics are
presented from a range of ex vivo human and animal tissues, over areas of more
than 3 mm^2, scanned in approximate 10 seconds.
  Conclusion: This work demonstrates the potential of the proposed instrument
to generate large-area, high-resolution microscopic images for intraoperative
tissue identification and margin assessment.
  Significance: This approach presents an important alternative to current
histology techniques, significantly reducing the tissue assessment time, while
simultaneously providing the capability to mark and ablate suspicious areas
intraoperatively.

Higgs models based on a variety of coset spaces $G/H$ and discuss their

with substantially differing consequences for phenomenology. The first type of
term (which appears in the minimal model based on $SO(5)/SO(4)$) is a field
theory generalization of the Aharonov-Bohm phase in quantum mechanics. The
phenomenological effects of such a term arise only at the non-perturbative
level, and lead to $P$ and $CP$ violation in the Higgs sector. The second type
of term (which appears in the model based on $SO(6)/SO(5)$) is a field theory
generalization of the Dirac monopole in quantum mechanics and has physical
effects even at the classical level. Perhaps most importantly, measuring the
coefficient of such a term can allow one to probe the structure of the
underlying microscopic theory. A particularly rich topological structure, with
6 distinct terms, is uncovered for the model based on $SO(6)/SO(4)$, containing
2 Higgs doublets and a singlet. Of the corresponding couplings, one is an
integer and one is a phase.

to iterative sequential algorithms: for many classic algorithms, the depth of
the dependence structure is now well understood, and scheduling techniques have
been developed to exploit this shallow dependence structure for efficient
parallel implementations. A related, applied research strand has studied
methods by which certain iterative task-based algorithms can be efficiently
parallelized via relaxed concurrent priority schedulers. These allow for high
concurrency when inserting and removing tasks, at the cost of executing
superfluous work due to the relaxed semantics of the scheduler.
  In this work, we take a step towards unifying these two research directions,
by showing that there exists a family of relaxed priority schedulers that can
efficiently and deterministically execute classic iterative algorithms such as
greedy maximal independent set (MIS) and matching. Our primary result shows
that, given a randomized scheduler with an expected relaxation factor of $k$ in
terms of the maximum allowed priority inversions on a task, and any graph on
$n$ vertices, the scheduler is able to execute greedy MIS with only an additive
factor of poly($k$) expected additional iterations compared to an exact (but
not scalable) scheduler. This counter-intuitive result demonstrates that the
overhead of relaxation when computing MIS is not dependent on the input size or
structure of the input graph. Experimental results show that this overhead can
be clearly offset by the gain in performance due to the highly scalable
scheduler. In sum, we present an efficient method to deterministically
parallelize iterative sequential algorithms, with provable runtime guarantees
in terms of the number of executed tasks to completion.

electron concentrations $0.6\lesssim\bar{n}\leq 1$ with $t$ the hopping
constant. The approach takes into account interactions of electrons with spin
and charge fluctuations of all ranges and fulfils the Mermin-Wagner theorem.
Temperature and concentration dependencies of the uniform magnetic
susceptibility, the variation of the double occupancy with the repulsion and
the temperature dependence of the square of the site spin are in satisfactory
agreement with Monte Carlo results. Three types of the temperature variation of
the electron energy spectrum can be distinguished at half-filling. For
$U\lesssim 3t$, at low temperatures, there are two nonintersecting bands, which
approach each other on the boundary of the magnetic Brillouin zone. With
increasing $T$ these bands merge into one band crossing the Fermi level. For
$4t\lesssim U \lesssim 6t$, the low-temperature picture described above is
supplemented with a low-intensity spin-polaron band located near the Fermi
level. As its counterpart in the strong-correlation case, the band is formed by
bound states of electrons and spin excitations. However, in contrast to the
former case, the band exists even at half-filling and occupies the entire
Brillouin zone. As for lower $U$, with increasing temperature, all bands
coalesce into a single band. For $U\gtrsim 7t$ and low temperatures the
spectrum has a pronounced four-band structure, which with increasing $T$
transforms into two Hubbard subbands.

there is one restriction: you are not allowed to use the same colour more than

number of different colours that you see after rolling the dice. How should you
colour the sides of the dice in order to maximize the Shannon entropy of $X$?
In this article we investigate this question. We show that the entropy of $X$

constant additive factor, in the case of there being equally many coins and

individuals embedded in those networks. One of the interesting phenomena driven
by such heterogeneities is the friendship paradox (FP), stating that the mean
degree of one's neighbors is larger than the degree of oneself. Alternatively,
one can use the median degree of neighbors as well as the fraction of neighbors
having a higher degree than oneself. Each of these reflects on how people
perceive their neighborhoods, i.e., their perception models, hence how they
feel peer pressure. In our paper, we study the impact of perception models on
the FP by comparing three versions of the perception model in networks
generated with a given degree distribution and a tunable degree-degree
correlation or assortativity. The increasing assortativity is expected to
decrease network-level peer pressure, while we find a nontrivial behavior only
for the mean-based perception model. By simulating opinion formation, in which
the opinion adoption probability of an individual is given as a function of
individual peer pressure, we find that it takes the longest time to reach
consensus when individuals adopt the median-based perception model, compared to
other versions. Our findings suggest that one needs to consider the proper
perception model for better modeling human behaviors and social dynamics.

topology. In the $1$-dimensional case a similar result was shown in
\cite{MS88,MOS89}.
  It is well-known that in more than one dimension solutions of this equation
are distribution-valued, and the equation has to be interpreted in a
renormalised sense. Formally, this renormalisation corresponds to moving the
minima of the potential infinitely far apart and making them infinitely deep.
We show that despite this renormalisation, solutions behave like perturbations
of the deterministic system without renormalisation: they spend large stretches
of time close to the minimisers of the (un-renormalised) potential and the
exponential contraction rate of different profiles is given by the second
derivative of the potential in these points.
  As an application we prove an Eyring--Kramers law for the transition times

found to be correlated with the gamma-ray emission at TeV energies during the
flaring activity of the source. The soft X-ray photon spectral index is
observed to be anti-correlated with the integral flux showing
harder-when-brighter behavior. An average value of 4.5% for V-band optical
polarization is obtained during the above period whereas the corresponding
electric vector position angle changes significantly. We have used the minimum
variability timescale from the H.E.S.S. observations to estimate the Doppler

another based on local rigidity and the so-called Maximum Depth Heuristics

a large number of points and adding more views in MDH-based NRSfM and
efficiently solve them with Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP). This does not
require any shape initialization and produces results orders of times faster

operator by minimizing the mutual information between the observations and the
state variables describing the grid. Simultaneously, the attacker aims to
minimize the probability of attack detection by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler
(KL) divergence between the distribution when the attack is present and the
distribution under normal operation. The resulting cost function is the
weighted sum of the mutual information and the KL divergence mentioned above.
The tradeoff between the probability of attack detection and the reduction of
mutual information is governed by the weighting parameter on the KL divergence
term in the cost function. The probability of attack detection is evaluated as
a function of the weighting parameter. A sufficient condition on the weighting
parameter is given for achieving an arbitrarily small probability of attack
detection. The attack performance is numerically assessed on the IEEE 30-Bus

To treat the underlying plaque deposits in the arterial walls, intravascular
optical coherence tomography can be used by experts to detect and characterize
the lesions. In clinical routine, hundreds of images are acquired for each
patient which requires automatic plaque detection for fast and accurate
decision support. So far, automatic approaches rely on classic machine learning
methods and deep learning solutions have rarely been studied. Given the success
of deep learning methods with other imaging modalities, a thorough
understanding of deep learning-based plaque detection for future clinical
decision support systems is required. We address this issue with a new dataset
consisting of in-vivo patient images labeled by three trained experts. Using
this dataset, we employ state-of-the-art deep learning models that directly
learn plaque classification from the images. For improved performance, we study
different transfer learning approaches. Furthermore, we investigate the use of
cartesian and polar image representations and employ data augmentation
techniques tailored to each representation. We fuse both representations in a
multi-path architecture for more effective feature exploitation. Last, we
address the challenge of plaque differentiation in addition to detection.
Overall, we find that our combined model performs best with an accuracy of
91.7%, a sensitivity of 90.9% and a specificity of 92.4%. Our results indicate
that building a deep learning-based clinical decision support system for plaque
detection is feasible.

circumvent the problem of ultraviolet divergences in quantum field theories. In
the IBC approach, particle creation and annihilation is described with the help
of linear conditions that relate the wave functions of two sectors of Fock
space: $\psi^{(n)}(p)$ at an interior point $p$ and $\psi^{(n+m)}(q)$ at a
boundary point $q$, typically a collision configuration. Here, we extend IBCs
to the relativistic case. To do this, we make use of Dirac's concept of
multi-time wave functions, i.e., wave functions $\psi(x_1,...,x_N)$ depending
on $N$ space-time coordinates $x_i$ for $N$ particles. This provides the
manifestly covariant particle-position representation that is required in the
IBC approach. In order to obtain rigorous results, we construct a model for
Dirac particles in 1+1 dimensions that can create or annihilate each other when
they meet. Our main results are an existence and uniqueness theorem for that
model, and the identification of a class of IBCs ensuring local probability
conservation on all Cauchy surfaces. Furthermore, we explain how these IBCs
relate to the usual formulation with creation and annihilation operators. The
Lorentz invariance is discussed and it is found that apart from a constant
matrix (which is required to transform in a certain way) the model is
manifestly Lorentz invariant. This makes it clear that the IBC approach can be
made compatible with relativity.

characters are studied on compact manifolds without boundary. The paper
consists of two parts: First the functional integral formulation based on zeta
function regularization is revisited and extended in order to provide a general
framework for further applications. A field theoretical model - called extended
higher-abelian Maxwell theory - is introduced, which is a higher-abelian
version of Maxwell theory of electromagnetism extended by a particular
topological action. This action is parametrized by two non-dynamical harmonic
forms and generalizes the $\theta$-term in usual gauge theories. In the second
part the general framework is applied to study the topological Casimir effect
in higher-abelian gauge theories at finite temperature at equilibrium. The
extended higher-abelian Maxwell theory is discussed in detail and an exact
expression for the free energy is derived. A non-trivial topology of the
background space-time modifies the spectrum of both the zero-point fluctuations
and the occupied states forming the thermal ensemble. The vacuum (Casimir)
energy has two contributions: one related to the propagating modes and the
second one related to the topologically inequivalent configurations of
higher-abelian gauge fields. In the high temperature limit the leading term is
of Stefan-Boltzmann type and the topological contributions are suppressed. With
a particular choice of parameters extended higher-abelian Maxwell theories of
different degrees are shown to be dual. On the $n$-dimensional torus we provide
explicit expressions for the thermodynamic functions in the low- and high
temperature regimes, respectively. Finally, the impact of the background
topology on the two-point correlation function of a higher-abelian variant of
the Polyakov loop operator is analyzed.

circular dichroism (CD) in resonant soft x-ray diffraction at the Ti $L_3$ edge
from such superlattices. The authors ascribe the CD to the chiral rotation of a
polar vector. However, a polar vector is invisible to the parity-even
electric-dipole transition which governs absorption in the soft x-ray region. A
realistic, non-magnetic explanation of the observed effect is found in
Templeton-Templeton scattering. Following this route, the origin of the CD in
Bragg diffraction is shown by us to be the chiral array of charge quadrupole
moments that forms in these heterostructures. While there is no charge
quadrupole moment in the spherically symmetric $3d^0$ valence state of
Ti$^{4+}$, the excited state $2p_{3/2}3d(t_{2g})$ at the Ti $L_3$ resonance is
known to have a quadrupole moment. Our expressions for intensities of satellite
Bragg spots in resonance-enhanced diffraction of circularly polarized x-rays,

Shafer {\it{et al.}} We predict both intensities of Bragg spots for the second
harmonic of a chiral superlattice and circular polarization created from
unpolarized x-rays, in order that our successful explanation of existing

quantum physics. The mechanism explored the notion that a given physical
quantity is always defined and measured relative to a reference frame, in
general, not explained in the theoretical description of quantum physical
experiments. Recently, the resource theory of asymmetry deals explicitly with
what are the physical conditions for a quantum system to serve as a good
reference frame. Nonetheless, to quantify a quantum reference frame in relation
to another one it is a important task to establish an internal description of
quantum theory, i.e., without the need of a classical reference frame. In this
work we address this issue by the concept of mutual asymmetry and use this
machinery in the Page-Wootters mechanism by identifying the concept of mutual
asymmetry as mutual or internal coherence. To do so, the notion of quantum
coherence in relation of a quantum reference frame is revisited and a
quantifier is proposed in this scenario. Also, this open space to investigate
the link of internal coherence and correlations, as proposed by Page and

dissipative processes in disk-planet interactions that lead to orbital
migration. In multi-planet systems that host giant planets, the perturbation of
the protoplanetary disk strongly affects the migration of companion planets. By
studying the well-characterized resonant planetary system around GJ 876 we aim
to explore which effects shape disk-driven migration in such a multi-planet
system to form resonant chains. We modelled the orbital migration of three
planets embedded in a protoplanetary disk using two-dimensional locally
isothermal hydrodynamical simulations. We performed a parameter study by
varying the disk thickness, $\alpha$ viscosity, mass as well as the initial
position of the planets. Moreover, we have analysed and compared simulations
with various boundary conditions at the disk's inner rim. We find that due to
the high masses of the giant planets, substantial eccentricity can be excited
in the disk. This results in large variations of the torque acting on the outer
lower-mass planet, which we attribute to a shift of Lindblad and corotation
resonances due to disk eccentricity. Depending on disk parameters, the
migration of the outer planet can be stopped in a non-resonant state. In other
models, the outer planet is able to open a partial gap and to circularize the
disk again, later entering a 2:1 resonance with the most massive planet in the
system to complete the observed Laplace resonance. Disk-mediated interactions
between planets due to spiral waves and excitation of disk eccentricity cause
deviations from smooth inward migration of exterior lower mass planets.
Self-consistent modelling of the disk-driven migration of multi-planet systems
is thus mandatory. Our results are compatible with a late migration of the
outermost planet into the resonant chain, when the giant planet pair already is
in resonance.

relatively little research has gone into the abstraction of the scheduling
process itself, hampering design, tuning, and comparison of existing
techniques. In this work, we propose a reference architecture for datacenter
schedulers. The architecture follows five design principles: components with
clearly distinct responsibilities, grouping of related components where
possible, separation of mechanism from policy, scheduling as complex workflow,
and hierarchical multi-scheduler structure. To demonstrate the validity of the
reference architecture, we map to it state-of-the-art datacenter schedulers. We
find scheduler-stages are commonly underspecified in peer-reviewed
publications. Through trace-based simulation and real-world experiments, we
show underspecification of scheduler-stages can lead to significant variations

integrating over the available phase space for the final states and averaging
over the initial states. The first noticeable observation in the spin-summed of

respectively are missing in the presence of strong magnetic field. We have
found that in the presence of strong magnetic field, the crosssection of $e^-

inversely proportional to the fourth power of the center-of-mass energy

$e$-$\mu$ scattering in ${\rm t}$ channel, {\em i.e.} for $e^- \mu^-

Similarly the crosssections for both Bhabha and M{\o}ller scattering at the
lowest-order diverges in the infrared limit. However, the finite term decreases
with $\sqrt{s}$ much faster than the vacuum alone. In addition there is finite

interface-specific, alloptical technique, vibrational sum frequency generation
(v-SFG) spectroscopy, is often uniquely capable of characterizing the structure
and dynamics of interfacial species. The desired information in such a
measurement is the complex second order susceptibility which gives rise to the
nonlinear response from interfacial molecules. The ability to detect molecular
species yielding only small contributions to the susceptibility is meanwhile
limited by the precision by which the spectral phase and amplitude can be
determined. In this study we describe a new spectrometer design that offers
unprecedented phase and amplitude accuracy while significantly improving the
sensitivity of the technique. Combining a full collinear beam geometry with a
technique enabling the simultaneous measurement of the complex sample and
reference spectrum, uncertainties in the reference phase and amplitude are
shown to be greatly reduced. Furthermore, we show that using balanced
detection, the signal to noise ratio can be increased by one order of
magnitude. The capabilities of the spectrometer are demonstrated by the
isolation of a small isotropic surface signal from the bulk dominated nonlinear
optical response of z-cut quartz. The achieved precision of our spectrometer
enables measurements not currently feasible in v-SFG spectroscopy.

Passive approaches such as the use of stretchable conductors and novel
geometries improve their response to mechanical stress but cannot salvage the
interconnect if a fault were to occur. Active approaches using self healing
techniques can repair a fault and have been demonstrated using methods that
either use relatively rare materials, change conventional interconnect
fabrication processes, only address faults due to mechanical stress or do not
permit stretching. In this work we discuss a self healing technique that
overcomes these limitations and demonstrate heals having metallic conductivity
and nearly plastic stretchability. This is achieved using a dispersion of
conductive particles in an insulating fluid encapsulated over the interconnect.
Healing is automatically triggered by the electric field appearing in the open
gap of a failed interconnect, irrespective of the cause of failure. The field
polarizes the conductive particles causing them aggregate and chain up to
bridge the gap and repair the fault. Using copper-silicone oil dispersions, we
show self healing interconnects with the stretchable heal having conductivity
of about $5 \times 10^{5}$ Sm and allowing strains from 12 to 60. Previously,
stretchable interconnects used materials other than copper. Here we effectively
show self healing, stretchable copper. This work promises high speed, self

context-free extension of standard Metric Temporal Logic (MTL). It is well
known that satisfiability of future MTL is undecidable when interpreted over
infinite timed words but decidable over finite timed words. On the other hand,
we show that by augmenting future MTL with future context-free temporal

consists of deploying a number of biological nanomachines close to a biological
target (e.g. a tumor), able to deliver drug molecules in the diseased area.
Suitably located transmitters are designed to release a continuous flow of drug
molecules in the surrounding environment, where they diffuse and reach the
target. These molecules are received when they chemically react with compliant
receptors deployed on the receiver surface. In these conditions, if the release
rate is relatively high and the drug absorption time is significant, congestion
may happen, essentially at the receiver site. This phenomenon limits the drug
absorption rate and makes the signal transmission ineffective, with an
undesired diffusion of drug molecules elsewhere in the body. The original
contribution of this paper consists of a theoretical analysis of the causes of
congestion in diffusion-based molecular communications. For this purpose, it is
proposed a reception model consisting of a set of pure loss queuing systems.
The proposed model exhibits an excellent agreement with the results of a
simulation campaign made by using the Biological and Nano-Scale communication
simulator version 2 (BiNS2), a well-known simulator for molecular
communications, whose reliability has been assessed through in-vitro
experiments. The obtained results can be used in rate control algorithms to
optimally determine the optimal release rate of molecules in drug delivery
applications.

the system's control capabilities, it may be possible to use the remaining
authority in such a way that the system's control objectives remain achievable.
In this paper, we consider the problem of optimal design for an autonomous

depend on adversarial input produced as a result of loss of authority. The
central question is how to partition the set of control inputs that the system

  Sets",,,,,"math.PR stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper analyses a class of route choice models with closed-form
probability expressions, namely, Generalized Multivariate Extreme Value (GMEV)
models. A large group of these models emerge from different utility formulas
that combine systematic utility and random error terms. Twelve models are
captured in a single discrete choice framework. The additive utility formula
leads to the known logit family, being multinomial, path-size, paired
combinatorial and link-nested. For the multiplicative formulation only the
multinomial and path-size weibit models have been identified; this study also
identifies the paired combinatorial and link-nested variations, and generalizes
the path-size variant. Furthermore, a new traveller's decision rule based on
the multiplicative utility formula with a reference route is presented. Here
the traveller chooses exclusively based on the differences between routes. This
leads to four new GMEV models. We assess the models qualitatively based on a
generic structure of route utility with random foreseen travel times, for which
we empirically identify that the variance of utility should be different from
thus far assumed for multinomial probit and logit-kernel models. The expected
travellers' behaviour and model-behaviour under simple network changes are
analysed. Furthermore, all models are estimated and validated on an
illustrative network example with long distance and short distance
origin-destination pairs. The new multiplicative models based on differences
outperform the additive models in both tests.

techniques - specifically, Classification and Regression Trees (CART) - in
observational studies where the receipt of the treatment is not randomized, but
the assignment to the treatment can be assumed to be randomized (irregular
assignment mechanism). The paper contributes to the growing applied machine
learning literature on causal inference, by proposing a modified version of the
Causal Tree (CT) algorithm to draw causal inference from an irregular
assignment mechanism. The proposed method is developed by merging the CT
approach with the instrumental variable framework to causal inference, hence
the name Causal Tree with Instrumental Variable (CT-IV). As compared to CT, the
main strength of CT-IV is that it can deal more efficiently with the
heterogeneity of causal effects, as demonstrated by a series of numerical
results obtained on synthetic data. Then, the proposed algorithm is used to
evaluate a public policy implemented by the Tuscan Regional Administration
(Italy), which aimed at easing the access to credit for small firms. In this
context, CT-IV breaks fresh ground for target-based policies, identifying
interesting heterogeneous causal effects.

interpretations of several Ramanujan's famous congruence formulas. In 2005 and

magnetic-field lines, leading to phase ""mixing"" of their distribution function
and consequently to smoothing out of any ""compressive"" fluctuations (of
density, pressure, etc.,). This rapid mixing underlies Landau damping of these
fluctuations in a quiescent plasma-one of the most fundamental physical
phenomena that make plasma different from a conventional fluid. Nevertheless,
broad power-law spectra of compressive fluctuations are observed in turbulent
astrophysical plasmas (most vividly, in the solar wind) under conditions
conducive to strong Landau damping. Elsewhere in nature, such spectra are
normally associated with fluid turbulence, where energy cannot be dissipated in
the inertial scale range and is therefore cascaded from large scales to small.
By direct numerical simulations and theoretical arguments, it is shown here
that turbulence of compressive fluctuations in collisionless plasmas strongly
resembles one in a collisional fluid and does have broad power-law spectra.
This ""fluidization"" of collisionless plasmas occurs because phase mixing is
strongly suppressed on average by ""stochastic echoes"", arising due to nonlinear
advection of the particle distribution by turbulent motions. Besides resolving
the long-standing puzzle of observed compressive fluctuations in the solar
wind, our results suggest a conceptual shift for understanding kinetic plasma
turbulence generally: rather than being a system where Landau damping plays the
role of dissipation, a collisionless plasma is effectively dissipationless
except at very small scales. The universality of ""fluid"" turbulence physics is
thus reaffirmed even for a kinetic, collisionless system.

true random behavior. We then aggregate the resulting data from multiple cells
to obtain a TRNG capable of providing a high throughput of random numbers at
low latency.
  To demonstrate that our TRNG design is viable using commodity DRAM chips, we
rigorously characterize the behavior of activation failures in 282
state-of-the-art LPDDR4 devices from three major DRAM manufacturers. We verify
our observations using four additional DDR3 DRAM devices from the same

data that remains robust over both time and temperature variation. We use our
observations to develop D-RanGe, a methodology for extracting true random
numbers from commodity DRAM devices with high throughput and low latency by
deliberately violating the read access timing parameters. We evaluate the
quality of our TRNG using the commonly-used NIST statistical test suite for

  Let $d \ge 2$ and $E\subset {\Bbb R}^d$ be a compact set. For $k\ge 1$,
define $$\Delta_k(E)=\left\{\left(|x^1-x^2|, \dots, |x^i-x^j|,\dots,
|x^k-x^{k+1}|\right): \left\{x^i\right\}_{i=1}^{k+1}\subset E\right\} \subset

$k\le d$, this is (up to permutations) the set of congruences of $(k+1)$-point
configurations in $E$; for $k>d$, it is the edge-length set of $(k+1)$-graphs
whose vertices are in $E$. Previous works by a number of authors have found
values $s_{k,d}<d$ so that if the Hausdorff dimension of $E$ is $>s_{k,d}$,
then $\Delta_k(E)$ has positive Lebesgue measure. In this paper we study more
refined properties of $\Delta_k(E)$, namely the existence of (exactly) similar
or multi--similar configurations. For $r\in\Bbb R,\, r>0$, let
$$\Delta_{k}^{r}(E):=\left\{\vec{t}\in \Delta_k\left(E\right): r\vec{t}\in
\Delta_k\left(E\right)\right\}\subset \Delta_k\left(E\right).$$ We show that
for all $E$ with Hausdorff dimension $>s_{k,d}$, a natural measure $\nu_k$ on
$\Delta_k(E)$ and all $r\in\Bbb R_+$, one has
$\nu_k\left(\Delta_{k}^{r}\left(E\right)\right)>0$. Thus, there exist many
pairs, $\{x^1, x^2, \dots, x^{k+1}\}$ and $\{y^1, y^2, \dots, y^{k+1}\}$, in
$E$ which are similar by the scaling factor $r$.
  We also show the existence of triply-similar and multi-similar
configurations.

frequency and amplitude are consistent with those of mHz QPOs reported in other

the source being in a soft spectral state during these observations, findings

the mHz oscillations are associated with black body emission from the neutron

arc-second scale resolutions often insufficient to reliably separate radio
emission in distant galaxies originating from star-formation and AGN-related
activity. Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) can offer a solution by
identifying only the most compact radio emitting regions in galaxies at
cosmological distances where the high brightness temperatures (in excess of
$10^5$ K) can only be reliably attributed to AGN activity. We present the first
in a series of papers exploring the faint compact radio population using a new
wide-field VLBI survey of the GOODS-N field. The unparalleled sensitivity of
the European VLBI Network (EVN) will probe a luminosity range rarely seen in
deep wide-field VLBI observations, thus providing insights into the role of AGN
to radio luminosities of the order $10^{22}~\mathrm{W\,Hz^{-1}}$ across cosmic
time. The newest VLBI techniques are used to completely cover an entire 7'.5
radius area to milliarcsecond resolutions, while bright radio sources ($S >
0.1$ mJy) are targeted up to 25 arcmin from the pointing centre. Multi-source
self-calibration, and a primary beam model for the EVN array are used to
correct for residual phase errors and primary beam attenuation respectively.

\mathcal{T}$ the subcategory of objects finitely presented by $R$. We
investigate the relative rigid objects, \ie $R[1]$-rigid objects of
$\mathcal{T}$. Our main results show that the $R[1]$-rigid objects in
$\operatorname{\mathsf{pr}}(R)$ are in bijection with $\tau$-rigid
$\Gamma$-modules, and the maximal $R[1]$-rigid objects with respect to
$\operatorname{\mathsf{pr}}(R)$ are in bijection with support $\tau$-tilting
$\Gamma$-modules. We also show that various previously known bijections
involving support $\tau$-tilting modules are recovered under respective
assumptions.

nonreversible piecewise deterministic Markov process. In this scheme, a
particle explores the state space of interest by evolving according to a linear
dynamics which is altered by bouncing on the hyperplane tangent to the gradient
of the negative log-target density at the arrival times of an inhomogeneous
Poisson Process (PP) and by randomly perturbing its velocity at the arrival
times of an homogeneous PP. Under regularity conditions, we show here that the
process corresponding to the first component of the particle and its
corresponding velocity converges weakly towards a Randomized Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo (RHMC) process as the dimension of the ambient space goes to infinity.
RHMC is another piecewise deterministic non-reversible Markov process where a
Hamiltonian dynamics is altered at the arrival times of a homogeneous PP by
randomly perturbing the momentum component. We then establish dimension-free
convergence rates for RHMC for strongly log-concave targets with bounded
Hessians using coupling ideas and hypocoercivity techniques.

of 2012. Excellent temporal coverage was obtained with more than 25
instruments, including the MAGIC, FACT and VERITAS Cherenkov telescopes, the
instruments on board the Swift and Fermi spacecraft, and the telescopes
operated by the GASP-WEBT collaboration.
  Mrk 501 showed a very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray flux above 0.2 TeV of
$\sim$0.5 times the Crab Nebula flux (CU) for most of the campaign. The highest
activity occurred on 2012 June 9, when the VHE flux was $\sim$3 CU, and the
peak of the high-energy spectral component was found to be at $\sim$2 TeV. This
study reports very hard X-ray spectra, and the hardest VHE spectra measured to
date for Mrk 501. The fractional variability was found to increase with energy,
with the highest variability occurring at VHE, and a significant correlation
between the X-ray and VHE bands.
  The unprecedentedly hard X-ray and VHE spectra measured imply that their low-
and high-energy components peaked above 5 keV and 0.5 TeV, respectively, during
a large fraction of the observing campaign, and hence that Mrk 501 behaved like
an extreme high-frequency- peaked blazar (EHBL) throughout the 2012 observing
season. This suggests that being an EHBL may not be a permanent characteristic
of a blazar, but rather a state which may change over time. The one-zone
synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) scenario can successfully describe the segments
of the SED where most energy is emitted, with a significant correlation between
the electron energy density and the VHE gamma-ray activity, suggesting that
most of the variability may be explained by the injection of high-energy
electrons. The one-zone SSC scenario used reproduces the behaviour seen between
the measured X-ray and VHE gamma-ray fluxes, and predicts that the correlation
becomes stronger with increasing energy of the X-rays.

filters which are composed by the outer product of 1-D filters. After being
trained, the 3-D rank-1 filters can be decomposed into 1-D filters in the test
time for fast inference. The reason that we train 3-D rank-1 filters in the
training stage instead of consecutive 1-D filters is that a better gradient
flow can be obtained with this setting, which makes the training possible even
in the case where the network with consecutive 1-D filters cannot be trained.
The 3-D rank-1 filters are updated by both the gradient flow and the outer
product of the 1-D filters in every epoch, where the gradient flow tries to
obtain a solution which minimizes the loss function, while the outer product
operation tries to make the parameters of the filter to live on a rank-1
sub-space. Furthermore, we show that the convolution with the rank-1 filters
results in low rank outputs, constraining the final output of the CNN also to
live on a low dimensional subspace.

autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles. Collision warning systems (CCWs), as a
proposed solution framework, can be relied as the main structure to address the
issues in this area. In this framework, information plays a very important
role. Each vehicle has access to its own information immediately. However,
another vehicle information is available through a wireless communication. Data
loss is very common issue for such communication approach. As a consequence,
CCW would suffer from providing late or false detection awareness. Robust
estimation of lost data is of this paper interest which its goal is to
reconstruct or estimate lost network data from previous available or estimated
data as close to actual values as possible under different rate of lost. In
this paper, we will investigate and evaluate three different algorithms
including constant velocity, constant acceleration and Kalman estimator for
this purpose. We make a comparison between their performance which reveals the
ability of them in term of accuracy and robustness for estimation and

physics. The spontaneous, symmetry-breaking charge order, responsible for the
stripe or the nematic phase, has been of great interest in many contexts where
strong correlations are present, such as high-temperature superconductivity and
quantum Hall effect. In this article we show the unexpected result that in an
interacting two-dimensional electron system, the robustness of the nematic
phase, which represents an order in the charge degree of freedom, not only
depends on the orbital index of the topmost, half-filled Landau level, but it
is also strongly correlated with the magnetic order of the system.
Intriguingly, when the system is fully magnetized, the nematic phase is
particularly robust and persists to much higher temperatures compared to the
nematic phases observed previously in quantum Hall systems. Our results give
fundamental new insight into the role of magnetization in stabilizing the
nematic phase, while also providing a new knob with which it can be effectively
tuned.

triggered a widespread support for weather derivatives as a means of mitigating
the risk associated with climate change on agriculture. However, these products
are faced with basis risk as a result of poor design and modelling of the
underlying weather variable (temperature). In order to circumvent these
problems, a novel time-varying mean-reversion L\'evy regime-switching model is
used to model the dynamics of the deseasonalized temperature dynamics. Using
plots and test statistics, it is observed that the residuals of the
deseasonalized temperature data are not normally distributed. To model the
non-normality in the residuals, we propose using the hyperbolic distribution to
capture the semi-heavy tails and skewness in the empirical distributions of the
residuals for the shifted regime. The proposed regime-switching model has a
mean-reverting heteroskedastic process in the base regime and a L\'evy process
in the shifted regime. By using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, the
parameters of the proposed model are estimated. The proposed model is flexible

their demand in integral multiples of a common packet size. It is known that
one can compute pure Nash equilibria for integrally-splittable congestion games
within a running time that is pseudo-polynomial in the aggregated demand of the

$\epsilon>0$, a packet size $k_{\epsilon}$ and prove that the associated
$k_{\epsilon}$-splittable Nash equilibrium is an $\epsilon$-approximate Nash
equilibrium for the original game.
  We further show that our result applies to multimarket oligopolies with

understand how selection of mentor changes from one phase to another, and
identify type of mentoring support that entrepreneurs need during each phase.
Qualitative data were collected from entrepreneurs through semi-structured

different mentoring support and skills when they go through each phase of their
entrepreneurial career. The conception phase is the most important phase
because entrepreneurs are still in the process of developing their product and
want a mentor to help them to evaluate the viability of their product.
Entrepreneurs at this phase are also more concerned about the surface level
characteristics of mentor such as age, gender, race and language than the other
phases. At the start-up phase, entrepreneurs want a mentor who can provide them
networking support and help them in decision making. Besides that, the IT
entrepreneurs think that mentoring services provided in the incubators are very
generic and not helpful. On the contrary, entrepreneurs at the growth phase
want a mentor whom they see as a role model and is more experienced and
successful. Entrepreneurs at this phase do not care much about factors such as
gender, race and religion of the mentor.

protection. To realize nodal helical phases one would need to consider
isotropic infinite-range inter-particle interaction. This interaction could
emerge because of a momentum conserving scattering of electron from a bosonic
mode. For repulsive/attractive interactions in density/pseudospin channel
system undergoes a transition to helical insulator phase. For an attractive
density-density interaction, a new metallic phase forms that hosts {\it nodal
circle} and {\it nodal sphere} in two and three dimensions, respectively. A
{\it sheet singularity} of Berry curvature is highlighted as a peculiar feature
of the nodal sphere phase in 3D and represent the extension of the Berry
monopole singularities into inflated monopole. To illustrate the properties of
these helical phases we investigate Landau levels in both metallic and
insulating phases. Our study provides an extension of the paradigm in the
interacting Dirac matter and makes an interesting connection to inflated
topological singularities in cosmology.

literature to describe transmembrane potential in spiny dendrites. The
anomalous behavior has been related in the literature to the geometrical
properties of the system, in particular, the density of spines, by experiments,
computer simulations, and in comb-like models.~The same PDE can be related to
more than one stochastic process leading to anomalous diffusion behavior. The
time-fractional diffusion equation can be associated to a continuous time
random walk (CTRW) with power-law waiting time probability or to a special case
of the Erd\'ely-Kober fractional diffusion, described by the ggBm. In this
work, we show that time fractional generalization of the cable equation arises
naturally in the CTRW by considering a superposition of Markovian processes and
in a {\it ggBm-like} construction of the random variable.

functions. Their structures share some similarities with photosynthetic antenna
complexes, particularly in the ordered arrangement of photoactive molecules
with large transition dipole moments. As the role of photoexcitations in
microtubules remains an open question, here we analyze tryptophan molecules,
the amino acid building block of microtubules with the largest transition
dipole strength. By taking their positions and dipole orientations from
realistic models capable of reproducing tubulin experimental spectra, and using
a Hamiltonian widely employed in quantum optics to describe light-matter
interactions, we show that such molecules arranged in their native microtubule
configuration exhibit a superradiant ground state, which represents an
excitation fully extended on the chromophore lattice. We also show that such a
superradiant ground state emerges due to supertransfer coupling between the
ground states of smaller blocks of the microtubule. In the dynamics we find
that the spreading of excitation is ballistic in the absence of external
sources of disorder and strongly dependent on initial conditions. The velocity
of photoexcitation spreading is shown to be enhanced by the supertransfer
effect with respect to the velocity one would expect from the strength of the
nearest-neighbor coupling between tryptophan molecules in the microtubule.
Finally, such structures are shown to have an enhanced robustness to static
disorder when compared to geometries that include only short-range
interactions. These cooperative effects (superradiance and supertransfer) may
induce ultra-efficient photoexcitation absorption and could enhance excitonic
energy transfer in microtubules over long distances under physiological
conditions.
