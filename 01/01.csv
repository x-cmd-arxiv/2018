density-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates having repulsive interparticle
interactions within each condensate ($g>0$). By using an adiabatic perturbation
theory in the parameter $g_{12}/{g}$, we show that, contrary to the case of two
solitons in scalar condensates, the interactions between solitons are
attractive when the interparticle interactions between condensates are
repulsive $g_{12}>0$. As a result, the relative motion of dark solitons with
equal chemical potential $\mu$ is well approximated by harmonic oscillations of
angular frequency $w_r=(\mu/\hbar)\sqrt{({8}/{15}){g_{12}}/{g}}$. We also show
that in finite systems, the resonance of this anomalous excitation mode with
the spin density mode of lowest energy gives rise to alternating dynamical
instability and stability fringes as a function of the perturbative parameter.
In the presence of harmonic trapping (with angular frequency $\Omega$) the
solitons are driven by the superposition of two harmonic motions at a frequency
given by $w^2=(\Omega/\sqrt{2})^2+w_r^2$. When $g_{12}<0$, these two
oscillators compete to give rise to an overall effective potential that can be
either single well or double well through a pitchfork bifurcation. All our
theoretical results are compared with numerical solutions of the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the dynamics and the Bogoliubov equations for the
linear stability. A good agreement is found between them.

sequences that are generated by an i.i.d. doubly-binary symmetric source. Each
sequence is observed by a different terminal. The two hypotheses correspond to
different levels of correlation between the two source components, i.e., the
crossover probability between the two. The terminals communicate with a
decision function via rate-limited noiseless links. We analyze the tradeoff
between the exponential decay of the two error probabilities associated with
the hypothesis test and the communication rates. We first consider the
side-information setting where one encoder is allowed to send the full
sequence. For this setting, previous work exploits the fact that a decoding
error of the source does not necessarily lead to an erroneous decision upon the
hypothesis. We provide improved achievability results by carrying out a tighter
analysis of the effect of binning error; the results are also more complete as
they cover the full exponent tradeoff and all possible correlations. We then
turn to the setting of symmetric rates for which we utilize Korner-Marton
coding to generalize the results, with little degradation with respect to the
performance with a one-sided constraint (side-information setting).

spreading protocols. In all three, in the beginning one node of a graph is
informed. In the Push setting, every round every informed node chooses a
neighbor uniformly at random and, if it is not already informed anyway, informs
it. In the Pull setting, each round each uninformed node chooses a neighbor
uniformly at random and asks it for the rumor; if the asked neighbor is
informed, now also the asking node is informed. Push&Pull is a combination of
Push and Pull: In each round, each node picks a neighbor uniformly at random.
If at least one of both knows the rumor, after this round, both know the rumor.
Clementi et al. have considered Push in settings where the underlying graph
changes each round. In one setting they investigated, in each round the
underlying graph is a newly sampled Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n,p)$.
They show that if $p\geq 1/n$ then with probability $1-o(1)$ (as $n\rightarrow
\infty$) the number of rounds needed until all nodes are informed is
$\mathcal{O}(\ln(n))$. Doerr and Kostrygin introduced a general framework to
analyze rumor spreading algorithms; using this framework, for $a>0$ and $p=a/n$
they improved the previous results in the described setting: The expected
number of rounds needed by Push was determined to be
$\log_{2-e^{-a}}(n)+1/(1-e^{-a})\ln(n)+\mathcal{O}(1)$; also large deviation
bounds were obtained. Using their framework, we investigate Pull and Push&Pull

inform all nodes is $\log_{2-e^{-a}}(n)+1/a \ln(n)+\mathcal{O}(1)$. Let $\gamma

quasilinear hyperbolic boundary value problem with fully nonlinear Neumann

obtain mass whose order is around the neutral mirror weak boson mass, rendering

quadratic least squares problems. This work is motivated by the need to
initialize the quasi-potential solvers near asymptotically stable equilibria.
An accurate way to do it is to linearize the SDE near the equilibrium and set
the values of the quasi-potential at the neighboring mesh points to the exact

significant correlations for the measured parameters in quasar spectra (Boroson

the EV1, is the ${\mathrm{FeII}}$ strength, defined to be the ratio of the
equivalent width of ${\mathrm{FeII}}$ to the equivalent width of
${\mathrm{H\beta}}$. This allows to construct a quasar main sequence analogous
to the stellar properties driven HR diagram (Sulentic et al. 2001). We try to
find the main driver behind the EV1 among the basic (theoretically motivated)
parameters of an active nucleus (Eddington ratio, black hole mass, accretion
rate, spin, and viewing angle). Based on theoretical modeling using the
photoionization code CLOUDY (Ferland et al. 2013), we test the hypothesis that
the physical driver of EV1 is the maximum of the accretion disk temperature
($\mathrm{T_{BBB}}$), reflected in the shape of the spectral energy

Fe${\mathrm{II}}$ emission come from the Broad Line Region represented as a
constant density cloud in a plane-parallel geometry. We test the effect of
changing Eddington ratio on the $\mathrm{R_{FeII} - T_{BBB}}$ trends with
varying mean hydrogen densities. We also test the effect of adding
microturbulence that affect the line intensities on the overall

accurate modeling of customer waiting behavior, which contains important
information about customer patience (how long a customer is willing to wait)
and service quality (how long a customer needs to wait to get served). Hazard
functions offer dynamic characterization of customer waiting behavior, and
provide critical inputs for agent scheduling. Motivated by this application, we
develop a two-way functional hazards (tF-Hazards) model to study customer
waiting behavior as a function of two timescales, waiting duration and the time
of day that a customer calls in. The model stems from a two-way piecewise
constant hazard function, and imposes low-rank structure and smoothness on the
hazard rates to enhance interpretability. We exploit an alternating direction
method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to optimize a penalized likelihood
function of the model. We carefully analyze the data from a US bank call
center, and provide informative insights about customer patience and service
quality patterns along waiting time and across different times of a day. The
findings provide primitive inputs for call center agent staffing and
scheduling, as well as for call center practitioners to understand the effect

adversarial examples, have emerged as a technically deep challenge and an
important concern for several application domains. Most research on adversarial
examples takes as its only constraint that the perturbed images are similar to
the originals. However, real-world application of these ideas often requires
the examples to satisfy additional objectives, which are typically enforced
through custom modifications of the perturbation process. In this paper, we
propose adversarial generative nets (AGNs), a general methodology to train a
generator neural network to emit adversarial examples satisfying desired
objectives. We demonstrate the ability of AGNs to accommodate a wide range of
objectives, including imprecise ones difficult to model, in two application
domains. In particular, we demonstrate physical adversarial examples---eyeglass
frames designed to fool face recognition---with better robustness,
inconspicuousness, and scalability than previous approaches, as well as a new
attack to fool a handwritten-digit classifier.

provide a foundation for a tensor field theory of Gravitational Strain;
introduced as an advanced formulation of an elastic interpretation of

natural advancement of general relativity to an observable measure of a proper

wave-equation domains is hardly existent. Acoustic enclosures are typical
examples featuring locally reacting surfaces that respond to a pressure
gradient or a pressure difference, alter the enclosure's volume and, hence, the
boundary conditions, and do so locally through their vibrations. Accordingly,
the Laplace-Beltrami operator in the acoustic wave equation lives in a
temporally varying domain depending on the displacement of the locally reacting
surface from equilibrium. The resulting partial differential equations feature
nonlinearities and are coupled though the time-dependent boundary conditions.
The solution to the afore-mentioned problem, as presented here, integrates
techniques from differential geometry, functional analysis, and physics. The
appropriate space is shown to be a (perturbation) fiber bundle. In the context
of a systematic perturbation theory, the solution to the dynamical problem is
obtained from a combination of semigroup techniques for operator evolution
equations and metric perturbation theory as used in AdS/CFT. Duhamel's
principle then yields a time-dependent perturbation theory, called geometric
perturbation theory. It is analogous to, though different from, both Dirac's
time-dependent perturbation theory and the Magnus expansion. Specifically, the
formalism demonstrates that the stationary-domain approximation for vibrational
acoustics only introduces a small error. Analytic simplifications methods are
derived in the framework of the piston approximation. Globally reacting
surfaces (so-called pistons) replace the formerly locally reacting surfaces and
reduce the number of independent variables in the underlying partial
differential equations. In this way, a straightforwardly applicable formalism
is derived for scalar wave equations on time-varying domains.

has a unique solution, one can provably recover the original matrix through two
rounds of semidefinite programming relaxation with minimization of the trace

Lipschitz-stable with respect to perturbations of the observed entries, unlike
more basic algorithms such as nonlinear propagation or ridge regression. Our
proof is based on recursively building a certificate of optimality
corresponding to a dual sum-of-squares (SOS) polynomial. This SOS polynomial is
built from the polynomial ideal generated by the completion constraints and the
monomials provided by the minimization of the trace. The proposed relaxation
fits in the framework of the Lasserre hierarchy, albeit with the key addition

argued resource discovery could be an exogenous variable. We use longitudinal

exhibit control over the properties of the quantised CB and VB states
independently of each other by choosing the dopant density and depth
accordingly, thus offering new possibilities for engineering quantum matter.

the need for accurate, effective, meaningful, and transparent job
recommendations is apparent more than ever. While recommendation systems are
successfully advancing in variety of online domains by creating social and
commercial value, the job recommendation domain is less explored. Existing
systems are mostly focused on content analysis of resumes and job descriptions,
relying heavily on the accuracy and coverage of the semantic analysis and
modeling of the content in which case, they end up usually suffering from
rigidity and the lack of implicit semantic relations that are uncovered from
users' behavior and could be captured by Collaborative Filtering (CF) methods.
Few works which utilize CF do not address the scalability challenges of
real-world systems and the problem of cold-start. In this paper, we propose a
scalable item-based recommendation system for online job recommendations. Our
approach overcomes the major challenges of sparsity and scalability by
leveraging a directed graph of jobs connected by multi-edges representing
various behavioral and contextual similarity signals. The short lived nature of
the items (jobs) in the system and the rapid rate in which new users and jobs
enter the system make the cold-start a serious problem hindering CF methods. We
address this problem by harnessing the power of deep learning in addition to
user behavior to serve hybrid recommendations. Our technique has been leveraged
by CareerBuilder.com which is one of the largest job boards in the world to
generate high-quality recommendations for millions of users.

statistical analysis, especially in the high-dimensional settings. The

method relies on the order of variables, which is often not available or cannot

obtaining a set of covariance matrix estimates under different orders of

Frobenius norm. The proposed method not only ensures the estimator to be
positive definite, but also can capture the underlying sparse structure of the

additional missing entries, this is counterbalanced by the fact that the

which a centralized processor (CP) communicates with mobile users through base
stations (BSs) that are connected to the CP via finite-capacity fronthaul
links. Information theoretically, the downlink of a C-RAN is modeled as a
two-hop broadcast-relay network. Among the various transmission and relaying
strategies for such model, this paper focuses on the compression strategy, in
which the CP centrally encodes the signals to be broadcasted jointly by the
BSs, then compresses and sends these signals to the BSs through the fronthaul
links. This paper characterizes an achievable rate region for a generalized
compression strategy with Marton's multicoding for broadcasting and
multivariate compression for fronthaul transmission. We then compare this rate
region with the distributed decode-forward (DDF) scheme, which achieves the
capacity of the general relay networks to within a constant gap, and show that
the difference lies in that DDF performs Marton's multicoding and multivariate
compression jointly as opposed to successively as in the compression strategy.
A main result of this paper is that under the assumption that the fronthaul
links are subject to a \emph{sum} capacity constraint this difference is
immaterial, so the successive encoding based compression strategy can already
achieve the capacity region of the C-RAN to within a constant gap, where the
gap is independent of the channel parameters and the power constraints at the
BSs. For the special case of the Gaussian network, we further establish that
under individual fronthaul constraints, the compression strategy achieves to
within a constant gap to the \emph{sum} capacity of the C-RAN.

hypothesis that the flux density of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) at a fixed
observing frequency is invariable when the distance of the GRBs increases,
which means the detection rate will be approximately independent of redshift.
We study this behavior theoretically and find that it can be well explained by
the standard forward shock model involving a thin shell expanding in either a
homogeneous interstellar medium (ISM) or a wind environment. We also found that
short GRBs and supernova-associated GRBs, which are at relatively smaller
distances, marginally match the flux-redshift relationship and they could be
outliers. We rule out the assumption that the medium density evolves with
redshift as $n\propto(1+z)^4$ from the current measurements of $n$ and $z$ for
short and long GRBs. In addition, the possible dependence of host flux on the
redshift is also investigated. We find that a similar redshift independence of
the flux exists for host galaxies as well, which implies that the detection
rate of radio hosts might also be independent of the redshift. It is also
hinted that most radio hosts have the spectral indices ranging from
$\beta_h\simeq-1$ to 2.5 in statistics. Finally, we predict the detection rates
of radio afterglows by the next-generation radio telescopes such as the
Five-hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) and the Square Kilometer

Even though usefulness of such states has been shown in several information
processing tasks, there exists no simple method to characterize them for an
arbitrary composite quantum system. Here we present a $(d-3)/2$-parameter
family of BE states each with positive partial transpose (PPT). This family of
PPT-BE states is introduced by constructing an unextendible product basis (UPB)
in $\mathbb{C}^d\otimes\mathbb{C}^d$ with $d$ odd and $d\ge 5$. The range of
each such PPT-BE state is contained in a $2(d-1)$ dimensional entangled
subspace whereas the associated UPB-subspace is of dimension $(d-1)^2+1$. We
further show that each of these PPT-BE states can be written as a convex
combination of $(d-1)/2$ number of rank-4 PPT-BE states. Moreover, we prove
that these rank-4 PPT-BE states are extreme points of the convex compact set
$\mathcal{P}$ of all PPT states in $\mathbb{C}^d\otimes\mathbb{C}^d$, namely
the {\it Peres} set. An interesting geometric implication of our result is that
the convex hull of these rank-4 PPT-BE extreme points -- the $(d-3)/2$-simplex
-- is sitting on the boundary between the set $\mathcal{P}$ and the set of
non-PPT states. We also discuss consequences of our construction in the context
of quantum state discrimination by LOCC.

parameter. The proposed enhanced $q$-LMS ($Eq$-LMS) algorithm utilizes a novel,
parameterless concept of error-correlation energy and normalization of signal
to ensure high convergence, stability and low steady-state error. The proposed
algorithm automatically adapts the learning rate with respect to the error. For
the evaluation purpose the system identification problem is considered.
Extensive experiments show better performance of the proposed $Eq$-LMS
algorithm compared to the standard $q$-LMS approach.

Two-frequency operation is effective when the two species' mass ratios and
charge ratios are sufficiently large, and further when the frequencies required
to optimally trap each species are widely separated. This system resembles two
coincident Paul traps, each operating close to a frequency optimized for one of
the species, such that both species are tightly confined. This method of
operation provides an advantage over single-frequency Paul traps, in which the

employed for three active regions (ARs), namely NOAA AR11261, AR11283 and

the evolution of the components of the WG_M and the magnetic helicity before
the flare and CME occurrences. We found an unique and mutually shared behavior,
called the U-shaped pattern, of the weighted distance component of WG_M and of
the shearing component of the helicity flux before the flare and CME eruptions.
This common pattern is associated with the decreasing-receding phase yet
reported only known to be a necessary feature prior to solar flare eruption(s),
but found now at the same time in the evolution of the shearing helicity
parameter. This result leads to the conclusion that (i) the shearing motion of
photospheric magnetic field may be a key driver for the solar eruption in
addition to the flux emerging process, and that (ii) the found
decreasing-approaching pattern in the evolution of shearing helicity may be
another precursor indicator for improving the forecasting of solar eruptions.

fixed locations on the ground. We aim to characterize the capacity region of
this new type of BC over a given UAV flight duration, by jointly optimizing the

UAV's maximum speed and maximum transmit power constraints. First, to draw
essential insights, we consider two special cases with asymptotically large/low
UAV flight duration/speed, respectively. For the former case, it is shown that
a simple hover-fly-hover (HFH) UAV trajectory with time division multiple
access (TDMA) based orthogonal multiuser transmission is capacity-achieving,
while in the latter case, the UAV should hover at a fixed location that is
nearer to the user with larger achievable rate and in general superposition
coding (SC) based non-orthogonal transmission with interference cancellation at
the receiver of the nearer user is required. Next, we consider the general case
with finite UAV speed and flight duration. We show that the optimal UAV
trajectory should follow a general HFH structure, i.e., the UAV successively
hovers at a pair of initial and final locations above the line segment of the
two users each with a certain amount of time and flies unidirectionally between
them at the maximum speed, and SC is generally needed.

requirements fundamentally limit the UAV's mobility, it remains unknown whether
the UAV is able to provide any performance gain in delay-constrained
communication scenarios. Motivated by this, we study in this paper a
UAV-enabled orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) network where
a UAV is dispatched as a mobile base station (BS) to serve a group of users on
the ground. We consider a minimum-rate ratio (MRR) for each user, defined as
the minimum instantaneous rate required over the average achievable throughput,
to flexibly adjust the percentage of its delay-constrained data traffic. Under
a given set of constraints on the users' MRRs, we aim to maximize the minimum
average throughput of all users by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory and
OFDMA resource allocation. First, we show that the max-min throughput in
general decreases as the users' MRR constraints become more stringent, which
reveals a fundamental throughput-delay tradeoff in UAV-enabled communications.
Next, we propose an iterative parameter-assisted block coordinate descent
method to optimize the UAV trajectory and OFDMA resource allocation
alternately, by applying the successive convex optimization and the Lagrange
duality, respectively. Furthermore, an efficient and systematic UAV trajectory
initialization scheme is proposed based on a simple circular trajectory.

In traditional Hopfield NADC based designs, increasing the number of bits could

unaffected. Therefore, the Mott-superfluid transition with even filling
strongly depends on the strength of the QZE, and we show that the QZE can act
as a control parameter for this transition at fixed hopping. Using quantum
Monte Carlo simulations, we elucidate the nature of the phase transitions and
examine in detail the nematic order: the first-order Mott-superfluid transition
with even filling observed in the absence of QZE becomes second order for weak
QZE, in contradistinction to our mean-field results which predict a first-order
transition in a larger range of QZE. Furthermore, a spin nematic order with
director along the $z$ axis is found in the odd Mott lobes and in the
superfluid phase for energetically favored $\sigma=\pm1$ states. In the
superfluid phase with even filling, the $xy$ components of the nematic director
remain finite only for moderate QZE.

increasingly seen as the important building blocks for modern higher order
Godunov-type schemes. In the past, building a generalized Riemann problem
solver was seen as an intricately mathematical task for complicated physical or
engineering problems because the associated Riemann problem is different for
each hyperbolic system of interest. This paper changes that situation.
  The HLLI Riemann solver is a recently-proposed Riemann solver that is
universal in that it is applicable to any hyperbolic system, whether in
conservation form or with non-conservative products. The HLLI Riemann solver is
also complete in the sense that if it is given a complete set of eigenvectors,
it represents all waves with minimal dissipation. It is, therefore, very
attractive to build a generalized Riemann problem solver version of the HLLI
Riemann solver. This is the task that is accomplished in the present paper. We
show that at second order, the generalized Riemann problem version of the HLLI
Riemann solver is easy to design. Our GRP solver is also complete and universal
because it inherits those good properties from original HLLI Riemann solver. We
also show how our GRP solver can be adapted to the solution of hyperbolic
systems with stiff source terms.
  Our generalized HLLI Riemann solver is easy to implement and performs
robustly and well over a range of test problems. All implementation-related
details are presented. Results from several stringent test problems are shown.
These test problems are drawn from many different hyperbolic systems, and
include hyperbolic systems in conservation form; with non-conservative
products; and with stiff source terms. The present generalized Riemann problem
solver performs well on all of them.

$D$ is biholomorphic to a bounded symmetric domain. This theorem can be viewed

Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. The need for foreground removal has led
to the development of two main techniques, often referred to as ""foreground
avoidance"" and ""foreground subtraction."" Avoidance is associated with filtering
foregrounds in Fourier space, while subtraction uses an explicit foreground
model that is removed. Using 1088 hours of data from the 64-element PAPER
array, we demonstrate that subtraction of a foreground model prior to
delay-space foreground filtering results in a modest but measurable improvement
of the performance of the filter. This proof-of-concept result shows that
improvement stems from the reduced dynamic range requirements needed for the
foreground filter: subtraction of a foreground model reduces the total
foreground power, so for a fixed dynamic range, the filter can push towards
fainter limits. We also find that the choice of window function used in the
foreground filter can have an appreciable affect on the performance near the
edges of the observing band. We demonstrate these effects using a smaller 3
hour sampling of data from the MWA, and find that the hybrid filtering and
subtraction removal approach provides similar improvements across the band as
seen in the case with PAPER-64.

the supply and demand for taxi services, the underlying road network, and the
public acceptance of taxi ridesharing (TRS) affect the optimal number of taxis
for a particular city, as well as commuters' average waiting time and trip
time. Results reveal certain universal features of the taxi dynamics with
real-time taxi-booking---that there is a well-defined transition between the
oversaturated phase when demand exceeds supply, and the undersaturated phase
when supply exceeds demand. The boundary between the two phases gives the
optimal number of taxis a city should accommodate, given the specific demand,
road network and commuter habits. Adding or removing taxis may affect commuter
experience very differently in the two phases revealed. In the oversaturated
phase the average waiting time is affected exponentially, while in the
undersaturated phase it is affected sub-linearly. We analyze various factors
that can shift the phase boundary, and show that an increased level of
acceptance for TRS universally shifts the phase boundary by reducing the number
of taxis needed. We discuss some of the useful insights on the benefits and
costs of TRS, especially how under certain situations TRS will not only have
economic benefits for commuters, but can also save the overall travel time for
the shared parties, by significantly reducing the time commuters spend on
waiting for taxis. Our simulations also suggest that simple artificial taxi
systems can capture most of the universal features of the taxi dynamics. The

$^{166}$Er$^{3+}$:$^7$LiYF$_4$ crystal. The OVNA method is based on generation
and detection of modulated optical sideband by using a radio-frequency vector
network analyzer. This technique is widely used in the field of microwave
photonics for the characterization of optical responses of optical devices such
as filters and high-Q resonators. However, dense solid-state atomic ensembles
induce a large phase shift on one of the optical sidebands which results in the
appearance of extra features on the measured transmission response. We present
a simple theoretical model which accurately describes the observed spectra and
helps to reconstruct the absorption profile of a solid-state atomic ensemble as
well as corresponding change of the refractive index in the vicinity of atomic
resonances.

  Raman Scattering","10 pages, 7 figures",,"10.1109/JLT.2018.2830973",,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A Gaussian noise (GN) model is presented that properly accounts for an
arbitrary frequency dependent signal power profile along the link. This enables
the evaluation of the impact of inter-channel stimulated Raman scattering
(ISRS) on the optical Kerr nonlinearity. Additionally, the frequency dependent
fiber attenuation can be taken into account and transmission systems that use
hybrid amplification schemes can be modeled, where distributed Raman
amplification is partly applied over the optical spectrum. To include the
latter two cases, a set of coupled ordinary differential equations must be
numerically solved in order to obtain the signal power profile yielding a
semi-analytical model. However for lumped amplification and negligible
variation in fiber attenuation, a less complex and fully analytical model is
presented which is referred to as the ISRS GN model. The derived model is exact
to first-order for Gaussian modulated signals and extensively validated by
numerical split-step simulations. A maximum deviation of $0.1$~dB in nonlinear
interference power between simulations and the ISRS GN model is found. The
model is applied to a transmission system that occupies an optical bandwidth of
$10$~THz, representing the entire C+L band. At optimum launch power, changes of
up to $2$~dB in nonlinear interference power due to ISRS are reported.
Furthermore, comparable models published in the literature are benchmarked
against the ISRS GN model.

approximation. It is based on a square error minimization 'on a vertical' axis.
The LSE method is simple and easy also for analytical purposes. However, if
data span is large over several magnitudes or non-linear LSE is used, severe
numerical instability can be expected. The presented contribution describes a
simple method for large span of data LSE computation. It is especially
convenient if large span of data are to be processed, when the 'standard'
pseudoinverse matrix is ill conditioned. It is actually based on a LSE solution
using orthogonal basis vectors instead of orthonormal basis vectors. The
presented approach has been used for a linear regression as well as for
approximation using radial basis functions.
