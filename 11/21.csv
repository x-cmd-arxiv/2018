written tests by developers and automatically generated ones. In this paper, we
explore a third solution: to automatically improve existing test cases written
by developers. We present the concept, design, and implementation of a system
called \dspot, that takes developer-written test cases as input (junit tests in
Java) and synthesizes improved versions of them as output. Those test
improvements are given back to developers as patches or pull requests, that can
be directly integrated in the main branch of the test code base. We have
evaluated DSpot in a deep, systematic manner over 40 real-world unit test
classes from 10 notable and open-source software projects. We have amplified
all test methods from those 40 unit test classes. In 26/40 cases, DSpot is able
to automatically improve the test under study, by triggering new behaviors and
adding new valuable assertions. Next, for ten projects under consideration, we
have proposed a test improvement automatically synthesized by \dspot to the
lead developers. In total, 13/19 proposed test improvements were accepted by
the developers and merged into the main code base. This shows that DSpot is
capable of automatically improving unit-tests in real-world, large-scale Java
software.

in probabilistic reasoning, originating with the seminal work of Pearl and
others from the early 1990s. This paper develops a new, categorically oriented
view based on a clear distinction between syntax (string diagrams) and
semantics (stochastic matrices), connected via interpretations as
structure-preserving functors. A key notion in the identification of causal
effects is that of an intervention, whereby a variable is forcefully set to a
particular value independent of any prior propensities. We represent the effect
of such an intervention as an endofunctor which performs `string diagram
surgery' within the syntactic category of string diagrams. This diagram surgery
in turn yields a new, interventional distribution via the interpretation
functor. While in general there is no way to compute interventional
distributions purely from observed data, we show that this is possible in
certain special cases using a calculational tool called comb disintegration. We
demonstrate the use of this technique on a well-known toy example, where we
predict the causal effect of smoking on cancer in the presence of a confounding
common cause. After developing this specific example, we show this technique
provides simple sufficient conditions for computing interventions which apply
to a wide variety of situations considered in the causal inference literature.

study a new operator $\mathbf{L^\varepsilon}$ obtained by linearizing the
Boltzmann operator for mixtures around local Maxwellian distributions, where
all the species evolve with different small macroscopic velocities of order
$\varepsilon$, $\varepsilon >0$. This is a non-equilibrium state for the
mixture. We establish a quasi-stability property for the Dirichlet form of
$\mathbf{L^\varepsilon}$ in the global equilibrium weighted $L^2$ space. More
precisely, we consider the explicit upper bound that has been proved for the
entropy production functional associated to $\mathbf{L}$ and we show that the
same estimate holds for the entropy production functional associated to
$\mathbf{L^\varepsilon}$, up to a correction of order $\varepsilon$.

  of its importance","42 pages, 3 figures",,,,"physics.hist-ph physics.class-ph physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Starting from the observation that the simplest form of forced mechanical
oscillation serves as a standard model for analyzing a broad variety of
resonance processes in many fields of physics and engineering, the remarkably
slow development leading to this insight is reviewed. Forced oscillations and
mechanical resonance were already described by Galileo early in the 17th
century, even though he misunderstood them. The phenomenon was then completely
ignored by Newton but was partly rediscovered in the 18th century, as a purely
mathematical surprise, by Euler. Not earlier than in the 19th century did
Thomas Young give the first correct description. Until then, forced
oscillations were not investigated for the purpose of understanding the motion
of a pendulum, or of a mass on a spring, or the acoustic resonance, but in the
context of the ocean tides. Thus, in the field of pure mechanics the results by
Young had no echo at all. On the other hand, in the 19th century mechanical
resonance disasters were observed ever more frequently, e.g. with suspension
bridges and steam engines, but were not recognized as such. The equations
governing forced mechanical oscillations were then rediscovered in other fields
like acoustics and electrodynamics and were later found to play an important
role also in quantum mechanics. Only then, in the early 20th century, the
importance of the one-dimensional mechanical resonance as a fundamental model
process was recognized in various fields, at last in engineering mechanics.
There may be various reasons for the enormous time span between the
introduction of this simple mechanical phenomenon into science and its due
scientific appreciation. One of them can be traced back to the frequently made
neglect of friction in the governing equation.

with player-specific affine cost functions $l_{e,i}(x) = a_{e,i} x + b_{e,i}$
is $\mathsf{PPAD}$-complete. To prove that the problem is contained in
$\mathsf{PPAD}$, we develop a homotopy method that traces an equilibrium for
varying flow demands of the players. A key technique for this method is to
describe the evolution of the equilibrium locally by a novel block Laplacian
matrix. Using the properties of this matrix give rise to a path following
formulation for computing an equilibrium where states correspond to supports
that are feasible for some demands. A closer investigation of the block
Laplacian system further allows to orient the states giving rise to unique
predecessor and successor states thus putting the problem into $\mathsf{PPAD}$.
For the $\mathsf{PPAD}$-hardness, we reduce from computing an approximate
equilibrium of a bimatrix win-lose game. As a byproduct of our reduction we
further show that computing a multi-class Wardrop equilibrium with class
dependent affine cost functions is $\mathsf{PPAD}$-complete as well.
  As another byproduct of our $\mathsf{PPAD}$-completeness proof, we obtain an
algorithm that computes a continuum of equilibria parametrized by the players'
flow demand. For player-specific costs, the algorithm runs in polynomial space.
For games with player-independent costs, we obtain an algorithm computing all
equilibria as a function of the flow demand that runs in time polynomial in the
output.

solution in which the BP is applied sequentially over the non-linear model,
akin to what is done by the Gauss-Newton method. The resulting iterative

research for the classification of radio frequency (RF) signals, such as

fundamental challenge is the typically small amount of data available due to
the high costs and resources required for measurements. Small datasets limit
the depth of DNNs implementable, and limit performance. In this work, a novel
method for generating diversified radar micro-Doppler signatures using
Kinect-based motion capture simulations is proposed as a training database for
transfer learning with DNNs. In particular, it is shown that together with
residual learning, the proposed DivNet approach allows for the construction of
deeper neural networks and offers improved performance in comparison to
transfer learning from optical imagery. Furthermore, it is shown that
initializing the network using diversified synthetic micro-Doppler signatures
enables not only robust performance for previously unseen target profiles, but
also class generalization. Results are presented for 7-class and 11-class human

information about the diverse video appearance and dynamics, thus, existing
models that are trained under the standard supervised learning paradigm may
extract less generalizable features. We evaluate these models under a
cross-dataset experiment setting, as the above label bias problem in video
analysis is even more prominent across different data sources. We find that
using the optical flows as model inputs harms the generalization ability of
most video recognition models.
  Based on these findings, we present a multi-task learning paradigm for video
classification. Our key idea is to avoid label bias and improve the
generalization ability by taking data as its own supervision or supervising
constraints on the data. First, we take the optical flows and the RGB frames by
taking them as auxiliary supervisions, and thus naming our model as Reversed
Two-Stream Networks (Rev2Net). Further, we collaborate the auxiliary flow
prediction task and the frame reconstruction task by introducing a new training
objective to Rev2Net, named Decoding Discrepancy Penalty (DDP), which
constraints the discrepancy of the multi-task features in a self-supervised
manner. Rev2Net is shown to be effective on the classic action recognition
task. It specifically shows a strong generalization ability in the
cross-dataset experiments.

knowledge about the structure of these graphs ignore this rich temporal
information when creating representations of the graph. This results in models
which do not perform well when used to make predictions about the future state
of the graph -- especially when the delta between time stamps is not small. In
this work, we explore a novel training procedure and an associated unsupervised
model which creates graph representations optimised to predict the future state
of the graph. We make use of graph convolutional neural networks to encode the
graph into a latent representation, which we then use to train our temporal
offset reconstruction method, inspired by auto-encoders, to predict a later

sample of young, low-gravity objects using the New Technology Telescope (NTT)
and the United Kingdom InfraRed Telescope (UKIRT). Surface gravity is a key
parameter in the atmospheric properties of brown dwarfs and this is the first
large survey that aims to test the gravity dependence of variability
properties. We do a full analysis of the spectral signatures of youth and
assess the group membership probability of each target using membership tools
from the literature. This results in a 30 object sample of young low-gravity
brown dwarfs. Since we are lacking in objects with spectral types later than
L9, we focus our statistical analysis on the L0-L8.5 objects. We find that the
variability occurrence rate of L0-L8.5 low-gravity brown dwarfs in this survey
is $30^{+16}_{-8}\%$. We reanalyse the results of Radigan 2014 and find that
the field dwarfs with spectral types L0-L8.5 have a variability occurrence rate
of $11^{+13}_{-4}\%$. We determine a probability of $98\%$ that the samples are
drawn from different distributions. This is the first quantitative indication
that the low-gravity objects are more likely to be variable than the field
dwarf population. Furthermore, we present follow-up $J_S$ and $K_S$
observations of the young, planetary-mass variable object PSO 318.5-22 over
three consecutive nights. We find no evidence of phase shifts between the $J_S$
and $K_S$ bands and find higher $J_S$ amplitudes. We use the $J_S$ lightcurves
to measure a rotational period of $8.45\pm0.05~$hr for PSO 318.5-22.

Bayesian hypergraphs can model much finer factorizations than Bayesian networks

important especially in the areas of environmental cost-benefit analysis,

valuation estimations has been criticized due to the biases that associated
with methods like the popular contingent valuation method (CVM). In order to
provide alternative valuation results for comparison purpose, we proposed the
possibility of using a method that incorporates fact-based costs and contingent
preferences for evaluating non-use and nonmarket values, which we referred to
as value allotment method (VAM). In this paper, we discussed the economic
principles of VAM, introduced the performing procedure, analyzed assumptions
and potential biases that associated with the method and compared VAM with CVM
through a case study in Guangzhou, China. The case study showed that the VAM
gave more conservative estimates than the CVM, which could be a merit since CVM
often generates overestimated values. We believe that this method can be used
at least as a referential alternative to CVM and might be particularly useful
in assessing the non-use and nonmarket values of ecosystem services from
human-invested ecosystems, such as restored ecosystems, man-made parks and
croplands.

is the primary supermassive black hole candidate. General relativistic
magnetohydrodynamical (GRMHD) simulations of the accretion flow around
Sgr\,A$^*$ predict the presence of sub-structure at observing wavelengths of
$\sim 3$\,mm and below (frequencies of 86\,GHz and above). For very long
baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of Sgr\,A$^*$ at this frequency the
blurring effect of interstellar scattering becomes subdominant, and arrays such
as the High Sensitivity Array (HSA) and the global mm-VLBI Array (GMVA) are now
capable of resolving potential sub-structure in the source. Such investigations
improve our understanding of the emission geometry of the mm-wave emission of
Sgr\,A$^*$, which is crucial for constraining theoretical models and for
providing a background to interpret 1\,mm VLBI data from the Event Horizon
Telescope (EHT). We performed high-sensitivity very long baseline
interferometry (VLBI) observations of Sgr\,A$^*$ at 3\,mm using the Very Long
Baseline Array (VLBA) and the Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT) in Mexico on two
consecutive days in May 2015, with the second epoch including the Green Bank
Telescope (GBT). We find an overall source geometry that matches previous
findings very closely, showing a deviation in fitted model parameters less than
3\% over a time scale of weeks and suggesting a highly stable global source
geometry over time. The reported sub-structure in the 3\,mm emission of
Sgr\,A$^*$ is consistent with theoretical expectations of refractive noise on
long baselines. However, comparing our findings with recent results from 1\,mm
and 7\,mm VLBI observations, which also show evidence for east-west asymmetry,
an intrinsic origin cannot be excluded. Confirmation of persistent intrinsic
substructure will require further VLBI observations spread out over multiple
epochs.

c) live assessment of error budgets and optimisation of adaptive optics
performance; d) optimisation of fringe trackers for long baseline optical
interferometry.
  The ubiquitous deployment of Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensors in large
telescopes makes them central for atmospheric turbulence parameter estimation
via adaptive optics telemetry. Several methods for the estimation of the Fried
parameter and outer scale have been developed, most of which are based on the
fitting of Zernike polynomial coefficients variances reconstructed from the
telemetry. The non-orthogonality of Zernike polynomial derivatives introduces
modal cross coupling, which affects the variances. Furthermore, the finite
resolution of the sensor introduces aliasing.
  In this article the impact of these effects on atmospheric turbulence
parameter estimation is addressed with simulations. It is found that cross
coupling is the dominant bias. An iterative algorithm to overcome it is
presented. Simulations are conducted for typical ranges of the outer scale (4
to 32m), Fried parameter (10 cm) and noise in the variances (signal-to-noise
ratio of 10 and above). It is found that, using the algorithm, both parameters
are recovered with sub-percent accuracy.

and non-merging galaxy clusters. Depending on their morphology and size, we
distinguish between giant radio haloes, which occur predominantly in merging
clusters, and mini haloes, which are found in non-merging, cool-core clusters.
Low-frequency sensitive observations are required to assess whether the
emission discovered in these few cases is common in galaxy clusters or not.
With this aim, we carried out a campaign of observations with the LOw Frequency
ARay (LOFAR) in the frequency range 120 - 168 MHz of nine massive clusters
selected from the \textit{Planck} SZ catalogue, which had no sign of major
mergers. In this paper, we discuss the results of the observations that have
led to the largest cluster sample studied within the LOFAR Two-metre Sky
Survey, and we present Chandra X-ray data used to investigate the dynamical
state of the clusters, verifying that the clusters are currently not undergoing
major mergers, and to search for traces of minor or off-axis mergers. We
discover large-scale steep-spectrum emission around mini haloes in the
cool-core clusters PSZ1G139 and RXJ1720, which is not observed around the mini
halo in the non-cool-core cluster A1413. We also discover a new 570 kpc-halo in

limited understanding of relative strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, existing

local properties determine global properties, optimization algorithms are
unsurprisingly more efficient computationally than sampling algorithms. We
instead examine a class of nonconvex objective functions that arise in mixture

computational complexity of sampling algorithms scales linearly with the model

observed in intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG). Direct cortical
stimulation (DCS) may directly target these oscillations and may serve as
therapeutic approaches to restore functional impairments. However, the presence
of electrical stimulation artifacts in neurophysiological data limits the
analysis of the effects of stimulation. Currently available methods suffer in
performance in the presence of nonstationarity inherent in biological data. Our
algorithm, Shape Adaptive Nonlocal Artifact Removal (SANAR) is based on
unsupervised manifold learning. By estimating the Euclidean median of k nearest
neighbors of each artifact in a nonlocal fashion, we obtain a faithful
representation of the artifact which is then subtracted. This approach
overcomes the challenges presented by nonstationarity. SANAR is effective in
removing stimulation artifacts in the time domain while preserving the spectral
content of the endogenous neurophysiological signal. We demonstrate the
performance in a simulated dataset as well as in human iEEG data. Using two
quantitative measures, that capture how much of information from endogenous
activity is retained, we demonstrate that SANAR's performance exceeds that of
one of the widely used approaches, independent component analysis, in the time
domain as well as the frequency domain. This approach allows for the analysis
of iEEG data, single channel or multiple channels, during DCS, a crucial step

This method allows obtaining the radial structure of the mass-to-light ratio

sample covers a wide range of Hubble types from Sc to E, with stellar masses
ranging from $M_\star \sim 10^{8.4}$ to $10^{12}$ M$_\odot$. The scatter in the
MLCRs was studied as a function of morphology, stellar extinction, and emission
line contribution to the colors. The effects of the initial mass function (IMF)
and stellar population models in the MLCRs were also explored. Our main results
are that (a) the $M/L$ ratio has a negative radial gradient that is steeper
within the central 1 half-light-radius (HLR). It is steeper in Sb-Sbc than in
early-type galaxies. (b) The MLCRs between $M/L$ and optical colors were
derived with a scatter of $\sim$ 0.1 dex. Extinction and emission line
contributions do not affect the scatter of these relations. Morphology does not
produce a significant effect, except if the general relation is used for
galaxies redder than $(u-i) > 4$ or bluer than $(u-i) < 0$. (c) The IMF has a
large effect on MLCRs, as expected. The change from a Chabrier to a Salpeter
IMF produces a median shift of $\sim$ \oimf\ dex when mass loss from stellar
evolution is also taken into account. (d) These MLCRs are in agreement with
previous results, in particular for relations with $g$ and $r$ bands and the
$B$ and $V$ Johnson systems. FITS tables available at http://pycasso.iaa.es/ML

builds up the integrand of the heat kernel. More formally, we demonstrate how
the heat kernel and quasinormal mode methods are linked via the Selberg zeta
function. We show that a 1-loop partition function computed using the heat

quasinormal modes. We discuss how our work may be used to predict quasinormal

distribution functions (PDFs) due to missing higher-order corrections in the
perturbative predictions used in the fit, and their relationship to the
uncertainties in subsequent predictions made using the PDFs. We consider in
particular the standard approach of factorization and renormalization scale
variation, and derive general results for the consistent application of these
at the PDF fit stage. To do this, we use the fact that a PDF fit may be recast
in a physical basis, where the PDFs themselves are bypassed entirely, and one
instead relates measured observables to predicted ones. In the case of
factorization scale variation we find that in various situations there is a
high degree of effective correlation between the variation in the fit and in
predicted observables. In particular, including such a variation in both cases
can lead to an exaggerated theoretical uncertainty. More generally, a careful
treatment of this correlation appears mandatory, at least within the standard
scale variation paradigm. For the renormalization scale, the situation is less
straightforward, but again we highlight the potential for correlations between
related processes in the fit and predictions to enter at the same level as
between processes in the fit or prediction alone.

previously detected CO. A simple semi-analytic model for the evolution of CO, C
and O originating in a volatile-rich planetesimal belt shows how CO shielding
becomes important when the viscous evolution is slow (low $\alpha$ parameter)
and/or the CO production rate is high. Shielding by C$^0$ may also cause the CO
content to reach levels at which CO self-shields, and the gas disc may become
massive enough to affect the dust evolution. Application to the HD 131835
observations shows these can be explained if $\alpha \sim 10^{-3}$; an inner
cavity in C$^0$ and CO may also mean the system has yet to reach steady state.
Application to other debris discs with high CO content finds general agreement
for $\alpha=10^{-3}$ to $0.1$. The shielded secondary nature of these gas discs
can be tested by searching for C$^0$, as well as CN, N$_2$ and CH$^{+}$, which

still an active discussion to understand how they formed. In fact, the spiral
waves observed in discs around young stars can be due to different physical
mechanisms: planet/companion torques, gravitational perturbations or
illumination effects. Aims. We study the spirals formed in the gaseous phase
due to two diametrically opposed shadows cast at fixed disc locations. The
shadows are created by an inclined non-precessing disc inside the cavity, which
is assumed to be optically thick. In particular, we analyse the effect of these
spirals on the dynamics of the dust particles and discuss their detectability
in transition discs. Methods. We perform gaseous hydrodynamical simulations
with shadows, then we compute the dust evolution on top of the gaseous
distribution, and finally we produce synthetic ALMA observations of the dust
emission based on radiative transfer calculations. Results. Our main finding is
that mm- to cm-sized dust particles are efficiently trapped inside the
shadow-triggered spirals. We also observe that particles of various sizes
starting at different stellocentric distances are well mixed inside these
pressure maxima. This dynamical effect would favour grain growth and affect the
resulting composition of planetesimals in the disc. In addition, our radiative
transfer calculations show spiral patterns in the disc at 1.6 {\mu}m and 1.3
mm. Due to their faint thermal emission (compared to the bright inner regions
of the disc) the spirals cannot be detected with ALMA. Our synthetic
observations prove however that shadows are observable as dips in the thermal
emission.

Kubo formalism for viscosity in an external magnetic field, paying particular
attention to the role of rotational symmetry and contact terms. Next, we
compute the conductivity, stress, and viscosity tensors for IQH states in the
presence of a tilted field and vertical confining potential. By comparing our
results with the recently developed bimetric formalism, we show that, at the
level of the contracted Hall viscosity tensor, the mapping between tilted field
and effective mass anisotropy holds only if we simultaneously modify the
background perpendicular magnetic field; in other words, a simultaneous
measurement of the density, contracted Hall viscosity, and Hall conductivity at
fixed particle number can distinguish between tilted field and effective mass
anisotropy. Additionally, we show that in the presence of a tilted magnetic
field, the stress tensor acquires an unusual anisotropic ground state average,
leading to anomalous elastic response functions. We develop a formalism for
projecting a three-dimensional Hamiltonian with confining potential and
magnetic field to a two-dimensional Hamiltonian in order to further address the

for identifying cosmic voids and loops of filaments in cosmological datasets
and assigning their statistical significance using techniques from topological
data analysis. Persistent homology is used to find different dimensional holes.
For dark matter halo catalogs and galaxy surveys, the 0-, 1-, and 2-dimensional
holes can be identified with clusters, loops of filaments, and voids. The
procedure overlays halos/galaxies on a 3D grid, and a distance-to-measure (DTM)
function is calculated at each point of the grid. A filtration is generated
over the lower-level sets of the DTM across increasing threshold values. The
filtered simplicial complex can be used to summarize the birth/death times of
the different dimension homology group generators (i.e., the holes).
Persistence diagrams are produced from the dimension and birth/death times of
each homology group generator. Using the persistence diagrams and bootstrap
sampling, we explain how $p$-values can be assigned to each homology group
generator. The homology group generators on a persistence diagram are not, in
general, uniquely located back in the original dataset volume so we propose a
method for finding a representation of the homology group generators. This
method provides a novel, statistically rigorous approach for locating
informative generators in cosmological datasets, which may be useful for
providing complementary cosmological constraints on the effects of, for

mode's benefits and limitations are not particularly understood. Through the
use of survey studies, prior work has found that most users are either unaware
of private browsing or do not use it. Further, those who do use private
browsing generally have misconceptions about what protection it provides.
However, prior work has not investigated \emph{why} users misunderstand the
benefits and limitations of private browsing. In this work, we do so by
designing and conducting a three-part study: (1) an analytical approach
combining cognitive walkthrough and heuristic evaluation to inspect the user
interface of private mode in different browsers; (2) a qualitative,
interview-based study to explore users' mental models of private browsing and
its security goals; (3) a participatory design study to investigate why
existing browser disclosures, the in-browser explanations of private browsing
mode, do not communicate the security goals of private browsing to users.
Participants critiqued the browser disclosures of three web browsers: Brave,
Firefox, and Google Chrome, and then designed new ones. We find that the user
interface of private mode in different web browsers violates several
well-established design guidelines and heuristics. Further, most participants
had incorrect mental models of private browsing, influencing their
understanding and usage of private mode. Additionally, we find that existing
browser disclosures are not only vague, but also misleading. None of the three
studied browser disclosures communicates or explains the primary security goal
of private browsing. Drawing from the results of our user study, we extract a
set of design recommendations that we encourage browser designers to validate,
in order to design more effective and informative browser disclosures related
to private mode.

measurable quantity that diverges at the critical point -- in this case the
inverse of the shear rate $\dot\gamma_c^{-1}$ at the onset of discontinuous
shear thickening -- as a proxy for packing fraction $\phi$. We obtain an
effective packing fraction for cornstarch and water by fitting
$\dot\gamma_c^{-1}(\phi)$, then invert the function to obtain
$\phi_{eff}(\dot\gamma_c)$. We further include the dependence of
$\dot\gamma_c^{-1}$ on the rheometer gap $d$ to obtain the function
$\phi_{eff}(\dot\gamma_c,d)$. This effective packing fraction $\phi_{eff}$ has
better resolution near the critical point than the raw measured packing
fraction $\phi$ by as much as an order of magnitude. Furthermore, $\phi_{eff}$
normalized by the critical packing fraction $\phi_c$ can be used to compare
rheology data for cornstarch and water suspensions from different lab
environments with different temperature and humidity. This technique can be
straightforwardly generalized to improve resolution in any system with a

presented, implemented within the Automatic Flow Framework for Materials
Discovery (AFLOW), that leverages materials data for the prediction of phase
diagrams and properties of disordered materials. These methods directly address
the issue of materials synthesizability, bridging the gap between simulation
and experiment. Powering these predictions is the AFLOW.org repository for
inorganic crystals, the largest and most comprehensive database of its kind,
containing more than 2 million compounds with about 100 different properties
computed for each. As calculated with standardized parameter sets, the wealth
of data also presents a favorable learning environment. Machine learning
algorithms are employed for property prediction, descriptor development, design
rule discovery, and the identification of candidate functional materials. When
combined with physical models and intelligently formulated descriptors, the
data becomes a powerful tool, facilitating the discovery of new materials for
applications ranging from high-temperature superconductors to thermoelectrics.
These methods have been validated by the synthesis of two new permanent magnets

case of the Spanish past subjunctive, the spontaneous evolution of its two
competing forms (ended in -ra and -se) was perturbed by the appearance of the
Royal Spanish Academy in 1713, which enforced the spelling of both forms as
perfectly interchangeable variants (4), at a moment in which the -ra form was
dominant (5). Time series extracted from a massive corpus of books (6) reveal
that this regulation in fact produced a transient renewed interest for the old
form -se which, once faded, left the -ra again as the dominant form up to the
present day. We show that time series are successfully explained by a
two-dimensional linear model that integrates an imitative and a novelty
component. The model reveals that the temporal scale over which collective
attention fades is in inverse proportion to the verb frequency. The integration
of the two basic mechanisms of imitation and attention to novelty allows to
understand diverse competing objects, with lifetimes that range from hours for
memes and news (7, 8) to decades for verbs, suggesting the existence of a
general mechanism underlying cultural evolution.

storm at Neptune's equator in June 2017. We tracked the storm over a period of
7 months with high-cadence infrared snapshot imaging, carried out on 14 nights
at the 10 meter Keck II telescope and 17 nights at the Shane 120 inch reflector
at Lick Observatory. The cloud feature was larger and more persistent than any
equatorial clouds seen before on Neptune, remaining intermittently active from
at least 10 June to 31 December 2017. Our Keck and Lick observations were
augmented by very high-cadence images from the amateur community, which
permitted the determination of accurate drift rates for the cloud feature. Its
zonal drift speed was variable from 10 June to at least 25 July, but remained a
constant $237.4 \pm 0.2$ m s$^{-1}$ from 30 September until at least 15
November. The pressure of the cloud top was determined from radiative transfer
calculations to be 0.3-0.6 bar; this value remained constant over the course of
the observations. Multiple cloud break-up events, in which a bright cloud band
wrapped around Neptune's equator, were observed over the course of our
observations. No ""dark spot"" vortices were seen near the equator in HST imaging
on 6 and 7 October. The size and pressure of the storm are consistent with
moist convection or a planetary-scale wave as the energy source of convective
upwelling, but more modeling is required to determine the driver of this
equatorial disturbance as well as the triggers for and dynamics of the observed
cloud break-up events.

players optimise multiple, interdependent objectives in parallel -- from GANs

approach to improve learning dynamics in these games, accounting for player
influence on others' updates. Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA)
is a recent algorithm that exploits this response and leads to cooperation in
settings like the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. Although experimentally
successful, we show that LOLA agents can exhibit 'arrogant' behaviour directly
at odds with convergence. In fact, remarkably few algorithms have theoretical
guarantees applying across all (n-player, non-convex) games. In this paper we
present Stable Opponent Shaping (SOS), a new method that interpolates between
LOLA and a stable variant named LookAhead. We prove that LookAhead converges
locally to equilibria and avoids strict saddles in all differentiable games.
SOS inherits these essential guarantees, while also shaping the learning of
opponents and consistently either matching or outperforming LOLA
experimentally.

As an application, we propose a model-free primal-dual Q-learning algorithm to

projective measurements on $O(M^3 \log(M/\delta)/\epsilon^2)$ copies of the
state, where $M$ is the dimension of an associated Lie algebra, $\epsilon$ is a

form the sequence. The number of all computational resources is then polynomial
in $M$, making the whole procedure very efficient in those cases where $M$ is

typically been employed in most of the prior studies. However, flaws in the FCS
method, due to its high sensitivity to the environment, have recently been
evaluated, calling the prior diffusion results into question. It behooves us to
adopt complimentary and direct methods to measure the mobility of enzymes in
solution. Herein, we use a novel technique of direct single-molecule imaging to
observe the diffusion of single enzymes. This technique is less sensitive to
intensity fluctuations and gives the diffusion coefficient directly based on
the trajectory of the enzymes. Our measurements recapitulate that enzyme
diffusion is enhanced in the presence of its substrate and find that the
relative increase in diffusion of a single enzyme is even higher than those
previously reported using FCS. We also use this complementary method to test if
the total enzyme concentration affects the relative increase in diffusion and
if enzyme oligomerization state changes during catalytic turnover. We find that
the diffusion increase is independent of the total background concentration of
enzyme and the catalysis of substrate does not change the oligomerization state
of enzymes.

target labels with gender beyond what one would expect from biased datasets.
Surprisingly, we show that even when datasets are balanced such that each label
co-occurs equally with each gender, learned models amplify the association
between labels and gender, as much as if data had not been balanced! To
mitigate this, we adopt an adversarial approach to remove unwanted features
corresponding to protected variables from intermediate representations in a
deep neural network -- and provide a detailed analysis of its effectiveness.
Experiments on two datasets: the COCO dataset (objects), and the imSitu dataset
(actions), show reductions in gender bias amplification while maintaining most
of the accuracy of the original models.

For a wide range of initial conditions, our approximation predicts that the

derive time-correlation functions of lattice heat currents in terms of
correlation functions among multiple vibrational modes, and subsequently
predict the thermal conductivity based on the Green-Kubo formalism. When the
kinetic transport theories are valid, this FPE not only predicts a thermal
conductivity that is identical to the one predicted by the phonon Boltzmann
transport equation, but also provides additional microscopic details on the
multiple-mode correlation functions. More importantly, when the kinetic
theories become insufficient due to the breakdown of the PG approximation, this
FPE theory remains valid to study the correlation functions among vibrational
modes in highly anharmonic lattices with significant mode-mode interactions
and/or in disordered lattices with strongly localized modes. At the limit of
weak mode-mode interactions, we can adopt quantum perturbation theories to
derive the drift/diffusion coefficients based on the anharmonicity data derived
from first-principles methods. As temperature elevates to the classical regime,
we can perform molecular dynamics simulations to directly compute the
coefficients. Because these coefficients are defined as ensemble averages at
the short time limit, we can implement massive parallel simulation algorithms
to take full advantage of the paralleled high-performance computing platforms.
A better understanding of the temperature-dependent coefficients up to melting
temperatures will provide new insights on microscopic mechanisms that govern

suppression of direct coupling of optical power among cores. The cores,
however, remain mechanically coupled. Inter-core, opto-mechanical cross-talk,
among cores that are otherwise optically isolated from one another, is shown in
this work for the first time. Light in one core stimulates guided acoustic
modes of the entire fiber cladding. These modes, in turn, induce refractive
index perturbations that extend across to other cores. Unlike corresponding
processes in standard fiber, light waves in off-axis cores stimulate general
torsional-radial guided acoustic modes of the cylindrical cross-section.
Hundreds of such modes give rise to inter-core cross-phase modulation, with
broad spectra that are quasi-continuous up to 1 GHz frequency. Inter-core
cross-talk in a commercial, seven-core fiber is studied in both analysis and
experiment. Opto-mechanical cross-talk is quantified in terms of an equivalent
nonlinear coefficient, per acoustic mode or per frequency. The nonlinear

High concentrations of photochemically produced CO and H2 in the otherwise
oxidizing martian atmosphere represent untapped sources of biologically useful
free energy. These out-of-equilibrium species diffuse into the regolith, so
subsurface microbes could use them as a source of energy and carbon. Indeed, CO
oxidation and methanogenesis are relatively simple and evolutionarily ancient
metabolisms on Earth. Consequently, assuming CO- or H2- consuming metabolisms
would evolve on Mars, the persistence of CO and H2 in the martian atmosphere
set limits on subsurface metabolic activity. Here, we constrain such maximum
subsurface metabolic activity on Mars using a 1-D photochemical model with a
hypothetical global biological sink on atmospheric CO and H2. We increase the
biological sink until the model atmospheric composition diverges from observed
abundances. We find maximum biological downward subsurface sinks of 1.5e8
molecules/cm^2/s for CO and 1.9e8 molecules/cm^2/s for H2. These covert to a
maximum metabolizing biomass of <10^27 cells or <2e11 kg, equivalent to <1e-4
to 1e-5 of Earth's biomass, depending on the terrestrial estimate. Diffusion
calculations suggest this upper biomass limit applies to the top few kilometers
of the martian crust in communication with the atmosphere at low to mid
latitudes. This biomass limit is more robust than previous estimates because we
test multiple possible chemoautotrophic ecosystems over a broad parameter space
of tunable model variables using an updated photochemical model with precise
atmospheric concentrations and uncertainties from Curiosity. Our results of
sparse or absent life in the martian subsurface also demonstrate how the
atmospheric redox pairs of CO-O2 and H2-O2 may constitute antibiosignatures,
which may be relevant to excluding life on exoplanets.

for a variety of neural interfacing applications, due to its unique combination
of high conductivity, bioinertness, and durability. One emerging application
for N-UNCD is as a photoelectrode material for high-precision optical neural
stimulation. This may be used for the treatment of neurological disorders and
for implantable bionic devices such as cochlear ear implants and retinal
prostheses. N-UNCD is a well-suited material for stimulation photoelectrodes,
exhibiting a photocurrent response to light at visible wavelengths with a high
charge injection density [A. Ahnood, A. N. Simonov, J. S. Laird, M. I.
Maturana, K. Ganesan, A. Stacey, M. R. Ibbotson, L. Spiccia, and S. Prawer,
Appl. Phys. Lett. 108, 104103 (2016)]. In this study, the photoresponse of
N-UNCD to near-infrared (NIR) irradiation is measured. NIR light has greater
optical penetration through tissue than visible wavelengths, opening the
possibility to stimulate previously inaccessible target cells. It is found that
N-UNCD exhibits a photoresponsivity which diminishes rapidly with increasing
wavelength and is attributed to transitions between mid-gap states and the
conduction band tail associated with the graphitic phase present at the grain
boundaries. Oxygen surface termination on the diamond films provides further
enhancement of the injected charge per photon, compared to as-grown or hydrogen
terminated surfaces. Based on the measured injected charge density, we estimate
that the generated photocurrent of oxygen terminated N-UNCD is sufficient to
achieve extracellular stimulation of brain tissue within the safe optical
exposure limit.

flow through the network while facing path transportation costs, and an
interdictor who simultaneously interdicts one or more edges while facing edge
interdiction costs. Using our existence result on posets and strict
complementary slackness in linear programming, we show that the Nash equilibria
of this game can be fully described using primal and dual solutions of a

sources within 0.1 pc (two of them associated with the known accretion outburst
YSOs RNO 1C and RNO 1B). The dense gas tracer DCN (3--2) traces well the dust
continuum emission and shows a clear velocity gradient along the NW-SE
direction centered at SMA3. There is another velocity gradient with opposite
direction around the most luminous YSO IRAS 00338+6312. The fragmentation
within 0.1 pc in L1287 is very high compared to other regions at the same
spatial scales. The incoherent motions of dense gas flows are sometimes
interpreted by being influenced by (proto)stellar feedback (e.g., outflows),
which is not yet ruled out in this particular target source. The directions of
the velocity gradients traced by DCN are approximately perpendicular to those
of the dominant CO outflow(s). Therefore, we alternatively hypothesize that the
velocity gradients revealed by DCN trace the convergence from the $\gtrsim$0.1
pc scales infalling motion towards the rotational motions around the more
compact ($\sim0.02$ pc) sources. This global molecular gas converging flow may
feed the formation of the dense low-mass YSO cluster. IRAS 00338+6312 is the
most likely powering source of the dominant CO outflow. A compact blue-shifted
outflow from RNO 1C is also identified.

enhancement by framing it as a data-driven pattern recognition problem. In many
modern enhancement systems, large amounts of data are used to train a deep
network to estimate masks for complex-valued short-time Fourier transforms
(STFTs) to suppress noise and preserve speech. However, current masking
approaches often neglect two important constraints: STFT consistency and
mixture consistency. Without STFT consistency, the system's output is not
necessarily the STFT of a time-domain signal, and without mixture consistency,
the sum of the estimated sources does not necessarily equal the input mixture.
Furthermore, the only previous approaches that apply mixture consistency use
real-valued masks; mixture consistency has been ignored for complex-valued
masks. In this paper, we show that STFT consistency and mixture consistency can
be jointly imposed by adding simple differentiable projection layers to the
enhancement network. These layers are compatible with real or complex-valued
masks. Using both of these constraints with complex-valued masks provides a 0.7
dB increase in scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) on a large
dataset of speech corrupted by a wide variety of nonstationary noise across a
range of input SNRs.

population exhibits patterns of consensus, dominance, and, importantly,
different types of polarisation, a more diverse dynamical environment that
contrasts with single simple contagion processes. We show how these patterns
emerge and how different population structures modify them through a natural
development of spatial correlations: structured interactions increase the range
of the dominance regime by reducing that of dynamic polarisation, tight modular
structures can generate structural polarisation, depending on the interplay

radiative transfer equations for a gray atmosphere in the Eddington
approximation, accounting for the polarization induced by a strong magnetic
field. The solutions show the formation of a hot external layer and a low
(uniform) temperature atmospheric interior. This suggests that the emergent
spectrum may be described by a single blackbody with the likely formation of a
optical/infrared excess (below ~ 1 eV). We also found that the polarization is
strongly dependent on both the luminosity and penetration length of the
particle bombardment. Therefore, the thermal emission from active sources, such

incorrect with probability $\epsilon$. We show that Bob should always ask
Carole whether the index of $X$ is odd or even with respect to a descending
order of probabilities -- this question simultaneously minimizes all the

settles a conjecture of Burin and Shayevitz. We further consider a more general

problem of testing whether a given question is optimal appears to be generally
difficult in other symmetric channels. We provide supporting evidence for this
difficulty, by showing that a core property required in our proofs becomes
NP-hard to test in the general $M$-ary case. We establish this hardness result

single-exponential time algorithm for the Closest Vector Problem (CVP) on
lattices. It is based on the computation of the Voronoi cell of the given
lattice and thus may need exponential space as well. We address the major open
question whether there exists such an algorithm that requires only polynomial
space.
  To this end, we define a lattice basis to be $c$-compact if every facet
normal of the Voronoi cell is a linear combination of the basis vectors using
coefficients that are bounded by $c$ in absolute value. Given such a basis, we
get a polynomial space algorithm for CVP whose running time naturally depends
on $c$. Thus, our main focus is the behavior of the smallest possible value of
$c$, with the following results: There always exist $c$-compact bases, where
$c$ is bounded by $n^2$ for an $n$-dimension lattice; there are lattices not
admitting a $c$-compact basis with $c$ growing sublinearly with the dimension;
and every lattice with a zonotopal Voronoi cell has a $1$-compact basis.

Here we propose to use recurrent connections within the convolutional layers to
make networks robust against pixel noise such as could arise from imaging at
low light levels, and thereby significantly increase their performance when
tested with simulated noisy video sequences. We show that cCNNs classify images
with high signal to noise ratios (SNRs) well, but are easily outperformed when

integrate multiple image frames still does not match gruCNN performance.
Additionally, we show that at low SNRs, the probabilities predicted by the

censorship conjecture might arise for spacetimes inheriting Cauchy horizon
along with a positive cosmological constant. We have explicitly demonstrated
that violation of the censorship conjecture holds true in the presence of a

for a higher dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m-de Sitter black hole the
violation of cosmic censorship conjecture is at a larger scale compared to the
four dimensional one, for certain choices of the cosmological constant. On the
other hand, for a brane world black hole, the effect of extra dimension is to
make the violation of cosmic censorship conjecture weaker. For rotating black

create a family of increasingly tight convex relaxations for binary programs.
There are several problems for which a constant number of rounds of this
hierarchy give integrality gaps matching the best known approximation
algorithms. For many other problems, however, ad-hoc techniques give better
approximation ratios than \sos{} in the worst case, as shown by corresponding
lower bound instances. Notably, in many cases these instances are invariant
under the action of a large permutation group. This yields the question how
symmetries in a formulation degrade the performance of the relaxation obtained
by the \sos{} hierarchy. In this paper, we study this for the case of the
minimum makespan problem on identical machines. Our first result is to show
that $\Omega(n)$ rounds of \sos{} applied over the \emph{configuration linear
program} yields an integrality gap of at least $1.0009$, where $n$ is the
number of jobs. Our result is based on tools from representation theory of
symmetric groups. Then, we consider the weaker \emph{assignment linear program}
and add a well chosen set of symmetry breaking inequalities that removes a
subset of the machine permutation symmetries. We show that applying
$2^{\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^2)}$ rounds of the SA hierarchy to this stronger
linear program reduces the integrality gap to $1+\varepsilon$, which yields a
linear programming based polynomial time approximation scheme. Our results
suggest that for this classical problem, symmetries were the main barrier
preventing the \sos{}/ SA hierarchies to give relaxations of polynomial
complexity with an integrality gap of~$1+\varepsilon$. We leave as an open
question whether this phenomenon occurs for other symmetric problems.

between the higher-lying open loops and lower-lying closed loops took place,
and two sets of newly reconnected loops formed. Thereafter, cooling and
condensations of coronal plasma occurred in the magnetic dip region of
higher-lying open loops. During the reconnection process, disturbances
originating from the reconnection region propagate upward across the magnetic
dip region of higher-lying loops with the mean speed and mean speed amplitude
of 200 and 30 km s$^{-1}$, respectively. The mean speed of the propagating
disturbances decreases from $\sim$230 km s$^{-1}$ to $\sim$150 km s$^{-1}$
during the coronal condensation process, and then increases to $\sim$220 km

similar to a given image and style similar to another. Although recent
feed-forward neural networks can generate stylized images in real-time, these
models produce a single stylization given a pair of style/content images, and
the user doesn't have control over the synthesized output. Moreover, the style
transfer depends on the hyper-parameters of the model with varying ""optimum""
for different input images. Therefore, if the stylized output is not appealing
to the user, she/he has to try multiple models or retrain one with different
hyper-parameters to get a favorite stylization. In this paper, we address these
issues by proposing a novel method which allows adjustment of crucial
hyper-parameters, after the training and in real-time, through a set of
manually adjustable parameters. These parameters enable the user to modify the
synthesized outputs from the same pair of style/content images, in search of a
favorite stylized image. Our quantitative and qualitative experiments indicate
how adjusting these parameters is comparable to retraining the model with
different hyper-parameters. We also demonstrate how these parameters can be
randomized to generate results which are diverse but still very similar in

first, and then meets the higher-lying one. Thereafter, both of them erupt
together. The filament eruption draws the overlying magnetic field lines
upward, leading to the approach of two legs, with opposite magnetic polarities,
of the overlying field lines. Two sets of bright CSs form at the interface of
these two legs, and magnetic reconnection takes place in the CSs producing the

in the CSs, and propagate along the CSs bi-directionally. The CSs and plasmoids

  Synchronization",,,,,"cs.CR cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Clock synchronization has become essential to modern societies since many
critical infrastructures depend on a precise notion of time. This paper
analyzes security aspects of high-precision clock synchronization protocols,
particularly their alleged protection against delay attacks when clock
synchronization traffic is encrypted using standard network security protocols
such as IPsec, MACsec, or TLS. We use the Precision Time Protocol (PTP), the
most widely used protocol for high-precision clock synchronization, to
demonstrate that statistical traffic analysis can identify properties that
support selective message delay attacks even for encrypted traffic. We
furthermore identify a fundamental conflict in secure clock synchronization
between the need of deterministic traffic to improve precision and the need to
obfuscate traffic in order to mitigate delay attacks.
  A theoretical analysis of clock synchronization protocols isolates the
characteristics that make these protocols vulnerable to delay attacks and
argues that such attacks cannot be prevented entirely but only be mitigated.
Knowledge of the underlying communication network in terms of one-way delays
and knowledge on physical constraints of these networks can help to compute
guaranteed maximum bounds for slave clock offsets. These bounds are essential
for detecting delay attacks and minimizing their impact. In the general case,
however, the precision that can be guaranteed in adversarial settings is orders
of magnitude lower than required for high-precision clock synchronization in
critical infrastructures, which, therefore, must not rely on a precise notion
of time when using untrusted networks.

2014 August 24. Two jets (jet1 and jet2) were related to the flare. Jet1
appeared first. Jet2 appeared 6 minutes later. During its initial phase, a big
plasmoid was ejected out of jet2. After the flare peak time, multiple bright
and compact blobs appeared in the lower part of jet2, which were observed by
IRIS/SJI. The blobs observed by SJI in 1330 {\AA} have sizes of
0$\farcs$45$-$1$\farcs$35, nearly 84\% of which are subarcsecond ($<$1\arcsec).
The mean value and standard deviation of the sizes are 0$\farcs$78 and
0$\farcs$19, respectively. The velocities of the blobs range from 10 to more
than 220 km s$^{-1}$. Three of the blobs had their counterparts in EUV
wavelengths observed by SDO/AIA. The velocities are almost identical in UV and
EUV wavelengths. We propose that the blobs observed in 1330 {\AA} are the cool

component of several MK. In jet1, only one blob was present. We conclude that
the blobs are created by the tearing-mode instability of the current sheet at

uncovering the fine structures of coronal jets and understanding the

examples. Starting with the expressions for linear FSMs in straight cylinders,
we synthesize the specific intensities and spectral profiles for the two
spectral lines by incorporating the self-consistently derived ionic fractions
in the relevant contribution functions. We find that relative to the case where
Equilibrium Ionization (EI) is assumed, NEI considerably impacts the intensity
modulations, but shows essentially no effect on the Doppler velocities or
widths. Furthermore, NEI may affect the phase difference between intensity
variations and those in Doppler widths for Fe XII 193 \AA\ when the
line-of-sight is oblique to the loop axis. While this difference is $180^\circ$
when EI is assumed, it is $\sim 90^\circ$ when NEI is incorporated for the
parameters we choose. We conclude that in addition to viewing angles and
instrumental resolutions, NEI further complicates the detection of FSMs in
spectroscopic measurements of coronal loops in the EUV passband.

practice, mining power is quite concentrated. This fact is a persistent source
of concern for the Bitcoin community.
  We provide an explanation using a simple model to capture miners' incentives
to invest in equipment. In our model, $n$ miners compete for a prize of fixed
size. Each miner chooses an investment $q_i$, incurring cost $c_i q_i$, and
then receives reward $\frac{q_i^\alpha}{\sum_j q_j^\alpha}$, for some $\alpha
\geq 1$. When $c_i = c_j$ for all $i,j$, and $\alpha = 1$, there is a unique
equilibrium where all miners invest equally. However, we prove that under
seemingly mild deviations from this model, equilibrium outcomes become
drastically more centralized. In particular, (a) When costs are asymmetric, if
miner $i$ chooses to invest, then miner $j$ has market share at least
$1-\frac{c_j}{c_i}$. That is, if miner $j$ has costs that are (e.g.) $20\%$
lower than those of miner $i$, then miner $j$ must control at least $20\%$ of
the \emph{total} mining power. (b) In the presence of economies of scale
($\alpha > 1$), every market participant has a market share of at least
$1-\frac{1}{\alpha}$, implying that the market features at most
$\frac{\alpha}{\alpha - 1}$ miners in total.

designed to discriminate real rainy images from fake rainy images which are
created based on outputs of the generator with BGM. Simultaneously, the BGM

population of cost-minimizing EV owners traveling and charging within a
transportation network equipped with fast charging stations (FCSs).
Specifically, we study how the charging network operator (CNO) can influence
where EV users charge in order to optimize the utilization of fast charging
stations. These charging decisions of private EV owners affect aggregate
congestion at stations (i.e., waiting time) as well as the aggregate EV
charging load across the network. In this work, we capture the resulting
equilibrium wait times and electricity load through a so-called \textit{traffic
and charge assignment problem} (TCAP) in a fast charging station network. Our
formulation allows us to: 1) Study the expected station wait times as well as
the probability distribution of aggregate charging load of EVs in a FCS network
in a mobility-aware fashion (an aspect unique to our work), while accounting
for heterogeneities in users' travel patterns, energy demands, and
geographically variant electricity prices. 2) Analytically characterize the
special threshold-based structure that determines how EV owners choose where to
charge their vehicle at equilibrium, in response to the FCS's charging price
structure, users' energy demands, and users' mobility patterns. 3) Provide a
convex optimization problem formulation to identify the network's unique
equilibrium. Furthermore, we illustrate how to induce a socially optimal
charging behavior by deriving the socially optimal plug-in fees and electricity
prices at the charging stations.

generation of spin current, which should enable the efficient manipulation of

The effective spin conductivity corresponding to the SOT turns out to be almost

thus incapable of preserving cross-domain category consistency, as the
pseudo-labeling accuracy is not guaranteed explicitly. In this paper, we
propose the Progressive Feature Alignment Network (PFAN) to align the
discriminative features across domains progressively and effectively, via
exploiting the intra-class variation in the target domain. To be specific, we
first develop an Easy-to-Hard Transfer Strategy (EHTS) and an Adaptive
Prototype Alignment (APA) step to train our model iteratively and
alternatively. Moreover, upon observing that a good domain adaptation usually
requires a non-saturated source classifier, we consider a simple yet efficient
way to retard the convergence speed of the source classification loss by
further involving a temperature variate into the soft-max function. The
extensive experimental results reveal that the proposed PFAN exceeds the
state-of-the-art performance on three UDA datasets.

$\lambda$-choosable is equivalent to $k$-colourable. For the other partitions

analysis, GAP is capable of adapting to different network structures,

after pruning to restore the model performance. In the finetuning step, we
adopt a self-taught knowledge distillation (KD) strategy by utilizing
information from the original model, through which, the performance of the
optimized model can be sufficiently improved, without introduction of any other
teacher model. Experimental results show the proposed GAP can achieve promising
result to make inference more efficient, e.g., for ResNeXt-29 on CIFAR10, it
can get 13X model compression and 4.3X practical speed-up with marginal loss of

micromagnetic calculation, we have discovered a novel dynamic mode, the sway
mode, of DWs under an out-of-plane high-frequency alternating current (AC)

information regarding the direction and time of the emitted 14 MeV neutron.
Inelastic neutron scattering leads to characteristic gamma-ray emission from
certain isotopes, for example C-12, that can be correlated with the neutron

simulations, and first experimental results. The alpha detector consists of a
Yttrium Aluminum Perovskite (YAP) scintillator mounted on the inside of a
neutron generator tube. The scintillation light propagates through a sapphire
window to a position-sensitive photomultiplier tube mounted on the outside. The
16x16 output signals are connected through a resistive network for a 4-corner

for the calculation of the alpha position. First test results demonstrate that
an excellent alpha position resolution, better than the 1 mm FWHM required by

Instead, we present a novel virtual Try-On network, M2E-Try On Net, which
transfers the clothes from a model image to a person image without the need of
any clean product images. To obtain a realistic image of person wearing the
desired model clothes, we aim to solve the following challenges: 1) non-rigid
nature of clothes - we need to align poses between the model and the user; 2)
richness in textures of fashion items - preserving the fine details and
characteristics of the clothes is critical for photo-realistic transfer; 3)
variation of identity appearances - it is required to fit the desired model
clothes to the person identity seamlessly. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce three key components, including the pose alignment network (PAN), the
texture refinement network (TRN) and the fitting network (FTN). Since it is
unlikely to gather image pairs of input person image and desired output image
(i.e. person wearing the desired clothes), our framework is trained in a
self-supervised manner to gradually transfer the poses and textures of the
model's clothes to the desired appearance. In the experiments, we verify on the
Deep Fashion dataset and MVC dataset that our method can generate
photo-realistic images for the person to try-on the model clothes. Furthermore,
we explore the model capability for different fashion items, including both
upper and lower garments.

with the Infrared Medium-deep Survey (IMS), which covers $\sim100$ deg$^{2}$
areas in $J$-band to the depths of $J_{\rm AB}\sim23$ mag. To improve selection
methods, the medium-band follow-up imaging has been carried out using the SED
camera for QUasars in Early uNiverse (SQUEAN) on the Otto Struve 2.1 m
Telescope. The optical spectra of the candidates were obtained with 8-m class
telescopes. We newly discovered 10 quasars with $-25<M_{1450}<-23$ at $z\sim5$,
among which three have been missed in a previous survey using the same optical
data over the same area, implying the necessity for improvements in high
redshift faint quasars selection. We derived photometric redshifts from the
medium-band data, and find that they have high accuracies of $\langle|\Delta

discretizations of partial differential equations are coupled with explicit
time integration methods. Unfortunately, for many problems this can result in
severe time-step restrictions. The techniques used to develop explicit
positivity preserving DG discretizations can, however, not easily be combined
with implicit time integration methods. In this paper we therefore present a
new approach. Using Lagrange multipliers the conditions imposed by the
positivity preserving limiters are directly coupled to a DG discretization
combined with a Diagonally Implicit Runge-Kutta time integration method. The
positivity preserving DG discretization is then reformulated as a
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) problem, which is frequently encountered in
constrained optimization. Since the limiter is only active in areas where
positivity must be enforced it does not affect the higher order DG
discretization elsewhere. The resulting non-smooth nonlinear algebraic

optimization problems. We therefore develop an efficient active set semi-smooth
Newton method that is suitable for the KKT formulation of time-implicit
positivity preserving DG discretizations. Convergence of this semi-smooth

of the time-implicit positivity preserving DG discretization. The time-implicit

scalar conservation laws, which include the advection, Burgers, Allen-Cahn,
Barenblatt, and Buckley-Leverett equations.

discriminative across categories and polymerized within classes, is a
significant challenge in 3D shape retrieval. Most existing 3D shape retrieval
methods focus on capturing strong discriminative shape representation with
softmax loss for the classification task, while the shape feature learning with
metric loss is neglected for 3D shape retrieval. In this paper, we address this
problem based on the intuition that the cosine distance of shape embeddings
should be close enough within the same class and far away across categories.
Since most of 3D shape retrieval tasks use cosine distance of shape features
for measuring shape similarity, we propose a novel metric loss named angular
triplet-center loss, which directly optimizes the cosine distances between the
features. It inherits the triplet-center loss property to achieve larger
inter-class distance and smaller intra-class distance simultaneously. Unlike
previous metric loss utilized in 3D shape retrieval methods, where Euclidean
distance is adopted and the margin design is difficult, the proposed method is
more convenient to train feature embeddings and more suitable for 3D shape
retrieval. Moreover, the angle margin is adopted to replace the cosine margin
in order to provide more explicit discriminative constraints on an embedding
space. Extensive experimental results on two popular 3D object retrieval
benchmarks, ModelNet40 and ShapeNetCore 55, demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed loss, and our method has achieved state-of-the-art results on
various 3D shape datasets.

(PCEB) DE CVn. Based on new CCD photometric observations and the published

oscillation with an amplitude of $28.08$ s and a period of $11.22$ years plus a
rapid period decrease at a rate of $\dot{P}=-3.35\times10^{-11}ss^{-1}$.
According to the evolutionary theory, secular period decreases in PCEBs arise
from angular momentum losses (AMLs) driven by gravitational radiation (GR) and
magnetic braking (MB). However, the observed orbital decay is too fast to be
produced by AMLs via GR and MB, indicating that there could be other AML
mechanism. We suggest that a circumbinary disk around DE CVn may be responsible
for the additional AML. The disk mass was derived as a
few$\times$$10^{-4}$-$10^{-3}$$M_{\odot}$ , which is in agreement with that
inferred from previous studies in the order of magnitude. The cyclic change is
most likely result of the gravitational perturbation by a circumbinary object
due to the Applegate's mechanism fails to explain such a large period
oscillation. The mass of the potential third body is calculated as
$M_{3}\sin{i'}=0.011(\pm0.003)M_{\odot}$. Supposing the circumbinary companion
and the eclipsing binary is coplanar, its mass would correspond to a giant
planet. This hypothetical giant planet is moving in a circular orbit of radius
$\sim5.75(\pm2.02)$ AU around its host star.

is the gap structures depending on the angular momentum $j_z$ of normal Bloch

violent merger scenario of the double-degenerate model, in which a
thermonuclear explosion could be produced when the merging of double
carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs) is still ongoing. It has been recently
found that the nucleus of the bipolar planetary nebula Henize 2-428 consists of
double CO WDs that have a total mass of ~1.76Msun, a mass ratio of ~1 and an
orbital period of ~4.2 hours, which is the first and only discovered progenitor
candidate of SNe Ia predicted by the violent merger scenario. In this work, we
aim to reproduce the evolutionary history of the central double CO WDs of
Henize 2-428. We find that the planetary nebula Henize 2-428 may originate from
a primordial binary that have a ~5.4Msun primary and a ~2.7Msun secondary with
an initial orbital period of ~15.9 days. The double CO WDs are formed after the
primordial binary experiencing two Roche-lobe overflows and two common-envelope
ejection processes. According to our calculations, it takes about ~840 Myr for
the double CO WDs to merge and form an SN Ia driven by the gravitational wave
radiation after their birth. To produce the current status of Henize 2-428, a
large common-envelope parameter is needed. We also estimate that the rate of
SNe Ia from the violent merger scenario is at most 2.9*10-4 yr-1, and that the
delay time is in the range of ~90 Myr to the Hubble time.

progress of ConvNets. As a result, the key application characteristics such as
frames-per-second (FPS) are ignored in favor of simply counting GOPs, and
results on accuracy, which is critical to application success, are often not
even reported. In this work, we adopt an algorithm-hardware co-design approach
to develop a ConvNet accelerator called Synetgy and a novel ConvNet model
called DiracDeltaNet$^{\dagger}$. Both the accelerator and ConvNet are tailored
to FPGA requirements. DiracDeltaNet, as the name suggests, is a ConvNet with
only $1\times 1$ convolutions while spatial convolutions are replaced by more
efficient shift operations. DiracDeltaNet achieves competitive accuracy on
ImageNet (88.7\% top-5), but with 42$\times$ fewer parameters and 48$\times$
fewer OPs than VGG16. We further quantize DiracDeltaNet's weights to 4-bit and
activations to 4-bits, with less than 1\% accuracy loss. These quantizations
exploit well the nature of FPGA hardware. In short, DiracDeltaNet's small model
size, low computational OP count, low precision and simplified operators allow
us to co-design a highly customized computing unit for an FPGA. We implement
the computing units for DiracDeltaNet on an Ultra96 SoC system through
high-level synthesis. Our accelerator's final top-5 accuracy of 88.1\% on
ImageNet, is higher than all the previously reported embedded FPGA
accelerators. In addition, the accelerator reaches an inference speed of 66.3
FPS on the ImageNet classification task, surpassing prior works with similar
accuracy by at least 11.6$\times$.

may collapse into neutron stars. However, the off-centre carbon burning is
still incompletely understood, especially when the inwardly propagating burning
wave reaches the centre. In this paper, we aim to investigate the propagating
characteristics of burning waves and the subsequently evolutionary outcomes of
these CO cores. We simulated the long-term evolution of CO WDs that accrete
CO-rich material by employing the stellar evolution code MESA on the basis of
the thick-disc assumption. We found that the final outcomes of CO WDs strongly
depend on Macc (Msun/yr) based on the thick-disc assumption, which can be
divided into four regions: (1) explosive carbon ignition in the centre, then
SNe Ia (Macc < 2.45*10^-6); (2) OSi cores, then neutron stars (2.45*10^-6 <

observational evidence of the disk-jet connection in accreting compact objects.
However, a growing number of X-ray binaries seem to present deviations from the
universal radio/X-ray correlation and the origin of these outliers are still
very much debated. In previous studies, the X-ray bolometric luminosity used in
the radio/X-ray correlation has been estimated using a narrow, soft X-ray band.
We study how estimating the X-ray bolometric luminosity using broadband
observations of X-ray binaries affects the radio/X-ray correlation. We found
that the ratio between the broadband (3-200 keV) and narrowband (3-9 keV)
luminosities varies between 5-10 in the hard X-ray state. Overall, the
resulting radio/X-ray correlation slopes and normalizations did not present a
very significant change suggesting that they are not affected greatly by
observational biases but are caused by real physical effects. We found that all
sources that reach high enough luminosity change their correlation slopes from
the universal slope to a much steeper one. In addition, sources in the steeper
radio/X-ray track show a distinct cutoff in the high energy X-ray spectrum at
tens of keV. These results suggest that the accretion flow presents a
morphological change at a certain critical luminosity during the outburst rise
from radiatively inefficient to radiatively efficient flow that is in turn more
efficient in cooling the hot accretion flow producing the hard X-ray emission.
This change could also affect to the jet launching properties in these systems.

astronomical objects have variety in shape from point sources, diffuse sources

remains formulated as a semantic segmentation problem. This approach, however,
only indirectly solves the coarse localization task by predicting pixel-level
scores, requiring ad-hoc heuristics when mapping back to object-level scores.
State-of-the-art object detectors on the other hand, allow for individual
object scoring in an end-to-end fashion, while ironically trading in the
ability to exploit the full pixel-wise supervision signal. This can be
particularly disadvantageous in the setting of medical image analysis, where
data sets are notoriously small. In this paper, we propose Retina U-Net, a
simple architecture, which naturally fuses the Retina Net one-stage detector
with the U-Net architecture widely used for semantic segmentation in medical
images. The proposed architecture recaptures discarded supervision signals by
complementing object detection with an auxiliary task in the form of semantic
segmentation without introducing the additional complexity of previously
proposed two-stage detectors. We evaluate the importance of full segmentation
supervision on two medical data sets, provide an in-depth analysis on a series
of toy experiments and show how the corresponding performance gain grows in the
limit of small data sets. Retina U-Net yields strong detection performance only
reached by its more complex two-staged counterparts. Our framework including

observational signatures of disk turbulence. Methods. We introduced PAH and
grain charging physics and their interplay with other gas-phase reactions in
the physico-chemical code ProDiMo. Non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics effects such
as Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion are parametrized to derive an effective value
for the turbulent parameter alpha_eff . We explored the effects of turbulence
heating and line broadening on CO isotopologue sub-millimeter lines. Results.
The spatial distribution of alpha_eff depends on various unconstrained disk
parameters such as the magnetic parameter beta_mag or the cosmic ray density
distribution inside the protoplanetary disks. The inner disk midplane shows the
presence of the so-called dead-zone where the turbulence is quasi-inexistent.
The disk is heated mostly by thermal accommodation on dust grains in the
dead-zone, by viscous heating outside the dead-zone up to a few hundred
astronomical units, and by chemical heating in the outer disk. The CO
rotational lines probe the warm molecular disk layers where the turbulence is
at its maximum. However, the effect of turbulence on the CO line profiles is
minimal and difficult to distinguish from the thermal broadening. Conclusions.
Viscous heating of the gas in the disk midplane outside the dead-zone is
efficient. The determination of alpha from CO rotational line observations
alone is challenging.

noiseless amplification is indeed possible, provided that the states which we
wish to amplify come from a finite set. Perfect amplification with unlimited
average gain is then possible with finite success probability, for example
using techniques for unambiguously distinguishing between quantum states. Such
realizations require only linear optics, no single-photon sources, nor any
photon counting. We also investigate the optimal success probability of perfect
amplification of a symmetric set of coherent states. There are two regimes:
low-amplitude amplification, where the target amplitude is below one, and
general amplification. For the low-amplitude regime, analytic results for the
optimal amplification success probabilities can be obtained. In this case a
natural bound imposed by the ratio of success probabilities of optimal
unambiguous discrimination of the source and amplified states can always be
reached. We also show that for general amplification this bound cannot always
be satisfied.

to the point of complete collapse. Yet, the interplay between network topology

study how topology affects the redistribution of flow after the failure of a
single link in linear flow networks with a special focus on power grids. In
particular, we analyze the decay of flow changes with distance after a link
failure and map it to the field of an electrical dipole for lattice-like
networks. The corresponding inverse-square law is shown to hold for all regular
tilings. For sparse networks, a long-range response is found instead. In the
case of more realistic topologies, we introduce a rerouting distance, which
captures the decay of flow changes better than the traditional geodesic
distance. Finally, we are able to derive rigorous bounds on the strength of the
decay for arbitrary topologies that we verify through extensive numerical
simulations. Our results show that it is possible to forecast flow rerouting
after link failures to a large extent based on purely topological measures and
that these effects generally decay with distance from the failing link. They
might be used to predict links prone to failure in supply networks such as
power grids and thus help to construct grids providing a more robust and
reliable power supply.

causing photospheric spectral lines to exhibit a differential line shift. This
Doppler shift to shorter wavelength is commonly known as convective blueshift.
We performed systematic observations of the quiet Sun with the Laser Absolute
Reference Spectrograph (LARS) at the German Vacuum Tower Telescope. The solar
disk was scanned along the meridian and the equator, from the disk center
toward the limb. The solar spectrum around 6173{\AA} was calibrated with a
laser frequency comb on an absolute wavelength scale with an accuracy of a few
m/s. We applied a bisector analysis on the spectral lines to reveal the changes
of convective blueshift and line asymmetry at different heliocentric positions.
Being a signature for convective motions, the bisector curve of Fe i
6173.3{\AA} describes a C-shape at disk center. When approaching the solar
limb, the bisector transforms into a \-shape. The analysis of the time- and
bisector-averaged line shifts yields three distinct results. Firstly, the
center-to-limb variation of Doppler velocities measured with LARS reveals a
significant discrepancy (up to 200m/s) to the full-disk Dopplergrams of the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). Secondly, we obtained a significant
decrease of convective blueshift toward the solar limb. Thirdly, the
line-of-sight effect of solar activity leads to a scatter of up to 100m/s at
intermediate heliocentric positions. The accurate observation of the absolute
convective blueshift with LARS allows the identification of systematic
discrepancy with Doppler velocities measured by HMI. The center-to-limb
variation of HMI suffers from an additional blueshift toward the limb that is
incompatible with our results. LARS measurements can be taken as reference for
the correction of systematic errors in the synoptic HMI Dopplergrams.

learning has gained attention in the era of deep learning and big data. Markov
Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) methods typically implement Bayesian inference which
faces several challenges given a large number of parameters, complex and
multimodal posterior distributions, and computational complexity of large
neural network models. Parallel tempering MCMC addresses some of these
limitations given that they can sample multimodal posterior distributions and
utilize high-performance computing. However, certain challenges remain given
large neural network models and big data. Surrogate-assisted optimization
features the estimation of an objective function for models which are
computationally expensive. In this paper, we address the inefficiency of
parallel tempering MCMC for large-scale problems by combining parallel
computing features with surrogate assisted likelihood estimation that describes
the plausibility of a model parameter value, given specific observed data.
Hence, we present surrogate-assisted parallel tempering for Bayesian neural
learning for simple to computationally expensive models. Our results
demonstrate that the methodology significantly lowers the computational cost
while maintaining quality in decision making with Bayesian neural networks. The
method has applications for a Bayesian inversion and uncertainty quantification

approach is typified by several limitations that raise doubts for the

Benefits are twofold: single research institutions can maximize the probability

research. At the same time, broader adoptions of this approach could also
provide strong advantages at the macroeconomic level, since it guarantees
financial allocations based on the real value of the institutions under

respectively, important analogies are suggested. The basic point is the
coincidence of the initial and final state many-body wave-functions in the two
types of processes and the formal similarity of the transition operators. First
experimental results obtained at the INFN-LNS laboratory for the
40Ca(18O,18Ne)40Ar reaction at 270 MeV, give encouraging indication on the
capability of the proposed technique to access relevant quantitative
information. The two major aspects for this project are the K800
Superconducting Cyclotron and MAGNEX spectrometer. The former is used for the
acceleration of the required high resolution and low emittance heavy ion beams
and the latter is the large acceptance magnetic spectrometer for the detection
of the ejectiles. The use of the high-order trajectory reconstruction
technique, implemented in MAGNEX, allows to reach the experimental resolution
and sensitivity required for the accurate measurement of the DCE cross sections
at forward angles. However, the tiny values of such cross sections and the
resolution requirements demand beam intensities much larger than manageable
with the present facility. The on-going upgrade of the INFN-LNS facilities in
this perspective is part of the NUMEN project and will be discussed in the

Recent work in DGA detection leveraged deep learning architectures like
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and character-level long short-term memory
networks (LSTMs) to classify domains. However, these classifiers perform poorly
with wordlist-based DGA families, which generate domains by pseudorandomly
concatenating dictionary words. We propose a novel approach that combines
context-sensitive word embeddings with a simple fully-connected classifier to
perform classification of domains based on word-level information. The word
embeddings were pre-trained on a large unrelated corpus and left frozen during
the training on domain data. The resulting small number of trainable parameters
enabled extremely short training durations, while the transfer of language
knowledge stored in the representations allowed for high-performing models with
small training datasets. We show that this architecture reliably outperformed
existing techniques on wordlist-based DGA families with just 30 DGA training
examples and achieved state-of-the-art performance with around 100 DGA training
examples, all while requiring an order of magnitude less time to train compared
to current techniques. Of special note is the technique's performance on the
matsnu DGA: the classifier attained a 89.5% detection rate with a 1:1,000 false
positive rate (FPR) after training on only 30 examples of the DGA domains, and
a 91.2% detection rate with a 1:10,000 FPR after 90 examples. Considering that
some of these DGAs have wordlists of several hundred words, our results
demonstrate that this technique does not rely on the classifier learning the
DGA wordlists. Instead, the classifier is able to learn the semantic signatures
of the wordlist-based DGA families.

locations are given by a renewal process on the line, motions are ballistic -
i.e. each particle is assigned an i.i.d. constant velocity - and collisions
between pairs of particles result in mutual annihilation.
  We focus on the case when the velocities are symmetrically distributed among
three values, i.e. particles either remain static (with given probability~$p$)
or move at constant velocity uniformly chosen among $\pm1$. We establish that
this model goes through a phase transition at $p_c=1/4$ between a subcritical
regime where every particle eventually annihilates, and a supercritical regime
where a positive density of static particles is never hit, confirming 1990s
predictions of Droz et al. for the particular case of a Poisson process. Our
result encompasses cases where triple collisions can happen; these are resolved
by annihilation of one static and one randomly chosen moving particle.
  Our arguments, of combinatorial nature, show that, although the model is not
completely solvable, certain large scale features can be explicitly computed,
and are universal, i.e. insensitive to the distribution of the initial point
process. In particular, in the critical and subcritical regimes, the
asymptotics of the time decay of the densities of each type of particle is
universal (among exponentially integrable interdistance distributions) and, in
the supercritical regime, the distribution of the ``skyline'' process, i.e. the
process restricted to the last particles to ever visit a location, has a

distribution of 56Ni out to different fractions of the envelope and ""boxcar""

duration of the plateau. We find a formula to estimate the extension based on
the observed bolometric light curves and show that for most SNe IIP 56Ni
extends the plateau by about 20%. Another effect of 56Ni consists in reduction
of the plateau decline rate, i.e. 56Ni presented in the ejecta flattens the
plateau. Our simulations suggest that for typical SNe IIP it can reduce the
decline rate by about 1 mag/100 day. We find that for the contribution of 56Ni
seen in most SNe our simulated bolometric light curves resemble observed ones
for various types of 56Ni mixing. We thereby cannot determine the level of 56Ni
mixing in these SNe based on the light curve alone. However, for SN2009ib we

decay of the variation of the direct state at scale 1 as $|x|\rightarrow
\infty$. In order to apply the method in a bi-directional topology optimization

ferromagnetic material and the sensitivity for introducing material inside an

introduce a way to efficiently evaluate the obtained formulas. Finally, we
employ the derived formulas in a level-set based topology optimization

unstructured scenarios. However, this is a challenging undertaking,
particularly in terms of perception and planning. Unstructured scenarios are
full of objects with different shapes and appearances that have to be grasped
in a very specific manner so they can be functionally used. In this paper we
present an integrated approach to perform dual-arm pick tasks autonomously. Our
method consists of semantic segmentation, object pose estimation, deformable
model registration, grasp planning and arm trajectory optimization. The entire
pipeline can be executed on-board and is suitable for on-line grasping
scenarios. For this, our approach makes use of accumulated knowledge expressed
as convolutional neural network models and low-dimensional latent shape spaces.
For manipulating objects, we propose a stochastic trajectory optimization that
includes a kinematic chain closure constraint. Evaluation in simulation and on
the real robot corroborates the feasibility and applicability of the proposed
methods on a task of picking up unknown watering cans and drills using both
arms.

from microbial communities to human societies. It, however, seemingly
contradicts the evolutionary theory, since cooperators are exploited by
free-riders and thus are disfavored by natural selection. Many studies based on
evolutionary game theory have tried to solve the puzzle and figure out the
reason why cooperation exists and how it emerges. Network reciprocity is one of
the mechanisms to promote cooperation, where nodes refer to individuals and
links refer to social relationships. The spatial arrangement of mutant
individuals, which refers to the clustering of mutants, plays a key role in
network reciprocity. Besides, many other mechanisms supporting cooperation
suggest that the clustering of mutants plays an important role in the expansion
of mutants. However, the clustering of mutants and the game dynamics are
typically coupled. It is still unclear how the clustering of mutants alone
alters the evolutionary dynamics. To this end, we employ a minimal model with
frequency independent fitness on a circle. It disentangles the clustering of
mutants from game dynamics. The distance between two mutants on the circle is
adopted as a natural indicator for the clustering of mutants or assortment. We
find that the assortment is an amplifier of the selection for the connected
mutants compared with the separated ones. Nevertheless, as mutants are
separated, the more dispersed mutants are, the greater the chance of invasion
is. It gives rise to the non-monotonic effect of clustering, which is
counterintuitive. On the other hand, we find that less assortative mutants
speed up fixation. Our model shows that the clustering of mutants plays a
non-trivial role in fixation, which has emerged even if the game interaction is
absent.

density-functional theory calculations [Phys. Rev. B 95, 054118 (2017)]. We
revisit this polymorph using both ab-initio and classical molecular dynamics
simulations. The structure undergoes a phase transition to a superionic phase
in which calcium ions lie on a bcc-symmetry lattice (space group Im-3m), a
phase not previously discussed for the group-II difluorides. We demonstrate
that modelling this phase transition is surprisingly difficult, and requires
very large simulation cells (at least 864 atoms) in order to observe correct
qualitative and quantitative behaviour. The prediction of superionic behaviour
in P-62m-CaF2 was originally made through the observation of a lattice
instability at the harmonic level in DFT calculations. Using superionic
alpha-CaF2, CeO2, beta-PbF2 and Li2O as examples, we examine the potential of
using phonons as a means to search for superionic materials, and propose that
this offers an affordable way to do so.

combination with a superconducting Pb contact is used to extract the local

different transport regimes. In the cases where the energy distribution
function resembles a Fermi-Dirac distribution, the local electron temperature
can directly be accessed. This allows us to study the cooling mechanisms of hot
electrons in graphene. In the case of long samples (device length $L$ much
larger than the electron-phonon scattering length $l_{e-ph}$), cooling through
acoustic phonons is dominant. We find a cross-over from the dirty limit with a
power law $~T^3$ at low temperature to the clean limit at higher temperatures
with a power law $~T^4$ and a deformation potential of 13.3 eV. For shorter
samples, where $L$ is smaller than $l_{e-ph}$ but larger than the
electron-electron scattering length $l_{e-e}$, the well-known cooling through
electron out-diffusion is found. Interestingly, we find strong indications of
an enhanced Lorenz number in graphene. We also find evidence of a
non-Fermi-Dirac distribution function, which is a result of non-interacting

and voltage security limits is a challenging task for large-scale power systems
in the presence of real-time variations caused by the uncertain demand and the
fluctuating power output of renewable energy sources (RESs). The proposed
formulation in this work supports joint scheduling of energy and reserve to
promote an economic and reliable operation. To improve its scalability, a
two-stage iterative optimization algorithm is proposed based on Bender's
decomposition framework. Therewith, the optimal schedule is computed subject to
the feasibility of AC network constraints (AC-NCs) at predetermined uncertain
realizations. A convex relaxation is applied to AC-NCs to support the
convergence of the algorithm. Moreover, the integration of RESs is often
limited by transmission congestion issues in existing grids. For such grids, AC
to DC conversion schemes can be viable and attractive options for capacity
expansion. In this study, we adopt a hybrid AC/DC transmission grid (HTG)
architecture with a specific topology to improve the effective utilization of
the grid capacity and accommodate more demand and RESs, which is showcased via

focus from conventional hand-crafted symbolic representations to dense inputs,
which are adequate representations learned automatically from corpora. However,
particularly when working with low-resource languages, small amounts of
symbolic lexical resources such as user-generated lexicons are often available
even when gold-standard corpora are not. Such additional linguistic information
is though often neglected, and recent neural approaches to cross-lingual
tagging typically rely only on word and subword embeddings. While these
representations are effective, our recent work has shown clear benefits of
combining the best of both worlds: integrating conventional lexical information
improves neural cross-lingual part-of-speech (PoS) tagging. However, little is
known on how complementary such additional information is, and to what extent
improvements depend on the coverage and quality of these external resources.
This paper seeks to fill this gap by providing the first thorough analysis on
the contributions of lexical resources for cross-lingual PoS tagging in neural

the $G$-functions $F_n^{[s]}(z)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{A_k}{(k+n)^s}z^k$ for
every integers $s\ge 0$ and $n\ge 1$. These functions can be analytically
continued to a domain $\mathcal{D}_F$ star-shaped at $0$ and containing the
disk $\{\vert z\vert <R\}$. Fix any $\alpha \in\mathcal D_F \cap
\overline{\mathbb{Q}}^*$, not a singularity of $L_F$, and any number field
$\mathbb{K}$ containing $\alpha$ and the $A_k$'s. Let $\Phi_{\alpha, S}$ be the
$\mathbb{K}$-vector space spanned by the values $F_n^{[s]}(\alpha)$, $n\ge 1$

$\vert \alpha\vert <R$. Its proof relies on an explicit construction of a
Pad\'e approximation problem adapted to certain non-holomorphic functions
associated to $F$, and it is quite different of that in the above mentioned
paper. It makes use of results of Andr\'e, Chudnovsky and Katz on
$G$-operators, of a linear independence criterion \`a la Siegel over number

the approach of Bertrand-Beukers and Bertrand.

Rather than fixing the network at training time, we train a ""Dynamic-Net"" that

Hyades stars, and homogeneously analysed them. After cleaning the sample from
binaries, RV variables, and outliers, 71 stars remained. The distribution of
the observed RV difference (spectroscopic -- astrometric) is skewed and depends
on the star right ascension. This is consistent with the Hyades cluster
rotating at 42.3 +/- 10 m/s/pc. The two Hyades giants in the sample show, as
predicted by gravitational redshift (GR), a spectroscopic RV that is
blue-shifted with respect to the dwarfs, and the empirical GR slope is of 626
+/- 131 m/s, in agreement with the theoretical prediction. The difference
between spectroscopic and astrometric RVs is very close to zero, within the
uncertainties. In particular, the mean difference is of -33 m/s and the median
is of -16 m/s when considering the Gaia-based RVs (corrected for cluster
rotation), with a sigma of 347 m/s, very close to the expected cluster velocity
dispersion. We also determine a new value of the cluster centroid spectroscopic
RV: 39.36 +/- 0.26 km/s. The spectroscopic RV measurements are expected, from
simulations, to depend on stellar rotation, but our data do not confirm these
predictions. We finally discuss other phenomena that can influence the RV
difference, such as cluster expansion, stellar activity, general relativity,

are measured in a fiducial volume with the ATLAS detector at a centre-of-mass
energy of 13 TeV. Results are presented using proton-proton collision data
collected by the LHC during 2015 and 2016, amounting to a total of 36.1
fb$^{-1}$. This also presents the first $t\bar{t}\gamma$ cross-section
measurements performed in the dilepton channels. Exactly one photon is required
to have $p_{\text{T}} > 20$ GeV and be isolated based on track and calorimeter
information. At least two (four) jets are required in the dilepton
(single-lepton) channels, with at least one jet originating from a $b$-quark.
Two separate neural network algorithms are used to help reduce the impact
backgrounds play in the final measurements. The Prompt Photon Tagger is trained
on information from energy deposits in the calorimeters to distinguish prompt
photons from hadronic fake photons. The output of this neural network is fed
into the Event-level Discriminator that uses event information to classify
signal from the sum of all backgrounds. A maximum likelihood fit is performed
on the output of the Event-level Discriminator to determine the fiducial cross
section of the signal process. The fiducial cross section for the single-lepton
and dilepton channel are measured to be $521 \pm 9 \text{(stat.)} \pm 41
\text{(sys.)}$ fb and $69 \pm 3 \text{(stat.)} \pm 4\text{(sys.)}$ fb,
respectively. In total, eight cross-section measurements are performed and all
agree with theoretical next-to-leading-order predictions.

parameters of the superconducting state in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_{x}$BiO$_{3}$ (BKBO) is
studied at $x \in (0.3, 0.4, 0.5)$. This is done by employing the adiabatic and
non-adiabatic Eliashberg equations in context of the available experimental
data. It is found that the retardation, strong-coupling and the non-adiabatic
effects notably influence superconducting phase in BKBO. In particular, the
electron-electron interaction, approximated here by the Coulomb
pseudopotential, is argued to be reduced by the non-adiabatic effects that
supplement retardation and allow for the phonon-mediated superconductivity.
These findings are reinforced by further analysis of the isotope effect showing
reduction of the isotope coefficient with respect to the canonical
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) level, as caused by the interplay of all
effects mentioned above. Although physics behind the isotope effect appears to
be complex, its resulting behavior comply with the scenario for the
conventional superconductors. In summary, obtained results confirm recent
theoretical and experimental studies that suggest phonon-mediated mechanism of
superconductivity in BKBO. However, they also point out that this phase cannot
be properly described with the BCS theory due to the existence of somewhat
unusual effects.

Probability distributions play a highly important role in many applications.
Improving the quality of distribution estimations made using incomplete samples
is highly important. Missing samples can be compensated for by applying
conventional missing data restoration methods; however, ensuring that restored
samples roughly follow underlying distributions of true missing data remains a
challenge. Another strategy involves directly restoring the probability density
function (PDF) for a sensor when samples are missing by leveraging distribution
information from another sensor with complete data using distribution
regression techniques; existing methods include the conventional
distribution-to-distribution regression (DDR) and distribution-to-warping
function regression (DWR) methods. Due to constraints on PDFs and warping
functions, the regression functions of both methods are estimated from the
Nadaraya-Watson kernel estimator with relatively low degrees of precision. This
article proposes a new indirect distribution-to-distribution regression method
in the context of functional data analysis for restoring distributions of
missing SHM data. PDFs are transformed to ordinary functions residing in a
Hilbert space via the newly proposed log-quantile-density (LQD) transformation;
the regression for distributions is realized in the transformed space via a
functional regression model constructed based on the theory of Reproducing
Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), corresponding result is subsequently mapped back
to the density space through the inverse LQD transformation. Test results using
field monitoring data indicate that the new method significantly outperforms
conventional methods in general cases; however, in extrapolation cases, the new
method is inferior to the distribution-to-warping function regression method.

layer edges differently. In this paper, we propose a method called MGCN that
utilizes the GCN for multi-layer graphs. MGCN embeds nodes of multi-layer
graphs using both within and between layers relations and nodes attributes. We
evaluate our method on the semi-supervised node classification task.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to
other multi-layer and single-layer competitors and also show the positive
effect of using cross-layer edges.

effect of material distribution (i.e., microstructure) on material performance.
The challenge is to synthesize microstructures, given a finite number of
microstructure images, and/or some physical invariances that the microstructure
exhibits. Conventional approaches are based on stochastic optimization and are
computationally intensive. We introduce three generative models for the fast
synthesis of binary microstructure images. The first model is a WGAN model that
uses a finite number of training images to synthesize new microstructures that
weakly satisfy the physical invariances respected by the original data. The
second model explicitly enforces known physical invariances by replacing the
traditional discriminator in a GAN with an invariance checker. Our third model
combines the first two models to reconstruct microstructures that respect both
explicit physics invariances as well as implicit constraints learned from the
image data. We illustrate these models by reconstructing two-phase
microstructures that exhibit coarsening behavior. The trained models also
exhibit interesting latent variable interpolation behavior, and the results
indicate considerable promise for enforcing user-defined physics constraints
during microstructure synthesis.

a multi-level and multi-scale manner. In this context, high-level layers may
considered as groups of variables interacting in lower-level layers. This is
particularly true in biology, where, for example, genes are grouped in pathways
and two types of interactions are present: pathway-pathway interactions and
gene-gene interactions. However, from data it is only possible to measure the
expression of genes while it is impossible to directly measure the activity of
pathways. Nevertheless, the knowledge on the inter-dependence between the
groups and the variables allows for a multi-layer network inference, on both
observed variables and groups, even if no direct information on the latter is
present in the data (hence groups are considered as latent). In this paper, we
propose an extension of the latent graphical lasso method that leverages on the
knowledge of the inter-links between the hidden (groups) and observed layers.
The method exploits the knowledge of group structure that influence the
behaviour of observed variables to retrieve a two layers network. Its efficacy
was tested on synthetic data to check its ability in retrieving the network
structure compared to the ground truth. We present a case study on
Neuroblastoma, which shows how our multi-level inference is relevant in real
contexts to infer biologically meaningful connections.

for stereo to cancel the effects of bubbles and/or water fluctuation. Since it
is not easy to train CNN with small size of database with large variation, we
develop a special bubble generation device to efficiently create real bubble

Traditional ASR systems rely on multidimensional acoustic features such as the
Mel filter bank energies alongside with the first, and second order derivatives
to characterize time-frames that compose the signal sequence. Considering that
these components describe three different views of the same element, neural
networks have to learn both the internal relations that exist within these

important interest from researchers to process and learn such relations in
multidimensional spaces. Indeed, quaternion numbers and QNNs have shown their
efficiency to process multidimensional inputs as entities, to encode internal

candidate for Fifth Generation (5G) wireless communication system. However,
C-RAN imposes stringent requirements on fronthaul in terms of capacity which in
turn becomes a bottleneck for deployment of cloud-RAN in dense networks.
Compressed CPRI and functional split are two primary solutions to overcome
this. However, this makes Remote Radio Unit (RRU) more complex and the
computational resources in RRU are localized and thus cannot be shared with
other RRUs when not in use. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Variable
Rate Fronthaul (VRF) for C-RAN. This scheme operates on a CPRI type of
interface (e.g., one that transmits I/Q data samples) with the novelty of
dynamically changing the cell bandwidth, and consequently the fronthaul data
rates, depending on the cell load, with the support of a Software Defined
Network (SDN) controller. This allows for a more efficient transport of C-RAN
cells data over a shared backhaul. We first propose a mathematical analysis of
the VRF performance using a queuing theory approach based on the Markov model.
We then provide the results of our simulation framework both for validation and
in support of the mathematical analysis. Our results show that the proposed VRF
scheme provides significantly lower blocking probability over a shared backhaul

construct flexible and interpretable prediction models. However, an
interpretability evaluation, a relationship between generalization performance
and an interpretability of the model and a method for improving the
interpretability have to be considered. In this paper, a quantitative index of
the interpretability is proposed and its rationality is proved, and equilibrium
problem between the interpretability and the generalization performance is
analyzed. Probability upper bound of the sum of the two performances is
analyzed. For traditional supervised kernel machine learning problem, a
universal learning framework is put forward to solve the equilibrium problem
between the two performances. The condition for global optimal solution based
on the framework is deduced. The learning framework is applied to the
least-squares support vector machine and is evaluated by some experiments.

access (NOMA) techniques for each subcarrier. For this setup, we formulate a
joint resource allocation problem where a new set of access technology
selection parameters along with power and subcarrier are allocated for each
user based on each user's channel state information. Here, we define a novel
utility function taking into account the rate and costs of access technologies.
This cost reflects both the complexity of performing successive interference
cancellation and the complexity incurred to guarantee a desired bit error rate.
This utility function can inherently demonstrate the trade-off between OMA and
NOMA. Due to non-convexity of our proposed resource allocation problem, we
resort to successive convex approximation where a two-step iterative algorithm
is applied in which a problem of the first step, called access technology
selection, is transformed into a linear integer programming problem, and the
nonconvex problem of the second step, referred to power allocation problem, is
solved via the difference-of-convex-functions (DC) programming. Moreover, the
closed-form solution for power allocation in the second step is derived. For
diverse network performance criteria such as rate, simulation results show that
the proposed new dynamic access technology selection outperforms
single-technology OMA or NOMA multiple access solutions.
