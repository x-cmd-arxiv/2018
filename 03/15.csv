They are strictly more expressive than static fault trees, but this comes at a
price: their interpretation is non-trivial and leaves quite some freedom. This
paper presents a GSPN semantics for DFTs. This semantics is rather simple and
compositional. The key feature is that this GSPN semantics unifies all existing
DFT semantics from the literature. All semantic variants can be obtained by
choosing appropriate priorities and treatment of non-determinism.

populations, many members of which perish, and a few survive. While it is
recognized that thymic cells are 'audited' to optimize an organism's immune
repertoire, whether gametogenesis could be orchestrated similarly to favour
high quality gametes is uncertain. Ideally, such quality would be affirmed at
early stages before the commitment of extensive parental resources. A case is
here made that, along the lines of a previously proposed lymphocyte quality
control mechanism, gamete quality can be registered indirectly through
detection of incompatibilities between proteins encoded by the grandparental
DNA sequences within the parent from which haploid gametes are meiotically
derived. This 'stress test' is achieved in the same way that thymic screening
for potential immunological incompatibilities is achieved - by 'promiscuous'
expression, under the influence of the AIRE protein, of the products of genes
that are not normally specific for that organ. Consistent with this, the Aire
gene is expressed in both thymus and gonads, and AIRE deficiency impedes
function in both organs. While not excluding the subsequent emergence of hybrid
incompatibilities due to the intermixing of genomic sequences from parents
(rather than grandparents), many observations, such as the number of proteins
that are aberrantly expressed during gametogenesis, can be explained on this
basis. Indeed, promiscuous expression could have first evolved in
gamete-forming cells where incompatible proteins would be manifest as aberrant
protein aggregates that cause apoptosis. This mechanism would later have been
co-opted by thymic epithelial cells which display peptides from aggregates to
remove potentially autoreactive T cells.

(LSI) and weak hypercontractivity (HC), introduced in the quantum setting by
Olkiewicz and Zegarlinski, to the case of non-primitive quantum Markov
semigroups (QMS). The originality of this work resides in that this new notion
of hypercontractivity is given in terms of the so-called amalgamated
$\mathbb{L}_p$ norms introduced recently by Junge and Parcet in the context of
operator spaces theory. We make three main contributions. The first one is a
version of Gross' integration lemma: we prove that (weak) HC implies (weak)
LSI. Surprisingly, the converse implication differs from the primitive case as
we show that LSI implies HC but with a weak constant equal to the cardinal of
the center of the decoherence-free algebra. Building on the first implication,
our second contribution is the fact that strong LSI and therefore strong HC do
not hold for non-trivially primitive QMS. This implies that the amalgamated
$\mathbb{L}_p$ norms are not uniformly convex for $1\leq p \leq 2$. As a third
contribution, we derive universal bounds on the (weak) logarithmic Sobolev
constants for a QMS on a finite dimensional Hilbert space, using a similar
method as Diaconis and Saloff-Coste in the case of classical primitive Markov
chains, and Temme, Pastawski and Kastoryano in the case of primitive QMS. This
leads to new bounds on the decoherence rates of decohering QMS. Additionally,
we apply our results to the study of the tensorization of HC in non-commutative
spaces in terms of the completely bounded norms (CB norms) recently introduced
by Beigi and King for unital and trace preserving QMS. We generalize their
results to the case of a general primitive QMS and provide estimates on the
(weak) constants.

developed a deep learning framework for dynamic STEM imaging that is trained to

apply it for mapping solid state reactions and transformations in layered WS2

from raw STEM data (single images and movies) in a matter of seconds, which are
then classified into different categories using unsupervised clustering
methods. We further expanded our framework to extract parameters of diffusion
for the sulfur vacancies and analyzed transition probabilities associated with
switching between different configurations of defect complexes consisting of Mo
dopant and sulfur vacancy, providing insight into point defect dynamics and
reactions. This approach is universal and its application to beam induced
reactions allows mapping chemical transformation pathways in solids at the
atomic level.

practice, particularly from a regulatory viewpoint, is controlling the type I
error rate. In particular, we show that the naive z-test can have an inflated
type I error rate even after applying a Bonferroni correction. Simulation
studies have often been used to demonstrate error control, but do not provide a
guarantee. In this paper, we present adaptive testing procedures for normally
distributed outcomes that ensure strong familywise error control, by
iteratively applying the conditional invariance principle. Our approach can be
used for fully sequential and block randomized trials, and for a large class of
adaptive randomization rules found in the literature. We show there is a high
price to pay in terms of power to guarantee familywise error control for
randomization schemes with extreme allocation probabilities. However, for
proposed Bayesian adaptive randomization schemes in the literature, our
adaptive tests maintain or increase the power of the trial compared to the
z-test. We illustrate our method using a three-armed trial in primary
hypercholesterolemia.

repeat-pass geometry. InSAR technique is used to estimate the topographic

focusing technique is the nature of the two-dimensional SAR result, affected by
the layover indetermination. In order to resolve this problem, a minimum of two
sensor acquisitions, separated by a baseline and extended in the
cross-slant-range, are needed. However, given its multi-temporal nature, these
techniques are vulnerable to atmosphere and Earth environment parameters
variation in addition to physical platform instabilities. Furthermore, either
two radars are needed or an interferometric cycle is required (that spans from
days to weeks), which makes real time DEM estimation impossible. In this work,
the authors propose a novel experimental alternative to the InSAR method that
uses single-pass acquisitions, using a data driven approach implemented by Deep
Neural Networks. We propose a fully Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Encoder-Decoder architecture, training it on radar images in order to estimate
DEMs from single pass image acquisitions. Our results on a set of Sentinel
images show that this method is able to learn to some extent the statistical
properties of the DEM. The results of this exploratory analysis are encouraging

particularly appealing to hardware implementations since they can be

Also it is important to understand the relative pros and cons of SCNNs and BNNs

concerns, in this paper we prove that the ""ideal"" SCNNs and BNNs satisfy the
universal approximation property with probability 1 (due to the stochastic
behavior). The proof is conducted by first proving the property for SCNNs from
the strong law of large numbers, and then using SCNNs as a ""bridge"" to prove
for BNNs. Based on the universal approximation property, we further prove that
SCNNs and BNNs exhibit the same energy complexity. In other words, they have
the same asymptotic energy consumption with the growing of network size. We
also provide a detailed analysis of the pros and cons of SCNNs and BNNs for
hardware implementations and conclude that SCNNs are more suitable for
hardware.

players. The amount of memory required to represent these games is the main
bottleneck of algorithms for computing optimal strategies and the size of these
strategies is often impractical for real-world applications. A common approach
to tackle the memory bottleneck is to use information abstraction that removes
parts of information available to players thus reducing the number of decision
points in the game. However, existing information-abstraction techniques are
either specific for a particular domain, they do not provide any quality
guarantees, or they are applicable to very small subclasses of EFGs. We present
domain-independent abstraction methods for creating imperfect recall
abstractions in extensive-form games that allow computing strategies that are
(near) optimal in the original game. To this end, we introduce two novel
algorithms, FPIRA and CFR+IRA, based on fictitious play and counterfactual
regret minimization. These algorithms can start with an arbitrary domain
specific, or the coarsest possible, abstraction of the original game. The
algorithms iteratively detect the missing information they require for
computing a strategy for the abstract game that is (near) optimal in the
original game. This information is then included back into the abstract game.
Moreover, our algorithms are able to exploit imperfect-recall abstractions that
allow players to forget even history of their own actions. However, the
algorithms require traversing the complete unabstracted game tree. We
experimentally show that our algorithms can closely approximate Nash
equilibrium of large games using abstraction with as little as 0.9% of
information sets of the original game. Moreover, the results suggest that
memory savings increase with the increasing size of the original games.

is ""encoded"" to have an over-complete representation with built-in redundancy,
and the straggling nodes in the system are dynamically left out of the
computation at every iteration, whose loss is compensated by the embedded
redundancy. We show that oblivious application of several popular optimization
algorithms on encoded data, including gradient descent, L-BFGS, proximal
gradient under data parallelism, and coordinate descent under model
parallelism, converge to either approximate or exact solutions of the original
problem when stragglers are treated as erasures. These convergence results are
deterministic, i.e., they establish sample path convergence for arbitrary
sequences of delay patterns or distributions on the nodes, and are independent
of the tail behavior of the delay distribution. We demonstrate that equiangular
tight frames have desirable properties as encoding matrices, and propose
efficient mechanisms for encoding large-scale data. We implement the proposed
technique on Amazon EC2 clusters, and demonstrate its performance over several
learning problems, including matrix factorization, LASSO, ridge regression and
logistic regression, and compare the proposed method with uncoded,
asynchronous, and data replication strategies.

the Gross-Pitaevskii energy functional and that the many-body ground state
fully condensates on the Gross-Pitaevskii minimizers. In the mean-field regime,
when the interaction length scale is $O(1)$, we are able to verify Bogoliubov's
approximation and obtain the second order expansion of the ground state energy.
While such asymptotic results have several precursors in the literature on
one-component condensates, the adaption to the multi-component setting is
non-trivial in various respects and the analysis will be presented in details.

and temporal correlations, both providing information of emitter locations. The
majority of localization algorithms in the literature estimate emitter
locations by frame-by-frame localization (FFL), which exploit only the spatial
correlation and leave the temporal correlation into the FFL nanoscopy images.
The temporal correlation contained in the FFL images, if exploited, can improve
the localization accuracy and the image quality. In this paper, we analyze the
properties of the FFL images in terms of root mean square minimum distance
(RMSMD) and root mean square error (RMSE). It is shown that RMSMD and RMSE can
be potentially reduced by a maximum fold equal to the square root of the
average number of activations per emitter. Analyzed and revealed are also
several statistical properties of RMSMD and RMSE and their relationship with
respect to a large number of data frames, bias and variance of localization
errors, small localization errors, sample drift, and the worst FFL image.
Numerical examples are taken and the results confirm the prediction of
analysis. The ideas about how to develop an algorithm to exploit the temporal
correlation of FFL images are also briefly discussed. The results suggest
development of two kinds of localization algorithms: the algorithms that can
exploit the temporal correlation of FFL images and the unbiased localization
algorithms.

is to evaluate the combined effects of dark matter physics and stellar feedback
on the well-known small-scale issues found in cold dark matter (CDM) models. We
find that the $z=0$ stellar mass of a galaxy is strongly correlated with the
central density of its host dark matter halo at the time of formation, $z_{\rm
f}$, in both CDM and WDM models. WDM halos follow the same
$M_{\star}(z=0)-V_{\rm max}(z_{\rm f})$ relation as in CDM, but they form
later, are less centrally dense, and therefore contain galaxies that are less
massive than their CDM counterparts. As a result, the impact of baryonic
effects on the central gravitational potential is typically diminished relative
to CDM. However, the combination of delayed formation in WDM and energy input
from stellar feedback results in dark matter profiles with lower overall
densities. The WDM galaxies studied here have a wider diversity of star
formation histories (SFHs) than the same systems simulated in CDM, and the two
lowest $M_{\star}$ WDM galaxies form all of their stars at late times. The
discovery of young ultra-faint dwarf galaxies with no ancient star formation --
which do not exist in our CDM simulations -- would therefore provide evidence
in support of WDM.

present results of two-dimensional two fluid (gas + dust) hydrodynamic

order to fit the high gas-to-dust ratio of the first gap, we find the
Shakura--Sunyaev viscosity parameter $\alpha$ must be very small ($\lesssim
10^{-4}$) in the inner disk. On the other hand, a relatively large $\alpha$
($\sim 7.5\times 10^{-3}$) is required to reproduce the dust surface density in
the outer disk. We interpret the variation of $\alpha$ as an indicator of the
transition from an inner dead zone to the outer magnetorotational instability
(MRI) active zone. Within $\sim 100$ au, the HD 163296 disk's ionization level
is low, and non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects could suppress the MRI,
so the disk can be largely laminar. The disk's ionization level gradually
increases toward larger radii, and the outermost disk ($r > 300$ au) becomes
turbulent due to MRI. Under this condition, we find that the observed dust

achieve non-commutativity of the two limits even for a system that is

gravity and compressible hydrodynamics. While this micro-scale chaos and
stochasticity has been well studied, it is poorly understood how it couples to
macro-scale properties examined in simulations of galaxy formation. In this
paper, we show how perturbations introduced by floating-point roundoff, random
number generators, and seemingly trivial differences in algorithmic behaviour
can produce non-trivial differences in star formation histories, circumgalactic
medium (CGM) properties, and the distribution of stellar mass. We examine the
importance of stochasticity due to discreteness noise, variations in merger
timings and how self-regulation moderates the effects of this stochasticity. We
show that chaotic variations in stellar mass can grow until halted by
feedback-driven self-regulation or gas exhaustion. We also find that galaxy
mergers are critical points from which large (as much as a factor of 2)
variations in quantities such as the galaxy stellar mass can grow. These
variations can grow and persist for more than a Gyr before regressing towards
the mean. These results show that detailed comparisons of simulations require
serious consideration of the magnitude of effects compared to run-to-run
chaotic variation, and may significantly complicate interpreting the impact of
different physical models. Understanding the results of simulations requires us
to understand that the process of simulation is not a mapping of an
infinitesimal point in configuration space to another, final infinitesimal
point. Instead, simulations map a point in a space of possible initial
conditions points to a volume of possible final states.

particles reside beyond half the halo virial radius (>~100 kpc). In order to
constrain the nature of the gas traced by OVI, we analyze additional
observables of the outer halo, namely HI to OVI column ratios of 1-10, an
absence of low-ion absorption, a mean differential extinction of E(B-V)~10^-3,
and a linear relation between OVI column and velocity width. We contrast these
observations with two physical scenarios: (1) OVI traces high-pressure (~30
cm^-3 K) collisionally-ionized gas cooling from a virially-shocked phase, and
(2) OVI traces low-pressure (<~1 cm^-3 K) gas beyond the accretion shock, where
the gas is in ionization and thermal equilibrium with the UV background. We
demonstrate that the high-pressure scenario requires multiple gas phases to
explain the observations, and a large deposition of energy at >~100 kpc to
offset the energy radiated by the cooling gas. In contrast, the low-pressure
scenario can explain all considered observations with a single gas phase in
thermal equilibrium, provided that the baryon overdensity is comparable to the
dark-matter overdensity, and that the gas is enriched to >~Z_sun/3 with an
ISM-like dust-to-metal ratio. The low-pressure scenario implies that OVI traces
a cool flow with mass flow rate of ~5 M_sun yr^-1, comparable to the star
formation rate of the central galaxies. The OVI line widths are consistent with
the velocity shear expected within this flow. The low-pressure scenario
predicts a bimodality in absorption line ratios at ~100 kpc, due to the
pressure jump across the accretion shock.

galaxies with TFs have higher stellar and halo masses, $\sim 3\times$ closer
distances to nearest neighbors (in the same group), and possibly fewer group
members at fixed halo mass than galaxies without TFs, but similar specific star
formation rates. These results suggest TFs in gas-poor galaxies are typically
streams/shells from dry mergers or satellite disruption. In contrast, the
presence of TFs around gas-rich galaxies does not correlate with stellar or
halo mass, suggesting these TFs are often tails/arms from resonant
interactions. Similar to TFs in gas-poor galaxies, TFs in gas-rich galaxies
imply 1.7x closer nearest neighbors in the same group; however, TFs in gas-rich
galaxies are associated with diskier morphologies, higher star formation rates,
and higher gas content. In addition to interactions with known neighbors, we
suggest that TFs in gas-rich galaxies may arise from accretion of cosmic gas

well fitted to a sinusoid of an observed period of $\approx 1,884$ days and
well modeled by the relativistic Doppler boosting of the secondary mini-disk

52700$ to MJD $\approx 56400$ covers only $\sim 2$ cycles of periodic

stochastic quasar variability (Vaughan et al. 2016). In this Letter, we present
a re-analysis of PG1302, using the latest light curve from the All-Sky

baseline to the present day (MJD $\approx 58200$), and adopting a maximum
likelihood method which searches for a periodic component in addition to
stochastic quasar variability. When the ASAS-SN data are combined with the
previous LINEAR+CRTS data, the evidence for periodicity decreases. For genuine
periodicity one would expect that additional data would strengthen the
evidence, so the decrease in significance may be an indication that the binary

two different high-redshift data sets, provided by the evolving Ultra-Violet

surface of weakly magnetised accreting star is required in order to explain the
observed accretion timescales in low-mass X-ray binaries, cataclysmic variables
or young stars with massive protoplanetary discs. Accretion disc boundary layer
is locally represented by incompressible homogeneous and boundless flow of the
cyclonic type, which is linearly stable. Its non-linear instability at the
shear rates of order of the rotational frequency remains an issue. We argue
that hydrodynamical subcritical turbulence in such a flow is sustained by the
non-linear feedback from essentially three-dimensional vortices, which are
generated by quasi-two-dimensional trailing shearing spirals grown to high
amplitude via the swing amplification. We refer to those three-dimensional
vortices as cross-rolls, since they are aligned in the shearwise direction in
contrast to streamwise rolls generated by the anti-lift-up mechanism in
rotating shear flow on the Rayleigh line. Transient growth of cross-rolls is
studied analytically and further confronted with direct numerical simulations
(DNS) of dynamics of non-linear erturbations. DNS performed in a tall box show
that transition Reynolds number $R_T$ as function of shear rate accords with
the line of constant maximum transient growth of cross-rolls. The transition in
the tall box has been observed until the shear rate three times higher than the
rotational frequency, when $R_T\sim 50000$. Assuming that the cross-rolls are
also responsible for turbulence in the Keplerian flow, we estimate $R_T\lesssim
10^8$ in this case. The most favourable shear rate to test the existence of
turbulence in the quasi-Keplerian regime may be sub-Keplerian and equal
approximately to $1/2$.

real-valued matrix and tensor factorizations to data where values are integers.
Such data are common when the values correspond to event counts or ordinal
measures. The conventional approach is to treat integer data as real, and then
apply real-valued factorizations. However, doing so fails to preserve important
characteristics of the original data, thereby making it hard to interpret the
results. Instead, our approach extracts factor values from integer datasets as
scores that are constrained to take values from a small integer set. These
scores are easy to interpret: a score of zero indicates no feature contribution
and higher scores indicate distinct levels of feature importance.
  At its core, SUSTain relies on: a) a problem partitioning into
integer-constrained subproblems, so that they can be optimally solved in an
efficient manner; and b) organizing the order of the subproblems' solution, to
promote reuse of shared intermediate results. We propose two variants,
SUSTain_M and SUSTain_T, to handle both matrix and tensor inputs, respectively.
We evaluate SUSTain against several state-of-the-art baselines on both
synthetic and real Electronic Health Record (EHR) datasets. Comparing to those
baselines, SUSTain shows either significantly better fit or orders of magnitude
speedups that achieve a comparable fit (up to 425X faster). We apply SUSTain to

clusters). Furthermore, 87% of them were validated as clinically meaningful

subclasses with progenitor a CO$_{\rm core}$, undergoing a supernova (SN)
explosion and hypercritically accreting in a tight binary system onto a
companion neutron star (NS) or black hole (BH). In XRFs the NS does not reach
by accretion the critical mass and no BH is formed. In BdHNe I, with shorter
binary periods, the NS gravitationally collapses and leads to a new born BH. In
BdHNe II the accretion on an already formed BH leads to a more massive BH. We
assume that the GeV emission observed by \textit{Fermi}-LAT originates from the
rotational energy of the BH. Consequently, we verify that, as expected, in XRFs
no GeV emission is observed. In $16$ BdHNe I and $5$ BdHNe II, within the
boresight angle of LAT, the integrated GeV emission allows to estimate the
initial mass and spin of the BH. In the remaining $27$ sources in the plane of
the binary system no GeV emission occurs, hampered by the presence of the HN
ejecta. From the ratio, $21/48$, we infer a new asymmetric morphology for the
BdHNe reminiscent of the one observed in active galactic nuclei (AGN): the GeV
emission occurs within a cone of half-opening angle $\approx 60^{\circ}$ from
the normal to the orbital plane of the binary progenitor. The transparency
condition requires a Lorentz factor $\Gamma \sim 1500$ on the source of GeV
emission. The GeV luminosity in the rest-frame of the source follows a

electronic structure calculations required for conformational sampling. We
introduce the concept of a deformation potential and demonstrate its existence
by the proof-by-construction approach. A statistical description of the
fluctuations in the deformation potential due to non-zero temperature was
obtained using infinite-order moment expansion of the distribution. The formal
mathematical definition of the ESP was derived using functional minimization
approach to match the infinite-order moment expansion for the deformation
potential. Practical implementation of the ESP was obtained using the
random-matrix theory method. The developed method was applied to two
proof-of-concept calculations of the distribution of HOMO-LUMO gap in the water
molecule and solvated CdSe clusters at 300K. The need for large sample size to
obtain statistically meaningful results was demonstrated by performing $10^5 $
ESP calculations. The results from these prototype calculations demonstrated
the efficacy of the ESP method for performing efficient conformational
sampling. We envision that the fundamental nature of this work will not only
extend our knowledge of chemical systems at non-zero temperatures but will also
generate new insights for innovative technological applications.

of the anisotropy is essentially determined by the properties of the weaker

time, which are not accessible by direct numerical simulations. Thus, idealized
subvolumes are often used to study small-scale effects including the dynamics
of turbulence. These turbulent boxes require an artificial driving in order to
mimic energy injection from large-scale processes. In this Letter, we show and
quantify how the autocorrelation time of the driving and its normalization
systematically change properties of an isothermal compressible
magnetohydrodynamic flow in the sub- and supersonic regime and affect
astrophysical observations such as Faraday rotation. For example, we find that
$\delta$-in-time forcing with a constant energy injection leads to a steeper
slope in kinetic energy spectrum and less efficient small-scale dynamo action.
In general, we show that shorter autocorrelation times require more power in
the acceleration field, which results in more power in compressive modes that
weaken the anticorrelation between density and magnetic field strength. Thus,
derived observables, such as the line-of-sight magnetic field from rotation
measures, are systematically biased by the driving mechanism. We argue that
$\delta$-in-time forcing is unrealistic and numerically unresolved, and
conclude that special care needs to be taken in interpreting observational
results based on the use of idealized simulations.

spectra of the systems are obtained by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation on
top of a G$_0$W$_0$ calculation which corrects the independent particle
eigenvalues obtained from density functional theory calculations. Our
calculations reveal that the lowest energy exciton in both HBLs possesses
interlayer character which is decisive regarding their possible device
applications. Due to the spatially separated nature of the charge carriers, the
binding energy of inter-layer excitons might be expected to be considerably
smaller than that of intra-layer ones. However, according to our calculations
the binding energy of lowest energy interlayer excitons is only $\sim$ 20\%
lower due to the weaker screening of the Coulomb interaction between layers of
the HBLs. Therefore, it can be deduced that the spectral positions of the
interlayer excitons with respect to intralayer ones are mostly determined by
the band offset of the constituent single-layers. By comparing oscillator
strengths and thermal occupation factors, we show that in luminescence at low

local interactions usually satisfies an area law. However, in 1D systems some
violations may appear in inhomogeneous systems or in random systems. In our
inhomogeneous system, the inhomogeneity parameter, $h$, allows us to tune
different regimes where a volumetric violation of the area law appears. We
apply the strong disorder renormalization group to describe the maximally
entangled state of the system in a strong inhomogeneity regime. Moreover, in a
weak inhomogeneity regime, we use a continuum approximation to describe the
state as a thermo-field double in a conformal field theory with an effective
temperature which is proportional to the inhomogeneity parameter of the system.
The latter description also shows that the universal scaling features of this
model are captured by a massless Dirac fermion in a curved space-time with
constant negative curvature $R=-h^2$, providing another example of the relation
between quantum entanglement and space-time geometry. The results we discuss

service providers, that may greatly benefit from its flexibility and
scalability properties. However, the diversity of possible orchestrated
services, rises the necessity of adopting specific orchestration strategies for
each service request that are unknown a priori. This paper presents Senate, a
distributed architecture that enables precise orchestration of heterogeneous
services over a common edge infrastructure. To assign shared resources to
service orchestrators, Senate uses the Distributed Orchestration Resource
Assignment (DORA), an approximation algorithm that we designed to guarantee
both a bound on convergence time and an optimal (1-1/e)-approximation with
respect to the Pareto optimal resource assignment. We evaluate advantages of
service orchestration with Senate and performance of DORA through a prototype
implementation.

player imposes a permutation $\pi$ over $V$, the other player imposes a
permutation $\sigma$ over $U$. In the greedy matching algorithm, vertices of
$U$ arrive in order $\sigma$ and each vertex is matched to the lowest (under
$\pi$) yet unmatched neighbor in $V$ (or left unmatched, if all its neighbors
are already matched). The obtained matching is maximal, thus matches at least a
half of the vertices. The max-min greedy matching problem asks: suppose the
first (max) player reveals $\pi$, and the second (min) player responds with the
worst possible $\sigma$ for $\pi$, does there exist a permutation $\pi$
ensuring to match strictly more than a half of the vertices? Can such a
permutation be computed in polynomial time?
  The main result of this paper is an affirmative answer for this question: we
show that there exists a polytime algorithm to compute $\pi$ for which for
every $\sigma$ at least $\rho > 0.51$ fraction of the vertices of $V$ are
matched. We provide additional lower and upper bounds for special families of
graphs, including regular and Hamiltonian. Interestingly, even for regular
graphs with arbitrarily large degree (implying a large number of disjoint
perfect matchings), there is no $\pi$ ensuring to match more than a fraction
$8/9$ of the vertices.
  The max-min greedy matching problem solves an open problem regarding the
welfare guarantees attainable by pricing in sequential markets with binary
unit-demand valuations. In addition, it has implications for the size of the
unique stable matching in markets with global preferences, subject to the graph
structure.

toward the cubic axes at $T < T_c$. However, this seems to simply restore the

unable to rule out dark energy dynamics. The nonflat XCDM parameterization is
compatible with the Dark Energy Survey limits on the present value of the rms

energy-momentum tensor T_{\mu\nu}, with independent metric and affine
connection (metric-affine theories). We find that the resulting field equations
share a close resemblance with their metric-affine f(R) relatives once an
effective energy-momentum tensor is introduced. As a result, the metric field
equations are second-order and no new propagating degrees of freedom arise as
compared to GR, which contrasts with the metric formulation of these theories,
where a dynamical scalar degree of freedom is present. Analogously to its
metric counterpart, the field equations impose the non-conservation of the
energy-momentum tensor, which implies non-geodesic motion and consequently
leads to the appearance of an extra force. The weak field limit leads to a
modified Poisson equation formally identical to that found in
Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity. Furthermore, the coupling of these
gravity theories to perfect fluids, electromagnetic, and scalar fields, and
their potential applications are discussed.

processing and coding theory due to their robustness to noise and transmission

coherence between pairs of vectors is minimized. Despite their usefulness and
widespread applications, ETFs of a given size $N$ are only guaranteed to exist
in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ or $\mathbb{C}^{d}$ if $N = d + 1$. This leads to the
problem of finding approximations of ETFs of $N$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ or

deletion-creation, dynamic synapses, dynamic gains) have been proposed as
examples of self-organized criticality (SOC) to explain neuronal avalanches.
However, all these systems present stochastic oscillations hovering around the
critical region that are incompatible with standard SOC. This phenomenology has
been called self-organized quasi-criticality (SOqC). Here we make a linear
stability analysis of the mean field fixed points of two SOqC systems: a fully
connected network of discrete time stochastic spiking neurons with firing rate
adaptation produced by dynamic neuronal gains and an excitable cellular
automata with depressing synapses. We find that the fixed point corresponds to
a stable focus that loses stability at criticality. We argue that when this
focus is close to become indifferent, demographic noise can elicit stochastic
oscillations that frequently fall into the absorbing state. This mechanism
interrupts the oscillations, producing both power law avalanches and dragon
king events, which appear as bands of synchronized firings in raster plots. Our
approach differs from standard SOC models in that it predicts the coexistence
of these different types of neuronal activity.

minor operations, these reduction operations do not commute in general. A Tutte
invariant for alternating dimaps is a function $ P $ defined on every

characterization of the periodic rectangular waveguide grating (RWG) structure.
Using an equivalent circuit (EC) model the dispersion equation of the structure
is derived with largely reduced workloads as compared to the conventional
field-theory method. An EC based analysis of the RWG structure is performed.
Numerical results show a good consistency between the two methods as varying
structural parameters of significance. The proposed approach is also used for
the taper design with the objective of minimizing wave reflection of the
structure. A resulting multistage taper can deliver a low cumulative reflection
coefficient on the order of 10^{-3}. Furthermore, the coherence performance of
an RWG based planar Cerenkov maser (PCM) is studied on the driving electron
beam interacting with the traveling harmonic wave. This includes the impacts of
the grating height uniformity, due to practical machining uncertainty, on the
net wave reflection as well as on the growth rate of the wave in the maser. The
obtained results show, that a non-uniformity on the order of 50 micrometers in
the grating height can increase the reflection level by at least one order of
magnitude. The PCM coherence can be considerably degraded, in terms of a
significant reduction in the wave growth rate of more than 30% with respect to
its theoretical value.

This fine correspondence indicates that the length of $\mathcal{E}_2$ captures
the contribution $s_{\mathcal{A}}(\mathcal{A}_2)$ from $\mathcal{A}_2$ to the
entanglement entropy $S_{\mathcal{A}}$, hence gives the contour function for

play an important role in powering the variable X-ray emission from radiatively
inefficient accretion flows around black holes. The trans-relativistic regime
of magnetic reconnection, where the magnetization $\sigma$, defined as the
ratio of magnetic energy density to enthalpy density, is $\sim 1$, is
frequently encountered in such flows. By means of a large suite of
two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate electron and
proton acceleration in the trans-relativistic regime. We focus on the
dependence of the electron energy spectrum on $\sigma$ and the proton $\beta$
(i.e., the ratio of proton thermal pressure to magnetic pressure). We find that
the electron spectrum in the reconnection region is non-thermal and can be
generally modeled as a power law. At $\beta \lesssim 3 \times 10^{-3}$, the
slope, $p$, is independent of $\beta$ and it hardens with increasing $\sigma$
as $p\simeq 1.8 +0.7/\sqrt{\sigma}$. Electrons are primarily accelerated by the
non-ideal electric field at X-points, either in the initial current layer or in
current sheets generated in between merging magnetic islands. At higher values
of $\beta$, the electron power law steepens for all values of $\sigma$. At
values of $\beta$ near $\beta_{\rm max}\approx1/4\sigma$, when both electrons
and protons are relativistically hot prior to reconnection, the spectra of both
species display an additional component at high energies, containing a few
percent of particles. These particles are accelerated via a Fermi-like process
by bouncing in between the reconnection outflow and a stationary magnetic
island. We provide an empirical prescription for the dependence of the
power-law slope and the acceleration efficiency on $\beta$ and $\sigma$, which
can be used in global simulations of collisionless accretion disks.

(CTC) criterion was shown as a natural end-to-end (E2E) model directly
targeting words as output units. However, the word-based CTC model suffers from
the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issue as it can only model limited number of words
in the output layer and maps all the remaining words into an OOV output node.
Hence, such a word-based CTC model can only recognize the frequent words
modeled by the network output nodes. Our first attempt to improve the
acoustic-to-word model is a hybrid CTC model which consults a letter-based CTC
when the word-based CTC model emits OOV tokens during testing time. Then, we
propose a much better solution by training a mixed-unit CTC model which
decomposes all the OOV words into sequences of frequent words and multi-letter
units. Evaluated on a 3400 hours Microsoft Cortana voice assistant task, the
final acoustic-to-word solution improves the baseline word-based CTC by
relative 12.09% word error rate (WER) reduction when combined with our proposed
attention CTC. Such an E2E model without using any language model (LM) or
complex decoder outperforms the traditional context-dependent phoneme CTC which
has strong LM and decoder by relative 6.79%.

attention recently due to the potential for providing high throughput and
causality guarantees. {\em Global stabilization} is a technique established for
achieving causal consistency in distributed multi-version key-value store
systems, adopted by the previous work such as GentleRain
\cite{Du2014GentleRainCA} and Cure \cite{akkoorath2016cure}. Intuitively, this
approach serializes all updates by their physical time and computes the
``Global Stable Time'' which is a time point $t$ such that versions with
timestamp $\leq t$ can be returned to the client without violating causality.
However, all previous designs with global stabilization assume {\em full
replication}, where each data center stores a full copy of data, and each
client is restricted to access servers within one data center. In this paper,
we propose a theoretical framework to support {\em general partial replication}
with causal consistency via global stabilization, where each server can store
an arbitrary subset of the data, and each client is allowed to communicate with
any subset of the servers and migrate among them without extra delays. We
propose an algorithm that implements causal consistency for distributed
multi-version key-value stores with general partially replication. We prove the
optimality of the Global Stable Time computation in our algorithm regarding the
remote update visibility latency, i.e. how fast update from a remote server is
visible to the client, under general partial replication. We also provide
trade-offs to further optimize the remote update visibility by introducing
extra delays during client's migration. Simulation results on the performance
of our algorithm compared to the previous work are also provided.

Block Coordinate Descent algorithm (A2BCD), the first asynchronous
Nesterov-accelerated algorithm that achieves optimal complexity. This parallel
algorithm solves the unconstrained convex minimization problem, using p
computing nodes which compute updates to shared solution vectors, in an
asynchronous fashion with no central coordination. Nodes in asynchronous
algorithms do not wait for updates from other nodes before starting a new
iteration, but simply compute updates using the most recent solution
information available. This allows them to complete iterations much faster than
traditional ones, especially at scale, by eliminating the costly
synchronization penalty of traditional algorithms.
  We first prove that A2BCD converges linearly to a solution with a fast
accelerated rate that matches the recently proposed NU_ACDM, so long as the
maximum delay is not too large. Somewhat surprisingly, A2BCD pays no complexity
penalty for using outdated information. We then prove lower complexity bounds
for randomized coordinate descent methods, which show that A2BCD (and hence
NU_ACDM) has optimal complexity to within a constant factor. We confirm with
numerical experiments that A2BCD outperforms NU_ACDM, which is the current
fastest coordinate descent algorithm, even at small scale. We also derive and
analyze a second-order ordinary differential equation, which is the
continuous-time limit of our algorithm, and prove it converges linearly to a
solution with a similar accelerated rate.

often use local linearization of the dynamics in conjunction with reduced-order
abstractions to yield tractable solutions. In these model-based control
strategies, the controller is often not fully aware of many details, including
torque limits, joint limits, and other non-linearities that are necessarily
excluded from the control computations for simplicity. Deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) offers a promising model-free approach for controlling bipedal
locomotion which can more fully exploit the dynamics. However, current results
in the machine learning literature are often based on ad-hoc simulation models
that are not based on corresponding hardware. Thus it remains unclear how well
DRL will succeed on realizable bipedal robots. In this paper, we demonstrate
the effectiveness of DRL using a realistic model of Cassie, a bipedal robot. By
formulating a feedback control problem as finding the optimal policy for a
Markov Decision Process, we are able to learn robust walking controllers that
imitate a reference motion with DRL. Controllers for different walking speeds
are learned by imitating simple time-scaled versions of the original reference
motion. Controller robustness is demonstrated through several challenging
tests, including sensory delay, walking blindly on irregular terrain and
unexpected pushes at the pelvis. We also show we can interpolate between
individual policies and that robustness can be improved with an interpolated
policy.

models continue to play important roles in industrial flow simulations.
However, the commonly used linear eddy viscosity models are intrinsically
unable to handle flows with non-equilibrium turbulence. Reynolds stress models,
on the other hand, are plagued by their lack of robustness. Recent studies in
plane channel flows found that even substituting Reynolds stresses with errors
below 0.5% from direct numerical simulation (DNS) databases into RANS equations
leads to velocities with large errors (up to 35%). While such an observation
may have only marginal relevance to traditional Reynolds stress models, it is
disturbing for the recently emerging data-driven models that treat the Reynolds
stress as an explicit source term in the RANS equations, as it suggests that
the RANS equations with such models can be ill-conditioned. So far, a rigorous
analysis of the condition of such models is still lacking. As such, in this
work we propose a metric based on local condition number function for a priori
evaluation of the conditioning of the RANS equations. We further show that the
ill-conditioning cannot be explained by the global matrix condition number of
the discretized RANS equations. Comprehensive numerical tests are performed on
turbulent channel flows at various Reynolds numbers and additionally on two
complex flows, i.e., flow over periodic hills and flow in a square duct.
Results suggest that the proposed metric can adequately explain observations in
previous studies, i.e., deteriorated model conditioning with increasing
Reynolds number and better conditioning of the implicit treatment of Reynolds
stress compared to the explicit treatment. This metric can play critical roles
in the future development of data-driven turbulence models by enforcing the
conditioning as a requirement on these models.

anomalous Hall resistivity,longitudinal resistivity(LR) and magnetoresistance,
enabled by this approach, reveals the following. The side-jump mechanism gives
a dominant contribution to anomalous Hall resistivity (AHR) in the CFS thin
films, regardless of the degree of disorder present. A new and novel
contribution to both LR and AHR characterized by the logarithmic temperature
dependence at temperatures below the minimum, exclusive to the amorphous CFS
films, originates from the scattering of conduction electrons from the
diffusive hydrodynamic modes associated with the longitudinal component of
magnetization, called diffusons. In these amorphous CFS films, the
electron-diffuson, e d, scattering and weak localization (WL) mechanisms
compete with that arising from the inelastic electron magnon, e m, scattering
to produce the minimum in longitudinal resistivity, whereas the minimum in AHR
is caused by the competing contributions from the e d and e m scattering, as WL
does not make any contribution to AHR. In sharp contrast, in crystalline films,
enhanced electron electron Coulomb interaction (EEI), which is basically
responsible for the resistivity minimum, makes no contribution to AHR with the
result that AHR does not exhibit a minimum.

they often provide significant improvements over stochastic gradient descent
(SGD). Rigorously speaking, ""fast gradient"" methods have provable improvements
over gradient descent only for the deterministic case, where the gradients are
exact. In the stochastic case, the popular explanations for their wide
applicability is that when these fast gradient methods are applied in the
stochastic case, they partially mimic their exact gradient counterparts,
resulting in some practical gain. This work provides a counterpoint to this
belief by proving that there exist simple problem instances where these methods
cannot outperform SGD despite the best setting of its parameters. These
negative problem instances are, in an informal sense, generic; they do not look
like carefully constructed pathological instances. These results suggest (along
with empirical evidence) that HB or NAG's practical performance gains are a
by-product of mini-batching.
  Furthermore, this work provides a viable (and provable) alternative, which,
on the same set of problem instances, significantly improves over HB, NAG, and
SGD's performance. This algorithm, referred to as Accelerated Stochastic
Gradient Descent (ASGD), is a simple to implement stochastic algorithm, based
on a relatively less popular variant of Nesterov's Acceleration. Extensive

scheme with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) to perform efficient and reliable
data transfer with increased throughput across multiple coexisting wireless
body area networks (BANs) in a tiered architecture. We investigate the proposed
scheme using two distributed cross-layer optimized dynamic routing techniques,
i.e., shortest path routing (SPR) and cooperative multi-path routing (CMR). The
channel state information from the physical layer is passed on to the network
layer using an adaptive cross-layer carrier sensing mechanism between the
physical and MAC layer, which adjusts the carrier sense threshold (e.g., RSSI)
periodically based on the slowly-varying channel condition. An open-access
experimental dataset of 'everyday' mixed-activities is used for analyzing the
cross-layer optimization. Our proposed optimization using adaptive carrier
sensing performs better than static carrier sensing with CSMA/CA as it reduces
the continuous back-off duration and latency as well as significantly increases
the throughput (in successful packets/s) by more than 50%. Adaptive CSMA/CA
also shows 20% and 6% improvement over a coordinated TDMA approach with higher
duty cycle for throughput and spectral efficiency, respectively, and provides
acceptable packet delivery ratio and outage probability with respect to SINR.

actuators, and one by one each robot moves upwards by crawling, rolling or
hopping up the slope. In this paper, we present a human devised autonomous
climbing algorithm and evaluate it using a high-fidelity dynamics simulator.
The climbing surfaces contain impassable obstacles and some loosely held rocks

plan and navigate up or down these steep environments. Autonomous mapping and
navigation capability is evaluated using simulated lasers, vision sensors. The
human devised planning algorithm uses a new algorithm called bounded-leg A*.

charge-state distribution. The electron temperature is presently inferred from
a Li-like ion level population ratio, but it is necessary to obtain an

directly probes the distribution of plasma particle velocities with respect to
a central probe frequency. It is a powerful diagnostic which can produce time

density, ion temperature, and average ionization. In this paper, we explore a
possible design for an optical Thomson scattering system to supplement X-ray

crossover between two and three dimensions generates prominent fat-tailed
non-Gaussian distributions with intermittency accompanied by colossal
chain-like structures with densely populated self-organized vortices
(serpentinely organized vortices (SOV)). The promotion is caused by a sudden
increase of the available phase space at the crossover length scale. Since the
discovered intermittency can involve much larger energies than those in the
conventional intermittency in small spatial scales, it governs extreme events
and chaotic unpredictability in the synoptic weather system.

much attention in machine learning, especially for large-scale applications
with high-dimensional data. One popular way to implement sparse learning is to
use $L_1$ regularization. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called
proximal \mbox{SCOPE}~(\mbox{pSCOPE}), for distributed sparse learning with
$L_1$ regularization. pSCOPE is based on a \underline{c}ooperative
\underline{a}utonomous \underline{l}ocal \underline{l}earning~(\mbox{CALL})
framework. In the \mbox{CALL} framework of \mbox{pSCOPE}, we find that the data
partition affects the convergence of the learning procedure, and subsequently
we define a metric to measure the goodness of a data partition. Based on the
defined metric, we theoretically prove that pSCOPE is convergent with a linear
convergence rate if the data partition is good enough. We also prove that
better data partition implies faster convergence rate. Furthermore, pSCOPE is
also communication efficient. Experimental results on real data sets show that
pSCOPE can outperform other state-of-the-art distributed methods for sparse
learning.

has been geologically well documented at Milankovitch timescales, controlled in
part by climatically (insolation) driven sea-level changes. At the longer (tens
of Myr) timescales connection between astronomical parameters and sedimentation
via cyclic solar-system motions within the Milky Way has also been proposed,
but this hypothesis remains controversial because of the lack of long
geological records. The absence of a physical mechanism that could explain the
connection between climate and astronomy at these longer timescales led to the
explanation of plate motions as the main driver of climate on Earth.
  Here we statistically show a prominent and persistent ~36 Myr sedimentary
cyclicity superimposed on two megacycles (~250 Myr) in a relatively
well-constrained sea-level (SL) record of the past 542 Myr (Phanerozoic eon).
  Given the possible link between amplitudes of the ~36 and ~250 Myr
cyclicities in SL record and the potential that these periodicities fall into
the frequency band of solar system motions, we suggest an astronomical origin,
and model these periodicities as originating from the path of the solar system
in the Milky Way as vertical and radial periods that modulate the flux of
cosmic rays on Earth. Our finding of the ~36 Myr SL cyclicity lends credibility
to the existing hypothesis about the imprint of solar-system vertical period on
the geological record. The ~250 Myr megacycles are tentatively attributed to a
radial period. However, the tectonic drivers also remain potentially plausible.
  The potential existence of a correlation between the modeled astronomical
signal and the geological record may offer an indirect proxy to understand the

regularization terms (e.g. Truncated K-space Division or TKD; Morphology
Enabled Dipole Inversion or MEDI) to solve the ill-conditioned deconvolution
problem. Unfortunately, they either require long multiple orientation scans or
suffer from artifacts. To overcome these shortcomings, a deep neural network,
QSMnet, is constructed to generate a high quality susceptibility map from
single orientation data. The network has a modified U-net structure and is
trained using gold-standard COSMOS QSM maps. 25 datasets from 5 subjects (5
orientation each) were applied for patch-wise training after doubling the data
using augmentation. Two additional datasets of 5 orientation data were used for
validation and test (one dataset each). The QSMnet maps of the test dataset
were compared with those from TKD and MEDI for image quality and consistency in
multiple head orientations. Quantitative and qualitative image quality
comparisons demonstrate that the QSMnet results have superior image quality to
those of TKD or MEDI and have comparable image quality to those of COSMOS.
Additionally, QSMnet maps reveal substantially better consistency across the
multiple orientations than those from TKD or MEDI. As a preliminary
application, the network was tested for two patients. The QSMnet maps showed
similar lesion contrasts with those from MEDI, demonstrating potential for

seam, the multistate electronic Hamiltonian is extended by introducing biasing
potentials into the off-diagonal elements, and the molecular dynamics is
continued on a modified potential energy surface obtained by diagonalization of
the latter. The off-diagonal bias serves to locally open the energy gap and
push the system to the next intersection point. In this way, the conical
intersection energy landscape can be explored, identifying minimum energy
crossing points and the barriers separating them. We illustrate the method on
the example of furan, a prototype organic molecule exhibiting rich
photophysics. The multistate metadynamics reveals plateaus on the conical
intersection energy landscape from which the minimum energy crossing points
with characteristic geometries can be extracted. The method can be combined

minimize the H-inf- norm of the dynamical distribution network subject to
allocation of the weights on the edges. It is shown that this optimization
problem can be formulated as a semi-definite program. Next we consider the
semi-definiteness of the weighted graph Laplacian matrix with negative weights
on the edges. A necessary and sufficient condition, using the effective

of the Laplacian matrix. Furthermore, the bounded real lemma is derived for
state-space symmetric systems.

bandwidth-hungry applications of mobile Internet, the demand of wireless data
traffic and ubiquitous mobile broadband is rapidly increasing. On account of
these developments, the research on fifth generation (5G) networks presents an
accelerative tendency on a global scale. Edge computing draw lots of attention
for reducing the time delay and improving the Quality of Service for the
networks. While, fog radio access networks (F-RANs) is an emergent
architecture, which takes full use of edge computing and distributed storing
capabilities in edge devices. In this article, we propose an architecture of
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based F-RANs, which has a strong
capability of edge computing and can meet the heterogeneous requirements in 5G
systems. NOMA with successive interference cancellation (SIC) is regarded as a
critical multi-user access technology. In NOMA, more than one user can access
the same time, code domain, and frequency resources. With assigning different
power levels to multi-user and implementing SIC, multiple users detection can
be achieved. In this article, we provide a description of the NOMA based F-RANs
architecture, and discuss the resource allocation in that. We will focus on the
power and subchannel allocation in consideration of using NOMA and the edge
caching. Simulation results show that the proposed NOMA baesd F-RANs
architecture and the resource management mechanisms can achieve the high net
utility for the RANs.

important for both fundamental research and for the realization of devices
including electron resonators, interferometers and interference-based spin
filters. Consistent with the principles of subwavelength optics, the wave
nature of electrons can give rise to various types of interference effects,
such as Fabry-P\'erot resonances, Fano resonances and the Aharonov-Bohm effect.
Quantum-interference conductance oscillations have indeed been predicted for
multiwall carbon nanotube shuttles and telescopes, and arise from atomic-scale
displacements between the inner and outer tubes. Previous theoretical work on
graphene bilayers indicates that these systems may display similar interference
features as a function of the relative position of the two sheets. Experimental
verification is, however, still lacking. Graphene nanoconstrictions represent
an ideal model system to study quantum transport phenomena due to the
electronic coherence and the transverse confinement of the carriers. Here, we
demonstrate the fabrication of bowtie-shaped nanoconstrictions with
mechanically controlled break junctions (MCBJs) made from a single layer of
graphene. We find that their electrical conductance displays pronounced
oscillations at room temperature, with amplitudes that modulate over an order
of magnitude as a function of sub-nanometer displacements. Surprisingly, the
oscillations exhibit a period larger than the graphene lattice constant.
Charge-transport calculations show that the periodicity originates from a
combination of quantum-interference and lattice-commensuration effects of two
graphene layers that slide across each other. Our results provide direct
experimental observation of Fabry-P\'erot-like interference of electron waves
that are partially reflected/transmitted at the edges of the graphene bilayer
overlap region.

existence result which allows us, in particular, to obtain new insights on the
existence of weak solutions to a class of L\'evy-driven SDEs with Borel

illustrate the Markovian selection theorem with applications in the theory of

explicitly violate global symmetries. The majoron necessarily decays to

have been the focus of much recent research due to their numerous theoretical
and practical applications. An important goal is to obtain the best possible
tradeoffs between the number of queries the algorithm makes to its oracle (the
locality of the task), and the amount of redundancy in the encoding (the
information rate).
  In Hamming's classical adversarial channel model, the current tradeoffs are
dramatic, allowing either small locality, but superpolynomial blocklength, or
small blocklength, but high locality. However, in the computationally bounded,
adversarial channel model, proposed by Lipton (STACS 1994), constructions of
locally decodable codes suddenly exhibit small locality and small blocklength,
but these constructions require strong trusted setup assumptions e.g.,
Ostrovsky, Pandey and Sahai (ICALP 2007) construct private locally decodable
codes in the setting where the sender and receiver already share a symmetric
key.
  We study variants of locally decodable and locally correctable codes in
computationally bounded, adversarial channels, in a setting with no public-key
or private-key cryptographic setup. The only setup assumption we require is the
selection of the public parameters (seed) for a collision-resistant hash
function. Specifically, we provide constructions of relaxed locally correctable
and relaxed locally decodable codes over the binary alphabet, with constant
information rate, and poly-logarithmic locality.
  Our constructions, which compare favorably with their classical analogues in
the computationally unbounded Hamming channel, crucially employ
collision-resistant hash functions and local expander graphs, extending ideas
from recent cryptographic constructions of memory-hard functions.

applications in which the intrinsic dimension of high-dimensional data is often
smaller than the ambient dimension. Spectral clustering, as one of the main
approaches to subspace clustering, often takes on a sparse representation or a
low-rank representation to learn a block diagonal self-representation matrix
for subspace generation. However, existing methods require solving a large
scale convex optimization problem with a large set of data, with computational
complexity reaches O(N^3) for N data points. Therefore, the efficiency and
scalability of traditional spectral clustering methods can not be guaranteed
for large scale datasets. In this paper, we propose a subspace clustering model
based on the Kronecker product. Due to the property that the Kronecker product
of a block diagonal matrix with any other matrix is still a block diagonal
matrix, we can efficiently learn the representation matrix which is formed by
the Kronecker product of k smaller matrices. By doing so, our model
significantly reduces the computational complexity to O(kN^{3/k}). Furthermore,
our model is general in nature, and can be adapted to different regularization
based subspace clustering methods. Experimental results on two public datasets
show that our model significantly improves the efficiency compared with several
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we have conducted experiments on synthetic

supporting and stabilising agricultural sector. In 1962, EU policy-makers
developed the so-called Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) to ensure
competitiveness and a common market organisation for agricultural products,
while 2003 reform decouple the CAP from the production to focus only on income
stabilization and the sustainability of agricultural sector. Notwithstanding
farmers are highly dependent to public support, literature on the role played
by the CAP in fostering agricultural performances is still scarce and
fragmented. Actual CAP policies increases performance differentials between
Northern Central EU countries and peripheral regions. This paper aims to
evaluate the effectiveness of CAP in stimulate performances by focusing on
Italian lagged Regions. Moreover, agricultural sector is deeply rooted in
place-based production processes. In this sense, economic analysis which omit
the presence of spatial dependence produce biased estimates of the
performances. Therefore, this paper, using data on subsidies and economic
results of farms from the RICA dataset which is part of the Farm Accountancy
Data Network (FADN), proposes a spatial Augmented Cobb-Douglas Production
Function to evaluate the effects of subsidies on farm's performances. The major
innovation in this paper is the implementation of a micro-founded quantile
version of a spatial lag model to examine how the impact of the subsidies may
vary across the conditional distribution of agricultural performances. Results
show an increasing shape which switch from negative to positive at the median
and becomes statistical significant for higher quantiles. Additionally, spatial
autocorrelation parameter is positive and significant across all the
conditional distribution, suggesting the presence of significant spatial
spillovers in agricultural performances.

the possible simplified models, including the well-motivated cases in which the
extra scalar or fermion is a Standard Model particle, as well as the possible
connection to neutrino masses. We compute the contributions to direct detection
from the photon, the $Z$ and the Higgs penguins for arbitrary quantum numbers

limits, i.e., when all new particles are heavier than the dark matter mass and
when the fermion running in the loop is light, like a Standard Model lepton. We

counterparts, White-Fi must obey requirements that protect TV reception. As a
result, optimization of citywide White-Fi networks faces the challenges of
heterogeneous channel availability and link quality, over location. The former
is because, at any location, channels in use by TV networks are not available
for use by White-Fi. The latter is because the link quality achievable at a
White-Fi receiver is determined by not only its link gain to its transmitter
but also by its link gains to TV transmitters and its transmitter's link gains
to TV receivers.
  In this work, we model the medium access control (MAC) throughput of a
White-Fi network. We propose heuristic algorithms to optimize the throughput,
given the described heterogeneity. The algorithms assign power, access
probability, and channels to nodes in the network, under the constraint that
reception at TV receivers is not compromised. We evaluate the efficacy of our
approach over example city-wide White-Fi networks deployed over Denver and
Columbus (respectively, low and high channel availability) in the USA, and
compare with assignments cognizant of heterogeneity to a lesser degree, for
example, akin to FCC regulations.

fixed points of standard or contractive interference mappings, and the
conventional fixed point algorithm is widely used for this purpose. Knowing
that the mapping used in the algorithm is not only standard but also
contractive (or only contractive) is valuable information because we obtain a
guarantee of geometric convergence rate, and the rate is related to a property
of the mapping called modulus of contraction. To date, contractive mappings and
their moduli of contraction have been identified with case-by-case approaches
that can be difficult to generalize. To address this limitation of existing
approaches, we show in this study that the spectral radii of asymptotic
mappings can be used to identify an important subclass of contractive mappings
and also to estimate their moduli of contraction. In addition, if the fixed
point algorithm is applied to compute fixed points of positive concave
mappings, we show that the spectral radii of asymptotic mappings provide us
with simple lower bounds for the estimation error of the iterates. An immediate
application of this result proves that a known algorithm for load estimation in

photometric monitoring from 2012 to 2016. The measured variability shows a
periodicity of 125 +- 5 days, which we interpret as the signature of the
stellar rotation period. This value overrules previous suggestions of a
significantly shorter stellar rotation period. A light curve inversion of the
monitoring data yields an estimation of the flux dimming of a permanent spot
filling factor not contributing to the photometric variability, a temperature
contrast of the spots of about 370 K and persistent active longitudes. The
derived surface maps over all five seasons were used to estimate the influence
of the star spots on the transmission spectrum of the planet from 400 nm to
2000 nm. The monitoring data presented here do not support a recent
interpretation of a measured transmission spectrum of GJ 1214b as to be caused
by bright regions in the stellar photosphere. Instead, we list arguments as to
why the effect of dark spots likely dominated over bright regions in the period
of our monitoring. Furthermore, our photometry proves an increase in
variability over at least four years, indicative for a cyclic activity
behavior. The age of GJ 1214 is likely between 6 and 10 Gyr. The long-term
photometry allows for a correction of unocculted spots. For an active star such
as GJ 1214, there remains a degeneracy between occulted spots and the transit
parameters used to build the transmission spectrum. This degeneracy can only be
broken by high-precision transit photometry resolving the spot crossing

classical renewal theory for one dimensional random walk killed at the first
exit from the positive half-line are extended to a multi-dimensional setting.
For this purpose, an analogue of the ladder height process and the
corresponding renewal function $V$ are introduced. The results are applied to
multidimensional random walks killed upon the times of first exit from a convex
cone. Our approach combines large deviation estimates and an extension of
Choquet-Deny theory.

generalized to include the vibrational degrees of freedom. The pertinent
Hamiltonian is constructed up to next-to-leading order. The leading order part
describes the vibrational motion, and the NLO part couples rotations to
vibrations. The applicability of the EFT Hamiltonian is examined through the
description of the energy spectra of the ground state bands, $\gamma$-bands,
and $K=4$ bands in the $^{108, 110, 112}$Ru isotopes. It is found that by
taking into account the vibrational degrees of freedom, the deviations for
high-spin states in the $\gamma$-band observed in the EFT with only rotational
degrees of freedom disappear. This supports the importance of including
vibrational degrees of freedom in the EFT formulation for the collective motion
of triaxially deformed nuclei.

quantified with a simplistic figure of merit (FoM). The coverage and capacity
KPIs are assessed through simulations while an analytical approach is developed
for mobility. The key message is that the FoM degrades with the higher as the
frequencies increase in this range. This indicates that there will be more
challenges in deploying millimeter wave systems in higher frequencies, but
these are not insurmountable. Many of these challenges are addressed in the

probe the properties of the interstellar medium in the nearby anti-centre
region. We have jointly modelled the $\gamma$-ray intensity and the stellar
reddening, E(B-V) as a combination of H$_{\rm I}$-bright, CO-bright, and
ionised gas components. The complementary information from dust reddening and
$\gamma$ rays is used to reveal the dark gas not seen, or poorly traced, by
H$_{\rm I}$, free-free, and $^{12}$CO emissions. We compare the total gas
column densities, $N_{\rm{H}}$, derived from the $\gamma$ rays and stellar
reddening with those inferred from a similar analysis (Remy et al. 2017) of
$\gamma$ rays and of the optical depth of the thermal dust emission,
$\tau_{353}$, at 353 GHz. We can therefore compare environmental variations in
specific dust reddening, E(B-V)/$N_{\rm H}$, and in dust emission opacity (dust
optical depth per gas nucleon), $\tau_{353}/N_{\rm{H}}$. Over the whole
anti-centre region, we find an average E(B-V)/$N_{\rm H}$ ratio of
$(2.02\pm0.48)\times$ $10^{-22}$~mag~cm$^2$, with maximum local variations of
about $\pm30\%$ at variance with the two to six fold coincident increase seen
in emission opacity as the gas column density increases. In the diffuse medium,
the small variations in specific reddening, E(B-V)/$N_{\rm H}$ implies a rather
uniform dust-to-gas mass ratio in the diffuse parts of the anti-centre clouds.
The small amplitude of the E(B-V)/$N_{\rm H}$ variations with increasing
$N_{\rm{H}}$ column density confirms that the large opacity
$\tau_{353}/N_{\rm{H}}$ rise seen toward dense CO clouds is primarily due to
changes in dust emissivity. The environmental changes are qualitatively
compatible with model predictions based on mantle accretion on the grains and
the formation of grain aggregates.

have shown that, for premixed flames freely propagating in narrow adiabatic
channels, the instabilities induced by differential diffusion may result in
non-symmetric solutions and/or oscillating and rotating propagation modes. This
has been shown in the context of lean mixtures, for which a single species
transport equation with a single Lewis number (corresponding to the ratio of
thermal to molecular diffusivity of the deficient reactant) can be used to
describe the flame propagation problem. In the present work we extend the
analysis to mixtures of any equivalence ratio. To this end, we consider a
two-reactant model, where the different diffusivities of the two reactants
introduce two different Lewis numbers. Steady-state computations and linear
stability analysis are carried out for mixtures with large disparity between
the Lewis number of the fuel (LeF) and the oxidizer (LeO), such as
hydrogen-oxygen systems. It is shown that both differential diffusion and
preferential diffusion have influence on the stability of the symmetric flame
shape. For sufficiently lean and rich mixtures, the flame behaves as dictated
by the Lewis number of the deficient reactant, i.e., the flame destabilizes
toward non-symmetric solutions for large mass flow rates when the mentioned
Lewis number is less than one. In near-stoichiometric mixtures the stability of
the symmetric flame depends on a weighted average value of LeF and LeO. In
particular, the symmetric solution is stable for large mass flow rates because
of the difficulties found by the less diffusive reactant to reach the reactive
zone of the flame.

content available from professional programmer support forums (e.g.
StackOverflow.com) to determine potential defectiveness of a given piece of
source code. The defectiveness is expressed on the scale of {Likely defective,
Neutral, Unlikely to be defective}. Basic idea employed in the tool is to: a)
Identify a set P of discussion posts on StackOverflow such that each p in P
contains source code fragment(s) which sufficiently resemble the input code C
being reviewed. b) Determine the likelihood of C being defective by considering
all p in P . A novel aspect of our approach is to use document fingerprinting
for comparing two pieces of source code. Our choice of document fingerprinting
technique is inspired by source code plagiarism detection tools where it has
proven to be very successful. In the experiments that we performed to verify
effectiveness of our approach source code samples from more than 300 GitHub

from thermal to approximately 325 keV neutron energy, performed in the
high-flux experimental area (EAR2) of the n_TOF facility at CERN. This reaction
plays a key role in the lithium yield of the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) for
standard cosmology. The only two previous time-of-flight measurements performed
on this reaction did not cover the energy window of interest for BBN, and
showed a large discrepancy between each other. The measurement was performed
with a Si-telescope, and a high-purity sample produced by implantation of a
$^{7}$Be ion beam at the ISOLDE facility at CERN. While a significantly higher
cross section is found at low-energy, relative to current evaluations, in the
region of BBN interest the present results are consistent with the values
inferred from the time-reversal $^{7}$Li($p, n$)$^{7}$Be reaction, thus
yielding only a relatively minor improvement on the so-called Cosmological
Lithium Problem (CLiP). The relevance of these results on the near-threshold
neutron production in the p+$^{7}$Li reaction is also discussed.

delivery of files in a given content library to users through a deterministic
error-free network where a common multicast message is sent to all users at a
fixed rate, independent of the number of users. In order to apply this paradigm
to a wireless network, it is important to make sure that the common multicast
rate does not vanish as the number of users increases. This paper focuses on a
variant of coded caching successively proposed for the so-called combination
network, where the multicast message is further encoded by a Maximum Distance
Separable (MDS) code and the MDS-coded blocks are simultaneously transmitted
from different Edge Nodes (ENs) (e.g., base stations or access points). Each
user is equipped with multiple antennas and can select to decode a desired
number of EN transmissions, while either nulling of treating as noise the
others, depending on their strength. The system is reminiscent of the so-called
evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (eMBMS), in the sense that the
fundamental underlying transmission mechanism is multipoint multicasting, where
each user can independently and individually (in a user-centric manner) decide
which EN to decode, without any explicit association of users to ENs. We study
the performance of the proposed system when users and ENs are distributed
according to homogeneous Poisson Point Processes in the plane and the
propagation is affected by Rayleigh fading and distance dependent pathloss. Our
analysis allows the system optimization with respect to the MDS coding rate.
Also, we show that the proposed system is fully scalable, in the sense that it
can support an arbitrarily large number of users, while maintaining a
non-vanishing per-user delivery rate.

are two-sided layouts that draw some edges as curves in the exterior of the

and two-page book drawings, i.e., graph layouts with all vertices placed on a
line (the spine) and edges drawn in one or two distinct half-planes (the pages)
bounded by the spine. In this paper we study the problem of minimizing the
crossings for a fixed cyclic vertex order by computing an optimal $k$-plane set
of exteriorly drawn edges for $k \ge 1$, extending the previously studied case
$k=0$. We show that this relates to finding bounded-degree maximum-weight
induced subgraphs of circle graphs, which is a graph-theoretic problem of

efficient algorithm for $k=1$, and generalize it to an explicit \XP-time

implemented our algorithm and present experimental results that confirm the

The higher barriers inherent for superoleophobic surfaces promoted the

proposea risk-aware HUman-Machine cOoperation framework for ER, denoted by
r-HUMO. Built on the existing HUMO framework, r-HUMO similarly enforces both
precision and recall levels by partitioning an ER workload between the human
and the machine. However, r-HUMO is the first solution to optimize the process
of human workload selection from a risk perspective. It iteratively selects
human workload based on real-time risk analysis on human-labeled results as
well as prespecified machine metrics. In this paper,we first introduce the
r-HUMO framework and then present the risk analysis technique to prioritize the
instances for manual labeling. Finally,we empirically evaluate r-HUMO's
performance on real data. Our extensive experiments show that r-HUMO is
effective in enforcing quality guarantees,and compared with the
state-of-the-art alternatives, it can achieve better quality control with
reduced human cost.

only a small percentage of the known isolated neutron stars, there are almost
certainly many more of them, since most magnetars were discovered in transitory

outburst, in fact, a magnetar can be brighter in X-rays by orders of magnitude
and usually emit powerful bursts of hard-X/soft-gamma-ray photons that can be
detected almost everywhere in the Galaxy with all-sky monitors such as those on
board the Fermi satellite or the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Magnetars
command great attention because the large progress that has been made in their
understanding is proving fundamental to fathom the whole population of isolated
neutron stars, and because, due to their extreme properties, they are relevant
for a vast range of different astrophysical topics, from the study of gamma-ray
bursts and superluminous supernovae, to ultraluminous X-ray sources, fast radio

$\Gamma$ point near the Fermi level is about 1.7 eV, much larger than the
values (0.5--1 eV) of other layered semiconductors, indicating much stronger
vdW interactions in metallic layered borophene. In particular, the critical
strains are enhanced by increasing the number of layers, leading to much more
flexibility than that of monolayer structure. On the one hand, because of the
buckled atomic structures, the out-of-plane negative Poisson's ratios are
preserved as the layer-number increases. On the other hand, we find that the
in-plane negative Poisson's ratios disappear in layered borophene, which is
very different from puckered black phosphorus. The negative Poisson's ratio
will recover if we enlarge the interlayer distance to 6.3 $\mbox\AA$,

the strong interlayer vdW interactions in layered borophene.

of spacetime at the smallest scales in terms of atoms of spacetime, capturing
their effects through a scalar $\rho$, function of the point $P$ and the vector
$v^a$ at $P$, expressing their density. This has been done in the Euclideanized
space one obtains through analytic continuation from Lorentzian sector at $P$.
$\rho$ is defined in terms of a peculiar `effective' metric $q_{ab}$, also
recently introduced, which stems from a careful request that $q_{ab}$ coincides
with $g_{ab}$ at large (space/time) distances, but gives finite distance in the
coincidence limit.
  This work reports on an attempt to introduce a definition of $\rho$ directly
in the Lorentz sector. This turns out to be not a so trivial task, essentially
because of the null case, i.e. when $v^a$ is null, as in this case we lack even
a concept of $q_{ab}$. A notion for $q_{ab}$ in the null case is here proposed
and an expression for it is derived. In terms of it, an expression for $\rho$
can be derived, which turns out to coincide with what obtained from analytic
continuation. This, joined with the consideration of timelike/spacelike cases,
potentially completes a description of $q_{ab}$ and $\rho$ within Lorentz
spacetimes.

CNNs. Our work is based on the linear relationship identified in different

relationship implies that the information in CNNs is redundant. Our method
eliminates the redundancy in convolutional filters by applying subspace
clustering to feature maps. In this way, most of the representative information
in the network can be retained in each cluster. Therefore, our method provides
an effective solution to filter pruning for which most existing methods
directly remove filters based on simple heuristics. The proposed method is
independent of the network structure, thus it can be adopted by any
off-the-shelf deep learning libraries. Experiments on different networks and
tasks show that our method outperforms existing techniques before fine-tuning,
and achieves the state-of-the-art results after fine-tuning.

be partially reactive due to pores with sufficient surface area for chemical
reactions, that are continuously transformed by cosmic-rays. Calculation
results show that surface reactions generally enhance the deuteration for at
least several molecules. However, once they are buried and become mantle
molecules, they lose their deuteration over a timescale of 10 million years due
to processes in the mantle. If deuterated species in young star-forming regions
come from grain mantles, a cautious conclusion is that the freeze-out of
molecules, perhaps, should not occur more than 10 Myr before the mantle

continuous and its location is not sensitive to the depth of the groove.
However for walls which are partially wet by liquid, where the transition is
first-order, we show that the pressure at which it occurs is determined by a
modified Kelvin equation characterized by an edge contact angle $\theta_E$
describing the shape of the meniscus formed at the top of the groove. The
dependence of $\theta_E$ on the groove depth $D$ relies, in turn, on whether
corner menisci are formed at the bottom of the groove in the low density
gas-like phase. While for macroscopically wide grooves these are always present
when $\theta<45\degree$ we argue that their formation is inhibited in narrow
grooves. This has a number of implications including that the local pining of
the meniscus and location of the condensation transition is different depending
on whether the contact angle is greater or less than a universal value
$\theta^*\approx 31\degree$. Our arguments are supported by detailed
microscopic density functional theory calculations which show that the modified

introduce a method whereby PIMD can be incorporated into a DFT simulation with
little extra cost and little loss in accuracy. The method is based on the many

correction to the DFT energy. Our method calculates intramolecular forces using
the highly accurate monomer potential energy surface developed by
Partridge-Schwenke, which is cheap to evaluate. Intermolecular forces and
energies are calculated with DFT only once per timestep using the centroid
positions. We show how our method may be used in conjunction with a multiple
time step algorithm for an additional speedup and how it relates to ring
polymer contraction and other schemes that have been introduced recently to
speed up PIMD simulations. We show that our method, which we call ""monomer

to share the bandwidth to meet the demands of minimum average distortion

problems, bits are directly assigned in proportion to their complexity measures
and we call it look-ahead allocation model (LAM), which leads to the fact that
the performance will totally depend on the accuracy of the complexity measures.
This paper proposes a look-ahead and feedback allocation model (LFAM) for joint
rate allocation for High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) platform which requires
negligible computational cost. We derive the model from the target function of
minVAR theoretically. The bits are assigned according to the complexity
measures, the distortion and bitrate values fed back by the encoder together.
We integrated the proposed allocation model in HEVC reference software HM16.0

demonstrate that our proposed LFAM performs better than LAM, and an average of
65.94% variance of mean square error (MSE) is saved with different complexity

MIMO) in Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) systems. Due to the large frequency
separation between Uplink (UL) and Downlink (DL), in FDD systems channel
reciprocity does not hold. Hence, in order to provide DL channel state
information to the Base Station (BS), closed-loop DL channel probing and
Channel State Information (CSI) feedback is needed. In massive MIMO this incurs
typically a large training overhead. For example, in a typical configuration
with M = 200 BS antennas and fading coherence block of T = 200 symbols, the
resulting rate penalty factor due to the DL training overhead, given by max{0,
1 - M/T}, is close to 0. To reduce this overhead, we build upon the well-known
fact that the Angular Scattering Function (ASF) of the user channels is
invariant over frequency intervals whose size is small with respect to the
carrier frequency (as in current FDD cellular standards). This allows to
estimate the users' DL channel covariance matrix from UL pilots without
additional overhead. Based on this covariance information, we propose a novel
sparsifying precoder in order to maximize the rank of the effective sparsified
channel matrix subject to the condition that each effective user channel has
sparsity not larger than some desired DL pilot dimension T_{dl}, resulting in
the DL training overhead factor max{0, 1 - T_{dl} / T} and CSI feedback cost of
T_{dl} pilot measurements. The optimization of the sparsifying precoder is
formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Program, that can be efficiently solved.
Extensive simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
approach with respect to concurrent state-of-the-art schemes based on
compressed sensing or UL/DL dictionary learning.

standard deviation for each individual, which in stage two is used as a

saliency models were based on low-level hand-crafted feature derived from
insights gained in neuroscience and psychophysics. In the wake of deep learning
breakthrough, a new cohort of models were proposed based on neural network
architectures, allowing significantly higher gaze prediction than previous
shallow models, on all metrics.
  However, most models treat the saliency prediction as a \textit{regression}

problem. Furthermore, it is unclear that intermediate levels of saliency (ie,
neither very high, nor very low) are meaningful: Something is either salient,
or it is not.

problem as a salient region \textit{segmentation} problem. We demonstrate that

Telescopio Nazionale Galileo, the 4.2m William Herschel telescope and the 10.4m
Gran Telescopio Canarias. We characterize 115 new PSZ1 sources using deep
optical imaging and spectroscopy. We adopt robust criteria in order to
consolidate the SZ counterparts by analysing the optical richness, the 2D
galaxy distribution, and velocity dispersions of clusters. Confirmed
counterparts are considered to be validated if they are rich structures, well
aligned with the Planck PSZ1 coordinate and show relatively high velocity
dispersion. Following this classification, we confirm 53 clusters, which means
that 46% of this PSZ1 subsample has been validated and characterized with this
technique. Sixty-two SZ sources (54% of this PSZ1 subset) remain unconfirmed.
In addition, we find that the fraction of unconfirmed clusters close to the
galactic plane (at |b|<25deg) is greater than that at higher galactic latitudes
(|b|>25deg), which indicates contamination produced by radio emission of
galactic dust and gas clouds on these SZ detections. In fact, in the majority
of the cases, we detect important galactic cirrus in the optical images, mainly
in the SZ target located at low galactic latitudes, which supports this
hypothesis.

Our data structure allows us to insert a new site in $S$, delete a site from

All distances are measured using the geodesic distance, that is, the length of
the shortest path that is completely contained in $P$. Our data structure
achieves polylogarithmic update and query times, and uses $O(n\log^3n\log m +
m)$ space, where $n$ is the number of sites in $S$ and $m$ is the number of
vertices in $P$. The crucial ingredient in our data structure is an implicit
representation of a vertical shallow cutting of the geodesic distance

the $k$-dimensional torus $T^k$. In terms of these data a construction of the

The number $d=n-k$ is called the complexity of an $(2n,k)$-manifold. Our theory
comprises toric geometry and toric topology, where $d=0$. It is shown that the
class of homogeneous spaces $G/H$ of compact Lie groups, where rk$G=$rk$H$,

immense research efforts up to date oxygen evolution electrocatalysts based on
earth-abundant elements work efficiently and stably in neutral and alkaline
regimes. However, non-noble metal-based anode materials that can withstand low
pH regimes are considered to be an indispensable prerequisite for the water
splitting to succeed in the future. All oxygen evolving electrodes working
durably and actively in acids contain Ir at least as an additive. Due to its
scarcity and high acquisition costs noble elements like Pt, Ru and Ir need to
be replaced by earth abundant elements. We have evaluated a Ni containing
stainless steel for use as an oxygen-forming electrode in diluted H2SO4.
Unmodified Ni42 steel showed a significant weight loss after long term OER
polarization experiments. Moreover, a substantial loss of the OER performance
of the untreated steel specimen seen in linear sweep voltammetry measurements
turned out to be a serious issue. However, upon anodization in LiOH, Ni42 alloy
was rendered in OER electrocatalysts that exhibit under optimized synthesis
conditions stable overpotentials down to 445 mV for 10 mA cm-2 current density
at pH 0. Even more important: The resulting material has proven to be robust
upon long-term usage (weight loss: 20 mug/mm2 after 50 ks of
chronopotentiometry at pH 1) towards OER in H2SO4. Our results suggest that
electrochemical oxidation of Ni42 steel in LiOH (sample Ni42Li205) results in
the formation of a metal oxide containing outer zone that supports solution
route-based oxygen evolution in acidic regime accompanied by a good stability
of the catalyst.

practical issues that need to be taken care of when measuring global spin

correction for the effect of finite acceptance in pseudorapidity, and the
consideration for measuring the azimuthal angle dependence. Insights and

regression algorithms. While being initially designed as batch algorithms,
several variants have been proposed to handle online learning. One particular
instance of such forests is the \emph{Mondrian Forest}, whose trees are built
using the so-called Mondrian process, therefore allowing to easily update their
construction in a streaming fashion. In this paper, we provide a thorough
theoretical study of Mondrian Forests in a batch learning setting, based on new
results about Mondrian partitions. Our results include consistency and
convergence rates for Mondrian Trees and Forests, that turn out to be minimax
optimal on the set of $s$-H\""older function with $s \in (0,1]$ (for trees and
forests) and $s \in (1,2]$ (for forests only), assuming a proper tuning of
their complexity parameter in both cases. Furthermore, we prove that an
adaptive procedure (to the unknown $s \in (0, 2]$) can be constructed by
combining Mondrian Forests with a standard model aggregation algorithm. These
results are the first demonstrating that some particular random forests achieve
minimax rates \textit{in arbitrary dimension}. Owing to their remarkably simple
distributional properties, which lead to minimax rates, Mondrian trees are a
promising basis for more sophisticated yet theoretically sound random forests
variants.

decreasing the kinetic temperature of baryons, which could be achieved through
the scattering between the baryons and cold dark matter particles. It seems
that the most researched dark matter annihilation model is not able to explain
such a large amplitude, since the interactions between the particles produced
by the dark matter annihilation and the particles that have been present in the
Universe could increase the baryonic temperature. Recently, C. Feng and G.
Holder have suggested that the large amplitude in the global 21 cm spectrum
could be produced by considering the possible excess of the early radio

bi-adjoint scalar field theory has been proved by Arkhani-Hamed et al. We argue
that hyperbolic geometry constitutes a natural framework to address the study
of positive geometries in moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, and thus to try to
extend this achievement beyond tree level. In this paper we begin an
exploration of these ideas starting from the simplest example of hyperbolic
geometry, the hyperbolic plane. The hyperboloid model naturally guides us to
re-discover the moduli space Associahedron, and a new version of its
kinematical avatar. As a by-product we obtain a solution to the scattering
equations which can be interpreted as a special case of the two well known
solutions in terms of spinor-helicity formalism. The construction is done in
$1+2$ dimensions and this makes harder to understand how to extract the
amplitude from the dlog of the space time Associahedron. Nevertheless, we
continue the investigation accommodating a loop momentum in the picture. By
doing this we are led to another polytope called Halohedron, which was already
known to mathematicians. We argue that the Halohedron fulfils many criteria
that make it plausible to be understood as a 1-loop Amplituhedron for the cubic
theory. Furthermore, the hyperboloid model again allows to understand that a
kinematical version of the Halohedron exists and is related to the one living
in moduli space by a simple generalisation of the tree level map.

and control action spaces, we introduce a general (universally applicable)
dynamic programming formulation, establish its well-posedness, and provide new
existence results for optimal policies. Our dynamic program builds in part on
Witsenhausen's standard form, but with a different formulation for the state,
action, and transition dynamics. Using recent results on measurability
properties of strategic measures in decentralized control, we obtain a standard
Borel controlled Markov model. This allows for a well-defined dynamic
programming recursion through universal measurability properties of the value
functions for each time stage. In addition, new existence results are obtained
for optimal policies in decentralized stochastic control. These state that for
a static team with independent measurements, it suffices for the cost function
to be continuous (only) in the actions for the existence of an optimal policy
under mild compactness (or tightness) conditions. These also apply to dynamic
teams which admit static reductions with independent measurements through a
change of measure transformation. We show through a counterexample that weaker
conditions may not lead to existence of an optimal team policy. The paper's
existence results generalize those previously reported in the literature. A
summary of and comparison with previously reported results and some

  limits",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The goal in {\em reconfiguration problems} is to compute a {\em gradual
transformation} between two feasible solutions of a problem such that all
intermediate solutions are also feasible. In the {\em Matching Reconfiguration
Problem} (MRP), proposed in a pioneering work by Ito et al.\ from 2008, we are
given a graph $G$ and two matchings $M$ and $M'$, and we are asked whether
there is a sequence of matchings in $G$ starting with $M$ and ending at $M'$,
each resulting from the previous one by either adding or deleting a single edge
in $G$, without ever going through a matching of size $< \min\{|M|,|M'|\}-1$.
Ito et al.\ gave a polynomial time algorithm for the problem.
  In this paper we introduce a natural generalization of the MRP that depends
on an integer parameter $\Delta \ge 1$: here we are allowed to make $\Delta$
changes to the current solution rather than 1 at each step of the
{transformation procedure}. There is always a valid sequence of matchings
transforming $M$ to $M'$ if $\Delta$ is sufficiently large, and naturally we
would like to minimize $\Delta$. We first devise an optimal transformation
procedure for unweighted matching with $\Delta = 3$, and then extend it to
weighted matchings to achieve asymptotically optimal guarantees. The running
time of these procedures is linear.
  We further demonstrate the applicability of this generalized problem to
dynamic graph matchings. In this area, the number of changes to the maintained
matching per update step (the \emph{recourse bound}) is an important quality
measure. Nevertheless, the \emph{worst-case} recourse bounds of almost all
known dynamic matching algorithms are prohibitively large, much larger than the
corresponding update times. We fill in this gap via a surprisingly simple
black-box reduction: Any dynamic algorithm for maintaining [...]

these. Approach 1 is often called null hypothesis testing but I prefer the
phrase ""baseline hypothesis"": this is the standard approach in many areas of

generalisation of the idea of confidence intervals, or as the application of
Bayes' theorem. Unlike Approach 1, Approach 2 provides a tentative estimate of
the probability of hypotheses of interest. For both approaches, I explain, from
first principles, building only on ""common sense"" statistical concepts like
averages and randomness, both how to derive answers, and the rationale behind
the answers. This is achieved by using computer simulation methods (resampling
and bootstrapping using a spreadsheet available on the web) which avoid the use
of probability distributions (t, normal, etc). Such a minimalist, but
reasonably rigorous, analysis is particularly useful in a discipline like
statistics which is widely used by people who are not specialists. My intended

effects in rectangular thin films and prisms with several finite thicknesses
under applied magnetic fields with arbitrary angle $\theta$ with the surface.
The results are compared with the same situation with isotropic ${\bf E}({\bf

penetration and a general increase of the magnitude of the magnetization with
the angle $\theta$ but a minimum at the remnant state of the magnetization
loop. The prism model presents current paths with 3D bending for all angles
$\theta$. The average current density over the thickness agrees very well with
the thin film model except for the highest angles. The prism hysteresis loops
reveal a peak after the remnant state, which is due to the parallel component
of the self-magnetic-field and is implicitly neglected for thin films. The
presented numerical method shows the capability to take force-free situations
into account for general 3D situations with a high number of degrees of

population, i.e., the luminosity functions, and size and spectral coefficients

We apply Uspec to the SDSS/CMASS sample of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs). We
construct selection cuts that match those used to build this LRG sample, which
we then apply to data and simulations in the same way. The resulting real and
simulated average spectra show a good statistical agreement overall, with
residual differences likely coming from a bluer galaxy population of the
simulated sam- ple. We also do not explore the impact of non-solar element
ratios in our simulations. For a quantitative comparison, we perform Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) of the sets of spectra. By comparing the PCs
constructed from simulations and data, we find good agree- ment for all
components. The distributions of the eigencoefficients also show an appreciable
overlap. We are therefore able to properly simulate the LRG sample taking into
account the SDSS/BOSS instrumental responses. The differences between the two
samples can be ascribed to the intrinsic properties of the simulated galaxy

in recent years to be a possible catalytic host to oxygen reduction
reaction(ORR), as well as a possible ferromagnet at room temperature.
Substitution by C in hBN has been also reported to form islands of graphene. In
this work, we explore from first principles, the connection between these
different aspects of C doped hBN. We find formation of graphene islands
covering unequal number of B and N sites in hBN to be energetically plausible.
They possess a net non-zero magnetic moment and are also found to be
substantially more chemically active than their non-magnetic counterparts
covering equal number of B and N sites. On-site Coulomb repulsion between
electrons, known to be responsible for magnetism in bipartite lattices like
graphene and hBN, is also found to play a central role in chemical activation
of not only the C atoms at the zigzag interface of magnetic graphene islands
and hBN, but also of boron(B) sites in the immediate hBN neighborhood. However,
such activated B or C due to substitution at B site, which is energetically
more favorable than at N site, has been reported to be unfavorable for ORR.
Advantageously, we find that the activation of C at B sites moderates
systematically with increasing size of graphene islands, paving the way for
abundance of efficient catalytic sites at the edges of magnetic graphene
islands covering more B sites than N sites. Accordingly, as an alternate to
precious metals for electrodes, we propose a class of graphene-hBN hybrids with
lattices of magnetic graphene islands embedded in hBN, which can be metallic.

mitigate these limitations. In this paper, we address the fundamental question

saturation, where power-conversion efficiency (PCE) is high, we show that given
a power constraint, operating in a less saturated regime, where PCE is lower,
supports a wider bandwidth and a larger number of spatial dimensions, thereby
maximizing capacity. This design strategy increases the capacity of submarine

  Arbitrary Dimension","This paper is largely improving the former arXiv:1512.05982 now

direct problem is to look for an operator ${\cal{D}}_1$ generating the
compatibility conditions (CC) ${\cal{D}}_1\eta=0$ of ${\cal{D}}\xi=\eta$. We
may thus construct a differential sequence with successive operators
${\cal{D}},{\cal{D}}_1,{\cal{D}}_2, ...$, where each operator is generating the
CC of the previous one. Introducing the formal adjoint $ad( )$, we have
${\cal{D}}_i\circ {\cal{D}}_{i-1}=0 \Rightarrow ad({\cal{D}}_{i-1}) \circ
ad({\cal{D}}_i)=0$ but $ad({\cal{D}}_{i-1})$ may not generate all the CC of
$ad({\cal{D}}_i)$. When $D=K[d_1,...,d_n]=K[d]$ is the (non-commutative) ring
of differential operators with coefficients in a differential field $K$, it
gives rise by residue to a differential module $M$ over $D$. The homological
extension modules $ext^i(M)=ext^i_D(M,D)$ with $ext^0(M)=hom_D(M,D)$ only
depend on $M$ and are measuring the above gaps, independently of the previous
differential sequence.The purpose of this rather technical paper is to compute
them for certain Lie operators involved in the formal theory of Lie
pseudogroups in arbitrary dimension $n$. In particular, we prove that the
extension modules highly depend on the Vessiot structure constants $c$. When
one is dealing with a Lie group of transformations or, equivalently, when
${\cal{D}}$ is a Lie operator of finite type, then we shall prove that
$ext^i(M)=0, \forall 0\leq i \leq n-1$. It will follow that the Riemann-Lanczos
and Weyl-Lanczos problems just amount to prove such a result for $i=2$ and
arbitrary $n$ when ${\cal{D}}$ is the Killing or conformal Killing operator. We
finally prove that ${ext}^i(M)=0, \forall i\geq 1$ for the Lie operator of
infinitesimal contact transformations with arbitrary $n=2p+1$. Most of these
new results have been checked by means of computer algebra.

often develop variant software of the original one depends on customers' needs.
The main hypothesis of this paper states that the software when it evolves over
the time, its code continues to grow, change and become more complex. This
paper proposes an automatic approach (Iris) to examine the proposed hypothesis.
Originality of this approach is the exploiting of the software variants to
study the impact of software evolution on the software metrics. This paper
presents the results of experiments conducted on three releases of drawing
shapes software, sixteen releases of rhino software, eight releases of mobile

  Solution and Analysis","6 pages, 5 figures",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a new communication protocol for a cooperative
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system. In this system, based on users'
channel conditions, each two NOMA users are paired to reduce system complexity.
In this concern, the user with a better channel condition decodes and then
forwards messages received from the source to the user with a worse channel
condition. In particular, the direct link between the paired users is assumed
to be unavailable due to the weak transmission conditions. To overcome this
issue, we propose a new cooperative NOMA protocol in which an
amplify-and-forward (AF) relay is employed to help the user-to-user
communications. To evaluate the proposed protocol, the exact closed-form
expressions of outage probability (OP) at the two paired users are derived.
Based on the analysis of the OP, we further examine the system throughput in a
delay-sensitive transmission mode. Finally, our analytical results verified by
Monte-Carlo simulation show that the proposed protocol is efficient in
enhancing the performance of NOMA system when the user-to-user communications
is limited.

  Approach","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1709.07346",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to its characteristics, there is a trend in biometrics to use the ECG
signal for personal identification. Recent works based on compression models
have shown that these approaches are suitable to ECG biometric identification.
However, the best results are usually achieved by the methods that, at least,
rely on one point of interest of the ECG.
  In this work, we propose a compression-based non-fiducial method, that uses a
measure of similarity, called the Normalized Relative Compression -- a measure
related to the Kolmogorov complexity of strings. Our method uses
extended-alphabet finite-context models (xaFCMs) on the quantized first-order
derivative of the signal, instead of using directly the original signal, as
other methods do.
  We were able to achieve state-of-the-art results on a database collected at
the University of Aveiro, which was used on previous works, making it a good
preliminary benchmark for the method.

of the most interesting topics in computational neuroscience. However, the
majority of the studies on detecting communities of a functional connectivity

and not from correlation. This lack of studies, in part, is due to the fact
that many common methods for clustering graphs require the nodes of the network
to be `positively' linked together, a property that is guaranteed by a
coherency matrix, by definition. However, correlation matrices reveal more
information regarding how each pair of nodes are linked together. In this
study, for the first time we simultaneously examine four inherently different
network clustering methods (spectral, heuristic, and optimization methods)
applied to the functional connectivity networks of the CA1 region of the
hippocampus of an anaesthetized rat during pre-ictal and post-ictal states. The
networks are obtained from correlation matrices, and its results are compared
with the ones obtained by applying the same methods to coherency matrices. The
correlation matrices show a much finer community structure compared to the
coherency matrices. Furthermore, we examine the potential smoothing effect of
choosing various window sizes for computing the correlation/coherency matrices.

demonstrated that chaos synchronization quality is robust to 10-15 % parameter
mismatches. It is also elucidated that for the intermediary noise intensity
correlation between the synchronized junctions can be even enhanced; however
for larger intensities of noise synchronization quality deteriorates. It is
also established that synchronization quality between some junctions remains
unchanged, despite the fact that all the driven junctions and the driver

importance for obtaining the high power system of Josephson junctions in
