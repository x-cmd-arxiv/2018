patterns in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reflecting human adaption
that optimizes population survival in differing environments. This paper
mathematically models environmentally induced adaptive forces that quantify
changes in the distribution of SNP frequencies between populations. We make
direct connections between biophysical methods (e.g. minimizing genomic free
energy) and concepts in population genetics. Our unbiased computer program
scanned a large set of SNPs in the major histocompatibility complex region, and
flagged an altitude dependency on a SNP associated with response to oxygen
deprivation. The statistical power of our double-blind approach is demonstrated
in the flagging of mathematical functional correlations of SNP
information-based potentials in multiple populations with specific
environmental parameters. Furthermore, our approach provides insights for new
discoveries on the biology of common variants. This paper demonstrates the
power of biophysical modeling of population diversity for better understanding
genome-environment interactions in biological phenomenon.

calculations within generalized gradient approximation (GGA) plus spin-orbit
coupling (SOC). It is found that $\mathrm{YbI_2}$ monolayer is an indirect-gap
semiconductor using both GGA and GGA+SOC. The calculations reveal that Yb-$4f$
orbitals constitute isolated highly localized bands below the Fermi level at
the absence of SOC, and the bands are split into the $j = 7/2$ and $j = 5/2$
states with SOC. The isolated highly localized bands can lead to very large
Seebeck coefficient and very low electrical conductivity in p-type doping by
producing very large effective mass of the carrier. It is proved that isolated
highly localized bands have very strong stability again strain, which is very
important for practical application. When the onsite Coulomb interaction is
added to the Yb-$4f$ orbitals, isolated highly localized bands persist, and
only their relative positions in the gap change. These findings open a new
window to search for novel electronic structures in 2D materials.

determine the feasibility and resources required to yield atmospheric
constraints. We assess these questions and leverage an information content
analysis to determine observing strategies for yielding high precision
spectroscopy in transmission and emission. Our goal is to guide observing
strategies of temperate terrestrial planets in preparation for the early JWST
cycles. First, we explore JWST's current capabilities and expected spectral
precision for targets near the saturation limits of specific modes. In doing
so, we highlight the enhanced capabilities of high efficiency readout patterns
that are being considered for implementation in Cycle 2. We propose a partial
saturation strategy to increase the achievable precision of JWST's NIRSpec
Prism. We show that JWST has the potential to detect the dominant absorbing gas
in the atmospheres of temperate terrestrial planets by the 10th transit using
transmission spectroscopy techniques in the near-IR. We also show that stacking
$\gtrapprox$10 transmission spectroscopy observations is unlikely to yield
significant improvements in determining atmospheric composition. For emission
spectroscopy, we show that the MIRI LRS is unlikely to provide robust
constraints on the atmospheric composition of temperate terrestrial planets.
Higher precision emission spectroscopy at wavelengths longward of those
accessible to MIRI LRS, as proposed in the Origins Space Telescope concept,
could help improve the constraints on molecular abundances of temperate
terrestrial planets orbiting M-dwarfs.

reduction and the variance estimate we show that the one-step boosted forest
has a significant reduction in predictive mean squared error and thus an
improvement in predictive performance. When applied on datasets from the UCI
database, one-step boosted forest performs better than random forest and
gradient boosting machine algorithms. Theoretically we can also extend such a
boosting process to more than one step and the same principles outlined in this
paper can be used to find variance estimates for such predictors. Such boosting
will reduce bias even further but it risks over-fitting and also increases the
computational burden.

effective due to proximity effect) superfluids and are proposed to be used for
constructing topological qubits for topologically protected quantum computing.
Existing theories on the subject are mostly based on BCS mean-field theory
which breaks particle number conservation (U(1) symmetry). More specifically,
Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations are used to derive Majorana zero modes and
their braiding properties. The broken particle number conservation is, on the
other hand, respected in any fermionic condensed matter system and therefore
may be crucial in studying quantum coherence, essential for quantum computing.
In this paper, we work towards a particle-number conserving theory by examining
the role played by particle number conservation in topological properties of
Majorana zero modes. We conclude that the latter may be affected by the former
and new theoretical framework that respects particle number conservation is
needed in establishing (or dismissing) the existence of Majorana zero modes in
p+ip superfluids and their application to topological quantum computing.

independent animals and many flowers with time-dependent content. This provides
an ensemble of realistic combinatorial optimization problems, in contrast to
previously studied models like random Satisfiability or standard TSP.
  We numerically studied the optimum harvesting of these foragers, with
parameters obtained from experiments, by using genetic algorithms. For the
distribution of travel distances, we find a power-law (or L\'evy) distribution,
as often found for natural foragers. Note, in contrast to many models, we make
no assumption about the nature of the flight-distance distribution, the power
law just emerges. This is in contrast to the TSP, where we find in the present
study an exponential tail.
  Furthermore, the optimization problem exhibits a {phase transition}, similar
to the TSP, at a critical value for the amount of nectar which can be
harvested. This phase transition coincides with a dramatic increase in the
typical running time of the optimization algorithm. For the value of the
critical exponent nu, describing the divergence of the correlation length, we
find nu=1.7(4), which is on the other hand compatible with the value found for
the TSP.
  Finally, we also present data from field experiments in Costa Rica for the
resource use for freely visiting flower bats. We found that the temporal
patterns in experiments and model agree remarkably, confirming our model. Also
the data show that the bats are able to memorize the positions of food sources
and optimize, at least partially, their routes.

unsteady motions of incompressible chemically reacting non-Newtonian fluids.
The system under consideration consists of the generalized Navier-Stokes
equations with a power-law type stress-strain relation, where the power-law
index depends on the concentration of a chemical, coupled to a
convection-diffusion equation for the concentration. This system of equations
arises in the rheology of the synovial fluid found in the cavities of synovial
joints. We prove the existence of global weak solutions of the non-stationary
model by using the Galerkin method combined with generalized monotone operator
theory and parabolic De Giorgi-Nash-Moser theory. As the governing equations
involve a nonlinearity with a variable power-law index, our proofs exploit the
framework of generalized Sobolev spaces with variable integrability exponent.

  Bootstrap",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over the course of the past decade, a variety of randomized algorithms have
been proposed for computing approximate least-squares (LS) solutions in
large-scale settings. A longstanding practical issue is that, for any given
input, the user rarely knows the actual error of an approximate solution
(relative to the exact solution). Likewise, it is difficult for the user to
know precisely how much computation is needed to achieve the desired error
tolerance. Consequently, the user often appeals to worst-case error bounds that
tend to offer only qualitative guidance. As a more practical alternative, we
propose a bootstrap method to compute a posteriori error estimates for
randomized LS algorithms. These estimates permit the user to numerically assess
the error of a given solution, and to predict how much work is needed to
improve a ""preliminary"" solution. In addition, we provide theoretical
consistency results for the method, which are the first such results in this
context (to the best of our knowledge). From a practical standpoint, the method
also has considerable flexibility, insofar as it can be applied to several
popular sketching algorithms, as well as a variety of error metrics. Moreover,
the extra step of error estimation does not add much cost to an underlying
sketching algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method
with empirical results.

negative and positive posts are shared on both platforms, Reddit posts are
focused on the sexual assaults within families and workplaces while Twitter
posts are on showing empathy and encouraging others to continue the #metoo

$\sim$0.9$-$1.1, such as in rocky solar-system building blocks (or chondrites),
to $\sim$1.2$-$1.3, such as in upper-mantle rocks (or pyrolite), have been
proposed. Geophysical evidence for subducted lithosphere deep in the mantle has
been interpreted in terms of efficient mixing and thus homogeneous Mg/Si across
most of the mantle. However, previous models did not consider the effects of
variable Mg/Si on the viscosity and mixing efficiency of lower-mantle rocks.
Here, we use geodynamic models to show that large-scale heterogeneity with
viscosity variations of $\sim$20$\times$, such as due to the dominance of
intrinsically strong (Mg,Fe)SiO$_3-$bridgmanite in low-Mg/Si domains, are
sufficient to prevent efficient mantle mixing, even on large scales. Models
predict that intrinsically strong domains stabilize degree-two
mantle-convection patterns, and coherently persist at depths of
$\sim$1,000$-$2,200 km up to the present-day, separated by relatively narrow
up-/downwelling conduits of pyrolitic material. The stable manifestation of

geographical fixity of deep-rooted mantle-upwelling centers, and fundamental
geophysical changes near 1,000 km depth (e.g. in terms of seismic-tomography

but due to the age-metallicity degeneracy of the red giant branch stars, it is
robust only over the lookback time reached by our photometry, i.e. $\sim 3$
Gyr. The most recent peak of star formation is around 10 Myr ago. The average
surface density star formation rate over the whole galaxy lifetime is $0.01$
M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$. From our study it emerges that NGC 4449 has
experienced a fairly continuous star formation regime in the last 1 Gyr with
peaks and dips whose star formation rates differ only by a factor of a few. The
very complex and disturbed morphology of NGC 4449 makes it an interesting
galaxy for studies of the relationship between interactions and starbursts, and
our detailed and spatially resolved analysis of its star formation history does

exists an upper-mass limit to stars, and if so, what physical mechanism sets
this limit, which might also determine if the upper-mass limit is metallicity
(Z) dependent. We argue that mass loss by radiation-driven winds mediated by
line opacity is one of the prime candidates setting the upper-mass limit. We
present mass-loss predictions (dM/dt_wind) from Monte Carlo radiative transfer
models for relatively cool (Teff = 15kK) inflated very massive stars (VMS) with
large Eddington Gamma factors in the mass range 100-1000 Msun as a function of
metallicity down to 1/100 Z/Zsun. We employ a hydrodynamic version of our Monte
Carlo method, allowing us to predict the rate of mass loss (dM/dt_wind) and the
terminal wind velocity (vinf) simultaneously. Interestingly, we find wind
terminal velocities (vinf) that are low (100-500 km/s) over a wide Z-range, and
we propose that the slow winds from VMS are an important source of
self-enrichment in globular clusters. We also find mass-loss rates
(dM/dt_wind), exceeding the typical mass-accretion rate (dM/dt_accr) of 0.001
Msun/yr during massive-star formation. We express our mass-loss predictions as
a function of mass and Z, finding log dM/dt = -9.13 + 2.1 log(M/Msun) + 0.74
log(Z/Zsun) (Msun/yr). Even if stellar winds would not directly halt & reverse
mass accretion during star formation, if the most massive stars form by stellar
mergers stellar wind mass loss may dominate over the rate at which stellar
growth takes place. We therefore argue that the upper-mass limit is effectively
Z-dependent due to the nature of radiation-driven winds. This has dramatic
consequences for the most luminous supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and other
black hole formation scenarios at different Cosmic epochs.

surveys allow now to study these processes in great detail at intermediate

analyze their properties, reaching systems with low stellar masses and low star
formation rates (SFRs) at intermediate-to-low redshift. We use data from the
SHARDS multiband survey in the GOODS-North field. Its depth (up to magnitude
$\langle m_{3\sigma}\rangle\sim26.5$) and its spectro-photometric resolution
($R\sim50$) provides us with an ideal dataset to search for emission line
galaxies (ELGs). We develop a new algorithm to identify low-redshift ($z$<0.36)
ELGs by detecting the [OIII]5007 and $H\alpha$ emission lines simultaneously.
We fit the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the selected sample, using a
model with two single stellar populations. We find 160 star-forming galaxies
with equivalent widths (EWs) as low as 12 {\AA}, with median values for the
sample of $\sim$ 35 {\AA} in [OIII]5007 and $\sim$ 56 {\AA} in $H\alpha$,
respectively. Results from the SED fitting show a young stellar population with
low median metallicity (36% of the solar value) and extinction ($A_V \sim$
0.37), with median galaxy stellar mass $\sim$ 10$^{8.5}$ M$_{\odot}$. Gas-phase
metallicities measured from available spectra are also low. ELGs in our sample
present bluer colors in the UVJ plane than the median color-selected
star-forming galaxy in SHARDS. We suggest a new (V-J) color criterion to
separate ELGs from non-ELGs in blue galaxy samples. In addition, several
galaxies present high densities of O-type stars. Robust fits to the full SEDs
can only be obtained including an old stellar population, suggesting the young
component is built up by a recent burst of SF in an otherwise old galaxy.

detection of [CII], [NII] and CO(2-1) line emission, making it the highest
redshift, most luminous starburst in the COSMOS field. This massive, dusty
galaxy appears to be forming stars at a rate of at least 1500$\,M_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$ in a compact region only $\sim3$ kpc in diameter. The dynamical and
dust emission properties of CRLE suggest an ongoing merger driving the
starburst, in a potentially intermediate stage relative to other known dusty
galaxies at the same epoch. The ratio of [CII] to [NII] may suggest that an
important ($\sim15\%$) contribution to the [CII] emission comes from a diffuse
ionized gas component, which could be more extended than the dense,
starbursting gas. CRLE appears to be located in a significant galaxy
overdensity at the same redshift, potentially associated with a large-scale
cosmic structure recently identified in a Lyman Alpha Emitter survey. This
overdensity suggests that CRLE and HZ10 reside in a protocluster environment,
offering the tantalizing opportunity to study the effect of a massive starburst
on protocluster star formation. Our findings support the interpretation that a
significant fraction of the earliest galaxy formation may occur from the inside
out, within the central regions of the most massive halos, while rapidly
evolving into the massive galaxy clusters observed in the local Universe.

Both methods lead to similar results up to $z \simeq 1.5$. The simulated BCGs

two factors, and in general the mass evolution in this redshift range, are in
agreement with most recent observations. The last larger factor is similar to
the growth factor obtained by a semi-analytical model (SAM). Half of the star
particles that end up in the inner 50 kpc was typically formed by redshift
$\sim$ 3.7, while the assembly of half of the BCGs stellar mass occurs on
average at lower redshifts $\sim 1.5$. This assembly redshift correlates with
the mass attained by the cluster at high $z \gtrsim 1.3$, due to the broader
range of the progenitor clusters at high-$z$. The assembly redshift of BCGs
decreases with increasing apertures. Our results are compatible with the {\it

find $t_{\rm ramp}$ is determined by the diffusion time across the system,
order $N^2$ for a 1D chain of $N$ qubits. This is analogous to the behavior
found for local one-body chaotic systems. For a $k$-local system with
conservation law the time is order $\log N$ but with a different prefactor and
a different mechanism than the scrambling time. In the absence of any

envelopes of intermediate- and high-mass stars with a magnetic field of ~kG
strength. Wind clumping close to the star and microturbulence can often be
accounted for when including small-scale, sub-photospheric density or velocity
perturbations. Compressional waves - with wavelengths comparable to or shorter
than the gas pressure scale height - can be destabilized by the radiative flux
in optically-thick media when a magnetic field is present, in a process called
the Radiation-Driven Magneto-Acoustic Instability (RMI). The instability does
not require radiation or magnetic pressure to dominate over gas pressure, and
acts independently of sub-surface convection zones. Here we evaluate the
conditions for the RMI to operate on a grid of stellar models covering a mass
range $3-40M_\odot$ at solar metallicity. For a uniform 1kG magnetic field,
fast magnetosonic modes are unstable down to an optical depth of a few tens,
while unstable slow modes extend beyond the depth of the iron convection zone.
The qualitative behavior is robust to magnetic field strength variations by a
factor of a few. When combining our findings with previous results for the
saturation amplitude of the RMI, we predict velocity fluctuations in the range
~0.1-10 km/s. These amplitudes are a monotonically increasing function of the
ratio of radiation to gas pressure, or alternatively, of the zero-age main

specific angular momentum of galaxies. Our model includes a specific treatment
for the angular momentum exchange between different galactic components. Disk
scale radii are estimated from the angular momentum of the gaseous/stellar
disk, while bulge sizes are estimated assuming energy conservation. The
predicted size--mass and angular momentum--mass relations are in fair agreement
with observational measurements in the local Universe, provided a treatment for
gas dissipation during major mergers is included. Our treatment for disk
instability leads to unrealistically small radii of bulges formed through this
channel, and predicts an offset between the size--mass relations of central and
satellite early-type galaxies, that is not observed. The model reproduces the
observed dependence of the size--mass relation on morphology, and predicts a
strong correlation between specific angular momentum and cold gas content. This
correlation is a natural consequence of galaxy evolution: gas-rich galaxies
reside in smaller halos, and form stars gradually until present day, while
gas-poor ones reside in massive halos, that formed most of their stars at early
epochs, when the angular momentum of their parent halos is low. The dynamical
and structural properties of galaxies can be strongly affected by a different
treatment for stellar feedback, as this would modify their star formation
history. A higher angular momentum for gas accreted through rapid mode does not
affect significantly the properties of massive galaxies today, but has a more
important effect on low-mass galaxies at higher redshift.

in many contexts, and which has recently found exciting applications in astro

associated with the classical Penrose process for particles. Superradiance is
usually also associated with bosonic fields around geometries with ergoregions
and horizons. These notions are in clear tension however: the Penrose process
occurs for horizonless geometries, and particles are composed of fermions.
  Here, we resolve the tension in its different aspects, by showing that (i)
superradiance occurs for self-interacting fermions on flat spacetime; (ii)
superradiance occurs also for horizonless geometries, where it leads to an
ergoregion instability. Ultracompact, horizonless geometries will usually
respond with echoes of growing amplitude, until rotational (or electrostatic)
energy is extracted from the object; (iii) the Fourier-domain analysis leads to
absence of superradiance when horizons are not present. We elucidate why this

initial conditions and the final resolution of the simulation. Lower initial
resolution simulations tend to produce smaller numbers of low mass structures.
This will strongly affect the assembly history of objects, and has the same
effect of simulating different cosmologies. The resolution of initial
conditions is an important factor in simulations, even with a fixed maximum
spatial resolution. The power spectrum of gas in simulations using AMR diverges
strongly from the fixed grid approach - with more power on small scales in the
AMR simulations - even at fixed physical resolution and also produces offsets
in the star formation at specific epochs. This is because before certain times
the upper grid levels are held back to maintain approximately fixed physical
resolution, and to mimic the natural evolution of dark matter only simulations.
Although the impact of hold back falls with increasing spatial and
initial-condition resolutions, the offsets in the star formation remain down to
a spatial resolution of 1 kpc. These offsets are of order of 10-20%, which is
below the uncertainty in the implemented physics but are expected to affect the
detailed properties of galaxies. We have implemented a new grid-hold-back
approach to minimize the impact of hold back on the star formation rate.

planets form? Planet habitability models traditionally focus on abiotic
processes and neglect a biotic response to changing conditions on an inhabited
planet. The Gaia hypothesis postulates that life influences the Earth's
feedback mechanisms to form a self-regulating system, and hence that life can
maintain habitable conditions on its host planet. If life has a strong
influence, it will have a role in determining a planet's habitability over
time. We present the ExoGaia model - a model of simple 'planets' host to
evolving microbial biospheres. Microbes interact with their host planet via
consumption and excretion of atmospheric chemicals. Model planets orbit a
'star' which provides incoming radiation, and atmospheric chemicals have either
an albedo, or a heat-trapping property. Planetary temperatures can therefore be
altered by microbes via their metabolisms. We seed multiple model planets with
life while their atmospheres are still forming and find that the microbial
biospheres are, under suitable conditions, generally able to prevent the host
planets from reaching inhospitable temperatures, as would happen on a lifeless
planet. We find that the underlying geochemistry plays a strong role in
determining long-term habitability prospects of a planet. We find five distinct
classes of model planets, including clear examples of 'Gaian bottlenecks' - a
phenomenon whereby life either rapidly goes extinct leaving an inhospitable
planet, or survives indefinitely maintaining planetary habitability. These
results suggest that life might play a crucial role in determining the
long-term habitability of planets.

Here, we investigate how far the normal metals themselves may introduce qubit

tunnelling current through the normal metal-superconductor interface as the
relevant relaxation mechanisms. We show that the ohmic loss contribution
depends strongly on the device and trap geometry, as a result of the
inhomogeneous electric fields in the qubit. The correction of the quality

the nonequilibrium distribution function of the quasiparticles. Overall, we

proved the uniqueness part of the argument in the case of small solutions. In
the main part of this paper, we develop methods to prove the convergence of the
BBGKY hierarchy to the infinite Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) hierarchy, and
separately, the uniqueness of large GP solutions. Since the trace estimate used

the finite dimensional quantum de Finetti theorem. For the large solution

framework generates a video (short clip) by decoding samples sequentially drawn
from a latent space distribution into full video frames. Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) are used as a means of encoding/decoding frames into/from
the latent space and RNN as a wayto model the dynamics in the latent space. We
improve the video generation consistency through temporally-conditional
sampling and quality by structuring the latent space with attribute controls;
ensuring that attributes can be both inferred and conditioned on during

focused on understanding the processes that generate magnetic field in stars
and which sometimes lead to a cyclic pattern of long-term variability in
activity, as demonstrated by our Sun. This area of study has recently become
more broadly pertinent to questions of exoplanet habitability and exo-space
weather, as well as stellar evolution. In contrast to other areas of stellar
research, individual stars in the solar-stellar connection often have a
distinct identity and character in the literature, due primarily to the rarity
of the decades-long time series that are necessary for studying stellar
activity cycles. Furthermore, the underlying stellar dynamo is not well
understood theoretically, and is thought to be sensitive to several stellar
properties, e.g. luminosity, differential rotation, and depth of the convection
zone, which in turn are often parameterized by other more readily available
properties. Relevant observations are scattered throughout the literature and
existing stellar databases, and consolidating information for new studies is a
tedious and laborious exercise. To accelerate research in this area I developed
sunstardb, a relational database of stellar properties and magnetic activity
proxy time series keyed by individual named stars. The organization of the data
eliminates the need for problematic catalog cross matching operations inherent
when building an analysis dataset from heterogeneous sources. In this article I
describe the principles behind sunstardb, the data structures and programming
interfaces, as well as use cases from solar-stellar connection research.

  involving error analysis and some minor changes",,"10.1007/JHEP06(2018)160",,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We have studied the $P\to\gamma^\star\gamma^\star$ transition form-factors
($P=\pi^0,\eta,\eta'$) within a chiral invariant framework that allows us to
relate the three form-factors and evaluate the corresponding contributions to
the muon anomalous magnetic moment $a_\mu$, through pseudoscalar pole
contributions. We use a chiral invariant Lagrangian to describe the
interactions between the pseudo-Goldstones from the spontaneous chiral symmetry
breaking and the massive meson resonances. We will consider just the lightest
vector and pseudoscalar resonance multiplets. Photon interactions and flavor
breaking effects are accounted for in this covariant framework. This article
studies the most general corrections of order $m_P^2$ within this setting.
Requiring short-distance constraints fixes most of the parameters entering the
form-factors, consistent with previous determinations. The remaining ones are
obtained from a fit of these form-factors to experimental measurements in the
space-like ($q^2\le0$) region of photon momenta. The combination of data,
chiral symmetry relations between form-factors and high-energy constraints
allows us to determine with improved precision the on-shell $P$-pole
contribution to the Hadronic Light-by-Light scattering of the muon anomalous
magnetic moment: we obtain $a_{\mu}^{P,HLbL}=(8.47\pm 0.16)\cdot10^{-10}$ for
our best fit. This result was obtained excluding BaBar $\pi^0$ data, which our
analysis finds in conflict with the remaining experimental inputs. This study
also allows us to determine the parameters describing the $\eta-\eta'$ system
in the two-mixing angle scheme and their correlations. Finally, a preliminary
rough estimate of the impact of loop corrections ($1/N_C$) and higher vector
multiplets (asym) enlarges the uncertainty up to $a_\mu^{P,HLbL} = (8.47\pm
0.16_{\rm sta}\pm0.09_{1/N_C}{}^{+0.5}_{-0.0}{}_{\rm asym})\cdot 10^{-10}$.

problems in an environment rich with physical interactions. The transfer of
motion planning solutions from simulation to the real world, in open-loop,
suffers from the inherent uncertainty in modelling real world physics. We
propose interleaving planning and execution in real-time, in a closed-loop
setting, using a Receding Horizon Planner (RHP) for pushing manipulation in
clutter. In this context, we address the problem of finding a suitable value
function based heuristic for efficient planning, and for estimating the
cost-to-go from the horizon to the goal. We estimate such a value function
first by using plans generated by an existing sampling-based planner. Then, we
further optimize the value function through reinforcement learning. We evaluate
our approach and compare it to state-of-the-art planning techniques for
manipulation in clutter. We conduct experiments in simulation with artificially
injected uncertainty on the physics parameters, as well as in real world tasks
of manipulation in clutter. We show that this approach enables the robot to
react to the uncertain dynamics of the real world effectively.

dynamical systems based tools and techniques. In existing studies, mixing is
generated by maps that repeat the same cut-and-shuffle process at every
iteration, in a ""fixed"" manner. However, mixing can be greatly improved by
varying the cut-and-shuffle parameters at each step, using a ""variable""
approach. To demonstrate this approach, we show how to optimize mixing by
cutting-and-shuffling on the one-dimensional line interval, known as an
interval exchange transformation (IET). Mixing can be significantly improved by
optimizing variable protocols, especially for initial conditions more complex
than just a simple two-color line interval. While we show that optimal variable
IETs can be found analytically for arbitrary numbers of iterations, for more
complex cutting-and-shuffling systems, computationally expensive numerical
optimization methods would be required. Furthermore, the number of control
parameters grows linearly with the number of iterations in variable systems.
Therefore, optimizing over large numbers of iterations is generally
computationally prohibitive. We demonstrate an ad hoc approach to
cutting-and-shuffling that is computationally inexpensive and guarantees the
mixing metric is within a constant factor of the optimum. This ad hoc approach
yields significantly better mixing than fixed IETs which are known to produce
weak-mixing, because cut pieces never reconnect. The heuristic principles of
this method can be applied to more general cutting-and-shuffling systems.

minimize the {\em expected} penalty incurred when sensor nodes experience an

sampling time on a slot-by-slot basis whilst the latter considers the best

the chance to quantitatively model the resulting relaxations. These dynamics in

hydrodynamics. In this work, we describe a model trilayer dewetting experiment
elucidating the effect of solid, no-slip confining boundaries on the bursting
of a liquid film in a viscous environment. This experiment was inspired by an
industrial polymer processing technique, multilayer coextrusion, in which
thousands of alternating layers are stacked atop one another. When pushed to
the nanoscale limit, the individual layers are found to break up on time scales
shorter than the processing time. To gain insight on this dynamic problem, we
here directly observe the growth rate of holes in the middle layer of the
trilayer films described above, wherein the distance between the inner film and
solid boundary can be orders of magnitude larger than its thickness. In
otherwise identical experimental conditions, thinner films break up faster than
thicker ones. This observation is found to agree with a scaling model that
balances capillary driving power and viscous dissipation with, crucially, a
no-slip boundary condition at the solid substrate/viscous environment boundary.
In particular, even for the thinnest middle-layers, no finite-size effect is
needed to explain the data. The dynamics of hole growth is captured by a single
master curve over four orders of magnitude in the dimensionless hole radius and
time, and is found to agree well with predictions including analytic
expressions for the dissipation.

  Our proofs rely upon the Markov (self) duality of our model. The starting

Given this transform, the crucial step is to establish self-averaging for
specific quadratic function of the transformed height function. We use the
model's two-particle self-duality to produce explicit expressions (as Bethe
ansatz contour integrals) for conditional expectations from which we extract
time-decorrelation and hence self-averaging in time. The crux of our Markov
duality method is that the entire convergence result reduces to precise
estimates on the one-particle and two-particle transition probabilities.

of particle systems to linear Gaussian SPDEs (e.g. the stochastic heat equation

materials is of great interest not only for technological applications, but
also from a theoretical point of view. The Jonscher power exponent value, and
its temperature dependence, is a very important parameter in dielectric data
analysis as well as the physical interpretation of conduction mechanisms in
disordered materials. In some cases the power exponent of AC conductivity has
been reported to be greater than 1 at the low frequency regime. This fact seems
to contradict the universal dynamic response. The present work focuses on the
analysis of dielectric spectroscopy measurements in polymeric materials, below
100 MHz. The apparent power exponent n gets values in the range (0,1) and is
directly related to the characteristics of mobile charges at shorter time
scales, in the case of the occurrence of DC conduction and the slowest
polarization mechanism that is due to the charge motions within sort length
scales, in log(epsilon'')-log(frequenvy) plot. The emergence of apparent n
values in the range [1,2], for a relatively narrow frequency range, may be
attributed to an additional molecular dipolar relaxation contribution at higher
frequencies, in log(epsilon'')-log(frequency) plot. The appearance of apparent
n values in the range (1,2], can be assigned to the existence of a well defined
minimum between DC conductivity contribution and a molecular dipolar dispersion
or between two well separated dielectric loss mechanisms, in
log(epsilon'')-log(frequency) plots, above the crossover frequency. In these
latter cases, the apparent power exponent n is merely related to the
Havriliak-Negami equation shape parameters of the higher frequencies molecular
dipolar relaxations.

demonstrate a convolutional neural network (CNN) based approach that

a CNN is trained by using pairs of randomly de-focused back-propagated

training phase, the CNN takes a single back-propagated hologram of a 3D sample
as input to rapidly achieve phase-recovery and reconstruct an in focus image of
the sample over a significantly extended DOF. This deep learning based DOF
extension method is non-iterative, and significantly improves the algorithm
time-complexity of holographic image reconstruction from O(nm) to O(1), where n

volume, and m represents the focusing search space within which each object
point or particle needs to be individually focused. These results highlight

electrostrictive coefficient Q33 as high as -3.2 m4/C2 and a resulting bulk
piezoelectric coefficient d33 up to -85 pm/V. As a result, the
electromechanical response of CIPS is comparable in magnitude to established
perovskite ferroelectrics despite possessing a much smaller spontaneous

accessible owing to low transition temperatures, CIPS exhibits large dielectric
tunability, similar to widely-used barium strontium titanate, and as a result
both giant and continuously tunable electromechanical response. The persistence
of electrostrictive and tunable responses in the paraelectric state indicates
that even few layer films or nanoparticles will sustain significant
electromechanical functionality, offsetting the inevitable suppression of
ferroelectric properties in the nanoscale limit. These findings can likely be

bisector measurement is sensitive to stellar rotation signal while H$\alpha$ is
sensitive to the secondary magnetic cycle. In general, because of their
different sensitivities these activity indicators introduce extra noise if

plutonium isotopes is investigated. A summation calculation of decay and
fission yield data is employed, and the energy dependence of the latter part is
considered in a phenomenological way. Our calculation systematically reproduces
the energy dependence of delayed neutron yields by introducing an energy
dependence of the most probable charge and the odd-even effect. The calculated
fission yields are assessed by comparison with JENDL/FPY-2011, delayed neutron
activities, and decay heats. Although the fission yields in this work are
optimized to delayed neutron yields, the calculated decay heats are in good
agreement with the experimental data. Comparison of the fission yields
calculated in this work and JENDL/FPY-2011 gave an important insight for the
evaluation of the next JENDL nuclear data.

inherent complex and intertwined structure. From the perspective of systemic
risk it is important to understand the influence of this network structure on
default contagion. Using sparse random graphs to model the financial network,
asymptotic methods turned out powerful to analytically describe the contagion
process and to make statements about resilience. So far, however, they have
been limited to so-called {\em rank one} models in which informally the only
network parameter is the degree sequence (see (Amini et. al. 2016) and
(Detering et. al. 2019) for example) and the contagion process can be described
by a one dimensional fix-point equation. These networks fail to account for a
pronounced block structure such as core/periphery or a network composed of
different connected blocks for different countries. We present a much more
general model here, where we distinguish vertices (institutions) of different
types and let edge probabilities and exposures depend on the types of both, the
receiving and the sending vertex plus additional parameters. Our main result
allows to compute explicitly the systemic damage caused by some initial local
shock event, and we derive a complete characterisation of resilient
respectively non-resilient financial systems. This is the first instance that
default contagion is rigorously studied in a model outside the class of rank
one models and several technical challenges arise. Moreover, in contrast to
previous work, in which networks could be classified as resilient or non
resilient, independent of the distribution of the shock, information about the
shock becomes important in our model and a more refined resilience condition
arises. Among other applications of our theory we derive resilience conditions
for the global network based on subnetwork conditions only.

  For the case of interpolation, the incorporation of constraints is built into
the training of the GAN. The incorporation of the constraints respects the
primary game-theoretic setup of a GAN so it can be combined with existing

  The case of extrapolation (prediction) is more involved. During training, the
GAN generator learns to interpolate a noisy version of the data and we enforce
the constraints. This approach has connections with model reduction that we can
utilize to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the training. Depending on

In this paper, we first consider a general scenario where multiple terminals

restless multi-armed bandit problem. To solve the problem efficiently, we
derive the Whittle's index in closed-form and establish the indexability

optimization to incorporate stochastic packet arrivals and optimal packet
management (buffering the latest packet). Inspired by the index policy which
has near-optimal performance but is centralized by nature, a decentralized
status update scheme, i.e., the index-prioritized random access policy (IPRA),
is further proposed, achieving universally near-optimal AoI performance and
outperforming state-of-the-arts in the literature.

polarizations from the core were corrected by considering (a) the subtraction
of the ambient polarization component, (b) the depolarization effect of
inclined distorted magnetic fields, and (c) the magnetic inclination angle of
the core. After these corrections, a linear relationship between polarization
and extinction was obtained for the core in the range up to $A_V \approx 20$
mag. The initial polarization vs. extinction diagram changed dramatically after
the corrections of (a) to (c), with the correlation coefficient being refined
from 0.71 to 0.79. These corrections should affect the theoretical
interpretation of the observational data. The slope of the finally obtained
polarization--extinction relationship is $P_H / E_{H-K_s} = 11.00 \pm 0.72$

for the SAGA method. Furthermore, we describe a Markov-driven approach of

graph. We show that our analysis applies as long as the graph is connected and,
notably, establishes an asymptotic linear convergence rate that is robust to
the graph topology. Numerical results demonstrate the merits of our algorithm

propose a novel single-shot detection framework of Bidirectional Pyramid
Networks (BPN) towards high-quality object detection, which consists of two
novel components: (i) a Bidirectional Feature Pyramid structure for more
effective and robust feature representations; and (ii) a Cascade Anchor
Refinement to gradually refine the quality of predesigned anchors for more
effective training. Our experiments showed that the proposed BPN achieves the
best performances among all the single-stage object detectors on both PASCAL
VOC and MS COCO datasets, especially for high-quality detections.

this work presents a new design and development of a tank-like robot for
structural health monitoring. Unlike most existing magnetic wheeled mobile
robot designs, which may be suitable for climbing on flat steel surface, our
proposed tank-like robot design uses reciprocating mechanism and roller-chains
to make it capable of climbing on different structural shapes (e.g., cylinder,
cube) with coated or non-coated steel surfaces. The proposed robot is able to
transition from one surface to the other (e.g., from flat surface to curving
surface).
  Taking into account of several strict considerations (including tight
dimension, efficient adhesion and climbing flexibility) to adapt with various
shapes of steel structures, a prototype tank-like robot incorporating multiple
sensors (hall-effects, sonars, inertial measurement unit and camera), has been
developed. Rigorous analysis of robot kinematics, adhesion force, sliding
failure and turn-over failure has been conducted to demonstrate the stability
of the proposed design. Mechanical and magnetic force analysis together with
sliding/turn-over failure investigation can serve as an useful framework for
designing various steel climbing robots in the future. Experimental results and
field deployments confirm the adhesion and climbing capability of the developed
robot.

characterise different configurations of a given knot as either ""local"" or

and numerical evidence that, at equilibrium, the non-local configurations are
more likely than the local ones. These characterisations are based on a
standard approach for measuring the ""size"" of a knot within a knotted polymer
chain. The method involves associating knot-types to subarcs of the chain, and
then identifying a knotted subarc with minimal arclength; this arclength is
then the knot-size. If the resulting knot-size is small relative to the whole
length of the chain, then the knot is considered to be localised or ""local"". If
on the other hand the knot-size is comparable to the length of the chain, then
the knot is considered to be ""non-local"".
  Using this definition, we establish that all but exponentially few
sufficiently long self-avoiding polygons (closed chains) in a tubular
sublattice of the simple cubic lattice are ""non-locally"" knotted. This is shown
to also hold for the case when the same polygons are subject to an external
tensile force, as well as in the extreme case when they are as compact as
possible (no empty lattice sites). We also provide numerical evidence for small
tube sizes that at equilibrium non-local knotting is more likely than local
knotting, regardless of the strength of the stretching or compressing force. We
note however that because of the tube confinement, the occurrence of non-local
knotting in walks (open chains) is significantly different than for polygons.
The relevance of these results to recent experiments involving DNA knots in
solid-state nanopores is also discussed.

and for stars lead to either compact binaries, mergers or disruptions. Studying
the inclusion of energy loss terms in few-body interactions is therefore likely
to be important for modeling and understanding the variety of transients that

especially tides in few-body codes has been shown to be technically difficult

In this paper we derive a drag force term that can be used to model the effects
from tidal, as well as other, energy losses in few-body interactions, if the

very fast to evolve, and gives results in agreement with other approaches,

especially considering the vulnerability of vehicle to vehicle message
dissemination to malicious attacks. Traditional security mechanisms, largely
based on message encryption and key management, can only guarantee secure
message exchanges between known source and destination pairs. In vehicular
networks however, every vehicle may learn its surrounding environment and
contributes as a source, while in the meantime act as a destination or a relay
of information from other vehicles, message exchanges often occur between
""stranger"" vehicles. For secure message dissemination in vehicular networks
against insider attackers, who may tamper the content of the disseminated
messages, ensuring the consistency and integrity of the transmitted messages
becomes a major concern that traditional message encryption and key management
based approaches fall short to provide. In this paper, by incorporating the
underlying network topology information, we propose an optimal decision
algorithm that is able to maximize the chance of making a correct decision on
the message content, assuming the prior knowledge of the percentage of
malicious vehicles in the network. Furthermore, a novel heuristic decision
algorithm is proposed that can make decisions without the aforementioned
knowledge of the percentage of malicious vehicles. Simulations are conducted to
compare the security performance achieved by our proposed decision algorithms
with that achieved by existing ones that do not consider or only partially
consider the topological information, to verify the effectiveness of the
algorithms. Our results show that by incorporating the network topology
information, the security performance can be much improved. This work shed
light on the optimum algorithm design for secure message dissemination.

zone(AFBZ) exhibits dramatic momentum dependence. In particular, the pseudogap
vanishes in a finite region around the anti-nodal point, in which a single
broadened peak emerges at the un-renormalized quasiparticle energy. Such an
observation is argued to be inconsistent with the antiferromagnetic(AFM)
band-folding picture, which predicts a constant pseudogap along the AFBZ
boundary. On the other hand, it is claimed that the experimental results are
consistent with the prediction of the cluster dynamical mean field
theory(CDMFT) simulation on the Hubbard model, in which the pseudogap is
interpreted as a s-wave splitting between the Hubbard bands and the in-gap
states. Here we show that the observed momentum dependence of the pseudogap is
indeed consistent with AFM band-folding picture, provided that we assume the
existence of a strongly momentum dependent quasiparticle scattering rate. More
specifically, we show that the quasiparticle scattering rate acts to reduce the
spectral gap induced by AFM band-folding effect. The new quasiparticle poles
corresponding to the AF-split bands can even be totally eliminated when the
scattering rate exceeds the bare band folding gap, leaving the system with a
single pole at the un-renormalized quasiparticle energy. We predict that the
pseudogap should close in a square root fashion as we move toward $(\pi,0)$
along the AFBZ boundary. Our results illustrates again that the quasiparticle
scattering rate can play a much more profound role than simply broadening the
quasiparticle peak in the quasiparticle dynamics of strongly correlated
electron systems.

revealed the superiority of graphdiyne overlayer originated from the steric

on the geometric shape of solute. Therefore, hydrophobic interactions may be
related to the surface roughness of solute. According to this study, hydration
repulsive force can reasonably be ascribed to the effects of surface roughness

can only be expected as the size of surface roughness being less than Rc

stabilized scalar dislocation density (SDD) and average grain size d. We
calculate both the stationary SDD $\rho(b,d,T)$ and suggest a way to calculate
$\varepsilon$-evolution of an equilibrium SDD $\rho_{\varepsilon}$ in PC sample
under quasy-static loading depending on the average size $d$ of a grain in the
range of $10^{-8}- 10^{-2}$ m, on grain boundaries orientation. The analytical
dependence is realized within a disclination-dislocation mechanism in
approximation of single dislocation ensemble for given phase and T. It is based
on a statistical model of Boltzmann-like distribution (smoothly dependent on a
strain ${\varepsilon}$) for discrete energy spectrum in each grain of a
single-mode one-phase PC material with respect to quasi-stationary levels under
plastic loading with the highest level equal to the energy of dislocation with
maximal length. The difference of equilibrium SDD, $\rho_{\varepsilon}- \rho$,
leads to a flow stress from the Taylor strain hardening mechanism containing
(for $\varepsilon$ = $0.002$) the normal and anomalous Hall-Petch relations for
coarse and nanocrystalline grains, respectively, and gains a maximum at floe
stress values for an extreme size containing $d_0$ of order $10^{-8}- 10^{-7}$

coverage deteriorates significantly at mmWave frequencies due to higher path

explore the use of passive reflectors for improving mmWave signal coverage in
NLOS indoor areas. Measurements are carried out using the PXI-based mmWave
transceiver platforms from National Instruments operating at 28 GHz, and the
results are compared with the outcomes of ray tracing (RT) simulations in a
similar environment. For both the measurements and RT simulations, different
shapes of metallic passive reflectors are used to observe the coverage (signal
strength) statistics on a receiver grid in an NLOS area. For a square metallic
sheet reflector of size 24 by 24 in and 33 by 33 in , we observe a significant
increase in the received power in the NLOS region, with a median gain of 20 dB
when compared to no reflector case. The cylindrical reflector shows more
uniform coverage on the receiver grid as compared to flat reflectors that are
more directional.

several important properties of human online activities and physical movements.
Our experiments reveal striking similarities between the cyber space and the

in the physical space, we propose a framework to study human ""mobility"" across
online platforms. We discover three interesting patterns of user engagements in

different mobility patterns also exhibit divergent preferences to online

We classify the received multipath components~(MPCs) into persistent and

potential for novel device paradigms at the nanoscale. Improper ferroelectrics
display particularly promising types of domain walls, which, due to their
unique robustness, are the ideal template for imposing specific electronic
behavior. Chemical doping, for instance, induces p- or n-type characteristics
and electric fields reversibly switch between resistive and conductive
domain-wall states. Here, we demonstrate diode-like conversion of
alternating-current (AC) into direct-current (DC) output based on neutral
180$^{\circ}$ domain walls in improper ferroelectric ErMnO$_3$. By combining
scanning probe and dielectric spectroscopy, we show that the rectification
occurs for frequencies at which the domain walls are fixed to their equilibrium
position. The practical frequency regime and magnitude of the output is
controlled by the bulk conductivity. Using density functional theory we
attribute the transport behavior at the neutral walls to an accumulation of
oxygen defects. Our study reveals domain walls acting as 2D half-wave
rectifiers, extending domain-wall-based nanoelectronic applications into the

longitudinal studies. If the mechanism leading to missing information is
non-ignorable, inference based on the observed data only may be severely

the use of individual-specific random coefficients that help capture sources of
unobserved heterogeneity and, at the same time, define a reasonable structure
of dependence between the longitudinal and the missing data process. We refer
to elements in this class as random coefficient based dropout models (RCBDMs).
We propose a dynamic, semi-parametric, version of the standard RCBDM to deal
with discrete time to event. Time-varying random coefficients that evolve over
time according to a non-homogeneous hidden Markov chain are considered to model
dependence between longitudinal responses recorded from the same subject. A
separate set of random coefficients is considered to model dependence between
missing data indicators. Last, the joint distribution of the random
coefficients in the two equations helps describe the dependence between the two
processes. To ensure model flexibility and avoid unverifiable assumptions, we
leave the joint distribution of the random coefficients unspecified and
estimate it via nonparametric maximum likelihood. The proposal is applied to
data from the Leiden 85+ study on the evolution of cognitive functioning in the

observations is the detection of a nearly continuous, 500-kpc long HI tail
which crosses the entire group. Earlier observations with the Australia
Telescope Compact Array had shown the presence of a large HI tail in this
galaxy group, but because of the much larger coverage of the new data, the full
extent of this tail is now visible. The HI mass of this structure is 3.1 +- 0.3
10^9 Msun . Based on its morphology and kinematics, we conclude that the tail
consists of gas stripped from NGC 7418 through tidal interactions, with
ram-pressure affects playing at most a minor role. Optical images of the IC
1459 group do not show many indications that galaxy interactions are common in
this group. The HI data reveal a very different picture and show that almost
all gas-rich galaxies in the IC 1459 group have a distorted HI distribution
indicating that many interactions are occurring in this group. This high number
of interactions shows that the processes that drive galaxy transformation are
also occurring in fairly loose galaxy groups.

to present multi-modal patient data, ideally combining textual, imagery,

present an open-source framework which allows handling of patient data in a
virtual reality (VR) environment. By using VR technology, the workspace
available to the surgeon is maximized and 3D patient data is rendered in
stereo, which increases depth perception. The framework organizes the data into
workspaces and contains tools which allow users to control, manipulate and
enhance the data. Due to the framework's modular design, it can easily be
adapted and extended for various clinical applications. Results: The framework
was evaluated by clinical personnel (77 participants). The majority of the
group stated that a complex surgical situation is easier to comprehend by using
the framework, and that it is very well suited for education. Furthermore, the
application to various clinical scenarios - including the simulation of
excitation-propagation in the human atrium - demonstrated the framework's
adaptability. As a feasibility study, the framework was used during the
planning phase of the surgical removal of a large central carcinoma from a

applications confirmed that the framework is easily extended and can be used in
real-time simulation as well as for the manipulation of complex anatomical
structures.

A 2020",,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The enumeration of planar maps equipped with an Eulerian orientation has
attracted attention in both combinatorics and theoretical physics since at
least 2000. The case of 4-valent maps is particularly interesting: these
orientations are in bijection with properly 3-coloured quadrangulations, while
in physics they correspond to configurations of the ice model.
  We solve both problems -- namely the enumeration of planar Eulerian
orientations and of 4-valent planar Eulerian orientations -- by expressing the
associated generating functions as the inverses (for the composition of series)
of simple hypergeometric series. Using these expressions, we derive the
asymptotic behaviour of the number of planar Eulerian orientations, thus
proving earlier predictions of Kostov, Zinn-Justin, Elvey Price and Guttmann.
This behaviour, $\mu^n /(n \log n)^2$, prevents the associated generating
functions from being D-finite. Still, these generating functions are
differentially algebraic, as they satisfy non-linear differential equations of
order $2$. Differential algebraicity has recently been proved for other map
problems, in particular for maps equipped with a Potts model.
  Our solutions mix recursive and bijective ingredients. In particular, a
preliminary bijection transforms our oriented maps into maps carrying a height
function on their vertices. In the 4-valent case, we also observe an unexpected
connection with the enumeration of maps equipped with a spanning tree that is
internally inactive in the sense of Tutte. This connection remains to be
explained combinatorially.

time-scales, of an averaged large-scale magnetic field throughout a star's life
and its coupling to stellar rotation. Large-scale magnetic fields sustained
until late stages of stellar evolution with conservation of magnetic flux could
explain the very high fields observed in white dwarfs. We include these effects
in the Cambridge stellar evolution code using three time-dependant
advection-diffusion equations coupled to the structural and composition
equations of stars to model the evolution of angular momentum and the two
components of the magnetic field. We present the evolution in various cases for
a $3\rm\,M_{\odot}$ star from the beginning to the late stages of its life. Our
particular model assumes that turbulent motions, including convection, favour
small-scale field at the expense of large-scale field. As a result the
large-scale field concentrates in radiative zones of the star and so is
exchanged between the core and the envelope of the star as it evolves. The
field is sustained until the end of the asymptotic giant branch, when it
concentrates in the degenerate core.

of the interplay of correlation effects and spin-orbit interactions in

between solid-state interactions can result in new mechanisms that minimize the
interaction energy, and in material properties of potential use for
applications. We focus here on the 5d transition metal oxide NaOsO3, a strong
candidate for the realization of a magnetically driven transition from a
metallic to an insulating state exploiting the so-called Slater mechanism.
Experimental results are derived from non-resonant and resonant x-ray single
crystal diffraction at the Os L-edges. A change in the crystallographic
symmetry does not accompany the metal-insulator transition in the Slater
mechanism and, indeed, we find no evidence of such a change in NaOsO3. An
equally important experimental observation is the emergence of the (300) Bragg
peak in the resonant condition with the onset of magnetic order. The intensity
of this space-group forbidden Bragg peak continuously increases with decreasing
temperature in line with the square of intensity observed for an allowed
magnetic Bragg peak. Our main experimental results, the absence of crystal
symmetry breaking and the emergence of a space-group forbidden Bragg peak with
developing magnetic order, support the use of the Slater mechanism to interpret
the metal-insulator transition in NaOsO3. We successfully describe our
experimental results with simulations of the electronic structure and, also,
with an atomic model based on the established symmetry of the crystal and
magnetic structure.

symmetry breaking in the context of an effective field theory. Previous
derivations were based on the condition of tree-order unitarity. However, the
modern point of view considers the Standard Model as the leading order
approximation to an effective field theory. As tree-order unitarity is in any
case violated by higher-order terms in an effective field theory, it is
instructive to investigate a formalism which can be also applied to analyze
higher-order interactions. In the current work we consider an effective field
theory of massive vector bosons interacting with a massive scalar field. We
impose the conditions of generating the right number of constraints for systems
with spin-one particles and perturbative renormalizability as well as the
separation of scales at one-loop order. We find that the above conditions
impose severe restrictions on the coupling constants of the interaction terms.
Except for the strengths of the self-interactions of the scalar field, that can
not be determined at this order from the analysis of three- and four-point
functions, we recover the gauge-invariant Lagrangian with spontaneous symmetry
breaking taken in the unitary gauge as the leading order approximation to an
effective field theory. We also outline the additional work that is required to

transmission condition, that is, the trace values of the bulk variable and the
values of the surface variable are connected via an affine relation, and this
serves to generalize the usual dynamic boundary conditions. We tackle the
problem of well-posedness via a penalization method using Robin boundary
conditions. In particular, for the relaxation problem, the strong
well-posedness and long-time behavior of solutions can be shown for more
general and possibly nonlinear relations. New difficulties arise since the
surface variable is no longer the trace of the bulk variable, and uniform
estimates in the relaxation parameter are scarce. Nevertheless, weak
convergence to the original problem can be shown. Using the approach of Colli
and Fukao (Math. Models Appl. Sci. 2015), we show strong existence to the
original problem with affine linear relations, and derive an error estimate
between solutions to the relaxed and original problems.

hexagonal ferromagnetic Fe$_{3}$Sn-based alloys have been studied from first
principles and by experiment. The pristine Fe$_{3}$Sn compound is known to
fulfill all the requirements for a good permanent magnet, except for the
magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). The latter is large, but planar,
i.e. the easy magnetization axis is not along the hexagonal c direction,
whereas a good permanent magnet requires the MAE to be uniaxial. Here we
consider Fe$_{3}$Sn$_{0.75}$M$_{0.25}$, where M= Si, P, Ga, Ge, As, Se, In, Sb,
Te and Bi, and show how different dopants on the Sn sublattice affect the MAE
and can alter it from planar to uniaxial. The stability of the doped Fe$_{3}$Sn
phases is elucidated theoretically via the calculations of their formation
enthalpies. A micromagnetic model is developed in order to estimate the energy
density product (BH)max and coercive field $\mu_{0}$H$_{c}$ of a potential
magnet made of Fe$_{3}$Sn$_{0.75}$Sb$_{0.25}$, the most promising candidate
from theoretical studies. The phase stability and magnetic properties of the
Fe$_{3}$Sn compound doped with Sb and Mn has been checked experimentally on the

alloyed with Mn. It is shown that even small structural changes, such as a
change of the c/a ratio or volume, that can be induced by, e.g., alloying with
Mn, can influence anisotropy and reverse it from planar to uniaxial and back.

non-stationary properties of the channel in the frequency and spatial domains
caused by the drift of delays. In addition, we show that the time of travel of
multi-path components (MPCs) over large-scale arrays may result in overlooked
frequency and spatial decorrelation effects. These are theoretically
demonstrated by deriving the space-time-frequency correlation functions
(STFCFs) of both narrowband and wideband Elliptical models. Closed-form
expressions of the array-variant frequency correlation function (FCF), power
delay profile (PDP), mean delay, and delay spread of single- and multi-confocal

numerical and simulation results for a particular GBSM, similar conclusions can
be extended to other GBSMs.

Introducing a three-step methodology that exploits polynomial chaos expansion,
the present paper provides a constructive approach to chance-constrained

Gaussian, for the uncertainties. We illustrate our findings by means of a

Bayesian inference. In contrast to the conventional frequentist point
estimations that might be non-representative when the distribution is highly
skewed or multi-modal, which is often the case when data points are scarce,
Bayesian statistics displays the complete posterior distribution that the
uncertainties can be readily obtained regardless of the skewness and modality.
We found that the spin period, the magnetic field strength at the light
cylinder, the spin-down power, the gamma-ray-to-X-ray flux ratio, and the
spectral curvature significance of the two groups of pulsars exhibit
significant differences at the 99\% level. Using Bayesian inference, we are
able to infer the values and uncertainties of $\delta$ and $\alpha$ from the
distribution of RQ and RL pulsars. We found that $\delta$ is between $10^\circ$

inflows within the disk. C) Jets inclined towards the disk couple more strongly

zenith angles (0 - 85 degrees). The system is located at Tien Shan
high-altitude Science Station of Lebedev Physical Institute of the Russian

this upgrade, the detector consists of ten charged particle detection points
separated by the distance up to 1.3 kilometer as well as optical detector to

permanently increase at the polarity inversion line (PIL) after eruptions,

are shown that begin to indicate the nearly Boolean nature of CRDSA which we
focus on here. We define the node set lattice through the well known binary
operations of ternary set partitions and show the resultant lattice is
isomorphic to C3^J where C3 is the 3 element chain CRDSA. We derive that every
CRDSA is a subdirect product of C3 similarly as for Boolean algebras and C2. We
use these results to show that every Boolean algebra is the center of some
CRDSA. Next we show that C3 is primal implying that the variety generated by it
is dually equivalent to the category of Boolean algebras. In some sense this is
a last step towards our goal of establishing CRDSA as nearly Boolean, but
leaves us a bit dissatisfied. Hence we continue by establishing a duality
between the category of CRDSA and specifically crafted bi-topological spaces.
Towards this end we first establish necessary and sufficient conditions on a
pairwise zero-dimensional space such that it will have a CRDSA base B1. We note
that these conditions are indicative of how nearly Boolean CRDSA are. For
example, if u in B1 is not clopen/complemented then Cl(u) is in B1 and is
clopen/complemented. Then we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for
a bi-continuous map to have an inverse that is a CRDSA homomorphism again
indicating how nearly Boolean CRDSA are, these inverses must respect the
appropriate conditions on the boundary of non-clopen elements of B1. In
culmination we show the category of core regular double Stone algebras is
dually equivalent to the category of what we call core regular double pairwise
Stone spaces. We note that the conditions for this duality can easily be
relaxed to yield a duality for a less rigid class lattices than CRDSA, bounded
distributive pseudo-complemented lattices for example.

phrases or sentences and neglect unique aspects of each image. In this work, we
propose an image captioning framework with a self-retrieval module as training
guidance, which encourages generating discriminative captions. It brings unique
advantages: (1) the self-retrieval guidance can act as a metric and an
evaluator of caption discriminativeness to assure the quality of generated
captions. (2) The correspondence between generated captions and images are
naturally incorporated in the generation process without human annotations, and
hence our approach could utilize a large amount of unlabeled images to boost
captioning performance with no additional laborious annotations. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed retrieval-guided method on COCO and Flickr30k
captioning datasets, and show its superior captioning performance with more
discriminative captions.

steps. In the first step, we aim to find a good set of matching partners for
each view. In the second step, we rank the resulting view clusters (i.e. key
views with matching partners) according to their impact on the fulfillment of
desired quality parameters such as completeness, ground resolution and
accuracy. Additional to geometric analysis, we use a novel machine learning
technique for training a confidence predictor. The purpose of this confidence
predictor is to estimate the chances of a successful depth reconstruction for
each pixel in each image for one specific MVS algorithm based on the RGB images
and the image constellation. The underlying machine learning technique does not
require any ground truth or manually labeled data for training, but instead
adapts ideas from depth map fusion for providing a supervision signal. The
trained confidence predictor allows us to evaluate the quality of image
constellations and their potential impact to the resulting 3D reconstruction
and thus builds a solid foundation for our prioritization approach. In our

optical scattering properties. Here, we consider charged colloidal suspensions,
whose effective pair interaction between colloids is described by a screened
Coulomb (Yukawa) potential. By means of adding salt ions, the pair interaction
between the charged particles can be flexibly tailored and therefore the
structural correlations are modified. It is shown that this strategy can affect
the optical properties significantly. For colloidal $\mathrm{TiO_2}$
suspensions, the modification of electric and magnetic dipole excitations
induced by the structural correlations can substantially influence the optical
scattering properties, in addition to the far-field interference effect
described by the structure factor. However, this modification is only slightly
altered by different salt concentrations and is mainly because of the
packing-density-dependent screening effect. On the other hand, for low
refractive index colloidal polystyrene suspensions, the dependent scattering
mechanism mainly involves the far-field interference effect, and the effective
exciting field amplitude for electric dipole almost remains unchanged under
different structural correlations. The present study has profound implications

At zero temperature the STIRAP pulse protocol's efficiency of the transfer
decreases exponentially with the electron-phonon coupling, until the coupling
strength is strong enough to make the process fully incoherent, in which case
the population transfer is $\frac{1}{3}$ in each level. For the FSTIRAP
protocol we find that the transferred population to target state decreases,
leaving some population on the intermediate state. Consequently, there is an
increase in the magnitude of the coherences $\rho_{01}, \rho_{12}$, albeit
small. Furthermore population transfer for non-zero temperature and effect of
coupling strength is investigated, it is observed that while both parameters
negatively influence the efficiency of transfer the former decrease the
transfer exponentially, thereby equilibrating the system fast, while the latter
seen to decrease the transfer monotonically, and hence equilibrates slowly.

outputs from the Mufasa cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, which includes
star formation, feedback, and a heuristic model to quench massive galaxies that
yields a reasonable match to a range of survey data including HI. We employ a
variety of machine learning methods (regressors), and quantify their
performance using the root mean square error ({\sc rmse}) and the Pearson
correlation coefficient (r). Considering SDSS photometry, 3$^{rd}$ nearest
neighbor environment and line of sight peculiar velocities as features, we
obtain r $> 0.8$ accuracy of the HI-richness prediction, corresponding to {\sc
rmse}$<0.3$. Adding near-IR photometry to the features yields some improvement
to the prediction. Compared to all the regressors, random forest shows the best
performance, with r $>0.9$ at $z=0$, followed by a Deep Neural Network with r
$>0.85$. All regressors exhibit a declining performance with increasing
redshift, which limits the utility of this approach to $z\la 1$, and they tend
to somewhat over-predict the HI content of low-HI galaxies which might be due
to Eddington bias in the training sample. We test our approach on the RESOLVE
survey data. Training on a subset of RESOLVE data, we find that our machine
learning method can reasonably well predict the HI-richness of the remaining
RESOLVE data, with {\sc rmse}$\sim0.28$. When we train on mock data from Mufasa

fine-tuned on a set of image classifiers (AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet-50, and

the input space to preserve and which ones to ignore, based on the information
encoded in the backpropagated gradients. Measuring the changes in accuracy when
the signal of one classifier is used by a second one, a relation of total order
emerges. This order depends directly on each classifier's input signal but it
does not correlate with classification accuracy or network size. Further
evidence of this phenomenon is provided by measuring the normalized mutual
information between original images and auto-encoded reconstructions from
different fine-tuned AEs. These findings break new ground in the area of neural

flares via gyrosynchrotron emission. We observed the alpha Cen system with the
Australian Telescope Compact Array at 2 GHz for three days and 17 GHz for one

brightness temperatures are consistent with the temperature of the upper
chromosphere of the Sun. Inverting the formulae of the free-free emission, the
average electron density of the plasma has been inferred. The same procedure
was applied to the data in the millimetre recently acquired with ALMA. A
comparison with the atmospheric solar models reveals a higher level of activity
in alpha Cen B rather than in alpha Cen A, even if still at quiescent level.
The non detection at 2 GHz allows us to put a lower limit in the filling factor

empty space without overlap. In the infinite-time limit, the density approaches
a ""saturation"" limit. Although this limit has attracted particular research
interest, the majority of past studies could only probe this limit by
extrapolation. We have previously found an algorithm to reach this limit using
finite computational time for spherical particles, and could thus determine the
saturation density of spheres with high accuracy. In this paper, we generalize
this algorithm to generate saturated RSA packings of two-dimensional polygons.
We also calculate the saturation density for regular polygons of three to ten
sides, and obtain results that are consistent with previous,
extrapolation-based studies.

prediction. To compare fully labeled training data with predictions potentially
containing abstentions, we define a wide class of asymmetric abstention-aware

problem. Thus, SOLA extends recent ideas about Structured Output Prediction via
surrogate problems and calibration theory and enjoys statistical guarantees on
the resulting excess risk. Instantiated on a hierarchical abstention-aware

highly critical in terms of security. Examples include password checks,
signature checks, secure boot, and user privilege checks. For embedded devices,
these security-critical branches are a preferred target of fault attacks as a
single bit flip or skipping a single instruction can lead to complete access to
a system. In the past, numerous redundancy schemes have been proposed in order
to provide control-flow-integrity (CFI) and to enable error detection on
processed data. However, current countermeasures for general purpose software
do not provide protection mechanisms for conditional branches. Hence, critical
branches are in practice often simply duplicated.
  We present a generic approach to protect conditional branches, which links an
encoding-based comparison result with the redundancy of CFI protection
mechanisms. The presented approach can be used for all types of data encodings
and CFI mechanisms and maintains their error-detection capabilities throughout
all steps of a conditional branch. We demonstrate our approach by realizing an
encoded comparison based on AN-codes, which is a frequently used encoding
scheme to detect errors on data during arithmetic operations. We extended the
LLVM compiler so that standard code and conditional branches can be protected
automatically and analyze its security. Our design shows that the overhead in
terms of size and runtime is lower than state-of-the-art duplication schemes.

by means of X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, magnetic
susceptibility and resistivity measurements as a function of temperature.
Variations in critical temperature ($T_c$) between 8.6 and 9.3 K were observed,
probably due to the slightly different carbon stoichiometry of the samples.
Single-crystal X-ray refinement confirmed the high structural perfection of the
grown crystals. Remarkably, the refined Flack parameter values for all the
measured crystals using a $P4_132$ space-group model were consistently close to
either 0 or 1, hence indicating that the considered crystals belong to two
enantiomorphic space groups, $P4_132$ and $P4_332$. An anomaly in the
resistivity is observed at about 130 K, most likely associated with the onset
of a charge-density-wave phase. The superconducting properties (and in
particular the symmetry, the amplitude and the temperature dependence of the
superconducting gap) were studied by using - for the first time in this

Several studies have highlighted the fact that the training procedure, i.e.
mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) leads to solutions that have

these functions in analogy to linear interpolations (for given input data there
are finitely many triangulations, which each determine a function by linear

Their genome is segmented into two or more parts, and encapsidated in separate
particles that appear to propagate independently. Completing the replication
cycle, however, requires the full genome, so that a systemic infection of a
host requires the concurrent presence of several particles. This represents an
apparent evolutionary drawback of multipartitism, while its advantages remain
unclear. A transition from monopartite to multipartite viral forms has been
described in vitro under conditions of high multiplicity of infection,
suggesting that cooperation between defective mutants is a plausible
evolutionary pathway towards multipartitism. However, it is unknown how the
putative advantages that multipartitism might enjoy at the microscopic level
affect its epidemiology, or if an explicit advantange is needed to explain its
ecological persistence. To disentangle which mechanisms might contribute to the
rise and fixation of multipartitism, we investigate the interaction between
viral spreading dynamics and host population structure. We set up a
compartmental model of the spread of a virus in its different forms and explore
its epidemiology using both analytical and numerical techniques. We uncover
that the impact of host contact structure on spreading dynamics entails a rich
phenomenology of ecological relationships that includes cooperation,
competition, and commensality. We find that multipartitism might rise to
fixation even in the absence of explicit microscopic advantages. Multipartitism
allows the virus to colonize environments that could not be invaded by the
monopartite form, facilitated by homogeneous contacts among hosts. We
conjecture that these features might have led to an increase in the diversity
and prevalence of multipartite viral forms concomitantly with the expansion of
agricultural practices.

parameters in a parameterized hypothesis space based on finite input-output
samples. The hidden parameters determine the attributions of hidden predictors
or the nonlinear mechanism of an estimator, while the bright parameters
characterize how hidden predictors are linearly combined or the linear
mechanism. In traditional learning paradigm, hidden and bright parameters are
not distinguished and trained simultaneously in one learning process. Such an
one-stage learning (OSL) brings a benefit of theoretical analysis but suffers
from the high computational burden. To overcome this difficulty, a two-stage
learning (TSL) scheme, featured by learning through deterministic assignment of
hidden parameters (LtDaHP) was proposed, which suggests to deterministically
generate the hidden parameters by using minimal Riesz energy points on a sphere
and equally spaced points in an interval. We theoretically show that with such
deterministic assignment of hidden parameters, LtDaHP with a neural network
realization almost shares the same generalization performance with that of OSL.
We also present a series of simulations and application examples to support the
outperformance of LtDaHP

whether a Galactic wind which eventually forms a termination shock far outside
the Galactic plane can contribute as a possible source to the observed flux in
the region of interest. Previous work by Bustard et al. (2017) estimated that
particles can be accelerated up to energies above the `knee' up to
$R_\mathrm{max} = 10^{16}$ eV for parameters drawn from a model of a Milky Way
wind (Everett et al. 2017). A remaining question is whether the accelerated
cosmic rays can propagate back into the Galaxy. To answer this crucial
question, we simulate the propagation of the cosmic rays using the low energy
extension of the CRPropa framework, based on the solution of the transport
equation via stochastic differential equations. The setup includes all relevant
processes, including three-dimensional anisotropic spatial diffusion,
advection, and corresponding adiabatic cooling. We find that, assuming
realistic parameters for the shock evolution, a possible Galactic termination
shock can contribute significantly to the energy budget in the `knee' region

be below measurements from IceCube and limits by KM3NeT.

Gaussian MAC proposed by A. Vem et al in 2017. The proposed scheme consists of
four parts: (i) the data transmission is partitioned into time slots; (ii) the
data, transmitted in each slot, is split into two parts, the first one set an
interleaver of the low-density parity-check (LDPC) type code and is encoded by
spreading sequence or codewords that are designed to be decoded by compressed
sensing type decoding; (iii) the another part of transmitted data is encoded by
LDPC type code and decoded using a joint message passing decoding algorithm
designed for the T-user binary input Gaussian MAC; (iv) users repeat their
codeword in multiple slots. In this paper we are concentrated on the third part
of considered scheme. We generalized the PEXIT charts to optimize the
protograph of LDPC code for Gaussian MAC. The simulation results, obtained at
the end of the paper, were analyzed and compared with obtained theoretical
bounds and thresholds. Obtained simulation results shows that proposed LDPC
code constructions have better performance under joint decoding algorithm over
Gaussian MAC than LDPC codes considered by A. Vem et al in 2017, that leads to
the better performance of overall transmission system.

optimal value seems to be universal under several evaluation metrics across
different datasets. Moreover, results of extensive experiments on the two

Similarly, for objects of the same luminosity, the angular radius of an object
in a non-expanding universe declines with redshift, while in an expanding
universe this radius increases for redshifts z>1.25. The author and colleagues
have previously shown that data for the surface brightness of disk galaxies are
compatible with a static universe with redshift linearly proportional to
distance at all z (SEU hypothesis). In this paper we examine the more
conventional hypothesis that the universe is expanding, but that the actual
radii of galaxies of a given luminosity increase with time (decrease with z),
as others have proposed. We show that the radii data for both disk and
elliptical galaxies are incompatible with any of the published size-evolution
predictions based on an expanding universe. We find that all the physical
mechanisms proposed for size evolution, such as galaxy mergers, lead to
predictions that are in quantitative contradiction with either the radius data
or other data sets, such as the observed rate of galaxy mergers. In addition,
we find that when the effect of telescope resolution is taken into account, the
r-z relationships for disk and elliptical galaxies are identical. Both are
excellently fit by SEU predictions. An overall comparison of cosmological
models requires examining all available data-sets, but for this data-set there
is a clear contradiction of predictions based on an expanding universe
hypothesis.

reduces the number and duration of the drivers sight deviations from the road,
by projecting the required information directly into the drivers line of
vision. There are many studies about ways of presenting the information:
standard oneearpiece presentation, threedimensional audio presentation, visual
only or audiovisual presentation. Results have shown that using a 3D auditory
display the time of acquiring targets is approximately 2.2 seconds faster than
using a oneearpiece way. Nevertheless, a disadvantage is when the drivers
attention unconsciously shifts away from the road and goes focused on

role in both driving the powerful relativistic jets observed in active galactic
nuclei and extracting the rotational energy from a black hole via
Blandford-Znajek process. The magnitude of magnetic field and the magnetic flux
in the vicinity of a central black hole is predicted by theoretical models. On
the other hand, the magnetic field in a jet can be estimated through
measurements of either the core shift effect or the brightness temperature. In
both cases the obtained magnetic field is in the radiating domain, so its
direct application to the calculation of the magnetic flux needs some
theoretical assumptions. In this paper we address the issue of estimating the
magnetic flux contained in a jet using the measurements of a core shift effect
and of a brightness temperature for the jets, directed almost at the observer.
The accurate account for the jet transversal structure allow us to express the
magnetic flux through the observed values and an unknown rotation rate of
magnetic surfaces. If we assume the sources are in a magnetically arrested disk
state, the lower limit for the rotation rate can be obtained. On the other
hand, the flux estimate may be tested against the total jet power predicted by
the electromagnetic energy extraction model. The resultant expression for power
depends logarithmically weakly on an unknown rotation rate. We show that the
total jet power estimated through the magnetic flux is in good agreement with
the observed power. We also obtain the extremely slow rotation rates, which may
be an indication that the majority of the sources considered are not in the
magnetically arrested disk state.

Connected Pyramid Dehazing Network (DCPDN), which can jointly learn the
transmission map, atmospheric light and dehazing all together. The end-to-end
learning is achieved by directly embedding the atmospheric scattering model
into the network, thereby ensuring that the proposed method strictly follows
the physics-driven scattering model for dehazing. Inspired by the dense network
that can maximize the information flow along features from different levels, we
propose a new edge-preserving densely connected encoder-decoder structure with
multi-level pyramid pooling module for estimating the transmission map. This
network is optimized using a newly introduced edge-preserving loss function. To
further incorporate the mutual structural information between the estimated
transmission map and the dehazed result, we propose a joint-discriminator based
on generative adversarial network framework to decide whether the corresponding
dehazed image and the estimated transmission map are real or fake. An ablation
study is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of each module evaluated at
both estimated transmission map and dehazed result. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art methods. Code will be made available at:

clearly suppressed when $\textbf{H}_{DC}$ is applied within ab plane. More
interestingly, when the magnetic component of THz wave $\textbf{h}(t)$ is
perpendicular to the applied in-plane magnetic field, we observe another
coherent oscillation at slightly higher energy scale at the field above 2 T,
which is eventually suppressed for $H_{DC}>$5 T. The measurement seems to
indicate that the in-plane magnetic field can lift the degeneracy of two
branches of low energy magnons at $\Gamma$ point. The low energy optical

of a body, is ubiquitous in both natural and engineering systems. It is the
fundamental mechanism by which biological materials grow, starting from the
level of a single cell, and is increasingly applied in engineering processes
for fabrication and self-assembly. A significant complexity in describing the
kinetics of such processes arises due to their inherent coupled interaction
with the diffusing constituents that are needed to sustain the growth, and the
influence of local stresses on the growth rates. Moreover, changes in
concentration of solvent within the bulk of the body, generated by diffusion,
can affect volumetric changes, thus leading to an additional interacting growth
mechanism. In this paper we present a general theoretical framework that
captures these complexities to describe the kinetics of surface growth while
accounting for coupled diffusion. Then, by combination of analytical and
numerical tools, applied to a simple growth geometry, we show that the
evolution of such growth processes rapidly tends towards a universal path that
is independent of initial conditions. This path, on which surface growth
mechanisms and diffusion act harmoniously, can be extended to analytically
portray the evolution of a body from inception up to a treadmilling state, in
which addition and removal of material are balanced.

supersolvable groups belong to this class and show that nonabelian finite
simple groups do not belong to it. The second question concerns the
Cohen-Macaulayness of the invariant ring $\mathbb{Z}[x_1,\dots,x_n]^G$, where
$G$ is a permutation group. We prove that this ring is Cohen-Macaulay if $G$ is

image requantization and compression when those images must be transmitted to a

utilize the ionization and scintillation properties of the target materials to
detect radiation-induced recoils. A requirement for high light and charge
yields is to reduce electronegative impurities well below the ppb level. To
achieve this, the target material is continuously circulated in the gas phase
through a purifier and returned to the detector. Additionally, the low
backgrounds necessary dictate low-Rn-emanation rates from all components that
contact the gas.
  Since commercial pumps often introduce electronegative impurities from
lubricants on internal components or through small air leaks, and are not
designed to meet the radiopurity requirements, custom-built pumps are an
advantageous alternative. A new pump has been developed in Muenster in
cooperation with the nEXO group at Stanford University and the nEXO/XENON group

hot cores with embedded HC/UCHII regions, by coupling the astrochemical code
Saptarsy to a radiative transfer framework obtaining the spatio-temporal
evolution of abundances as well as time-dependent synthetic spectra. In these
models where we focused on the internal PDR surrounding the HI region, the gas
temperature is set to the dust temperature and we do not include dynamics thus
the density structure is fixed. We compared this to hot molecular core models
and studied the effect on the chemistry of the radiation field which is
included in the HII region models only during the computation of abundances. In
addition, we investigated the chemical evolution of the gas surrounding HII
regions with models of different densities at the ionization front, different
sizes of the ionized cavity and different initial abundances. We obtain the
time evolution of synthetic spectra for a dozen of selected species as well as
ratios of their integrated intensities. We find that some molecules such as C,
N2H+, CN, and HCO do not trace the inner core and so are not good tracers to
distinguish the HII/PDR regions to the HMCs phase. On the contrary, C+ and O
trace the internal PDRs, in the two models starting with different initial
abundances, but are unfortunately currently unobservable with the current
achievable spatial resolution because of the very thin internal PDR (r < 100
AU). In addition, we find that the abundance profiles are highly affected by
the choice of the initial abundances, hence the importance to properly define
them.

theory we model the gradient of the forces as a function of the instantaneous
shape of the swimmer and its velocity. By virtue of the low inertia conditions,
an expression for the translational and rotational velocity of the head is
obtained for the planar motion in the form of a Lie algebra of the Special

result for a type of slender flexible swimmer where the shape space is the
space of all continuous curves of a given length. A set of simulation results

criminals penetrate illegally into an OSN by establishing fake profiles or by
designing bots and exploit the vulnerabilities of an OSN to carry out illegal
activities. With the growth of technology cyber crimes have been increasing
manifold. Daily reports of the security and privacy threats in the OSNs demand
not only the intelligent automated detection systems that can identify and
alleviate fake profiles in real time but also the reinforcement of the security

various categories of fake profiles like compromised profiles, cloned profiles
and online bots (spam-bots, social-bots, like-bots and influential-bots) on
different OSN sites along with existing cyber laws to mitigate their threats.
In order to design fake profile detection systems, we have highlighted

different kinds of fake entities from real ones. Another major challenges faced

unavailability of data specific to fake users. The paper addresses this

with the accuracy of a few percent. Such accuracy will allow for precise
comparisons of measurements to models of compact objects. Here we investigate
how the measurement accuracy of the NICER and ATHENA missions will improve our
understanding of the dense-matter interior of neutron stars. We compare global
parameters of stellar configurations obtained using three different equations
of state: a reference (SLy4 EOS) and two piecewise polytropes manufactured to
produce mass-radius relations indistinguishable from the observational point of
view i.e. within the predicted error of the radius measurement. We assume
observational errors on the radius determination corresponding to the expected
accuracies. The effect of rotation is examined using high-precision numerical
relativity computations. Due to the fact that masses and rotational frequencies
might be determined very precisely in the most optimistic scenario, only the
influence of observational errors on the radius measurements is investigated.
We show that ${\pm}5\%$ errors in radius measurement lead to ${\sim}10\%$ and
${\sim}40\%$ accuracy in central parameter estimation, for low-mass and
high-mass neutron stars, respectively. Global parameters, such as oblateness
and surface area, can be established with $8-10\%$ accuracy, even if only
compactness (instead of mass and radius) is measured. We also report on the
range of tidal deformabilities corresponding to the estimated masses of
GW170817, for the assumed uncertainty in radius.

a group of truth functions form a semantic channel. By the third kind of Bayes'
theorem, we can directly convert a Shannon's channel into an optimized semantic
channel. When a sample is not big enough, we can use a truth function with
parameters to produce the likelihood function, then train the truth function by
the conditional sampling distribution. The third kind of Bayes' theorem is
proved. A semantic information theory is simply introduced. The semantic
information measure reflects Popper's hypothesis-testing thought. The Semantic
Information Method (SIM) adheres to maximum semantic information criterion
which is compatible with maximum likelihood criterion and Regularized Least
Squares criterion. It supports Wittgenstein's view: the meaning of a word lies
in its use. Letting the two channels mutually match, we obtain the Channels'
Matching (CM) algorithm for machine learning. The CM algorithm is used to
explain the evolution of the semantic meaning of natural language, such as ""Old
age"". The semantic channel for medical tests and the confirmation measures of
test-positive and test-negative are discussed. The applications of the CM
algorithm to semi-supervised learning and non-supervised learning are simply
introduced. As a predictive model, the semantic channel fits variable sources
and hence can overcome class-imbalance problem. The SIM strictly distinguishes
statistical probability and logical probability and uses both at the same time.
This method is compatible with the thoughts of Bayes, Fisher, Shannon, Zadeh,
Tarski, Davidson, Wittgenstein, and Popper.It is a competitive alternative to
Bayesian inference.

mitigate this risk, first by defining an autonomous decision-making process
based on an adaptive traffic light system (ATLS) to stop risky injections, and
second by quantifying a ""cost of public safety"" based on the probability of an
injection-well being abandoned. The ATLS underlying statistical model is first
confirmed to be representative of injection-induced seismicity, with examples
taken from past reservoir stimulation experiments (mostly from Enhanced
Geothermal Systems, EGS). Then the decision strategy is formalized: Being
integrable, the model yields a closed-form ATLS solution that maps a risk-based
safety standard or norm to an earthquake magnitude not to exceed during
stimulation. Finally, the EGS levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is
reformulated in terms of null expectation, with the cost of abandoned
injection-well implemented. We find that the price increase to mitigate the
increased seismic risk in populated areas can counterbalance the heat credit.
However this ""public safety cost"" disappears if buildings are based on
earthquake-resistant designs or if a more relaxed risk safety standard or norm
is chosen.

the Drone BSs (DBSs) and GBSs involved in the healing process which accordingly
will minimize the number of DBSs and determine their optimal 2D positions. In

expected ranges does not noticeably affect the modeled abundances indicating
that the chemical make-up of hot cores is determined in the warm-up stage.
Complex cyanides vinyl and ethyl cyanide (CH$_2$CHCN and C$_2$H$_5$CN,
respectively) cannot be produced in abundances (versus H$_2$) greater than
5x10$^{-10}$ for CH$_2$CHCN and 2x10$^{-10}$ for C$_2$H$_5$CN with a fast

reduced at higher initial temperatures and increased at higher cosmic-ray
ionization rates. Reproducing the observed abundances toward G35.20-0.74 Core
B3 requires a fast warm-up at a high cosmic-ray ionization rate (1x10$^{-16}$

seismic measurements that have a high sensitivity to the physical conditions at
a desired target point in the solar interior. With this technique, pairs of
points on the solar surface are chosen such that acoustic ray paths intersect
at this target (focus) point. Considering acoustic waves in a homogeneous
medium, we compare travel-time and amplitude measurements extracted from the
deep-focusing cross-covariance functions. Using a single-scattering
approximation, we find that the spatial sensitivity of deep-focusing travel
times to sound-speed perturbations is zero at the target location and maximum
in a surrounding shell. This is unlike the deep-focusing amplitude
measurements, which have maximum sensitivity at the target point. We compare
the signal-to-noise ratio for travel-time and amplitude measurements for
different types of sound-speed perturbations, under the assumption that noise
is solely due to the random excitation of the waves. We find that, for highly
localized perturbations in sound speed, the signal-to-noise ratio is higher for
amplitude measurements than for travel-time measurements. We conclude that
amplitude measurements are a useful complement to travel-time measurements in
time--distance helioseismology.

characteristic of distant objects must appear to scale by the factor $(1+z$).
This is called time dilation. Light curves of type Ia supernovae and the
duration of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB) are the only observations that can directly
measure time dilation over a wide range of redshifts. An analysis of raw
observations of 2,333 type Ia supernovae light-curves shows that their widths,
relative to a standard template, have a power-law exponent as a function of
${(1+z)}$, of (0.083 +/- 0.024) which is consistent with no time dilation and
inconsistent with standard time dilation. In addition, it is shown that the
standard method for calibrating the type Ia supernovae light curves (SALT2) is
flawed, which explains why this lack of time dilation has not been previously
observed. \par Nearby observations show that the peak absolute magnitude of
type Ia supernovae is also constant. Here it is shown that the peak absolute
