$^{6}$Li-loaded liquid scintillator detector that was designed and operated as
prototype for the PROSPECT (Precision Reactor Oscillation and Spectrum)
Experiment. The two-segment detector was constructed according to the design
specifications of the experiment. It features low-mass optical separators, an
integrated source and optical calibration system, and materials that are
compatible with the $^{6}$Li-doped scintillator developed by PROSPECT. We
demonstrate a high light collection of 850$\pm$20 PE/MeV, an energy resolution
of $\sigma$ = 4.0$\pm$0.2% at 1 MeV, and efficient pulse-shape discrimination
of low $dE/dx$ (electronic recoil) and high $dE/dx$ (nuclear recoil) energy
depositions. An effective scintillation attenuation length of 85$\pm$3 cm is
measured in each segment. The 0.1% by mass concentration of $^{6}$Li in the
scintillator results in a measured neutron capture time of $\tau$ =
42.8$\pm$0.2 $\mu s$. The long-term stability of the scintillator is also
discussed. The detector response meets the criteria necessary for achieving the
PROSPECT physics goals and demonstrates features that may find application in
fast neutron detection.

magnetization and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. The temperature
dependence of magnetization measured in both zero-field-cooled and field-cooled

about 67%, while the fraction for another phase with Tc of 113K is quite small.
The XRD Rietveld refinement for S1 indicates two main phases existing in the

function of the centre-of-mass separation distance, \lambda. We examined the
scaling of the free energy functions with the polymer length, the length and
diameter of the confining cylinder, the polymer topology (i.e. linear vs ring
polymers), and the packing fraction and size of mobile crowding agents. In the
absence of crowders, the observed scaling of F(\lambda) is similar to that
predicted using a simple model employing the de~Gennes blob model and the
approximation that the free energy of overlapping chains in a tube is equal to
that of two isolated chains each in a tube of half the cross-sectional area.
Simulations were used to test the latter approximation and reveal that it
yields poor quantitative predictions. This, along with generic finite-size
effects, likely gives rise to the discrepancies between the predicted and
measured values of scaling exponents for F(\lambda). For segregation in the
presence of crowding agents, the free energy barrier generally decreases with
increasing crowder packing fraction, thus reducing the entropic forces driving
segregation. However, for fixed packing fraction, the barrier increases as the

soundness of the code's measurement checks. Good code soundness in topological

soundness. In other words, every code can perform single-shot error correction
but the required checks may be nonlocal and act on many qubits. If we desire
codes with both good soundness and simple measurement checks (the LDPC
property) then careful constructions are needed. Finally, we use a double
application of the homological product to construct quantum LDPC codes with
single-shot error correcting capabilities. Our double homological product codes

a uniform and spherically symmetric ambient medium, with an isothermal equation
of state. A thick-shell solution is developed which captures the stalling of
the ionization front and the decay of the leading shock to a weak compression
wave as it escapes to large radii. An acoustic approximation is introduced to
capture the late-time damped oscillations of the H II region about the
stagnation radius. Putting these together, a matched asymptotic equation is
derived for the radius of the ionization front which accounts for both the
inertia of the expanding shell and the finite temperature of the ambient
medium. The solution to this equation is shown to agree very well with the
numerical solution at all times, and is superior to all previously published
solutions. The matched asymptotic solution can also accurately model the
variation of H II region radius for a time-varying radiation source.

  Both proofs proceed by studying the action of the pointed mapping class group
$\mathrm{MCG}_*(\Sigma)$ on the set of homomorphisms $\{\pi_1(\Sigma) \to G\}$
for an appropriate surface $\Sigma$. In the case where $X=M$ is closed, we take
$\Sigma$ to be a closed surface with large genus. When $X=S^3 \setminus K$ is a
knot complement, we take $\Sigma$ to be a disk with many punctures. Our
constructions exhibit classical computational universality for a combinatorial
topological quantum field theory associated to $G$. Our ""topological classical
computing"" theorems are analogs of the famous results of Freedman, Larsen and
Wang establishing the quantum universality of topological quantum computing
with the Jones polynomial at a root of unity. Instead of using quantum
circuits, we develop a circuit model for classical reversible computing that is
equivariant with respect to a symmetry of the computational alphabet.

exhibit a power law, it remains unclear how electrons are accelerated to high
energies and what processes determine the power-law index $\delta$. Here, we
review previous observations of the power-law index $\delta$ in a variety of
different plasma environments with a particular focus on sub-relativistic
electrons. It appears that in regions more closely related to magnetic
reconnection (such as the `above-the-looptop' solar hard X-ray source and the
plasma sheet in Earth's magnetotail), the spectra are typically soft ($\delta
\gtrsim$ 4). This is in contrast to the typically hard spectra ($\delta
\lesssim$ 4) that are observed in coincidence with shocks. The difference
implies that shocks are more efficient in producing a larger non-thermal
fraction of electron energies when compared to magnetic reconnection. A caveat
is that during active times in Earth's magnetotail, $\delta$ values seem
spatially uniform in the plasma sheet, while power-law distributions still
exist even in quiet times. The role of magnetotail reconnection in the electron
power-law formation could therefore be confounded with these background
conditions. Because different regions have been studied with different
instrumentations and methodologies, we point out a need for more systematic and
coordinated studies of power-law distributions for a better understanding of
possible scaling laws in particle acceleration as well as their universality.

rigidity in one-dimensional dynamics: interval or circle maps that are
topologically conjugate are quasisymmetrically conjugate (provided some obvious
necessary assumptions are satisfied). The aim of this paper is to conclude this
programme in a natural class of $C^3$ mappings. Examples of such rigidity were
established previously, but not, for example, for real polynomials with
non-real critical points.
  Our results are also new for analytic mappings. The main new ingredients of
the proof in the real analytic case are (i) the existence of infinitely many
(complex) domains associated to its complex analytic extension so that these
domains and their ranges are compatible, (ii) a methodology for showing that
combinatorially equivalent complex box mappings are qc conjugate, (iii) a
methodology for constructing qc conjugacies in the presence of parabolic
periodic points.
  For a $C^3$ mapping, the dilatation of a high iterate of any complex
extension of the real map will in general be unbounded. To deal with this, we
introduce dynamically defined $qc\backslash bg$ $partitions$, where the
appropriate mapping has bounded quasiconformal dilatation, except on sets with
""bounded geometry"". To obtain such a partition we prove that we have very good
geometric control for infinitely many dynamically defined domains. Some of
these results are new even for real polynomials, and in fact an important
sequence of domains turn out to be quasidiscs. This technology also gives a new
method for dealing with the infinitely renormalizable case.
  We will briefly also discuss why quasisymmetric rigidity is such a useful
property in one-dimensional dynamics.

during the formation of Pluto. We use New Horizons data and models to estimate
the amounts of N2 in the following exterior reservoirs: atmosphere, escape,
photochemistry, and surface. The total exterior inventory is deduced to be
dominated by a glacial sheet of N2-rich ices at Sputnik Planitia, or by
atmospheric escape if past rates of escape were much faster than at present.
Pluto's atmosphere is a negligible reservoir of N2, and photochemical
destruction of N2 may also be of little consequence. Estimates are made of the
amount of N2 accreted by Pluto based on cometary and solar compositions. It is
found that the cometary model can account for the amount of N2 in Sputnik
Planitia, while the solar model can provide a large initial inventory of N2
that would make prodigious atmospheric escape possible. These consistencies can
be considered preliminary evidence in support of a primordial origin of Pluto's
N2. However, both models predict accreted ratios of CO/N2 that are much higher
than that in Pluto's atmosphere. Possible processes to explain ""missing CO""
that are given quantitative support here are fractional crystallization from
the atmosphere resulting in CO burial at the surface, and aqueous destruction
reactions of CO subject to metastable thermodynamic equilibrium in the
subsurface. The plausibility of primordial N2 as the primary source of Pluto's
nitrogen (vs. NH3 or organic N) can be tested more rigorously using future
constraints on the 14N/15N ratio in N2 and the 36Ar/N2 ratio.

fractions induced by long-time thermal annealing. We find that the grain
boundary phase behaves like a metallic glass under constraint from the abutting

plasticity can be classified into three regimes: (1) For low crystalline volume
fractions, the system resembles a glass-crystal composite and plastic flow is
localised in the amorphous phase; (2) with increasing crystalline volume
fraction, clusters of crystallites become jammed and the mechanical response
depends critically on the relaxation state of the glassy grain boundaries; (3)
at grain sizes $\geq$ 10 nm, the system is jammed completely, prohibiting pure
grain-boundary plasticity and instead leading to co-deformation. We observe an
inverse Hall-Petch effect only in the second regime when the grain boundary is
not deeply relaxed. Experimental results with different grain boundary states

minimization, and propose a minimum hyperspherical energy (MHE) objective as

in instance level visual recognition tasks. Instead of processing every pixel
in an image pyramid, SNIPER processes context regions around ground-truth
instances (referred to as chips) at the appropriate scale. For background
sampling, these context-regions are generated using proposals extracted from a
region proposal network trained with a short learning schedule. Hence, the
number of chips generated per image during training adaptively changes based on
the scene complexity. SNIPER only processes 30% more pixels compared to the
commonly used single scale training at 800x1333 pixels on the COCO dataset.
But, it also observes samples from extreme resolutions of the image pyramid,
like 1400x2000 pixels. As SNIPER operates on resampled low resolution chips
(512x512 pixels), it can have a batch size as large as 20 on a single GPU even
with a ResNet-101 backbone. Therefore it can benefit from batch-normalization
during training without the need for synchronizing batch-normalization
statistics across GPUs. SNIPER brings training of instance level recognition
tasks like object detection closer to the protocol for image classification and
suggests that the commonly accepted guideline that it is important to train on
high resolution images for instance level visual recognition tasks might not be
correct. Our implementation based on Faster-RCNN with a ResNet-101 backbone
obtains an mAP of 47.6% on the COCO dataset for bounding box detection and can
process 5 images per second during inference with a single GPU. Code is

systematically derived inverting Pohlmeyer reduction and classified with
respect to their Pohlmeyer counterparts. These solutions include the spiky
strings and other well-known solutions, such as the BMN particle, the GKP
string or the giant magnons, which arise as special limits, and reveal many
interesting features of the AdS/CFT correspondence. A mapping of the physical
properties of the string solutions to those of their Pohlmeyer counterparts is
established. An interesting element of this mapping is the correspondence of
the number of spikes of the string to the topological charge in the sine-Gordon
theory. In the context of the sine-Gordon/Thirring duality, the latter is
mapped to the Thirring model fermion number, leading to a natural
classification of the solutions to fermionic objects and bosonic condensates.
Finally, the convenient parametrization of the solutions, enforced by the
inversion of the Pohlmeyer reduction, facilitates the study of the string
dispersion relation. This leads to the identification of an infinite set of
trajectories in the moduli space of solutions, where the dispersion relation
can be expressed in a closed form by means of some algebraic operations,

P\'{e}clet number and $\phi_s$ is the volume fraction of the smaller particles.
This threshold of ${\rm Pe}_s\phi_s$ for ``small-on-top'' is larger by a factor
of $\sim\alpha^2$ than the prediction of the model treating solvent as an
implicit viscous background, where $\alpha$ is the size ratio between the large
and small particles. Our simulations further show that when the evaporation
rate of the solvent is reduced, the ``small-on-top'' stratification can be
enhanced, which is not predicted by existing theories. This unexpected behavior
is explained with thermophoresis associated with a positive gradient of solvent
density caused by evaporative cooling at the liquid-vapor interface. For
ultrafast evaporation the gradient is large and drives the nanoparticles toward
the liquid/vapor interface. This phoretic effect is stronger for larger
nanoparticles and consequently the ``small-on-top'' stratification becomes more
distinct when the evaporation rate is slower (but not too slow such that a
uniform distribution of nanoparticles in the drying film is produced), as
thermophoresis that favors larger particles on the top is mitigated. A similar
effect can lead to ``large-on-top'' stratification for ${\rm Pe}_s\phi_s$ above
the threshold when ${\rm Pe}_s$ is large but $\phi_s$ is small. Our results
reveal the importance of including the solvent explicitly when modeling
evaporation-induced particle separation and organization and point to the
important role of density gradients brought about by ultrafast evaporation.

technique that corrects errors in depth caused by MPI that requires no camera
modifications, and corrects depth in just 10 milliseconds per frame. By
observing that most MPI information can be expressed as a function of the
captured depth, we pose MPI removal as a convolutional approach, and model it
using a convolutional neural network. In particular, given that the input and
output data present similar structure, we base our network in an autoencoder,
which we train in two stages: first, we use the encoder (convolution filters)
to learn a suitable basis to represent corrupted range images; then, we train
the decoder (deconvolution filters) to correct depth from the learned basis
from synthetically generated scenes. This approach allows us to tackle the lack
of reference data, by using a large-scale captured training set with corrupted
depth to train the encoder, and a smaller synthetic training set with ground
truth depth to train the corrector stage of the network, which we generate by
using a physically-based, time-resolved rendering. We demonstrate and validate
our method on both synthetic and real complex scenarios, using an off-the-shelf
ToF camera, and with only the captured incorrect depth as input.

then slows down around the scrambling time $\sim\log N$ and finally saturates
to a steady state in a manner similar to the logistic function. The deviation
to the logistic function is due to the large fluctuations (order $N$) in the
intermediate time. Moreover, we find that the exponential growth rate (quantum
Lyapunov exponent) is smaller for initial operator with $\langle h\rangle\gg

temperature can be produced by an initial operator whose height distribution is
biased towards higher operators. We numerically test the power law initial

space time theory provides a natural way to exit from the inflation
compactification epoch since the scalar field that drives the vacuum energy can
smoothly climb into small positive values of vacuum energy, which is the end of
the inflation compactification. A semi analytic solution for a step function
potential is also studied, where all of these effects are shown. Especially the
jump of the vacuum energy affect only on the derivative of dynamical space time
vector field, and not the volume or it's derivatives, which match smoothly.

problematic for the relaxion mechanism because either the relaxion does not
stabilise at all or it stabilises at vacua which cannot reproduce the observed

place shortly one after the other in a double TDE. In this case, the two debris
streams may collide with each other before falling back to the black hole
resulting in an electromagnetic emission that is absent from single TDEs. We
analytically evaluate the conditions for this streams collision to occur. It
requires that the difference in pericenter location between the two disruptions
makes up for the time delay between them. In addition, the width of the streams
must compensate for the vertical offset induced by the inclination of their
orbital planes. If the double TDE happens following the tidal separation of a

ensues lasting a few days with a luminosity $\sim 10^{43}\, \rm erg\, s^{-1}$,

theoretical and phenomenological consequences of setting the jet veto scale to
the transverse momentum $(p_T)$ of the leading charged lepton $\ell$ in
multi-lepton processes on an event-by-event basis. We consider the case of a
TeV-scale heavy neutrino $N$ decaying to the trilepton final state and find the
following: (i) Perturbative uncertainties associated with the veto greatly
reduce due to tying the veto scale to the hard process scale. (ii) The signal
efficiency for passing the veto jumps to $\gtrsim95\%$ and exhibits
little-to-no dependence on the neutrino mass scale. (iii) Top quark and `fake'
lepton rejection capabilities also improve compared to only vetoing heavy
flavor-tagged jets above a fixed $p_T$. This results in an increased
sensitivity to active-sterile neutrino mixing by approximately an order of

a variational algorithm recover these settings and hence learn Grover's
algorithm? We studied several constrained variations of this problem and
answered this question in the affirmative, with some caveats. Grover's quantum
search algorithm is optimal up to a constant. The success probability of
Grover's algorithm goes from unity for two-qubits, decreases for three- and
four-qubits and returns near unity for five-qubits then oscillates
ever-so-close to unity, reaching unity in the infinite qubit limit. The
variationally approach employed here found an experimentally discernible
improvement of $5.77\%$ and $3.95\%$ for three- and four-qubits respectively.
Our findings are interesting as an extreme example of variational search, and
illustrate the promise of using hybrid quantum classical approaches to improve

an optimal solution. This result looks promising and points out that there is a

attention because of the detection of gravitational-radiation-induced mergers.
The creation of close, compact-object binaries involves physical processes that
are not yet well understood; there are open questions about the manner in which
two compact objects come to be close enough to merge within a Hubble time. Here
we explore an important, and likely common physical process: mass transfer from
a third star in a wider, hierarchical orbit. Mass added to the close binary's
components can reduce the time to merger and can even change the nature of an
accretor, transforming a white dwarf to a neutron star and/or a neutron star to
a black hole. Some accreting white dwarfs in close binaries may even explode as
Type Ia supernovae. Given the ubiquity of higher-order multiples, the
evolutionary channels we lay out may be important pathways to gravitational
mergers, including Type Ia supernovae. Fortunately, these pathways also lead to
testable predictions.

we show for spherically-symmetric spacetimes that the area of the largest HRT

gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), are powerful sources of electromagnetic radiation.
Their emission is powered by some energy dissipation and particle acceleration
mechanism operating in-situ at large distances from the black hole. We propose
that the formation of the dissipative structures in the jet is controlled by
the time variability of the accretion disc. We argue that the open magnetic
field lines through the black hole, which drive a strongly magnetized jet, may
have their polarity reversing over time-scales related to the growth of the
magneto-rotational dynamo in the disc. Consequently, the jet is characterized
by an alternating toroidal field polarity along its propagation axis, i.e., it
is a ""striped jet"". Magnetic reconnection in the current sheets that form
between the stripes dissipates the alternating-field energy and thus powers
further jet acceleration. Here, we consider a jet with a broad distribution of
stripe widths $l>l_{\rm min}$, above a dominant scale $l_{\rm min}$. We find
that the bulk acceleration of the jet, driven by the annihilation of the
stripes, is very gradual. The dissipation rate peaks at a distance $z_{\rm
peak}\sim 10^6 R_g\, (\Gamma_\infty/30)^2\, (l_{\rm min}/1000R_g)$, where
$R_{g}$ is the black-hole's gravititional radius and $\Gamma_{\infty}$ the
jet's asymptotic Lorentz factor, and exhibits a very broad plateau extending by
$\sim 4-5$ orders of magnitude in distance. The prolonged energy dissipation
accounts for the flat-to-inverted long-wavelength spectra commonly observed in
jets. The model can also account for the broad range of flaring timescales of
blazars and the fact that their bulk acceleration appears to continue out to
~100 pc scales. In GRB jets, the model predicts comparable power for the
photopsheric and Thomson-thin emission components.

Ascribing this correlated flux density to the core, and with the use of a
contemporaneous short-baseline flux density from a Submillimeter Array
observation, we infer a core brightness temperature of $1.4 \times 10^{11}$ K.
This is close to the equipartition brightness temperature, where the magnetic

tunable, exhibiting a wide variety of different regimes, including
nondispersing flat bands and linear crossings within the bulk bandgap. The
ballistic wavelike character of these states resembles the properties of
topologically protected states; however, it requires neither topological
restrictions nor additional crystal symmetries. The Dirac surface states are
weakly sensitive to surface disorder and can dominate edge transport at the

interstellar medium via multiple paths, which interfere with each other. It has
long been realized that the scattering screens responsible for the
scintillation could be used as `interstellar lenses' to localize pulsar
emission regions. Most scattering screens, however, only marginally resolve
emission components, limiting results to statistical inferences and detections
of small positional shifts. Since screens situated close to the source have
better resolution, it should be easier to resolve emission regions of pulsars
located in high density environments such as supernova remnants or binaries in
which the pulsar's companion has an ionized outflow. Here, we report events of
extreme plasma lensing in the `Black Widow' pulsar, PSR~B1957+20, near the
phase in its 9.2 hour orbit in which its emission is eclipsed by its
companion's outflow. During the lensing events, the flux is enhanced by factors
of up to 70--80 at specific frequencies. The strongest events clearly resolve
the emission regions: they affect the narrow main pulse and parts of the wider
interpulse differently. We show that the events arise naturally from density
fluctuations in the outer regions of the outflow, and infer a resolution of our
lenses comparable to the pulsar's radius, about 10\,km. Furthermore, the
distinct frequency structures imparted by the lensing are reminiscent of what
is observed for the repeating fast radio burst FRB 121102, providing
observational support for the idea that this source is observed through, and
thus at times strongly magnified by, plasma lenses.

be a powerful probe of the black hole mass in AGNs. We identify key emission
line ratios in the 1-30 \mu m range that are most sensitive to black hole mass.
While variations in accretion rate and the physical parameters of the gas can
also affect the CL spectrum, we demonstrate that the effect of black hole mass

find best-fit IAU phase function parameters of H_R=19.5+/-0.2 mag and
G_R=-0.22+/-0.13 for the nucleus, corresponding to an effective radius of
r_N=0.32+/-0.03 km (assuming an albedo of p_R=0.05). The object appears
significantly brighter (by >1 mag) than expected starting in 2017 November,
while a faint dust tail oriented approximately in the antisolar direction is
also observed on 2017 December 18. We conclude that 358P has become active
again for the first time since its previously observed active period in
2012-2013. These observations make 358P the seventh main-belt comet candidate
confirmed to exhibit recurrent activity near perihelion with intervening
inactivity away from perihelion, strongly indicating that its activity is
sublimation-driven. Fitting a linear function to the ejected dust masses
inferred for 358P in 2017 when it is apparently active, we find an average net
dust production rate of 2.0+/-0.6 kg/s (assuming a mean effective particle
radius of 1 mm) and an estimated activity start date of 2017 November 8+/-4
when the object was at a true anomaly of 316+/-1 deg and a heliocentric
distance of R=2.54 AU. Insufficient data is currently available to ascertain
whether activity strength has changed between the object's 2012-2013 and 2017
active periods. Further observations are therefore highly encouraged during the
object's upcoming observing window (2018 August through 2019 May).

with the number of memories, something prohibitive for larger problems. To
solve these issues, we introduce the Working Memory Network, a MemNN
architecture with a novel working memory storage and reasoning module. Our
model retains the relational reasoning abilities of the RN while reducing its
computational complexity from quadratic to linear. We tested our model on the

This provides a semi-independent proof of their classifications and extends the
study of canonical orders in [CHI09] to the case of log terminal orders. A
secondary goal of this paper is to study noncommutative analogues of plane

magnetostriction. The latter induces an in-plane magnetostrain of the hexagonal
unit cell at ambient pressure and flips to an out-of-plane strain at high
pressures in accordance with the change of the magnetic structure.

We find analogs of observed systems in cosmological n-body simulations and
quantify their likelihood of matching the observed projected separation and
relative radial velocities between subclusters, as a function of viewing angle.
We derive constraints on the viewing angle of many observed bimodal mergers
including the Bullet Cluster (1E 0657-558) and El Gordo (ACT-CL J0102-4915). We
also present more generic constraints as a function of projected separation and
relative radial velocity, which can be used to assess additional clusters as
information about them becomes available. The constraints from these two
observables alone are weak (typically $\gtrsim 70-75^\circ$ at 68\% confidence
and $\gtrsim 55-60^\circ$ at 95\% confidence) but incorporate much more
cosmological context than the classical timing argument, marginalizing over
many realizations of substructure, peculiar velocities, and so on. Compared to
the MCMAC code, which implements the timing argument on NFW halos, our
constraints generally predict subcluster separation vectors closer to the plane
of the sky. This is because in realistic mergers the subcluster velocity
vectors are not entirely parallel to the separation vector (i.e, the mergers
are not perfectly head-on). As a result, observation of a nonzero relative
radial velocity does not exclude a separation vector in the plane of the sky,
as it does in the head-on timing argument employed by MCMAC.

very important. Objects at different states would require different grasping.
To achieve different states, different manipulations would be required, as well

cooking objects was created. Cooking consists of various cutting techniques
needed for different dishes (e.g. diced, julienne etc.). Identifying each of
this state of cooking objects by the human can be difficult sometimes too. In
this paper, we have analyzed seven different cooking object states by tuning a
convolutional neural network (CNN). For this task, images were downloaded and
annotated by students and they are divided into training and a completely
different test set. By tuning the vgg-16 CNN 77% accuracy was obtained. The
work presented in this paper focuses on classification between various object
states rather than task recognition or recipe prediction. This framework can be
easily adapted in any other object state classification activity.

Taking both the phases as leaky dielectric and perfect dielectric in to
consideration, we have performed 2D numerical solution for capturing the
essential features of droplet deformation in between the parallel plate
configuration. For a perfect dielectric system, this study shows that the
deformation characteristic follows a monotonic as well as non-monotonic
variation with domain confinement depending on the values of electrical
permittivity ratio of the droplet and the surrounding fluid. For a
leaky-dielectric system, presence of small conductivity further alters the
deformation characteristic and it is happened that, at low electric field
strength, the deformation increases with confinement monotonically. On
contrary, deformation parameter shows non-monotonic variation with the domain
confinement at higher electric field strength. Furthermore, in confined domain,
the transient evolution of the deformation parameter is also markedly altered
by the electric field strength in terms of steady state value of the
deformation parameter and steady state time. Finally, the present analysis
shows that the domain confinement significantly augment the deformation
parameter in presence of electric field that leads to possible droplet break up
phenomenon. From the present study, it is worthy to mention that domain
confinement can be used to modulate the droplet morphology that has potential
applications in modern-days droplet-based micro-fluidic devices.

results in a portion of the collected signal incident on one pixel of a
hybridized detector array being measured in adjacent pixels. Data collected by
light sensitive HgCdTe arrays which exhibit this coupling typically goes
uncorrected or is corrected by treating the coupling as a fixed point spread
function. Evidence suggests that this IPC coupling is not uniform across
different signal and background levels. This variation invalidates assumptions
that are key in decoupling techniques such as Wiener Filtering or application
of the Lucy- Richardson algorithm. Additionally, the variable IPC results in
the point spread function (PSF) depending upon a star's signal level relative
to the background level, amond other parameters. With an IPC ranging from 0.68%
to 1.45% over the full well depth of a sensor, as is a reasonable range for the
H2RG arrays, the FWHM of the JWSTs NIRCam 405N band is degraded from 2.080 pix
(0"".132) as expected from the diffraction patter to 2.186 pix (0"".142) when the
star is just breaching the sensitivity limit of the system. For example, when
attempting to use a fixed PSF fitting (e.g. assuming the PSF observed from a
bright star in the field) to untangle two sources with a flux ratio of 4:1 and
a center to center distance of 3 pixels, flux estimation can be off by upwards
of 1.5% with a separation error of 50 millipixels. To deal with this issue an
iterative non-stationary method for deconvolution is here proposed,

dynamics (ASGLD) algorithmic framework and its two specialized versions, namely
adaptive stochastic gradient (ASG) and adaptive gradient Langevin
dynamics(AGLD), for non-convex optimization problems. All proposed algorithms
can escape from saddle points with at most $O(\log d)$ iterations, which is
nearly dimension-free. Further, we show that ASGLD and ASG converge to a local
minimum with at most $O(\log d/\epsilon^4)$ iterations. Also, ASGLD with full
gradients or ASGLD with a slowly linearly increasing batch size converge to a
local minimum with iterations bounded by $O(\log d/\epsilon^2)$, which
outperforms existing first-order methods.

basis functions with the capability of capturing multiscale features and
non-local effects. We will construct multiscale basis functions for the coarse
regions and additional multiscale basis functions for perforations, with the
aim of handling non-homogeneous boundary conditions on perforations. We start
with describing our method for the Laplace equation, and then extending the
framework for the elasticity problem and parabolic equations. The resulting
upscaled model has minimal size and the solution has physical meaning on the
coarse grid. We will present numerical results (1) for steady and unsteady
problems, (2) for Laplace and Elastic operators, and (3) for Neumann and Robin
non-homogeneous boundary conditions on perforations. Numerical results show
that the proposed method can provide good accuracy and provide significant

conformally transforming known `seed' solutions. It is shown that these new

theory. Furthermore, when interpreted as effective Einstein equations,those
field equations exhibit, in the case of a cosmological `background', an induced
imperfect fluid as an additional effective source besides the original sources
of the `seed' solutions. As an application, the charged non-rotating Thakurta
black hole conformal to Reissner-Nordstrom is used to demonstrate the fragility
of the inner Cauchy horizon when this black hole is embedded in the universe
(even accounting for the separation of black hole and Hubble scales).
Similarly, the charged McVittie spacetime representing a charged black hole
embedded in a cosmological `background' with varying Hubble parameter does not
exhibit a real Cauchy horizon. These arguments speak in favor of restoring
determinism to Einstein theory, which was questioned in recent research.

standard hash table implementations do not translate well into the external
memory model, because they do not incorporate locality for insertions.
  Iacono and Patracsu established an update/query tradeoff curve for external
hash tables: a hash table that performs insertions in $O(\lambda/B)$ amortized
IOs requires $\Omega(\log_\lambda N)$ expected IOs for queries, where $N$ is
the number of items that can be stored in the data structure, $B$ is the size
of a memory transfer, $M$ is the size of memory, and $\lambda$ is a tuning
parameter.
  They provide a hashing data structure that meets this curve for $\lambda$
that is $\Omega(\log\log M + \log_M N)$. Their data structure, which we call an
\defn{IP hash table}, is complicated and, to the best of our knowledge, has not
been implemented.
  In this paper, we present a new and much simpler optimal external memory hash
table, the \defn{Bundle of Arrays Hash Table} (BOA). BOAs are based on
size-tiered LSMs, a well-studied data structure, and are almost as easy to
implement. The BOA is optimal for a narrower range of $\lambda$. However, the
simplicity of BOAs allows them to be readily modified to achieve the following
results:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A new external memory data structure, the \defn{Bundle of Trees Hash
Table} (BOT), that matches the performance of the IP hash table, while
retaining some of the simplicity of the BOAs.
  \item The \defn{cache-oblivious Bundle of Trees Hash Table} (COBOT), the

of the intrinsic bi-energy functional, therefore intrinsic bi-harmonic map and
its heat flow are more geometrically natural to study, but they are also
considerably more difficult analytically than the extrinsic counterparts due to
the lack of coercivity for the intrinsic bi-energy. In this paper, we show an
energy convexity and thus uniqueness for weakly intrinsic bi-harmonic maps from
the unit $4$-ball $B_1 \subset \mathbf{R}^4$ into the sphere $\mathbf{S}^n$.
This is a higher-order analogue of the energy convexity and uniqueness for
weakly harmonic maps on unit $2$-disk in $\mathbf{R}^2$ proved by Colding and
Minicozzi \cite{CM08} (see also Lamm and the second author \cite{LL13}). In
particular, this yields a version of uniqueness of weakly harmonic maps on the

convexity along the intrinsic bi-harmonic map heat flow into $\mathbf{S}^n$,
which in particular yields the long-time existence of the intrinsic bi-harmonic
map heat flow, a result that was until now only known assuming the
non-positivity of the target manifolds by Lamm \cite{Lamm05}. Moreover, the
energy convexity along the flow yields the uniform convergence of the flow
which is not known before. One of the key ingredients in our proofs is a

transition adjustment can be tuned to eliminate also the second-order effect of
the environmental noise with moderate drive fields. A further improvement of
more than 1 order of magnitude in the coherence time is expected and confirmed
by simulations. Hence, our scheme prolongs the coherence time towards the

well-structured 3-dimensional truss stiffness matrices. These linear systems
arise from linear elasticity problems, and can be viewed as extensions of graph
Laplacians into higher dimensions. Faster solvers for the 2-D variants of such
systems have been studied using generalizations of tools for solving graph
Laplacians [Daitch-Spielman CSC'07, Shklarski-Toledo SIMAX'08].
  Given a 3-dimensional truss over $n$ vertices which is formed from a union of
$k$ convex structures (tetrahedral meshes) with bounded aspect ratios, whose
individual tetrahedrons are also in some sense well-conditioned, our algorithm
solves a linear system in the associated stiffness matrix up to accuracy
$\epsilon$ in time $O(k^{1/3} n^{5/3} \log (1 / \epsilon))$. This
asymptotically improves the running time $O(n^2)$ by Nested Dissection for all
$k \ll n$.
  We also give a result that improves on Nested Dissection even when we allow
any aspect ratio for each of the $k$ convex structures (but we still require
well-conditioned individual tetrahedrons). In this regime, we improve on Nested
Dissection for $k \ll n^{1/44}$.
  The key idea of our algorithm is to combine nested dissection and support
theory. Both of these techniques for solving linear systems are well studied,
but usually separately. Our algorithm decomposes a 3-dimensional truss into
separate and balanced regions with small boundaries. We then bound the spectrum
of each such region separately, and utilize such bounds to obtain improved
algorithms by preconditioning with partial states of separator-based Gaussian

multiple stellar populations and light element anti-correlations in globular
clusters. The success of the residual matter expulsion or its retention within
young stellar clusters has also a fundamental importance in order to understand
how star formation proceeds in present-day and ancient star-forming galaxies
and if proto-globular clusters with multiple stellar populations are formed in
the present epoch. It is usually suggested that either the residual gas is
rapidly ejected from star-forming clouds by stellar winds and supernova
explosions, or that the enrichment of the residual gas and the formation of the
second stellar generation occur so rapidly, that the negative stellar feedback
is not significant. Here we continue our study of the early development of star
clusters in the extreme environments and discuss the restrictions that strong
radiative cooling and stellar mass segregation provide on the gas expulsion
from dense star-forming clouds. A large range of physical initial conditions in
star-forming clouds which include the star-forming cloud mass, compactness, gas
metallicity, star formation efficiency and effects of massive stars segregation
are discussed. It is shown that in sufficiently massive and compact clusters
hot shocked winds around individual massive stars may cool before merging with
their neighbors. This dramatically reduces the negative stellar feedback,
prevents the development of the global star cluster wind and expulsion of the
residual and the processed matter into the ambient interstellar medium. The
critical lines which separate the gas expulsion and the gas retention regimes

Our unbiased sample consists of 91 Hilda asteroids (Hildas) down to 1~km in

single-slope power law in the ~1-10 km diameter range with the best-fit
power-law slope of alpha = 0.38 +/- 0.02 in the differential absolute magnitude
distribution. Direct comparing the size distribution of Hildas with that of the
Jupiter Trojans measured from the same dataset Yoshida & Terai (2017) indicates
that the two size distributions are well similar to each other within a
diameter of ~10 km, while these shapes are distinguishable from that of
main-belt asteroids. The results suggest that Hildas and Jupiter Trojans share
a common origin and have a different formation environment from main-belt
asteroids. The total number of the Hilda population larger than 2 km in

less than that of the Jupiter Trojan population by a factor of about five.

system formation, which coincides with the formation and possible migration of
Jupiter. While nebular gas from the protoplanetary disk was still present,
Jupiter may have migrated inwards and tacked at 1.5 AU in a 3:2 resonance with
Saturn. This migration excited planetary building blocks in the inner solar
system, resulting in extensive mixing and planetesimal removal. Here we
evaluate the plausible nature of Mars' building blocks, focusing in particular
on how its growth was influenced by the formation and migration of Jupiter. We
use a combination of dynamical simulations and an isotopic mixing model that
traces the accretion of elements with different affinities for metal. Dynamical
simulations show that Jupiter's migration causes the late stages of Earth's and
Mars' accretion to be dominated by EC-type (enstatite chondrite) material due
to the loss of OC (ordinary chondrite) planetesimals. Our analysis of available
isotopic data for SNC meteorites shows that Mars consists of approximately
68%$^{+0}_{-39}$ EC + 32%$^{+35}_{-0}$ OC by mass (2{\sigma}). The large
uncertainties indicate that isotopic analyses of martian samples are for the
most part too imprecise to definitely test model predictions; in particular it
remains uncertain whether or not Mars accreted predominantly EC material in the
latter stages of its formation history. Dynamical simulations also provide no
definitive constraint on Mars' accretion history due to the great variety of
dynamical pathways that the martian embryo exhibits. The present work calls for
new measurements of isotopic anomalies in SNC meteorites targeting siderophile
elements (most notably Ni, Mo and Ru) to constrain Mars' accretion history and
its formation location.

proceed in two complementary directions. First, we study the specific Bell
scenario defined by the Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu (CGLMP) inequality.
Second, we consider the nonlocality of the same states under a more general
perspective, by directly addressing the space of joint probabilities (computing
the frequencies of behaviours outside the local polytope). In both approaches
we find that the nonlocality decreases as the dimension $d$ grows, but in quite
distinct ways. While the drop in the probability of violation is exponential in
the CGLMP scenario, it presents, at most, a linear decay in the space of
behaviours. Furthermore, in both cases the states that produce maximal numeric
violations in the CGLMP inequality present low probabilities of violation in
comparison with maximally entangled states, so, no anomaly is observed.
Finally, the nonlocality of states with non-maximal Schmidt rank is
investigated.

for bipedal stability assessment, but its accuracy depends on the accuracy the
BoS geometry measurement. This work presents a method to ease the BoS tracking
by the identification of a reference frame that allows to define postural
models of the BoS geometry. Although we also propose a geometry based on the
geometry determined from centre of pressure range of motion within the foot
obtained from literature, this methodology can be used with other models (i.e.,
the feasible base of support). The model has been tested with 12 healthy
subjects, which have been asked to explore their stability in six different
postures. The results show that the model can accurate deform the geometry of
the BoS to adapt its shape to the different postures, which can remove the
necessity of force/torque sensors in some application. Potentially the proposed
method can be also applied to describe any posture dependent attribute (e.g.,
gravitational forces), and it can be also applied to bipedal robots. Therefore,
it constitutes a novel mathematical tool that can be deployed to develop both
better sensors and models for bipeds. For example, it can be used with the
Extrapolated CoM model to evaluate dynamic stability from the body kinematics.

oblate-triaxial ellipsoids (32%). The typical flattening (intrinsic C/A
semiaxis ratio) of the bars in our sample is 0.34, which matches well the
typical intrinsic flattening of stellar discs at these galaxy masses. We
demonstrate that, for prolate-triaxial bars, the intrinsic shape of bars
depends on the galaxy Hubble type and stellar mass (bars in massive S0 galaxies
are thicker and more circular than those in less massive spirals). The bar
intrinsic shape correlates with bulge, disc, and bar parameters. In particular
with the bulge-to-total (B/T) luminosity ratio, disc g-r color, and central
surface brightness of the bar, confirming the tight link between bars and their

abundance for a power spectrum peak ${\cal P_R} \sim 10^{-2}$ and large
reheating temperature and, furthermore, for a moderate peak ${\cal P_R} \sim
10^{-5}$ and reheating temperature $T_\text{rh}\sim 10^7$ GeV, characteristic
of the position of the power spectrum peak. Regarding the CMB observables, the
$\alpha$-attractor models utilized here to generate PBH in the low-mass region
predict in general a smaller $n_s$ and larger $r$ and $\alpha_s$ parameter
values compared to the conventional inflationary $\alpha$-attractor models.

Prediction"" (\textit{CVR}) are included, where \textit{CVR} module is a crucial
factor that affects the final purchasing volume directly. However, it is indeed
very challenging due to its sparseness nature. In this paper, we tackle this
problem by proposing multi-Level Deep Cascade Trees (\textit{ldcTree}), which
is a novel decision tree ensemble approach. It leverages deep cascade
structures by stacking Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (\textit{GBDT}) to
effectively learn feature representation. In addition, we propose to utilize
the cross-entropy in each tree of the preceding \textit{GBDT} as the input
feature representation for next level \textit{GBDT}, which has a clear
explanation, i.e., a traversal from root to leaf nodes in the next level
\textit{GBDT} corresponds to the combination of certain traversals in the
preceding \textit{GBDT}. The deep cascade structure and the combination rule
enable the proposed \textit{ldcTree} to have a stronger distributed feature
representation ability. Moreover, inspired by ensemble learning, we propose an
Ensemble \textit{ldcTree} (\textit{E-ldcTree}) to encourage the model's
diversity and enhance the representation ability further. Finally, we propose
an improved Feature learning method based on \textit{EldcTree}
(\textit{F-EldcTree}) for taking adequate use of weak and strong correlation
features identified by pre-trained \textit{GBDT} models. Experimental results
on off-line data set and online deployment demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed methods.

alternative solution to tackle the high sampling cost challenge in the

nevertheless, is inherently limited by the convoluted process of jointly
learning control policy and configuring hyper-parameters (e.g., global/local
models, real and synthesized data, etc). The training process could be tedious
and prohibitively costly. In this research, we propose an ""reinforcement on
reinforcement"" (RoR) architecture to decompose the convoluted tasks into two
layers of reinforcement learning. The inner layer is the canonical model-based
RL training process environment (TPE), which learns the control policy for the
underlying system and exposes interfaces to access states, actions and rewards.
The outer layer presents an RL agent, called as AI trainer, to learn an optimal
hyper-parameter configuration for the inner TPE. This decomposition approach
provides a desirable flexibility to implement different trainer designs, called
as ""train the trainer"". In our research, we propose and optimize two
alternative trainer designs: 1) a uni-head trainer and 2) a multi-head trainer.

other baseline algorithms, our proposed Train-the-Trainer algorithm has a

seven major contaminant categories: persistent organic pollutants (POPs),
dioxins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides,
perfluorochemicals (PFCs), metals, and pharmaceutical and personal care

diseasome, protein-protein interactions (PPIs), and gene essentiality and found
that a few contaminants were targeted to many genes, and a few genes were
targeted by many contaminants. The contaminant targets were hub proteins in the
human PPI network, whereas the target proteins in most categories did not
contain abundant essential proteins. Generally, contaminant targets and
disease-associated proteins were closely associated with the PPI network, and
the closeness of the associations depended on the disease type and chemical
category. Network biology techniques were used to identify environmental
contaminants with broad effects on the human interactome and
contaminant-sensitive biomarkers. Moreover, this method enabled us to quantify
the relationship between environmental contaminants and human diseases, which
was supported by epidemiological and experimental evidence. These methods and

computational load, thereby rendering the FCA infeasible in many applications.
To overcome this drawback, we take a joint diagonalization approach, whereby
matrix inversion and matrix multiplication are reduced to mere inversion and
multiplication of diagonal entries. This makes the FastFCA-AS significantly
faster than the FCA and even applicable to observed data of long duration or a

break down for transverse optical depths above ~20 because so few of the
simulated photon packets reach the other side of the slab. When including
biasing techniques such as absorption/scattering splitting and path length
stretching, the simulated photon packets do reach the other side of the slab
but the biased weights do not necessarily add up to the correct solution. While
the noise levels seem to be acceptable, the average values sometimes severely
underestimate the correct solution. Detecting these anomalies requires the
judicious application of statistical tests, similar to those used in the field
of nuclear particle transport, possibly in combination with convergence tests
employing consecutively larger numbers of photon packets. In any case, for
transverse optical depths above ~75 the Monte Carlo methods used in our study
fail to solve the one-dimensional slab problem, implying the need for
approximations such as a modified random walk.

of the time-dependent photophysical processes that occur upon photoexcitation
of a type-II heterojunction between the polymer PTB7 and monolayer MoS2. In
particular, photoinduced electron transfer from PTB7 to electronically hot
states of MoS2 occurs in less than 250 fs. This process is followed by a slower
(1-5 ps) exciton diffusion-limited electron transfer from PTB7 to MoS2 with a
yield of 58%, and a sub-3-ps photoinduced hole transfer from MoS2 to PTB7. The
equilibrium between excitons and polaron pairs in PTB7 determines the charge
separation yield, whereas the 3-4 ns lifetime of photogenerated carriers is
limited by MoS2 defects. Overall, this work elucidates the mechanisms of
ultrafast charge carrier dynamics at PTB7-MoS2 interfaces, which will inform
ongoing efforts to exploit polymer-2D semiconductor heterojunctions for

difficult Ising spin-glass ground-state problems are those related to lattices
which exhibit a finite-temperature spin-glass transition. Here, we show that
adding small-world couplers between qubits (spins) to the native quasi-planar
quantum processing unit graph results in a topology where a disordered Ising
system can undergo a finite-temperature spin-glass transition, even when an
Ising spin glass on the quasi-planar native graph does not display a transition
into a glassy phase at any finite temperature. To ensure that these systems can
be engineered with current fabrication techniques, using large-scale Monte
Carlo simulations we demonstrate that highly-constrained systems restricted to
a few fabrication layers and with fixed coupler angles can also exhibit a
finite-temperature spin-glass transition. This indicates that these systems
might be mean-field-like, which also means that embedding highly-nonplanar
problems might be simplified when compared to the underlying native topology.
Our results are illustrated using the quasi-planar Chimera topology currently

approaches work only in bright environments in which subtle
photoplethysmographic and ballistocardiographic signals can be easily analyzed
and/or require expensive and custom hardware to perform the measurements.
  Approach: This work introduces a low-cost method to measure subtle motions
associated with the carotid pulse and breathing movement from the neck using
near-infrared (NIR) video imaging. A skin reflection model of the neck was
established to provide a theoretical foundation for the method. In particular,
the method relies on template matching for neck detection, Principal Component
Analysis for feature extraction, and Hidden Markov Models for data smoothing.
  Main Results: We compared the estimated HR and BR measures with ones provided
by an FDA-cleared device in a 12-participant laboratory study: the estimates
achieved a mean absolute error of 0.36 beats per minute and 0.24 breaths per

physiological measurement in real-life conditions in which environmental
illumination is limited and in which the face of the person is not readily
available or needs to be protected. Due to the increasing availability of NIR

problems in satellite imagery analytics. While object detection in ground-based

transitioning such technology to overhead imagery is nontrivial. Among the
challenges is the sheer number of pixels and geographic extent per image: a
single DigitalGlobe satellite image encompasses >64 km2 and over 250 million
pixels. Another challenge is that objects of interest are minuscule (often only
~10 pixels in extent), which complicates traditional computer vision
techniques. To address these issues, we propose a pipeline (You Only Look
Twice, or YOLT) that evaluates satellite images of arbitrary size at a rate of
>0.5 km2/s. The proposed approach can rapidly detect objects of vastly
different scales with relatively little training data over multiple sensors. We
evaluate large test images at native resolution, and yield scores of F1 > 0.8
for vehicle localization. We further explore resolution and object size
requirements by systematically testing the pipeline at decreasing resolution,
and conclude that objects only ~5 pixels in size can still be localized with
high confidence. Code is available at https://github.com/CosmiQ/yolt.

localizing positive point sources in an image, blurred by the point spread
function of the imaging device. To recover the point sources, we propose to
solve a convex feasibility program, which simply finds a nonnegative Borel
measure that agrees with the observations collected by the imaging device.
  In the absence of imaging noise, we show that solving this convex program
uniquely retrieves the point sources, provided that the imaging device collects
enough observations. This result holds true if the point spread function of the
imaging device can be decomposed into horizontal and vertical components, and
if the translations of these components form a Chebyshev system, i.e., a system
of continuous functions that loosely behave like algebraic polynomials.
  Building upon recent results for one-dimensional signals [1], we prove that
this super-resolution algorithm is stable, in the generalized Wasserstein
metric, to model mismatch (i.e., when the image is not sparse) and to additive
imaging noise. In particular, the recovery error depends on the noise level and
how well the image can be approximated with well-separated point sources. As an
example, we verify these claims for the important case of a Gaussian point
spread function. The proofs rely on the construction of novel interpolating
polynomials---which are the main technical contribution of this paper---and
partially resolve the question raised in [2] about the extension of the

under the Grassmann Wigner-Weyl-Moyal (WWM) qubit formalism. Furthermore, the
transformation in this formalism can be fully expressed at order $\hbar^0$ and
so does not qualify as a candidate quantum phenomenon. In particular, we find
that the Grassmann WWM formalism at order $\hbar^0$ corresponds to an
ontological model governed by an additional set of constraints arising from the
relations defining the Grassmann algebra. Due to this additional set of
constraints, the allowed probability distributions in this model do not form a
single convex set when expressed in terms of disjoint ontic states and so
cannot be mapped to models whose states form a single convex set over disjoint
ontic states. However, expressing the Grassmann WWM ontological model in terms
of non-disjoint ontic states corresponding to the monomials of the Grassmann
algebra results in a single convex set. We further show that a recent result by
Lillystone et al. that proves a broad class of preparation and measurement
non-contextual ontological models must exhibit transformation contextuality
lacks the generality to include the ontological model considered here;
Lillystone et al.'s result is appropriately limited to ontological models whose
states produce a single convex set when expressed in terms of disjoint ontic
states. Therefore, we prove that for the qubit stabilizer subtheory to be
captured by a preparation, transformation and measurement non-contextual
ontological theory, it must be expressed in terms of non-disjoint ontic states,
unlike the case for the odd-dimensional single-qudit stabilizer subtheory.

particle and wave effects are coupled together, that is their individual
contributions to phonon transport cannot be figured out. Here, we present how
to quantify the particle and wave effects on phonon transport by combining
Monte Carlo and atomic green function methods. We apply it to 1D silicon
nanophononic metamaterial with cross-junctions, where it has been thought that
the wave effect was the main modulator to block phonon transport and the
particle effect was negligibly weak. Surprisingly, we find that the particle
effect is quite significant as well and can contribute as much as 39% to the
total thermal conductivity reduction. Moreover, the particle effect does not
decrease much as the cross section area (CSA) of the structure decreases and
still keeps quite strong even for CSA as small as 2.23 nm2. Further phonon
transmission analysis by reducing the junction leg length also qualitatively
demonstrates the strong particle effect. The results highlight the importance
of mutually controlling particle and wave characteristics, and the
methodologies for quantifying phonon particle and wave effect are important for

useful in many prospective applications including surveillance, patient
monitoring systems, etc. With the surge of deep learning methods in the recent
years, researchers have tried a wide spectrum of methods for different
applications. However, for the case of irregularity or anomaly detection in
videos, training an end-to-end model is still an open challenge, since often
irregularity is not well-defined and there are not enough irregular samples to
use during training. In this paper, inspired by the success of generative
adversarial networks (GANs) for training deep models in unsupervised or
self-supervised settings, we propose an end-to-end deep network for detection
and fine localization of irregularities in videos (and images). Our proposed
architecture is composed of two networks, which are trained in competing with
each other while collaborating to find the irregularity. One network works as a
pixel-level irregularity Inpainter, and the other works as a patch-level
Detector. After an adversarial self-supervised training, in which I tries to
fool D into accepting its inpainted output as regular (normal), the two
networks collaborate to detect and fine-segment the irregularity in any given
testing video. Our results on three different datasets show that our method can
outperform the state-of-the-art and fine-segment the irregularity.

qualitatively distinct transport features. In the first, the vibrations are
global and affect the two chromophores simultaneously. In the second case, the
vibrations are localized on each chromophore. For global vibrations, the
current exhibits {\sl anti-resonances} as a function of the chromophore energy
difference, which are due to exciton-polaron interference. For local
vibrations, on the other hand, the currents shows tunneling {\sl resonances} at
multiples of the vibration energy. Counter-intuitively, both effects increase
with increasing temperature. Our results demonstrate that an environment can

provide an interesting insight into the relationship between the Co-Co

distances. The \emph{strong} suppression of the $dp\sigma$-hybridization
between Co $d$ and O $p$ orbitals in brownmillerite SrCoO$_{2.5}$ brings on the
high-spin state of Co$^{3+}$ $d^{6}$ and is responsible for the
antiferromagnetically ordered insulating ground state. The increase of
effective Co-Co distances driven by the presence of oxygen vacancies in
SrCoO$_{3-\delta}$ is consistent with the reduction of the effective
$pd$-hybridization between Co $d$ and O $p$ orbitals. We conclude that the
configuration of neighboring Co spins is shown to be crucial to their local
electronic structure near the metal-to-insulator transition along the line of
the topotactic transition in SrCoO$_{3-\delta}$. Incidentally, we also find

followed by photon emission by plasmonic antenna. The emission rate is
determined by intimate interplay between the plasmon coupling to radiation

provide consistent definition of plasmon mode volume by relating it to plasmon

We show that, for QE placed at a ""hot spot"" near a sharp tip of a small metal

Three regimes of motion are clearly identified in the diffusion process:
ballistic, Brownian and intermediate which are well characterized, for the
first two regimes, through the mean square displacements and Einstein relation
for the diffusion constant. The Langevin formalism is used by considering Ohmic
friction, moderate surface temperatures and small coverages. In the Bohmian
framework, the starting point is the so-called Schr\""odinger-Langevin equation
which is a nonlinear, logarithmic differential equation. By assuming a Gaussian
function for the probability density, the corresponding quantum stochastic
trajectories are given by a dressing scheme consisting of a classical
stochastic trajectory of the center of the Gaussian wave packet, issued from
solving the Langevin equation (particle property), plus the time evolution of
its width governed by the damped Pinney differential equation (wave property).
The velocity autocorrelation function is the same as the classical one when the

the theory and experiment is achieved at $d = (15-18)$ nm, where the ratio
between the calculated and experimental masses reaches the value of two and
begins to decrease with a further $d$ increase. We assume that observed
behavior of the electron effective mass results from the spectrum
renormalization due to electron-electron interaction.

investigation reveals some temporal and spatial regularities in coronal hole

results show that the non-polar coronal hole longitudinal distribution follows
all configuration changes in the global magnetic-field structure.
Reorganizations of the global magnetic-field and coronal hole distributions
occur simultaneously during a time interval of a few solar rotations. The cycle
evolution of the non-polar coronal holes reflects the transition of the solar
global magnetic field from the zonal structure to sectorial andvice versa. Two
different type waves of non-polar coronal holes are revealed from their
latitudinal distribution. The first one is short poleward waves. They trace the
poleward motion of the unipolar photospheric magnetic fields from approximately
35 deg to the associated pole in each hemisphere and the redevelopment of a
new-polarity polar CH. Although they start the poleward movement before the
change of the polar magnetic field in the associated hemisphere, they reach the
pole after the polar reversal. The other type of non-polar CH wave forms two
sinusoidal branches associated with the positive- and negative-polarity
magnetic fields. The complete period of the wave was equal to approximately 268
CRs (22 years). These wave CHs arrive at high latitudes during declining phases

time dilation by measuring the relative spectral shift between the resonance
spectra of a rotating Mossbauer absorber with acceleration anti-parallel and
parallel to the direction of the incident beam. Based on the experiences and
know-how acquired in our previous experiments, We collected data for rotation
frequencies up to 510Hz in both directions of rotation and also used different
slits. For each run with high rotation, we observed a stable statistically
significant relative shift between the spectra of the two states with opposite
acceleration. This indicates the influence of acceleration on time dilation.
However, we found that this shift also depends on the choice of the slit, and
on the direction of rotation. These new unexpected findings, resulting from the
loss of symmetry in obtaining the resonant lines in the two states, could
overshadow the relative shift due to acceleration. This loss of the symmetry is
caused by the deflection of the radiative decay due to the Nuclear Lighthouse
effect from the rotating Mossbauer absorber. We also found that it is
impossible to keep the alignment (between the optical and the dynamical rotor
systems) with accuracy needed for such experiment, for long runs, which
resulted in the reduction of the accuracy of the observed relative shift. These
prevent us to claim with certainty the influence of acceleration on time
dilation using the currently available technology. An improved KB optics with
focal spot of less than 1 micron to avoid the use of a slit and a more rigid
mounting of the rotor system, are necessary for the success of such experiment.
Hopefully, these findings together with the indispensable plan for a conclusive
experiment presented in the paper, will prove useful to future experimentalists
wishing to pursue such an experiment.

recovering missing facts in a knowledge base. Intuitively, a relation can be
modeled by a matrix mapping entity vectors. However, relations reside on low
dimension sub-manifolds in the parameter space of arbitrary matrices---for one
reason, composition of two relations $\boldsymbol{M}_1,\boldsymbol{M}_2$ may
match a third $\boldsymbol{M}_3$ (e.g. composition of relations
currency_of_country and country_of_film usually matches
currency_of_film_budget), which imposes compositional constraints to be
satisfied by the parameters (i.e. $\boldsymbol{M}_1\cdot
\boldsymbol{M}_2\approx \boldsymbol{M}_3$). In this paper we investigate a
dimension reduction technique by training relations jointly with an
autoencoder, which is expected to better capture compositional constraints. We
achieve state-of-the-art on Knowledge Base Completion tasks with strongly
improved Mean Rank, and show that joint training with an autoencoder leads to
interpretable sparse codings of relations, helps discovering compositional
constraints and benefits from compositional training. Our source code is

content-based approaches. However, pure collaborative filtering models have at
least one of the following limitations: (1) they can only extend playlists
profiled at training time; (2) they misrepresent songs that occur in very few
playlists. We introduce a novel hybrid playlist continuation model based on
what we name ""playlist-song membership"", that is, whether a given playlist and
a given song fit together. The proposed model regards any playlist-song pair
exclusively in terms of feature vectors. In light of this information, and
after having been trained on a collection of labeled playlist-song pairs, the
proposed model decides whether a playlist-song pair fits together or not.
Experimental results on two datasets of curated music playlists show that the

profiled at training time and where songs occurred frequently in training
playlists. In contrast to the collaborative filtering model, and as a result of
its general understanding of the playlist-song pairs in terms of feature

predicts that as one moves downwards from $20\%$, $\Lambda/\overline{\Lambda}$
polarizations at first decrease but then \emph{increase} sharply, in a
characteristic pattern which should be readily detected if collisions can be
studied at impact energies below 200 GeV and centrality as low as $5 - 10\%$.
The effect should be most evident at moderate impact energies below 200 GeV, so
we give predictions for impact energy 27 GeV.

a direct band gap close to the peak of the solar spectrum and effective masses
allowing for efficient carrier transport of electrons in particular. These
results are rationalized by analysis of the electronic structure, which reveals
the formation of intermediate bands due to orbital-hybridization effects of the
Sb s-states. This study shows that the formation of intermediate bands can lead
to highly favorable electronic-structure properties of zero-dimensional
perovskites and discusses the possibility of fabricating lead-free HaPs with
promising optoelectronic properties by targeted substitution of ions and

It can either lock or encrypt the target devices, and victims are forced to pay
ransoms to restore their data. Hence, the prompt detection of such attacks has
a priority in comparison to other malicious threats. Previous works on Android
malware detection mainly focused on Machine Learning-oriented approaches that
were tailored to identifying malware families, without a clear focus on
ransomware. More specifically, such approaches resorted to complex information
types such as permissions, user-implemented API calls, and native calls.
However, this led to significant drawbacks concerning complexity, resilience
against obfuscation, and explainability. To overcome these issues, in this
paper, we propose and discuss learning-based detection strategies that rely on
System API information. These techniques leverage the fact that ransomware
attacks heavily resort to System API to perform their actions, and allow
distinguishing between generic malware, ransomware and goodware.
  We tested three different ways of employing System API information, i.e.,
through packages, classes, and methods, and we compared their performances to
other, more complex state-of-the-art approaches. The attained results showed
that systems based on System API could detect ransomware and generic malware
with very good accuracy, comparable to systems that employed more complex
information. Moreover, the proposed systems could accurately detect novel
samples in the wild and showed resilience against static obfuscation attempts.
Finally, to guarantee early on-device detection, we developed and released on
the Android platform a complete ransomware and malware detector (R-PackDroid)
that employed one of the methodologies proposed in this paper.

Landau states being harmon- ically driven by radiation. The second is a lattice
oscillation, i.e., an acoustic phonon mode. We analyze the dependence of the
beating pattern on temperature, radiation frequency and power. We conclude that
the beating pattern is an evidence of the radiation-driven nature of the
irradiated Landau states that makes them behave as a collective plasma

data. A useful preprocessing step is to group variables into clusters, however,
it is not always clear how to do so from the perspective of connectivity
estimation. Another practical challenge is that we may have data from multiple
related classes (e.g., multiple subjects or conditions) and wish to incorporate
constraints on the similarities across classes. We propose a probabilistic
model which simultaneously performs both a grouping of variables (i.e.,
detecting community structure) and estimation of connectivities between the
groups which correspond to latent variables. The model is essentially a factor
analysis model where the factors are allowed to have arbitrary correlations,
while the factor loading matrix is constrained to express a community
structure. The model can be applied on multiple classes so that the
connectivities can be different between the classes, while the community
structure is the same for all classes. We propose an efficient estimation
algorithm based on score matching, and prove the identifiability of the model.
Finally, we present an extension to directed (causal) connectivities over
latent variables. Simulations and experiments on fMRI data validate the
practical utility of the method.

it determines the thermal properties of a physical system. It is especially
important in cases where heating and cooling regulate significant processes,
such as in the collapse of molecular clouds, the development of gravitational
instabilities in protostellar discs, disc-planet interactions, and planet
migration. We compare two approximate radiative transfer methods which
indirectly estimate optical depths within hydrodynamic simulations using two
different metrics: (i) the gravitational potential and density of the gas
(Stamatellos et al.), and (ii) the pressure scale-height (Lombardi et al.). We
find that both methods are accurate for spherical configurations e.g. in
collapsing molecular clouds and within clumps that form in protostellar discs.
However, the pressure scale-height approach is more accurate in protostellar
discs (low and high-mass discs, discs with spiral features, discs with embedded
planets). We also investigate the $\beta$-cooling approximation which is
commonly used when simulating protostellar discs, and in which the cooling time
is proportional to the orbital period of the gas. We demonstrate that the use
of a constant $\beta$ cannot capture the wide range of spatial and temporal
variations of cooling in protostellar discs, which may affect the development
of gravitational instabilities, planet migration, planet mass growth, and the
orbital properties of planets.

risks since they need to disclose, at least partially, their locations to
benefit from these services. One possibility to limit these risks is to
obfuscate the location of a user by adding random noise drawn from a noise
function. In this paper, we require the noise functions to satisfy a generic
location privacy notion called $\ell$-privacy, which makes the position of the
user in a given region $\mathcal{X}$ relatively indistinguishable from other
points in $\mathcal{X}$. We also aim at minimizing the loss in the service
utility due to such obfuscation. While existing optimization frameworks regard
the region $\mathcal{X}$ restrictively as a finite set of points, we consider
the more realistic case in which the region is rather continuous with a
non-zero area. In this situation, we demonstrate that circular noise functions
are enough to satisfy $\ell$-privacy on $\mathcal{X}$ and equivalently on the
entire space without any penalty in the utility. Afterwards, we describe a
large parametric space of noise functions that satisfy $\ell$-privacy on
$\mathcal{X}$, and show that this space has always an optimal member,
regardless of $\ell$ and $\mathcal{X}$. We also investigate the recent notion
of $\epsilon$-geo-indistinguishability as an instance of $\ell$-privacy, and
prove in this case that with respect to any increasing loss function, the
planar Laplace noise function is optimal for any region having a nonzero area.

scenarios have been put forth to explain the superconductor to insulator
transition (SIT): dominating fermionic physics after the breaking of Cooper
pairs, loss of phase coherence between superconducting islands embedded in a
metallic or insulating matrix and localization of Cooper pairs with concomitant
condensation of vortex-type excitations. The difficulty in characterizing the
insulating state and its origin stems from the lack of a continuous mapping of
the superconducting to insulating phase diagram in a single sample. Here we use
the two-dimensional (2D) electron liquid formed at the interface between the
two insulators (111) SrTiO$_3$ and LaAlO$_3$ to study the superconductor to
insulator transition. This crystalline interface surprisingly exhibits very
strong features previously observed only in amorphous systems. By use of
electrostatic gating and magnetic fields, the sample is tuned from the metallic
region, where supeconductivity is fully manifested, deep into the insulating
state. Through examination of the field dependence of the sheet resistance and
comparison of the response to fields in different orientations we identify a
new magnetic field scale, H$_{pairing}$, where superconducting fluctuations are
muted. Our findings show that vortex fluctuations excitations and Cooper pair

(perception-inconsistent) in human perception. In this paper, we propose a
novel coarse-to-fine seam estimation method which applies the evaluation in a
different way. For pixels on the seam, we develop a patch-point evaluation
algorithm concentrating more on the correlation and variation of them. The
evaluations are then used to recalculate the difference map of the overlapping
region and reestimate a stitching seam. This evaluation-reestimation procedure
iterates until the current seam changes negligibly comparing with the previous
seams. Experiments show that our proposed method can finally find a nearly
perception-consistent seam after several iterations, which outperforms the
conventional seam-cutting and other seam-driven methods.

of applications, with a particular focus on environmental fields ranging from
climatology and hydrology to oceanography and seismic hazards. The
semi-parametric conditional extreme value model of Heffernan and Tawn (2004)
involving a multivariate regression provides the most suitable of current
statistical models in terms of its flexibility to handle a range of extremal
dependence classes. However, the standard inference for the joint distribution
of the residuals of this model suffers from the curse of dimensionality since
in a $d$-dimensional application it involves a $d-1$-dimensional non-parametric
density estimator, which requires, for accuracy, a number points and
commensurate effort that is exponential in $d$. Furthermore, it does not allow
for any partially missing observations to be included and a previous proposal
to address this is extremely computationally intensive, making its use
prohibitive if the proportion of missing data is non-trivial. We propose to
replace the $d-1$-dimensional non-parametric density estimator with a
model-based copula with univariate marginal densities estimated using kernel
methods. This approach provides statistically and computationally efficient
estimates whatever the dimension, $d$ or the degree of missing data. Evidence
is presented to show that the benefits of this approach substantially outweigh
potential mis-specification errors. The methods are illustrated through the
analysis of UK river flow data at a network of 46 sites and assessing the
rarity of the 2015 floods in north west England.

Yershov et al., a sample of 2783 SNe from the Sternberg Astronomical Institute.
Our analysis supports the prima facie existence of the correlation but
attributes it to a composite selection bias (high CMB T $\times$ high SNe $z$)
caused by the accidental alignment of seven deep survey fields with CMB
hotspots. These seven fields contain 9.2 per cent of the SNe sample (256 SNe).
Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient indicates the correlation present
in the whole sample ($\rho_s = 0.5$, p-value $= 6.7 \times 10^{-9}$) is
insignificant for a sub-sample of the seven fields together ($\rho_s = 0.2$,
p-value $= 0.2$) and entirely absent for the remainder of the SNe ($\rho_s =
0.1$, p-value $= 0.6$). We demonstrate the temperature and redshift biases of
these seven deep fields, and estimate the likelihood of their falling on CMB
hotspots by chance is at least $\sim$ 6.8 per cent (approximately 1 in 15). We

study their connections with Nijenhuis operators and the existence of weakly

begin with a rigorous setup of the problem in terms of the skew field $Q$ of
rational (pseudo--difference) operators over a difference field $F$ with a zero
characteristic subfield of constants $k\subset F$ and the principal ideal ring
$M_n(Q)$ of matrix rational (pseudo-difference) operators. In particular, we
give a criteria for a rational operator to be weakly non--local. A difference
operator $H$ is called preHamiltonian, if its image is a Lie $k$-subalgebra
with respect the the Lie bracket on $F$. Two preHamiltonian operators form a
preHamiltonian pair if any $k$-linear combination of them is preHamiltonian.
Then we show that a preHamiltonian pair naturally leads to a Nijenhuis
operator, and a Nijenhuis operator can be represented in terms of a
preHamiltonian pair. This provides a systematical method to check whether a
rational operator is Nijenhuis. As an application, we construct a
preHamiltonian pair and thus a Nijenhuis recursion operator for the
differential-difference equation recently discovered by Adler \& Postnikov. The
Nijenhuis operator obtained is not weakly non-local. We prove that it generates
an infinite hierarchy of local commuting symmetries. We also illustrate our
theory on the well known examples including the Toda, the Ablowitz-Ladik and
the Kaup-Newell differential-difference equations.

tidal encounters with a massive BH at galactic centres or potentially in dense
star clusters. The tidal disruption of stellar binaries by a massive BH is
known to produce hypervelocity stars. However, such a tidal encounter does not
always lead to the break-up of binaries. Since surviving binaries tend to
become hard and eccentric, this process can produce BH mergers in principle.
For initially circular binaries, we show that the gravitational wave (GW)
merger times become shorter by a factor of more than $10^{2}$ ($10^5$) in
$10\%$ ($1\%$) of the surviving cases. This reduction is primarily due to the
growth in binary's eccentricity at the tidal encounter. We also investigate the
effective spins of the survivors, assuming that BH spins are initially aligned
with the binary orbital angular momentum. We find that binary orientations can
flip in the opposite direction at the tidal encounter. For the survivors with
large merger time reduction factors, the effective spin distribution is rather
flat. We estimate the merger rate due to the tidal encounter channel to be
$\sim 0.6\ \textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\textrm{yr}^{-1}$. This mechanism is unlikely to be
the dominant formation channel of BH mergers. However, the current and
near-future GW observatories are expected to detect an enormous number of BH
mergers. If mergers are found in the vicinity of massive BHs (e.g. the
detection of GW lensing echoes or preceding extreme-mass-ratio bursts), this
mechanism would provide a possible explanation for their origin.

evaporates out of the spun jets and leads to thinning and solidification of the

interaction of the fibers with the surrounding airflow. Faced with industrial
applications producing up to several hundred fibers simultaneously, the direct
numerical simulation of the three-dimensional multiphase, multiscale problem is
computationally extremely demanding and thus in general not possible. In this
paper, we hence propose a dimensionally reduced, efficiently evaluable fiber
model that enables the realization of fiber-air interactions in a two-way
coupling with airflow computations. For viscous dry spinning of an uni-axial
two-phase flow, we deduce one-dimensional equations for fiber velocity and
stress from cross-sectional averaging and combine them with two-dimensional
advection-diffusion equations for polymer mass fraction and temperature
revealing the radial effects that are observably present in experiments. For
the numerical treatment of the resulting parametric boundary value problem
composed of one-dimensional ordinary differential equations and two-dimensional
partial differential equations we develop an iterative coupling algorithm.
Thereby, the solution of the advection-diffusion equations is implicitly given
in terms of Green's functions and leads for the surface values to Volterra
integral equations of second kind with singular kernel, which we can solve very
efficiently by the product integration method. For the ordinary differential
equations a suitable collocation-continuation procedure is presented. Compared
with the referential solution of a three-dimensional setting, the numerical
results are very convincing. They provide a good approximation while

are observed in nearly all globular clusters. One way to map such chemical
variations using high-precision photometry is to employ a suitable combination
of stellar magnitudes in the F275W, F336W, F438W, and F814W filters (the so
called ""chromosome map""), to maximise the separation between the different
multiple populations. For each individual cluster its chromosome map separates
the so-called first population -with metal abundance patterns typical of field
halo stars- from the second population, that displays distinctive abundance
variations among a specific group of light-elements. Surprisingly, the
distribution of first population stars in chromosome maps of several -but not
all- clusters has been found to be more extended than expected from purely
observational errors, suggesting a chemically inhomogeneous origin. We consider
here three clusters with similar metallicity ([Fe/H]~-1.3) and different
chromosome maps, namely NGC 288, M 3 and NGC 2808, and argue that the first
population extended distribution (as observed in two of these clusters) is due
to spreads of the initial helium abundance and possibly a small range of
nitrogen abundances as well. The presence of a range of initial He and N
abundances amongst stars traditionally thought to have homogeneous composition,
plus the fact that these spreads appear only in some clusters, challenge the
scenarios put forward so far to explain the multiple population phenomenon.

been used as models for neural recordings from animals performing these tasks.
While some progress has been made in performing such comparisons, the evolution
of network dynamics throughout learning remains unexplored. This is paralleled
by an experimental focus on recording from trained animals, with few studies
following neural activity throughout training. In this work, we address this
gap in the realm of artificial networks by analyzing networks that are trained
to perform memory and pattern generation tasks. The functional aspect of these
tasks corresponds to dynamical objects in the fully trained network - a line
attractor or a set of limit cycles for the two respective tasks. We use these
dynamical objects as anchors to study the effect of learning on their
emergence. We find that the sequential nature of learning has major
consequences for the learning trajectory and its final outcome. Specifically,
we show that Least Mean Squares (LMS), a simple gradient descent suggested as a
biologically plausible version of the FORCE algorithm, is constantly obstructed
by forgetting, which is manifested as the destruction of dynamical objects from
previous trials. The degree of interference is determined by the correlation
between different trials. We show which specific ingredients of FORCE avoid
this phenomenon. Overall, this difference results in convergence that is orders
of magnitude slower for LMS. Learning implies accumulating information across
multiple trials to form the overall concept of the task. Our results show that
interference between trials can greatly affect learning, in a learning rule
dependent manner. These insights can help design experimental protocols that
minimize such interference, and possibly infer underlying learning rules by
observing behavior and neural activity throughout learning.

order phase transitions when new bosons are triggers and their masses are
within range of some TeVs. Especially, in two pictures, the maximum strength of
the $SU(2) \rightarrow U(1)$ phase transition is equal to 2.12 so this EWPT is
not strong. Moreover, neutral fermions, which are candidates for Dark Matter

in order to be the strong first-order EWPT at TeV scale, the symmetry breaking
processes must produce more bosons than fermions or the mass of bosons must be
much larger than that of fermions.

its service (when imagined as an excludable public good) to maximize profit,
when each user's participation adds value to the platform service by creating a
positive externality to other participants. To characterize network
externalities as a function of the number of participants, we consider
different bounded and unbounded user utility models. The bounded utility model
fits many infrastructure sharing applications with bounded network value, in
which complete coverage has a finite user valuation (e.g., WiFi or hotspot).
The unbounded utility model fits the large scale data sharing and explosion in
social media, where it is expected that the network value follows Metcalfe's or
Zipf's law. For both models, we analyze the optimal pricing schemes to select
heterogeneous users in the platform under complete and incomplete information
of users' service valuations. We propose the concept of price of information
(PoI) to characterize the profit loss due to lack of information, and present
provable PoI bounds for different utility models. We show that the PoI=2 for
the bounded utility model, meaning that just half of profit is lost, whereas
the PoI>=2 for the unbounded utility model and increases as for a less concave
utility function. We also show that the complicated differentiated pricing
scheme which is optimal under incomplete user information, can be replaced by a
single uniform price scheme that is asymptotic optimal. Finally, we extend our
pricing schemes to a two-sided market by including a new group of `pure'
service users contributing no externalities, and show that the platform may
charge zero price to the original group of users in order to attract the pure

proton-lead collision, considering the interaction of these quarks with the
evolving Glasma by means of the Wong equations. Neglecting quantum fluctuations
at the initial time the Glasma is made of longitudinal fields, but the dynamics
leads to a quick formation of transverse fields; we estimate such a formation
time as $\Delta t\approx 0.1$ fm/c which is of the same order of the formation
time of heavy quark pairs $t_\mathrm{formation}\approx 1/(2m)$. Limiting
ourselves to the simple case of a static longitudinal geometry, we find that
heavy quarks are accelerated by the strong transverse color fields in the early
stage and this leads to a tilting of the $c-$quarks spectrum towards higher
$p_T$ states. This average acceleration can be understood in terms of drag and
diffusion of $c-$quarks in a hot medium and appears to be similar to the one
felt by the electrons ejected by the electron cannon in a cathode tube: we dub
this effect as {\it cathode tube effect}. The tilting of the spectrum affects

the BLR, one that is insensitive to microlensing (of size $\gtrsim$ 50
light-days and kinematics not confined to a plane) and another that shows up
only when it is magnified by microlensing (of size of a few light-days,
comparable to the accretion disk). Both regions can contribute in different
proportions to the emission lines of different species and, within each line
profile, to different velocity bins, all of which complicates detailed studies
of the BLR based on microlensing size estimates. The strength of the
microlensing indicates that some spectral features that make up the
pseudo-continuum, such as the shelf-like feature at {\lambda}1610 or several
FeIII blends, may in part arise from an inner region of the accretion disk. In
the case of FeII, microlensing is strong in some blends but not in others. This
opens up interesting possibilities to study quasar accretion disk kinematics.

spacetime that are forbidden in flat space. Therefore one has to be very
cautious about using the results calculated in Minkowskian space in early
universe applications. This is true for particle decay rates in particular,
which need to be calculated using quantum field theory in curved spacetime.
Previous studies are usually restricted to using minimal or conformal coupling
for the decaying particle, while using a more general coupling would give
deeper insight into particle decay. This paper presents the results we obtained
for a massive particle decaying in a general power-law universe with arbitrary
coupling to gravity. We find that depending on the value of the gravitational
coupling, the effect of gravitation may either strengthen or weaken the decay.
The analysis further reveals that, apart from radiation dominated universe,
there are values of the coupling constant for which the decay rate is exactly
Minkowskian for all universe types. Because the decay rate may be considerably
modified in curved space, these issues need to be considered when doing precise
cosmological calculations.

that the higher mass regime of the SZ clusters, compared to the X-ray sample,

we detect a redshift evolution in the substructure fraction, it is not
sufficient to explain the different results between the higher-z SZ sample and
the X-ray one. We have also verified a good agreement ($\sim$60$\%$) between
the optical and X-ray substructure estimates. However, the best level of
agreement is given by the substructure classification given by measures based
on the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), either the BCG$-$X-ray centroid offset,

those two parameters as the most reliable and cheap way to assess cluster

our scheme can be used on fast algorithms such as gradient methods with
momentum. We show optimal complexity bounds for quadratics and asymptotically
optimal rates on general convex minimization problems. Moreover, this new
scheme works online, i.e., extrapolated solution estimates can be reinjected at
each iteration, significantly improving numerical performance over classical
accelerated methods.

mass between 13 and 120 Msun, covering four metallicities (i.e. [Fe/H]=0, -1,
-2 and -3) and three initial rotation velocities (i.e. 0, 150 and 300 km/s).
The explosion has been simulated following three different assumptions in order
to show how the yields depend on the remnant mass - initial mass relation. An
extended network from H to Bi is fully coupled to the physical evolution of the
models. The main results can be summarized as follows. a) At solar metallicity
the maximum mass exploding as Red Super Giant (RSG) is of the order of 17 Msun
in the non rotating case, all the more massive stars exploding as WR stars. All
rotating models, vice versa, explode as Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. b) The interplay
between the core He burning and the H burning shell, triggered by the rotation
induced instabilities, drives the synthesis of a large primary amount of all
the products of the CNO, not just N14. A fraction of them enriches enormously
the radiative part of the He core (and is responsible of the large production
of F) and a fraction enters the convective core leading therefore to an
important primary neutron flux able to synthesize heavy nuclei up to Pb. c) In
our scenario, remnant masses of the order of those inferred by the first
detections of the gravitational waves (GW150914, GW151226, GW170104, GW170814)
are predicted at all metallicities for none or moderate initial rotation
velocities.

typical paths if the set of paths where the property fails is null with respect
to our outer measure. It turns out that adding the second term $\omega^2
-\langle \omega \rangle$ in the definition of the outer measure enables to
directly construct stochastic integrals which are continuous, even for typical
paths taking values in an infinite dimensional separable Hilbert space.
Moreover, when restricting to continuous paths whose quadratic variation is
absolutely continuous with uniformly bounded derivative, a second construction
of model-free stochastic integrals for typical paths is presented, which then
allows to solve in a model-free way stochastic differential equations for

binaries are bound in a quadruple star system; (2) a linear trend to the RV
curve of binary A is found over a 2-year interval, corresponding to an
acceleration, $\dot \gamma = 0.0024 \pm 0.0007$ cm s$^{-2}$; (3) small
irregular variations are seen in the eclipse-timing variations (`ETVs')
detected over the same interval; (4) the orbital separation of the quadruple
system is probably in the range of 8-25 AU; and (5) the orbital planes of the
two binaries must be inclined with respect to each other by at least
25$^\circ$. In addition, we find that binary B is evolved, and the cooler and
currently less massive star has transferred much of its envelope to the
currently more massive star. We have also demonstrated that the system is

important factors affecting the performance of deep neural networks. However,
there has not been much work on developing an established and systematic way of
building the structure and choosing the parameters of a neural network, and
this task heavily depends on trial and error and empirical results. Considering
that there are many design and parameter choices, such as the number of neurons
in each layer, the type of activation function, the choice of using drop out or
not, it is very hard to cover every configuration, and find the optimal
structure. In this paper, we propose a novel and systematic method that
autonomously and simultaneously optimizes multiple parameters of any given deep
neural network by using a generative adversarial network (GAN). In our proposed
approach, two different models compete and improve each other progressively
with a GAN-based strategy. Our proposed approach can be used to autonomously
refine the parameters, and improve the accuracy of different deep neural
network architectures. Without loss of generality, the proposed method has been
tested with three different neural network architectures, and three very
different datasets and applications. The results show that the presented
approach can simultaneously and successfully optimize multiple neural network
parameters, and achieve increased accuracy in all three scenarios.

for sparse networks with several examples. Scaling laws are derived and

slips occur between oscillators on the edges of the frequency distribution. If
the distribution is discrete, the probability-exponent for large fluctuations
to occur scales linearly with the system size. However, if the distribution is

individual oscillators fluctuate to saddles while all others remain fixed. In
the latter case, the network's coherence is approximately preserved.

retrocausal but not retro-signaling, respecting the conventional block universe
viewpoint of classical spacetime. Several example models are developed that
resolve the most essential problems with using classical electromagnetic fields
to explain single-photon phenomena. These models share some similarities with
Stochastic Electrodynamics, but without the infinite background energy problem,
and with a clear path to explaining entanglement phenomena. Intriguingly, the
average intermediate field intensities share a surprising connection with
quantum ""weak values"", even in the single-photon limit. This new class of
models is hoped to guide further research into spacetime-based accounts of weak
values, entanglement, and other quantum phenomena.

galaxies. We present measurements of the baryonic mass and specific angular
momentum of 11 void dwarf galaxies derived from neutral hydrogen (H{\sc i})
synthesis data. Rotation curves were measured using 3D and 2D tilted ring
fitting routines, and the derived curves generally overlap within the error
bars, except in the central regions where, as expected, the 3D routines give
steeper curves. The specific angular momentum of void dwarfs is found to be
high compared to an extrapolation of the trends seen for higher mass bulge-less
spirals, but comparable to that of other dwarf irregular galaxies that lie
outside of voids. As such, our data show no evidence for a dependence of the
specific angular momentum on the large scale environment. Combining our data
with the data from the literature, we find a baryonic threshold of $\sim
10^{9.1}~M_{\odot}$ for this increase in specific angular momentum.
Interestingly, this threshold is very similar to the mass threshold below which
the galaxy discs start to become systematically thicker. This provides
qualitative support to the suggestion that the thickening of the discs, as well
as the increase in specific angular momentum, are both results of a common
physical mechanism, such as feedback from star formation. Quantitatively,
however, the amount of star formation observed in our dwarfs appears
insufficient to produce the observed increase in specific angular momentum. It
is hence likely that other processes, such as cold accretion of high angular
momentum gas, also play a role in increasing the specific angular momentum.

  Non-Overlap: The Effect of Natural Gas Compressor Station Exposure on Cancer
  Mortality",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most causal inference studies rely on the assumption of overlap to estimate
population or sample average causal effects. When data exhibit non-overlap,
estimation of these estimands requires reliance on model specifications, due to
poor data support. All existing methods to address non-overlap, such as
trimming or down-weighting data in regions of poor support, change the
estimand. In environmental health research, where study results are often
intended to influence policy, changes in the estimand can diminish the study's
impact, because estimates may not be representative of effects in the
population of interest to policymakers. Researchers may be willing to make
additional, minimal modeling assumptions in order to preserve the ability to
estimate population average causal effects. We seek to make two contributions
on this topic. First, we propose a flexible, data-driven definition of
propensity score overlap and non-overlap regions. Second, we develop a novel
Bayesian framework to estimate population average causal effects with minor
model dependence and appropriately large uncertainties in the presence of
non-overlap. In this approach, the tasks of estimating causal effects in the
overlap and non-overlap regions are delegated to two distinct models, suited to
the degree of data support in each region. Tree ensembles are used to
non-parametrically estimate individual causal effects in the overlap region,
where the data can speak for themselves. In the non-overlap region, where
insufficient data support means reliance on model specification is necessary,
individual causal effects are estimated by extrapolating trends from the
overlap region via a spline model. The promising performance of our method is
demonstrated in simulations. Finally, we utilize our method to perform a novel
investigation of the causal effect of natural gas compressor station exposure
on cancer outcomes.

to obfuscate file and domain names. This technique creates process or domain
names that are visually similar to legitimate and recognized names. For
instance, an attacker may create malware with the name svch0st.exe so that in a
visual inspection of running processes or a directory listing, the process or
file name might be mistaken as the Windows system process svchost.exe. There
has been limited published research on detecting homoglyph attacks. Current
approaches rely on string comparison algorithms (such as Levenshtein distance)
that result in computationally heavy solutions with a high number of false
positives. In addition, there is a deficiency in the number of publicly
available datasets for reproducible research, with most datasets focused on
phishing attacks, in which homoglyphs are not always used. This paper presents
a fundamentally different solution to this problem using a Siamese
convolutional neural network (CNN). Rather than leveraging similarity based on
character swaps and deletions, this technique uses a learned metric on strings
rendered as images: a CNN learns features that are optimized to detect visual
similarity of the rendered strings. The trained model is used to convert
thousands of potentially targeted process or domain names to feature vectors.
These feature vectors are indexed using randomized KD-Trees to make similarity
searches extremely fast with minimal computational processing. This technique
shows a considerable 13% to 45% improvement over baseline techniques in terms
of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC). In
addition, we provide both code and data to further future research.

properties of a platoon of vehicles driving on a straight road. Motivated by
the positive impact of Delayed Acceleration Feedback (DAF) in various
scenarios, in this paper, we incorporate DAF into the Classical Car-Following
Model (CCFM). We begin by deriving the Classical Car-Following Model with
Delayed Acceleration Feedback (CCFM-DAF). We then derive the necessary and
sufficient condition for local stability of the CCFM-DAF. Next, we show that
the CCFM-DAF transits from the locally stable to the unstable regime via a Hopf
bifurcation; thus leading to the emergence of limit cycles in system dynamics.
We then propose a suitable linear transformation that enables us to analyze the
local bifurcation properties of the CCFM-DAF by studying the analogous
properties of the CCFM. We also study the impact of DAF on three important
dynamical properties of the CCFM; namely, non-oscillatory convergence, string
stability and robust stability. Our analyses are complemented with a stability
chart and a bifurcation diagram. Our work reveals the following detrimental
effects of DAF on the CCFM: (i) reduction in the locally stable region, (ii)
increase in the frequency of the emergent limit cycles, (iii) decrease in the
amplitude of the emergent limit cycles, (iv) destruction of the non-oscillatory
property, (vi) increased risk of string instability, and (vii) reduced
resilience towards parametric uncertainty. Thus, we report a
practically-relevant application wherein DAF degrades the performance in
several metrics of interest.

Results are given for transverse momenta in the range $2<p_{T}<10$ GeV/$c$

are sensitive to the polarized gluon parton distribution function, $\Delta

  We study a natural semi-random model of graphs with sparse vertex cuts. For
certain ranges of parameters, we give an algorithm to recover the planted

  In addition to being a family of instances that will help us to better
understand the complexity of the computation of vertex expansion, our model can
also be used in the study of community detection where only a few nodes from
each community interact with nodes from other communities. There has been a lot

for eight languages. By adding Italian, Russian, Japanese and Chinese, we cover
languages which are very different with respect to syntax, morphology, etc. We
provide strong baselines for all language transfer directions using

covering a linear, isotropic, homogeneous, lossless solid half space is
submitted to a vertically-propagating shear-horizontal plane, body wave. The
rigorous theory of this elastodynamic scattering problem is given and the means
by which it can be numerically solved are outlined. At quasi-static
frequencies, the solution is obtained from one linear equation in one unknown.
At higher, although still low, frequencies, a suitable approximation of the
solution is obtained from a system of two linear equations in two unknowns.
This solution is shown to be equivalent to that of the problem of a
vertically-propagating shear-horizontal plane body wave traveling in the same
solid medium as before, but with a linear, homogeneous, isotropic layer
replacing the previous uneven boundary. The thickness of this layer is equal to
the vertical distance between the extrema of the boundary uneveness and the
effective body wave velocity therein is equal to that of the underlying solid,
but the effective shear modulus of the layer, whose expression is given in
explicit algebraic form, is different from that of the underlying solid,
notably by the fact that it is dispersive and lossy. It is shown that this
dispersive, lossy effective layer, overriding the nondispersive, lossless solid
half space, gives rise to two distinctive features of low-frequency response: a
Love mode resonance and a Fixed-base shear wall pseudo-resonance. This model of
effective layer with dispersive, lossy properties, enables simple explanations
of how the low-frequency resonance and pseudo-resonance vary with the geometric
parameters (and over a wide range of the latter) of the uneven boundary.

and the streamfunction. Special focus is given to the case of the surface
quasi-geostrophic (SQG) equations, for which the existence of finite-time
singularities is still a matter of debate. Point vortex trajectories are
expressed using Nambu dynamics. The formulation is based on a noncanonical
bracket and allows for a geometrical interpretation of trajectories as
intersections of level sets of the Hamiltonian and Casimir. Within this
setting, we focus on the collapse of solutions for the three point vortex
model. In particular, we show that for SQG the collapse can be either
self-similar or non-self-similar. Self-similarity occurs only when the
Hamiltonian is zero, while non-self-similarity appears for non-zero values of
the same. For both cases, collapse is allowed for any choice of circulations
within a permitted interval. These results differ strikingly from the classical
point vortex model, where collapse is self-similar for any value of the
Hamiltonian, but the vortex circulations must satisfy a strict relationship.
Results may also shed a light on the formation of singularities in the SQG
partial differential equations, where the singularity is thought to be reached
only in a self-similar way.

question of paramount importance. As a matter of fact, in sensitive settings
misclassification can lead to dramatic consequences. Such misclassifications
are likely to occur when facing adversarial attacks, hardware failures or
limitations, and imperfect signal acquisition. To address this question,
authors have proposed different approaches aiming at increasing the robustness
of DNNs, such as adding regularizers or training using noisy examples. In this
paper we propose a new regularizer built upon the Laplacian of similarity
graphs obtained from the representation of training data at each layer of the
DNN architecture. This regularizer penalizes large changes (across consecutive
layers in the architecture) in the distance between examples of different
classes, and as such enforces smooth variations of the class boundaries. Since
it is agnostic to the type of deformations that are expected when predicting
with the DNN, the proposed regularizer can be combined with existing ad-hoc
methods. We provide theoretical justification for this regularizer and
demonstrate its effectiveness to improve robustness of DNNs on classical
supervised learning vision datasets.

at least n + 1 extremal points, i.e. minimal ones and maximal zeros. We show
that f has exactly n + 1 extremal points if and only if it is linear read-once.
The class of linear read-once functions is known to be the intersection of the
classes of read-once and threshold functions. Generalizing this result we show
that the class of linear read-once functions is the intersection of read-once
and Chow functions. We also find the set of minimal read-once functions which
are not linear read-once and the set of minimal threshold functions which are
not linear read-once. In other words, we characterize the class of linear
read-once functions by means of minimal forbidden subfunctions within the
universe of read-once and the universe of threshold functions. Within the
universe of threshold functions the importance of linear read-once func- tions
is due to the fact that they attain the minimum value of the specification
number, which is n + 1 for functions depending on n variables. In 1995 Anthony

  Importance of Pore Space Connectivity for Cell Operation","Main article on pages on pages 1-8, supporting information on pages
  9-15",,,,"physics.app-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The structure of lithium ion battery components, such as electrodes and
separators, are commonly characterised in terms of their porosity and
tortuosity. The ratio of these values gives the effective transport of lithium
ions in the electrolyte-filled pore spaces, which can be used to determine the
ionic resistivity and corresponding voltage losses. Here, we show that these
microstructural characteristics are not sufficient. Analysis of tomographic
data of commercial separators reveals that different polyolefin separators have
similar porosity and through-plane tortuosity, which, in the homogenised
picture of lithium ion cell operation, would imply that these different
separators exhibit similar performance. However, numerical diffusion
simulations indicate that this is not the case. We demonstrate that the extent
to which lithium ion concentration gradients are induced or smoothed by the
separator structure is linked to pore space connectivity, a parameter that can
be determined by topological or network based analysis of separators. These
findings enable us to propose how to design separator microstructures that are
safer and accommodate fast charge and discharge.

literature has increased exponentially in size. Consequently, there is a great
need for systems that can ingest these documents at scale and make the
contained knowledge discoverable. Unfortunately, both the format of these
documents (e.g. the PDF format or bitmap images) as well as the presentation of
the data (e.g. complex tables) make the extraction of qualitative and
quantitive data extremely challenging. In this paper, we present a modular,
cloud-based platform to ingest documents at scale. This platform, called the
Corpus Conversion Service (CCS), implements a pipeline which allows users to
parse and annotate documents (i.e. collect ground-truth), train
machine-learning classification algorithms and ultimately convert any type of
PDF or bitmap-documents to a structured content representation format. We will
show that each of the modules is scalable due to an asynchronous microservice
architecture and can therefore handle massive amounts of documents.
Furthermore, we will show that our capability to gather ground-truth is
accelerated by machine-learning algorithms by at least one order of magnitude.
This allows us to both gather large amounts of ground-truth in very little time
and obtain very good precision/recall metrics in the range of 99\% with regard
to content conversion to structured output. The CCS platform is currently
deployed on IBM internal infrastructure and serving more than 250 active users
for knowledge-engineering project engagements.

challenging task. Here, we consider online dictionary learning (DL) methods to
obtain sparse representations (SR) of the GPR data to enhance feature
extraction for target classification via support vector machines. Online
methods are preferred because traditional batch DL like K-SVD is not scalable
to high-dimensional training sets and infeasible for real-time operation. We
also develop Drop-Off MINi-batch Online Dictionary Learning (DOMINODL) which
exploits the fact that a lot of the training data may be correlated. The
DOMINODL algorithm iteratively considers elements of the training set in small
batches and drops off samples which become less relevant. For the case of
abandoned anti-personnel landmines classification, we compare the performance
of K-SVD with three online algorithms: classical Online Dictionary Learning,
its correlation-based variant, and DOMINODL. Our experiments with real data
from L-band GPR show that online DL methods reduce learning time by 36-93% and
increase mine detection by 4-28% over K-SVD. Our DOMINODL is the fastest and
retains similar classification performance as the other two online DL
approaches. We use a Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test distance and the
Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz inequality for the selection of DL input parameters
leading to enhanced classification results. To further compare with
state-of-the-art classification approaches, we evaluate a convolutional neural
network (CNN) classifier which performs worse than the proposed approach.
Moreover, when the acquired samples are randomly reduced by 25%, 50% and 75%,
sparse decomposition based classification with DL remains robust while the CNN
accuracy is drastically compromised.

used, which utilize license-free bands. As a consequence of these mutual
interferences of wireless systems might decrease the state of coexistence.
Therefore, a central coexistence management system is needed, which allocates
conflict-free resources to wireless systems. To ensure a conflict-free resource
utilization, it is useful to predict the prospective medium utilization before
resources are allocated. This paper presents a self-learning concept, which is
based on reinforcement learning. A simulative evaluation of reinforcement
learning agents based on neural networks, called deep Q-networks and double
deep Q-networks, was realized for exemplary and practically relevant
coexistence scenarios. The evaluation of the double deep Q-network showed that
a prediction accuracy of at least 98 % can be reached in all investigated
scenarios.

partitioning the graph into more densely connected subsets of nodes. In
contrast, the ""search"" problem of this paper aims to only find the nodes in a
""single"" such community, the target, out of the many communities that may
exist. To do so , we are given suitable side information about the target; for
example, a very small number of nodes from the target are labeled as such.
  We consider a general yet simple notion of side information: all nodes are
assumed to have random weights, with nodes in the target having higher weights
on average. Given these weights and the graph, we develop a variant of the
method of moments that identifies nodes in the target more reliably, and with
lower computation, than generic community detection methods that do not use
side information and partition the entire graph. Our empirical results show
significant gains in runtime, and also gains in accuracy over other graph
clustering algorithms.
