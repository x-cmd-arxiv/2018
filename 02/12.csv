interface (GUI), combining monkey testing and difference testing. Since this
combination sidesteps the oracle problem, it enables the generation of
GUI-based regression tests. ReTest makes use of evolutionary computing (EC),
particularly a genetic algorithm (GA), to optimize these tests towards code
coverage. While this is indeed a desirable goal in terms of software testing
and potentially finds many bugs, it lacks one major ingredient: human behavior.
Consequently, human testers often find the results less reasonable and
difficult to interpret.
  This thesis proposes a new approach to improve the initial population of the
GA with the aid of machine learning (ML), forming an ML-technique enhanced-EC
(MLEC) algorithm. In order to do so, existing tests are exploited to extract
information on how human testers use the given GUI. The obtained data is then
utilized to train an artificial neural network (ANN), which ranks the available
GUI actions respectively their underlying GUI components at runtime---reducing
the gap between manually created and automatically generated regression tests.
Although the approach is implemented on top of ReTest, it can be easily used to
guide any form of monkey testing.
  The results show that with only little training data, the ANN is able to
reach an accuracy of 82% and the resulting tests represent an improvement
without reducing the overall code coverage and performance significantly.

adopted for demosaicing with any CFA design. We train CNN models for
demosaicing with three different CFAs and obtain better results than existing

first data-driven joint optimization of the CFA design and the demosaicing
method using CNN. Experiments show that the combination of the automatically

properties, but new properties are constantly being found. Most recently, by
incorporating heavy elements that can give rise to strong spin-orbit coupling
(SOC), non-trivial topological phases of matter, such as topological insulators
(TIs), have been discovered in Heusler materials. Moreover, the interplay of
symmetry, SOC and magnetic structure allows for the realization of a wide
variety of topological phases through Berry curvature design. Weyl points and
nodal lines can be manipulated by various external perturbations, which results
in exotic properties such as the chiral anomaly, and large anomalous spin and
topological Hall effects. The combination of a non-collinear magnetic structure
and Berry curvature gives rise a non-zero anomalous Hall effect, which was
first observed in the antiferromagnets Mn3Sn and Mn3Ge. Besides this k-space
Berry curvature, Heusler compounds with non-collinear magnetic structures also
possess real-space topological states in the form of magnetic antiskyrmions,
which have not yet been observed in other materials. The possibility of
directly manipulating the Berry curvature shows the importance of understanding
both the electronic and magnetic structures of Heusler compounds. Together,
with the new topological viewpoint and the high tunability, novel physical

counterpart of any given NN that is powered by kernel machines instead of
neurons. In terms of learning, when learning a feedforward deep architecture in
a supervised setting, one needs to train all the components simultaneously
using backpropagation (BP) since there are no explicit targets for the hidden
layers (Rumelhart86). We consider without loss of generality the two-layer case
and present a general framework that explicitly characterizes a target for the
hidden layer that is optimal for minimizing the objective function of the
network. This characterization then makes possible a purely greedy training
scheme that learns one layer at a time, starting from the input layer. We
provide realizations of the abstract framework under certain architectures and
objective functions. Based on these realizations, we present a layer-wise
training algorithm for an l-layer feedforward network for classification, where
l>=2 can be arbitrary. This algorithm can be given an intuitive geometric
interpretation that makes the learning dynamics transparent. Empirical results
are provided to complement our theory. We show that the kernelized networks,
trained layer-wise, compare favorably with classical kernel machines as well as

for almost four decades, but the behavior of the molecular spectrum and its
implications for solar atmospheric structure are not fully understood. Data
from the HRTS instrument revealed that H2 emission forms in particular regions,
selectively excited by bright UV transition region and chromospheric lines. We
test the conditions under which H2 emission can originate by studying non-LTE
models sampling a broad range of temperature stratifications and radiation
conditions. Stratification plays the dominant role in determining the
population densities of H2, which forms in greatest abundance near the
continuum photosphere. However, opacity due to photoionization of silicon and
other neutrals determines the depth to which UV radiation can penetrate to
excite the H2. Thus the majority of H2 emission forms in a narrow region, at
about 650 km in standard 1D models of the quiet-Sun, near the tau=1 opacity
surface for the exciting UV radiation, generally coming from above. When
irradiated from above using observed intensities of bright UV emission lines,
detailed non-LTE calculations show that the spectrum of H2 seen in the
quiet-Sun SUMER atlas spectrum and HRTS light bridge spectrum can be
satisfactorily reproduced in 1D stratified atmospheres, without including 3D or
time dependent thermal structures. A detailed comparison to observations from
1205 to 1550 Angstroms is presented, and the success of this 1D approach to

  With microscopic pointers, non-local effects of quantum entanglement can
indeed take place and introduce unexpected trajectories, as in Bell

with the measurement apparatus may influence the trajectory of the test

advances in producing large drug screens against cancer cell lines provided an
opportunity to apply machine learning methods for this purpose. In addition to
cytotoxicity databases, considerable amount of drug-induced gene expression
data has also become publicly available. Following this, several methods that
exploit omics data were proposed to predict drug activity on cancer cells.
However, due to the complexity of cancer drug mechanisms, none of the existing
methods are perfect. One possible direction, therefore, is to combine the
strengths of both the methods and the databases for improved performance. We
demonstrate that integrating a large number of predictions by the proposed
method improves the performance for this task. The predictors in the ensemble
differ in several aspects such as the method itself, the number of tasks method
considers (multi-task vs. single-task) and the subset of data considered
(sub-sampling). We show that all these different aspects contribute to the
success of the final ensemble. In addition, we attempt to use the drug screen
data together with two novel signatures produced from the drug-induced gene
expression profiles of cancer cell lines. Finally, we evaluate the method
predictions by in vitro experiments in addition to the tests on data sets.The

  Exploiting Invalidation-Based Coherence Protocols",,,,,"cs.CR cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recent Meltdown and Spectre attacks highlight the importance of automated
verification techniques for identifying hardware security vulnerabilities. We
have developed a tool for synthesizing microarchitecture-specific programs
capable of producing any user-specified hardware execution pattern of interest.
Our tool takes two inputs: a formal description of (i) a microarchitecture in a
domain-specific language, and (ii) a microarchitectural execution pattern of
interest, e.g. a threat pattern. All programs synthesized by our tool are
capable of producing the specified execution pattern on the supplied
microarchitecture.
  We used our tool to specify a hardware execution pattern common to
Flush+Reload attacks and automatically synthesized security litmus tests
representative of those that have been publicly disclosed for conducting
Meltdown and Spectre attacks. We also formulated a Prime+Probe threat pattern,
enabling our tool to synthesize a new variant of each---MeltdownPrime and
SpectrePrime. Both of these new exploits use Prime+Probe approaches to conduct
the timing attack. They are both also novel in that they are 2-core attacks
which leverage the cache line invalidation mechanism in modern cache coherence
protocols. These are the first proposed Prime+Probe variants of Meltdown and
Spectre. But more importantly, both Prime attacks exploit invalidation-based
coherence protocols to achieve the same level of precision as a Flush+Reload
attack. While mitigation techniques in software (e.g., barriers that prevent
speculation) will likely be the same for our Prime variants as for original
Spectre and Meltdown, we believe that hardware protection against them will be
distinct. As a proof of concept, we implemented SpectrePrime as a C program and
ran it on an Intel x86 processor, averaging about the same accuracy as Spectre
over 100 runs---97.9% for Spectre and 99.95% for SpectrePrime.

this work is to understand how these different parameters affect the transport

play. Concerning the solid beads we observe the appearance of two regimes, one
where the experimental mean velocity is close to the expected one and another
where this velocity is lower. This is directly related to a competition between
confinement, Brownian diffusion and advection. These two regimes are shown to
be linked to the homogeneity of particles distribution in the channel depth,
which we experimentally deduce from velocity distributions. This inhomogeneity
appears during the entrance process into the sub-micrometric channels, as for
hydrodynamic separation or deterministic lateral displacement. Concerning the
nature of the particles we observed a shift of transition towards the second
regime likely due to the relationships between shear stress and polymersomes

geometry of our device.

lifetime of wireless networks, wean communication devices off the battery and

wireless communications. In this paper, an interference aided energy harvesting
scheme is proposed for cooperative relaying systems, where energy-constrained
relays harvest energy from the received information signal and co-channel
interference signals, and then use that harvested energy to forward the
correctly decoded signal to the destination. The time-switching scheme (TS), in
which the receiver switches between decoding information and harvesting energy,
as well as the power-splitting scheme (PS), where a portion of the received
power is used for energy harvesting and the remaining power is utilized for
information processing, are adopted separately. Applying the proposed energy
harvesting approach to a decode-and-forward relaying system with the
three-terminal model, the analytical expressions of the ergodic capacity and
the outage capacity are derived, and the corresponding achievable throughputs
are determined. Comparative results are provided and show that PS is superior
to TS at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in terms of throughput, while at low
SNR, TS outperforms PS. Furthermore, considering different interference power
distributions with equal aggregate interference power at the relay, the
corresponding system capacity relationship, i.e., the ordering of capacities,
is obtained.

implied, suggests that given values for the fine- grained (FG) variables,

development and demonstration of a free-final-time problem formulation that can
be solved iteratively using a successive convexification framework. This paper
is an extension of our previous work on the 3-DoF free-final-time and the 6-DoF
fixed-final-time minimum-fuel problems. Herein, the vehicle is modeled as a
6-DoF rigid-body controlled by a single gimbaled rocket engine. The trajectory
is subject to a variety of convex and non-convex state- and
control-constraints, and aerodynamic effects are assumed negligible. The
objective of the problem is to determine the optimal thrust commands that will
minimize the time-of-flight while satisfying the aforementioned constraints.
Solving this problem quickly and reliably is challenging because (a) it is
nonlinear and non-convex, (b) the validity of the solution is heavily dependent
on the accuracy of the discretization scheme, and (c) it can be difficult to
select a suitable reference trajectory to initialize an iterative solution
process. To deal with these issues, our algorithm (a) uses successive
convexification to eliminate non-convexities, (b) computes the discrete
linear-time-variant system matrices to ensure that the converged solution
perfectly satisfies the original nonlinear dynamics, and (c) can be initialized
with a simple, dynamically inconsistent reference trajectory. Using the
proposed convex formulation and successive convexification framework, we are
able to convert the original non-convex problem into a sequence of convex
second-order cone programming (SOCP) sub-problems. Through the use of Interior
Point Method (IPM) solvers, this sequence can be solved quickly and reliably,
thus enabling higher fidelity real-time guidance for rocket powered landings on
Mars.

investigated using wind tunnel experiments and large-eddy simulations.
Measurements from the model wind turbine experiment reveal that the power
coefficient and turbine wake are affected by the operating regime. Simulations
employing a new class of actuator surface methods which parameterize both the
turbine blades and nacelle with and without a nacelle model are carried out for
each operating condition to study the influence of the operating regime and
nacelle. For simulations with a nacelle model, the mean flow field is composed
of an outer wake, caused by energy extraction from the incoming wind by the
turbine blades, and an inner wake directly behind the nacelle, while for the
simulations without a nacelle model, the central region of the wake is occupied
by a jet. The simulations with the nacelle model reveal an unstable helical hub
vortex expanding outwards towards the outer wake; while the simulations without
a nacelle model show a stable and columnar hub vortex. The hub vortex for the
turbine operating in Region 3 remains in a tight helical spiral and intercepts
the outer wake a few diameters further downstream than for the turbine
operating in Region 2. Wake meandering commences in a region of high turbulence
intensity for all simulations indicating that neither a nacelle model nor an
unstable hub vortex is a necessary requirement for wake meandering. However,
further analysis of the wake meandering using a filtering technique and dynamic
mode decomposition show that the unstable hub vortex energizes the wake
meandering. The turbine operating regime affects the shape and expansion of the
hub vortex altering the location of the onset of the wake meandering and its
oscillating intensity. The unstable hub vortex promotes a energetic meandering
which cannot be predicted without a nacelle model.

augmented reality and connected autonomous vehicles via wide range of wireless
services that span enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), as well as ultra-reliable
low-latency communication (URLLC). Existing wireless systems that solely rely
on the scarce sub-6 GHz, microwave ($\mu$W) frequency bands will be unable to
meet such stringent and mixed service requirements for future wireless services
due to spectrum scarcity. Meanwhile, operating at high-frequency millimeter
wave (mmWave) bands is seen as an attractive solution, primarily due to the
bandwidth availability and possibility of large-scale multi-antenna
communication. However, mmWave communication is inherently unreliable due to
its susceptibility to blockage, high path loss, and channel uncertainty. Hence,
to provide URLLC and high-speed wireless access, it is desirable to seamlessly
integrate the reliability of $\mu$W networks with the high capacity of mmWave
networks. To this end, in this paper, the first comprehensive tutorial for
\emph{integrated mmWave-$\mu$W} communications is introduced. This envisioned
integrated design will enable wireless networks to achieve URLLC along with
eMBB by leveraging the best of two worlds: reliable, long-range communications
at the $\mu$W bands and directional high-speed communications at the mmWave
frequencies. To achieve this goal, key solution concepts are discussed that
include new architectures for the radio interface, URLLC-aware frame structure
and resource allocation methods along with mobility management, to realize the
potential of integrated mmWave-$\mu$W communications. The opportunities and
challenges of each proposed scheme are discussed and key results are presented

the double pulsar, PSR J0737$-$3039. The HTRU-South Low Latitude pulsar survey
represents one of the most sensitive blind pulsar surveys taken of the southern
Galactic plane to date, and its primary aim has been the discovery of new
relativistic binary pulsars. Here we present our binary pulsar searching
strategy and report on the survey's flagship discovery, PSR J1757$-$1854. A
21.5-ms pulsar in a relativistic binary with an orbital period of 4.4 hours and
an eccentricity of 0.61, this double neutron star (DNS) system is the most
accelerated pulsar binary known, and probes a relativistic parameter space not

estimates for single pure component spectra and to calibrate those estimates in
a true, one-at-a-time fashion. This approach allows for minor components to be
targeted and their relative amounts estimated in the presence of other varying
components in spectral data. The use of T-PLS estimation is an improvement to
the BTEM method because it overcomes the need to identify all of the pure
components prior to estimation. Estimated amounts from this combination were
found to be similar to those obtained from a standard method, multivariate
curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS), on a simple, three
component mixture dataset. Studies from two experimental datasets demonstrate
where the combination of BTEM and T-PLS could model the pure component spectra
and obtain concentration profiles of minor components but MCR-ALS could not.

detection, we perform a coherent network analysis taking into account the four

the Stokes $V$ parameter, which directly characterizes the asymmetry of the GW
circular polarization. We find that the amplitude of the GW polarization
becomes bigger for our 3D-GR model that exhibits strong activity of the
standing accretion shock instability (SASI). Our results suggest that the
SASI-induced accretion flows to the proto-neutron star (PNS) lead to a
characteristic, low-frequency modulation (100 $\sim$ 200 Hz) in both the
waveform and the GW circular polarization. During the vigorous SASI phase, we
observe that the GW polarization switches from the right- to left-handed mode,
which is clearly visible in the spectrogram. By estimating the signal-to-noise
ratio of the GW polarization, we demonstrate that the detection horizon of the
circular polarization extends by more than a factor of several times farther

(CR)technology opens the door for the opportunistic use of the licensed

which binary consensus can be solved using any number of instances of the
object and read-write registers. Herlihy [6] showed in his seminal work that if
an object has a consensus number of n, then there is a universal construction
for a wait-free and linearizable implementation of any non-trivial concurrent
object or data structure that is shared among n processes. Thus, a
synchronization object such as compare-and-swap with an infinite consensus
number and the corresponding instruction can be viewed as ""strong"". On the
other hand, a synchronization object such as fetch-and-add with consensus
number two and the corresponding fetch-and-add instruction can be viewed as
""weak"".
  Ellen et al. [2] observed recently that an object supporting two weak
instructions can also achieve infinite consensus number like an object that
supports one strong instruction. Using Herlihy's universal construction, this
implies that ignoring concerns about efficiency, one can design any concurrent
data structure or algorithm using only weak instructions. However, is it
possible that a combination of weak instructions is really powerful enough to
efficiently replace a strong instruction, like compare-and-swap, without
incurring a large overhead in time or space? In this paper, we answer this
question by giving an O(1) time wait-free and linearizable implementation of a
compare-and-swap register shared among n processes using read-write registers
and O(1) registers that support two synchronization primitives half-max and
max-write, each having consensus number one. Thus, any algorithm that solves
some arbitrary synchronization problem using read-write and compare-and-swap

approach introduced has the ability to compute the similarity of predicates
(relations) in ontologies. Given a predicate similarity metric, machine
learning algorithms have been developed for automatic topic discovery and query

K-Means algorithm, a level-by-level optimization strategy was selected for
consistent with the strongly association between elements within a topic.
Automatic query generation was facilitated for discovered topic that could be

customized agents; iii) feedback evaluative machine learning; iv) modeling and
composition of a group of IoT agents; and v) a feature-selection method based
on manual and automatic feedback.

orbital obliquity through the measurement of the RM effect. We used HARPS-N
high-precision radial velocity measurements, gathered during transit events, to
measure the RM effect in the target systems and determine the sky-projected
angle between the planetary orbital plane and the stellar equator. The
characterisation of stellar atmospheric parameters was performed exploiting the
HARPS-N spectra, using line equivalent width ratios, and spectral synthesis
methods. Photometric parameters of the five transiting exoplanets were
re-analysed through 17 new light curves, obtained with an array of medium-class
telescopes, and other light curves from the literature. Survey-time-series
photometric data were analysed for determining the rotation periods of the five
stars and their spin inclination. From the analysis of the RM effect we derived
a sky-projected obliquity of 21.2 degree, -54 degree, -2.1 degree, 0 degree and
-129 degree for HAT-P-3b, HAT-P-12b, HAT-P-22b, WASP-39b and WASP-60b,

retrograde orbit. These values represent the first measurements of \lambda for
the five exoplanetary systems under study. The stellar activity of HAT-P-22
indicates a rotation period of 28.7 days, which allowed us to estimate the true
misalignment angle of HAT-P-22b, \psi=24 degree. The revision of the physical
parameters of the five exoplanetary systems returned values that are fully
compatible with those existing in the literature. The exception to this is the
WASP-60 system, for which, based on higher quality spectroscopic and

the past decade were all triggered by the discovery of the Z$_2$ topological
insulator (TI). In three dimensions (3D), the TI is classified as either
""strong"" or ""weak"", and experimental confirmations of the strong topological
insulator (STI) rapidly followed the theoretical predictions. In contrast, the
weak topological insulator has so far eluded experimental verification, since
the topological surface states emerge only on particular side surfaces which
are typically undetectable in real 3D crystals. Here we provide experimental
evidence for the WTI state in a bismuth iodide, $\beta$-Bi4I4. Significantly,
the crystal has naturally cleavable top and side planes both stacked via
van-der-Waals forces, which have long been desirable for the experimental
realization of the WTI state. As a definitive signature of it, we find quasi-1D
Dirac TSS at the side-surface (100) while the top-surface (001) is
topologically dark. Furthermore, a crystal transition from the $\beta$- to
$\alpha$-phase drives a topological phase transition from a nontrivial WTI to
the trivial insulator around room temperature. This topological phase, viewed
as quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators stacked three-dimensionally, and
excellent functionality with on/off switching will lay a foundation for new
technology benefiting from highly directional spin-currents with large density
protected against backscattering.

investigate ground-state and dynamical properties of the anisotropic Kondo

MPS-based methods with several orders of magnitude fewer variational parameters

maximal. We identify the CF's quantum numbers as the angular momentum L in (L_e
L_v)L, its magnetic projection m_L, the electron number N, with L_v={N-1)/2,

show that this wave function has an exactly equivalent hierarchical form.
  FQHE states can be grouped into \nu-spin multiplets mirror symmetric around
m_\nu=0, with N held constant. Electron particle-hole conjugation with respect
to this vacuum is identified as the mirror symmetry relating FQHE states of the

  Alternatively, mirror symmetric \nu-spin multiplets can be constructed in

electron particle-vortex hole excitations. Particle-hole symmetry -- relating
the N-particle FQHE state of filling \nu=p/(2p+1} to the $\bar{N}$-particle
state of filling {p+1)/(2p+1} -- is shown to be equivalent to electron-vortex
exchange.
  In this construction $\bar{N}$-N CFs of the higher density state occupy an
extra zero-mode subshell. We link this structure, familiar from supersymmetric
quantum mechanics, to the CF Pauli Hamiltonian, which we show is isospectral,
quadratic in the \nu-spin raising and lowering operators, and four-fold
degenerate. On linearization, it takes a Dirac form similar to that found in
the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE).

approach to trade computing power to reduce the communication load in general
distributed computing frameworks such as MapReduce. In particular, Li et al.
show that increasing the computation load in the Map phase by a factor of $r$
can create coded multicasting opportunities to reduce the communication load in
the Reduce phase by the same factor. However, there are two major limitations
in practice. First, it requires an exponentially large number of input files
(data batches) when the number of computing nodes gets large. Second, it forces
every $s$ computing nodes to compute one Map function, which leads to a large
number of Map functions required to achieve the promised gain. In this paper,
we make an attempt to overcome these two limitations by proposing a novel coded
distributed computing approach based on a combinatorial design. We demonstrate
that when the number of computing nodes becomes large, 1) the proposed approach
requires an exponentially less number of input files; 2) the required number of
Map functions is also reduced exponentially. Meanwhile, the resulting
computation-communication trade-off maintains the multiplicative gain compared

A drawback of GPC+ is that it requires numerical quadrature to calculate the

time-consuming. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel classification
method with privileged information based on Gaussian processes, called
""soft-label-transferred Gaussian process (SLT-GP)."" Our basic idea is that we
construct another learning task of predicting soft labels (continuous values)
obtained from privileged information and we perform transfer learning from this
task to the target task of predicting hard labels. We derive a PAC-Bayesian
bound of our proposed method, which justifies optimizing hyperparameters by the
empirical Bayes method. We also experimentally show the usefulness of our

recommended in the literature because of its strong control of familywise error
rate. However, this method is developed only for one-way layouts and randomized
complete blocks. By combining the method of aligned ranks and pairwise ranking,
we extend the Steel-Dwass pairwise comparisons to the analysis of covariance

testing for treatment versus control. Unlike the traditional two-sample
standardization of test statistics, we propose a weighted estimate of the scale
parameter for ranks and show through simulation that it has superior small
sample performance by controlling the familywise error rate at nominal level.
This method provides an improvement for large sample approximation of
Steel-Dwass method for one-way layouts. The marginal and joint asymptotic
distributions are derived and power comparisons are made with the method of

DNNs without sacrificing accuracy. We replace a dense matrix with products of
sparse matrices whose topologies we pick in advance. This allows us to: (1)
train significantly smaller networks without a loss in accuracy, and (2) store
the network weights without having to store connection indices. We therefore
achieve significant training speedups due to the smaller network size, and a
reduced amount of computation per epoch. We tested several sparse layer
topologies and found that Clos networks perform well due to their high path
diversity, shallowness, and high model accuracy. With the ClosNets, we are able
to reduce dense layer sizes by as much as an order of magnitude without hurting
model accuracy.

interaction values. We propose a rich visualization of individualized feature

formalize two properties of proper, lower semi-continuous and semi-algebraic
sets: the three-point property for all possible iterates and the local
contraction property that serves as the non-expensiveness property of the
projector but only for the iterates that are close enough to each other. Then
by exploiting the geometric properties of the objective function around its

the iterates generated by alternating projection method is a convergent
sequence and converges to a critical point. We complete this study by providing
convergence rate which depends on the explicit expression of the KL exponent.
As a byproduct, we use our new analysis framework to recover the linear
convergence rate of alternating projection method onto closed convex sets. To
illustrate the power of our new framework, we provide new convergence result

scattering channel leading to re-emission of H$\alpha$, alternating their
identities between Ly$\beta$ and H$\alpha$. In this work, we develop a Monte
Carlo code to simulate the transfer of Ly$\beta$ line photons incorporating the
scattering channel into H$\alpha$. Both H$\alpha$ and Ly$\beta$ lines are
formed through diffusion in frequency space, where a line photon enters the
wing regime after a fairly large number of resonance scatterings with hydrogen
atoms. Various line profiles of H$\alpha$ and Ly$\beta$ emergent from our model
nebulae are presented. It is argued that the electron temperature is a critical
parameter which controls the flux ratio of emergent Ly$\beta$ and H$\alpha$.
Specifically for $T=3 \times 10^4{\rm\ K}$ and H$\alpha$ line center optical
depth $\tau_\alpha=10$, the number flux ratio of emergent Ly$\beta$ and

leaking Ly$\beta$ can be an interesting source for the formation of H$\alpha$

broad H$\alpha$ wings are also expected in Ly$\alpha$ emitting halos found in

applications such as rotation sensing, highly coherent optical communications,
and low-noise microwave signal synthesis. Remark- ably, when implemented at the
chip-scale, recent experimental studies have revealed that Brillouin lasers can
operate in the fundamental linewidth regime where optomechanical and quantum
noise sources dominate. To explore new opportunities for enhanced performance,
we formulate a simple model to describe the physics of cascaded Brillouin
lasers based on the coupled mode dynamics governed by electrostriction and the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem. From this model, we obtain analytical formulas
describing the steady state power evolution and accompanying noise properties,
including expressions for phase noise, relative intensity noise and power
spectra for beat notes of cascaded laser orders. Our analysis reveals that
cascading modifies the dynamics of intermediate laser orders, yielding noise
properties that differ from single-mode Brillouin lasers. These modifications
lead to a Stokes order linewidth dependency on the coupled order dynamics and a
broader linewidth than that predicted with previous single order theories. We
also derive a simple analytical expression for the higher order beat notes that
enables calculation of the Stokes linewidth based on only the relative measured
powers between orders instead of absolute parameters, yielding a method to
measure cascaded order linewidth as well as a prediction for sub-Hz operation.
We validate our results using stochastic numerical simulations of the cascaded
laser dynamics.

go towards heavy mass region due to isospin mixing caused by the growing
Coulomb forces. However, it was realized quite early that isospin could become
an important and useful quantum number for all nuclei including heavy nuclei
due to neutron richness of the systems~\cite{robson}. Lane and
Soper~\cite{lane} also showed in a theoretical calculation that isospin indeed
remains quite good in heavy mass neutron rich systems. In this paper, we
present isospin based calculations~\cite{jain,swati} for the fission fragment
distributions obtained from heavy-ion fusion fission reactions. We discuss in
detail the procedure adopted to assign the isospin values and the role of
neutron multiplicity data in obtaining the total fission fragment
distributions. We show that the observed fragment distributions can be
reproduced rather reasonably well by the calculations based on the idea of
conservation of isospin. This is probably the very first direct experimental
evidence of the validity of isospin in heavy nuclei, which arises largely due
to the neutron-rich nature of heavy nuclei and their fragments. This result may
eventually become useful for the theories of nuclear fission and also in other
practical applications.

radio. However, the sampling rate is still a bottleneck of WSS. Several
sub-Nyquist sensing methods have been proposed. These technologies deteriorate
in the low signal to noise ratio (SNR) regime or suffer high computational
complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel sub-Nyquist WSS method based on
Multi-coset (MC) sampling. We design a simple SNR-robust and low-complexity
multiband signal detection algorithm. In particular, the proposed method
differs the commonly used detection algorithms which are based on energy
detection (ED), matched filter (MF) or cyclostationary detection (CD). We
exploit the linear recurrent relation between the locations of nonzero
frequencies and the DFT of the arithmetic-shifted subsampled signals. These
relations can be uniquely expressed by a series of the so-called frequency
locator polynomials (FLPs). The scalar of the relations is related to the
bandwidths of the subsignals. Basing on this, we propose a detector for sparse
multiband signals along with the method estimating carrier frequency and
bandwidth. The detector does not require priori knowledge about the frequency
locations of the signals of interest. Moreover, it has lower complexity of both
samples and computation compared to CD in sparse case. Experimental results
show the detector outperforms ED in the sub-Nyquist regime especially in low
SNRs.

large-scale and heterogeneous wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and Internet of

reliable downward routing protocol for WSNs/IoT. OSR introduces opportunistic
routing into traditional source routing based on the parent set of a node's
upward routing in data collection, significantly addressing the drastic link
dynamics in low-power and lossy WSNs. We devise a novel adaptive Bloom filter
mechanism to effectively and efficiently encode a downward source-route in OSR,
which enables a significant reduction of the length of source-route field in
packet header. OSR is scalable to very large-size WSN/IoT deployments, since
each resource-constrained node in the network only stores the set of its direct
children. The probabilistic nature of the Bloom filter passively explores
opportunistic routing. Upon a delivery failure at any hop along the downward
path, OSR actively performs opportunistic routing to bypass the obsolete/bad
link. We demonstrate the desirable scalability of OSR against the standard RPL
downward routing. We evaluate the performance of OSR via both simulations and
real-world testbed experiments, in comparison with the standard RPL (both
storing mode and non-storing mode), ORPL, and the representative dissemination
protocol Drip. Our results show that OSR significantly outperforms RPL and ORPL
in scalability and reliability. OSR also achieves significantly better energy
efficiency compared to TinyRPL and Drip which are based on the same TinyOS

all vertices arrive online. On the arrival of a vertex, its incident edges to
previously-arrived vertices are revealed. Each vertex has a deadline that is
after all its neighbors' arrivals. If a vertex remains unmatched until its
deadline, the algorithm must then irrevocably either match it to an unmatched
neighbor, or leave it unmatched. The model generalizes the existing one-sided
online model and is motivated by applications including ride-sharing platforms,
real-estate agency, etc.
  We show that the Ranking algorithm by Karp et al. (STOC 1990) is
$0.5211$-competitive in our fully online model for general graphs. Our analysis
brings a novel charging mechanic into the randomized primal dual technique by
Devanur et al. (SODA 2013), allowing a vertex other than the two endpoints of a
matched edge to share the gain. To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of
Ranking that beats $0.5$ on general graphs in an online matching problem, a
first step towards solving the open problem by Karp et al. (STOC 1990) about
the optimality of Ranking on general graphs. If the graph is bipartite, we show
that the competitive ratio of Ranking is between $0.5541$ and $0.5671$.

operators that act on an internal coin space, each projector is associated with

to the requirement that the continuum limit of the walk is fully Lorentz

symmetry requirement necessitates that inclusion of antimatter---the use of a
four-dimensional internal space---and that the ""coin flip"" operation is
generated by the parity transformation on the internal coin space, while the
differences of the projection operators associated to each dimension must all

that these can produce a surprisingly large phase shift between the two arms of

size of this phase shift for a particular model, the 3D quantum walk on the

equation in the continuum limit. Though the details of this model will affect
the size of the shift, its magnitude is set largely by dimensional analysis, so
there is reason to believe that other models would yield similar results. We

technological applications due to their unique properties and functionalities.
Many experimental and theoretical research groups across the globe have made
outstanding contributions to benchmark the properties of graphene/MoS$_2$
heterostructures. Even though some research groups have already made an attempt
to model the graphene/MoS$_2$ heterostructures using {\it first-principles}
calculations, there exists several discrepancies in the results from different
theoretical research groups and the experimental findings. In the present work,
we revisit this problem by first principles approach and address the existing
discrepancies about the interlayer spacing between graphene and MoS$_2$
monolayers in graphene/MoS$_2$ heterostructures, and the location of Dirac
points near Fermi-level. We find that the Tkatchenko--Scheffler method
efficiently evaluates the long-range vdW interactions and accurately predicts
interlayer spacing between graphene and MoS$_2$ sheets. We further investigate
the electronic, mechanical and vibrational properties of the optimized
graphene/MoS$_2$ heterostructures created using 5$\times$5/4$\times$4 and
4$\times$4/3$\times$3 supercell geometries having different magnitudes of
lattice mismatch. The effect of the varying interlayer spacing on the
electronic properties of heterostructures is discussed. Our phonon calculations
reveal that the interlayer shear and breathing phonon modes, which are very
sensitive to the weak vdW interactions, play vital role in describing the
thermal properties of the studied systems. The thermodynamic and elastic
properties of heterostructures are further discussed. A comparison between our
results and the results reported from other research groups is presented.

challenges, resulting in increased dependence on complex mechanisms for
automated test case selection and prioritization as part of a continuous

refer to such test cases as test agents. The model that underlie a test agent
is capable of flexible and autonomous actions in order to meet overall testing
objectives. Our goal is to increase the decentralization of regression testing
by letting test agents to know for themselves when they should be executing,
how they should update their purpose, and when they should interact with each

adaptive autonomous behavior. Emerging developments and challenges regarding
the use of test agents are explored-in particular, new research that seeks to

simulation results from Guo 2013 and Henriques 2015 to study two aspects of the
co-evolution, \emph{i.e.} the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background
generated by SMBH merger and the SMBH/galaxy clustering. The characteristic
strain amplitude of GW background predicted by Guo 2013 and Henriques 2015
models are $A_{yr^{-1}}=5.00\times10^{-16}$ and
$A_{yr^{-1}}=9.42\times10^{-17}$, respectively. We find the GW amplitude is
very sensitive to the galaxy merger rate. The difference in the galaxy merger
rate between Guo 2013 and Henriques 2015, results in a factor $5$ deviation in
the GW strain amplitude. For clusterings, we calculate the spatially isotropic
two point auto- and cross-correlation functions (2PCFs) for both SMBHs and
galaxies by using the mock catalogs generated from Guo 2013 model. We find that
all 2PCFs have positive dependence on both SMBH and galaxy mass. And there
exist a significant time evolution in 2PCFs, namely, the clustering effect is
enhanced at lower redshifts. Interestingly, this result is not reported in the
active galactic nuclei samples in SDSS. Our analysis also shows that, roughly,
SMBHs and galaxies, with galaxy mass $10^2\sim10^3$ larger than SMBH mass, have
similar pattern of clustering, which is a reflection of the co-evolution of
SMBH and galaxy. Finally, we calculate the first ten multiples of the angular
power spectrum of the energy density of GW background. We find the amplitude of
angular power spectrum of the first ten multiples is about $10\%$ to $60\%$ of
the monopole component in the whole frequency range.

success in the field of object detection. The existing R-CNNs usually divide a
Region-of-Interest (ROI) into grids, and then localize objects by utilizing the
spatial information reflected by the relative position of each grid in the ROI.
In this paper, we propose a novel feature-encoding approach, where spatial
information is represented through the spatial distributions of visual
patterns. In particular, we design a Mask Weight Network (MWN) to learn a set
of masks and then apply channel-wise masking operations to ROI feature map,
followed by a global pooling and a cheap fully-connected layer. We integrate
the newly designed feature encoder into the Faster R-CNN architecture. The
resulting new Faster R-CNNs can preserve the object-detection accuracy of the
standard Faster R-CNNs by using substantially fewer parameters. Compared to
R-FCNs using state-of-art PS ROI pooling and deformable PS ROI pooling, the new
Faster R-CNNs can produce higher object-detection accuracy with good run-time
efficiency. We also show that a specifically designed and learned MWN can
capture global contextual information and further improve the object-detection
accuracy. Validation experiments are conducted on both PASCAL VOC and MS COCO
datasets.

and documents are returned in order of relevance to the given query; this can
be cast as a multi-label ranking problem in machine learning. Generally, the
number of candidate documents is extremely large (from several thousand to
several million); thus, the classifier must handle many labels. This problem is
referred to as extreme multi-label classification (XMLC). In this paper, we
propose a novel approach to XMLC termed the Sparse Weighted Nearest-Neighbor
Method. This technique can be derived as a fast implementation of
state-of-the-art (SOTA) one-versus-rest linear classifiers for very sparse

generalization of a representer theorem with a linear kernel. Furthermore, our
method can be viewed as the vector space model used in IR. Finally, we show
that the Sparse Weighted Nearest-Neighbor Method can process data points in
real time on XMLC datasets with equivalent performance to SOTA models, with a
single thread and smaller storage footprint. In particular, our method exhibits
superior performance to the SOTA models on a dataset with 3 million labels.

excursion-construction of SLE$_\kappa(\kappa-6)$ processes in the continuum and
we are thus led to introduce suitable cut-off stopping times in order to
analyse the behaviour of the driving function of the discrete system when
Dobrushin boundary condition collapses to a single point. Our proof is very
different from [KS15, KS16] as it only relies on the convergence to the chordal
SLE$_{\kappa}$ process in Dobrushin boundary condition and does not require the
introduction of a new observable. Still, it relies crucially on several
ingredients:
  a) the powerful topological framework developed in [KS17] as well as its
follow-up paper [CDCH$^+$14],
  b) the strong RSW Theorem from [CDCH16],
  c) the proof is inspired from the appendix A in [BH16].
  One important emphasis of this paper is to carefully write down some
properties which are often considered {\em folklore} in the literature but
which are only justified so far by hand-waving arguments. The main examples of
these are:
  1) the convergence of natural discrete stopping times to their continuous
analogues. (The usual hand-waving argument destroys the spatial Markov
property).
  2) the fact that the discrete spatial Markov property is preserved in the the
scaling limit. (The enemy being that $\mathbb{E}[X_n |\, Y_n]$ does not
necessarily converge to $\mathbb{E}[X|\, Y]$ when $(X_n,Y_n)\to (X,Y)$).
  We end the paper with a detailed sketch of the convergence to radial

has shown that in the case of regularly-spaced interacting monomers this chain
can fold into structures characterized by multiple distinct domains of

the entropy cost of forming loops. We show by advanced replica-exchange

further stabilizes these domains. The model suggests that the partitioning of

behaviors are adopted in a population. These models typically lead to a
continuous or a discontinuous phase transition of the number of adopters as a
function of a control parameter. We explore a simple model of social adoption
where the agents can be in two states, either adopters or non-adopters, and can
switch between these two states interacting with other agents through a
network. The probability of an agent to switch from non-adopter to adopter
depends on the number of adopters in her network neighborhood, the adoption
threshold $T$ and the adoption coefficient $a$, two parameters defining a Hill
function. In contrast, the transition from adopter to non-adopter is
spontaneous at a certain rate $\mu$. In a mean-field approach, we derive the
governing ordinary differential equations and show that the nature of the
transition between the global non-adoption and global adoption regimes depends
mostly on the balance between the probability to adopt with one and two
adopters. The transition changes from continuous, via a transcritical
bifurcation, to discontinuous, via a combination of a saddle-node and a
transcritical bifurcation, through a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. We
characterize the full parameter space. Finally, we compare our analytical
results with Montecarlo simulations on annealed and quenched degree regular
networks, showing a better agreement for the annealed case. Our results show
how a simple model is able to capture two seemingly very different types of
transitions, i.e., continuous and discontinuous and thus unifies underlying
dynamics for different systems. Furthermore the form of the adoption
probability used here is based on empirical measurements.

networks by means of the Information Content metric. As opposed to other
approaches, as for instance the use of global overlap or entropies, the
proposed one allows to understand if the observed changes are due to random
noise, or to structural (targeted) modifications. We validate the framework by
means of sets of synthetic networks, as well as networks representing real
technological, social and biological evolving systems. We further propose a way
of reconstructing network correlograms, which allow to convert the system's
evolution to the frequency domain.

one hand, even hoppings break particle-hole and sublattice symmetry, making the
system topologically trivial, but the Zak phase is still quantized due to the
presence of inversion symmetry. On the other hand, odd hoppings allow for
phases with a larger topological invariant. This implies that the system

unusual type II-P supernova iPTF14hls. Instead of a ~100-day plateau as
observed for ordinary type II-P supernovae, the light curve of iPTF14hls has at
least five distinct peaks, followed by a steep decline at ~1000 days since
discovery. Until 500 days since discovery, the effective temperature of
iPTF14hls is roughly constant at 5000-6000K . In this paper we propose that
iPTF14hls is likely powered by intermittent fallback accretion. It is found
that the light curve of iPTF14hls can be well fit by the usual t^{-5/3}
accretion law until ~1000 days post discovery when the light curve transitions
to a steep decline. To account for this steep decline, we suggest a power-law
density profile for the late accreted material, rather than the constant
profile as appropriated for the t^{-5/3} accretion law. Detailed modeling
indicates that the total fallback mass is ~0.2M_{sun}, with an ejecta mass
M_{ej}~21M_{sun}. We find the third peak of the light curve cannot be well fit
by the fallback model, indicating that there could be some extra rapid energy
injection. We suggest that this extra energy injection may be a result of a
magnetic outburst if the central object is a neutron star. These results
indicate that the progenitor of iPTF14hls could be a massive red supergiant.

we modify the de-wiggled BAO model with an additional parameter to describe
both the BAO peak and the underlying exclusion pattern of void 2PCFs. We show
that after applying BAO reconstruction to galaxies, the BAO peak scale of both
galaxies and voids are unbiased using the modified model. Furthermore, we use a
new 2PCF estimator for a multi-tracer analysis with galaxies and voids. In
simulations, the joint sample improves by about 10% the constraint for the
post-reconstruction BAO peak position compared to the result from galaxies
alone, which is equivalent to an enlargement of the survey volume by 20%.
Applying this method to the BOSS DR12 data, we have an 18% improvement for the
low-z sample (0.2<z<0.5), but a worse constraint for the high-z sample

transmitters are synchronous among themselves but are not synchronized with the
receiver. In quasi-synchronous VLP systems, position estimation can be
performed by utilizing time difference of arrival (TDOA) information together
with channel attenuation information, leading to a hybrid localization system.
To specify accuracy limits for quasi-synchronous VLP systems, the Cramer-Rao
lower bound (CRLB) on position estimation is derived in a generic
three-dimensional scenario. Then, a direct positioning approach is adopted to
obtain the maximum likelihood (ML) position estimator based directly on
received signals from LED transmitters. In addition, a two-step position
estimator is proposed, where TDOA and received signal strength (RSS) estimates
are obtained in the first step and the position estimation is performed, based
on the TDOA and RSS estimates, in the second step. The performance of the
two-step positioning technique is shown to converge to that of direct
positioning at high signal-to-noise ratios based on asymptotic properties of ML

Moreover, we search for companion candidates, possibly connected to the disk.
We obtained high-contrast and high angular resolution data in the near-infrared

the planet formation by detecting and characterizing these planets and their
formation environments through direct imaging. We performed polarimetric
imaging of the RY~Lup disk with IRDIS (at 1.6 microns), and obtained intensity

spectro-imager (0.9-1.3 microns). We resolved for the first time the scattered

separations in the 100 \,au range. The shape of the disk and its sharp features

This interpretation is supported by in-depth numerical simulations. We also

studies focus on domain-specific classification algorithms which may not be

signal-to-noise ratio and can be easily corrupted. In this regard, we propose a
generic EEG signal classification framework that accommodates a wide range of
applications to address the aforementioned issues. The proposed framework
develops a reinforced selective attention model to automatically choose the
distinctive information among the raw EEG signals. A convolutional mapping
operation is employed to dynamically transform the selected information to an
over-complete feature space, wherein implicit spatial dependency of EEG samples
distribution is able to be uncovered. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework using three representative scenarios: intention recognition
with motor imagery EEG, person identification, and neurological diagnosis.
Three widely used public datasets and a local dataset are used for our
evaluation. The experiments show that our framework outperforms the
state-of-the-art baselines and achieves the accuracy of more than 97% on all
the datasets with low latency and good resilience of handling complex EEG

their embedding. GEMSEC is a general extension of earlier work in the domain of
sequence-based graph embedding. GEMSEC places nodes in an abstract feature
space where the vertex features minimize the negative log-likelihood of
preserving sampled vertex neighborhoods, and it incorporates known social
network properties through a machine learning regularization. We present two
new social network datasets and show that by simultaneously considering the
embedding and clustering problems with respect to social properties, GEMSEC
extracts high-quality clusters competitive with or superior to other community
detection algorithms. In experiments, the method is found to be computationally
efficient and robust to the choice of hyperparameters.

separated by more than 0.6 AU in heliocentric distance, less than 4{\deg} in
heliographic longitude, and less than 7{\deg} in heliographic latitude. Both
ICMEs took around 2 days to travel between the spacecraft. The ICME B-field
profiles observed by MESSENGER have been mapped to the heliocentric distance of
STEREO-B and compared directly to the profiles observed by STEREO-B. Figures
that result from this mapping allow for easy qualitative assessment of
similarity in the profiles. Macroscale features in the profiles that varied on
timescales of 1 hour, and which corresponded to the underlying flux rope
structure of the ICMEs, were well correlated in the solar east-west and
north-south directions, with Pearson's correlation coefficients of around 0.85
and 0.95, respectively; microscale features with timescales of 1 minute were
uncorrelated. Overall correlation values in the profiles of one ICME were
increased when an apparent change in the flux rope axis direction between the
observing spacecraft was taken into account. The high degree of similarity seen
in the B-field profiles may be interpreted in in two ways. If the spacecraft
sampled the same region of each ICME (i.e. if the spacecraft angular
separations can be neglected), the similarity indicates that there was little
evolution in the underlying structure of the sampled region during propagation.
Alternatively, if the spacecraft observed different, nearby regions within the
ICMEs, it indicates that there was spatial homogeneity across those different
regions. The field structure similarity observed in these ICMEs points to the
value of placing in situ space weather monitors well upstream of the Earth.

  Crowdsourcing",,,,,"cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  The questions in a crowdsourcing task typically exhibit varying degrees of
difficulty and subjectivity. Their joint effects give rise to the variation in
responses to the same question by different crowd-workers. This variation is
low when the question is easy to answer and objective, and high when it is
difficult and subjective. Unfortunately, current quality control methods for
crowdsourcing consider only the question difficulty to account for the
variation. As a result,these methods cannot distinguish workers personal
preferences for different correct answers of a partially subjective question
from their ability/expertise to avoid objectively wrong answers for that
question. To address this issue, we present a probabilistic model which (i)
explicitly encodes question difficulty as a model parameter and (ii) implicitly
encodes question subjectivity via latent preference factors for crowd-workers.
We show that question subjectivity induces grouping of crowd-workers, revealed
through clustering of their latent preferences. Moreover, we develop a
quantitative measure of the subjectivity of a question. Experiments show that
our model(1) improves the performance of both quality control for crowd-sourced
answers and next answer prediction for crowd-workers,and (2) can potentially
provide coherent rankings of questions in terms of their difficulty and
subjectivity, so that task providers can refine their designs of the
crowdsourcing tasks, e.g. by removing highly subjective questions or
inappropriately difficult questions.

regions, are understood to be the coronal manifestation of thermal
non-equilibrium (TNE). The active regions previously studied with EIT/SOHO and
AIA/SDO indicated that long-period intensity pulsations are localized in only
one or two loop bundles. The basic idea of this study is to understand why. For
this purpose, we tested the response of different loop systems, using different
magnetic configurations, to different stratifications and strengths of the
heating. We present an extensive parameter-space study using 1D hydrodynamic
simulations (1,020 in total) and conclude that the occurrence of TNE requires
specific combinations of parameters. Our study shows that the TNE cycles are
confined to specific ranges in parameter space. This naturally explains why
only some loops undergo constant periodic pulsations over several days: since
the loop geometry and the heating properties generally vary from one loop to
another in an active region, only the ones in which these parameters are
compatible exhibits TNE cycles. Furthermore, these parameters (heating and
geometry) are likely to vary significantly over the duration of a cycle, which
potentially limits the possibilities of periodic behavior. This study also
confirms that long-period intensity pulsations and coronal rain are two aspects
of the same phenomenon: both phenomena can occur for similar heating conditions
and can appear simultaneously in the simulations.

in a mechanical resistance which is long-lived but finite, as ultimately cracks

systematically surrounded by equatorial disks and slow outflows. Although the
rotating dynamics had only been well identified in three cases, the study of
such structures is thought to be fundamental to the understanding of the
formation of nebulae around evolved stars. We present ALMA maps of 12CO and
13CO J=3-2 lines in one of these sources, IRAS08544-4431. We analyzed the data
by means of nebula models, which account for the expectedly composite source
and can reproduce the data. From our modeling, we estimated the main nebula
parameters, including the structure and dynamics and the density and
temperature distributions. We discuss the uncertainties of the derived values
and, in particular, their dependence on the distance.
  Our observations reveal the presence of an equatorial disk in rotation; a
low-velocity outflow is also found, probably formed of gas expelled from the
disk. The main characteristics of our observations and modeling of
IRAS08544-4431 are similar to those of better studied objects, confirming our
interpretation. The disk rotation indicates a total central mass of about 1.8
Mo, for a distance of 1100 pc. The disk is found to be relatively extended and
has a typical diameter of ~ 4 10^16 cm. The total nebular mass is ~ 2 10^-2 Mo,
of which ~ 90% corresponds to the disk. Assuming that the outflow is due to
mass loss from the disk, we derive a disk lifetime of ~ 10000 yr. The disk
angular momentum is found to be comparable to that of the binary system at
present. Assuming that the disk angular momentum was transferred from the
binary system, as expected, the high values of the disk angular momentum in
this and other similar disks suggest that the size of the stellar orbits has
significantly decreased as a consequence of disk formation.

evolution driven by dust production in stellar ejecta, dust destruction by
sputtering, grain growth by accretion and coagulation, and grain disruption by
shattering, and treat small and large grains separately to trace the grain size
distribution. After confirming that our model nicely reproduces the observed
relation between dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity for nearby galaxies, we
concentrate on the dust abundance over the cosmological volume in this paper.
The comoving dust mass density has a peak at redshift $z\sim 1$--2, coincident
with the observationally suggested dustiest epoch in the Universe. {In the
local Universe}, roughly 10 per cent of the dust is contained in the
intergalactic medium (IGM), where only 1/3--1/4 of the dust survives against
dust destruction by sputtering. We also show that the dust mass function is
roughly reproduced at $\lesssim 10^8$ M$_\odot$, while the massive end still
has a discrepancy, which indicates {the necessity of stronger feedback in
massive galaxies}. %%The relation showed that accretion is essential for dusty
galaxies. In addition, our model broadly reproduces the observed radial profile
of dust surface density in the circum-galactic medium (CGM). While our model
satisfies the observational constraints for the dust extinction {on
cosmological scales}, it predicts that the dust in the CGM and IGM is dominated
by large ($> 0.03~\mu$m) grains, which is in tension with the steep reddening

categories. The main approach to performing text categorization is learning
from labeled examples. For many tasks, it may be difficult to find examples in

or more languages and classifying (categorizing) in another is called
cross-lingual learning. In this work, we present a novel approach that solves
the general cross-lingual text categorization problem. Our method generates,
for each training document, a set of language-independent features. Using these
features for training yields a language-independent classifier. At the
classification stage, we generate language-independent features for the
unlabeled document, and apply the classifier on the new representation.
  To build the feature generator, we utilize a hierarchical
language-independent ontology, where each concept has a set of support
documents for each language involved. In the preprocessing stage, we use the
support documents to build a set of language-independent feature generators,
one for each language. The collection of these generators is used to map any
document into the language-independent feature space.
  Our methodology works on the most general cross-lingual text categorization
problems, being able to learn from any mix of languages and classify documents
in any other language. We also present a method for exploiting the hierarchical
structure of the ontology to create virtual supporting documents for languages
that do not have them. We tested our method, using Wikipedia as our ontology,
on the most commonly used test collections in cross-lingual text
categorization, and found that it outperforms existing methods.

non-stationarity of the functional connectivity due to unknown temporal changes
in the network, (b) sparsity of the time-series of events that limits the
effectiveness of classical correlation-based analysis, and (c) lack of an
explicit model describing how events propagate through the network. Under the
assumption that the probability of two nodes being functionally connected
correlates with the mean delay between their respective events, we develop an
inference method whose output is an undirected weighted network where the
weight of an edge between two nodes denotes the probability of these nodes
being functionally connected. Using a combination of windowing and convolution
to calculate at each time window a score quantifying the likelihood of a pair
of nodes emitting events in quick succession, we develop a model of

observables. Actually, assuming $s$ derivatives with $s < d/2$ ($d$ the
dimension) ensures an optimal rate of convergence of $1/\sqrt{n}$ ($n$ the
number of samples). The method is flexible enough to apply to Markov chains
which satisfy a geometric contraction hypothesis, assuming neither stationarity
nor reversibility, with the same convergence speed up to a power of logarithm
factor. Our results are stated as controls of the expected distance between the
empirical measure and its limit, but we explain briefly how the classical
method of bounded difference can be used to deduce concentration estimates.

of the radio network and takes advantage of the most important key features
proposed for 5G. It extends the well-known idea of passive radar (also known as
passive coherent location, PCL) by introducing cooperative principles. These
range from cooperative, synchronous radio signaling, and MAC up to radar data
fusion on sensor and scenario levels. By using software-defined radio and
network paradigms, as well as real-time mobile edge computing facilities
intended for 5G, CPCL promises to become a ubiquitous radar service which may
be adaptive, reconfigurable, and perhaps cognitive. As CPCL makes double use of
radio resources (both in terms of frequency bands and hardware), it can be
considered a green technology. Although we introduce the CPCL idea from the
viewpoint of vehicle-to-vehicle/infrastructure (V2X) communication, it can
definitely also be applied to many other applications in industry, transport,
logistics, and for safety and security applications.

suggest that HIX galaxies are HI-rich because they can support more HI against

their halo. The HI content of HIX galaxies might be further increased by
gas-rich minor mergers. This paper is based on data obtained with the Australia

states. This intuitive belief underlies most physics-inspired strategies for

not always justified. Specifically, we employ the cavity method to analyze the
minimum strong defensive alliance problem and discover a bifurcation in the
solution space, induced by an inflection point in the entropy--energy profile.
While easily accessible configurations are associated with the
lower-free-energy branch, the low-energy configurations are associated with the
higher-free-energy branch within the same temperature range. There is a
discontinuous phase transition between the high-energy configurations and the
ground states, which generally cannot be followed by SA. We introduce an
energy-clamping strategy to obtain superior solutions by following the
higher-free-energy branch, overcoming the limitations of SA.

relies on projecting all quantum states onto a restricted subset using a fixed

then be evaluated using a simplified optimisation, with the result providing
lower bounds on the resource contents of any state. This approach also reduces
the experimental overhead, requiring only the relevant statistics of the
restricted family of states. We illustrate the application of our framework by
focusing on the resource of multiqubit entanglement and outline applications to
other quantum resources.

properties and similarity to the background influence whether (and how fast)

searchers adjust the dynamics of their eye movements (e.g., fixation durations,
saccade amplitudes) to the target they search for. In our experiment
participants searched natural scenes for six artificial targets with different
spatial frequency throughout eight consecutive sessions. High-spatial frequency
targets led to smaller saccade amplitudes and shorter fixation durations than
low-spatial frequency targets if target identity was known before the trial. If
a saccade was programmed in the same direction as the previous saccade
(saccadic momentum), fixation durations and successive saccade amplitudes were
not influenced by target type. Visual saliency and empirical density at the
endpoints of saccadic momentum saccades were comparatively low, indicating that
these saccades were less selective. Our results demonstrate that searchers
adjust their eye movement dynamics to the search target in a sensible fashion,
since low-spatial frequencies are visible farther into the periphery than
high-spatial frequencies. Additionally, the saccade direction specificity of
our effects suggests a separation of saccades into a default scanning mechanism
and a selective, target-dependent mechanism.

shortcomings of generative models such as mode collapse, we augment our

show that even an untrained structured (convolutional) generative networks acts

type fractional difference sequence spaces via Euler gamma function. Although
we characterize compactness conditions on those spaces using the main tools of
Hausdorff measure of noncompactness, we can only obtain sufficient conditions
when the final space is $\ell _{\infty }$. However, we use some recent results
to exactly characterize the classes of compact matrix operators when the final
space is the set of bounded sequences.

Bose-selected states, whose occupations increase linearly with the total
particle number, and the group of all other states whose occupations saturate

operates implicitly on a Hessenberg, Hessenberg pencil instead of on a
Hessenberg, triangular pencil. Whereas the QZ method performs nested subspace
iteration driven by a polynomial, the rational QZ method allows for nested
subspace iteration driven by a rational function, this creates the additional
freedom of selecting poles. In this article we study Hessenberg, Hessenberg
pencils, link them to rational Krylov subspaces, propose a direct reduction
method to such a pencil, and introduce the implicit rational QZ step. The link
with rational Krylov subspaces allows us to prove essential uniqueness
(implicit Q theorem) of the rational QZ iterates as well as convergence of the
proposed method. In the proofs, we operate directly on the pencil instead of
rephrasing it all in terms of a single matrix. Numerical experiments are
included to illustrate competitiveness in terms of speed and accuracy with the
classical approach. Two other types of experiments exemplify new possibilities.
First we illustrate that good pole selection can be used to deflate the
original problem during the reduction phase, and second we use the rational QZ
method to implicitly filter a rational Krylov subspace in an iterative method.

and nonstiff chemically reacting flows. In stiff cases, a well-known spurious
numerical phenomenon, i.e. the incorrect propagation speed of discontinuities,
may be produced by general fractional step methods due to the under-resolved
discretization in both space and time. The previous random projection method
has been successfully applied for stiff detonation capturing in under-resolved
conditions. Not to randomly project the intermediate state into two presumed
equilibrium states (completely burnt or unburnt) as in the random projection
method, the present study is to randomly choose the time-dependent advance or
stop of a reaction process. Each one-way reaction has been decoupled from the
multi-reaction kinetics using operator splitting and the local smeared
temperature due to numerical dissipation of shock-capturing schemes is compared
with a random one within two limited temperatures corresponding to the advance
and its inverse states, respectively, to control the random reaction. The
random activation or deactivation in the reaction step is thus promising to
correct the deterministic accumulative error of the propagation of
discontinuities. Extensive numerical experiments, including model problems and
realistic reacting flows in one and two dimensions, demonstrate this
expectation as well as the effectiveness and robustness of the method.
Meanwhile, for nonstiff problems when spatial and temporal resolutions are
fine, the proposed random method recovers the results as general fractional
step methods, owing to the increasing possibility of activation with
diminishing randomness by adding a shift term.

different obfuscation techniques and a semantics-based metric for measuring the

fall-off conditions for metric and $U(1)$ gauge field. We find asymptotic
combined symmetry generator, consists of diffeomorphism and $U(1)$ gauge
transformation, so that it preserves fall-off conditions. Consequently, we find
supertranslation, supperrotation and multiple-charge modes and then we show
that the entropy formula is held for the Kerr-Newman (A)dS black hole.
Supperrotation modes suffer from a problem. By introducing new combined

Theories which can be made finite to all orders in perturbation theory, based
on the principle of reduction of couplings. The latter consists in searching
for renormalization group invariant relations among parameters of a
renormalizable theory holding to all orders in perturbation theory. FUTs have
proven very successful so far. In particular, they predicted the top quark mass
one and half years before its experimental discovery, while around five years
before the Higgs boson discovery a particular FUT was predicting the light
Higgs boson in the mass range ~ 121 - 126 GeV, in striking agreement with the
discovery at LHC. Here we review the basic properties of the supersymmetric
theories and in particular finite theories resulting from the application of
the method of reduction of couplings in their dimensionless and dimensionful
sectors. Then we analyse the phenomenologically favoured FUT, based on SU(5).
This particular FUT leads to a finiteness constrained version of the MSSM,
which naturally predicts a relatively heavy spectrum with coloured
supersymmetric particles above 2.7 TeV, consistent with the non-observation of
those particles at the LHC. The electroweak supersymmetric spectrum starts
below 1 TeV and large parts of the allowed spectrum of the lighter might be
accessible at CLIC. The FCC-hh will be able to fully test the predicted
spectrum.

electronics for nearly 30 years. The effects of the various possible RPWM
strategies on the Power Spectral Density have been thoroughly studied. Despite
the effectiveness of RPWM in spreading harmonic content, an appeal is
consistently made to maintain the textbook Pulse Width Modulation scheme 'on
average'. Random Switching (RS) does away with this notion and
probabilistically operates the switch. In addition to fulfilling several
optimality conditions, including being the only viable switching strategy at
the theoretical limit of performance and having lower switching losses than any
other RPWM; RS allows for design of the DC behaviour separately from that of
the PSD. The pulse amplitude probability affects the DC and total PSD. The
first and second moment of the pulse length probability distribution affects
the shape of the envelope of the noise of the PSD. The minimum pulse length
acts like a selective harmonic filter. The PSD can therefore be shaped without
external filtering by changing these probabilities. Gaussian and Huffman pulse
length probabilities are shown to be good choices depending on whether
real-time PSD control or spectrum usage are the design goal. In addition, it is
shown that C\'uk's state space averaging model applies to RS, with $D \to p$,
hence no new tools are needed to understand the low frequency behavior or
control performance. A benefit of closed loop random switching is that no
filtering of the controlled variable is required. Randomly responding in a
biased manner dependent on the error is hence shown to be useful. There are
several good reasons to consider RS for high performance applications.

optimisation of a function $f$ which is only accessible via point evaluations.
It is typically used in settings where $f$ is expensive to evaluate. A common
use case for BO in machine learning is model selection, where it is not
possible to analytically model the generalisation performance of a statistical
model, and we resort to noisy and expensive training and validation procedures
to choose the best model. Conventional BO methods have focused on Euclidean and
categorical domains, which, in the context of model selection, only permits
tuning scalar hyper-parameters of machine learning algorithms. However, with
the surge of interest in deep learning, there is an increasing demand to tune
neural network \emph{architectures}. In this work, we develop NASBOT, a
Gaussian process based BO framework for neural architecture search. To
accomplish this, we develop a distance metric in the space of neural network
architectures which can be computed efficiently via an optimal transport
program. This distance might be of independent interest to the deep learning
community as it may find applications outside of BO. We demonstrate that NASBOT
outperforms other alternatives for architecture search in several cross

simple analytic model, that grasps the main effects dominating the physical
system. We find the physics governing the system to be dominated by a simple,
one-dimensional effect, based on the careful observation of the different
radiation temperatures that are involved in the problem. The model is completed
with the main two-dimensional effect which is caused by the loss of energy to
the gold walls. Second, we examine the validity of the discontinuous asymptotic

A simplified
common emitter circuit configuration was adopted and respective
time-independent and time-dependent voltage and current equations were
obtained. As phasor analysis cannot be used because of the non-linearity, the
voltage at the capacitor was represented in terms of the respective integral,
implying a numerical approach. The effect of purely resistive loads was
investigated first, and it was shown that the fanned structure of the
transistor isolines can severely distort the amplification, especially for
$V_a$ small and $s$ large. The total harmonic distortion was found not to
depend on $V_a$, being determined by $s$ and the load resistance $R$. An
expression was obtained for the current gain in terms of the base current and
it was shown that it decreases in an almost perfectly linearly fashion with
$I_B$. Remarkably, no gain variation, and hence perfectly linear amplification,
is obtained when $R=0$, provided maximum power dissipation limits are not
exceeded. Capacitive loads imply the detachment of the circuit trajectory from
a straight line to an ""ellipsoidal""-like loop. This implies a gain asymmetry
along upper or lower arcs of this loop. By using the time-dependent circuit
equations, it was possible to show numerically and by an analytical
approximation that, at least for the adopted circuit and parameter values, the
asymmetry induced by capacitive loads is not substantial. However, capacitive
loads will imply lag between the output voltage and current and, hence,
low-pass filtering. It was shown that smaller $V_a$ and larger $s$ can
substantially reduce the phase lag, but at the cost of severe distortion.

engineered group velocity dispersion (GVD) are important to nonlinear photonic
devices such as soliton microcombs. Yet, despite intensive research efforts,
nonlinear integrated photonic platforms still feature propagation losses orders
of magnitude higher than in standard optical fiber. The tight confinement and
high index contrast of integrated waveguides make them highly susceptible to
fabrication induced surface roughness. Therefore, microresonators with
ultra-high Q factors are, to date, only attainable in polished bulk
crystalline, or chemically etched silica based devices, that pose however
challenges for full photonic integration. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication
of silicon nitride ($\mathrm{Si_3N_4}$) waveguides with unprecedentedly smooth
sidewalls and tight confinement with record low propagation losses. This is
achieved by combining the photonic Damascene process with a novel reflow
process, which reduces etching roughness, while sufficiently preserving
dimensional accuracy. This leads to previously unattainable \emph{mean}
microresonator Q factors larger than $5\times10^6$ for tightly confining
waveguides with anomalous dispersion. Via systematic process step variation and
two independent characterization techniques we differentiate the scattering and
absorption loss contributions, and reveal metal impurity related absorption to
be an important loss origin. Although such impurities are known to limit
optical fibers, this is the first time they are identified, and play a tangible
role, in absorption of integrated microresonators. Taken together, our work
provides new insights in the origins of propagation losses in
$\mathrm{Si_3N_4}$ waveguides and provides the technological basis for
integrated nonlinear photonics in the ultra-high Q regime.
