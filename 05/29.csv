non-local correlations relative to an effective impurity model. Choosing the
impurity as that of a dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) solution at
self-consistency is popular, and the corrections from dual fermion theory are
physically meaningful. We investigate the effect of choosing the impurity
instead in a self-consistent manner and find for the two dimensional Hubbard
model an exponentially increase of the correlation length and susceptibility at
low temperatures. There are pronounced differences for the two self-consistency
schemes that are discussed in the literature; the self-consistent DF solution
can even be more metallic than the DMFT solution.

affects the derivation of synthetic observables across the electromagnetic
spectrum. We implement a formalism for treating wind clumping - in particular
the light-leakage effects associated with a medium that is porous in physical
and velocity space - into the global (photosphere+wind) NLTE model atmosphere
code FASTWIND. We assume a stochastic, two-component wind consisting of a
mixture of optically thick and thin clumps embedded in a rarefied inter-clump
medium. We account fully for the reductions in opacity associated with porosity
in physical and velocity-space, and for the well-known effect that opacities
depending on rho^2 are higher in clumpy winds than in smooth ones of equal
mass-loss rate. By formulating our method in terms of suitable mean and
effective opacities for the clumpy wind, we are able to compute models with the
same speed (~15 min. on a modern laptop) as in previous code-generations. Some
first, generic results of the new models include: i) Confirming earlier results
that velocity-space porosity is critical for analysis of UV wind lines in
O-stars; ii) for the optical Halpha line, optically thick clumping effects are
small for O-stars, but potentially very important for late B and A-supergiants;
iii) spatial porosity is a marginal effect for absorption of high-energy X-rays
in O-stars, as long as the mean-free path between clumps are kept at realistic
values; iv) porosity is negligible at typical O-star radio-photosphere radii;
v) regarding the wind ionization balance, a general trend is that increased
rates of recombination in simulations with optically thin clumps lead to
overall lower degrees of ionization than in corresponding smooth models, but
that this effect now is counteracted by the increased levels of light-leakage
associated with porosity in physical and velocity space.

from functional programming with infinite data structures to formulations of
step-indexing internal to type theory. Categorical models have revealed that

  Unfortunately, existing guarded type theories suffer from significant

the later modality is not expressive enough to capture precise input-output

well-known that its Minkowski function is plurisubharmonic. In this short note,
we prove that under the additional assumption of smoothness of the boundary,
the Minkowski function of a quasi-balanced domain is in fact smooth away from
the origin. This allows us to construct a smooth plurisubharmonic defining
function for such domains. Our result is new even in the case of balanced
domains.

  CrB Star)","To be submitted to JAAVSO",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We have used many decades of visual observations from the AAVSO International
Database, and the AAVSO time-series analysis package VSTAR, to study the
long-term changes in period, amplitude, and mean magnitude in about 30 normal
pulsating red giants (PRGs) i.e. those without large secular changes in period,
as well as a few of the rare PRGs which do have such secular period changes.
The periods of the typical PRGs ""wander"" on time scales of about 40 pulsation
periods -- significantly longer than the time scales of amplitude variation
which are 20-35 with a mean of 27 pulsation periods. We have also studied the
range and time scale of the long-term changes in pulsation amplitude and mean
magnitude, as well as period, and looked for correlations between these.
Changes in mean magnitude are larger in stars in stars with larger mean
amplitude, but correlate negatively with changes in amplitude. There is a weak
positive correlation between the long-term period changes and amplitude
changes. The causes of these three kinds of long-term changes are still not
clear. We note, from the presence of harmonics in the Fourier spectra, that the
longest-period PRGs have distinctly non-sinusoidal phase curves. For studying
PRGs, we demonstrate the advantage of studying stars with minimal seasonal gaps
in the observations, such as those near the celestial poles. We studied Z UMi,
misclassified as a possible Mira star, but actually an R CrB star. We
determined times of onset of 16 fadings. We were not able to determine a
coherent pulsation period for this star at maximum, with an amplitude greater
than 0.05. We did, however, find that the times of onset of fadings were
""locked"" to a 41.98-day period -- a typical pulsation period for an R CrB star.

autoencode any kind of data by choosing X to be itself a RKHS. A theoretical

We utilize the Simsilun simulation, which is based on the approximation of the
silent universe. In the limit of spatial homogeneity and isotropy the silent
universes reduce to the standard FLRW models. We show that within the
approximation of the silent universe the formation of the most massive
cosmological objects differs from the standard background-dependent approaches.
For objects with masses above $10^{15} M_\odot$ the effect of spatial curvature
(overdense regions are characterized by positive spatial curvature) leads to
measurable effects. The effect is analogous to the effect that the background
cosmological model has on the formation of these objects (i.e. the higher
matter density and spatial curvature the faster the growth of cosmic
structures). We measure this by the means of the mass function and show that
the mass function obtained from the Simsilun simulation has a higher amplitude
at the high-mass end compared to standard mass function such as the
Press-Schechter or the Tinker mass function. For comparison, we find that the
expected mass of most massive objects using the Tinker mass function is
$4.4^{+0.8}_{-0.6} \, \times 10^{15} M_\odot$, whereas for the Simsilun
simulation is $6.3^{+1.0}_{-0.8} \, \times 10^{15} M_\odot$. We conclude that
the nonlinear relativistic effects could affect the formation of the most
massive cosmological objects, leading to a relativistic environment-dependence
of the growth rate of the most massive clusters.

are expected to be key in the development of SR solutions for next-generation
WLANs, since many deployments are characterized by being uncoordinated by
nature. However, the potential of decentralized mechanisms is limited by the
significant lack of knowledge with respect to the overall wireless environment.
To shed some light on this subject, we show the main considerations and
possibilities of applying online learning to address the SR problem in
uncoordinated WLANs. In particular, we provide a solution based on Multi-Armed
Bandits (MABs) whereby independent WLANs dynamically adjust their frequency
channel, transmit power and sensitivity threshold. To that purpose, we provide
two different strategies, which refer to selfish and environment-aware
learning. While the former stands for pure individual behavior, the second one
considers the performance experienced by surrounding networks, thus taking into

our approach outperforms a variety of baselines at (i) estimating grasp

processes. Among the most promising agents of feedback are cosmic rays (CRs),
the relativistic ion population of interstellar and intergalactic plasmas. In
these environments, energetic CRs are virtually collisionless and interact via
collective phenomena mediated by kinetic-scale plasma waves and large-scale
magnetic fields. The enormous separation of kinetic and global astrophysical
scales requires a hydrodynamic description. Here, we develop a new macroscopic
theory for CR transport in the self-confinement picture, which includes CR
diffusion and streaming. The interaction between CRs and electromagnetic fields
of Alfv\'enic turbulence provides the main source of CR scattering, and causes
CRs to stream along the magnetic field with the Alfv\'en velocity if resonant
waves are sufficiently energetic. However, numerical simulations struggle to
capture this effect with current transport formalisms and adopt regularization
schemes to ensure numerical stability. We extent the theory by deriving an
equation for the CR momentum density along the mean magnetic field and include
a transport equation for the Alfv\'en-wave energy. We account for energy
exchange of CRs and Alfv\'en waves via the gyroresonant instability and include
other wave damping mechanisms. Using numerical simulations we demonstrate that
our new theory enables stable, self-regulated CR transport. The theory is
coupled to magneto-hydrodynamics, conserves the total energy and momentum, and
correctly recovers previous macroscopic CR transport formalisms in the
steady-state flux limit. Because it is free of tunable parameters, it holds the
promise to provide predictable simulations of CR feedback in galaxy formation.

desire to model the sub-mm line emission of galaxies within cosmological galaxy
formation models. This is typically done in post-processing by applying
sub-resolution recipes to describe the properties of the unresolved
interstellar medium. At the same time, while there is freedom in how one
implements these sorts of recipes, the impact of various choices has yet to be
systematically explored in simulations. In this paper, we do just that. We
combine a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation with chemical equilibrium
networks and numerical radiative transfer models and explore how different
choices for the sub-grid modeling affect the predicted CO, [CI], and [CII]
emission of galaxies. We find that a key component for a successful model
includes a molecular cloud mass-size relation and scaling for the ultraviolet
and cosmic ray radiation field that varies based on local ISM properties. Our
most successful model adopts a Plummer profile for the radial density
distribution of gas within molecular clouds. On the other hand, different
assumptions for the clumping of gas within molecular clouds and changes in the
slope of the molecular cloud mass distribution function hardly affect the CO,
[CI], and [CII] luminosities of galaxies. At fixed star-formation rate the
[CII]-SFR ratio of galaxies scales inversely with the pressure acting on
molecular clouds, increasing the molecular clouds density and hence decreasing
the importance of [CII] line cooling. Overall we find that it is essential that
a wide range of sub-mm emission lines arising in vastly different phases of the
ISM are used as model constraints in order to limit the freedom in sub-grid
choices and we present the details of the most successful model variant.

order in perturbation theory. However, previous work found that information can
be classically localized in a region in a way such that measurements, including
those of the gravitational field, outside the region are insensitive to that
information, and only measure total Poincare charges. This paper shows that,
working to leading order in the gravitational coupling, a similar quantum
result holds, leading to a definition of a ""gravitational splitting"" on the

a role for ""soft hair"" in resolving the information problem for black holes.

$\sigma_{\rm ECSN} = 0,7,15,26,265$ km s$^{-1}$. The total number of DNSs
scales inversely with $\sigma_{\rm ECSN}$ and the number of DNS mergers is

assume low efficiency of common-envelope ejection (described by the parameter
$\alpha=1$), while it is only mild for high efficiency of common-envelope
ejection ($\alpha{}=5$). In most simulations, more than 50 per cent of the
progenitors of merging DNSs undergo at least one ECSN and the ECSN is almost
always the first SN occurring in the binary system. Finally, we have considered
the extreme case in which all neutron stars receive a low natal kick

factor of ten and the percentage of merging DNSs which went through an ECSN is

along its orbit due to the strong disk-planet interaction and migrates with the
gap in the disk. It is expected that in the ideal case, a gap-opening planet
migrates at the viscous drift speed, which is referred to as type II migration.
However, recent hydrodynamic simulations have shown that in general, the
gap-opening planet is not locked to the viscous disk evolution. A new physical
model is required to explain the migration speed of such a planet. For this
reason, we re-examined the migration of a planet in the disk, by carrying out
the two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations in a wide parameter range. We have
found that the torque exerted on the gap-opening planet depends on the surface
density at the bottom of the gap. The planet migration slows down as the
surface density of the bottom of the gap decreases. Using the gap model
developed in our previous studies, we have constructed an empirical formula of
the migration speed of the gap-opening planets, which is consistent with the
results given by the hydrodynamic simulations performed by us and other
researchers. Our model easily explains why the migration speed of the
gap-opening planets can be faster than the viscous gas drift speed. It can also
predict the planet mass at which the type I migration is no longer adequate due
to the gap development in the disk, providing a gap formation criterion based
on planetary migration.

the model of Burkhart (2018), which employs a piecewise lognormal and powerlaw
density Probability Distribution Function (PDF). We show that the PDF
transition density from lognormal to powerlaw forms is a mathematically
motivated critical density for star formation and can be physically related to
the density where the Jeans length is comparable to the sonic length, i.e. the
post-shock critical density for collapse. When the PDF transition density is
taken as the critical density, the instantaneous star formation efficiency
($\epsilon_{\rm inst}$) and depletion time ($\tau_{\rm depl}$) can be
calculated from the dense self-gravitating gas fraction represented as the
fraction of gas in the PDF powerlaw tail. We minimize the number of free
parameters in the analytic expressions for $\epsilon_{\rm inst}$ and $\tau_{\rm
depl}$ by using the PDF transition density instead of a parameterized critical
density for collapse and thus provide a more direct pathway for comparison with
observations. We test the analytic predictions for the transition density and
self-gravitating gas fraction against AREPO moving mesh gravoturbulent
simulations and find good agreement. We predict that, when gravity dominates
the density distribution in the star-forming gas, the star formation efficiency
should be weakly anti-correlated with the sonic Mach number while the depletion
time should increase with increasing sonic Mach number. The star formation
efficiency and depletion time depend primarily on the dense self-gravitating
gas fraction, which in turn depends on the interplay of gravity, turbulence and
stellar feedback. Our model prediction is in agreement with recent

Using numerical simulations of magneto-gravo-turbulence, we describe the
structural properties of dense shocks, which are the seeds of gravitational
collapse, as a function of magnetic field strength. In the regime of a weak
magnetic field, the collapse is isotropic. Strong magnetic field strengths lead
to significant anisotropy in the shocked distribution and collapse occurs
preferentially parallel to the field lines. Our work provides insight into
analyzing the magnetic field topology and density structures of young
protostellar collapse, which the theory presented here predicts are associated
with large-scale strong shocks that persist for at least a free-fall time.

amplitudes factorize when the intermediate particle is on-shell, non-analytic

Based on this property, Polyakov, in his pioneering 1974 work, introduced a
basis for conformal correlators which manifestly satisfies the crossing
symmetry. He then initiated the bootstrap program by requiring its consistency
with the operator product expansion. This approach is complementary to the
ordinary bootstrap program, which is based on the conformal block and requires
the crossing symmetry as a consistency condition of the theory. Even though
Polyakov's original bootstrap approach has been revisited recently, the
crossing symmetric basis has not been constructed explicitly in momentum space.
In this paper we complete the construction of the crossing symmetric basis for
scalar four-point functions with an intermediate operator with a general spin,
by using new analytic expressions for three-point functions involving one
tensor. Our new basis manifests the analytic properties of conformal
correlators. Also the connected and disconnected correlators are manifestly
separated, so that it will be useful for the study of large $N$ CFTs in
particular.

we find a surface twist when the magnetization in the bulk is canted by an
in-plane external field. This twist at the surfaces caused by the
boundary-induced DMI differs from the common canting caused by internal DMI
observed at the edges of a chiral magnet. Further, we find that the surface
twist due to the boundary-induced DMI strongly affects the width of the domain
wall at the surfaces. We also find that the skyrmion radius increases in the

boundary-induced DMI. This increase suggests that the boundary-induced DMI

coupling to the standard model Higgs and dark matter coupling to its mother
particle occur at dimension six level involving the same flavon fields, thereby
generating the effective Yukawa coupling of same order of magnitudes. The
mother particle for dark matter, a complex scalar singlet, gets thermally
produced in the early Universe through Higgs portal couplings followed by its
thermal freeze-out and then decay into the dark matter candidates giving rise
to the freeze-in dark matter scenario. Some parts of the Higgs portal couplings
of the mother particle can also be excluded by collider constraints on
invisible decay rate of the standard model like Higgs boson. We show that the
correct neutrino oscillation data can be successfully produced in the model

intrinsically from a given geometry on $X$. An important point is that the

  A main new tool is the idea of local jet-equivalence, which gives rise to
local weak comparison, and then to comparison under a natural and necessary
global assumption.
  The main theorem applies to pairs $(F,f)$, which are locally jet-equivalent
to a given constant coefficient pair $({\bf F}, {\bf f})$. This covers a large

a riemannian manifold, G-invariant operators on manifolds with G-structure,
operators on almost complex manifolds, and operators, such as the Lagrangian
Monge-Amp\`ere operator, on symplectic manifolds. It also applies to all

  Complete existence and uniqueness results are established with existence

represents an algorithmic prior that improves learning performance in state

  (https://sites.google.com/view/deepvision2019)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we explore the problem of training one-look regression models
for counting objects in datasets comprising a small number of high-resolution,
variable-shaped images. We illustrate that conventional global average pooling
(GAP) based models are unreliable due to the patchwise cancellation of true
overestimates and underestimates for patchwise inference. To overcome this
limitation and reduce overfitting caused by the training on full-resolution
images, we propose to employ global sum pooling (GSP) instead of GAP or fully
connected (FC) layers at the backend of a convolutional network. Although
computationally equivalent to GAP, we show through comprehensive
experimentation that GSP allows convolutional networks to learn the counting
task as a simple linear mapping problem generalized over the input shape and
the number of objects present. This generalization capability allows GSP to
avoid both patchwise cancellation and overfitting by training on small patches
and inference on full-resolution images as a whole. We evaluate our approach on
four different aerial image datasets - two car counting datasets (CARPK and
COWC), one crowd counting dataset (ShanghaiTech; parts A and B) and one new
challenging dataset for wheat spike counting. Our GSP models improve upon the
state-of-the-art approaches on all four datasets with a simple architecture.
Also, GSP architectures trained with smaller-sized image patches exhibit better
localization property due to their focus on learning from smaller regions while
training.

gravity mediated decays of Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations of the Standard Model
(SM) particles offer interesting collider signals. Colored level-1 KK-particles
(quarks $q^1$ and/or gluons $g^{1}$) are pair-produced at the colliders due to
conserved KK-parity. These particles, then, cascade decay into lighter level-1
KK-particle in association with one or more SM particles until producing
lightest KK particle (LKP). The gravity mediation allows LKP to decay into
photon or $Z$-boson plus gravity excitation, hence resulting in
di-photon/$ZZ$/$Z\gamma$ plus missing transverse energy signatures at collider
experiments. Alternatively, pair-produced level-1 KK quarks/gluons may directly
decay into the corresponding SM quark/gluon and a gravity excitation resulting
in di-jet plus missing transverse energy signal. The ATLAS Collaboration has
recently communicated the results for di-photon and multi-jet plus missing
transverse energy searches with $36.1$ inverse-femtobarn of integrated
luminosity at $13$ TeV center-of-mass energy. No significant excess of events
above the SM expectation was observed in both searches. We constrain the
'fat-brane' UED model parameters, namely the fundamental Planck mass $M_{D}$
and the size of small extra dimensions $R$, in the light of above-mentioned
ATLAS searches.

estimations from magnetic resonance (MR) images. The estimated CT images can be
utilised for attenuation correction, patient positioning, and dose planning in
diagnostic and radiotherapy workflows. This study aims to introduce a novel
statistical learning approach for improving CT estimation from MR images and to
compare the performance of our method with the existing model based CT image
estimation methods.
  Methods: The statistical learning approach proposed here consists of two
stages. At the training stage, prior knowledges about tissue-types from CT
images were used together with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to explore CT
image estimations from MR images. Since the prior knowledges are not available
at the prediction stage, a classifier based on RUSBoost algorithm was trained
to estimate the tissue-types from MR images. For a new patient, the trained
classifier and GMMs were used to predict CT image from MR images. The
classifier and GMMs were validated by using voxel level 10-fold
cross-validation and patient-level leave-one-out cross-validation,
respectively.
  Results: The proposed approach has outperformance in CT estimation quality in
comparison with the existing model based methods, especially on bone tissues.
Our method improved CT image estimation by 5% and 23% on the whole brain and
bone tissues, respectively.
  Conclusions: Evaluation of our method shows that it is a promising method to
generate CT image substitutes for the implementation of fully MR-based
radiotherapy and PET/MRI applications.

since it is beneficial to decrease the failure rate of quantum computation. To
this purpose, scalable qubit plane architectures and efficient mapping passes
including placement and routing of qubits as well as scheduling of operations
are needed. This paper proposes a full mapping process to execute lattice
surgery-based quantum circuits on two surface code architectures, namely a
checkerboard and a tile-based one. We show that the checkerboard architecture

star is not well understood. The thousands of known sdAs have H-dominated
spectra, spectroscopic surface gravities intermediate to main sequence stars
and isolated white dwarfs, and effective temperatures below the lower limit for
He-burning subdwarfs. Most are likely products of binary stellar evolution,
whether extremely low-mass white dwarfs and their precursors, or blue
stragglers in the halo.
  Aims. Stellar eigenfrequencies revealed through time series photometry of
pulsating stars sensitively probe stellar structural properties. The properties
of pulsations exhibited by any sdA stars would contribute importantly to our
developing understanding of this class.
  Methods. We extend our photometric campaign to discover pulsating extremely
low-mass white dwarfs from McDonald Observatory to target sdA stars classified
from SDSS spectra. We also obtain follow-up time series spectroscopy to search
for binary signatures from four new pulsators.
  Results. Out of 23 sdA stars observed, we clearly detect stellar pulsations
in seven. Dominant pulsation periods range from 4.6 minutes to 12.3 hours, with
most on ~hour timescales. We argue specific classifications for some of the new
variables, identifying both compact and likely main sequence dwarf pulsators,
along with a candidate low-mass RR Lyrae star.
  Conclusions. With dominant pulsation periods spanning orders of magnitude,
the pulsational evidence supports the emerging narrative that the sdA class
consists of multiple stellar populations. Since multiple types of sdA exhibit
stellar pulsations, follow-up asteroseismic analysis can be used to probe the
precise evolutionary natures and stellar structures of these individual
subpopulations.

analyze the dependence of the Andreev conductance, Cooper pair splitting

affected by spin dependence of tunneling processes and quantum interference
between different local and nonlocal Andreev reflections. We also study the
effects of finite hopping between the side quantum dots on the Andreev current.
This allows for identifying the optimal conditions for enhancing the Cooper
pair splitting efficiency of the device. We find that the splitting efficiency
exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence on the degree of spin polarization of the
leads and the magnitude and type of hopping between the dots. An almost perfect
splitting efficiency is predicted in the nonlinear response regime when the
energies of the side quantum dots are tuned to the energies of the
corresponding Andreev bound states. In addition, we analyzed features of the
tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) for a wide range of the gate and bias voltages,
as well as for different model parameters, finding the corresponding sign
changes of the TMR in certain transport regimes. The mechanisms leading to
these effects are thoroughly discussed.

this pre-Conceptual Design Report (pCDR). nEXO is a tonne-scale neutrinoless
double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay search in $^{136}$Xe, based on the
ultra-low background liquid xenon technology validated by EXO-200. With
$\simeq$ 5000 kg of xenon enriched to 90% in the isotope 136, nEXO has a
projected half-life sensitivity of approximately $10^{28}$ years. This
represents an improvement in sensitivity of about two orders of magnitude with
respect to current results. Based on the experience gained from EXO-200 and the
effectiveness of xenon purification techniques, we expect the background to be
dominated by external sources of radiation. The sensitivity increase is,
therefore, entirely derived from the increase of active mass in a monolithic
and homogeneous detector, along with some technical advances perfected in the
course of a dedicated R&D program. Hence the risk which is inherent to the
construction of a large, ultra-low background detector is reduced, as the
intrinsic radioactive contamination requirements are generally not beyond those
demonstrated with the present generation $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay experiments.
Indeed, most of the required materials have been already assayed or reasonable
estimates of their properties are at hand. The details described herein
represent the base design of the detector configuration as of early 2018. Where
potential design improvements are possible, alternatives are discussed.
  This design for nEXO presents a compelling path towards a next generation
search for $0\nu\beta\beta$, with a substantial possibility to discover physics
beyond the Standard Model.

advances in deep learning. Most works focus on learning either a one-to-one
mapping in an unsupervised way or a many-to-many mapping in a supervised way.
However, a more practical setting is many-to-many mapping in an unsupervised
way, which is harder due to the lack of supervision and the complex inner- and
cross-domain variations. To alleviate these issues, we propose the Exemplar
Guided & Semantically Consistent Image-to-image Translation (EGSC-IT) network
which conditions the translation process on an exemplar image in the target
domain. We assume that an image comprises of a content component which is
shared across domains, and a style component specific to each domain. Under the
guidance of an exemplar from the target domain we apply Adaptive Instance
Normalization to the shared content component, which allows us to transfer the
style information of the target domain to the source domain. To avoid semantic
inconsistencies during translation that naturally appear due to the large
inner- and cross-domain variations, we introduce the concept of feature masks
that provide coarse semantic guidance without requiring the use of any semantic
labels. Experimental results on various datasets show that EGSC-IT does not
only translate the source image to diverse instances in the target domain, but
also preserves the semantic consistency during the process.

characterized by local statistics of deep visual features, is approximated by a

Finally, our approach allows us to manipulate the coefficients of the latent

from a Bose-Hubbard model with component-conserving, on-site interactions and

employed to provide an analytic expression for the drag density. In addition,
the Hamiltonian is diagonalized numerically to compute the drag within
mean-field theory at both zero and finite temperatures to all orders in
inter-component interactions. Moreover, path integral Monte Carlo simulations
have been performed to support the mean-field results. In the two-component
case the drag increases monotonically with the magnitude of the inter-component
interaction $\gamma_{AB}$ between the two components A and B. This no longer
holds when an additional third component C is included. Instead of increasing
monotonically, the drag can either be strengthened or weakened depending on the
details of the interaction strengths, for weak and moderately strong
interactions. The general picture is that the drag-coefficient between
component A and B is a non-monotonic function of the inter-component
interaction strength $\gamma_{AC}$ between A and a third component C. For weak
$\gamma_{AC}$ compared to the direct interaction $\gamma_{AB}$ between A and B,
the drag-coefficient between A and B can {\it decrease}, contrary to what one
naively would expect. When $\gamma_{AC}$ is strong compared to $\gamma_{AB}$,
the drag between A and B increases with increasing $\gamma_{AC}$, as one would
naively expect. We attribute the subtle reduction of $\rho_{d,AB}$ with
increasing $\gamma_{AC}$, which has no counterpart in the two-component case,
to a renormalization of the inter-component scattering vertex $\gamma_{AB}$ via
intermediate excited states of the third condensate $C$.

network latencies significantly compared to TCP (e.g., 10x), end-to-end
congestion control in the presence of incasts is a challenge. Targeting the
full generality of the congestion problem, previous schemes rely on slow,
iterative convergence to the appropriate sending rates (e.g., TIMELY takes 50
RTTs). Several papers have shown that even in oversubscribed datacenter
networks most congestion occurs at the receiver. Accordingly, we propose a
divide-and-specialize approach, called Dart, which isolates the common case of
receiver congestion and further subdivides the remaining in-network congestion
into the simpler spatially-localized and the harder spatially-dispersed cases.
For receiver congestion, we propose direct apportioning of sending rates (DASR)
in which a receiver for n senders directs each sender to cut its rate by a
factor of n, converging in only one RTT. For the spatially-localized case, Dart
provides fast (under one RTT) response by adding novel switch hardware for
in-order flow deflection (IOFD) because RDMA disallows packet reordering on
which previous load balancing schemes rely. For the uncommon
spatially-dispersed case, Dart falls back to DCQCN. Small-scale testbed
measurements and at-scale simulations, respectively, show that Dart achieves
60% (2.5x) and 79% (4.8x) lower 99th-percentile latency, and similar and 58%

are examined, interpreted and expanded to widen accessibility and understanding
of these works. The approach followed here is very much in the spirit adopted
by Peierls who eschewed a `rigorous axiomatic' and aimed at using `logic at the
level of the working physicist'. The fundamental tenet of his work is that the
wavefunction or density matrix represents the knowledge of an observer and that
two observers of the same system may well have different knowledge and will use
different density matrices to describe it. Essential to the understanding of
Peierls's approach is the demonstration given here that the density matrix
generally can be expressed entirely in terms of probabilities of observable
outcomes and that such probabilities are subjective in the first instance.The
process by which the knowledge of two observers may be combined is discussed in
detail for some simple cases and, by using Bayes's theorem, the progress to a
common understanding of the correct density matrix for a given situation
demonstrated. Peierls gave a criterion to ensure that the amalgamation of data
from two observers can never lead to violation of the uncertainty principle :
that the density matrices of two observers must commute. It is pointed out that
it is essential that the density matrices of two observers commute under all
circumstances no matter how inaccurate or even fanciful the data or beliefs
used to construct them. Once this is appreciated it can be shown that Peierls's
density matrix commutation criterion is fully equivalent to the standard result
in quantum mechanics that two observables must commute if they are to be known
precisely and simultaneously,but now extended to imperfectly known mixed states
rather than a single eigenstate.

of modalities (e.g., text, images and audio), representing valuable information
to be exploited for extracting valuable insights from users. Nevertheless, most
of the current work in AP using social media data has been devoted to analyze
textual information only, and there are very few works that have started
exploring the gender identification using visual information. Contrastingly,
this paper focuses in exploiting the visual modality to perform both age and

middle-aged composite supernova remnant (SNR) consisting of an SNR shell and a
pulsar wind nebula (PWN), which has been crushed by the SNR's reverse shock.
Previous $\gamma$-ray studies of SNR G326.3$-$1.8 revealed bright and extended
emission with uncertain origin. Understanding the nature of the $\gamma$-ray
emission allows probing the population of high-energy particles (leptons or
hadrons) but can be challenging for sources of small angular extent. With the
recent $\textit{Fermi}$ Large Area Telescope data release Pass 8, we
investigate the morphology of this SNR to disentangle the PWN from the SNR
contribution. We perform a morphological and spectral analysis from 300 MeV to
300 GeV. We use the reconstructed events with the best angular resolution to
separately investigate the PWN and the SNR emissions, which is crucial to
accurately determine the spectral properties of G326.3$-$1.8 and understand its
nature. The centroid of the $\gamma$-ray emission evolves with energy and is
spatially coincident with the radio PWN at high energies (E $>$ 3 GeV). The
morphological analysis reveals that a model considering two contributions from
the SNR and the PWN reproduces the $\gamma$-ray data better than a
single-component model. The associated spectral analysis using power laws shows
two distinct spectral features, a softer spectrum for the remnant ($\Gamma$ =
2.17 $\pm$ 0.06) and a harder spectrum for the PWN ($\Gamma$ = 1.79 $\pm$
0.12), consistent with hadronic and leptonic origin for the SNR and the PWN
respectively. Focusing on the SNR spectrum, we use one-zone models to derive
some physical properties and, in particular, we find that the emission is best
explained with a hadronic scenario in which the large target density is
provided by radiative shocks in HI clouds struck by the SNR.

maximum penalty of an individual segment. By using this solution to initialize
the estimation scheme, we are able to obtain a strongly polynomial algorithm.
In addition, we consider a cumulative version of Seg, where we are asked to
discover the optimal segmentation for each prefix of the input sequence. We

The approach combines a movement model (Ornstein- Uhlenbeck random process in

vertical direction) to ensure biologically-consistent trajectories in
three-dimensions, and an observation model to account for the effect of range,
altitude and bearing angle on the received signal strength. The observation
model of received signals accounts for low-end saturation from receiver noise,
high-end saturation from receiver non-linearities as well as a wireless
multipath phenomena, which modulates the received signal according to range,
the altitude and radiation characteristics of the Yagi array. A pattern
function for the Yagi array is synthesized that facilitates linearization of
the received signals and subsequent application of Kalman filtering.
  We first validate the model using a simulated trajectory and then estimate
the space-time trajectory of a migrating VHF-tagged shorebird, which was
tracked with a regional automated radio telemetry network. The algorithm
accurately predicted the average movement trajectory given the system
parameters and the initial conditions (average error $<$ 1 km). The modeled
shorebird track represents a first estimate in three-dimensional (3D) of a
radio tagged bird using a fixed telemetry array, and was qualitatively
reasonable, but exhibited some sensitivity in the vertical plane and to initial

and lack of a dynamic- disorder-induced central peak in the spectra at room
temperature indicate that the coupling of Cs anharmonic motion to Br atoms,
known to cause the dynamic disorder in CsPbBr3, is absent in CsPb2Br5.

coronal holes (CHs). They extend high into the solar corona and last from hours
to days. The heating processes of plumes involve dynamics of the magnetic field
at their base, but the processes themselves remain mysterious. Recent
observations suggest that plume heating is a consequence of magnetic flux
cancellation and/or convergence at the plume base. These studies suggest that
the base flux in plumes is of mixed polarity, either obvious or hidden in SDO
HMI data, but do not quantify it. To investigate the magnetic origins of plume
heating, we select ten unipolar network flux concentrations, four in CHs, four
in QRs, and two that do not form a plume, and track plume luminosity in SDO AIA
171 A images along with the base flux in SDO HMI magnetograms, over each flux
concentrations lifetime. We find that plume heating is triggered when
convergence of the base flux surpasses a field strength of 200 to 600 G. The
luminosity of both QR and CH plumes respond similarly to the field in the plume
base, suggesting that the two have a common formation mechanism. Our examples
of non-plume-forming flux concentrations, reaching field strengths of 200 G for
a similar number of pixels as for a couple of our plumes, suggest that a
critical field might be necessary to form a plume but is not sufficient for it,
thus, advocating for other mechanisms, e.g. flux cancellation due to hidden
opposite-polarity field, at play.

Training data subset selection and active learning techniques have been
proposed as possible solutions to these challenges respectively. A special
class of subset selection functions naturally model notions of diversity,
coverage and representation and they can be used to eliminate redundancy and
thus lend themselves well for training data subset selection. They can also
help improve the efficiency of active learning in further reducing human
labeling efforts by selecting a subset of the examples obtained using the
conventional uncertainty sampling based techniques. In this work we empirically
demonstrate the effectiveness of two diversity models, namely the
Facility-Location and Disparity-Min models for training-data subset selection
and reducing labeling effort. We do this for a variety of computer vision tasks
including Gender Recognition, Scene Recognition and Object Recognition. Our
results show that subset selection done in the right way can add 2-3% in
accuracy on existing baselines, particularly in the case of less training data.
This allows the training of complex machine learning models (like Convolutional
Neural Networks) with much less training data while incurring minimal
performance loss.

paper on a special class of ensembles systems, namely ensembles of multi-agent
formation systems. Specifically, we consider an ensemble of formation systems
indexed by a parameter in a compact, real analytic manifold. Every individual
formation system in the ensemble is composed of $N$ agents. These agents evolve
in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and can access relative positions of their neighbors. The
information flow topology within every individual formation system is, by
convention, described by a directed graph where the vertices correspond to the
$N$ agents and the directed edges indicate the information flow. For
simplicity, we assume in the paper that all the individual formation systems
share the same information flow topology described by a common digraph $G$.
Amongst other things, we establish a sufficient condition for approximate
path-controllability of the continuum ensemble of formation systems. We show
that if the digraph $G$ is strongly connected and the number $N$ of agents in

Holstein polaron is a small composite particle of an electron carrying a cloud
of self-induced lattice deformation (or phonons), which has been proposed to
play a key role in high-temperature superconductivity and carrier mobility in
devices. Here, we report the discovery of Holstein polarons in a surface-doped
layered semiconductor, MoS2, where a puzzling 2D superconducting dome with the
critical temperature of 12 K was found recently. Using a high-resolution band
mapping of charge carriers, we found strong band renormalizations collectively
identified as a hitherto unobserved spectral function of Holstein polarons. The
unexpected short-range nature of electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling in MoS2 can be
explained by its valley degeneracy that enables strong intervalley coupling
mediated by acoustic phonons. The coupling strength is found to gradually
increase along the superconducting dome up to the intermediate regime,
suggesting bipolaronic pairing in 2D superconductivity.

free-viewpoint viewing experiences. However, the most popular LF
representations are images from multiple views. Multi-view image-based
representations generally need to restrict the range or degrees of freedom of
the viewing experience to what can be interpolated in the image domain,
essentially because they lack explicit geometry information. We present a new
surface light field (SLF) representation based on explicit geometry, and a
method for SLF compression. First, we map the multi-view images of a scene onto
a 3D geometric point cloud. The color of each point in the point cloud is a
function of viewing direction known as a view map. We represent each view map
efficiently in a B-Spline wavelet basis. This representation is capable of
modeling diverse surface materials and complex lighting conditions in a highly
scalable and adaptive manner. The coefficients of the B-Spline wavelet
representation are then compressed spatially. To increase the spatial
correlation and thus improve compression efficiency, we introduce a smoothing
term to make the coefficients more similar across the 3D space. We compress the
coefficients spatially using existing point cloud compression (PCC) methods. On
the decoder side, the scene is rendered efficiently from any viewing direction
by reconstructing the view map at each point. In contrast to multi-view
image-based LF approaches, our method supports photo-realistic rendering of
real-world scenes from arbitrary viewpoints, i.e., with an unlimited six
degrees of freedom (6DOF). In terms of rate and distortion, experimental
results show that our method achieves superior performance with lighter decoder
complexity compared with a reference image-plus-geometry compression (IGC)
scheme, indicating its potential in practical virtual and augmented reality
applications.

to accurately estimate a user equipment (UE) location as well as the locations

that the external magnetic field overcomes the renormalized band gap, allowed
by doped magnetic impurities even without ferromagnetic ordering. In other
words, the Weyl metal physics can be controlled by doping magnetic impurities
into spin-orbit coupled semiconductors, even if the external magnetic field
alone cannot realize the Weyl metal phase due to relatively large band gaps of
semiconductors. Furthermore, we emphasize that quasiparticles do not exist in

never been discussed. This paper therefore proposes a way to automatically

Experimental results show that the multi-exposure images adjusted by the

expected, the statistical error that arises in the piecewise polytropic

theory to numerically-exact electromagnetic calculations of simulated BC

EMACBC evolve with increasing internal mixing ratios in simple power-law
exponents of 1/3. Remarkably, MACBC remains inversely proportional to
wavelength at any mixing ratio. When mixing states are represented using
mass-equivalent core-shell spheres, as is done in current climate models, it

least one Gaussian component of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), while anomalies
either do not belong to any Gaussian component. The method is based on Gaussian
Mixture Variational Autoencoder, which can learn feature representations of the
normal samples as a Gaussian Mixture Model trained using deep learning. A Fully
Convolutional Network (FCN) that does not contain a fully-connected layer is
employed for the encoder-decoder structure to preserve relative spatial
coordinates between the input image and the output feature map. Based on the
joint probabilities of each of the Gaussian mixture components, we introduce a
sample energy based method to score the anomaly of image test patches. A
two-stream network framework is employed to combine the appearance and motion
anomalies, using RGB frames for the former and dynamic flow images, for the
latter. We test our approach on two popular benchmarks (UCSD Dataset and Avenue
Dataset). The experimental results verify the superiority of our method
compared to the state of the arts.

Quantization is known to be an effective model compression method and

quantization, presenting high compression ratio without any modifications to

followed by retraining the model with full precision weights. We show that
iterative retraining generates new sets of weights which can be quantized with

uniformly and fully sampled. We find that the morphology revealed by the map of
velocity-integrated intensity of the NH3 (1, 1) line is closely associated with
the dust ridge. We identify 6 ""clumps"" related to the well known OMC-1 to 5 and
11 ""sub-clumps"" within the map and they are separated not randomly but in
roughly equal intervals along the ISF. The average spacing of clumps is
11.30'$\pm$1.31' (1.36$\pm$0.16 pc ) and the average spacing of sub-clumps is
7.18'$\pm$1.19' (0.86$\pm$0.14 pc). These spacings agree well with the
predicted values of the thermal (0.86 pc) and turbulent sausage instability
(1.43 pc) by adopting a cylindric geometry of the ISF with an inclination of
$60^{\circ}$ with respect to the line of sight. We also find a velocity
gradient of about 0.6 km s-1 pc-1 that runs along the ISF which likely arises
from an overall rotation of the Orion A molecular cloud. The inferred ratio
between rotational and gravitational energy is well below unity. Furthermore,
fluctuations are seen in the centroid velocity diagram along the ISF. The OMC-1

where each $A_i$ is an $n \times n$ polynomial matrix over $\mathbb{K}[t]$ and
$x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_m$ are pairwise ""non-commutative"" variables. This quantity is
regarded as a weighted generalization of the non-commutative rank (nc-rank) of
a linear symbolic matrix, and its computation is shown to be a generalization
of several basic combinatorial optimization problems, such as weighted
bipartite matching and weighted linear matroid intersection problems. Based on
the work on nc-rank by Fortin and Rautenauer (2004), and Ivanyos, Qiao, and
Subrahmanyam (2018), we develop a framework to compute the degree of the
Dieudonn\'e determinant of a linear symbolic matrix. We show that the deg-det
computation reduces to a discrete convex optimization problem on the Euclidean
building for ${\rm SL}(\mathbb{K}(t)^n)$. To deal with this optimization
problem, we introduce a class of discrete convex functions on the building.
This class is a natural generalization of L-convex functions in discrete convex
analysis (DCA). We develop a DCA-oriented algorithm (steepest descent
algorithm) to compute the degree of determinants. Our algorithm works with
matrix computation on $\mathbb{K}$, and uses a subroutine to compute a
certificate vector subspace for the nc-rank, where the number of calls of the
subroutine is sharply estimated. Our algorithm enhances some classical
combinatorial optimization algorithms with new insights, and is also understood
as a variant of the combinatorial relaxation algorithm, which was developed
earlier by Murota for computing the degree of the (ordinary) determinant.

both encompass height and slopes and other statistical moment of the field,
tacking into account the scale invariance. Contrary to the widely used fractal

We then show that weakly modular maximization is {\it fixed-parameter

In both cases, the van der Waals dispersion force out-competes traditional

giving a specific value of fit error to given data which is assumed to be
generated from a linear process using the design matrix. This yields the
typical achievable limit of the fit error when solving a representative
$\ell_0$ problem and includes the presence of unfavourable phase transitions
preventing local search algorithms from reaching the minimum-error
configuration. The associated phase diagrams are presented. A noteworthy
outcome of the phase diagrams is that there exists a wide parameter region
where any phase transition is absent from the high temperature to the lowest
temperature at which the minimum-error configuration or the ground state is
reached. This implies that certain local search algorithms can find the ground
state with moderate computational costs in that region. Another noteworthy
result is the presence of the random first-order transition in the strong noise
case. The theoretical evaluation of the entropy is confirmed by extensive
numerical methods using the exchange Monte Carlo and the multi-histogram
methods. Another numerical test based on a metaheuristic optimisation algorithm

for learning, and are easy to obtain in large quantities. Compared to unimodal
data, synchronization of concepts between modalities in such data provides
supervision for disentangling the underlying explanatory factors of each
modality. Previous work leveraging multimodal data has mainly focused on
retaining only the modality-invariant factors while discarding the rest. In
this paper, we present a partitioned variational autoencoder (PVAE) and several
training objectives to learn disentangled representations, which encode not
only the shared factors, but also modality-dependent ones, into separate latent
variables. Specifically, PVAE integrates a variational inference framework and
a multimodal generative model that partitions the explanatory factors and
conditions only on the relevant subset of them for generation. We evaluate our
model on two parallel speech/image datasets, and demonstrate its ability to
learn disentangled representations by qualitatively exploring within-modality
and cross-modality conditional generation with semantics and styles specified
by examples. For quantitative analysis, we evaluate the classification accuracy
of automatically discovered semantic units. Our PVAE can achieve over 99%
accuracy on both modalities.

has been shown to be extremely challenging, with few models able to aggregate
more than two facts before being overwhelmed by ""semantic drift"", or the

barrier to current inference models, as even elementary science questions
require an average of 4 to 6 facts to answer and explain. In this work we
empirically characterize the difficulty of building or traversing a graph of
sentences connected by lexical overlap, by evaluating chance sentence
aggregation quality through 9,784 manually-annotated judgments across knowledge
graphs built from three free-text corpora (including study guides and Simple

quality low, at between 0.04% and 3%, and highlight scenarios that maximize the

evidence for a lack of stars spinning at frequencies larger than $f\approx 700$
Hz, well below the predictions of theoretical equations of state. This has
generally been taken as evidence of an additional spin-down torque operating in
these systems and it has been suggested that gravitational wave torques may be
operating and be linked to a potentially observable signal. In this paper we
aim to determine whether additional spin-down torques are necessary, or whether
the observed limit of $f\approx 700$ Hz could correspond to the mass-shedding
frequency for the observed systems and is simply a consequence of the,
currently unknown, state of matter at high densities. Given our ignorance with
regard to the true equation of state of matter above nuclear saturation
densities, we make minimal physical assumption and only demand causality in the
core. We then connect our causally-limited equation of state to a realistic
microphysical crustal equation of state for densities below nuclear saturation
density. This produces a limiting model that will give the lowest possible
maximum frequency, which we compare to observational constraints on neutron
star masses and frequencies. We also compare our findings with the constraints
on the tidal deformability obtained in the observations of the GW170817 event.
We find that the lack of pulsars spinning faster than $f\approx 700$ Hz is not
compatible with our causal limited `minimal' equation of state, for which the
breakup frequency cannot be lower than $f_{\rm max}\approx 1200$ Hz. A low
frequency cutoff, around $f\approx 800$ Hz could only be possible if we assume
that these systems do not contain neutron stars with masses above $M\approx 2
M_\odot$. This would have to be due either to selection effects, or possibly to
a phase transition in the interior of the neutron star.

system comprising a cloud of two-level atoms and a movable mirror mediated by a
single-mode cavity field. When the system is at high temperatures with
quadrature fluctuations of light much above the standard quantum limit (SQL),
excitation counting on the collective atomic state can effectively reduce the
light noise close to the SQL. When the system is at low temperatures,
considerable squeezing of light below the SQL is found at steady state. The
squeezing is enhanced by simply increasing the atom-light coupling strength
with the laser power optimized close to the unstable regime, and further noise
reduction is achieved by decreasing various losses in the system. The presence
of atoms and excitation counting on the atoms lessen the limitation of thermal
noise, and the squeezing can be achieved at environment temperature of the
order K. The nonclassicality of the light, embodied by the negative
distributions of the Wigner function, is also studied by making non-Gaussian
measurements on the atoms. It is shown that with feasible parameters excitation
counting on the atoms is effective in inducing strongly optical
nonclassicality.

on photon-photon interaction, but interference between two-photon probability
amplitudes. Therefore, it might be possible to implement BSM without
interfering photons at a BS. Here, we investigate a linear optical BSM scheme

The symmetrically dividable property suggests informationally symmetrical BSM
between remote parties without a third party. We also present that our BSM

charge conjugate and parity symmetry, and the edge modes are shown to satisfy
parafermionic statistics, in which braiding of the two edge modes yields a
${2\pi \over 3}$ phase. This model also supports rich phases, including
topological ferromagnetic parafermion (FP) phase, trivial paramagnetic
parafermion phase, classical dimer phase and gapless phase. The boundaries of
the FP phase are shown to be gapless and critical with central charge $c =
4/5$. Even in the topological FP phase, it is also characterized by the
long-range string order, thus we observe a drop of string order across the

decrease fluctuations of the output power, in comparison with purely stochastic

efficiency, power and constancy, which applies to classical Markovian
steady-state heat engines. The concept is demonstrated using a model system
consisting of two tunnel-coupled orbitals (i.e., electronic levels), each
attached to a separate electronic reservoir; such a setup can be realized, for
example, using quantum dots. Electronic transport is studied by means of the
exact Levitov-Lesovik formula in the case without the Coulomb interaction
between electrons, as well as applying a quantum master equation in the
interacting case. Constancy of the analyzed thermoelectric generator is
increased due to the fact that tunneling between the orbitals is associated
with a unitary evolution of the electron state instead of a stochastic Poisson
transition. This reduces stochasticity of the system, thus suppressing the
current and power fluctuations. Moreover, noise can be further reduced by the
Coulomb interaction between electrons which prevents the double occupancy of

multifragmentation model (SMM). The sensitivities of these measures are
studied. All these measures predict a critical signature at or near to the
critical point both for the primary and secondary fragments. Among these
measures, the total multiplicity derivative and the NVZ provide accurate
measures for the critical point from the final cold fragments as well as the
primary fragments. The present study will provide a guide for future
experiments and analyses in the study of nuclear liquid-gas phase transition.

neighboring regions, using numerical simulations. The numerics is governed by
the equations of general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics (GRMHD). In
particular, such disks and outflows can be found at the base of very energetic
ultra-relativistic jets produced by cosmic explosions, so called gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs). Another, more persistent type of the jet phenomena, are blazars,
emitted from the centers of galaxies. Long-lasting, detailed computations are
essential to properly determine the physics of these explosions, and confront
the theoretical models with any potential observables. From the point of view
of numerical methods and computational techniques, three ingredients need to be
considered. First, the numerical scheme must work in a conservative manner,
which is achieved by solving a set of non-linear equations at each time-step,
to advance the conserved quantities from one time step to the next. Second, the
efficiency of computations intrinsically depends on the code parallelization
methods, which may use various techniques. Third, the analysis of results is
possible via the post-processing of the computed time-dependent physical
quantities, and visualization of the flow properties. This is done via
implementing various packages and libraries that are standardized in the field
of computational astrophysics and supported by community developers. In the
present paper, we discuss the physical picture of the cosmic sources which are
modeled using numerical framework. We also describe several technical issues,
in the particular context of our own experience with the performance of the
GRMHD code which we develop. We also present a suite of performance tests, done
on the High-Performance Computer cluster (HPC) in the Center for Mathematical
Modeling of the Warsaw University.

and event detector for weakly interacting particles such as neutrinos and Dark
Matter. For such rare processes, background radiation must be carefully
minimized. Radon provides one of the most significant contaminants since it is
an inevitable product of trace amounts of natural uranium. To design a
purification system for reducing such contamination, the adsorption
characteristics of radon in nitrogen, argon, and xenon carrier gases on various
types of charcoals with different adsorbing properties and intrinsic
radioactive purities have been studied in the temperature range of 190-295 K at
flow rates of 0.5 and 2 standard liters per minute. Essential performance
parameters for the various charcoals include the average breakthrough times
($\tau$), dynamic adsorption coefficients (k$_a$) and the number of theoretical
stages (n). It is shown that the k$_a$-values for radon in nitrogen, argon, and
xenon increase as the temperature of the charcoal traps decreases, and that
they are significantly larger in nitrogen and argon than in xenon gas due to
adsorption saturation effects. It is found that, unlike in xenon, the dynamic
adsorption coefficients for radon in nitrogen and argon strictly obey the
Arrhenius law. The experimental results strongly indicate that nitric acid
etched Saratech is the best candidate among all used charcoal brands. It allows
reducing total radon concentration in the LZ liquid Xe detector to meet the
ultimate goal in the search for Dark Matter.

lower cutoff energies than Broad Line Seyfert 1 galaxies reported in the
literature. We also perform spectral fittings with a model in which the cutoff
power law is replaced with the thermal Comptonization model in order to
directly obtain the electron temperature of the corona (kTe). The fits give kTe

fits in the three periods hint that kTe is the lower in the higher flux period.
The results of the four sources suggest a possible anti-correlation between kTe

Eddington luminosity. The anti-correlation can be explained by a simple model
in which electrons in the corona are cooled and heated through inverse Compton

Uncertainty in neural networks has thus been largely ignored in practice,
despite the fact that it may provide important information about the
reliability of predictions and the inner workings of the network. In this
paper, we introduce two lightweight approaches to making supervised learning
with probabilistic deep networks practical: First, we suggest probabilistic
output layers for classification and regression that require only minimal
changes to existing networks. Second, we employ assumed density filtering and
show that activation uncertainties can be propagated in a practical fashion
through the entire network, again with minor changes. Both probabilistic
networks retain the predictive power of the deterministic counterpart, but
yield uncertainties that correlate well with the empirical error induced by
their predictions. Moreover, the robustness to adversarial examples is
significantly increased.

perform inference and learning in latent variable models as they allow us to
leverage the rich representational power of neural networks to obtain flexible
approximations of the posterior of latent variables as well as tight evidence
lower bounds (ELBOs). Combined with stochastic variational inference, this
provides a methodology scaling to large datasets. However, for this methodology
to be practically efficient, it is necessary to obtain low-variance unbiased
estimators of the ELBO and its gradients with respect to the parameters of
interest. While the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques such as
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) has been previously suggested to achieve this
[23, 26], the proposed methods require specifying reverse kernels which have a
large impact on performance. Additionally, the resulting unbiased estimator of
the ELBO for most MCMC kernels is typically not amenable to the
reparameterization trick. We show here how to optimally select reverse kernels
in this setting and, by building upon Hamiltonian Importance Sampling (HIS)
[17], we obtain a scheme that provides low-variance unbiased estimators of the
ELBO and its gradients using the reparameterization trick. This allows us to
develop a Hamiltonian Variational Auto-Encoder (HVAE). This method can be
reinterpreted as a target-informed normalizing flow [20] which, within our
context, only requires a few evaluations of the gradient of the sampled
likelihood and trivial Jacobian calculations at each iteration.

precision of this sample make it possible to unveil, for the first time,
signatures of different surface inhomogeneity regimes in the amplitude-period

bimodality, with an evident gap at periods $P \le 2$ d. The low amplitude
branch, in turn, shows a period bimodality with a main clustering at periods $P

the period-absolute magnitude (or period-color) diagram, with the low- and

that such a multimodality represents a further evidence of the existence of
different regimes of surface inhomogeneities in young and middle-age low-mass
stars and we lay out possible scenarios for their evolution, which manifestly
include rapid transitions from one regime to another. In particular, the data
indicate that stars spinning up close to break-up velocity undergo a very rapid

of age $\sim$ 100 -- 600 Myr belonging to the slow-rotator low-amplitude

on bounding box annotations provided for each frame of each training video. As
annotating boxes in video is expensive, cumbersome and error-prone, we propose
to bypass box-supervision. Instead, we introduce action localization based on
point-supervision. We start from unsupervised spatio-temporal proposals, which
provide a set of candidate regions in videos. While normally used exclusively
for inference, we show spatio-temporal proposals can also be leveraged during
training when guided by a sparse set of point annotations. We introduce an
overlap measure between points and spatio-temporal proposals and incorporate
them all into a new objective of a Multiple Instance Learning optimization.
During inference, we introduce pseudo-points, visual cues from videos, that
automatically guide the selection of spatio-temporal proposals. We outline five
spatial and one temporal pseudo-point, as well as a measure to best leverage
pseudo-points at test time. Experimental evaluation on three action
localization datasets shows our pointly-supervised approach (i) is as effective
as traditional box-supervision at a fraction of the annotation cost, (ii) is
robust to sparse and noisy point annotations, (iii) benefits from pseudo-points
during inference, and (iv) outperforms recent weakly-supervised alternatives.
This leads us to conclude that points provide a viable alternative to boxes for
action localization.

Recently it was revealed, that they also have unconventional electronic

transport in these compounds, we take into account electron scattering beyond
commonly used constant relaxation time approximation. Using first principle
calculations, we investigate the scattering of charge carriers by phonons and
point defects. The dependence of the scattering rate on the energy correlates
with that for the total density of states. This implies that in this material
not only the intraband, but also the interband scattering is important,
especially for bands with low density of states. The Seebeck coefficient and
the electrical resistivity of CoSi and of dilute solid solutions
Co$_{1-x}$M$_x$Si (M=Fe or Ni, $x<0.1$) are calculated as a function of
temperature and the alloy composition. We show that the account of strong

change of its temperature dependence with the substitution of cobalt for iron,
as well as for the description of the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient, its

latency of 1.1us and better power efficiency than existing hardware based

input image within its layers. More specifically, the network learns a
continuous function that approximates the discrete RGB values sampled over the
discrete 2D pixel locations. At test time, given a 2D pixel coordinate, the
neural network will output the approximate RGB values of the corresponding
pixel. By considering every 2D pixel location, the network can actually
reconstruct the entire learned image. It is important to note that we have to
train an individual neural network for each input image, i.e. one network
encodes a single image only. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to
propose a neural approach for encoding images individually, by learning a
mapping from the 2D pixel coordinate space to the RGB color space. Our neural
image encoding approach has various low-level image processing applications

resampling and image completion. We conduct experiments that include both

cylindrical microchannels. We investigate how the mass transfer is affected by
the channel and bubble sizes, distance between bubbles, diffusivity,
superficial velocity, deformation of the bubble, the presence of surfactants in
the limit of rigid interface and off-centred positions of the bubbles. We
analyse the influence of the dimensionless numbers and especially the distance
between bubbles and the P\'eclet number, Pe, which we vary among eight decades
and identify five different dissolution regimes. We show different
concentration patterns and the dependence of the Sherwood numbers, Sh. These
regimes can be classified by either the importance of the streamline diffusion
or by the interaction between bubbles. For small Pe the streamline diffusion is
not negligible as compared to convection whereas for large Pe, convection
dominates in the streamline direction and, thus, crosswind diffusion becomes
crucial in governing the dissolution through boundary layers or of the
remaining wake behind the bubbles. Bubbles interaction takes place for very
small Pe for which the dissolution is purely diffusive or for very large Pe
numbers in which case long wakes eventually reach the following bubble. We also
observe that the bubble deformability mainly affects the Sh in the regime for
very large Pe in which bubbles interaction matters, and also that the rigid
interface effect affects the boundary layer and the remaining wake. The effect
of off-centred position of the bubble, determined by the transverse force
balance, is also limited to large Pe. The boundary layers in rigid bubble
surfaces are thicker as compared to those on stress-free bubble surface and,
thus, the dissolution is smaller. For centred bubbles, the influence of inertia
on the dissolution is negligible. Finally, we discuss underlying hypothesis of
the model.

calibration is essential to enhance the social integration of the robot into
the group. When calibrated, the behavioural model of fish behaviour is
implemented to drive a robot with closed-loop control of social interactions
into a group of zebrafish. This approach can be useful to form mixed-groups,
and study animal individual and collective behaviour by using biomimetic
autonomous robots capable of responding to the animals in long-standing
experiments. Here, we show a methodology for continuous real-time calibration
and refinement of multi-level behavioural model. The real-time calibration, by
an evolutionary algorithm, is based on simulation of the model to correspond to
the observed fish behaviour in real-time. The calibrated model is updated on
the robot and tested during the experiments. This method allows to cope with
changes of dynamics in fish behaviour. Moreover, each fish presents individual
behavioural differences. Thus, each trial is done with naive fish groups that
display behavioural variability. This real-time calibration methodology can
optimise the robot behaviours during the experiments. Our implementation of
this methodology runs on three different computers that perform individual
tracking, data-analysis, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, simulation of

times. This led to an abundance of data related to video games being shared
online. However, this comes with issues such as incorrect ratings, reviews or
anything that is being shared. Recommendation systems are powerful tools that
help users by providing them with meaningful recommendations. A straightforward
approach would be to predict the scores of video games based on other
information related to the game. It could be used as a means to validate
user-submitted ratings as well as provide recommendations. This work provides a
method to predict the G-Score, that defines how good a video game is, from its
trailer (video) and summary (text). We first propose models to predict the
G-Score based on the trailer alone (unimodal). Later on, we show that
considering information from multiple modalities helps the models perform
better compared to using information from videos alone. Since we couldn't find
any suitable multimodal video game dataset, we created our own dataset named
VGD (Video Game Dataset) and provide it along with this work. The approach
mentioned here can be generalized to other multimodal datasets such as movie
trailers and summaries etc. Towards the end, we talk about the shortcomings of
the work and some methods to overcome them.

multidimensional examples. The method uses a tensor representation of the
example, which helps in capturing the dimensionality as well as the structure
of the example, and applies tensor operations to find the constraints that are
satisfied by the example. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we used
constraints from the Nurse Rostering Competition and generated solutions that
satisfy these constraints; these solutions were then used as examples to learn
constraints. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is capable of
producing human readable constraints that capture the underlying

at efficient sampling of high-dimensional state spaces with a limited number of
particles. Particles are pushed forward from the prior to the posterior density
using a sequence of mappings that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence
between the posterior and the sequence of intermediate densities. The sequence
of mappings represents a gradient flow. A key ingredient of the mappings is
that they are embedded in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which allows for
a practical and efficient algorithm. The embedding provides a direct means to
calculate the gradient of the Kullback-Leibler divergence leading to quick
convergence using well-known gradient-based stochastic optimization algorithms.
Evaluation of the method is conducted in the chaotic Lorenz-63 system, the
Lorenz-96 system, which is a coarse prototype of atmospheric dynamics, and an
epidemic model that describes cholera dynamics. No resampling is required in
the mapping particle filter even for long recursive sequences. The number of
effective particles remains close to the total number of particles in all the
experiments.

fundamental understanding of spin-orbitronis as well as the development of
efficient means to manipulate the magnetization. We report the direct spatial
imaging of current induced spin accumulation at the channel edges of Bi2Se3 and
BiSbTeSe2 topological insulators by a scanning photovoltage microscope at room
temperature. The spin polarization is along the out-of-plane direction with
opposite signs for the two channel edges. The accumulated spin direction
reverses sign upon changing the current direction and the detected spin signal
shows a linear dependence on the magnitude of currents, which indicates that
our observed phenomena are the current induced effects. The spin Hall angle of
Bi2Se3 and BiSbTeSe2 is determined to be 0.0085 and 0.0616, respectively. We
further image the current induced spin accumulation in a Pt heavy metal. Our
results open up the possibility of optically detecting the current induced spin
accumulations, and thus point towards a better understanding of the interaction
between spins and circularly polarized light.

the proof of uniqueness theorems of black holes. We generalize the divergence
equation originally discovered by Robinson in four dimensional vacuum
spacetimes into several directions. We find that the deviation from spherical
symmetry is encoded in a symmetric trace-free tensor $H_{ij}$ on a static
timeslice. This tensor is the crux for the construction of the desired
divergence equation, which allows us to conclude the uniqueness of the
Schwarzschild black hole without using Smarr's integration mass formula. In
Einstein-Maxwell(-dilaton) theory, we apply the maximal principle for a number
of divergence equations to prove the uniqueness theorem of static black holes.
In higher $(n\ge 5)$ dimensional vacuum spacetimes, a central obstruction for
applicability of the current proof is the integration of the
$(n-2)$-dimensional scalar curvature over the horizon cross-section, which has
been evaluated to be a topological constant by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for
$n=4$. Nevertheless, it turns out that the $(n-1)$-dimensional symmetric and
traceless tensor $H_{ij}$ is still instrumental for the modification of the
uniqueness proof based upon the positive mass theorem, as well as for the
derivation of the Penrose-type inequality.

understand the impact of various configuration parameters such as block size,
endorsement policy, channels, resource allocation, state database choice on the

aggressive caching for endorsement policy verification in the cryptography

field of computer vision. However, it is still a big challenge to deploy these
deep models on resource-constrained embedded devices such as mobile robots,
smart phones and so on. Therefore, network compression for such platforms is a
reasonable solution to reduce memory consumption and computation complexity. In
this paper, a novel channel pruning method based on genetic algorithm is
proposed to compress very deep Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs). Firstly, a
pre-trained CNN model is pruned layer by layer according to the sensitivity of
each layer. After that, the pruned model is fine-tuned based on knowledge
distillation framework. These two improvements significantly decrease the model
redundancy with less accuracy drop. Channel selection is a combinatorial
optimization problem that has exponential solution space. In order to
accelerate the selection process, the proposed method formulates it as a search
problem, which can be solved efficiently by genetic algorithm. Meanwhile, a
two-step approximation fitness function is designed to further improve the
efficiency of genetic process. The proposed method has been verified on three
benchmark datasets with two popular CNN models: VGGNet and ResNet. On the
CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets, our approach outperforms several
state-of-the-art methods. On the CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets, the pruned VGGNet

presence of a metallicity spread in G280. When using the most recent version of
the Kurucz line list, we measure iron abundances of [Fe/H]=-0.68+/-0.02 from
the optical spectrum and [Fe/H]=-0.60+/-0.07 from the infrared spectrum. These
values agree well with previous spectroscopic determinations of the metallicity
of G280. While the small difference between the optical and infrared
measurements is insignificant given the uncertainties, it is also consistent
with a metallicity spread similar to that observed in massive GCs such as Omega
Cen and G1, and also hinted at by the colour-magnitude diagram of G280. The
optical and infrared spectra both indicate an alpha-enhancement of about
0.3-0.4 dex relative to solar-scaled abundances, as typically also observed in
Milky Way GCs. It appears that our integrated-light analysis technique also
performs well in the H-band. However, complications due to the presence of
molecular bands and telluric contamination are more severe in the infrared, and
accurate modelling of the coolest giants is more critical.

Universality. Any deviation from this prediction would indicate the existence
of physics beyond the Standard Model. Recent LHCb measurements present a
pattern of deviations from this prediction in rare B-meson decays. While not
yet statistically significant (currently $2.2-2.6 \sigma$), these measurements
show an imbalance in the ratio of B-meson decays to a pair of muons in
association with a Kaon and decays to a pair of electrons in association with a
Kaon. If the measured deviations are indeed present in nature, new physics may
mediate interactions involving a pair of same flavour leptons, a $b$- and an
$s$-quark. We present the prospect for a search of new physics in this type of
interactions at the LHC, in a process that involves an $s$-quark, and a final
state with two leptons and a $b$-jet. The proposed search can improve the
sensitivity to new physics in these processes by a factor of four compared to
current searches with in the total dataset expected at the LHC.

  However, in real applications with high dimensional data we expect it is only
important to approximate the desired function well on certain relevant parts of
its domain. With this motivation, we analyze the ability of neural networks and
polynomial kernels of bounded degree to achieve good statistical performance on
a simple, natural inference problem with sparse latent structure. We give
almost-tight bounds on the performance of both neural networks and low degree

discordant interpretations of Landau damping still present after seventy years.
For long deemed impossible, the mechanical N-body description of this damping,
not only enables its rigorous and simple calculation, but makes unequivocal and
intuitive its interpretation as the synchronization of almost resonant passing
particles. This synchronization justifies mechanically why a single formula
applies to both Landau growth and damping. As to the electrostatic potential,
the phase mixing of many beam modes produces Landau damping, but it is
unexpectedly essential for Landau growth too. Moreover, collisions play an
essential role in collisionless plasmas. In particular, Debye shielding results
from a cooperative dynamical self-organization process, where ""collisional""
deflections due to a given electron diminish the apparent number of charges
about it. The finite value of exponentiation rates due to collisions is crucial
for the equivalent of the van Kampen phase mixing to occur in the N-body
system. The N-body approach incorporates spontaneous emission naturally, whose
compound effect with Landau damping drives a thermalization of Langmuir waves.
O'Neil's damping with trapping typical of initially large enough Langmuir waves
results from a phase transition. As to collisional transport, there is a smooth
connection between impact parameters where the two-body Rutherford picture is
correct, and those where a collective description is mandatory. The N-body
approach reveals two important features of the Vlasovian limit: it is singular
and it corresponds to a renormalized description of the actual N-body dynamics.

stationary scalar fields in incompressible turbulence. The new method can
produce more general scalar PDFs (e.g. double-delta) than current methods,
while ensuring that scalar fields remain bounded. Such features are useful for
generating initial fields in non-premixed combustion or for studying
non-Gaussian scalar turbulence. The RA method mathematically models
hypothetical chemical reactions that convert reactants in a mixed state back
into its pure unmixed components. Various types of chemical reactions are
formulated and the corresponding mathematical expressions derived such that the
reaction term is smooth in the scalar space and is consistent with mass
conservation. For large values of the scalar dissipation rate, the method
produces statistically steady double-delta scalar PDFs. Quasi-uniform,
Gaussian, and stretched exponential scalar statistics are recovered for smaller
values of the scalar dissipation rate. The shape of the scalar PDF can be
further controlled by changing the stoichiometric coefficients of the reaction.
The ability of the new method to produce fully developed passive scalar fields
with quasi-Gaussian PDFs is also investigated, by exploring the convergence of
the third order mixed structure function to the ""four-thirds"" Yaglom's law.

We do that by replacing scalar field over points with scalar field over edges,
where the edges are taken to be very long rather than very short. In
particular, they are much longer than the size of the laboratory. Due to their
large length, we can single out the edges that are almost parallel to each
other, and then use directional derivatives in the direction of those edges (as
opposed to d'Alembertian) along with a constraint that the derivatives are
small in the direction perpendicular to those edges, in order to come up with a
plane wave. The scalar field is thought to reside at the future end of those
edges, which renders the seemingly nonlocal effects of their large length as
physically irrelevant. After that we add by hand the interaction of those plane
waves that would amount to 4-vertex coupling of plane waves.

global symmetry group of such systems has a 't Hooft anomaly, which manifests
itself as an inability to gauge the global symmetry group. By applying anomaly
matching, the ground-state properties can be severely constrained. The anomaly
matching is an avatar of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem for the spin
chain from which the field theory descends, and it forbids a trivially gapped
ground state for particular $\theta$-angles. We generalize the statement of the
LSM theorem and show that 't Hooft anomalies persist even under perturbations
which break the spin-symmetry down to the discrete subgroup $\mathbb
Z_3\times\mathbb Z_3\subset SU(3)/\mathbb Z_3$. In addition the model can
further be constrained by applying global inconsistency matching, which
indicates the presence of a phase transition between different regions of
$\theta$-angles. We use these constraints to give possible scenarios of the

the anomalies are matched by the $SU(3)$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model. We
generalize the discussion to the $SU(N)/U(1)^{N-1}$ nonlinear sigma models as

this last class, pole ladder is a simplification of Schild's ladder for the
parallel transport along geodesics that was shown to be particularly simple and
numerically stable in Lie groups. So far, these methods were shown to be first
order approximations of the Riemannian parallel transport, but higher order
error terms are difficult to establish. In this paper, we build on a BCH-type
formula on affine connection spaces to establish the behavior of one pole

According to our analysis of the $t$-$J$-$U$ model, the transition between the
pure $d$-$wave$ superconducting phase (SC) and the coexistent CDW+PDW phase
takes place at $\delta\approx 0.18$ (close to the optimal doping), with the
modulated phase located in the underdoped regime. The situation is slightly
different for the case of the Hubbard model, where a narrow stability regime of
a precursor nematic phase sets in preceding the formation of the modulated
CDW+PDW state, with the decreasing hole doping. The results complete our

conditions. The ketamine responses were measured by EEG signals and Hamilton
Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores. At baseline, responders showed a
significantly weaker EEG theta power than did non- responders (p < 0.05).
Responders exhibited a higher EEG alpha power but lower EEG alpha asymmetry and

They are important because they influence many physical properties of the

permeability that is accompanied by ion-channel-like phenomena even in the

procedure of the Long-Term Evolution (LTE) standard is known to represent a
serious bottleneck in case of machine-type traffic. Its main drawbacks are seen
in the facts that Base Stations (eNBs) typically cannot infer the number of
collided User Equipments (UEs) and that collided UEs learn about the collision
only implicitly, through the lack of the feedback in the later stage of the
RACH procedure. The collided UEs then restart the procedure, thereby increasing
the RACH load and making the system more prone to collisions. In this paper, we
leverage machine learning techniques to design a system that outperforms the
state-of-the-art schemes in preamble detection for the LTE RACH procedure. Most
importantly, our scheme can also estimate the collision multiplicity, and thus
gather information about how many devices chose the same preamble. This data
can be used by the eNB to resolve collisions, increase the supported system
load and reduce transmission latency. The presented approach is applicable to

The most important result obtained in this paper is on the finite Fourier

Thus the truncation provides a reasonable approximation, and could be applied

reduces to the A- or B-models on the boundary. We introduce S-duality at the
level of the membrane sigma-model based on the generalized complex structure,
which exchanges the related AKSZ field theories, and interpret it as
topological S-duality of the A- and B-models. Our approach leads to new classes
of Courant algebroids associated to (generalized) complex geometry.

proposed as model for the evolution of the density distribution of frequencies
with which different strategies are pursued in a population obeying the rules
of replicator dynamics in a continuous infinite-dimensional setting. Firstly,
for all positive initial data $u_0\in C^0(\mathbb{R}^n)$ satisfying $u_0\in
L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for some $p\in (0,1)$ as well as $\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}

global positive classical solution with the property that $\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}
u(\cdot,t)=1$ for all $t>0$. Thereafter, the main purpose of this work consists
in revealing a dependence of the large time behavior of these solutions on the
spatial decay of the initial data in a direction that seems unexpected when
viewed against the background of known behavior in large classes of scalar
parabolic problems. In fact, it is shown that all considered solutions
asymptotically decay with respect to their spatial $H^1$ norm, so that \[
\mathcal{E}(t):=\int_0^t \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} |\nabla u(\cdot,t)|^2, \qquad t>0,

the initial data in such a way that fast decay rates of $u_0$ enforce rapid
growth of $\mathcal{E}$. To this end, examples of algebraical and certain

logarithmic and arbitrary sublinear algebraic growth rates of $\mathcal{E}$,

particular ordering of the operators of observables of momenta and coordinates.
  It is shown that the Schrodinger approach in the standard paradigm of quantum
mechanics determines uniquely the ordering selected by DeWitt among a continuum
of other possibilties to determine the quantum Hamiltonian.
  Two particular classes of observables of localization in $V_n$ are considered
in detail. It is shown that, in general, the quantum-mechanical potential does
not vanish even in the Euclidean configuration space $V_n$ except the case when
Cartesian coordinates are taken as the observables of localization of the

quantization considered by DeWitt in 1957, the quantum Green function
(propagator) is also non-unique and depends on the choice of a line in $V_n$
connecting these points. All three formalisms have the same local asymtotics of
the quantum Hamiltonian if the normal Riemannian cordinates are used, at least
implicitly, to localize the system in $V_n$.

study von Neumann algebras in an abstract categorical setting. In combination
with previous work this characterizes EJAs as the most general systems allowed
in a generalized probabilistic theory that is simultaneously a dagger-effectus.
Using the dagger structure we get a notion of dagger-positive maps of the form
f = g*g. We give a complete characterization of the pure dagger-positive maps

sequential product that maps (a,b) to sqrt(a) b sqrt(a). The notion of

the mass spectrum is fixed. As a case study, we test it with a sample of four
quadruple lenses, both in simulated scenarios and with real data from the
$\textit{Chandra X-ray Observatory}$. In our simulations with a uniform stellar
population the method works best to detect sources around $0.1$ Einstein radii,
giving correct upper/lower limits for much smaller/bigger sizes without
requiring a big leap in additional computational effort as compared to a
single-epoch approach, yet taking advantage of multi-epoch information. We
apply the method to a small sample of X-ray data from four objects assuming a
range of star masses, and obtain a degeneracy relation between the source size
and deflector mass. Combined with previous estimates for the size of the X-ray
corona, the degeneracy relation suggests that X-ray microlensing is mainly
induced by planetary mass objects.

predicting a noisy label. This reveals conditions under which a classifier
trained with imperfect labels remains consistent for classifying uncorrupted
test data points. Furthermore, under stronger conditions, we derive detailed
asymptotic properties for the popular $k$-nearest neighbour ($k$nn), support
vector machine (SVM) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifiers. One
consequence of these results is that the knn and SVM classifiers are robust to
imperfect training labels, in the sense that the rate of convergence of the
excess risks of these classifiers remains unchanged; in fact, our theoretical
and empirical results even show that in some cases, imperfect labels may
improve the performance of these methods. On the other hand, the LDA classifier
is shown to be typically inconsistent in the presence of label noise unless the
prior probabilities of each class are equal. Our theoretical results are

list at all, which list specifically, and the date of list creation. We find
that (i) top lists generally overestimate results compared to the general
population by a significant margin, often even an order of magnitude, and (ii)
some top lists have surprising change characteristics, causing high day-to-day
fluctuation and leading to result instability. We conclude our paper with
specific recommendations on the use of top lists, and how to interpret results
based on top lists with caution.

key role in the understanding of star formation and provide us with an
excellent tool to study fundamental properties of HMYSOs.
  Aims: We aim at studying the physical and kinematic properties of the near-IR
(NIR) jet of IRAS\,13481-6124 from au to parsec scales.
  Methods: Our study includes NIR data from the Very Large Telescope
instruments SINFONI, CRIRES, and ISAAC. Information about the source and its
immediate environment is retrieved with SINFONI. The technique of
spectro-astrometry is performed with CRIRES to study the jet on au scales. The
parsec-scale jet and its kinematic and dynamic properties are investigated
using ISAAC.
  Results: The SINFONI spectra in the $H$ and $K$ band are rich in emission
lines that are mainly associated with ejection and accretion processes.
Spectro-astrometry is applied to the Br$\gamma$ line, and for the first time,
to the Br$\alpha$ line, revealing their jet origin with milliarcsecond-scale
photocentre displacements ($11-15$\,au). This allows us to constrain the
kinematics of the au-scale jet and to derive its position angle
($\sim216^{\circ}$). ISAAC spectroscopy reveals H$_2$ emission along the
parsec-scale jet, which allows us to infer kinematic and dynamic properties of
the NIR parsec-scale jet. The mass-loss rate inferred for the NIR jet is
$\dot{M}_\mathrm{ejec}\sim10^{-4}\mathrm{\,M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$ and the thrust is
$\dot{P}\sim10^{-2}\mathrm{\,M_\odot\,yr^{-1}\,km\,s^{-1}}$ , which is roughly
constant for the formation history of the young star. A tentative estimate of
the ionisation fraction is derived for the massive jet by comparing the radio
and NIR mass-loss rates. An ionisation fraction $\lesssim8\%$ is obtained,
which means that the bulk of the ejecta is traced by the NIR jet and that the
radio jet only delineates a small portion of it.

need to be processed automatically. However, those videos or images are usually

the tuples (x_1,...,x_{k+1}) in G^{k+1} for which the simple commutator
[x_1,...,x_{k+1}] is equal to the identity. In this paper we study versions of
this for an infinite group G, with the degree of nilpotence defined by sampling
G in various natural ways, such as with a random walk, or with a Folner
sequence if G is amenable. In our first main result we show that if G is
finitely generated then the degree of k-step nilpotence is positive if and only
if G is virtually k-step nilpotent. This generalises both an earlier result of
the second author treating the case k=1 and a result of Shalev for finite
groups, and uses techniques from both of these earlier results. We also show,
using the notion of polynomial mappings of groups developed by Leibman and
others, that to a large extent the degree of nilpotence does not depend on the
method of sampling. As part of our argument we generalise a result of Leibman
by showing that if f is a polynomial mapping into a torsion-free nilpotent
group then the set of roots of f is sparse in a certain sense. In our second
main result we consider the case where G is residually finite but not
necessarily finitely generated. Here we show that if the degree of k-step
nilpotence of the finite quotients of G is uniformly bounded from below then G
is virtually k-step nilpotent, answering a question of Shalev. As part of our
proof we show that degree of nilpotence of finite groups is sub-multiplicative
with respect to quotients, generalising a result of Gallagher.

stage (normal, early or moderate) and severity of PD using machine learning
techniques such as ordinal logistic regression (OLR), support vector machine

importance in PD is also estimated using Random forests. We observe that the
predictive models of SVM, Adaboost-based ensemble, Random forests and

it hears. Choosing from a discrete set of actions - the notes to play on its
instrument - the amount of reward the agent experiences depends on which notes
it plays and when. This process resembles how a human musician might approach
the task of transcription, and the satisfaction she achieves by closely
mimicking the sound source to transcribe on her instrument. Following a
discussion of the theoretical framework and the benefits of modelling the
problem in this way, we focus our attention on several practical considerations
and address the difficulties in training an agent to acceptable performance on
a set of tasks with increasing difficulty. We demonstrate promising results in
partially constrained environments.

means to include the inflaton field within the well understood Standard Model

due to the requirement of large non-minimal coupling to the curvature scalar of
the inflaton field, or in this case the Higgs field, this model suffers from a

the hope of gathering enough linearly independent combinations so as to
eventually recover all individual packets through the resolution of a linear

theoretical work has brought into question the validity of applying this

today. Based on electron back-scattering at sharp nanometre-scale metal tips, a
method is available to measure light fields with sub-wavelength spatial
resolution and sub-optical cycle time resolution. Here we report such a direct,
three-dimensional measurement of the spatial dependence of the optical phase of
a focused, 4-fs, near-infrared laser pulse. The observed optical phase deviates
substantially from the monochromatic Gouy phase - exhibiting a much more

user profiling and match-making within a unified end-to-end framework.
CoupleNet utilizes hierarchical recurrent neural models for learning
representations of user profiles and subsequently coupled attention mechanisms
to fuse information aggregated from two users. To the best of our knowledge,

described by the integrable Lieb-Lininger model. Realistic systems, as they can
be implemented, are only approximately integrable, and let us investigate the
cross over to 'thermalisation'. They show such fundamental properties as
pre-thermalisation, general Gibbs ensembles and light-cone like spreading of
de-coherence. On the other hand they are complex enough to illustrate that our
limited ability to measure only (local) few-body observables determines the
relevant description of the many-body system and its physics. One consequence
is the observation of quantum recurrences in systems with thousand of
interacting particles. The relaxation observed in 1D superfluids is universal
for a large class of many-body systems, those where the relevant physics can be
described by a set of 'long lived' collective modes. The time window where the
'close to integrable' dynamics can be observed is given by the 'lifetime' of
the quasi-particles associated with the collective modes. Based on these
observations one can view (in a quantum field theory sense) a many-body quantum
system at T=0 as 'vacuum' and its excitations as the system to experiment with.
This viewpoint leads to a new way to build thermal machines from the
quasi-particles in 1D superfluids. We will give examples of how to realise
these systems and point to a few interesting questions that might be addressed.

experience, thereby provisions opportunity for artificial intelligence
applications in healthcare. Previous works have mainly framed patient-clinician
interactions as Markov decision processes, while true physiological states are
not necessarily fully observable from clinical data. We capture this situation
with partially observable Markov decision process, in which an agent optimises
its actions in a belief represented as a distribution of patient states
inferred from individual history trajectories. A Gaussian mixture model is
fitted for the observed data. Moreover, we take into account the fact that
nuance in pharmaceutical dosage could presumably result in significantly
different effect by modelling a continuous policy through a Gaussian
approximator directly in the policy space, i.e. the actor. To address the
challenge of infinite number of possible belief states which renders exact
value iteration intractable, we evaluate and plan for only every encountered
belief, through heuristic search tree by tightly maintaining lower and upper
bounds of the true value of belief. We further resort to function
approximations to update value bounds estimation, i.e. the critic, so that the
tree search can be improved through more compact bounds at the fringe nodes
that will be back-propagated to the root. Both actor and critic parameters are
learned via gradient-based approaches. Our proposed policy trained from real
intensive care unit data is capable of dictating dosing on vasopressors and
intravenous fluids for sepsis patients that lead to the best patient outcomes.

corners adjacent to the boundary, the subleading term is a logarithmic

synchronisation, making these species the ideal choice for domestication as
livestock for humans. However, livestock populations are not self-regulated,
and farmers transfer individuals across different groups throughout their lives
for reasons such as genetic mixing, reproduction and pastureland management.
Individuals consequently have to adapt to different group compositions during
their lives rather than choose their own herd mates, as they would do in the
wild. These changes may lead to social instability and stress, entailing
potentially negative effects on animal welfare. In this study, we assess how
the transfer of Highland cattle (Bos taurus) impacts individual and group
social network measures. Four groups with nine different compositions and 18
individual transfers were studied to evaluate 1) the effect of group
composition on individual social centralities and 2) the effect of group
composition changes on these centralities. As shown in previous works, dyadic
associations are stronger between individuals with similar age and dominance
rank. This study reveals that the relative stability of dyadic spatial
relationships between changes in group composition or enclosure is due to the
identities of transferred individuals more than the quantity of individuals
that are transferred. Older cattle had higher network centralities than other
individuals. The centrality of individuals was also affected by their sex and
the number of familiar individuals in the group. This study reveals the
necessity of understanding the social structure of a group to predict social
instability following the transfer of individuals between groups. The
developing of guidelines for the modification of group composition could
improve livestock management and reduce stress for the animals concerned.

to enlarge parameter domains for which optimal ratchet currents (RCs) are
obtained. This task is performed by adding a suitable periodic perturbation
$F_j$ on a Ratchet mapping and the procedure consists in multiplying a
particular class of generic Isoperiodic Stable Structures (ISSs), since the
existence of non-zero RCs is directly related to the occurrence of stable
domains. By proliferating the ISSs, it is possible to: (i) postpone thermal
effects that usually increase the chaotic domain and (ii) demonstrate, by using
a quantitative analysis, that the area which provides optimal RCs in the
two-dimensional parameter space can be enlarged about $78\%$. In addition, for
some specific parameter combinations, non-zero RCs can be induced through the
birth of a new attractor, which moves away as the strength of $F_j$ increases.
Clearly, the methodology applied to the ratchet mapping is an efficient way to
deal with unavoidable thermal effects and its consequent undesirable dynamics,
specially in experimental setups. As a second general remark, we conclude that
our main findings can be extended to issues related to transport problems.

curvilinear surface coordinates as used in the classical shell theory.
Therefore, the proposed TDC-based formulation also applies to shell geometries
which are zero-isosurfaces as in the level-set method where no parametrization
is available in general. For the discretization, the TDC-based formulation may
be used based on surface meshes implying element-wise parametrizations. Then,
the results are equivalent to those obtained based on the classical theory.
However, it may also be used in recent finite element approaches as the
TraceFEM and CutFEM where shape functions are generated on a background mesh
without any need for a parametrization. Numerical results presented herein are
achieved with isogeometric analysis for classical and new benchmark tests.
Higher-order convergence rates in the residual errors are achieved when the
physical fields are sufficiently smooth.

contract. This framework is very useful for valuing outstanding derivatives.
Using a unique dataset, we find empirical evidence that credit risk alone is
not overly important in determining credit-related spreads. Only accounting for
both collateral posting and credit risk can sufficiently explain unsecured
credit costs. This finding suggests that failure to properly account for
collateralization may result in significant mispricing of derivatives. We also
empirically gauge the impact of collateral agreements on risk measurements. Our
findings indicate that there are important interactions between market and
