support systems. Within computer vision, they are critical in certain tasks
related to human behavior analysis such as in health care applications. Despite
their importance, it is only recently that researchers are starting to explore
these aspects. This paper provides an introduction to explainability and
interpretability in the context of computer vision with an emphasis on looking
at people tasks. Specifically, we review and study those mechanisms in the
context of first impressions analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first effort in this direction. Additionally, we describe a challenge we
organized on explainability in first impressions analysis from video. We
analyze in detail the newly introduced data set, the evaluation protocol, and
summarize the results of the challenge. Finally, derived from our study, we
outline research opportunities that we foresee will be decisive in the near
future for the development of the explainable computer vision field.

all high-energy phenomena. Both pre-existing large-scale magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) turbulence and locally generated turbulence through plasma instabilities
are important for the CR propagation in astrophysical media. The potential role
of the resonant instability triggered by CR pressure anisotropy to regulate the
parallel spatial diffusion of low-energy CRs ($\lesssim 100$ GeV) in the
interstellar and intracluster medium of galaxies (ISM and ICM) has been showed
in previous theoretical works. This work aims to study the gyroresonance
instability via direct numerical simulations, in order to access quantitatively
the wave-particle scattering rates. For this we employ a 1D PIC-MHD code to
follow the growth and saturation of the gyroresonance instability. We extract
from the simulations the pitch-angle diffusion coefficient $D_{\mu\mu}$
produced by the instability during the linear and saturation phases, and a very
good agreement (within a factor of 3) is found with the values predicted by the
quasilinear theory (QLT). Our results support the applicability of the QLT for
modeling the scattering of low-energy CRs by the gyroresonance instability in
the complex interplay between this instability and the large-scale MHD
turbulence.

many problems in computer science. In particular, graph games with
$\omega$-regular winning conditions, specified as parity objectives, which can
express properties such as safety, liveness, fairness, are the basic framework
for verification and synthesis of reactive systems. The decisions for a player
at various states of the graph game are represented as strategies. While the
algorithmic problem for solving graph games with parity objectives has been
widely studied, the most prominent data-structure for strategy representation
in graph games has been binary decision diagrams (BDDs). However, due to the
bit-level representation, BDDs do not retain the inherent flavor of the
decisions of strategies, and are notoriously hard to minimize to obtain
succinct representation. In this work we propose decision trees for strategy
representation in graph games. Decision trees retain the flavor of decisions of
strategies and allow entropy-based minimization to obtain succinct trees.
However, decision trees work in settings (e.g., probabilistic models) where
errors are allowed, and overfitting of data is typically avoided. In contrast,
for strategies in graph games no error is allowed, and the decision tree must
represent the entire strategy. We develop new techniques to extend decision
trees to overcome the above obstacles, while retaining the entropy-based
techniques to obtain succinct trees. We have implemented our techniques to
extend the existing decision tree solvers. We present experimental results for
problems in reactive synthesis to show that decision trees provide a much more
efficient data-structure for strategy representation as compared to BDDs.

${\rm d}\sigma_{\rm {b\overline{b}}}/{\rm d} y$, and the total cross section
extrapolated over full phase space, $\sigma_{\rm {b\overline{b}}}$, are
obtained. This measurement is combined with results on inclusive J/$\psi$
production to determine the prompt J/$\psi$ cross sections. The results in p-Pb
collisions are then scaled to expectations from pp collisions at the same
centre-of-mass energy to derive the nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm pPb}$,
and compared to models to study possible nuclear modifications of the
production induced by cold nuclear matter effects. $R_{\rm pPb}$ is found to be
smaller than unity at low $p_{\rm T}$ for both J/$\psi$ coming from beauty

porous crystal structures. In the early stages, we show that nucleation
requires a structural reorganization of the liquid phase, called stress-driven
ageing. Once nucleation starts, we observe that crystallization follows three
different routes: direct crystallization of the liquid phase, Bergeron process,

crystals grow past it by direct condensation of the gas phase on their surface,
driving liquid evaporation, and producing a network structure different from
the original phase separation pattern. We argue that similar crystal-gel states
can be formed in monoatomic and molecular systems if the liquid phase is slow
enough to induce viscoelastic phase separation, but fast enough to prevent
immediate vitrification. This provides a novel pathway to form nano-porous
crystals of metals and semiconductors without dealloying, which may be
important for catalytic, optical, sensing, and filtration applications.

limit has an important implication for the QCD phase diagram. We carry out
lattice QCD simulations in an attempt to address this problem. Simulations are
conducted with a Symanzik-improved gauge action and the HISQ fermion action.
Within the imaginary chemical potential formulation, five different quark
masses, $am=0.020,\, 0.018, \, 0.015, \, 0.013,\, 0.010$, and four different
lattice volumes $N_s=8, \, 12,\, 16, \, 20$ with temporal extent $N_t=4$ are
used to explore the scaling behavior. At each of the quark masses, the Binder
cumulants of the chiral condensate on different lattice volumes approximately
intersect at one point. We find that at the intersection point, the Binder
cumulant $B_4(am,a\mu_c) $ is around $3$ which deviates from the $Z(2)$
universality class value 1.604. However, based on the expectations of $Z(2)$
criticality, the fitting result only with the data from the largest lattice
volume $N_s=20$ agrees well with earlier result [ Phys. Rev., D90, 074030(2014)

effects could be reduced with HISQ fermions even on $N_t=4$ lattices, larger
lattices with spatial extent $N_s>=20$ for such studies are needed to control
finite volume effects.

applications and diverse methods have been developed for this purpose. These
methods are based on a physical understanding of the underlying behavior of the
flow in the vicinity of the feature. Particularly, they rely on definition of
suitable criteria (i.e. point-based or neighborhood-based derived properties)
and proper selection of thresholds. For instance, among other techniques,
vortex identification can be done through computing the Q-criterion or by
considering the center of looping streamlines. However, these methods rely on
creative visualization of physical idiosyncrasies of specific features and flow
regimes, making them non-universal and requiring significant effort to develop.
Here we present a physics-based, data-driven method capable of identifying any
flow feature it is trained to. We use convolutional neural networks, a machine
learning approach developed for image recognition, and adapt it to the problem
of identifying flow features. The method was tested using mean flow fields from
numerical simulations, where the recirculation region and boundary layer were
identified in a two-dimensional flow through a convergent-divergent channel,
and the horseshoe vortex was identified in three-dimensional flow over a
wing-body junction. The novelty of the method is its ability to identify any
type of feature, even distinguish between similar ones, without the need to
explicitly define the physics (i.e. through development of suitable criterion
and tunning of threshold). This provides a general method and removes the large
burden placed on identifying new features. We expect this method can supplement
existing techniques and allow for more automatic and discerning feature
detection. The method can be easily extended to time-dependent flows, where it
could be particularly impactful.

part dedicated to computational color constancy i.e. to removing the influence
of illumination on the colors of the image scene. Some of the best known
illumination estimation methods are the so called statistics-based methods.
They are less accurate than the learning-based illumination estimation methods,
but they are faster and simpler to implement in embedded systems, which is one
of the reasons for their widespread usage. Although in the relevant literature
it often appears as if they require no training, this is not true because they
have parameter values that need to be fine-tuned in order to be more accurate.
In this paper it is first shown that the accuracy of statistics-based methods
reported in most papers was not obtained by means of the necessary
cross-validation, but by using the whole benchmark datasets for both training
and testing. After that the corrected results are given for the best known
benchmark datasets. Finally, the so called green stability assumption is
proposed that can be used to fine-tune the values of the parameters of the
statistics-based methods by using only non-calibrated images without known
ground-truth illumination. The obtained accuracy is practically the same as
when using calibrated training images, but the whole process is much faster.

quantum state, can one determine if a joint state exists? We derive necessary
conditions for this to be true. In contrast to what is known as the quantum
marginal problem, we consider a setting where the labeling of the subsystems is
unknown. The problem can be seen in analogy to Ulam's reconstruction conjecture
in graph theory. The conjecture - still unsolved - claims that every graph on
at least three vertices can uniquely be reconstructed from the set of its
vertex-deleted subgraphs. When considering quantum states, we demonstrate that
the non-existence of joint states can, in some cases, already be inferred from
a set of marginals having the size of just more than half of the parties. We
apply these methods to graph states, where many constraints can be evaluated by
knowing the number of stabilizer elements of certain weights that appear in the
reductions. This perspective links with constraints that were derived in the
context of quantum error-correcting codes and polynomial invariants. Some of
these constraints can be interpreted as monogamy-like relations that limit the
correlations arising from quantum states. Lastly, we provide an answer to
Ulam's reconstruction problem for generic quantum states.

perovskite oxides. We focus on the short-period, perfectly antiphase or
in-phase, tilt patterns that characterize most compounds and control their
physical (e.g., conductive, magnetic) properties. Based on an analytical form
of the relevant potential energy surface, we discuss the conditions for the
stability of polymorphs presenting different tilt patterns, and obtain
numerical results for a collection of thirty-five representative materials. Our
results reveal the mechanisms responsible for the frequent occurrence of a
particular structure that combines antiphase and in-phase rotations, i.e., the
orthorhombic Pbnm phase displayed by about half of all perovskite oxides and by
many non-oxidic perovskites. The Pbnm phase benefits from the simultaneous
occurrence of antiphase and in-phase tilt patterns that compete with each
other, but not as strongly as to be mutually exclusive. We also find that
secondary antipolar modes, involving the A cations, contribute to weaken the
competition between different tilts and play a key role in their coexistence.
Our results thus confirm and better explain previous observations for
particular compounds. Interestingly, we also find that strain effects, which
are known to be a major factor governing phase competition in related (e.g.,
ferroelectric) perovskite oxides, play no essential role as regards the
relative stability of different rotational polymorphs. Further, we discuss why
the Pbnm structure stops being the ground state in two opposite limits, for
large and small A cations, showing that very different effects become relevant
in each case. Our work thus provides a comprehensive discussion on these
all-important and abundant materials, which will be useful to better understand

single aspect of the model: the ability to accommodate $z>10$ component to the
ionization as we illustrate with a two-step reionization model. For this and
other models that accommodate such a component, its presence is allowed and
even favored; for models that do not, their poor fit reflects statistical or

date from an AGN - an origin due to thermal Comptonization would imply a
remarkably low coronal temperature $kT \sim 15$ keV. The low energy peak of the
spectrum in the hard X-ray NuSTAR band, which peaks before the expected onset
of a Compton hump, rules out strong reflection as the origin of the hard excess
in this AGN. We show the origin of the high energy rollover is likely due to a
combination of both thermal Comptonization and an intrinsically steeper
continuum, which is modified by absorption at lower energies. Furthermore,
modeling the broadband XUV continuum shape as a colour-corrected accretion
disc, requires the presence of a variable warm absorber to explain all flux and
spectral states of the source, consistent with the previous work on this AGN.
While absorber variations produce marked spectral variability in this AGN,
consideration of all flux states allows us to isolate a colourless component of
variability that may arise from changes in the inner accretion flow, typically
at around $10 \, r_g$.

black holes. Scrambling can be measured using out-of-time-ordered correlators
(OTOCs), which are closely tied to the growth of Heisenberg operators. In this
work, we present a general method to calculate OTOCs of local operators in
local one-dimensional systems based on approximating Heisenberg operators as
matrix-product operators (MPOs). Contrary to the common belief that such tensor
network methods work only at early times, we show that the entire early growth
region of the OTOC can be captured using an MPO approximation with modest bond
dimension. We analytically establish the goodness of the approximation by
showing that if an appropriate OTOC is close to its initial value, then the
associated Heisenberg operator has low entanglement across a given cut. We use
the method to study scrambling in a chaotic spin chain with $201$ sites. Based
on this data and OTOC results for black holes, local random circuit models, and
non-interacting systems, we conjecture a universal form for the dynamics of the

simulations and empirical relations between halo mass and the globular cluster
(GC) abundance to study the kinematical properties of halo GCs in massive
galaxies, with $M_{vir}(z=0)=10^{13.5}M_\odot$. While the accreted stellar halo
is dominated by the contributions of massive satellites, we show that
satellites with low virial mass (i.e. low satellite-to-host virial mass ratio,
VMRs) are important contributors to the population of accreted GCs. The
relative contribution of accretion events with low VMRs is highest for the halo
population of blue GCs and gradually decreases for red GCs and accreted stars.
As a consequence of the reduced efficiency of dynamical friction on minor
mergers, our populations of cosmologically accreted blue GCs are systematically
more spatially extended and have higher velocity dispersions than for red GCs,
in agreement with observations. For the same reason, assembly histories
including a higher fraction of minor mergers result in more spatially extended
GC populations. GC line-of-sight velocity distributions featuring negative
values of the kurtosis $\kappa$, as recently observed, are ubiquitous in our
models. Therefore, $\kappa<0$ is not at odds with an accretion scenario, and in
fact a fingerprint of the important contribution of minor mergers. However, our
populations of accreted GCs remain mostly radially biased, with profiles of the
anisotropy parameter $\beta$ that are mildly radial in the center
($\beta(r<10~{\rm kpc})\sim0.2$) and strongly radially anisotropic at large
galactocentric distances ($\beta(r>30~{\rm kpc})\gtrsim0.6$), for both red and
blue populations.

by the properties of binomial distribution and linear feedback logics; and the
Bayesian Neural Network-oriented Wallace Gaussian Random Number Generator. To

technology can potentially be utilized for developing low-complexity and
high-scalability solution frameworks for solving a large class of convex

proposed algorithm is an iterative procedure that iterates a constant number of

The CO chemical group of carbonaceous chondrites has a significant number of
these least-processed samples. We present visible/near-infrared and
mid-infrared spectra of eight least-processed CO meteorites (petrologic type
3.0-3.1). In the visible/near-infrared, these COs are characterized by a broad
weak feature that was first observed by Cloutis et al. (2012) to be at 1.3-um
and attributed to iron-rich amorphous silicate matrix materials. This feature
is observed to be centered at 1.4-um for terrestrially unweathered,
least-processed CO meteorites. At mid-infrared wavelengths, a 21-um feature,
consistent with Si-O vibrations of amorphous materials and glasses, is also
present. This spectral signature is absent in both the near- and mid-infrared
spectra of higher metamorphic grade COs because this material has
recrystallized as crystalline olivine. Furthermore, spectra of least-processed
primitive meteorites from other chemical groups (CRs, MET 00426 and QUE 99177,

integrability of the stationary probability. In such a case there is no need to
introduce boundary conditions with the purpose to eliminate infinite inflation.

often characterized by a vast number of input parameters. Performing
uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks with Monte Carlo (MC) methods is almost
always infeasible because of the need to perform hundreds of thousands or even
millions of forward model evaluations in order to obtain convergent statistics.
One, thus, tries to construct a cheap-to-evaluate surrogate model to replace
the forward model solver. For systems with large numbers of input parameters,
one has to deal with the curse of dimensionality - the exponential increase in
the volume of the input space, as the number of parameters increases linearly.
In this work, we demonstrate the use of deep neural networks (DNN) to construct
surrogate models for numerical simulators. We parameterize the structure of the
DNN in a manner that lends the DNN surrogate the interpretation of recovering a
low dimensional nonlinear manifold. The model response is a parameterized
nonlinear function of the low dimensional projections of the input. We think of
this low dimensional manifold as a nonlinear generalization of the notion of
the active subspace. Our approach is demonstrated with a problem on uncertainty
propagation in a stochastic elliptic partial differential equation (SPDE) with
uncertain diffusion coefficient. We deviate from traditional formulations of
the SPDE problem by not imposing a specific covariance structure on the random
diffusion coefficient. Instead, we attempt to solve a more challenging problem
of learning a map between an arbitrary snapshot of the diffusion field and the
response.

and coping with challenging data features like heteroskedasticity, heavy tails

suffers from catastrophic forgetting. The main reason for catastrophic
forgetting is that the past data are not available during learning. Typical
approaches keep some exemplars for the past classes and use distillation
regularization to retain the classification capability on the past classes and
balance the past and new classes. However, there are four main problems with
these approaches. First, the loss function is not efficient for classification.
Second, there is unbalance problem between the past and new classes. Third, the
size of pre-decided exemplars is usually limited and they might not be
distinguishable from unseen new classes. Forth, the exemplars may not be
allowed to be kept for a long time due to privacy regulations. To address these
problems, we propose (a) a new loss function to combine the cross-entropy loss
and distillation loss, (b) a simple way to estimate and remove the unbalance
between the old and new classes , and (c) using Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) to generate historical data and select representative exemplars during

investigate the effect in a ballistic Weyl semimetal sample having the geometry
of a slab. We discuss why in a general situation the bulk and the boundary
contributions towards the CME are comparable. We show, however, that under
certain conditions the adiabatic CME is dominated by the Fermi arc states at
the boundary. We find that despite the topologically protected nature of the
Fermi arcs, their contribution to the CME is neither related to any topological
invariant nor can generally be calculated within the bulk low-energy effective
theory framework. For certain types of boundary, however, the Fermi arcs
contribution to the CME can be found from the effective low energy Weyl
Hamiltonian and the scattering phase characterising the collision of a Weyl
excitation with the boundary.

asymmetric ring around the core centre, where CH$_3$OH is mostly in solid form,
with a clear peak 4000~au to the north-east of the dust continuum peak. As part
of the NOEMA Large Project SOLIS (Seeds of Life in Space), the CH$_3$OH peak
has been spatially resolved to study its kinematics and physical structure and
to investigate the cause behind the local enhancement. We find that methanol
emission is distributed in a ridge parallel to the main axis of the dense core.
The centroid velocity increases by about 0.2~km~s$^{-1}$ and the velocity
dispersion increases from subsonic to transonic towards the central zone of the
core, where the velocity field also shows complex structure. This could be
indication of gentle accretion of material onto the core or interaction of two
filaments, producing a slow shock. We measure the rotational temperature and
show that methanol is in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) only close to
the dust peak, where it is significantly depleted. The CH$_3$OH column density,
$N_{tot}({\rm CH_3OH})$, profile has been derived with non-LTE radiative
transfer modelling and compared with chemical models of a static core. The
measured $N_{tot}({\rm CH_3OH})$ profile is consistent with model predictions,
but the total column densities are one order of magnitude lower than those
predicted by models, suggesting that the efficiency of reactive desorption or
atomic hydrogen tunnelling adopted in the model may be overestimated; or that
an evolutionary model is needed to better reproduce methanol abundance.

general-relativistic magnetohydrondynamics (GRMHD) module for the MPI-AMRVAC

the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics in arbitrary curved spacetimes with
a significant speedup and saving in computational cost. In a previous work,
this was shown using a Generalized Lagrange Multiplier (GLM) to enforce the
solenoidal constraint of the magnetic field. While GLM is fully compatible with
MPI-AMRVAC's AMR infrastructure, we found that simulations were sensible to the
divergence control technique employed, resulting in an improved behavior for
those using Constrained Transport (CT). However, cell-centered CT is
incompatible with AMR, and several modifications were required to make AMR
compatible with staggered CT. We present here preliminary results of these new
additions, which achieved machine precision fulfillment of the solenoidal
constraint and a significant speedup in a problem close to the intended
scientific application.

The spin-orbit torque was generated by a transverse microwave current across
the magnetic waveguide. The detected spin wave signals for an in-plane
magnetization across the waveguide (Damon-Eshbach configuration) exhibited the
expected phase rotation and amplitude decay upon propagation when the current
spreading was taken into account. Wavevectors up to about 6 rad/$\mu$m could be
excited by the spin-orbit torque antennas despite the current spreading,
presumably due to the non-uniformity of the microwave current. The relative
magnitude of generated anti-damping spin-Hall and Oersted fields was calculated
within an analytic model and it was found that they contribute approximately
equally to the total effective field generated by the spin-orbit torque
antenna. Due to the ellipticity of the precession in the ultrathin waveguide

the torque was however still dominated by the Oersted field. The prospects for

many interesting phenomena occur, including variable stationary objects such as

flares, and moving objects such as asteroids and the stars themselves. Funded
by NASA, we have designed and built a sky survey system for the purpose of
finding dangerous near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). This system, the ""Asteroid
Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System"" (ATLAS), has been optimized to produce
the best survey capability per unit cost, and therefore is an efficient and
competitive system for finding potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) but also
for tracking variables and finding transients. While carrying out its NASA
mission, ATLAS now discovers more bright ($m < 19$) supernovae candidates than
any ground based survey, frequently detecting very young explosions due to its
2 day cadence. ATLAS discovered the afterglow of a gamma-ray burst independent
of the high energy trigger and has released a variable star catalogue of
5$\times10^{6}$ sources. This, the first of a series of articles describing

classification due to its automatic representation learning ability and the
end-to-end learning framework. Existing deep neural networks in multi-label
classification can be divided into two kinds: binary relevance neural network
(BRNN) and threshold dependent neural network (TDNN). However, the former needs
to train a set of isolate binary networks which ignore dependencies between
labels and have heavy computational load, while the latter needs an additional
threshold function mechanism to transform the multi-class probabilities to
multi-label outputs. In this paper, we propose a joint binary neural network
(JBNN), to address these shortcomings. In JBNN, the representation of the text
is fed to a set of logistic functions instead of a softmax function, and the
multiple binary classifications are carried out synchronously in one neural
network framework. Moreover, the relations between labels are captured via
training on a joint binary cross entropy (JBCE) loss. To better meet
multi-label emotion classification, we further proposed to incorporate the
prior label relations into the JBCE loss. The experimental results on the
benchmark dataset show that our model performs significantly better than the
state-of-the-art multi-label emotion classification methods, in both
classification performance and computational efficiency.

especially when the target contains multiple words; 2) how to utilize the
interaction between target and left/right contexts to capture the most
important words in them. In this paper, we propose an approach, called
left-center-right separated neural network with rotatory attention (LCR-Rot),

has three separated LSTMs, i.e., left, center and right LSTMs, corresponding to
three parts of a review (left context, target phrase and right context); 2) it
has a rotatory attention mechanism which models the relation between target and
left/right contexts. The target2context attention is used to capture the most
indicative sentiment words in left/right contexts. Subsequently, the
context2target attention is used to capture the most important word in the
target. This leads to a two-side representation of the target: left-aware
target and right-aware target. We compare our approach on three benchmark

functions (e.g., deep neural networks); and show that a closed-loop Nash
equilibrium (NE) can be found (or at least approximated) by solving a related
optimal control problem (OCP). This is useful since solving an OCP--which is a
single-objective problem--is usually much simpler than solving the original set
of coupled OCPs that form the game--which is a multiobjective control problem.
This is a considerable improvement over the previously standard approach for
the CL analysis of MPGs, which gives no approximate solution if no NE belongs
to the chosen parametric family, and which is practical only for simple
parametric forms. We illustrate the theoretical contributions with an example
by applying our approach to a noncooperative communications engineering game.
We then solve the game with a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that learns
policies that closely approximates an exact variational NE of the game.

investigate emergent phenomena and two-dimensional (2D) superconductivity
at/near the atomically thin limit. In particular, gate-induced interfacial
superconductivity realized by the use of an electric-double-layer transistor
(EDLT) has greatly extended the capability to electrically induce
superconductivity in oxides, nitrides and transition metal chalcogenides and
enable one to explore new physics, such as the Ising pairing mechanism.
Exploiting gate-induced superconductivity in various materials can provide us
with additional platforms to understand emergent interfacial superconductivity.
Here, we report the discovery of gate-induced 2D superconductivity in layered
1T-SnSe2, a typical member of the main-group metal dichalcogenide (MDC) family,
using an EDLT gating geometry. A superconducting transition temperature Tc
around 3.9 K was demonstrated at the EDL interface. The 2D nature of the
superconductivity therein was further confirmed based on 1) a 2D Tinkham
description of the angle-dependent upper critical field, 2) the existence of a
quantum creep state as well as a large ratio of the coherence length to the
thickness of superconductivity. Interestingly, the in-plane approaching zero
temperature was found to be 2-3 times higher than the Pauli limit, which might
be related to an electric field-modulated spin-orbit interaction. Such results
provide a new perspective to expand the material matrix available for
gate-induced 2D superconductivity and the fundamental understanding of
interfacial superconductivity.

predict the most likely locations of defects in large code bases. Most of them
focus on designing features (e.g. complexity metrics) that correlate with
potentially defective code. Those approaches however do not sufficiently
capture the syntax and different levels of semantics of source code, an
important capability for building accurate prediction models. In this paper, we
develop a novel prediction model which is capable of automatically learning
features for representing source code and using them for defect prediction. Our
prediction system is built upon the powerful deep learning, tree-structured
Long Short Term Memory network which directly matches with the Abstract Syntax

difficulties of fusion when there are noisy modalities. The LSTM with Temporal
Attention performs word level fusion at a finer fusion resolution between input

GME-LSTM(A) is able to better model the multimodal structure of speech through

in various areas of physics. In recent years it has become employed to
systematically classify the anisotropic distribution of electrons and
magnetization around atoms in solid state materials. This has been fuelled by
the discovery of several physical phenomena that exhibit unusual higher rank
multipole moments, beyond that of the conventional degrees of freedom as charge
and magnetic dipole moment. Moreover, the higher rank electric/magnetic
multipole moments have been suggested as promising order parameters in exotic
hidden order phases. While the experimental investigations of such anomalous
phases have provided encouraging observations of multipolar order, theoretical
approaches have developed at a slower pace. In particular, a materials'
specific theory has been missing. The multipole concept has furthermore been
recognized as the key quantity which characterizes the resultant configuration
of magnetic moments in a cluster of atomic moments. This cluster multipole
moment has then been introduced as macroscopic order parameter for a
noncollinear antiferromagnetic structure in crystals that can explain unusual
physical phenomena whose appearance is determined by the magnetic point group
symmetry. It is the purpose of this review to discuss the recent developments

model called ""d-wise hypergraph stochastic block model"" (d-hSBM) which
naturally extends the Stochastic Block Model from graphs to d-uniform
hypergraphs, the asymptotic minimax mismatch ratio is characterized. For
proving the achievability, we propose a two-step polynomial time algorithm that
achieves the fundamental limit. The first step of the algorithm is a hypergraph
spectral clustering method which achieves partial recovery to a certain
precision level. The second step is a local refinement method which leverages
the underlying probabilistic model along with parameter estimation from the
outcome of the first step. To characterize the asymptotic performance of the
proposed algorithm, we first derive a sufficient condition for attaining weak
consistency in the hypergraph spectral clustering step. Then, under the
guarantee of weak consistency in the first step, we upper bound the worst-case
risk attained in the local refinement step by an exponentially decaying
function of the size of the hypergraph and characterize the decaying rate. For
proving the converse, the lower bound of the minimax mismatch ratio is set by
finding a smaller parameter space which contains the most dominant error
events, inspired by the analysis in the achievability part. It turns out that
the minimax mismatch ratio decays exponentially fast to zero as the number of
nodes tends to infinity, and the rate function is a weighted combination of
several divergence terms, each of which is the Renyi divergence of order 1/2
between two Bernoulli's. The Bernoulli's involved in the characterization of
the rate function are those governing the random instantiation of hyperedges in
d-hSBM. Experimental results on synthetic data validate our theoretical finding
that the refinement step is critical in achieving the optimal statistical

modulation schemes which are designed in the time-frequency domain. Through a
series of 2D transformations, OTFS converts a doubly-dispersive channel into an
almost non-fading channel in the delay-Doppler domain. In this domain, each
symbol in a frame experiences an almost constant fade, thus achieving
significant performance gains over existing modulation schemes such as OFDM.
The sparse delay-Doppler impulse response which reflects the actual physical
geometry of the wireless channel enables efficient channel estimation,
especially in high-Doppler fading channels. This paper investigates OTFS from a
signal detection and channel estimation perspective, and proposes a Markov

algorithms to compute only the information required to serve a target demand.
In contrast, an exhaustive approach computes all information in anticipation of
it being used later. However, for a given set of demands, demand-driven methods
are believed to compute the same information that would be computed by the
corresponding exhaustive methods. We investigate the precision and
bidirectional nature of demand-driven methods and show that:
  (a) demand-driven methods can be formalized inherently as bidirectional data
flow analysis because the demands are propagated against the control flow and
the information to satisfy the demands is propagated along the control flow. We
extend the formalization of the Meet Over Paths solution to bidirectional
flows. This formalization helps us to prove the soundness and precision of our
analysis, and
  (b) since a demand-driven method computes only the required information to
meet a demand, it should be able to reduce the imprecision caused by data
abstractions and hence should be more precise than an exhaustive method. We
show that while this is indeed the case with Java, for C/C++, the precision
critically hinges on how indirect assignments are handled. We use this insight
and propose a demand-driven alias analysis that is more precise than an
exhaustive analysis for C/C++ too.
  We have chosen devirtualization as an application. Our measurements show that
our method is not only more efficient but more precise than the existing

overdamped system because viscous forces dominate over inertial effects. Apart
from their use as model systems, they receive considerable attention as
sensitive probes from which forces on molecular scales can be inferred. The
interpretation of such experiments rests on the assumption, that, even if the
particles are driven, the liquid remains in equilibrium, and all modes are
overdamped. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that this is no longer valid
when a particle is forced through a viscoelastic fluid. Even at small driving
velocities where Stokes law remains valid, we observe particle oscillations
with periods up to several tens of seconds. We attribute these to
non-equilibrium fluctuations of the fluid, which are excited by the particle's
motion. The observed oscillatory dynamics is in quantitative agreement with an
overdamped Langevin equation with negative friction-memory term and which is
equivalent to the motion of a stochastically driven underdamped oscillator.
This fundamentally new oscillatory mode will largely expand the variety of
model systems but has also considerable implications on how molecular forces
are determined by colloidal probe particles under natural viscoelastic
conditions.

regularities and has many applications in computer vision and graphics. Given
an exemplar of dynamic texture, it is a dynamic but challenging task to
generate new samples with high quality that are perceptually similar to the
input exemplar, which is known to be {\em example-based dynamic texture
synthesis (EDTS)}. Numerous approaches have been devoted to this problem, in
the past decades, but none them are able to tackle all kinds of dynamic
textures equally well. In this paper, we investigate the synthesizability of
dynamic texture samples: {\em given a dynamic texture sample, how synthesizable
it is by using EDTS, and which EDTS method is the most suitable to synthesize
it?} To this end, we propose to learn regression models to connect dynamic
texture samples with synthesizability scores, with the help of a compiled
dynamic texture dataset annotated in terms of synthesizability. More precisely,
we first define the synthesizability of DT samples and characterize them by a
set of spatiotemporal features. Based on these features and an annotated
dynamic texture dataset, we then train regression models to predict the
synthesizability scores of texture samples and learn classifiers to select the
most suitable EDTS methods. We further complete the selection, partition and
synthesizability prediction of dynamic texture samples in a hierarchical
scheme. We finally apply the learned synthesizability to detecting
synthesizable regions in videos. The experiments demonstrate that our method
can effectively learn and predict the synthesizability of DT samples.

perform equally well and it is becoming in- creasingly difficult to choose one
particular system over another. An ensemble of such systems that is able to
leverage the strengths of each individual systems can build a better and more
robust summary. Despite this, few attempts have been made in this direction. In
this paper, we describe a category of ensemble systems which use consensus
between the candidate systems to build a better meta-summary. We highlight two
major shortcomings of such systems: the inability to take into account relative
performance of individual systems and overlooking content of candidate
summaries in favour of the sentence rankings. We propose an alternate method,
content-based weighted consensus summarization, which address these concerns.
We use pseudo-relevant summaries to estimate the performance of individual
candidate systems, and then use this information to generate a better aggregate
ranking. Experiments on DUC 2003 and DUC 2004 datasets show that the proposed
system outperforms existing consensus-based techniques by a large margin.

which involves multiple treatments, and the recording practice which is biased
and erroneous. Existing methods are inadequate in capturing the dynamic
structure of care. We propose Resset, an end-to-end recurrent model that reads

that discrete medical objects are embedded into continuous vectors lying in the
same space. We formulate the problem as modeling sequences of sets, a novel
setting that have rarely, if not, been addressed. Within Resset, the bag of
diseases recorded at each clinic visit is modeled as function of sets. The same
hold for the bag of treatments. The interaction between the disease bag and the
treatment bag at a visit is modeled in several, one of which as residual of
diseases minus the treatments. Finally, the health trajectory, which is a
sequence of visits, is modeled using a recurrent neural network. We report
results on over a hundred thousand hospital visits by patients suffered from
two costly chronic diseases -- diabetes and mental health. Resset shows
promises in multiple predictive tasks such as readmission prediction,
treatments recommendation and diseases progression.

polarized quark. The model is based on string dynamics and the ${}^3P_0$
mechanism of quark pair creation at string breaking. The fragmentation is
treated as a recursive process, where the splitting function of the subprocess
$q \to h + q'$ depends on the spin density matrix of the quark $q$. The
${}^3P_0$ mechanism is parametrized by a complex mass parameter $\mu$, the
imaginary part of which is responsible for single spin asymmetries. The model
has been implemented in a Monte Carlo program to simulate jets made of
pseudoscalar mesons. Results for single hadron and hadron pair transverse-spin
asymmetries are found to be in agreement with experimental data from SIDIS and
$e^+e^-$ annihilation. The model predictions on the jet-handedness are also
discussed.

optimized by maximizing signal-difference-to-noise ratio squared (SDNR2) in an
optimally weighted image and signal-to-noise ratio squared (SNR2) in a
gadolinium basis image in a silicon-strip detector and a cadmium zinc telluride

don't always increase with increasing attenuation if pileup is included.
Optimizing the thresholds for a 30 cm phantom yields near-optimal SDNR2 or SNR2

This secular growth of error is sometimes attributed to the increase in entropy
of the system even though Newton's equations of motion are strictly time
reversible. We demonstrate that when numerical errors are reduced to below the
physical perturbation and its exponential growth during integration the
microscopic reversibility is retrieved. Time reversibility itself is not a

time reversible algorithms may be used to find initial conditions for which
perturbed trajectories converge rather than diverge. The ability to calculate
such a converging pair of solutions is a striking illustration which shows that
it is possible to compute a definitive solution to a highly unstable problem.
This works as follows: If you (i) use a code which is capable of producing a
definitive solution (and which will therefore handle converging pairs of
solutions correctly), (ii) use it to study the statistical result of some other
problem, and then (iii) find that some other code produces a solution S with
statistical properties which are indistinguishable from those of the definitive

limited to urban areas, while a large portion of the world's population still
lives outside cities and rural areas dominate land use worldwide. Here, we
extend the concept of SAMs to population density scale-adjusted metrics (DSAMs)

Our approach allows all human environments to be considered, avoids problems in

large-scale galactic environment following the non-equilibrium formation of
H$_2$ and CO including (self-) shielding and important heating and cooling
processes. The MCs inherit their initial level of turbulence from the diffuse
ISM, where turbulence is injected by SN explosions. However, by systematically
exploring the effect of individual SNe going off outside the clouds, we show
that at later stages the importance of SN driven turbulence is decreased
significantly. This holds for different MC masses as well as MCs with and
without magnetic fields. The SN impact also decreases rapidly with larger
distances. Nearby SNe ($d$ $\sim$ 25 pc) boost the turbulent velocity
dispersions of the MC by up to 70 per cent (up to a few km s$^{-1}$). For $d$
$>$ 50 pc, however, their impact decreases fast with increasing $d$ and is
almost negligible. For all probed distances the gain in velocity dispersion
decays rapidly within a few 100 kyr. This is significantly shorter than the
average timescale for a MC to be hit by a nearby SN under solar neighbourhood
conditions ($\sim$ 2 Myr). Hence, at these conditions SNe are not able to
sustain the observed level of MC turbulence. However, in environments with high

(vdW) effect, a small but ubiquitous many-body attraction that presents
challenges to density functional theory. How does the binding energy depend
upon the size or number of atoms in one of a pair of identical nanostructures?
To answer this question, we treat each nanostructure properly as a whole
object, not as a collection of atoms. Our calculations start from an accurate
static dipole polarizability for each considered nanostructure, and an accurate
equilibrium center-to-center distance for the pair (the latter from experiment,
or from the vdW-DF-cx functional). We consider the competition in each term
$-C_{2k}/d^{2k}$ ($k=3, 4, 5$) of the long-range vdW series for the interaction
energy, between the size dependence of the vdW coefficient $C_{2k}$ and that of
the $2k$-th power of the center-to-center distance $d$. The damping of these
vdW terms can be negligible, but in any case it does not affect the size
dependence for a given term in the absence of non-vdW binding. To our surprise,
the vdW energy can be size-independent for quasi-spherical nanoclusters bound
to one another by vdW interaction, even with strong nonadditivity of the vdW
coefficient, as demonstrated for fullerenes. We also show that, for
low-dimensional systems, the vdW interaction yields the strongest
size-dependence, in stark contrast to that of fullerenes. We illustrate this
with parallel planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Other cases are between,

  In this paper we prove that the variety of distributive lattices is not an
exception, but an instance of a more general phenomenon. We show that for
almost all nontrivial locally finite varieties of lattices no ""reasonable""
expansion of the finite members of the variety by linear orders gives rise to a
Ramsey class. The responsibility for this lies not with the lattices as
structures, but with the lack of algebraic morphisms: if we consider lattices
as partially ordered sets (and thus switch from algebraic embeddings to
embeddings of relational structures) we show that every variety of lattices
gives rise to a class of linearly ordered posets having both the Ramsey
property and the ordering property. It now comes as no surprise that the same
is true for varieties of semilattices.

modalities from a given query of one modality. The main challenge is to map
different modalities into a common semantic space, in which distance between
concepts in different modalities can be well modeled. For cross-modal
information retrieval between images and texts, existing work mostly uses
off-the-shelf Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image feature extraction.
For texts, word-level features such as bag-of-words or word2vec are employed to
build deep learning models to represent texts. Besides word-level semantics,
the semantic relations between words are also informative but less explored. In
this paper, we model texts by graphs using similarity measure based on
word2vec. A dual-path neural network model is proposed for couple feature
learning in cross-modal information retrieval. One path utilizes Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) for text modeling based on graph representations.
The other path uses a neural network with layers of nonlinearities for image
modeling based on off-the-shelf features. The model is trained by a pairwise
similarity loss function to maximize the similarity of relevant text-image
pairs and minimize the similarity of irrelevant pairs. Experimental results
show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
significantly, with 17% improvement on accuracy for the best case.

The perpendicular turbulent mixing, as the fundamental dynamics of MHD

perpendicular neutral-ion decoupling scale in partially ionized media.
Differently, dense perpendicular filaments arise in highly supersonic

Several recent studies have proposed methods to stabilize connection weights of

method. The Flatland $H$-function is derived and benchmark values and some
identities unique to Flatland are presented. A number of the derivations are
supported by Monte Carlo simulation.

embedded within InP photonic nanowire waveguides emitting at telecom
wavelengths. We demonstrate a dramatic dependence of the emission rate on both
the emission wavelength and the nanowire diameter. With an appropriately
designed waveguide, tailored to the emission wavelength of the dot, an increase
in count rate by nearly two orders of magnitude (0.4kcps to 35kcps) is obtained
for quantum dots emitting in the telecom O-band. Using
emission-wavelength-optimised waveguides, we demonstrate bright, narrow
linewidth emission from single InAsP quantum dots with an unprecedented tuning
range from 880nm to 1550nm. These results pave the way towards efficient single
photon sources at telecom wavelengths using deterministically grown InAsP/InP
nanowire quantum dots.

poloidal cross-section of a fusion device, based on line-integrated
measurements along several lines of sight. The reconstruction process is
computationally intensive and, in practice, only a few reconstructions are
usually computed per pulse. In this work, we trained a deep neural network
based on a large collection of sample tomograms that have been produced at JET
over several years. Once trained, the network is able to reproduce those
results with high accuracy. More importantly, it can compute all the
tomographic reconstructions for a given pulse in just a few seconds. This makes
it possible to visualize several phenomena -- such as plasma heating,
disruptions and impurity transport -- over the course of a discharge.

GRACE is one of the important requirement. It is required not only for the
mission performance but also for the good quality of the gravity field models
which are estimated from the inter-satellite ranging measurements. Here we
present a comparative study of the analysis of two attitude datasets. One of
them is the standardSCA1Brelease 2 datasets provided by JPL NASA and another is
the reprocessed attitude computed atTU Graz by combining the angular
accelerations and the standardSCA1Brelease2 datasets. Further, we also present
the impact of the attitude datasets on the inter-satellite range measurements
by analyzing their residuals. Our analysis reveals the significant improvement
in the attitude due to the reprocessed product and reduced value of residuals
computed from the reprocessed attitude.

equations known as Information Field Dynamics (IFD). Information field dynamics
attempts to improve on existing simulation schemes by incorporating Bayesian
field inference into the simulation scheme. The field inference is truly
Bayesian and thus depends on a notion of prior belief. A number of results are
presented, both theoretical and practical. Many small fixes and results on the
general theory are presented, before exploring two general classes of
simulation schemes that are possible in the IFD framework. For both, we present
a set of theoretical results alongside the development of a prototype scheme.
The first class of models corresponds roughly to traditional fixed-grid
numerical PDE solvers. The prior Bayesian assumption in these models is that
the fields are smooth, and their correlation structure does not vary between
locations. For these reasons we call them translation-invariant schemes. We
show the requirements for stability of these schemes, but most importantly we
prove that these schemes indeed converge to the true behaviour of the field in
the limit of high resolutions. Convergence had never been shown for any
previous IFD scheme. We also find the error scaling of these codes and show
that they implement something very analogous to a high-order finite-difference
derivative approximation, which are the most elementary and well-studied
numerical schemes. This is an important result, which proves the validity of
the IFD approach. The second class of schemes, called the SPH-like schemes are
similar to existing Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics codes, in which the
simulation grid moves with the flow of the field being modelled.
