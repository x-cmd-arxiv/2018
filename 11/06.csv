classical Einstein and matter-field equations. This localized finite-energy
static classical solution can be interpreted as a single spacetime defect
embedded in Minkowski spacetime and may give rise to several new effects. For a
Skyrme-type theory with small enough matter-field energy scale compared to the
Planck energy scale and for a sufficiently small defect length scale, the
existence of a globally regular solution requires a negative active
gravitational mass, so that the defect repels a distant test particle
(""antigravity""). There also exist ""stealth defects"" which have a vanishing
asymptotic gravitational mass. These stealth defects are, however, not entirely
invisible as they bring about a new type of gravitational lensing.

of fundamental importance in physics, with applications ranging from solid
state physics to optics. In optics, Pancharatnam-Berry phase allows the
tailoring of optical beams by a local control of their polarization. Here we
discuss light propagation in the presence of an intensity-dependent local
modulation of the Pancharatnam-Berry phase. The corresponding self-modulation
of the wavefront counteracts the natural spreading due to diffraction, i.e.,
self-focusing takes place. No refractive index variation is associated with the
self-focusing: the confinement is uniquely due to a nonlinear spin-orbit
interaction. The phenomenon is investigated, both theoretically and
experimentally, considering the reorientational nonlinearity in liquid
crystals, where light is able to rotate the local optical axis through an
intensity-dependent optical torque. Our discoveries pave the way to the
investigation of a new family of nonlinear waves featuring a strong interaction
between the spin and the orbital degrees of freedom.

of detecting which device has been used to capture a video. This enables to
trace down the owner of a video sequence, which proves extremely helpful to
solve copyright infringement cases as well as to fight distribution of illicit
material (e.g., underage clips, terroristic threats, etc.). Currently, the most
promising methods to tackle this task exploit unique noise traces left by
camera sensors on acquired images. However, given the recent advancements in
motion stabilization of video content, robustness of sensor pattern noise-based
techniques are strongly hindered. Indeed, video stabilization introduces
geometric transformations between video frames, thus making camera fingerprint
estimation problematic with classical approaches. In this paper, we deal with
the challenging problem of attributing stabilized videos to their recording
device. Specifically, we propose: (i) a strategy to extract the characteristic
fingerprint of a device, starting from either a set of images or stabilized
video sequences; (ii) a strategy to match a stabilized video sequence with a
given fingerprint in order to solve the device attribution problem. The
proposed methodology is tested on videos coming from a set of different
smartphones, taken from the modern publicly available Vision Dataset. The
conducted experiments also provide an interesting insight on the effect of
modern smartphones video stabilization algorithms on specific video frames.

catalogue of 2716 radio AGN. For these AGN, we investigate the impact of galaxy
density on 1.4 GHz radio luminosity ($L_{1.4}$). We determine their close
environment densities using the surface density parameter, $\Sigma_N,$ for
$N=2$ and $N=5,$ which we bin by redshift to obtain a pseudo-3D galaxy density
measure. Matching the radio AGN to sources without radio detections in terms of
redshift, $K-$band magnitude and ($g-K$)-colour index, we obtain samples of
control galaxies and determine whether radio AGN environments differ from this
general population. Our results indicate that the environmental density of
radio AGN and their radio luminosity are not correlated up to $z$ $\sim0.8$,
over the luminosity range $10^{23} < (L_{1.4} / $W~Hz$^{-1}) < 10^{26}$. We
also find that, when using a control sample matched in terms of redshift,
$K-$band magnitude and colour, environments of radio AGN are similar to those
of the control sample but with an excess of overdense regions in which radio
AGN are more prevalent. Our results suggest that the $<1$ Mpc-scale galaxy
environment plays some role in determining whether a galaxy produces a radio
AGN. The jet power, however, does not correlate with environment. From this, we
infer that secular processes e.g. accretion flows of cold gas to the central
black-hole are more critical in fuelling radio AGN activity than radio jet
power.

$6\arcmin$ of the centers of MaDCoWS galaxy clusters, we find a distinct
overdensity of AGN within $1\arcmin$ of the galaxy cluster center for AGN of
all selection methods. The fraction of red galaxies that host AGN as a function
of clustercentric distance is, however, dependent on the AGN selection. The
fraction of red galaxies in cluster environments that host AGN selected by
optical signatures or blue OIR color is at a deficit compared to the field,
while MIR-selected and red OIR color AGN are enhanced in the centers of
clusters when compared to field levels. The radio-selected AGN fraction is more

conducive to the triggering of radio emission in AGN. We do not find a
statistically significant change in the AGN fraction as a function of cluster
richness. We also investigate the correlation of central radio activity with
other AGN in galaxy clusters. Clusters with radio activity have more central
AGN than radio-inactive clusters, implying that central cluster radio activity

Although techniques exist for verifying input/output properties of the neural
network itself, these methods cannot be used to verify properties of the
closed-loop system (since they work with piecewise-linear constraints that do
not capture non-linear plant dynamics). To overcome this challenge, we focus on
sigmoid-based networks and exploit the fact that the sigmoid is the solution to
a quadratic differential equation, which allows us to transform the neural
network into an equivalent hybrid system. By composing the network's hybrid
system with the plant's, we transform the problem into a hybrid system
verification problem which can be solved using state-of-the-art reachability
tools. We show that reachability is decidable for networks with one hidden
layer and decidable for general networks if Schanuel's conjecture is true. We
evaluate the applicability and scalability of Verisig in two case studies, one
from reinforcement learning and one in which the neural network is used to
approximate a model predictive controller.

planning is to optimize the beam angles in a reasonable computation time. To
demonstrate the value of prior knowledge on improving the efficiency of beam
angle optimization (BAO) in IMRT, this study proposes a modified genetic
algorithm (GA) by incorporating prior knowledge into the evolutionary
procedure. In the so-called nowGABAO (kNOWledge guided GA for BAO) approach,
two types of prior knowledge are incorporated into the general flowchart of GA:
(1) beam angle constraints, which define the angle scopes through which no beam
is allowed to pass, and (2) plan templates, which define the most possible beam
configurations suitable to the studied case and are used to guide the
evolutionary progress of GA. Optimization tasks with different prior knowledge
were tested, and the results on two complicated clinical cases at the
head-and-neck and lung regions show that suitable defining of angle constraints
and plan templates may obviously speedup the optimization. Furthermore, a
moderate number of quite bad templates produce negligible influence on the
degradation of optimization efficiency. In conclusion, prior knowledge helps
improve the beam angle optimization efficiency, and can be suitably
incorporated by a GA. It is resistant to the inclusion of bad templates.

learning are supported by replacing missing observations with samples from
learned priors. We demonstrate TzK by training jointly on MNIST and Omniglot

black hole for powering synchrotron emission and ultra high-energy cosmic rays.
The ""inner engine"" is identified in the proper use of a classical solution
introduced by Wald in 1974 duly extended to the most extreme conditions found
around the newborn black hole in a BdHN. The energy extraction process occurs
in a sequence impulsive processes each accelerating protons to $10^{21}$ eV in
a timescale of $10^{-6}$ s and in presence of an external magnetic field of
$10^{14}$ G. Specific example is given for a black hole of initial angular

time-dependent layer potentials. One is the quadratic cost of history
dependence, which has been successfully addressed by splitting the potentials
into two parts - a local part that contains the most recent contributions and a
history part that contains the contributions from all earlier times. The
history part is smooth, easily discretized using high-order quadratures, and
straightforward to compute using a variety of fast algorithms. The local part,
however, involves complicated singularities in the underlying Green's function.
Existing methods, based on exchanging the order of integration in space and
time, are able to achieve high order accuracy, but are limited to the case of
stationary boundaries. Here, we present a new quadrature method that leaves the
order of integration unchanged, making use of a change of variables that
converts the singular integrals with respect to time into smooth ones. We have
also derived asymptotic formulas for the local part that lead to fast and
accurate hybrid schemes, extending earlier work for scalar heat potentials and
applicable to moving boundaries. The performance of the overall scheme is
demonstrated via numerical examples.

There is a large collection of methods developed for STLF, but selecting a
suitable method under varying conditions is still challenging. This paper
develops a novel reinforcement learning based dynamic model selection (DMS)
method for STLF. A forecasting model pool is first built, including ten
state-of-the-art machine learning based forecasting models. Then a Q-learning
agent learns the optimal policy of selecting the best forecasting model for the
next time step, based on the model performance. The optimal DMS policy is
applied to select the best model at each time step with a moving window.
Numerical simulations on two-year load and weather data show that the
Q-learning algorithm converges fast, resulting in effective and efficient DMS.
The developed STLF model with Q-learning based DMS improves the forecasting
accuracy by approximately 50%, compared to the state-of-the-art machine
learning based STLF models.

a topological insulator. In bulk form, the ferromagnetic phase of Bi2MnSe4 is
either a nodal line or Weyl semimetal, depending on the direction of the spins.
When the spins are arranged in a layered antiferromagnetic configuration, the
combination of time reversal plus a partial translation is a new symmetry, and
the material instead becomes an antiferromagnetic topological insulator.
However, the intrinsic TRS breaking at the surface of Bi2MnSe4 removes the
typical Dirac cone feature, allowing the observation of the half-integer
quantum anomalous Hall effect (AHC). Furthermore, we show that in thin film
form, for some thicknesses, Bi2MnSe4 becomes a Chern insulator with a band gap
of up to 58 meV. This combination of properties in a stoichiometric magnetic

that these claimed finite-time singularities are not genuine. Over the whole

functions. We show that the existence of the potential for unique velocity is
necessary but insufficient, as the velocity fields are merely specified up to
multiples of the curl of a vector potential, which satisfies a system of
degenerated Laplace's equations. We have derived several closed-form formulas

follows that steady solutions of Euler's equations are indeterminate. Hence,
use of singular potential flow in expounding fluid motions is inept. The

non-unique flow fields. In essence, the notion of a finite-time singularity is

chirality usually coexists with the non-chiral force and the chiral force
usually takes a very small portion of the total force. In this work, we
investigate a case where the optical force exerted on an object is purely due
to the chirality while there is zero force on non-chiral object. We find that a
trapping force arises on chiral particles when it is placed in a field
consisted of two orthogonally polarized counter-propagating plane waves. We
have revealed the underlying physics of this force by modeling the particle as
a chiral diploe and analytically study the optical force. We find besides
chirality; the trapping force is also closely related to the dual
electric-magnetic symmetry of field and dual asymmetry of material. We also
demonstrate that the proposed idea is not restricted to dipolar chiral objects
only. Chiral Mie objects can also be trapped based on the technique proposed in
this article. Notably, such chiral trapping forces have been found robust by
varying several parameters throughout the investigation. This trapping force
may find applications in identifying object's chirality and the selective
trapping of chiral objects.

stand out. Two nuclear blobs, one composed by young stars (t $\leq$ 50Myr) and
one with intermediate-age stars (50Myr $<$ t $\leq$ 2Gyr) both shifted from the
centre. The third one is an internal intermediate-age spiral arm-like
structure, surrounding the blob of young stars. Our results indicate star
formation has occurred through multiple bursts in this source. Furthermore, the
youngest stellar populations (t $\lesssim$ 2Gyr) are distributed along a
circumnuclear star-forming ring with r$\sim$250pc. The ring displays star
formation rates (SFRs) in the range of 0.002-0.14M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, favoring
the `pearls-on-a-string' scenario. The old underlying bulge stellar population
component (t $>$ 2Gyr) is distributed outside the two blob structures. For the
nuclear region (inner $\sim$60pc radius) we derived a SFR of

reveal a rather complex star formation history in NGC4303, with different

phonon magnon drag model that we have used in our publication, in fact cannot
explain the original work of Uchida et al. (2) The commenters based their
critique on an estimate of the magnitude of the measured effect, arguing that
to observe the TSSE that we originally claimed, the temperature gradient in our
measurements should have been much larger than the value we measured. In this
Reply, firstly, we summarize previous literature reports on the TSSE response
in FM metallic systems. Secondly, we dispute the estimate of the necessary
large temperature gradient made by the commenters. Importantly, the Kerr effect
sensitivity to spin accumulation (via the TSSE response) has not been
recognized by the commenters, in fact it was mistakenly assumed that the Kerr
effect sensitivity to the spin accumulation by the TSSE is the same as the Kerr
sensitivity to the bulk magnetization change due to the temperature change. In
conclusion, we show that the TSSE is the only viable interpretation of our
original measurements, and that the phonon-magnon drag model is indeed capable

the label of an example $x \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ is given by $\mathbf{U}^*

samples as a matrix $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$ and the (possibly
noisy) labels $\mathbf{U}^* f(\mathbf{V}^* \mathbf{X}) + \mathbf{E}$ of the

recover the weight matrices $\mathbf{U}^*$ and $\mathbf{V}^*$.
  In this work, we develop algorithms and hardness results under varying
assumptions on the input and noise. Although the problem is NP-hard even for
$k=2$, by assuming Gaussian marginals over the input $\mathbf{X}$ we are able
to develop polynomial time algorithms for the approximate recovery of
$\mathbf{U}^*$ and $\mathbf{V}^*$. Perhaps surprisingly, in the noiseless case
our algorithms recover $\mathbf{U}^*,\mathbf{V}^*$ exactly, i.e., with no
error. To the best of the our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to
accomplish exact recovery. For the noisy case, we give the first polynomial
time algorithm that approximately recovers the weights in the presence of
mean-zero noise $\mathbf{E}$. Our algorithms generalize to a larger class of

of the impact of interference, we assume that a given packet is successfully

interference treatment. Using our model, we study the scaling of the packet
reception probabilities per link budget as a function of the spatial density of

In this context, we investigated the barocaloric effects in Nitrile Butadiene
Rubber (NBR) in a large range around room temperature. Moderated applied
pressures on NBR yield giant temperature change ({\Delta}TS) and entropy change
({\Delta}ST), reaching the maximum values of 16.4(2) K at 323 K and 59(6) J

region and apply it to the case of halide ions (X$^-$, X = F-At) in water. This
approach is based on electronic structure calculations combining the
relativistic equation of motion coupled-cluster method for electron detachment
(EOM-IP-CCSD) and density functional theory via the frozen density embedding
(FDE) approach, using structures from classical molecular dynamics with
polarizable force fields for discrete systems (in the present study, droplets
containing the anion and 50 water molecules). Our results indicate one can
accurately capture both the large solvent effect observed for the halides as
well as the splitting of their ionization signals due to the increasingly large
spin-orbit coupling of the p$_{3/2}$-p$_{1/2}$ manifold across the series, at
an affordable computational cost. Furthermore, due to the quantum mechanical
treatment of both solute and solvent, electron binding energies of
semi-quantitative quality are also obtained also obtained for (bulk) water as
by-products of the calculations for the halogens (in droplets).

describe and motivate our choice of run configurations with an optimal filling

fields of $10~\mu$T and $20~\mu$T. The choice of these run configurations

improves the sensitivity to test the signals. We also elaborate on the

investigated, including weight pruning, weight clustering and quantization,

while weight clustering/quantization leverages the redundancy in the number of
bit representations of weights. They can be effectively combined in order to
exploit the maximum degree of redundancy. However, there lacks a systematic
investigation in literature towards this direction.
  In this paper, we fill this void and develop a unified, systematic framework
of DNN weight pruning and clustering/quantization using Alternating Direction
Method of Multipliers (ADMM), a powerful technique in optimization theory to
deal with non-convex optimization problems. Both DNN weight pruning and
clustering/quantization, as well as their combinations, can be solved in a
unified manner. For further performance improvement in this framework, we adopt
multiple techniques including iterative weight quantization and retraining,
joint weight clustering training and centroid updating, weight clustering
retraining, etc. The proposed framework achieves significant improvements both
in individual weight pruning and clustering/quantization problems, as well as
their combinations. For weight pruning alone, we achieve 167x weight reduction
in LeNet-5, 24.7x in AlexNet, and 23.4x in VGGNet, without any accuracy loss.
For the combination of DNN weight pruning and clustering/quantization, we
achieve 1,910x and 210x storage reduction of weight data on LeNet-5 and
AlexNet, respectively, without accuracy loss. Our codes and models are released

communication with the FC. For energy efficiency, a sensor transmits only if
the sensor test statistic exceeds a local threshold {\theta}k, its channel gain
exceeds a minimum threshold, and its battery state can afford the transmission.
Our proposed transmission model at each sensor is motivated by the channel
inversion power control strategy in the wireless communication community.
Considering a constraint on the average energy of transmit symbols, we study
the optimal {\theta}_k's that optimize two detection performance metrics: (i)
the detection probability P_D at the FC, assuming that the FC utilizes the
optimal fusion rule based on Neyman-Pearson optimality criterion, and (ii)
Kullback-Leibler distance (KL) between the two distributions of the received
signals at the FC conditioned by each hypothesis. Our numerical results
indicate that {\theta}k's obtained from maximizing the KL distance are
near-optimal. Finding these thresholds is computationally efficient, as it
requires only K one-dimensional searches, as opposed to a K-dimensional search
required to find the thresholds that maximize P_D.

essential for phospholipid membranes, since it determines their function and
their interaction with other molecules. Here we consider water confined in
stacked membranes with hydration from poor to complete, as observed in a number
of biological systems. Experiments show that the dynamics of water slows down
dramatically when the hydration level is reduced. All-atom molecular dynamics
simulations identify three (inner, hydration and outer) regions, within a
distance of approximately 1 nm from the membrane, where water molecules exhibit
different degrees of slowing down in the dynamics. The slow-down is a
consequence of the robustness of the hydrogen bonds between water and lipids
and the long lifetime of the hydrogen bonds between water molecules near the
membrane. The interaction with the interface, therefore, induces a structural
change in the water that can be emphasized by calculating its intermediate
range order. Surprisingly, at distances as far as ~ 2.5 nm from the interface,
although the bulk-like dynamics is recovered, the intermediate range order of
water is still slightly higher than that in the bulk at the same thermodynamic
conditions. Therefore, the water-membrane interface has a structural effect at
ambient conditions that propagates further than the often-invoked 1 nm length
scale. Membrane fluctuations smear out this effect macroscopically, but an
analysis performed by considering local distances and instantaneous
configurations is able to reveal it, possibly contributing to our understanding
of the role of water at biomembrane interfaces.

PRA (2008). While these two protocols are frequently conflated or presumed
equivalent, we prove that they produce distinct exponential fidelity decays
leading to differences of up to a factor of 3 in the estimated error rates
under experimentally realistic conditions. These differences arise because the
NIST RB protocol does not satisfy the unitary two-design condition for the
twirl in the Clifford-group protocol and thus the decay rate depends on
non-invariant features of the error model. Our analysis provides an important
first step towards developing definitive standards for benchmarking quantum
gates and a more rigorous theoretical underpinning for the NIST protocol and
other RB protocols lacking a group-structure. We conclude by discussing the
potential impact of these differences for estimating fault-tolerant overheads.

Critical states close to the transition have a structure compatible with

together to form larger clusters. The critical point therefore features
subthermal entanglement and a power-law distributed cluster size, while the

more resolution into the CGM and intentionally lowers resolution in the dense
ISM. We run two cosmological simulations of the same galaxy halo, once with a
simple 'no feedback' model, and separately with a more comprehensive physical
model including galactic-scale outflows as in the Illustris simulation. Our
chosen halo has a total mass of ~10^12 Msun at z ~ 2, and we achieve a median
gas mass (spatial) resolution of ~2,200 solar masses (~95 parsecs) in the CGM,
six-hundred (fourteen) times better than in the Illustris-1 simulation, a
higher spatial resolution than any cosmological simulation at this mass scale
to date. We explore the primary channel(s) of cold-phase CGM gas production in
this regime. We find that winds substantially enhance the amount of cold gas in
the halo, also evidenced in the covering fractions of HI and the equivalent
widths of MgII out to large radii, in better agreement with observations than
the case without galactic winds. Using a tracer particle analysis to follow the
thermodynamic history of gas, we demonstrate how the majority of this cold,
dense gas arises due to rapid cooling of the wind material interacting with the
hot halo, and how large amounts of cold, ~10^4 K gas can be produced and
persist in galactic halos with Tvir ~ 10^6 K. At the resolutions presently
considered, the quantitative properties of the CGM we explore are not
appreciably affected by the refinement scheme.

describe potentially critical details arising from the nonlinearities of the

self-consistently following the combined evolution of particle distributions

demonstrate that the early growth of instability conforms to the predictions

highly anisotropic CR distributions do not efficiently reduce to Alfvenic drift

derive estimates for the wave amplitudes at saturation and the time scales for

inconsistencies when coupled to gravity. However, this scenario was not
completely ruled out by previous arguments. In this paper, we show that in a
theory where the low energy dynamics of the gravitons are governed by the
Einstein-Hilbert action, any finite number of massive elementary particles with
spin more than two cannot interact with gravitons, even classically, in a way
that preserves causality. This is achieved in flat spacetime by studying
eikonal scattering of higher spin particles in more than three spacetime
dimensions. Our argument is insensitive to the physics above the effective
cut-off scale and closes certain loopholes in previous arguments. Furthermore,
it applies to higher spin particles even if they do not contribute to
tree-level graviton scattering as a consequence of being charged under a global
symmetry such as $\mathbb{Z}_2$. We derive analogous bounds in anti-de Sitter
spacetime from analyticity properties of correlators of the dual CFT in the
Regge limit. We also argue that an infinite tower of fine-tuned higher spin
particles can still be consistent with causality. However, they necessarily
affect the dynamics of gravitons at an energy scale comparable to the mass of
the lightest higher spin particle. Finally, we apply the bound in de Sitter to
impose restrictions on the structure of three-point functions in the squeezed

the intermediate and major axes than along the minor axis, indicating that the
morphology of simulated galaxies is influenced significantly by the structure
of their velocity dispersion. The simulations reveal that this anisotropy
correlates with the intrinsic morphology of the galaxy's inner dark matter
halo, i.e. the halo's morphology that emerges in the absence of dissipative
baryonic physics. This implies the existence of a causal relationship between
the morphologies of galaxies and that of their host dark matter haloes.

specific SFR decreases, the central stellar mass, the fraction of disk galaxies
hosting stellar bars, and active galactic nuclei (AGNs; including both LINERs

luminosity, such that luminous galaxies typically have large sizes. The recent
identification of a significant population of galaxies with large sizes but low
luminosities (""ultra diffuse galaxies"", or UDGs) raises the question whether
the inverse is also true, that is, whether large galaxies typically have high
luminosities. Here we address this question by studying a size-limited sample
of galaxies in the Coma cluster. We select red cluster galaxies with sizes
$r_{\mathrm{eff}} > 2 \ \mathrm{kpc}$ down to $M_{g} \sim -13 \ \mathrm{mag}$
in an area of $9 \ \mathrm{deg}^2$, using carefully-filtered CFHT images. The
sample is complete to a central surface brightness of $\mu_{g,0}\approx 25.0 \
\mathrm{mag\,arcsec}^{-2}$ and includes 90% of Dragonfly-discovered UDGs
brighter than this limit. Unexpectedly, we find that red, large galaxies have a
fairly uniform distribution in the size-luminosity plane: there is no peak at
the absolute magnitude implied by the canonical size-luminosity relation. The
number of galaxies within $\pm 0.5$ magnitudes of the canonical peak ($M_g =
-19.69$ for $2<r_{\mathrm{eff}}<3$ kpc) is a factor of $\sim 9$ smaller than
the number of fainter galaxies with $-19<M_g<-13$. Large, faint galaxies such
as UDGs are far more common than large galaxies that are on the size-luminosity
relation. An implication is that, for large galaxies, size is not an indicator
of halo mass. Finally, we show that the structure of faint large galaxies is
different from that of bright large galaxies: at fixed large size, the S\'ersic
index decreases with magnitude following the relation $\log_{10} n \approx
-0.067M_g-0.989$.

publications from the Subaru High-$z$ Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars
(SHELLQs) project, which exploits the deep multi-band imaging data produced by
the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program survey. The LF was
calculated with a complete sample of 110 quasars at $5.7 \le z \le 6.5$, which
includes 48 SHELLQs quasars discovered over 650 deg$^2$, and 63 brighter

$z \sim 6$ quasars with a well-defined selection function constructed to date,
and has allowed us to detect significant flattening of the LF at its faint end.
A double power-law function fit to the sample yields a faint-end slope $\alpha

this best-fit model over the range $-18 < M_{1450} < -30$ mag, quasars emit
ionizing photons at the rate of $\dot{n}_{\rm ion} = 10^{48.8 \pm 0.1}$

necessary to keep the intergalactic medium ionized, which indicates that

over the last 20 years, this discovery has been extended to many other metals
and to the hot atmospheres of many other galaxy clusters, groups, and giant
elliptical galaxies, as evidence that the elemental bricks of life -
synthesized by stars and supernovae - are also found at the largest scales of
the Universe. Because the ICM, emitting in X-rays, is in collisional ionisation

These abundance measurements, in turn, are valuable to constrain the physics

exploded and enriched the ICM over the entire cluster volume. On the other

enhance the contrast of optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) on NV

the merger-driven growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, such
mergers are difficult to identify observationally due to the correspondingly
small angular scales. In Paper I we presented a method of finding candidate
kpc-scale galaxy mergers that is leveraged on the selection of X-ray sources
spatially offset from the centers of host galaxies. In this paper we analyze
new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3 imaging for six of these sources to
search for signatures of galaxy mergers. The HST imaging reveals that four of
the six systems are on-going galaxy mergers with separations of 1.2-6.6 kpc
(offset AGN). The nature of the remaining two spatially offset X-ray sources is
ambiguous and may be associated with super-Eddington accretion in X-ray
binaries. The ability of this sample to probe small galaxy separations and
minor mergers makes it uniquely suited for testing the role of galaxy mergers
for AGN triggering. We find that galaxy mergers with only one AGN are
predominantly minor mergers with mass ratios similar to the overall population
of galaxy mergers. By comparison, galaxy mergers with two AGN are biased toward
major mergers and larger nuclear gas masses. Finally, we find that the level of
SMBH accretion increases toward smaller mass ratios (major mergers). This
result suggests the mass ratio effects not only the frequency of AGN triggering
but also the rate of SMBH growth in mergers.

of carbon and s-process elements from a binary AGB companion. We have performed
radial velocity monitoring of a sample of 22 CEMP-no stars to further study the

stars based on their radial velocity variations, thereby significantly
enlarging the population of known binaries to a total of eleven. One of the new
binary systems is HE 0107-5240, one of the most iron-poor stars known,
supporting the binary transfer model for the origin of the abundance pattern of
this star. In our sample we find a difference in binary fraction depending on
the absolute carbon abundance, with a binary fraction of $47^{\,+15\,}_{\,-14}
\%$ for stars with higher absolute carbon abundance and $18^{\,+14\,}_{\,\,-9}
\%$ for stars with lower absolute carbon abundance. This potentially implies a
relation between a high carbon abundance and the binarity of a metal-poor star.
Although binarity does not equate to mass transfer, there is a possibility that
a CEMP-no star in a binary system has been polluted and care has to be taken in
the interpretation of their abundance patterns. We furthermore demonstrate the

growing interest e.g. within the people involved in global analysis of proton
and nuclear parton distribution functions, saturation physics, and physics of
cosmic rays. In particular, the D- and B-meson measurements of LHCb at forward
direction are sensitive to gluon dynamics at small $x$ and are one of the few
perturbative small-$x$ probes before the next generation
deep-inelastic-scattering experiments. In this talk, we will concentrate on the
collinear-factorization approach to inclusive D-meson production and describe a
novel implementation - SACOT-$m_{\rm T}$ - of the general-mass variable flavour
number scheme (GM-VFNS). In the GM-VFNS framework the cross sections retain the
full heavy-quark mass dependence at $p_{\rm T}=0$, but gradually reduce to the
ordinary zero-mass results towards asymptotically high $p_{\rm T}$. However,
the region of small (but non-zero) $p_{\rm T}$ has been somewhat problematic in
the previous implementations of GM-VFNS, leading to divergent cross sections
towards $p_{\rm T} \rightarrow 0$, unless the QCD scales are set in a
particular way. Here, we provide a solution to this problem. In essence, the
idea is to consistently account for the underlying energy-momentum conservation
in the presence of a final-state heavy quark-antiquark pair. This automatically
leads to a well-behaved GM-VFNS description of the cross sections across all
$p_{\rm T}$ without a need to fine tune the QCD scales. The results are
compared with the LHCb data and a very good agreement is found. We also compare
to fixed-order based calculations and explain why they lead to approximately a
factor of two lower D-meson production cross sections than the GM-VFNS
approach.

describing hadronic phenomenology, in particular in physical situations for
which an effective theory of the strong interactions such as NRQCD cannot be
applied. As a consequence of its achievements, a relevant question is whether
its model parameters can somehow be related to fundamental constants of QCD. We
shall give a first answer in this article by comparing the predictions of both
approaches. Building on results from a previous study on heavy meson
spectroscopy, we calibrate the Cornell model employing NRQCD predictions for
the lowest-lying bottomonium states up to N$^3$LO, in which the bottom mass is
varied within a wide range. We find that the Cornell model mass parameter can
be identified, within perturbative uncertainties, with the MSR mass at the
scale $R = 1\,$GeV. This identification holds for any value of $\alpha_s$ or
the bottom mass, and for all perturbative orders investigated. Furthermore, we
show that: a) the ""string tension"" parameter is independent of the bottom mass,
and b) the Coulomb strength $\kappa$ of the Cornell model can be related to the
QCD strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ at a characteristic non-relativistic
scale. We also show how to remove the $u=1/2$ renormalon of the static QCD
potential and sum-up large logs related to the renormalon subtraction by
switching to the low-scale, short-distance MSR mass, and using R-evolution. Our
R-improved expression for the static potential remains independent of the heavy
quark mass value and agrees with lattice QCD results for values of the radius
as large as $0.8\,$fm, and with the Cornell model potential at long distances.
Finally we show that for moderate values of $r$, the R-improved NRQCD and
Cornell static potentials are in head-on agreement.

of 230 detached close-orbiting eclipsing binaries with low-mass main-sequence
components in the Catalina Sky Survey. These low-mass stars have masses of $M
\leq 1.0\ M_{\odot}$ and orbital periods shorter than $2$ days. The adopted
method provided a robust estimate of stellar parameters (as mass and fractional
radius) by using only light curves and photometric colours, since no
spectroscopic information was available for these objects. A SDSS-2MASS
ten-colour grid of composite synthetic and observed colours and the K-Nearest
Neighbours method were employed to identify main-sequence stars and to estimate
their effective temperatures, typically of $T_{\rm eff}\leq 5720$ K. Each light
curve was modelled with the JKTEBOP code together with an asexual genetic
algorithm to obtain the most coherent values for the fitted parameters. The
present work provides an unprecedented number of homogeneous estimates of main
stellar parameters in short-period low-mass binary systems. The distribution of
the components of the investigated detached eclipsing binaries in the
mass-radius diagram supports a trend of radius inflation on low-mass
main-sequence stars. A relative increase of inflation for lower masses is also
found and our results suggest that the secondaries are more inflated, i.e. they
present larger radii than the primary components of same mass, when compared to
stellar evolutionary models.

the mild tension between cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements of the

minimal case of the model proposed by Dvali and Funcke (2016) that predicts
late neutrino mass generation in a post-recombination cosmic phase transition,
by assuming that neutrino asymmetries allow for the presence of relic neutrinos
in the late-time Universe. We show that, if the transition is supercooled,
current cosmological data (including CMB temperature, polarization and lensing,
baryon acoustic oscillations, and Type Ia supernovae) prefer the scale factor
$a_s$ of the phase transition to be very large, peaking at $a_s\sim 1$, and
therefore supporting a cosmological scenario in which neutrinos are almost
massless until very recent times. We find that in this scenario the
cosmological bound on the total sum of the neutrino masses today is
significantly weakened compared to the standard case of constant-mass
neutrinos, with $\sum m_\nu<4.8$~eV at 95\% confidence, and in agreement with
the model predictions. The main reason for this weaker bound is a large
correlation arising between the dark energy and neutrino components in the
presence of false vacuum energy that converts into the non-zero neutrino masses
after the transition. This result provides new targets for the coming KATRIN
and PTOLEMY experiments. We also show that the time-varying neutrino mass model
considered here does not provide a clear explanation to the existing

polarization of the cathode, resulting in a small image-charge field. Thereby
mitigating the cathode's space charge limit. In the work presented here, a

(+6)-spanner constructions are essentially the sparsest possible, that is, a
larger additive stretch cannot guarantee a sparser spanner, which brought the
stretch-sparsity trade-off to its limit. Distributed constructions of spanners
are also abundant. However, for additive spanners, while there were algorithms
constructing (+2) and (+4)-all-pairs spanners, the sparsest case of
(+6)-spanners remained elusive.

Somewhat slower expansion is seen elsewhere around the remnant periphery, in

the shock has reached the edge of the cavity. The high shock velocities can
easily accelerate relativistic electrons to X-ray-emitting energies. A few

smart grids such as enhanced grid resilience, effective demand response, and
reduced bills. However, uncoordinated charging of ESUs stresses the power
system and can lead to a blackout. On the other hand, existing charging
coordination mechanisms suffer from several limitations. First, the need for a
central charging coordinator (CC) presents a single point of failure that
jeopardizes the effectiveness of the charging coordination. Second, a
transparent charging coordination mechanism does not exist where users are not
aware whether the CC is honest or not in coordination charging requests among
them in a fair way. Third, existing mechanisms overlook the privacy concerns of
the involved customers. To address these limitations, in this paper, we
leverage the blockchain and smart contracts to build a decentralized charging
coordination mechanism without the need for a centralized charging coordinator.
First ESUs should use tokens for anonymously authenticate themselves to the
blockchain. Then each ESU sends a charging request that contains its
State-of-Charge (SoC), Time-to-complete-charge (TCC) and amount of required
charging to the smart contract address on the blockchain. The smart contract
will then run the charging coordination mechanism in a self-executed manner
such that ESUs with the highest priorities are charged in the present time slot
while charging requests of lower priority ESUs are deferred to future time
slots. In this way, each ESU can make sure that charging schedules are computed
correctly. Finally, we have implemented the proposed mechanism on the Ethereum
test-bed blockchain, and our analysis shows that execution cost can be
acceptable in terms of gas consumption while enabling decentralized charging

distortion correlation are first uncovered. Then, we separately analyze the
distortion correlation caused by third-order non-linearities and by

correlation can be safely neglected in Massive MIMO when there are sufficiently

star NGTS J121939.5-355557, which we estimate as only 2 Myr old. The flare had
an energy of $3.2\pm^{0.4}_{0.3}\times 10^{36}$erg and a fractional amplitude
of $7.2\pm0.8$, making it one of the most energetic flares seen on an M star.
The star is also X-ray active, in the saturated regime with $log L_{X}/L_{Bol}
= -3.1$. In the flare peak we have identified multi-mode quasi-periodic
pulsations formed of two statistically significant periods of approximately 320
and 660 seconds. This flare is one of the largest amplitude events to exhibit
such pulsations. The shorter period mode is observed to start after a
short-lived spike in flux lasting around 30 seconds, which would not have been
resolved in Kepler or TESS short cadence modes. Our data shows how the high
cadence of NGTS can be used to apply solar techniques to stellar flares and
identify potential causes of the observed oscillations. We also discuss the
implications of this flare for the habitability of planets around M star hosts
and how NGTS can aid in our understanding of this.

a sparse subgraph of the given graph that preserves large matchings
approximately and is robust to modifications of the graph. We use this matching
sparsifier to obtain several new algorithmic results for the maximum matching
problem:
  * An almost $(3/2)$-approximation one-way communication protocol for the
maximum matching problem, significantly simplifying the $(3/2)$-approximation
protocol of Goel, Kapralov, and Khanna (SODA 2012) and extending it from
bipartite graphs to general graphs.
  * An almost $(3/2)$-approximation algorithm for the stochastic matching
problem, improving upon and significantly simplifying the previous
$1.999$-approximation algorithm of Assadi, Khanna, and Li (EC 2017).
  * An almost $(3/2)$-approximation algorithm for the fault-tolerant matching
problem, which, to our knowledge, is the first non-trivial algorithm for this
problem.
  Our matching sparsifier is obtained by proving new properties of the
edge-degree constrained subgraph (EDCS) of Bernstein and Stein (ICALP 2015;
SODA 2016)---designed in the context of maintaining matchings in dynamic
graphs---that identifies EDCS as an excellent choice for a matching sparsifier.
This leads to surprisingly simple and non-technical proofs of the above results
in a unified way. Along the way, we also provide a much simpler proof of the
fact that an EDCS is guaranteed to contain a large matching, which may be of
independent interest.

are magnetic vortex-like structures that have low depinning current density and
are robust to defects. A charge current sent through a polarizer ferromagnet
(P-FM) nucleates a skyrmion at the input end of an intra-gate FM interconnect
with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA-FM). The output end of the PMA--FM
forms the free layer of an MTJ stack. A spin Hall metal (SHM) is placed beneath
the PMA-FM. The skyrmion is propagated to the output end of the PMA-FM by
passing a charge current through the SHM. The resistance of the MTJ stack is
low (high) when a skyrmion is present (absent) in the free layer, thereby
realizing an inverter. A framework is developed to analyze the performance of
the SkyLogic device. A circuit-level technique is developed that counters the
transverse displacement of skyrmion in the PMA-FM and allows use of high
current densities for fast propagation. The design space exploration of the
PMA-FM material parameters is performed to obtain an optimal design point. At
the optimal point, we obtain an inverter delay of 434 ps with a switching
energy of 7.1 fJ.

graphs, showing that many important concepts and tools in graph theory and its
applications can be described more naturally (and sometimes proved more easily)
in analytic language. We extend the theory of graph limits to the ordered
setting, presenting a limit object for dense vertex-ordered graphs, which we
call an \emph{orderon}. As a special case, this yields limit objects for
matrices whose rows and columns are ordered, and for dynamic graphs that expand
(via vertex insertions) over time. Along the way, we devise an ordered
locality-preserving variant of the cut distance between ordered graphs, showing
that two graphs are close with respect to this distance if and only if they are
similar in terms of their ordered subgraph frequencies. We show that the space
of orderons is compact with respect to this distance notion, which is key to a
successful analysis of combinatorial objects through their limits.
  We derive several applications of the ordered limit theory in extremal
combinatorics, sampling, and property testing in ordered graphs. In particular,
we prove a new ordered analogue of the well-known result by Alon and Stav
[RS\&A'08] on the furthest graph from a hereditary property; this is the first
known result of this type in the ordered setting. Unlike the unordered regime,
here the random graph model $G(n, p)$ with an ordering over the vertices is
\emph{not} always asymptotically the furthest from the property for some $p$.
However, using our ordered limit theory, we show that random graphs generated
by a stochastic block model, where the blocks are consecutive in the vertex
ordering, are (approximately) the furthest. Additionally, we describe an
alternative analytic proof of the ordered graph removal lemma [Alon et al.,
FOCS'17].

characteristic velocity of galaxies. These scaling laws reflect the way in
which baryons populate, cool, and settle at the center of their host dark
matter halos; the angular momentum they retain in the assembly process; as well
as the radial distribution and mass scalings of the dark matter halos. There
has been steady progress in our understanding of these processes in recent
years, mainly as sophisticated N-body and hydrodynamical simulation techniques
have enabled the numerical realization of galaxy models of ever increasing
complexity, realism, and appeal. These simulations have now clarified the
origin of these galaxy scaling laws in a universe dominated by cold dark
matter: these relations arise from the tight (but highly non-linear) relations
between (i) galaxy mass and halo mass, (ii) galaxy size and halo characteristic
radius; and (iii) from the self-similar mass nature of cold dark matter halo
mass profiles. The excellent agreement between simulated and observed galaxy
scaling laws is a resounding success for the LCDM cosmogony on the highly
non-linear scales of individual galaxies.

of GANs the governing physical laws in the form of stochastic differential

Wasserstein GANs with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) for its enhanced stability
compared to vanilla GANs. We first tested WGAN-GP in approximating Gaussian
processes of different correlation lengths based on data realizations collected
from simultaneous reads at sparsely placed sensors. We obtained good
approximation of the generated stochastic processes to the target ones even for
a mismatch between the input noise dimensionality and the effective
dimensionality of the target stochastic processes. We also studied the
overfitting issue for both the discriminator and generator, and we found that
overfitting occurs also in the generator in addition to the discriminator as
previously reported. Subsequently, we considered the solution of elliptic SDEs
requiring approximations of three stochastic processes, namely the solution,
the forcing, and the diffusion coefficient. We used three generators for the
PI-GANs, two of them were feed forward deep neural networks (DNNs) while the
other one was the neural network induced by the SDE. Depending on the data, we
employed one or multiple feed forward DNNs as the discriminators in PI-GANs.
Here, we have demonstrated the accuracy and effectiveness of PI-GANs in solving
SDEs for up to 30 dimensions, but in principle, PI-GANs could tackle very high

  Issue 2, Article 3","10.22152/programming-journal.org/2019/3/3",,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context. Recent studies show that developers spend most of their programming
time testing, verifying and debugging software. As applications become more and
more complex, developers demand more advanced debugging support to ease the
software development process.
  Inquiry. Since the 70's many debugging solutions were introduced. Amongst
them, online debuggers provide a good insight on the conditions that led to a
bug, allowing inspection and interaction with the variables of the program.
However, most of the online debugging solutions introduce \textit{debugging
interference} to the execution of the program, i.e. pauses, latency, and
evaluation of code containing side-effects.
  Approach. This paper investigates a novel debugging technique called
\outofplace debugging. The goal is to minimize the debugging interference
characteristic of online debugging while allowing online remote capabilities.
An \outofplace debugger transfers the program execution and application state
from the debugged application to the debugger application, both running in
different processes.
  Knowledge. On the one hand, \outofplace debugging allows developers to debug
applications remotely, overcoming the need of physical access to the machine
where the debugged application is running. On the other hand, debugging happens
locally on the remote machine avoiding latency. That makes it suitable to be
deployed on a distributed system and handle the debugging of several processes
running in parallel.
  Grounding. We implemented a concrete out-of-place debugger for the Pharo
Smalltalk programming language. We show that our approach is practical by
performing several benchmarks, comparing our approach with a classic remote
online debugger. We show that our prototype debugger outperforms by a 1000
times a traditional remote debugger in several scenarios. Moreover, we show
that the presence of our debugger does not impact the overall performance of an
application.
  Importance. This work combines remote debugging with the debugging experience
of a local online debugger. Out-of-place debugging is the first online
debugging technique that can minimize debugging interference while debugging a
remote application. Yet, it still keeps the benefits of online debugging ( e.g.
step-by-step execution). This makes the technique suitable for modern
applications which are increasingly parallel, distributed and reactive to
streams of data from various sources like sensors, UI, network, etc.

programming, therefore, it would be a glaring omission to not involve people
who specialize in studying artifacts and the human activity that yields them:
archaeologists. Here we consider this with respect to computer games, the focus
of archaeology's nascent subarea of archaeogaming.
  One type of archaeogaming research is digital excavation, a technical
examination of the code and techniques used in old games' implementation. We
apply that in a case study of Entombed, an Atari 2600 game released in 1982 by
US Games. The player in this game is, appropriately, an archaeologist who must
make their way through a zombie-infested maze. Maze generation is a fruitful
area for comparative retrogame archaeology, because a number of early games on
different platforms featured mazes, and their variety of approaches can be
compared. The maze in Entombed is particularly interesting: it is shaped in
part by the extensive real-time constraints of the Atari 2600 platform, and
also had to be generated efficiently and use next to no memory. We reverse
engineered key areas of the game's code to uncover its unusual maze-generation
algorithm, which we have also built a reconstruction of, and analyzed the
mysterious table that drives it. In addition, we discovered what appears to be
a 35-year-old bug in the code, as well as direct evidence of code-reuse
practices amongst game developers.
  What further makes this game's development interesting is that, in an era
where video games were typically solo projects, a total of five people were
involved in various ways with Entombed. We piece together some of the backstory
of the game's development and intoxicant-fueled design using interviews to
complement our technical work.
  Finally, we contextualize this example in archaeology and lay the groundwork
for a broader interdisciplinary discussion about programming, one that includes
both computer scientists and archaeologists.

criterion for a spectrally stable quantum emitter. We find that identical
electron density in ground and excited states can eliminate the coupling to the
stray electric fields. Further, a strong optical transition dipole moment is
achieved in systems with altering sign of the ground and excited wavefunctions.
We use density functional perturbation theory to investigate an optical center
that lacks of inversion symmetry. Our results show that this system close to

generating completely new trajectories for each planning problem, our approach
allows for extensions such as persistent control policy information associated

sources (ULXs) exhibit X-ray pulsations, and are therefore powered by
super-Eddington accretion onto magnetized neutron stars (NSs). For typical ULX
mass accretion rates ($\gtrsim 10^{19}\,{\rm g\,s^{-1}}$), the inner parts of
the accretion disc are expected to be in the supercritical regime, meaning that
some material is lost in a wind launched from the disc surface, while the rest
forms an optically thick envelope around the NS as it follows magnetic field
lines from the inner disc radius to the magnetic poles of the star. The
envelope hides the central object from a distant observer and defines key
observational properties of ULX pulsars: their energy spectrum, polarization,
and timing features. The optical thickness of the envelope is affected by the
mass losses from the disc. We calculate the mass loss rate due to the wind in
ULX pulsars, accounting for the NS magnetic field strength and advection
processes in the disc. We argue that the detection of strong outflows from ULX
pulsars can be considered evidence of a relatively weak dipole component of the
NS magnetic field. We estimate the influence of mass losses on the optical
thickness of the envelope and analyze how the envelope affects broadband
aperiodic variability in ULXs. We show that brightness fluctuations at high
Fourier frequencies can be strongly suppressed by multiple scatterings in the
envelope and that the strength of suppression is determined by the mass
accretion rate and geometrical size of the magnetosphere.

this paper, we aim to design HARQ schemes using multilevel polar

set-partitioning based bit-to-symbol mapping for high order QAM constellations.
We simplify the LLR estimation of set-partitioned QAM constellations for a

throughput-maximizing MLPCM for the successive cancellation decoding (SCD).
These codes are specifically useful for non-combining (NC) and Chase-combining

for SC list decoders (SCLD), we propose a rate matching algorithm to find the
best rate for SCLD while using the polar codes optimized for SCD. The resulting
codes provide throughput close to the capacity with low decoding complexity
when used with NC or CC HARQ.

spectra that cover the Na doublet in the atmosphere of the exoplanet XO-2 b. To
assess the consistency of our results, observations were obtained from two
separate platforms: Gemini/GMOS and Mayall/KOSMOS. To mitigate the systematic
errors, we chose XO-2, because it has a binary companion of the same brightness
and stellar type, which provides an ideal reference star to model Earth's
atmospheric effects. We find that interpretation of the data is highly
sensitive to time-varying translations along the detector, which change
according to wavelength and differ between the target and reference star. It
was necessary to employ a time-dependent cross-correlation to align our
wavelength bins and correct for atmospheric differential refraction. This
approach allows us to resolve the wings of the Na line across 5 wavelength bins
at a resolution of $\sim$1.6nm and limit the abundance of Na. We obtain
consistent results from each telescope with a Na amplitude of 521$\pm$161 ppm

CTC are improved by incorporating acoustic landmarks. We tailored a new set of
acoustic landmarks to help CTC training converge more rapidly and smoothly
while also reducing recognition error rates. We leveraged new target label
sequences mixed with both phone and manner changes to guide CTC training.
Experiments on TIMIT demonstrated that CTC based acoustic models converge
significantly faster and smoother when they are augmented by acoustic
landmarks. The models pretrained with mixed target labels can be further
finetuned, resulting in phone error rates 8.72% below baseline on TIMIT.
Consistent performance gain is also observed on WSJ (a larger corpus) and
reduced TIMIT (smaller). With WSJ, we are the first to succeed in verifying the
effectiveness of acoustic landmark theory on a mid-sized ASR task.

chromodynamics (QCD). Skyrmions offer a novel approach to this problem by
considering nuclei as solitons of a low energy effective field theory obtained
from QCD. Unfortunately, the standard theory of Skyrmions has been plagued by
two significant problems, in that it yields nuclear binding energies that are
an order of magnitude larger than experimental nuclear data, and it predicts
intrinsic shapes for nuclei that fail to match the clustering structure of
light nuclei. Here we show that extending the standard theory of Skyrmions, by
including the next lightest subatomic meson particles traditionally neglected,
dramatically improves both these aspects. We find Skyrmion clustering that now
agrees with the expected structure of light nuclei, with binding energies that

and training of deep re-ID model. For virtual person generation, we learn a
person generation model and a camera style transfer model using unlabeled real
data to generate virtual persons with different poses and camera styles. The
virtual data is formed as labeled training data, enabling subsequently training
deep re-ID model in supervision. For training of deep re-ID model, we divide it
into three steps: 1) pre-training a coarse re-ID model by using virtual data;
2) collaborative filtering based positive pair mining from the real data; and
3) fine-tuning of the coarse re-ID model by leveraging the mined positive pairs
and virtual data. The final re-ID model is achieved by iterating between step 2
and step 3 until convergence. Experimental results on two large-scale datasets,
Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach

low-mass ($M_{\rm planet} < 0.7M_{\rm Jup} $) planets, known as the `Planet
Desert'. Current radial velocity methods have yet to yield close-in, low-mass
planets around these stars because the planetary signals could be hidden by the
(5-10) m s$^{-1}$ radial velocity variations caused by acoustic oscillations.
We find that by implementing an observing strategy of taking three observations
per night separated by an optimal $\Delta t$, which is a function of the
oscillation periods and amplitudes, we can average over the stellar jitter and
improve our sensitivity to low-mass planets. We find $\Delta t$ can be
approximated using the stellar mass and radius given by the relationship
$\Delta t = $1.79 $(M/M_{\odot})^{-0.82} ~(R/R_{\odot})^{1.92}$. We test our
proposed method by injecting planets into very well sampled data of a subgiant
star, $\gamma$ Cep. We compare the fraction of planets recovered by our method
to the fraction of planets recovered using current radial velocity
observational strategies. We find that our method decreases the RMS of the
stellar jitter due to acoustic oscillations by a factor of three over current

design a new succinct rank data structure with $r=n/(\log

asks for an unbiased characterization of their properties including a stability
analysis. We propose a novel technique to measure the spectrum of filaments in
any two-dimensional data set. Using anisotropic wavelets we can quantify and
distinguish local and global anisotropies and measure the size distribution of
filaments. The wavelet analysis does not need any assumptions on the alignment
or shape of filaments in the maps, but directly measures their typical spatial
dimensions. In a rigorous test program, we calibrate the scale-dependence of
the method and test the angular and spatial sensitivity. We apply the method to
molecular line maps from magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and observed
column density maps from Herschel observations.
  When applying the anisotropic wavelet analysis to the MHD data, we find that
the observed filament sizes depend on the combination of magnetic-field
dominated density-velocity correlations with radiative transfer effects. This
can be exploited by observing tracers with different optical depth to measure
the transition from a globally ordered large-scale structure to small-scale
filaments with entangled field lines. The unbiased view to Herschel column
density maps does not confirm a universal characteristic filament width. The

tensor-dimensions to be split across any dimensions of a multi-dimensional mesh
of processors. A Mesh-TensorFlow graph compiles into a SPMD program consisting
of parallel operations coupled with collective communication primitives such as
Allreduce. We use Mesh-TensorFlow to implement an efficient data-parallel,
model-parallel version of the Transformer sequence-to-sequence model. Using TPU

scattering, which produces spectral distortions of the emission lines from the

Implementation of the test is intuitive and simple, and does not require any

rely on the sparsity of the density matrix. Linear (and often sub-linear)
scaling is achieved by introducing a controlled statistical error in the
density, energy and forces. The statistical error (noise) is proportional to
the inverse square root of the number of stochastic orbitals and thus decreases
slowly, however, by dividing the system to fragments that are embedded
stochastically, the statistical error can be reduced significantly. This has
been shown to provide remarkable results for non-covalently bonded systems,
however, the application to covalently bonded systems had limited success,
particularly for delocalized electrons. Here, we show that the statistical
error in the density correlates with both the density and the density matrix of
the system and propose a new fragmentation scheme that elegantly interpolates
between overlapped fragments. We assess the performance of the approach for
bulk silicon of varying supercell sizes (up to $N_{e}=16384$ electrons) and
show that overlapped fragments reduce significantly the statistical noise even

are shown to be not informative enough to predict accurate DTIs. Thus, in this
study, we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) on raw protein sequences
to capture local residue patterns participating in DTIs. With CNN on protein

In this work, we address the class of 2-tessellable quantum walks with the goal

define the concept of quantum detailed balance, which helps to obtain the
eigenbasis. A subset of the eigenvectors is obtained from the eigenvectors of
the double discriminant matrix of the quantum Markov chain. To obtain the
remaining eigenvectors, we have to use the quantum detailed balance conditions.
If the quantum Markov chain has a quantum detailed balance, there is an
eigenvector for each fundamental cycle of the underlying multigraph. If the
quantum Markov chain does not have a quantum detailed balance, we have to use
two fundamental cycles linked by a path in order to find the remaining
eigenvectors. We exemplify the process of obtaining the eigenbasis of the

schedule for the QFT on a ladder results in running time close to that of a

the low-frequency radio emission is the mixture of extended and core components

computer audition, analogous to image segmentation in visual scene analysis.
Source separation systems based on deep learning are currently the most
successful approaches for solving the underdetermined separation problem, where
there are more sources than channels. Traditionally, such systems are trained
on sound mixtures where the ground truth decomposition is already known. Since
most real-world recordings do not have such a decomposition available, this
limits the range of mixtures one can train on, and the range of mixtures the
learned models may successfully separate. In this work, we use a simple blind
spatial source separation algorithm to generate estimated decompositions of
stereo mixtures. These estimates, together with a weighting scheme in the
time-frequency domain, based on confidence in the separation quality, are used
to train a deep learning model that can be used for single-channel separation,
where no source direction information is available. This demonstrates how a
simple cue such as the direction of origin of source can be used to bootstrap a
model for source separation that can be used in situations where that cue is
not available.

transistor dimension to further increase device performance. In-plane edge
contacts have the potential to achieve lower contact resistance due to stronger
orbital hybridization compared to conventional top contacts. However, a
quantitative understanding of the electron transport properties in the edge
contact is still lacking. In this work, we present full-band atomistic quantum
transport simulations of the graphene/MoS$_2$ edge contact. By using a Wannier
function basis to accurately describe the electronic bands, together with a
full self-consistent solution of the electrostatics, we are able to efficiently
model device structures on a micron scale, but with atomic level accuracy. We
find that the potential barrier created by trapped charges decays fast with
distance away from the interface, and is thus thin enough to enable efficient
injection of electrons. This results in Ohmic behavior in its I-V
characteristics, which agrees with experiments. Our results demonstrate the
role played by trapped charges in the formation of a Schottky barrier, and how
one can reduce the Schottky barrier height (SBH) by adjusting the relevant
parameters of the edge contact system. Our framework can be extended
conveniently to incorporate more general nanostructure geometries. For example,
a full 3D solution of the electrostatics will also lead to better modeling of
the electrical potential. Furthermore, better ab-initio calculations can be
conveniently added to our methods to further improve their accuracy.

contrast to global segmentation in which all objects are segmented, selective
segmentation is used to isolate specific objects in an image and is of
particular interest in medical imaging -- permitting segmentation and review of
a single organ. An important consideration is to minimise the amount of user
input to obtain the segmentation; this differs from interactive segmentation in
which more user input is allowed than selective segmentation. To achieve
selection, we propose a selective segmentation model which uses the
edge-weighted geodesic distance from a marker set as a penalty term. It is
demonstrated that this edge-weighted geodesic penalty term improves on previous
selective penalty terms. A convex formulation of the model is also presented,
allowing arbitrary initialisation. It is shown that the proposed model is less
parameter dependent and requires less user input than previous models. Further
modifications are made to the edge-weighted geodesic distance term to ensure
segmentation robustness to noise and blur. We can show that the overall
Euler-Lagrange equation admits a unique viscosity solution. Numerical results
show that the result is robust to user input and permits selective
segmentations that are not possible with other models.

a particle in a black hole is universally bounded from above by the surface
gravity of the black hole. On the other hand, the minimal length appears in
various theories of quantum gravity and leads to the deformed canonical
position-momentum commutation relation. In this paper, we use the
Hamilton-Jacobi method to study effects of the minimal length on the motion of
a massive particle perturbed away from an unstable equilibrium near the black
hole horizon. We find that the minimal length effects make the particle move
faster away from the equilibrium, and hence the corresponding Lyapunov exponent
is greater than that in the usual case with the absence of the minimal length.
It therefore shows that if the minimal length effects are taken into account,
the conjectured universal bound on the Lyapunov exponent could be violated.

domains. It is well recognized that computation times on distributed clusters
are often dominated by the slowest workers (called stragglers). Recent work has
demonstrated that straggler mitigation can be viewed as a problem of designing
erasure codes. For matrices $\mathbf A$ and $\mathbf B$, the technique
essentially maps the computation of $\mathbf A^T \mathbf B$ into the
multiplication of smaller (coded) submatrices. The stragglers are treated as
erasures in this process. The computation can be completed as long as a certain
number of workers (called the recovery threshold) complete their assigned
tasks.
  We present a novel coding strategy for this problem when the absolute values
of the matrix entries are sufficiently small. We demonstrate a tradeoff between
the assumed absolute value bounds on the matrix entries and the recovery

traffic-agents (vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians, etc.). A challenging and
critical task is to explore the movement patterns of different traffic-agents
and predict their future trajectories accurately to help the autonomous vehicle
make reasonable navigation decision. To solve this problem, we propose a long
short-term memory-based (LSTM-based) realtime traffic prediction algorithm,
TrafficPredict. Our approach uses an instance layer to learn instances'
movements and interactions and has a category layer to learn the similarities
of instances belonging to the same type to refine the prediction. In order to
evaluate its performance, we collected trajectory datasets in a large city
consisting of varying conditions and traffic densities. The dataset includes
many challenging scenarios where vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians move among
one another. We evaluate the performance of TrafficPredict on our new dataset
and highlight its higher accuracy for trajectory prediction by comparing with
prior prediction methods.

the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. Here, we report the discovery of a rare
large double lobed radio source with its radio core associated with a NLSy1
galaxy SDSS J103024.95+551622.7 at z = 0.435. The lobe separation is 116 kpc
which is the second largest known projected size among NLSy1 radio sources.
This finding is based on the analysis of 1.4 GHz data from the Faint Images of
the Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (FIRST) archives. Along with the core and
edge-brightened lobes we detected significant (30%) fraction of clear diffuse
emission showing typical back-flow from FR II radio galaxy lobes. For the
source, we estimated a jet power of $3 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ suggesting
that its jet power is similar to that of classical radio galaxies. Emission
from the source is also found to be non-variable both in the optical and
mid-infrared bands. Identification of more such sources may help to reveal new
modes of AGN and understand their role in black hole galaxy evolution.

demonstrate this method in a pair of stray field coupled magnetic vortex

is inherently parallel due to the characteristics of generative flow. The model

embedding, which yields a primal-dual solution or a certificate establishing
primal or dual infeasibility. Following Patrinos (and others, 2018), we express
the embedding as the problem of finding a zero of a mapping containing a
skew-symmetric linear function and projections onto cones and their duals. We
focus on the special case when this mapping is regular, i.e., differentiable
with nonsingular derivative matrix, at a solution point. While this is not
always the case, it is a very common occurrence in practice. We propose a
simple method that uses LSQR, a variant of conjugate gradients for least
squares problems, and the derivative of the residual mapping to refine an
approximate solution, i.e., to increase its accuracy. LSQR is a matrix-free
method, i.e., requires only the evaluation of the derivative mapping and its
adjoint, and so avoids forming or storing large matrices, which makes it
efficient even for cone problems in which the data matrices are given and
dense, and also allows the method to extend to cone programs in which the data
are given as abstract linear operators. Numerical examples show that the method
almost always improves an approximate solution of a conic program, and often
dramatically, at a computational cost that is typically small compared to the
cost of obtaining the original approximate solution. For completeness we
describe methods for computing the derivative of the projection onto the cones
commonly used in practice: nonnegative, second-order, semidefinite, and
exponential cones. The paper is accompanied by an open source implementation.

simulations of fully-filled, non-isothermal polymer melt flow in the

local flow pattern are analyzed by the distribution of the strain-rate state.
The distribution of the finite-time Lyapunov exponent reveals a large
inhomogeneity of the mixing in FKD is suppressed both by the forward and
backward tips. By the forward tips on FKD, the mixing ability is relatively
suppressed compared to FKD, whereas for the backward tips on FKD, the mixing
ability is enhanced while maintaining the same level of dispersion efficiency
as FKD. From these results, the pitched tips on the conventional KD turns out
to be effective at reducing the inhomogeneity of the mixing and tuning the

unlike existing literature that uses Laplacian embedding for graph based
learning problems, we use a richer class of graph
embeddings---\emph{orthonormal representations}---that includes (normalized)
Laplacian as its special case. Our proposed algorithm, {\it Pref-Rank},
predicts the underlying ranking using an SVM based approach over the chosen
embedding of the product graph, and is the first to provide \emph{statistical

smaller for dense graphs, with $\chi(\bar G)$ characterizing the degree of node
connectivity, which is also intuitive due to the locality assumption e.g.
$O(n^\frac{4}{3})$ for union of $k$-cliques, or $O(n^\frac{5}{3})$ for random

better network management and future planning. With the advent of high traffic
loads due to Cloud Computing platforms and Software Defined Networking based
tunable routing and traffic management algorithms on the Internet, it is more
necessary as ever to be able to predict current and future traffic volumes on
the network. For large networks such origin-destination traffic prediction
problem takes the form of a large under-constrained and under-determined system
of equations with a dynamic measurement matrix. In this work, we present our
Compressed Sensing with Dynamic Model Estimation (CS-DME) architecture suitable
for modern software defined networks. Our main contributions are: (1) we
formulate an approach in which measurement matrix in the compressed sensing
scheme can be accurately and dynamically estimated through a reformulation of
the problem based on traffic demands. (2) We show that the problem formulation
using a dynamic measurement matrix based on instantaneous traffic demands may
be used instead of a stationary binary routing matrix which is more suitable to
modern Software Defined Networks that are constantly evolving in terms of
routing by inspection of its Eigen Spectrum using two real world datasets. (3)
We also show that linking this compressed measurement matrix dynamically with
the measured parameters can lead to acceptable estimation of Origin Destination
(OD) Traffic flows with marginally poor results with other state-of-art schemes
relying on fixed measurement matrices. (4) Furthermore, using this compressed
reformulated problem, a new strategy for selection of vantage points for most
efficient traffic matrix estimation is also presented through a secondary
compression technique based on subset of link measurements.

quasi two-body QCD factorization approach. Both the resonance and the
nonresonance contributions are studied for the $B^-\rightarrow K^-\pi^+\pi^-$
decay. The resonance contributions include those not only from $[\pi\pi]$
channels including $\sigma(600)$, $\rho^0(770)$ and $\omega(782)$ but also from
$[K\pi]$ channels including $K^*(892)$, $K_0^*(1430)$, $K^*(1410)$, $K^*(1680)$
and $K_2^*(1430)$. By fitting the experimental data
$\mathcal{A_{CP}}(K^-\pi^+\pi^-)=0.678\pm0.078\pm0.0323\pm0.007$ for
$m_{K^-\pi^+}^2<15$ $\mathrm{GeV}^2$ and $0.08<m_{\pi^+\pi^-}^2<0.66$
$\mathrm{GeV}^2$, we get the end-point divergence parameters in our model,
$\phi_S \in [4.75, 5.95]$ and $\rho_S\in[4.2, 8]$. Using these results for
$\rho_S$ and $\phi_S$, we predict that the $CP$ asymmetry parameter
$\mathcal{A_{CP}} \in [-0.094, -0.034]$ and the branching fraction $\mathcal{B}
\in [1.82, 20.0]\times10^{-5}$ for the $B^-\rightarrow K^-\sigma(600)$ decay.
In addition, we also analyse contributions to the localized $CP$ asymmetry
$\mathcal{A_{CP}}(B^-\rightarrow K^-\pi^+\pi^-)$ from $[\pi\pi]$, $[K\pi]$
channel resonances and nonresonance individually, which are found to be
$\mathcal{A_{CP}}(B^-\rightarrow K^-[\pi^+\pi^-] \rightarrow
K^-\pi^+\pi^-)=0.585\pm0.045$, $\mathcal{A_{CP}}(B^-\rightarrow [K^-\pi^+] \pi

$\mathcal{A_{CP}}^{NR}(B^-\rightarrow K^-\pi^+\pi^-)=0.061\pm0.0042$,
respectively. Comparing these results, we can see that the localized $CP$
asymmetry in the $B^-\rightarrow K^-\pi^+\pi^-$ decay is mainly induced by the
$[\pi\pi]$ channel resonances while contributions from the $[K\pi]$ channel
resonances and nonresonance are both very small.

number of sinusoids, and the coefficient of each sinusoid. For a fixed period,
we recently proposed a model for optimizing the coefficients using

demonstrate that the approximation can be improved by taking the period into

optimal strategy in the distributional variant of the game: let $\mu$ be a

optimal strategy that recovers $x\sim \mu$ is between $H(\mu)$ and $H(\mu)+1$.
We consider an extension of this game where at most $k$ questions can be
answered falsely. We extend the classical result by showing that an optimal
strategy uses roughly $H(\mu) + k H_2(\mu)$ questions, where $H_2(\mu) = \sum_x

robotics, the underlying trajectory distribution is dynamic because it is a
function of the policy. Recent results show it is possible to prove convergence
of DAgger when a regularity condition on the rate of change of the trajectory
distributions is satisfied. In this article, we reframe this result using
dynamic regret theory from the field of online optimization and show that
dynamic regret can be applied to any on-policy algorithm to analyze its
convergence and optimality. These results inspire a new algorithm, Adaptive
On-Policy Regularization (AOR), that ensures the conditions for convergence. We
present simulation results with cart-pole balancing and locomotion benchmarks
that suggest AOR can significantly decrease dynamic regret and chattering as
the robot learns. To our knowledge, this the first application of dynamic
regret theory to imitation learning.

known to be very flare-productive. However, the physical mechanisms behind this
statistical inference have not been demonstrated conclusively. We show that
such PILs can occur due to the collision between two emerging flux tubes nested
within the same AR. In such multipolar ARs, the flux tubes may emerge
simultaneously or sequentially, each initially producing a bipolar magnetic
region (BMR) at the surface. During each flux tube's emergence phase, the
magnetic polarities can migrate such that opposite polarities belonging to
different BMRs collide, resulting in shearing and cancellation of magnetic
flux. We name this process 'collisional shearing' to emphasize that the
shearing and flux cancellation develops due to the collision. Collisional
shearing is a process different from the known concept of flux cancellation
occurring between polarities of a single bipole, a process that has been
commonly used in many numerical models. High spatial and temporal resolution
observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory for two emerging ARs, AR11158
and AR12017, show the continuous cancellation of up to 40% of the unsigned
magnetic flux of the smallest BMR, which occurs at the collisional PIL for as
long as the collision persists. The flux cancellation is accompanied by a
succession of solar flares and CMEs, products of magnetic reconnection along
the collisional PIL. Our results suggest that the quantification of magnetic
cancellation driven by collisional shearing needs to be taken into
consideration in order to improve the prediction of solar energetic events and
space weather.

analysis of safety-critical systems that operate over a sequence of time steps,
such as aircraft collision avoidance systems and autonomous cars. In many
applications such as autonomous driving, failures cannot be completely
eliminated due to the complex stochastic environment in which the system
operates. As a result, safety validation is not only concerned about whether a
failure can occur, but also discovering which failures are most likely to
occur. This article presents adaptive stress testing (AST), a framework for
finding the most likely path to a failure event in simulation. We consider a
general black box setting for partially observable and continuous-valued
systems operating in an environment with stochastic disturbances. We formulate
the problem as a Markov decision process and use reinforcement learning to
optimize it. The approach is simulation-based and does not require internal
knowledge of the system, making it suitable for black-box testing of large
systems. We present formulations for fully observable and partially observable
systems. In the latter case, we present a modified Monte Carlo tree search
algorithm that only requires access to the pseudorandom number generator of the
simulator to overcome partial observability. We also present an extension of
the framework, called differential adaptive stress testing (DAST), that can
find failures that occur in one system but not in another. This type of
differential analysis is useful in applications such as regression testing,
where we are concerned with finding areas of relative weakness compared to a
baseline. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on an aircraft
collision avoidance application, where a prototype aircraft collision avoidance
system is stress tested to find the most likely scenarios of near mid-air
collision.

localizing temporal boundaries as that of assigning probabilities on each
equally divided unit of this interval. These generated probabilities provide
useful information regarding the boundary location of the action inside this
search interval. Based on these probabilities, we introduce a boundary
pinpointing paradigm to pinpoint the accurate boundaries under a simple
probabilistic framework. Compared with other C3D feature based detectors,
extensive experiments demonstrate that BLP significantly improves the
localization performance of recent state-of-the-art detectors, and achieves
competitive detection mAP on both THUMOS' 14 and ActivityNet datasets,

processes around a low-luminosity supermassive black hole (SMBH). Recent X-ray
observations have allowed for spatially resolved modeling of the emission from
the accretion flow around the SMBH, placing tight constraints on the flux and
spectral shape of the accretion from the inner region with $r<10^3~r_g$, where
$r_g$ is the gravitational radius of the black hole. We present here the first
modeling of the multi-band spectral energy distribution (SED) of this inner
region to better constrain the physical condition of the innermost accretion
flow. Our modeling uses the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to fit the
SED, accounting for the limitations on the accretion rate at the outer radius
of $10^3~r_g$ from the earlier works and the domination of the accretion flow
within $30~r_g$ to the sub-mm bump. It is found that the fitting results of the
outflow index could be very different. If only the most luminous part of the
SED, the sub-mm bump, is considered, the outflow index is about 0, while if
low-frequency radio data and X-ray data are also included, the outflow index
could be 0.37 or even higher. The great difference of the fitting results
indicates that the outflow index should be variable along radius, with a strong
outflow in the outer region and a weak outflow in the innermost region. Such
weak outflow agrees with numerical simulations and is possible to explain the
multi-band SED even better.

The original Capsule relies on the existence of a spatial relationship between

permutation invariant formulations of 3D point set classification methods, such
relationships are typically lost. Here, a new layer called ComposeCaps is
introduced that, in lieu of a spatially relevant feature mapping, learns a new
mapping that can be exploited by the 3DCapsule. Previous works in the 3D point
set classification domain have focused on other parts of the architecture,
whereas instead, the 3DCapsule is a drop-in replacement of the commonly used
fully connected classifier. It is demonstrated via an ablation study, that when
the 3DCapsule is applied to recent 3D point set classification architectures,
it consistently shows an improvement, in particular when subjected to noisy
data. Similarly, the ComposeCaps layer is evaluated and demonstrates an
improvement over the baseline. In an apples-to-apples comparison against

which is beamed due to its relativistic motion. In terms of such a model, we
interpret recently discovered TeV gamma-ray emission from the kpc scale jets in
Cen~A. Interestingly, due to the geometry of the inverse Compton scattering
process, intensity of the gamma-ray emission from the counter-jet is predicted
to be on a higher level than the emission from the jet. This is true provided
that both, a jet and a counter-jet, are twins, i.e. the physical processes in
the jet and counter-jet result in the acceleration of particles in a similar
way. However, in general, the jet and counter-jet can differ significantly.
Therefore, their relative contribution to the gamma-ray emission from the jets
in Cen~A can become more complicated. Investigation of the distribution of the

the lack of all likely patterns needed to train suitable supervised learning
models. This problem accentuates when the fraudulent patterns are not only
scarce, they also change over time. Change in fraudulent pattern is because
fraudsters continue to innovate novel ways to circumvent measures put in place
to prevent fraud. Limited data and continuously changing patterns makes
learning significantly difficult. We hypothesize that good behavior does not
change with time and data points representing good behavior have consistent
spatial signature under different groupings. Based on this hypothesis we are
proposing an approach that detects outliers in large data sets by assigning a
consistency score to each data point using an ensemble of clustering methods.
Our main contribution is proposing a novel method that can detect outliers in
large datasets and is robust to changing patterns. We also argue that area
under the ROC curve, although a commonly used metric to evaluate outlier
detection methods is not the right metric. Since outlier detection problems
have a skewed distribution of classes, precision-recall curves are better
suited because precision compares false positives to true positives (outliers)
rather than true negatives (inliers) and therefore is not affected by the
problem of class imbalance. We show empirically that area under the
precision-recall curve is a better than ROC as an evaluation metric. The
proposed approach is tested on the modified version of the Landsat satellite
dataset, the modified version of the ann-thyroid dataset and a large real world
credit card fraud detection dataset available through Kaggle where we show
significant improvement over the baseline methods.

estimate the physical properties of 57 GMFs. The GMFs show correlations between
the 13CO line width, mass, and size, similar to Larson's relations. We identify
36 394 infrared excess sources in 57 GMFs and obtain SFRs for 46 GMFs. The
median SFR surface density (Sigma_SFR) and star formation efficiency (SFE) of
GMFs are 0.62 Msun Myr-1 pc-2 and 1%, similar to the nearby star-forming

0.002-0.05 with the median value of 0.02. We also find a strong correlation
between SFR and dense gas mass that is defined as gas mass above a visual
extinction of 7 mag, which suggests that the SFRs of the GMFs scale similarly
with dense gas as those of nearby molecular clouds. We also find a strong
correlation between the mean SFR per unit length and dense gas mass per unit
length. The origin of this scaling remains unknown, calling for further studies

eigenvalue shrinkers for use with these estimated principal components.
Underlying these methods are new asymptotic results for the high-dimensional
spiked model with heteroscedastic noise, and consistent estimators for the
relevant population parameters. We extend previous analysis on out-of-sample
prediction to the setting of predictors with whitening. We demonstrate certain
advantages of noise whitening. Specifically, we show that in a certain
asymptotic regime, optimal singular value shrinkage with whitening converges to
the best linear predictor, whereas without whitening it converges to a
suboptimal linear predictor. We prove that for generic signals, whitening
improves estimation of the principal components, and increases a natural
signal-to-noise ratio of the observations. We also show that for rank one
signals, our estimated principal components achieve the asymptotic minimax
rate.

transmitting UL pilots in its cell and in nearby cells, provided K<=Q^2. Such
knowledge of the large-scale channel gains of nearby out-of-cells users can be
exploited at the BS to mitigate interference to the out-of-cell users that
experience the highest levels of interference from the BS. We investigate the

We investigate the use of non-orthogonal uplink pilot designs as a means for
improving the area spectral efficiency in the downlink of such massive MIMO

orthogonal within each cell, while maintaining low inner-product properties

observations on these codes, each cell independently serves its locally active
users with MU-MIMO transmission that is also designed to mitigate interference
to a subset of `strongly interfered' out-of-cell users. As our simulation-based

user-rate CDF improvement with respect to conventional operation, which can be

  Brazil",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There is an increasing body of evidence that suggests that Be disks are well
described by the Viscous Decretion Disk (VDD) model according to which the
formation and structure of the disk depend on the kinematic viscosity of the
gas. However, most observational tests of the VDD to-date were done for systems
that do not display strong temporal variability. From this analysis we (1)
obtain a realistic physical model of the circumstellar environment; (2) measure
the viscosity parameter of the gas, both during the formation and dissipation
phases of the disk; (3) obtain a reliable estimate of the stellar mass and
angular momentum loss rates during outburst. Our simulations suggests that the
VDD model adequately describes the structural evolution of the disk.
Furthermore, our analysis allowed us to determine the viscosity parameter a, as
well as the net mass and angular momentum (AM) loss rates. We find that a is
variable, ranging from 0.1 to 1.0, not only from cycle to cycle but also within
a given cycle. Additionally, build-up phases have larger values of a than the
dissipation phases. We also find that, contrary to what is generally assumed,
during dissipation the outward AM flux is not necessarily zero, meaning that
{\omega} CMa does not experience a true quiescence but, instead, switches
between a high AM loss rate state to a low AM loss rate one during which the
disk quickly assumes an overall lower density but never zero. We confront the
average AM loss rate with predictions from stellar evolution models for
fast-rotating stars, and find that our measurements are smaller by more than
one order of magnitude. The model developed using the V-band photometry as a
constraint was applied to several other observables. Overall, the results of
this multi-technique study were very positive, with a good match for multi-band
photometry, polarization, and most spectroscopic characteristics.

methods have achieved great success in visual tracking. However, the
multi-resolution convolutional feature maps trained from other tasks like image
classification, cannot be naturally used in the conventional DCF formulation.
Furthermore, these high-dimensional feature maps significantly increase the
tracking complexity and thus limit the tracking speed. In this paper, we
present a deep and shallow feature learning network, namely DSNet, to learn the
multi-level same-resolution compressed (MSC) features for efficient online
tracking, in an end-to-end offline manner. Specifically, the proposed DSNet
compresses multi-level convolutional features to uniform spatial resolution
features. The learned MSC features effectively encode both appearance and
semantic information of objects in the same-resolution feature maps, thus
enabling an elegant combination of the MSC features with any DCF-based methods.
Additionally, a channel reliability measurement (CRM) method is presented to
further refine the learned MSC features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
the MSC features learned from the proposed DSNet on two DCF tracking
frameworks: the basic DCF framework and the continuous convolution operator
framework. Extensive experiments show that the learned MSC features have the
appealing advantage of allowing the equipped DCF-based tracking methods to
perform favorably against the state-of-the-art methods while running at high
frame rates.

observable semantics of parallel composition in the {\pi}-calculus, by
conservatively extending linear logic to hyperenvironments (collections of
environments, inspired by the hypersequents by Avron [1991]). Separation of
environments in hyperenvironments is internalised by $\otimes$ and corresponds
to parallel process behaviour. Thanks to this property, for the first time we
are able to extract a labelled transition system (lts) semantics from proof
rewritings. Leveraging the information on parallelism at the level of types, we
obtain a logical reconstruction of the delayed actions that Merro and Sangiorgi
[2004] formulated to model non-blocking I/O in the {\pi}-calculus. We define a
denotational semantics for processes based on Brzozowski derivatives, and
uncover that non-interference in HCP corresponds to Fubini's theorem of double
antiderivation. Having an lts allows us to validate HCP using the standard
toolbox of behavioural theory. We instantiate bisimilarity and barbed
congruence for HCP, and obtain a full abstraction result: bisimilarity,
denotational equivalence, and barbed congruence coincide.

can be used to estimate blood pressure (BP) by extracting various features, the
changes in morphological contours of both PPG and ECG signals due to various
diseases of circulatory system and interaction of other physiological systems
make the extraction of such features very difficult. Methods: In this work, we
propose a waveform-based hierarchical Artificial Neural Network - Long Short
Term Memory (ANN-LSTM) model for BP estimation. The model consists of two
hierarchy levels, where the lower hierarchy level uses ANNs to extract
necessary morphological features from ECG and PPG waveforms and the upper
hierarchy level uses LSTM layers to account for the time domain variation of
the features extracted by lower hierarchy level. Results: The proposed model is
evaluated on 39 subjects using the Association for the Advancement of Medical
Instrumentations (AAMI) standard and the British Hypertension Society (BHS)
standard. The method satisfies both the standards in the estimation of systolic
blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). For the proposed
network, the mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE)
for SBP estimation are 1.10 and 1.56 mmHg, respectively, and for DBP estimation
are 0.58 and 0.85 mmHg, respectively. Conclusion: The performance of the
proposed hierarchical ANN-LSTM model is found to be better than the other
feature engineering-based networks. It is shown that the proposed model is able
to automatically extract the necessary features and their time domain
variations to estimate BP reliably in a noninvasive continuous manner.
Significance: The method is expected to greatly facilitate the presently
available mobile health-care gadgets in continuous BP estimation.

sequence of smooth closed manifolds $\{M_{k}\}^{\infty}_{k=1}$ such that
$M_{k}\hookrightarrow M_{k+1}$ is a submanifold and a retract of $M_{k+1}$ for
any $k\geq 1$ and there exists a nontrivial Massey product

Point-based Distance Metric Learning (PDML) in this paper. PDML does not
require dense annotated masks and only leverages several labeled points that
are much easier to obtain to guide the training process. Concretely, we
leverage semantic relationship among the annotated points by encouraging the
feature representations of the intra- and inter-category points to keep
consistent, i.e. points within the same category should have more similar
feature representations compared to those from different categories. We
formulate such a characteristic into a simple distance metric loss, which
collaborates with the point-wise cross-entropy loss to optimize the deep neural
networks. Furthermore, to fully exploit the limited annotations, distance
metric learning is conducted across different training images instead of simply
adopting an image-dependent manner. We conduct extensive experiments on two
challenging scene parsing benchmarks of PASCAL-Context and ADE 20K to validate
the effectiveness of our PDML, and competitive mIoU scores are achieved.

optical access to their coherently controllable electron spin systems, leading
to spin-photon quantum devices and nanoscale sensing of various physical
parameters. However, the NV spin coherence time (T2) in NDs has been limited to
one or two orders of magnitude shorter than those in bulk diamonds owing to the
complicated surface effect that decoheres the NV spin systems. Here, we study
the relation between the surface properties and T2 of single NV centers in NDs
by systematically analyzing the effect of surface oxidation. We apply aerobic
and acidic oxidation methods with various heating temperatures and processing
times and find that aerobic oxidation most effectively oxidizes the surface and
extends T2 by a factor of 1.6 to the original NDs. The ND-size dependence of T2
clearly shows that the surface oxidation removes a constant decoherence
contribution irrespective of the ND size and that a new surface derived
decoherence source emerges when the ND size reduces below 50 nm. The present
results provide quantitative information on the decoherence sources of NV spin
systems of NDs and will enable a strategic surface modification for better spin
manipulations of NV centers in the context of quantum information science and

particles back in time, we find that on average 95\% of the bulge stars formed

only 2\% formed {\it ex situ} in external galaxies. The evolution of the AM
distribution of the bulge stars paints an interesting picture: the higher the
final $B/T$ ratio, the more the specific AM remains preserved during the bulge
formation. In all cases, bulge stars migrate significantly towards the central
region, reducing their average galactocentric radius by roughly a factor 2,
independently of the final $B/T$ value. However, in the higher $B/T$
($\gtrsim0.2$) objects, the velocity of the bulge stars increases and the AM of
the bulge is almost conserved, whereas at lower $B/T$ values, the velocity of
the bulge stars decreases and the AM of bulge reduces. The correlation between
the evolution of the AM and $B/T$ suggests that bulge and disc formation are
closely linked and cannot be treated as independent processes.

material, and to reproducibly fabricate dielectric filled cavities. Also
presented are two versions with improved capabilities. The first, called a
dual-mode cavity, is designed to support two modes simultaneously. The second

magnetic field strength of 2.84 $\pm$ 0.07 mT was generated at an input power

(NWP) models, consisting of a set of differential equations describing the

deterministic forecasts of future atmospheric states. To assess uncertainty in
NWP forecasts so-called forecast ensembles are utilized. They are generated by
employing a NWP model for distinct variants. However, as forecast ensembles are
not able to capture the full amount of uncertainty in an NWP model, they often
exhibit biases and dispersion errors. Therefore it has become common practise
to employ statistical post processing models which correct for biases and
improve calibration. We propose a novel post processing approach based on
D-vine copulas, representing the predictive distribution by its quantiles.
These models allow for much more general dependence structures than the
state-of-the-art EMOS model and is highly data adapted. Our D-vine quantile
regression approach shows excellent predictive performance in comparative
studies of temperature forecasts over Europe with different forecast horizons

Forecasting (ECMWF). Specifically for larger forecast horizons the method
clearly improves over the benchmark EMOS model.

the VISTA Variables in the V\'ia L\'actea (VVV) ESO Public Survey. Our analysis
is based on VVV variability, multicolor, and proper motion (PM) data.
Complementary data from the VVV eXtended survey (VVVX) as well as archive data
and spectroscopic follow-up observations aided in the analysis and
interpretation of VVV-WIT-07. A search for periodicity in the VVV Ks-band light
curve of VVV-WIT-07 results in two tentative periods at P~322 days and P~170
days. Colors and PM are consistent either with a reddened MS star or a pre-MS
star in the foreground disk. The near-IR spectra of VVV-WIT-07 appear
featureless, having no prominent lines in emission or absorption. Features
found in the light curve of VVV-WIT-07 are similar to those seen in J1407

alternatively, to KIC 8462852 (Boyajian's star), an F3 IV/V star showing
irregular and aperiodic dips in its light curve. Alternative scenarios, none of
which is fully consistent with the available data, are also briefly discussed,
including a young stellar object, a T Tauri star surrounded by clumpy dust
structure, a main sequence star eclipsed by a nearby extended object, a

long and require substantial computation time due to a number of constraints
and requirements, sometimes hampering clinical use. However, the pulses offer
opportunities of reduced-FOV imaging, regional flip-angle homogenization, and
localized spectroscopy, e.g., of hyperpolarized metabolites. We propose a novel
deep learning approach to ultra-fast design multi-dimensional RF pulses with
intention of real-time pulse updates. Methods: The proposed neural network
considers input maps of the desired excitation region of interest, and outputs
a multi-dimensional RF pulse. The training library is retrieved from a large
image database, and the target RF pulses trained upon are calculated with a
method of choice. Results: A relatively simple neural network is enough to
produce reliable 2D spatial-selective RF pulses of comparable performance to
the teaching method. For binary regions of interest, the training library does
not need to be vast, hence, re-establishment of the training library is not
necessarily cumbersome. The predicted, single-channel pulses were tested
numerically and experimentally at 3 T. Conclusion: We demonstrate a relatively
effortless training of multi-dimensional RF pulses, based on non-MRI related
inputs, but working in an MRI setting still. The prediction time of few
milliseconds renders real-time updates of advanced RF pulses possible.

bands of semiconductors are commonly approximated as parabolic around their

complexity of real materials. In this work, we use density functional theory to
assess the impact of band non-parabolicity on four common thin-film
photovoltaic materials - GaAs, CdTe, Cu$_2$ZnSnS$_4$ and CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ -
at temperatures and carrier densities relevant for real-world applications.
First, we calculate the effective mass at the band edges. We compare
finite-difference, unweighted least-squares and thermally weighted
least-squares approaches. We find that the thermally weighted least-squares
method reduces sensitivity to the choice of sampling density. Second, we employ
a Kane quasi-linear dispersion to quantify the extent of non-parabolicity, and
compare results from different electronic structure theories to consider the
effect of spin-orbit coupling and electron exchange. Finally, we focus on the
halide perovskite CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ as a model system to assess the impact of
non-parabolicity on calculated electron transport and optical properties at
high carrier concentrations. We find that at a concentration of 10$^{20}$

low carrier-concentration value, and the polaron mobility decreases by a factor
of three. Our work suggests that similar adjustments should be made to the

  Presence of Missing Variables",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Classification, the process of assigning a label (or class) to an observation
given its features, is a common task in many applications. Nonetheless in most
real-life applications, the labels can not be fully explained by the observed
features. Indeed there can be many factors hidden to the modellers. The
unexplained variation is then treated as some random noise which is handled
differently depending on the method retained by the practitioner. This work
focuses on two simple and widely used supervised classification algorithms:
discrete choice models and artificial neural networks in the context of binary
classification.
  Through various numerical experiments involving continuous or discrete
explanatory features, we present a comparison of the retained methods'
performance in presence of missing variables. The impact of the distribution of
the two classes in the training data is also investigated. The outcomes of
those experiments highlight the fact that artificial neural networks
outperforms the discrete choice models, except when the distribution of the
classes in the training data is highly unbalanced.
  Finally, this work provides some guidelines for choosing the right classifier
with respect to the training data.

simulation that reaches the energies 4.3-4.5 GeV where pentaquarks reside.
Several decay channels are open in this energy region and we explore the fate
of $P_c$ in the one-channel approximation in this work. Energies of eigenstates
are extracted for the nucleon-charmonium system at zero total momentum for all
quantum numbers, i.e. six lattice irreducible representations. No significant
energy shifts are observed. The number of the observed lattice eigenstates
agrees with the number expected for non-interacting charmonium and nucleon.
Thus, we do not find any strong indication for a resonance or a bound state in
these exotic channels within one-channel approximation. This possibly indicates
that the coupling of $NJ/\psi $ channel with other two-hadron channels might be
responsible for $P_c$ resonances in experiment. One of the challenges of this
study is that up to six degenerate $J/\psi(p) N(-p)$ eigenstates are expected
in the non-interacting limit due non-zero spins of $J/\psi$ and N, and we
establish all of them in the spectra.

cells (RBCs) in a wall-bounded shear flow. The flow is assumed as almost
inertialess. The suspension of RBCs, modeled as biconcave capsules whose
membrane follows the Skalak constitutive law, is simulated for a wide range of
viscosity ratios between the cytoplasm and plasma: $\lambda$ = 0.1-10, for
volume fractions up to $\phi$ = 0.41 and for different capillary numbers
($Ca$). Our numerical results show that an RBC at low $Ca$ tends to orient to
the shear plane and exhibits the so-called rolling motion, a stable mode with
higher intrinsic viscosity than the so-called tumbling motion. As $Ca$
increases, the mode shifts from the rolling to the swinging motion.
Hydrodynamic interactions (higher volume fraction) also allows RBCs to exhibit
both tumbling or swinging motions resulting in a drop of the intrinsic
viscosity for dilute and semi-dilute suspensions. Because of this mode change,
conventional ways of modeling the relative viscosity as a polynomial function
of $\phi$ cannot be simply applied in suspensions of RBCs at low volume
fractions. The relative viscosity for high volume fractions, however, can be
well described as a function of an effective volume fraction, defined by the
volume of spheres of radius equal to the semi-middle axis of the deformed RBC.
We find that the relative viscosity successfully collapses on a single
non-linear curve independently of $\lambda$ except for the case with $Ca \geq$
0.4, where the fit works only in the case of low/moderate volume fraction, and
fails in the case of a fully dense suspension.

performance on many visual tasks. Recently, they became useful models for the
visual system in neuroscience. However, it is still not clear what are learned
by CNNs in terms of neuronal circuits. When a deep CNN with many layers is used
for the visual system, it is not easy to compare the structure components of
CNNs with possible neuroscience underpinnings due to highly complex circuits
from the retina to higher visual cortex. Here we address this issue by focusing
on single retinal ganglion cells with biophysical models and recording data
from animals. By training CNNs with white noise images to predict neuronal
responses, we found that fine structures of the retinal receptive field can be
revealed. Specifically, convolutional filters learned are resembling biological
components of the retinal circuit. This suggests that a CNN learning from one
single retinal cell reveals a minimal neural network carried out in this cell.
Furthermore, when CNNs learned from different cells are transferred between
cells, there is a diversity of transfer learning performance, which indicates
that CNNs are cell-specific. Moreover, when CNNs are transferred between
different types of input images, here white noise v.s. natural images, transfer
learning shows a good performance, which implies that CNNs indeed capture the
full computational ability of a single retinal cell for different inputs. Taken
together, these results suggest that CNNs could be used to reveal structure
components of neuronal circuits, and provide a powerful model for neural system
identification.

$\approx$10\% of BH mergers are able to consist of two BHs with spins close to
one (high spin + high spin), predecessors of such binaries could be sources of
two gamma ray bursts. The BH with the spin close to one could be formed as the

special cases. The Pauli-Gursey transformation mixes particles and

P and CP symmetries at each Pauli frame specified by a generalized Pauli-Gursey

are then naturally defined by a suitable choice of the Pauli frame, where only
Dirac-type fermions appear with well-defined C, P and CP, and thus the C
symmetry for Majorana neutrinos agrees with the C symmetry for Dirac-type
fermions. This fully symmetric setting corresponds to the idea of Majorana
neutrinos as Bogoliubov quasi-particles. In contrast, the conventional direct
construction of Majorana neutrinos in the seesaw model, where CP is
well-defined but C and P are violated, encounters the mismatch of C symmetry
for Majorana neutrinos and C symmetry for chiral fermions; this mismatch is
recognized as the inevitable appearance of the singlet (trivial) representation

unboxing is not always possible due to a subtle assumption about the runtime
representation of OCaml values. The current correctness check is incomplete,
rejecting many valid definitions, in particular those involving
mutually-recursive datatype declarations.
  In this paper, we explain the notion of separability as a semantic for the
unboxing criterion, and propose a set of inference rules to check separability.
From these inference rules, we derive a new implementation of the unboxing
check that properly supports mutually-recursive definitions.

and vanishes along any field line where the original field matches the

potential on the boundary. We propose a particular `minimal' gauge that depends
only on the reference field and minimises this boundary contribution, so as to
reveal topological information about the original magnetic field. We illustrate
the effect of different gauge choices using the Low-Lou and Titov-Demoulin

along with a spatial kernel for edge-preserving smoothing. We consider a
generalization of this filter, the so-called adaptive bilateral filter, where
the center and width of the Gaussian range kernel is allowed to change from
pixel to pixel. Though this variant was originally proposed for sharpening and
noise removal, it can also be used for other applications such as artifact
removal and texture filtering. Similar to the bilateral filter, the brute-force
implementation of its adaptive counterpart requires intense computations. While
several fast algorithms have been proposed in the literature for bilateral
filtering, most of them work only with a fixed range kernel. In this paper, we
propose a fast algorithm for adaptive bilateral filtering, whose complexity
does not scale with the spatial filter width. This is based on the observation
that the concerned filtering can be performed purely in range space using an
appropriately defined local histogram. We show that by replacing the histogram
with a polynomial and the finite range-space sum with an integral, we can
approximate the filter using analytic functions. In particular, an efficient
algorithm is derived using the following innovations: the polynomial is fitted
by matching its moments to those of the target histogram (this is done using
fast convolutions), and the analytic functions are recursively computed using
integration-by-parts. Our algorithm can accelerate the brute-force
implementation by at least $20 \times$, without perceptible distortions in the
visual quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm for
sharpening, JPEG deblocking, and texture filtering.

social network analysis. In recent years, simultaneous considering of nodes'
attributes and topological structures of social networks in the process of
community detection has attracted the attentions of many scholars, and this
consideration has been recently used in some community detection methods to
increase their efficiencies and to enhance their performances in finding
meaningful and relevant communities. But the problem is that most of these
methods tend to find non-overlapping communities, while many real-world
networks include communities that often overlap to some extent. In order to
solve this problem, an evolutionary algorithm called MOBBO-OCD, which is based
on multi-objective biogeography-based optimization (BBO), is proposed in this
paper to automatically find overlapping communities in a social network with
node attributes with synchronously considering the density of connections and
the similarity of nodes' attributes in the network. In MOBBO-OCD, an extended
locus-based adjacency representation called OLAR is introduced to encode and
decode overlapping communities. Based on OLAR, a rank-based migration operator
along with a novel two-phase mutation strategy and a new double-point crossover
are used in the evolution process of MOBBO-OCD to effectively lead the
population into the evolution path. In order to assess the performance of
MOBBO-OCD, a new metric called alpha_SAEM is proposed in this paper, which is
able to evaluate the goodness of both overlapping and non-overlapping
partitions with considering the two aspects of node attributes and linkage
structure. Quantitative evaluations reveal that MOBBO-OCD achieves favorable
results which are quite superior to the results of 15 relevant community
detection algorithms in the literature.

collected, such as various types of omics data and medical imaging modalities.
Applying multi-view learning to these different sources of information can
increase the accuracy of medical classification models compared with
single-view procedures. However, collecting biomedical data can be expensive
and/or burdening for patients, so that it is important to reduce the amount of
required data collection. It is therefore necessary to develop multi-view
learning methods which can accurately identify those views that are most
important for prediction. In recent years, several biomedical studies have used
an approach known as multi-view stacking (MVS), where a model is trained on
each view separately and the resulting predictions are combined through
stacking. In these studies, MVS has been shown to increase classification
accuracy. However, the MVS framework can also be used for selecting a subset of
important views. To study the view selection potential of MVS, we develop a
special case called stacked penalized logistic regression (StaPLR). Compared
with existing view-selection methods, StaPLR can make use of faster
optimization algorithms and is easily parallelized. We show that nonnegativity
constraints on the parameters of the function which combines the views play an
important role in preventing unimportant views from entering the model. We
investigate the performance of StaPLR through simulations, and consider two
real data examples. We compare the performance of StaPLR with an existing view
selection method called the group lasso and observe that, in terms of view
selection, StaPLR is often more conservative and has a consistently lower false
positive rate.

hyperparameter configurations. Bayesian optimization is a powerful framework
for optimizing the hyperparameters of DNNs. These methods need sufficient
evaluation data to approximate and minimize the validation error function of
hyperparameters. However, the expensive evaluation cost of DNNs leads to very
few evaluation data within a limited time, which greatly reduces the efficiency
of Bayesian optimization. Besides, the previous researches focus on using the
complete evaluation data to conduct Bayesian optimization, and ignore the
intermediate evaluation data generated by early stopping methods. To alleviate
the insufficient evaluation data problem, we propose a fast hyperparameter
optimization method, HOIST, that utilizes both the complete and intermediate
evaluation data to accelerate the hyperparameter optimization of DNNs.
Specifically, we train multiple basic surrogates to gather information from the
mixed evaluation data, and then combine all basic surrogates using weighted
bagging to provide an accurate ensemble surrogate. Our empirical studies show
that HOIST outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on a wide range of DNNs,
including feed forward neural networks, convolutional neural networks,
recurrent neural networks, and variational autoencoder.

compositions of planets via measurements of their masses and radii. With future
sample sizes of hundreds of planets to come from TESS and PLATO, we develop a
statistical method that can flexibly yet robustly characterize these

relation has been explored in many prior works, they mostly use a power-law
model, with assumptions that are not flexible enough to capture important
features in current and future M-R diagrams. To address these shortcomings, a
nonparametric approach is developed using a sequence of Bernstein polynomials.
We demonstrate the benefit of taking the nonparametric approach by benchmarking
our findings with previous work and showing that a power-law can only
reasonably describe the M-R relation of the smallest planets and that the
intrinsic scatter can change non-monotonically with different values of a
radius. We then apply this method to a larger dataset, consisting of all the
Kepler observations in the NASA Exoplanet Archive. Our nonparametric approach
provides a tool to estimate the M-R relation by incorporating heteroskedastic
measurement errors into the model. As more observations will be obtained in the
near future, this approach can be used with the provided R code to analyze a
larger dataset for a better understanding of the M-R relation.

studies with animals or neonatales, thresholds have to be derived from neural

measures, the standard approach is still the subjective setting of the
threshold to the value where at least a ""clear"" neuronal signal is detectable.
These measures are highly subjective, strongly depend on the noise, and
fluctuate due to the low signal-to-noise ratio near the threshold. Here we show
a novel method to reliably estimate physiological thresholds based on
neurophysiological parameters. Using surrogate data, we demonstrate that
fitting the responses to different stimulus intensities with a hard sigmoid
function, in combination with subsampling, provides a robust threshold value as
well as an accurate uncertainty estimate. This method has no systematic

featuring bound states in the bandgap (I) or additional, non-discrete band
states (II). Microscopic material parameters for class I alloys can directly be
extracted from photoluminescence (PL) spectra, whereas any conclusions drawn
for class II alloys usually remain indirect and limited to macroscopic
assertions. Nonetheless, here, we present a spectroscopic study on exciton
localization in a so-called mixed crystal alloy (class II) that allows us to
access microscopic alloy parameters. We study bulk In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N epilayers
at the onset of alloy formation (0 $\leq$ $x$ $\leq$ 2.4%) in order to
understand the material's particular robustness to defects. Based on an
in-depth PL analysis it is demonstrated how different excitonic complexes
(free, bound, and complex bound excitons) can serve as a probe to monitor the
dilute limit of class II alloys. From an $x$-dependent linewidth analysis we
extract the length scales at which excitons become increasingly localized,
meaning that they convert from a free to a bound particle upon alloy formation.
Already at x = 2.4% the average exciton diffusion length is reduced to 5.7
$\pm$ 1.3 nm at a temperature of 12 K, thus, detrimental exciton transfer
mechanisms towards non-radiative defects are suppressed. In addition, the
associated low temperature PL data suggests that a single indium atom does not
suffice in order to permanently capture an exciton. Micro-PL spectra even give
access to a forthright probing of silicon bound excitons embedded in a
particular environment of indium atoms, thanks to the emergence of a hierarchy
of individual, energetically sharp emission lines (full width at half maximum
$\approx$ 300 $\mu$eV). Consequently, the present study allows us to extract
first microscopic alloy properties formerly only accessible for class I alloys.

days after the peak of the superoutburst, interpreted it as a bow--shock formed
by a quasi-continuous outflow from the source in quiescence. The head of the
bow--shock is coincident with the high--proper motion vector of the source
($v_{\perp}=123\pm5$ km s$^{-1}$) at a distance of $d=202\pm7$ pc. The object
was detected as a weak X-ray source ($0.015\pm0.002$ counts s$^{-1}$) in the
plateau of the superoutburst, and its flux lowered by two times in quiescence
(0.007$\pm$0.002 counts s$^{-1}$). Spectroscopic observations in quiescence we
confirmed the orbital period value $P_{\rm{orb}}=0.0545\pm 0.0026$ days,
consistent with early-superhump estimates, and the following orbital
parameters: $\gamma= -21\pm3$ km s$^{-1}$ and $K_1 = 53\pm3$ km s$^{-1}$. The
white dwarf is revealed as the system approaches quiescence, which enables us
to infer the effective temperature of the primary $T_{eff}=11,600\pm400$K. The

from the Planetary Nebula Spectrograph (PN.S), counter-dispersed imaging, and

transition between inner regions and halos. Slow rotators have increased
rotational support at large radii. Most of the ePN.S fast rotators show a
decrease in rotation, due to the fading of the stellar disk in the outer, more
slowly rotating spheroid. 30% of these fast rotators are dominated by rotation
also at large radii, 40% show kinematic twists or misalignments, indicating a
transition from oblate to triaxial in the halo. Despite this variety of
kinematic behaviors, the ePN.S ETG halos have similar angular momentum content,
independently of fast/slow rotation of the central regions. Estimated kinematic
transition radii in units of Re are ~1-3 Re and anti-correlate with stellar

to be a promising modality in affective computing. Recently, deep learning

small-local areas on face and limited size of available databases still
constrain the recognition accuracy on such emotional facial behavior. In this
work, to tackle such challenges, we propose a novel attention mechanism called
micro-attention cooperating with residual network. Micro-attention enables the
network to learn to focus on facial areas of interest covering different action
units. Moreover, coping with small datasets, the micro-attention is designed
without adding noticeable parameters while a simple yet efficient transfer
learning approach is together utilized to alleviate the overfitting risk. With
extensive experimental evaluations on three benchmarks (CASMEII, SAMM and SMIC)

approximating the data (using quantization) or the filter kernel (via analytic
expansions), we locally approximate the kernel using weighted and shifted

The algorithm emerging from the proposed approximation essentially involves
clustering and fast convolutions, and is easy to implement. Moreover, a variant
of our algorithm comes with a guarantee (bound) on the approximation error,
which is not enjoyed by existing algorithms. We present some results for
high-dimensional bilateral and nonlocal means filtering to demonstrate the

applications sharing an enterprise network is still an unresolved problem. The
main challenges are: (i) How to define user- and application-aware shares of
resources? (ii) How to determine an allocation of shares of network resources
to applications? (iii) How to allocate the shares per application in
heterogeneous networks at scale? In this paper we propose solutions to the
three challenges and introduce a system design for enterprise deployment.
Defining the necessary resource shares per application is hard, as the intended
use case and user's preferences influence the resource demand. Utility
functions based on user experience enable a mapping of network resources in
terms of throughput and latency budget to a common user-level utility scale. A
multi-objective MILP is formulated to solve the throughput- and delay-aware
embedding of each utility function for a max-min fairness criteria. The
allocation of resources in traditional networks with policing and scheduling
cannot distinguish large numbers of classes. We propose a resource allocation
system design for enterprise networks based on Software-Defined Networking
principles to achieve delay-constrained routing in the network and application
pacing at the end-hosts. The system design is evaluated against best effort
networks with applications competing for the throughput of a constrained link.
The competing applications belong to the five application classes web browsing,
file download, remote terminal work, video streaming, and Voice-over-IP. The
results show that the proposed methodology improves the minimum and total
utility, minimizes packet loss and queuing delay at bottlenecks, establishes
fairness in terms of utility between applications, and achieves predictable
application performance at high link utilization.

an interesting nontrivial defect CFT. We compute its bulk-defect structure

The results at strong coupling are found to be in precise agreement with the
holographic calculation based on perturbation theory around the AdS$_2$ string
worldsheet, where they correspond to correlation functions of open string
fluctuations and closed string vertex operators inserted on the worldsheet.
Along the way, we clarify several aspects of the Gram-Schmidt analysis which
were not addressed in the previous paper. In particular, we clarify the role
played by the multi-trace operators at the non-planar level, and confirm its
importance by computing the non-planar correction to the defect two-point
function. We also provide a formula for the first non-planar correction to the
defect correlators in terms of the Quantum Spectral Curve, which suggests the
potential applicability of the formalism to the non-planar correlation

powerful technique to constrain cosmological parameters, in particular dark
energy. The Dark Energy Survey has measured 207 spectroscopically--confirmed
Type Ia supernova lightcurves; the baryon acoustic oscillation feature; weak
gravitational lensing; and galaxy clustering. Here we present combined results
from these probes, deriving constraints on the equation of state, $w$, of dark
energy and its energy density in the Universe. Independently of other
experiments, such as those that measure the cosmic microwave background, the
probes from this single photometric survey rule out a Universe with no dark
energy, finding $w=-0.80^{+0.09}_{-0.11}$. The geometry is shown to be
consistent with a spatially flat Universe, and we obtain a constraint on the
baryon density of $\Omega_b=0.069^{+0.009}_{-0.012}$ that is independent of
early Universe measurements. These results demonstrate the potential power of
large multi-probe photometric surveys and pave the way for order of magnitude
advances in our constraints on properties of dark energy and cosmology over the
next decade.

'inverse distance ladder' method, which adds the information from 207 Type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) at redshift 0.018 < z <

traditional measurements of H_0 with SNe Ia use a distance ladder of parallax
and Cepheid variable stars, the inverse distance ladder relies on absolute
distance measurements from the BAOs to calibrate the intrinsic magnitude of the
SNe Ia. We find H_0 = 67.8 +/- 1.3 km s-1 Mpc-1 (statistical and systematic
uncertainties, 68% confidence). Our measurement makes minimal assumptions about
the underlying cosmological model, and our analysis was blinded to reduce
confirmation bias. We examine possible systematic uncertainties and all are
below the statistical uncertainties. Our H_0 value is consistent with estimates
derived from the Cosmic Microwave Background assuming a LCDM universe (Planck

parameters from 207 spectroscopically classified type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia)
from the first three years of the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program

sample with an external sample of 122 low-redshift ($z$<0.1) SNe Ia, resulting
in a ""DES-SN3YR"" sample of 329 SNe Ia. Our cosmological analyses are blinded:
after combining our DES-SN3YR distances with constraints from the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB; Planck Collaboration 2016), our uncertainties in the
measurement of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, $w$, are .042
(stat) and .059 (stat+syst) at 68% confidence. We provide a detailed systematic
uncertainty budget, which has nearly equal contributions from photometric
calibration, astrophysical bias corrections, and instrumental bias corrections.
We also include several new sources of systematic uncertainty. While our sample
is <1/3 the size of the Pantheon sample, our constraints on $w$ are only larger
by 1.4$\times$, showing the impact of the DES SN Ia light curve quality. We
find that the traditional stretch and color standardization parameters of the
DES SNe Ia are in agreement with earlier SN Ia samples such as Pan-STARRS1 and
the Supernova Legacy Survey. However, we find smaller intrinsic scatter about
the Hubble diagram (0.077 mag). Interestingly, we find no evidence for a Hubble
residual step ( 0.007 $\pm$ 0.018 mag) as a function of host galaxy mass for
the DES subset, in 2.4$\sigma$ tension with previous measurements. We also
present novel validation methods of our sample using simulated SNe Ia inserted
in DECam images and using large catalog-level simulations to test for biases in
our analysis pipelines.

Supernova Project (CSP). These simulations are used to model biases from
selection effects and light curve analysis, and to determine bias corrections
for SN~Ia distance moduli that are used to measure cosmological parameters. To
generate realistic light curves, the simulation uses a detailed SN~Ia model,
incorporates information from observations (PSF, sky noise, zero point), and
uses summary information (e.g., detection efficiency vs. signal to noise ratio)
based on 10,000 fake SN light curves whose fluxes were overlaid on images and
processed with our analysis pipelines. The quality of the simulation is
illustrated by predicting distributions observed in the data. Averaging within

ranges of the low-z and DES-SN samples. For individual events, particularly
those with extreme red or blue color, distance biases can reach 0.4~mag.

recent analyses using type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) to measure cosmological
parameters. To improve the calibration, we present the application of Spectral
Energy Distribution (SED)-dependent ""chromatic corrections"" to the supernova
light-curve photometry from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). These corrections
depend on the combined atmospheric and instrumental transmission function for
each exposure, and they affect photometry at the 0.01 mag (1%) level,
comparable to systematic uncertainties in calibration and photometry. Fitting
our combined DES and low-z SN Ia sample with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO)
and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) priors for the cosmological parameters
$\Omega_{\rm m}$ (the fraction of the critical density of the universe
comprised of matter) and w (the dark energy equation of state parameter), we
compare those parameters before and after applying the corrections. We find the
change in w and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ due to not including chromatic corrections are
-0.002 and 0.000, respectively, for the DES-SN3YR sample with BAO and CMB
priors, consistent with a larger DES-SN3YR-like simulation, which has a
w-change of 0.0005 with an uncertainty of 0.008 and an $\Omega_{\rm m}$ change
of 0.000 with an uncertainty of 0.002 . However, when considering samples on

distance modulus) for supernova distances.

systematic uncertainties. Selection effects are characterised using Monte-Carlo
simulations. We demonstrate its implementation by fitting realisations of SNIa
datasets where the SNIa model closely follows that used in Steve. Next, we
validate on more realistic SNANA simulations of SNIa samples from the Dark
Energy Survey and low-redshift surveys. These simulated datasets contain more
than $60\,000$ SNeIa, which we use to evaluate biases in the recovery of
cosmological parameters, specifically the equation-of-state of dark energy,
$w$. This is the most rigorous test of a BHM method applied to SNIa cosmology
fitting, and reveals small $w$-biases that depend on the simulated SNIa
properties, in particular the intrinsic SNIa scatter model. This $w$-bias is
less than $0.03$ on average, less than half the statistical uncertainty on
$w$.These simulation test results are a concern for BHM cosmology fitting
applications on large upcoming surveys, and therefore future development will
focus on minimising the sensitivity of Steve to the SNIa intrinsic scatter
model.

  Second major revision of 6 August 2018 still under review",,,,"q-fin.PM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Energy markets are strategic to governments and economic development. Several
commodities compete as substitutable energy sources and energy diversifiers.
Such competition reduces the energy vulnerability of countries as well as
portfolios' risk exposure. Vulnerability results mainly from price trends and
fluctuations, following supply and demand shocks. Such energy price uncertainty
attracts many market participants in the energy commodity markets. First,
energy producers and consumers hedge adverse price changes with energy
derivatives. Second, financial market participants use commodities and
commodity derivatives to diversify their conventional portfolios. For that
reason, we consider the joint dependence between the United States (U.S.)
natural gas, crude oil and stock markets. We use Gatfaoui's (2015) time varying
multivariate copula analysis and related variance regimes. Such approach
handles structural changes in asset prices. In this light, we draw implications
for portfolio optimization, when investors diversify their stock portfolios
with natural gas and crude oil assets. We minimize the portfolio's variance,
semi-variance and tail risk, in the presence and the absence of constraints on
the portfolio's expected return and/or U.S. stock investment. The return
constraint reduces the performance of the optimal portfolio. Moreover, the
regime-specific portfolio optimization helps implement an enhanced active
management strategy over the whole sample period. Under a return constraint,
the semi-variance optimal portfolio offers the best risk-return tradeoff,
whereas the tail-risk optimal portfolio offers the best tradeoff in the absence
of a return constraint.

which are measured by the weighted pairwise distances of class means and
meanwhile minimize the within-class scatters under the L1-norm and L2-norm,
respectively. The proposed models can avoid the small sample size (SSS) problem
and have no rank limit that may encounter in LDA. It is worth mentioning that,
the employment of L1-norm gives a robust performance of L1BLDA, and L1BLDA is
solved through an effective non-greedy alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM), where all the projection vectors can be obtained once for
all. In addition, the weighting constants of L1BLDA and L2BLDA between the
between-class and within-class terms are determined by the involved data set,
which makes our L1BLDA and L2BLDA adaptive. The experimental results on both
benchmark data sets as well as the handwritten digit databases demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed methods.

of applications important to e-commerce, online advertising and internet

classification, in-shop and cross-domain retrieval which eliminates the
requirement of rich annotations like bounding boxes and human-joints or
clothing landmarks, and training of bounding box/ key-landmark detector for the
same. Factors such as subtle appearance differences, variations in human poses,
different shooting angles, apparel deformations, and self-occlusion add to the
challenges in classification and retrieval of apparel items. Cross-domain
retrieval is even harder due to the presence of large variation between online
shopping images, usually taken in ideal lighting, pose, positive angle and
clean background as compared with street photos captured by users in
complicated conditions with poor lighting and cluttered scenes. Our framework
uses compact bilinear CNN with tensor sketch algorithm to generate embeddings
that capture local pairwise feature interactions in a translationally invariant
manner. For apparel classification, we pass the feature embeddings through a
softmax classifier, while, the in-shop and cross-domain retrieval pipelines use
a triplet-loss based optimization approach, such that squared Euclidean
distance between embeddings measures the dissimilarity between the images.
Unlike previous works that relied on bounding box, key clothing landmarks or
human joint detectors to assist the final deep classifier, proposed framework
can be trained directly on the provided category labels or generated triplets
for triplet loss optimization. Lastly, Experimental results on the DeepFashion

coding in the presence of wiretappers, who can access one arbitrary edge subset
up to a certain size, also referred to as the security level. Secure network
coding is applied to prevent the leakage of the source information to the
wiretappers. In this two-part paper, we consider the problem of secure network
coding when the information rate and the security level can change over time.
In the current paper (i.e., Part I of the two-part paper), we focus on the
problem for a fixed security level and a flexible rate. To efficiently solve
this problem, we put forward local-encoding-preserving secure network coding,
where a family of secure linear network codes (SLNCs) is called
local-encoding-preserving if all the SLNCs in this family share a common local
encoding kernel at each intermediate node in the network. We present an
efficient approach for constructing upon an SLNC that exists a
local-encoding-preserving SLNC with the same security level and the rate
reduced by one. By applying this approach repeatedly, we can obtain a family of
local-encoding-preserving SLNCs with a fixed security level and multiple rates.
We also develop a polynomial-time algorithm for efficient implementation of
this approach. Furthermore, it is proved that the proposed approach incurs no
penalty on the required field size for the existence of SLNCs in terms of the
best known lower bound by Guang and Yeung. The result in this paper will be
used as a building block for efficiently constructing a family of
local-encoding-preserving SLNCs for all possible pairs of rate and security
level, which will be discussed in the companion paper (i.e., Part II of the

description of a series of processes, starting from the solar flare associated
electron beam exciting Langmuir and ion-acoustic turbulence, and subsequent
partial conversion of beam energy into the radiation energy by nonlinear
processes. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation is rigorous but the method is
computationally intense, and it is difficult to diagnose the results. Numerical
solution of equations of weak turbulence (WT) theory, termed WT simulation, on
the other hand, is efficient and naturally lends itself to diagnostics since
various terms in the equation can be turned on or off. Nevertheless, WT theory
is based upon a number of assumptions. It is, therefore, desirable to compare
the two methods, which is carried out for the first time in the present paper
with numerical solutions of the complete set of equations of the WT theory and
with two-dimensional electromagnetic PIC simulation. Upon making quantitative
comparisons it is found that WT theory is largely valid, although some
discrepancies are also found. The present study also indicates that it requires
large computational resources in order to accurately simulate the radiation
emission processes, especially for low electron beam speeds. Findings from the
present paper thus imply that both methods may be useful for the study of solar
radio emissions as they are complementary.

become tougher than the demand. Low power devices have emerged
tremendously.Both voltage mode aswell as current mode devices have proven
alternative to each other for satisfying the demand of the growing market. As
such, current conveyors have equitably established their uniqueness as an
important circuit design element. The literature available to us during the few
years in the field of analog VLSI design, quotes a huge number of application
elements based on current conveyors. Likely, in this paper, a new tunable low
power voltage amplifier based on the translinear circuit scheme of second
generation current controlled current conveyor has been proposed. The modeling
of the circuit presented in this paper employs the minimum number of passive
elements. The magnitude of the tuning or the amplitude of the voltage presented
here, is being controlled by means of two variable resistors. Current conveyor
second generation translinear circuit scheme is taken into consideration to
implement the proposed tunable voltage amplifier. CCCII works on the outlines
of low power and low voltage design. Tunable voltage amplifiers find use in

  Final version, to appear in the Journal of Differential Geometry",,,,"math.DG math.AT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Suppose $(X, g)$ is a compact, spin Riemannian 7-manifold, with Dirac
operator $D$. Let $G$ be SU$(m)$ or U$(m)$, and $E\to X$ be a rank $m$ complex
bundle with $G$-structure. Write ${\mathcal B}_E$ for the infinite-dimensional
moduli space of connections on $E$, modulo gauge. There is a natural principal
${\mathbb Z}_2$-bundle $O^D_E\to{\mathcal B}_E$ parametrizing orientations of
det$\,D_{{\rm Ad }A}$ for twisted elliptic operators $D_{{\rm Ad }A}$ at each
$[A]$ in ${\mathcal B}_E$. A theorem of Walpuski shows $O^D_E$ is
trivializable.
  We prove that if we choose an orientation for det$\,D$, and a flag structure
on X in the sense of Joyce arXiv:1610.09836, then we can define canonical
trivializations of $O^D_E$ for all such bundles $E\to X$, satisfying natural
compatibilities.
  Now let $(X,\varphi,g)$ be a compact $G_2$-manifold, with d$(*\varphi)=0$.
Then we can consider moduli spaces ${\mathcal M}_E^{G_2}$ of $G_2$-instantons
on $E\to X$, which are smooth manifolds under suitable transversality
conditions, and derived manifolds in general, with ${\mathcal
M}_E^{G_2}\subset{\mathcal B}_E$. The restriction of $O^D_E$ to ${\mathcal
M}_E^{G_2}$ is the ${\mathbb Z}_2$-bundle of orientations on ${\mathcal
M}_E^{G_2}$. Thus, our theorem induces canonical orientations on all such
$G_2$-instanton moduli spaces ${\mathcal M}_E^{G_2}$.
  This contributes to the Donaldson-Segal programme arXiv:0902.3239, which
proposes defining enumerative invariants of $G_2$-manifolds $(X,\varphi,g)$ by
counting moduli spaces ${\mathcal M}_E^{G_2}$, with signs depending on a choice

Live Vocalised Transcription, is presented. LVT is developed as a Max for Live

  Due to the wide differences in vocalisations from distinct users for the same

Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) for choosing the most relevant features for

between two metric spaces. However, there has been only limited algorithmic
development to compute or approximate this distance. We focus on computing the
Gromov-Hausdorff distance between two metric trees. Roughly speaking, a metric
tree is a metric space that can be realized by the shortest path metric on a
tree. Previously, Agarwal et al. showed that even for trees with unit edge
length, it is NP hard to approximate the GH distance between them within a
factor of 3. In this paper, we present a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT)
algorithm that can approximate the GH distance between two general metric trees
within a factor of 14.
  Interestingly, the development of our algorithm is made possible by a
connection between the GH distance for metric trees and the interleaving
distance for the so-called merge trees. The merge trees arise in practice
naturally as a simple yet meaningful topological summary, and are of
independent interest. It turns out that an exact or approximation algorithm for
the interleaving distance leads to an approximation algorithm for the
Gromov-Hausdorff distance. One of the key contributions of our work is that we
re-define the interleaving distance in a way that makes it easier to develop
dynamic programming approaches to compute it. We then present a FPT algorithm
to compute the interleaving distance between two merge trees exactly, which
ultimately leads to an FPT-algorithm to approximate the GH distance between two
metric trees. This exact FPT-algorithm to compute the interleaving distance
between merge trees is of interest itself, as it is known that it is NP-hard to
approximate it within a factor of 3, and previously the best known algorithm
has an approximation factor of $O(\sqrt{n})$ even for trees with unit edge

energy splitting reaches 70 meV and Fermi surface becomes noticeably distorted.

Licata, Amal Ahmed","Gradual Type Theory (Extended Version)","Extended version of ""Gradual Type Theory"", to appear POPL 2019",,,,"cs.PL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Gradually typed languages are designed to support both dynamically typed and
statically typed programming styles while preserving the benefits of each.
While existing gradual type soundness theorems for these languages aim to show
that type-based reasoning is preserved when moving from the fully static
setting to a gradual one, these theorems do not imply that correctness of
type-based refactorings and optimizations is preserved. Establishing
correctness of program transformations is technically difficult, and is often
neglected in the metatheory of gradual languages.
  In this paper, we propose an axiomatic account of program equivalence in a
gradual cast calculus, which we formalize in a logic we call gradual type
theory (GTT). Based on Levy's call-by-push-value, GTT gives an axiomatic
account of both call-by-value and call-by-name gradual languages. We then prove
theorems that justify optimizations and refactorings in gradually typed
languages. For example, uniqueness principles for gradual type connectives show
that if the $\beta\eta$ laws hold for a connective, then casts between that
connective must be equivalent to the lazy cast semantics. Contrapositively,
this shows that eager cast semantics violates the extensionality of function
types. As another example, we show that gradual upcasts are pure and dually,
gradual downcasts are strict. We show the consistency and applicability of our
theory by proving that an implementation using the lazy cast semantics gives a
logical relations model of our type theory, where equivalence in GTT implies
contextual equivalence of the programs. Since GTT also axiomatizes the dynamic
gradual guarantee, our model also establishes this central theorem of gradual
typing. The model is parametrized by the implementation of the dynamic types,
and so gives a family of implementations that validate type-based optimization
and the gradual guarantee.

between the longitudinal integral lengthscale ($L$) and the characteristic mean
flow width ($\delta$) using experimental data of an axisymmetric wake and a
turbulent planar jet. This is a fundamental hypothesis when deriving the
self-similar scaling laws in free shear flows, irrespective of turbulence
dissipation scaling. We show that $L/\delta$ is indeed constant, at least in a
range of streamwise distances between 15 and 50 times the characteristic inlet
dimension ($L_{ref}$, nozzle width or wake generator size). Furthermore, we
revisit turbulence closure models such as the Prandtl mixing length
\cite{prandtl1925} and the constant eddy viscosity in the light of the
non-equilibrium dissipation scalings. We show that the mixing length model,
with $l_m\sim \delta$, does not comply with the scalings stemming from the
non-equilibrium version of the theory; we instead obtain $l_m\sim \delta
\sqrt{Re_G/Re_{0\delta}}$, where $Re_G$ and $Re_{0\delta}$ are a global and
local Reynolds number, respectively. Similarly, the eddy viscosity model holds
in the case of the non-equilibrium version of the theory provided that the eddy
viscosity is constant everywhere, not only across sections orthogonal to the
streamwise direction as in the equilibrium case. We conclude comparing the
results of the different models with each other and with experimental data and
with an improved model (following Townsend) that accounts for the intermittency
of the flow and corrects for the eddy viscosity variation across the flow
boundaries.

the length distribution, to the natural emergence of very long proteins and
their relationship to evolutionary time. Here we consider the insight that
CoHSI might bring to a different problem, the distribution of identical
proteins across species. Horizontal and Vertical Gene Transfer (HGT/VGT) both
lead to the replication of protein sequences across species through a diversity
of mechanisms some of which remain unknown. In contrast, CoHSI predicts from
fundamental theory that such systems will demonstrate power law behavior
independently of any mechanisms, and using the Uniprot database we show that
the global pattern of protein re-use is emphatically linear on a log-log plot
(adj. $R^{2} = 0.99, p < 2.2 \times 10^{-16}$ over 4 decades); i.e. it is
extremely close to the predicted power law. Specifically we show that over 6.9
million proteins in TrEMBL 18-02 are re-used, i.e. their sequence appears
identically in between 2 and 9,812 species, with re-used proteins varying in
length from 7 to as long as 14,596 amino acids. Using (DL+V) to denote the
three domains of life plus viruses, 21,676 proteins are shared between two
(DL+V); 22 between three (DL+V) and 5 are shared in all four (DL+V). Although
the majority of protein re-use occurs between bacterial species those proteins
most frequently re-used occur disproportionately in viruses, which play a
fundamental role in this distribution.
  These results suggest that diverse mechanisms of gene transfer (including
traditional inheritance) are irrelevant in determining the global distribution

inspection, the headset needs to be localized. While external pose estimation
and fiducial marker based localization would require setup, maintenance, and
manual calibration; marker-free self-localization can be achieved using the
onboard depth sensor and camera. However, due to limited depth sensor range of
portable mixed-reality headsets like Microsoft HoloLens, localization based on
simple point cloud registration (sPCR) would require extensive mapping of the
environment. Also, localization based on camera image would face the same
issues as stereo ambiguities and hence depends on viewpoint. We thus introduce
a novel approach to Joint Point Cloud and Image-based Localization (JPIL) for
mixed-reality headsets that use visual cues and headset orientation to register
small, partially overlapped point clouds and save significant manual labor and
time in environment mapping. Our empirical results compared to sPCR show
average 10 fold reduction of required overlap surface area that could
potentially save on average 20 minutes per inspection. JPIL is not only
restricted to inspection tasks but also can be essential in enabling intuitive
human-robot interaction for spatial mapping and scene understanding in
conjunction with other agents like autonomous robotic systems that are
increasingly being deployed in outdoor environments for applications like

hard to capture fine-grained contextual information in hand-crafted or explicit
manners, such as the correlation between different areas in a local region,
which limits the discriminative ability of learned features. To resolve this
issue, we propose a novel deep learning model for 3D point clouds, named
Point2Sequence, to learn 3D shape features by capturing fine-grained contextual
information in a novel implicit way. Point2Sequence employs a novel sequence
learning model for point clouds to capture the correlations by aggregating
multi-scale areas of each local region with attention. Specifically,
Point2Sequence first learns the feature of each area scale in a local region.
Then, it captures the correlation between area scales in the process of
aggregating all area scales using a recurrent neural network (RNN) based
encoder-decoder structure, where an attention mechanism is proposed to
highlight the importance of different area scales. Experimental results show
that Point2Sequence achieves state-of-the-art performance in shape

no polarization anisotropy within photonic band gap (PBG, stop gap, stop band)
of high symmetry points in normal incidence. None the less because two
directions at right angles to each other on the plane (001) are
constitutionally and optically identical in appearance, the polarization
orientation of a reflected wave rotated by 90 degrees from that of an incident
wave at a frequency within the PBG when that of the incident wave was the
direction that bisects these two directions. The 3D-PC is a silicon inverse
diamond structure whose lattice point shape is vacant regular octahedrons. In
this work, the phase-difference, size and orientation of electric-field of the

embrace a political orientation. Data scientists must recognize themselves as
political actors engaged in normative constructions of society and evaluate
their work according to its downstream impacts on people's lives. I first
articulate why data scientists must recognize themselves as political actors.
In this section, I respond to three arguments that data scientists commonly
invoke when challenged to take political positions regarding their work. In
confronting these arguments, I describe why attempting to remain apolitical is
itself a political stance--a fundamentally conservative one--and why data
science's attempts to promote ""social good"" dangerously rely on unarticulated
and incrementalist political assumptions. I then propose a framework for how
data science can evolve toward a deliberative and rigorous politics of social
justice. I conceptualize the process of developing a politically engaged data

empower data scientists with new methods for thoughtfully and rigorously

prioritization of pavement maintenance and rehabilitation (M&R) have been
mainly focused on three parameters; the pre-treatment pavement condition, the
rehabilitation cost, and the available budget. Yet, the role of the candidate
projects' spatial characteristics in the decision-making process has not been
deeply considered. Such a limitation, predominately, allows the recommended M&R
projects' schedule to involve simultaneously running but spatially scattered
construction sites, which are very challenging to monitor and manage. This
study introduces a novel approach to integrate pavement segments' spatial
coordinates into the M&R prioritization analysis. The introduced approach aims
at combining the pavement segments with converged spatial coordinates to be
repaired in the same timeframe without compromising the allocated budget levels
or the overall target Pavement Condition Index (PCI). Such a combination would
result in minimizing the routing of crews, materials and other equipment among
the construction sites and would provide better collaborations and
communications between the pavement maintenance teams. Proposed herein is a
novel spatial clustering algorithm that automatically finds the projects within
a certain budget and spatial constrains. The developed algorithm was
successfully validated using 1,800 pavement maintenance projects from two
real-life examples of the City of Milton, GA and the City of Tyler, TX.

guaranteeing valid solid models and continuous shape changes. Further, this
formulation allows for an easy implementation of push-pull direct modeling

predominantly in time near eclipse ingress and egress, have intensities up to

and the dispersion measure do not vary in connection with BSP outbursts. The
average profile obtained from BSPs has the same shape as the average profile
from all pulses. These properties make it difficult to explain BSPs via
scintillation in the interstellar medium, as a separate emission mode, or as

signals in the 2-12keV energy band of spectra extracted from Perseus Cluster
core region observations obtained with the 5eV energy resolution Hitomi Soft
X-ray Spectrometer. No significant unidentified line emission or absorption is
found. Line flux upper limits (1 sigma per resolution element) vary with photon
energy and assumed intrinsic width, decreasing from 100 photons cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$ sr $^{-1}$ at 2keV to $<10$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr $^{-1}$ over most of
the 5-10 keV energy range for a Gaussian line with Doppler broadening of 640
km/s. Limits for narrower and broader lines have a similar energy dependence
and are systematically smaller and larger, respectively. These line flux limits
are used to constrain the decay rate of hypothetical dark matter candidates.
For the sterile neutrino decay rate, new constraints over the the mass range of
4-24 keV with mass resolution better than any previous X-ray analysis are
obtained. Additionally, the accuracy of relevant thermal spectral models and
atomic data are evaluated. The Perseus cluster spectra may be described by a
composite of multi-temperature thermal and AGN power-law continua. Superposed
on these, a few line emission signals possibly originating from unmodeled
atomic processes (including Si XIV and Fe XXV) are marginally detected and
tabulated. Comparisons with previous X-ray upper limits and future prospects
for dark matter searches using high-energy resolution spectroscopy are
discussed.

  Nov 2015, Lyon, France. 2015",,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: Supply chain has become very complex today. There are multiple
stakeholders at various points. All these stakeholders need to collaborate with
each other in multiple directions for its effective and efficient management.
The manufacturers need proper information and data about the product location,
its processing history, raw materials, etc at each point so as to control the
production process. Companies need to develop global and effective strategies
to sustain in the competitive market. Logistics helps companies to implement
the effectiveness across the business supply chain from source to destination
to achieve their strategic goals. Traceability has become one of the integrated
parts of the supply chain logistics management that track and trace the
product's information in upstream and downstream at each point. All the
stakeholders in the supply chain have different objectives to implement the
traceability solution that depends on their role (e.g. manufacturers,
distributers or wholesalers have their own role). The information generated and
needed from all these actors are also different and are to be shared among all
to run the supply chain smoothly. But the stakeholders don't want to share all
the information with other stake holders which is a major challenge to be
addressed in current traceability solutions. The purpose of this research is to
conduct thorough study of the literatures available on the traceability
solutions, finding the gaps and recommending our views to enhance the
collaborations among the stakeholders in every point of the business supply
chain. The study will be helpful for further researchers to propose a
traceability meta-model to address the gaps. Design/methodology/approach: The
relevant literatures with keywords supply chain management, traceability,
logistics management are searched from the trusted database. The scope and the
objectives of the research is set based on which the papers are filtered as per
the titles and abstract. Proper analyses of the screened papers are done and
the recommendations are given. Findings: Traceability solution is popular among
the industries since a long for their supply chain management. After proper
analysis of the available literatures about the traceability solution the
industries use, this research will identify the gaps based on which we give the
proper recommendations and perspectives of our work.

embedding graphs has targeted undirected networks and very little has focused
on the thorny issue of embedding directed networks. In this paper, we instead
propose to solve the directed graph embedding problem via a two-stage approach:
in the first stage, the graph is symmetrized in one of several possible ways,
and in the second stage, the so-obtained symmetrized graph is embedded using
any state-of-the-art (undirected) graph embedding algorithm. Note that it is
not the objective of this paper to propose a new (undirected) graph embedding
algorithm or discuss the strengths and weaknesses of existing ones; all we are
saying is that whichever be the suitable graph embedding algorithm, it will fit
in the above proposed symmetrization framework.

distribution to parts of a co-occurrence graph, is proposed for detecting signs
of structural changes in the data that are informative in explaining latent
dynamics of consumers behavior. For obtaining graph-based entropy, connected
subgraphs are first obtained from the graph of co-occurrences of items in the
data. Then, the distribution of items occurring in events in the data to these
sub-graphs is reflected on the value of graph-based entropy. For the data on
the position of sale, a change in this value is regarded as a sign of the
appearance, the separation, the disappearance, or the uniting of consumers
interests. These phenomena are regarded as the signs of dynamic changes in
consumers behavior that may be the effects of external events and information.
Experiments show that graph-based entropy outperforms baseline methods that can
be used for change detection, in explaining substantial changes and their signs
in consumers preference of items in supermarket stores.

THz links into existing fiber-optic infrastructures is of great importance to
complement the inherent portability and flexibility advantages of wireless
networks by the reliable and virtually unlimited capacity of optical
transmission systems. On the technological level, this requires novel device
and signal processing concepts for direct conversion of data streams between
the THz and the optical domains. Here, we report on the first demonstration of
a THz link that is seamlessly integrated into a fiber-optic network using
direct terahertz-to-optical (T/O) conversion at the wireless receiver. We
exploit an ultra-broadband silicon-plasmonic modulator having a 3 dB bandwidth
in excess of 0.36 THz for T/O conversion of a 50 Gbit/s data stream that is
transmitted on a 0.2885 THz carrier over a 16 m-long wireless link.
Optical-to-terahertz (O/T) conversion at the wireless transmitter relies on
photomixing in a uni-travelling-carrier photodiode.
