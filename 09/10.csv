capture, ${}^{157}$Gd$(n,\gamma){}^{158}$Gd, on an enriched $^{157}$Gd target
(Gd$_{2}$O$_{3}$) in the energy range from 0.11 MeV up to about 8 MeV. The
target was placed inside the germanium spectrometer of the ANNRI detector at
J-PARC and exposed to a neutron beam from the Japan Spallation Neutron Source
(JSNS). Radioactive sources ($^{60}$Co, $^{137}$Cs, and $^{152}$Eu) and the
reaction $^{35}$Cl($n$,$\gamma$) were used to determine the spectrometer's
detection efficiency for $\gamma$ rays at energies from 0.3 to 8.5 MeV. Using a
Geant4-based Monte Carlo simulation of the detector and based on our data, we
have developed a model to describe the $\gamma$-ray spectrum from the thermal
${}^{157}$Gd($n$,$\gamma$) reaction. While we include the strength information
of 15 prominent peaks above 5 MeV and associated peaks below 1.6 MeV from our
data directly into the model, we rely on the theoretical inputs of nuclear
level density and the photon strength function of ${}^{158}$Gd to describe the
continuum $\gamma$-ray spectrum from the ${}^{157}$Gd($n$,$\gamma$) reaction.
Our model combines these two components. The results of the comparison between
the observed $\gamma$-ray spectra from the reaction and the model are reported
in detail.

recognition neural networks is a novel pore-scale modeling method that has a
great potential. This article presents a framework that includes (1) generation
of porous media samples, (2) computation of permeability via fluid dynamics
simulations, (3) training of convolutional neural networks (CNN) with simulated
data, and (4) validations against simulations. Comparison of machine learning
results and the ground truths suggests excellent predictive performance across
a wide range of porosities and pore geometries, especially for those with
dilated pores. Owning to such heterogeneity, the permeability cannot be
estimated using the conventional Kozeny-Carman approach. Computational time was
reduced by several orders of magnitude compared to fluid dynamic simulations.
We found that, by including physical parameters that are known to affect
permeability into the neural network, the physics-informed CNN generated better
results than regular CNN, however improvements vary with implemented
heterogeneity.

This hampers interchangeability, interoperability, and tooling support. In

wavefunction methods in density functional theory. Partitioning between the
correlated wavefunction and density functional subsystems is performed in the

change--such as a chemical reaction--the nature of these localized molecular
orbitals, as well as their partitioning into the two subsystems, can change
dramatically. This can lead to unphysical cusps and even discontinuities in the
potential energy surface. In this work, we present an even-handed framework for
localized orbital partitioning that ensures consistent subsystems across a set

solution with a simple example of an SN2 reaction. Applications to a nitrogen
umbrella flip in a cobalt-based CO2 reduction catalyst and to the binding of CO
to Cu clusters are presented. In both cases, we find that even-handed

an explicitly evaluative utterance e.g. Chanpen Thai is the best option, along
with content related by the justification discourse relation, e.g. It has great

While neural generation methods integrate sentence planning and surface
realization in one end-to-end learning framework, previous work has not shown
that neural generators can: (1) perform common sentence planning and discourse
structuring operations; (2) make decisions as to whether to realize content in
a single sentence or over multiple sentences; (3) generalize sentence planning
and discourse relation operations beyond what was seen in training. We
systematically create large training corpora that exhibit particular sentence
planning operations and then test neural models to see what they learn. We
compare models without explicit latent variables for sentence planning with

finger or hand movements without the aid of any hand-held device. In this work,
we address the problem of mid-air finger writing using web-cam video as input.
In spite of recent advances in object detection and tracking, accurate and
robust detection and tracking of the fingertip remains a challenging task,
primarily due to small dimension of the fingertip. Moreover, the initialization
and termination of mid-air finger writing is also challenging due to the
absence of any standard delimiting criterion. To solve these problems, we
propose a new writing hand pose detection algorithm for initialization of
air-writing using the Faster R-CNN framework for accurate hand detection
followed by hand segmentation and finally counting the number of raised fingers
based on geometrical properties of the hand. Further, we propose a robust
fingertip detection and tracking approach using a new signature function called
distance-weighted curvature entropy. Finally, a fingertip velocity-based
termination criterion is used as a delimiter to mark the completion of the
air-writing gesture. Experiments show the superiority of the proposed fingertip
detection and tracking algorithm over state-of-the-art approaches giving a mean
precision of 73.1 % while achieving real-time performance at 18.5 fps, a
condition which is of vital importance to air-writing. Character recognition
experiments give a mean accuracy of 96.11 % using the proposed air-writing
system, a result which is comparable to that of existing handwritten character
recognition systems.

this by developing some very general categorical coherence theory. We combine
results of Corner and Gurski, Power, and Lack, to develop a strictification
theory for pseudoalgebras over operads and monads. It specializes to strictify
genuine symmetric monoidal G-categories to genuine permutative G-categories.
All of our work takes place in a general internal categorical framework that
has many quite different specializations.
  When G is a finite group, the theory here combines with previous work to
generalize equivariant infinite loop space theory from strict space level input
to considerably more general category level input. It takes genuine symmetric
monoidal G-categories as input to an equivariant infinite loop space machine
that gives genuine G-spectra as output.

recognition of this challenge, we propose a new SA algorithm that is designed

the observation of phase-dependent zero-bias conductance peaks measured by

environmental circumstances, we characterize their energetics, mixing and
spectral behavior through a series of direct numerical simulations of
turbulence generated by Holmboe wave instability (HWI) under various initial
conditions. We focus on circumstances where the stratification is sufficiently
`strong' so that HWI is the dominant primary instability of the flow. Our
numerical findings demonstrate the emergence of self-organised criticality
(SOC) that is manifest as an adjustment of an appropriately defined gradient
Richardson number, $Ri_g$, associated with the horizontally-averaged mean flow,
in such a way that it is continuously attracted towards a critical value of
$Ri_g \sim 1/4$. This self-organization occurs through a continuously
reinforced localisation of the `scouring' motions (i.e. `avalanches') that are
characteristic of the turbulence induced by the break down of Holmboe wave
instabilities and are developed on the upper and lower flanks of the sharply
localized density interface, embedded within a much more diffuse shear layer.
These localised `avalanches' are also found to exhibit the expected scale
invariant characteristics. From an energetics perspective, the emergence of SOC
is expressed in the form of a long-lived turbulent flow that remains in a
`quasi-equilibrium' state for an extended period of time. Most importantly, the
irreversible mixing that results from such self-organised behavior appears to
be characterized generically by a universal cumulative turbulent flux
coefficient of $\Gamma_c \sim 0.2$ only for turbulent flows engendered by
Holmboe wave instability. The existence of this self-organised critical state
corroborates the original physical arguments associated with self-regulation of
stratified turbulent flows as involving a `kind of equilibrium' as described by
Turner (1973).

two impurity based electrical contacts produced with B implantation and Li

detectors, the Li contact in particular is thick and lacks room temperature
stability in a manner that makes it inappropriate for many of the more complex
detectors needed for gamma-ray imaging and particle tracking applications. Thin
films of amorphous semiconductors such as sputter deposited amorphous Ge (a-Ge)
are the basis for an alternative electrical contact that is easy to fabricate,
thin, and can be finely segmented. The a-Ge also functions well as a
passivation coating on the HPGe surfaces not covered by the electrical

through the sputter deposition process parameters. The subject of this paper is
this interconnection of fabrication process parameters, a-Ge properties, and
detector performance. The properties of a-Ge thin film electrical resistance,
a-Ge contact electron injection, and room temperature storage stability were
evaluated as a function of the sputter process parameters of sputter gas

systems were used to produce a-Ge resistors and HPGe detectors with a-Ge
electrical contacts. These samples were electrically characterized as a
function of temperature. A summary of this study and discussion of the

multiple areas of machine learning. This paper is focused on graph-Laplacian
dimension reduction for the spectral clustering of data as a primary
application. Spectral embedding provides a low-dimensional parametrization of
the data manifold which makes the subsequent task (e.g., clustering) much
easier. However, despite reducing the dimensionality of data, the overall
computational cost may still be prohibitive for large data sets due to two
factors. First, computing the partial eigendecomposition of the graph-Laplacian
typically requires a large Krylov subspace. Second, after the spectral
embedding is complete, one still has to operate with the same number of data
points. For example, clustering of the embedded data is typically performed
with various relaxations of k-means which computational cost scales poorly with
respect to the size of data set. In this work, we switch the focus from the
entire data set to a subset of graph vertices (target subset). We develop two
novel algorithms for such low-dimensional representation of the original graph
that preserves important global distances between the nodes of the target
subset. In particular, it allows to ensure that target subset clustering is
consistent with the spectral clustering of the full data set if one would
perform such. That is achieved by a properly parametrized reduced-order model
(ROM) of the graph-Laplacian that approximates accurately the diffusion
transfer function of the original graph for inputs and outputs restricted to
the target subset. Working with a small target subset reduces greatly the
required dimension of Krylov subspace and allows to exploit the conventional
algorithms (like approximations of k-means) in the regimes when they are most
robust and efficient.

interference across cells creates dependencies across the entire network,
making the optimization problem computationally challenging as the size of the
network becomes large. A suboptimal solution is presented, which performs well
in networks consisting of one hundred access points (APs) serving several
hundred user devices. This is achieved by optimizing over local overlapping
neighborhoods, defined by interference conditions, and by exploiting the
sparsity of a globally optimal solution. Specifically, with a total of $k$ user
devices in the entire network, it suffices to divide the spectrum into $k$
segments, where each segment is mapped to a particular set, or pattern, of
active APs within each local neighborhood. The problem is then to find a
mapping of segments to patterns, and to optimize the widths of the segments. A
convex relaxation is proposed for this, which relies on a re-weighted $\ell_1$
approximation of an $\ell_0$ constraint, and is used to enforce the mapping of
a unique pattern to each spectrum segment. A distributed implementation based
on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is also proposed.
Numerical comparisons with benchmark schemes show that the proposed method

Using this technique, per-iteration estimated values and updates are

similar to their use in policy gradient reinforcement learning. The new
formulation allows estimates to be bootstrapped from other estimates within the
same episode, propagating the benefits of baselines along the sampled

estimates. Finally, we show that given a perfect baseline, the variance of the

telescopes push towards higher signal-to-noise ratios, jitter becomes the next
dominant term for most millisecond pulsars. Understanding the statistics of
jitter becomes crucial for properly characterizing arrival-time uncertainties.
We characterize the radio-frequency dependence of jitter using data on 48
pulsars in the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves
(NANOGrav) timing program. We detect significant jitter in 43 of the pulsars
and test several functional forms for its frequency dependence; we find
significant frequency dependence for 30 pulsars. We find moderate correlations
of rms jitter with pulse width (R = 0.62) and number of profile components (R =
0.40); the single-pulse rms jitter is typically ~1% of pulse phase. The average
frequency dependence for all pulsars using a power-law model has index -0.42.
We investigate the jitter variations for the interpulse of PSR~B1937+21 and
find no significant deviations from the main pulse rms jitter. We also test the
time-variation of jitter in two pulsars and find that systematics likely bias
the results for high-precision pulsars. Pulsar timing array analyses must
properly model jitter as a significant component of the noise within the
detector.

  Attacks from Concentration of Measure",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CC cs.CR stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many modern machine learning classifiers are shown to be vulnerable to
adversarial perturbations of the instances. Despite a massive amount of work
focusing on making classifiers robust, the task seems quite challenging. In
this work, through a theoretical study, we investigate the adversarial risk and
robustness of classifiers and draw a connection to the well-known phenomenon of
concentration of measure in metric measure spaces. We show that if the metric
probability space of the test instance is concentrated, any classifier with
some initial constant error is inherently vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations.
  One class of concentrated metric probability spaces are the so-called Levy
families that include many natural distributions. In this special case, our
attacks only need to perturb the test instance by at most $O(\sqrt n)$ to make
it misclassified, where $n$ is the data dimension. Using our general result
about Levy instance spaces, we first recover as special case some of the
previously proved results about the existence of adversarial examples. However,
many more Levy families are known (e.g., product distribution under the Hamming
distance) for which we immediately obtain new attacks that find adversarial
examples of distance $O(\sqrt n)$.
  Finally, we show that concentration of measure for product spaces implies the
existence of forms of ""poisoning"" attacks in which the adversary tampers with
the training data with the goal of degrading the classifier. In particular, we
show that for any learning algorithm that uses $m$ training examples, there is
an adversary who can increase the probability of any ""bad property"" (e.g.,
failing on a particular test instance) that initially happens with
non-negligible probability to $\approx 1$ by substituting only $\tilde{O}(\sqrt
m)$ of the examples with other (still correctly labeled) examples.

made of HgTe quantum well coupled to thin-film aluminum, we are able to tune
between a trivial and a topological superconducting state by controlling the
phase difference $\phi$ across the junction and applying an in-plane magnetic
field. We determine the topological state of the induced superconductor by
measuring the tunneling conductance at the edge of the junction. At low
magnetic fields, we observe a minimum in the tunneling spectra near zero bias,
consistent with a trivial superconductor. However, as the magnetic field
increases, the tunneling conductance develops a zero-bias peak which persists
over a range of $\phi$ that expands systematically with increasing magnetic
fields. Our observations are consistent with theoretical predictions for this
system and with full quantum mechanical numerical simulations performed on
model systems with similar dimensions and parameters. Our work establishes this
system as a promising platform for realizing topological superconductivity and
for creating and manipulating Majorana modes and will therefore open new

objects such as the Cayley hyperdeterminant (the `tangle') can be directly

triplets of taxa. In other cases new objects appear, such as the remarkable
quintic `squangle' invariants for quartet tree discrimination and DNA data,
with their own unique interpretation in the phylogenetic modeling context.

parsec-scale mid-IR polar dust emission in some nearby AGNs, we develop
semi-empirical SED libraries for reddened type-1 AGNs built on the quasar

the nuclear UV-to-IR SED and the strong mid-IR polar dust emission of NGC 3783,
the type-1 AGN with the most relevant and robust observational constraints. In
addition, we compile 64 low-$z$ Seyfert-1 nuclei with negligible mid-IR star
formation contamination and satisfactorily fit the individual IR SEDs as well
as the composite UV to mid-IR composite SEDs. Given the success of these fits,
we characterize the possible infrared SED of AGN polar dust emission and
utilize a simple but effective strategy to infer its prevalence among type-1
AGNs. The SEDs of high-$z$ peculiar AGNs, including the extremely red quasars,
mid-IR warm-excess AGNs, and hot dust-obscured galaxies, can be also reproduced

to be upper bounded by $[(L^3 \log d)/n]^{1/2}$, where $d$ is the input

some values of the parameters at all, if she can win for some values below an
exponential bound. For many winning conditions, this implies decidability of
any statements about a player being able to win with arbitrary quantification
over the parameter values.
  While the result seems broadly applicable, a specific motivation comes from
the study of chains of strategies in games. Chains of games were recently
suggested as a means to define a rationality notion based on dominance that
works well with quantitative games by Bassett, Jecker, P., Raskin and Van den
Boogard. From the main result of this paper, we obtain generalizations of their
decidability results with much simpler proofs.

notion of potential independent interest, we look at boolean functions defined

determine the knowledge that the agents gain after communication. Finally, we
describe how a distributed task specification can be modeled as a DEL action

can be proved by admitting synchronization rules with a trigger, but forcing
them to suitably check constraints only in the future with respect to the
trigger (future simple rules). More ""tractable"" results can be obtained by
additionally constraining the form of intervals in future simple rules:
EXPSPACE-completeness is guaranteed by avoiding singular intervals,
PSPACE-completeness by admitting only intervals of the forms [0,a] and

from cost uncertainty, since spot prices fluctuate, in part, based on supply,

the latter cannot infer the availability and performance of spot VMs, which are
a function of their variable price. To address the problem, we use properties

to define an aggregate index price for spot VMs that serves as a reference for
what users should expect to pay. We show that, even when the spot prices for
individual VMs are volatile, the index price remains stable and predictable. We
then introduce cloud index tracking: a migration policy that tracks the index
price to ensure applications running on spot VMs incur a predictable cost by
migrating to a new spot VM if the current VM's price significantly deviates

seasonality trends. Gated structure of LSTM cell and flexibility in network
topology (one-to-many, many-to-one, etc.) allows to model systems with multiple
input variables and control several parameters such as the size of the
look-back window to make a prediction and number of time steps to be predicted.
These make LSTM attractive tool over conventional methods such as
autoregression models, the simple average, moving average, naive approach,
ARIMA, Holt's linear trend method, Holt's Winter seasonal method, and others.
In this paper, we propose a hardware implementation of LSTM network
architecture for time-series forecasting problem. All simulations were
performed using TSMC 0.18um CMOS technology and HP memristor model.

implemented in elder homes in Hong Kong to support the monitoring of vital
signs of the elderly. During a pilot study, it was discovered that the systolic
blood pressure was incorrectly measured during multiple weeks. A real-time
solution was needed to identify future data quality issues as soon as possible.
  Methods: Control charts are an effective tool for real-time monitoring and
signaling issues (changes) in data. In this study, as in other healthcare
applications, many observations are missing. Few methods are available for
monitoring data with missing observations. A data quality monitoring method is
developed to signal issues with the accuracy of the collected data quickly.
This method has the ability to deal with missing observations. A Hotelling's
T-squared control chart is selected as the basis for our proposed method.
  Findings: The proposed method is retrospectively validated on a case study
with a known measurement error in the systolic blood pressure measurements. The
method is able to adequately detect this data quality problem. The proposed
method was integrated into a personalized telehealth monitoring system and
prospectively implemented in a second case study. It was found that the
proposed scheme supports the control of data quality.
  Conclusions: Data quality is an important issue and control charts are useful
for real-time monitoring of data quality. However, these charts must be
adjusted to account for missing data that often occur in healthcare context.

which induces a non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect. Nonzero imaginary
magnetic flux invalidates the bulk-boundary correspondence and leads to a
topological phase transition. However, the way of non-Hermiticity appearance
may alter the system topology. By alternatively introducing the non-Hermiticity
under symmetry to prevent nonzero imaginary magnetic flux, the bulk-boundary
correspondence recovers and every bulk state becomes extended; the bulk
topology of Bloch Hamiltonian predicts the (non)existence of edge states and
topological phase transition. These are elucidated in a non-Hermitian
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, where chiral-inversion symmetry ensures the
vanishing of imaginary magnetic flux. The average value of Pauli matrices under
the eigenstate of chiral-inversion symmetric Bloch Hamiltonian defines a vector
field, the vorticity of topological defects in the vector field is a
topological invariant. Our findings are applicable in other non-Hermitian
systems. We first uncover the roles played by non-Hermitian AB effect and
chiral-inversion symmetry for the breakdown and recovery of bulk-boundary
correspondence, and develop new insights for understanding non-Hermitian
topological phases of matter.

diagnostics. In practice, image resolution is restricted by factors like
hardware, cost and processing constraints. Recently, deep learning methods have
been shown to produce compelling state of the art results for image
super-resolution. Paying particular attention to desired hi-resolution MR image
structure, we propose a new regularized network that exploits image priors,
namely a low-rank structure and a sharpness prior to enhance deep MR image
superresolution. Our contributions are then incorporating these priors in an
analytically tractable fashion in the learning of a convolutional neural
network (CNN) that accomplishes the super-resolution task. This is particularly
challenging for the low rank prior, since the rank is not a differentiable
function of the image matrix (and hence the network parameters), an issue we
address by pursuing differentiable approximations of the rank. Sharpness is
emphasized by the variance of the Laplacian which we show can be implemented by
a fixed {\em feedback} layer at the output of the network. Experiments
performed on two publicly available MR brain image databases exhibit promising
results particularly when training imagery is limited.

realistic 3D models, which is a very important task in computer graphics.
However, if the shape of the casual image does not look like the target model
or the target mapping area, the textured model will become strange since the
image will be distorted very much. In this paper, we present a novel texturing
and deforming approach for mapping the pattern and shape of a casual image to a
3D model at the same time based on an alternating least-square approach.
Through a photogrammetric method, we project the target model onto the source
image according to the estimated camera model. Then, the target model is
deformed according to the shape of the source image using a surface-based
deformation method while minimizing the image distortion simultaneously. The
processes are performed iteratively until convergence. Hence, our method can
achieve texture mapping, shape deformation, and detail-preserving at once, and
can obtain more reasonable texture mapped results than traditional methods.

constraints: request-level constraint ensures user experience for each user

impressions through both guaranteed contracts and RTB is a straightforward
choice for a publisher to maximize its yield. However, deriving the optimal
strategy to allocate impressions is not a trivial task, especially when the
environment is unstable in real-world applications. In this paper, we formulate
the impression allocation problem as an auction problem where each contract can
submit virtual bids for individual impressions. With this formulation, we
derive the optimal impression allocation strategy by solving the optimal
bidding functions for contracts. Since the bids from contracts are decided by
the publisher, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach
to derive cooperative policies for the publisher to maximize its yield in an

(900 $\leq cz \leq$ 12,000 \kms) and were chosen from SDSS DR5 such that the
optical luminosity function was sampled as uniformly as possible. The HI mass
function (HIMF) derived from our raw-data BLF, which is based on HI detections
only, is consistent with the HIMFs derived from other optically selected
surveys in that the low-mass slope is flatter than those derived from blind HI
surveys. However, spanning the entire luminosity range of NIBLES, we identify a
highly consistent distribution of the HI gas mass to luminosity ratio
(gas-to-light ratio) with a predictable progression in the mean MHI/Lr ratio as
a function of Lr. This consistency allows us to construct plausible
gas-to-light ratio distributions for very low-luminosity bins which lie outside
the NIBLES sample. We also identify a $\sim$ 10% decrease in detection fraction
for galaxies fainter than log(\Lr) = 9.25, consistent with the expected
decrease due to distance and sensitivity effects. Accounting for these trends,
we reconstruct plausible gas-to-light distributions spanning luminosity bins
down to log(\Lr) = 5.25, thus producing a corrected BLF. This corrected BLF is
in good qualitative agreement with optical luminosity-HI mass distributions
from the ALFALFA survey and is able to accurately reproduce blind survey HIMFs,
lending credibility that this two dimensional optical luminosity-HI mass
distribution is an accurate representation of the volume density distribution
of galaxies in the local universe. We also note that our agreement with HIMFs
from other surveys is dependent on accounting for all systematic differences

forms a half-vortex in the two-dimensional surface momentum space. The
half-vortex is centered where the Fermi arc of the reflecting surface touches
the Weyl cone, with the magnitude of the shift scaling as an inverse square
root away from the touching-point, and diverging at the touching-point. This
striking feature provides a way to use bulk transport to probe the topological
characteristics of a Weyl medium.

interacting with a Bose-Einstein condensate. The Fermi superfluid is
topologically non-trivial and hosts a zero-energy Majorana bound state at the
vortex core. Assuming a repulsive $s$-wave contact interaction between fermions
and bosons, we find that fermions are depleted from the vortex core when the
bosonic density becomes sufficiently large. In this case, a dynamically-driven
local interface emerges between fermions and bosons, along which chiral
Majorana edge states should appear.We examine in detail the variation of
vortex-core structures as well as the formation of chiral Majorana edge states
with increasing bosonic density. In particular, when the angular momentum of
the vortex matches the chirality of the Fermi superfluid, the Majorana zero
mode and normal bound states within the core continuously evolve into chiral
Majorana edge states. Otherwise, a first-order transition occurs in the lowest
excited state within the core, due to the competition between counter-rotating
normal bound states in forming chiral Majorana edge states. Such a transition
is manifested as a sharp peak in the excitation gap above the Majorana zero
mode, at which point the Majorana zero mode is protected by a large excitation
gap.Our study presents an illuminating example on how topological defects can
be dynamically controlled in the context of cold atomic gases.

there are several different quantization procedures to cosmological
perturbations, for instance, {\em the deformed algebra, dressed metric, and
hybrid quantizations}. This paper devotes to study the quantum bounce effects
of primordial perturbations in the hybrid approach. The main discrepancy of
this approach is the effective positive mass at the quantum bounce for the
evolution of the background that is dominated by the kinetic energy of the
inflaton field at the bounce, while this mass is always nonpositive in the
dressed metric approach. It is this positivity of the effective mass that
violates the adiabatic evolution of primordial perturbations at the initial
moments of the quantum bounce. With the assumption that the evolution of the
background is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton at the bounce, we
find that the effective potentials for both scalar and tensor perturbations can
be well approximately described by a P\""{o}schl-Teller (PT) potential, which
allows us to find analytical solutions of perturbations, and from these
analytical expressions we are able to study the non-adiabatic evolution of
primordial perturbations in details. In particular, we derive their quantum
bounce effects and investigate their observational constraints. In addition,
the impacts of quantum bounce effects on the non-Gaussinity and their
implication on the explanations of observed power asymmetry in CMB have also

expressions of the wavefunctions are given by generalizations of the Whittaker
functions introduced by Bump-Friedberg-Hoffstein. The special case is the
correspondence conjectured by Brubaker-Bump-Chinta-Gunnells. We also show the
factorized forms for the domain wall boundary partition functions for both

dual Cauchy formulas for the generalized symplectic Schur functions and the

  Nonrectifying-barrier-type Indium Electrodes",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The electrical contact to two-dimensional (2D)-semiconductor materials are
decisive to the electronic performance of 2D-semiconductor field-effect devices
(FEDs). The presence of a Schottky barrier often leads to a large contact
resistance, which seriously limits the channel conductance and carrier mobility
measured in a two-terminal geometry. In contrast, ohmic contact is desirable
and can be achieved by the presence of a nonrectifying or tunneling barrier.
Here, we demonstrate that an nonrectifying barrier can be realized by
contacting indium (In), a low work function metal, with layered InSe because of
a favorable band alignment at the In-InSe interface. The nonrectifying barrier
is manifested by ohmic contact behavior at T=2 K and a low barrier height,
{\Phi}$_B$=50 meV. This ohmic contact enables demonstration of an ON-current as
large as 410 {\mu}A/{\mu}m, which is among the highest values achieved in FEDs
based on layered semiconductors. A high electron mobility of 3,700 and 1,000
cm$^2$/Vs is achieved with the two-terminal In-InSe FEDs at T=2 K and room
temperature, respectively, which can be attributed to enhanced quality of both
conduction channel and the contacts. The improvement in the contact quality is
further proven by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study, which suggests
that a reduction effect occurs at the In-InSe interface. The demonstration of
high-performance In-InSe FEDs indicates a viable interface engineering method
for next-generation, 2D-semiconductor-based electronics.

Encouragingly, our system achieves up-to $98.7\%$ cell load balancing in terms

Recommending on small e-commerce enterprises is rather challenging due to the
lower volume of interactions and low user loyalty, rarely extending beyond a
single session. On the other hand, we usually have to deal with lower volumes
of objects, which are easier to discover by users through various
browsing/searching GUIs.
  The main goal of this paper is to determine applicability of off-line
evaluation metrics in learning true usability of recommender systems (evaluated
on-line in A/B testing). In total 800 variants of recommending algorithms were
evaluated off-line w.r.t. 18 metrics covering rating-based, ranking-based,
novelty and diversity evaluation. The off-line results were afterwards compared
with on-line evaluation of 12 selected recommender variants and based on the
results, we tried to learn and utilize an off-line to on-line results

  Off-line results shown a great variance in performance w.r.t. different
metrics with the Pareto front covering 68\% of the approaches. Furthermore, we
observed that on-line results are considerably affected by the novelty of
users. On-line metrics correlates positively with ranking-based metrics (AUC,
MRR, nDCG) for novice users, while too high values of diversity and novelty had
a negative impact on the on-line results for them. For users with more visited

specifics of the parallel applications, the variety of computing platforms, and
the numerous performance degradation factors, no single loop scheduling
technique can be a 'one-fits-all' solution to effectively optimize the
performance of all parallel applications in all situations. The impact of
irregularity in computational workloads and hardware systems, including
operating system noise, on the performance of parallel applications, results in
performance loss and has often been neglected in loop scheduling research, in
particular, the context of OpenMP schedules. Existing dynamic loop
self-scheduling techniques, such as trapezoid self-scheduling, factoring, and
weighted factoring, offer an unexplored potential to alleviate this degradation
in OpenMP due to the fact that they explicitly target the minimization of load
imbalance and scheduling overhead. Through theoretical and experimental
evaluation, this work shows that these loop self-scheduling methods provide a
benefit in the context of OpenMP. In conclusion, OpenMP must include more

concepts from this field to situations involving quantum systems, resulting in
a new notion of quantum causal structure. A key concept in both the classical
and quantum context is that of an intervention. Interventions are the
controlled operations required to identify causal structure and ultimately the
feature that endows causal models with empirical meaning. Although
interventions are a crucial feature of both the classical and quantum causal
modelling frameworks, to date there has been no discussion of their physical
basis. In this paper, we consider interventions from a physical perspective and
show that, in both the classical and quantum case, they are constrained by the
thermodynamics of measurement and feedback in open systems. We demonstrate that

  in Cologne, Germany",,,,"cs.IR cs.SI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The micro-blogging platform Twitter allows its nearly 320 million monthly
active users to build a network of follower connections to other Twitter users
(i.e., followees) in order to subscribe to content posted by these users. With
this feature, Twitter has become one of the most popular social networks on the
Web and was also the first platform that offered the concept of hashtags.
Hashtags are freely-chosen keywords, which start with the hash character, to
annotate, categorize and contextualize Twitter posts (i.e., tweets).
  Although hashtags are widely accepted and used by the Twitter community, the
heavy reuse of hashtags that are popular in the personal Twitter networks
(i.e., own hashtags and hashtags used by followees) can lead to filter bubble
effects and thus, to situations, in which only content associated with these
hashtags are presented to the user. These filter bubble effects are also highly
associated with the concept of confirmation bias, which is the tendency to
favor and reuse information that confirms personal preferences. One example
would be a Twitter user who is interested in political tweets of US president
Donald Trump. Depending on the hashtags used, the user could either be stuck in
a pro-Trump (e.g., #MAGA) or contra-Trump (e.g., #fakepresident) filter bubble.
Therefore, the goal of this paper is to study confirmation bias and filter
bubble effects in hashtag usage on Twitter by treating the reuse of hashtags as
a phenomenon that fosters confirmation bias.

generated through a 2.5-dimensional (2.5-D) flux-transport model with the
Babcock-Leighton mechanism, and then is used as bottom boundary condition for
compressible 2.5-D simulations of the solar wind. We recover solar values for
the mass loss rate, the spin-down time scale and the Alfv\'en radius, and are
able to reproduce the observed delay in latitudinal variations of the wind and
the general wind structure observed for the Sun. We show that the phase lag
between the energy of the dipole component and the total surface magnetic
energy has a strong influence on the amplitude of the variations of global
quantities. We show in particular that the magnetic torque variations can be
linked to topological variations during a magnetic cycle, while variations in
the mass loss rate appear to be driven by variations of the magnetic energy.

falls as the proximity magnetisation in Pt is reduced, whilst the perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy $K_\mathrm{u}$ rises. The micromagnetic DMI strength $D$
was determined using the bubble expansion technique and also rises from a
negligible value when $x=0$ to $\sim 1$ mJ/m$^2$ for $x = 1$. The depinning
field at which field-driven domain wall motion crosses from the creep to the
depinning regime rises from $\sim 40$ to $\sim 70$ mT, attributed to greater
spatial fluctuations of the domain wall energy with increasing Au
concentration. Meanwhile, the increase in DMI causes the Walker field to rise
from $\sim 10$ to $\sim 280$ mT, meaning that only in the $x = 1$ sample is the
steady flow regime accessible. The full dependence of domain wall velocity on
driving field bears little resemblance to the prediction of a simple
one-dimensional model, but can be described very well using micromagnetic
simulations with a realistic model of disorder. These reveal a rise in Gilbert
damping as $x$ increases.

silence in which an object of arbitrary shape can be acoustically hidden for a

without reflection of the wavefront, which are close to an ideal invisibility
cloak. This kind of cloaking is effective in a wide frequency band and the
cloaking band is a function of the impedance and height of the obstacle

the object to help hide itself, which increases the cloaking frequency band
(self-cloaking). Dispersion effects lead to slow sounds and distortion of the

be exploited to maximize their locomotion performance in a given environment
and used to adapt them to changing conditions. Albeit, because of the lack of
accurate locomotion models, and given the intrinsic variability among
microrobots, analytical control design is not possible. Common data-driven
approaches, on the other hand, require running prohibitive numbers of
experiments and lead to very sample-specific results. Here we propose a
probabilistic learning approach for light-controlled soft microrobots based on
Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Gaussian Processes (GPs). The proposed approach
results in a learning scheme that is data-efficient, enabling gait optimization
with a limited experimental budget, and robust against differences among
microrobot samples. These features are obtained by designing the learning
scheme through the comparison of different GP priors and BO settings on a
semi-synthetic data set. The developed learning scheme is validated in
microrobot experiments, resulting in a 115% improvement in a microrobot's
locomotion performance with an experimental budget of only 20 tests. These
encouraging results lead the way toward self-adaptive microrobotic systems
based on light-controlled soft microrobots and probabilistic learning control.

relaxation rate of the system toward its non-equilibrium steady state. In the
high-density (low-density) phase, the relaxation rate becomes independent of
the injection (extraction) rate, at a certain critical value of the parameter
itself, and this transition is not accompanied by any qualitative change in the
steady-state behavior. We characterize the relaxation rate by providing
rigorous bounds, which become tight in the thermodynamic limit. These results
are generalized to the TASEP with Langmuir kinetics, where particles can also
bind to empty sites or unbind from occupied ones, in the symmetric case of
equal binding/unbinding rates. The theory predicts a dynamical transition to
occur in this case as well.

hyperfine coupling intrinsic to the qubit, or inhomogeneous broadening. The
detuning acts as an additional static field which is generally assumed to be

this is not the case in the presence of finite pulse-durations, where a
detuning can drastically alter the coherence response of the probe qubit, with
important implications for sensing applications. Using the electronic spin

analytically and experimentally study the qubit coherence response under CPMG

For both the optical/UV and X-rays, the amplitude of the variations correlates
with flux, but this correlation is less significant in the optical/UV. The
variability in the light curves may be produced by a complex combination of
processes. Some of the X-ray variability may be due to the presence of a local,
inhomogeneous and dust-free absorber, while variability visible in both the
X-ray and optical/UV may instead be driven by the accretion flow: the X-rays

  Evolution",,,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the nonlinearity of artificial neural networks, designing topologies
for deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) is a challenging task and often
only heuristic approach, such as trial and error, can be applied. An
evolutionary algorithm can solve optimization problems where the fitness
landscape is unknown. However, evolutionary algorithms are computing resource
intensive, which makes it difficult for problems when deep CNNs are involved.
In this paper, we propose an evolutionary strategy to find better topologies
for deep CNNs. Incorporating the concept of knowledge inheritance and knowledge
learning, our evolutionary algorithm can be executed with limited computing
resources. We applied the proposed algorithm in finding effective topologies of
deep CNNs for the image classification task using CIFAR-10 dataset. After the
evolution, we analyzed the topologies that performed well for this task. Our
studies verify the techniques that have been commonly used in human designed
deep CNNs. We also discovered that some of the graph properties greatly affect
the system performance. We applied the guidelines learned from the evolution
and designed new network topologies that outperform Residual Net with less
layers on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN dataset.

proved. As a consequence, lifting of TTF triples is possible for recollements
of stable categories of repetitive algebras or self-injective finite length

derived categories of small linear categories the conditions from the criterion
are sufficient to lift the recollement to a recollement of ambient triangulated

the problem of constructing silting sets in the central category of a
recollement generating the t-structure glued from the silting t-structures in

and {\bf (3)} robustness against colluding parties even in the extreme case

privacy-preserving, achieve the same learning accuracy as SGD and hence retain
the merit of deep learning with respect to accuracy. Finally, we conduct
several experiments using benchmark datasets, and show that our systems

can be analysed for a single run of an experiment using the phase space
trajectory of the system. By contrast, in the quantum regime such energy
exchange processes must be defined for an {\it ensemble} of runs of the same
experiment based on the reduced system density matrix. Single-shot approaches
have been proposed for quantum systems that are weakly coupled to a heat bath.
However, a single-shot analysis for a quantum system that is entangled or
strongly interacting with external degrees of freedom has not been attempted
because no system wave function exists for such a system within the standard
formulation of quantum theory. Using the notion of the {\it conditional} wave
function of a quantum system, we derive here an exact formula for the rate of
total energy change in an open quantum system, valid for arbitrary coupling
between the system and the environment. In particular, this allows us to
identify three distinct contributions to the total energy flow: an external
contribution coming from the explicit time dependence of the Hamiltonian, an
interaction contribution associated with the interaction part of the
Hamiltonian, and an entanglement contribution, directly related to the presence
of entanglement between the system and its environment. Given the close
connection between weak values and the conditional wave function, the approach
presented here provides a new avenue for experimental studies of energy
fluctuations in open quantum systems.

with both non-zero Stern-layer conductance and finite chemical reaction rates.
We have recently studied the same system numerically [Werkhoven {\em et al.},
Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 120}, 264502 (2018)], and have shown that an applied
pressure drop across the surface leads to a non-trivial, laterally
heterogeneous surface charge distribution at steady state. In this work, we
linearise the governing electrokinetic equations to find closed expressions for
the surface charge profile and the generated streaming electric field. The main
results of our calculations are the identification of three important length
and time scales that govern the charge distribution, and consequently the
classification of electrokinetic systems into three distinct regimes. The three
governing time scales can be associated to (i) the chemical reaction, (ii)
diffusion in the Stern layer, and (iii) conduction in the Stern layer, where
the dominating (smallest) time scale characterises the regime. In the
reaction-dominated regime we find a constant surface charge with an edge
effect, and recover the Helmholtz-Smoluchowski equation. In the other two
regimes, we find that the surface charge heterogeneity extends over the entire
surface, either linearly (diffusion-dominated regime) or nonlinearly
(conduction-dominated regime).

and the Boyd, Grinstein and Lebed (BGL) groups, are used to extract the product
$\mathcal{F}(1)\eta_{\rm EW}|V_{cb}|$ and the decay form factors, where
$\mathcal{F}(1)$ is the normalization factor and $\eta_{\rm EW}$ is a small
electroweak correction. In the CLN parameterization we find
$\mathcal{F}(1)\eta_{\rm EW}|V_{cb}| = (35.06 \pm 0.15 \pm 0.56) \times

obtain $\mathcal{F}(1)\eta_{\rm EW}|V_{cb}|= (34.93 \pm 0.23 \pm 0.59)\times

$\mathcal{F}(1)\eta_{\rm EW}$. The branching fraction of $B^{0} \to D^{*-}
\ell^+ \nu_\ell$ is measured to be $\mathcal{B}(B^{0}\rightarrow
D^{*-}\ell^{+}\nu_{\ell}) = (4.90 \pm 0.02 \pm 0.16)\%$. We also present a new
test of lepton flavor universality violation in semileptonic $B$ decays,
$\frac{{\cal B }(B^0 \to D^{*-} e^+ \nu)}{{\cal B }(B^0 \to D^{*-} \mu^+ \nu)}
= 1.01 \pm 0.01 \pm 0.03~$. The errors correspond to the statistical and
systematic uncertainties respectively. This is the most precise measurement of
$\mathcal{F}(1)\eta_{\rm EW}|V_{cb}|$ and form factors to date and the first

impossible to attain higher precision than the bound defined by entropy
production. In statistical inference theory, information inequalities assert
that it is infeasible for any estimator to achieve an error smaller than the
prescribed bound. Inspired by the similarity between the thermodynamic
uncertainty relation and the information inequalities, we apply the latter to
systems described by Langevin equations and derive the bound for the
fluctuation of thermodynamic quantities. When applying the Cram\'er-Rao
inequality, the obtained inequality reduces to the fluctuation-response
inequality. We find that the thermodynamic uncertainty relation is a particular
case of the Cram\'er-Rao inequality, in which the Fisher information is the
total entropy production. Using the equality condition of the Cram\'er-Rao
inequality, we find that the stochastic total entropy production is the only
quantity which can attain equality in the thermodynamic uncertainty relation.
Furthermore, we apply the Chapman-Robbins inequality and obtain a relation for
the lower bound of the ratio between the variance and the sensitivity of
systems in response to arbitrary perturbations.

with Gaussian codebooks and successive decoding, while treating interference
from all other MACs (i.e. inter-cell interference) as noise. We characterize
the generalized degrees-of-freedom (GDoF) region achieved through the proposed
TIN scheme, and then identify conditions under which this achievable region is
convex without the need for time-sharing. We then tighten these convexity
conditions and identify a regime in which the proposed TIN scheme achieves the

ensembles in binary glasses under periodic shear deformation with varied
amplitude. The consideration is given to porous systems in the limit of low
porosity. The initial ensembles of pores are comprised of multiple pores with
small sizes, which are approximately normally distributed. As periodic loading
proceeds, the ensembles evolve into configurations with a few large-scale pores
and significantly reduced number of small pores. These structural changes are
reflected in the skewed shapes of the pore-size distribution functions and the
appearance of a distinct peak at large length scales after hundreds of shear
cycles. Moreover, periodic shear causes substantial densification of solid
domains in the porous systems. The structural evolution of pore ensembles is
found to stem from the formation of shear-band like regions of enhanced
particle mobility after a number of transient cycles. The spatial extent of
increased mobility depends strongly on the strain amplitude. A scaling theory
is developed to qualitatively describe the transformation of the pore initial
configurations of small-size voids into larger-scale void agglomerates.

extra degree of freedom. We thus present a comparison between two physical

the differences between the models by plotting physical properties of clusters

that for 14 of the 16 simulations, the Bayesian evidence gives no preference to

been widely used in many applications such as image and video editing, object
extraction, and photo composition. In this paper, we propose a novel
interactive binary image segmentation method based on the Markov Random Field
(MRF) framework and the fast bilateral solver (FBS) technique. Specifically, we
employ the geodesic distance component to build the unary term. To ensure both
computation efficiency and effective responsiveness for interactive
segmentation, superpixels are used in computing geodesic distances instead of
pixels. Furthermore, we take a bilateral affinity approach for the pairwise
term in order to preserve edge information and denoise. Through the alternating
direction strategy, the MRF energy minimization problem is divided into two
subproblems, which then can be easily solved by steepest gradient descent (SGD)
and FBS respectively. Experimental results on the VGG interactive image
segmentation dataset show that the proposed algorithm outperforms several
state-of-the-art ones, and in particular, it can achieve satisfactory
edge-smooth segmentation results even when the foreground and background color
appearances are quite indistinctive.

for finite square well potential is analyzed in order to obtain bound state

classically equivalent to one another and to the standard Hamiltonian yielding
Newton's equations. Quantum mechanically, however, they are expected to be
differed from each other. The Schr\""{o}dinger's equation coming from each of
NEH with finite square well potential is an infinite order differential
equation. The matching conditions therefore demand the wavefunctions to be
infinitely differentiable at the well boundaries. To handle this, we provide a
way to consistently truncate these conditions. It turns out as expected that
bound state energy spectrum and wavefunctions are dependent on the parameter
$\beta,$ which is used to characterize different NEH. As $\beta\to 0,$ the

most iron-based superconductors (SCs). In contrast to those SCs, the newly
discovered SC CaK(Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_4$As$_4$ exhibits an antiferromagnetic
(AFM) state, called hedgehog spin-vortex crystal structure, without nematic
order, providing the opportunity for the investigation into the relationship
between spin fluctuations and SC without any effects of nematic fluctuations.
Our $^{75}$As nuclear magnetic resonance studies on
CaK(Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_4$As$_4$ (0$\le x\le$ 0.049) revealed that
CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ is located close to a hidden hedgehog SVC AFM quantum-critical
point (QCP). The magnetic QCP without nematicity in
CaK(Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_4$As$_4$ highlights the close connection of spin
fluctuations and superconductivity in iron-based SCs. The advantage of
stoichiometric composition also makes CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ an ideal platform for
further detailed investigation of the relationship between magnetic QCP and
superconductivity in iron-based SCs without disorder effects.

networks that helps to improve the spatial sampling of input data for a given
task. Our differentiable layer can be added as a preprocessing block to
existing task networks and trained altogether in an end-to-end fashion. The
effect of the layer is to efficiently estimate how to sample from the original
data in order to boost task performance. For example, for an image
classification task in which the original data might range in size up to
several megapixels, but where the desired input images to the task network are
much smaller, our layer learns how best to sample from the underlying high
resolution data in a manner which preserves task-relevant information better
than uniform downsampling. This has the effect of creating distorted,
caricature-like intermediate images, in which idiosyncratic elements of the
image that improve task performance are zoomed and exaggerated. Unlike
alternative approaches such as spatial transformer networks, our proposed layer
is inspired by image saliency, computed efficiently from uniformly downsampled
data, and degrades gracefully to a uniform sampling strategy under uncertainty.
We apply our layer to improve existing networks for the tasks of human gaze
estimation and fine-grained object classification. Code for our method is

practical solution methods for discrete optimization problems. In the last
decade, decision diagrams (DDs) have brought a new perspective on obtaining
upper and lower bounds that can be significantly better than classical bounding
mechanisms, such as linear relaxations. It is well known that the quality of
the bounds achieved through this flexible bounding method is highly reliant on
the ordering of variables chosen for building the diagram, and finding an
ordering that optimizes standard metrics is an NP-hard problem. In this paper,
we propose an innovative and generic approach based on deep reinforcement
learning for obtaining an ordering for tightening the bounds obtained with
relaxed and restricted DDs. We apply the approach to both the Maximum
Independent Set Problem and the Maximum Cut Problem. Experimental results on
synthetic instances show that the deep reinforcement learning approach, by
achieving tighter objective function bounds, generally outperforms ordering
methods commonly used in the literature when the distribution of instances is
known. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first paper to apply
machine learning to directly improve relaxation bounds obtained by
general-purpose bounding mechanisms for combinatorial optimization problems.

T*$\sim$220\,K to spin-orbital entangled state which is then followed by a
transition at T$_N$=116\,K to C-type orbital ordered (OO) and G-type
antiferromagnetic ordered (AF) ground state. In the temperature interval
T$_N<T<T^*$, the VO$_{6/2}$ octahedra have two comparable in-plane V-O bonds
which are longer than the out-of-plane V-O1 bond. This local structural
distortion supports the spin-orbital entanglement of partially filled and
degenerate yz/zx orbitals. However, this distortion is incompatible with the
steric octahedral site distortion intrinsic to orthorhombic perovskites. Their
competition induces a second order transition from the spin-orbital entangled
state to C-OO/G-AF ground state where the long range OO suppresses the
spin-orbital entanglement. Our analysis suggests that the spin-orbital
entangled state and G-OO are comparable in energy and compete with each other.
Rare earth site disorder favors the spin-orbital entanglement rather than a
cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion. The results also indicate for LaVO$_3$ a
C-OO/G-AF state in T$_t$\,$\leq$\,T\,$\leq$T$_N$ and an orbital flipping

the matrix exponential is derived. The estimate is based on the defect
(residual) of the Krylov approximation and is proven to constitute a rigorous
upper bound on the error, in contrast to existing asymptotical approximations.
It can be computed economically in the underlying Krylov space. In view of
time-stepping applications, assuming that the given matrix is scaled by a time
step, it is shown that the bound is asymptotically correct (with an order
related to the dimension of the Krylov space) for the time step tending to
zero. This means that the deviation of the error estimate from the true error
tends to zero faster than the error itself. Furthermore, this result is
extended to Krylov approximations of $\varphi$-functions and to improved
versions of such approximations. The accuracy of the derived bounds is
demonstrated by examples and compared with different variants known from the
literature, which are also investigated more closely. Alternative error bounds
are tested on examples, in particular a version based on the concept of

of the CFHTLS-D3 field (Groth Strip). WUDS includes four near-IR bands (Y, J, H

reaches between ~26.8 in Y and J, and ~26 in H and K_s (AB, 3 sigma in 1.3
arcsec aperture). The area and depth of this survey were specifically tailored
to set strong constraints on the cosmic star formation rate and the luminosity
function brighter or around L* in the z~6-10 redshift domain, although these
data are also useful for a variety of extragalactic projects.This first paper
is intended to present the properties of WUDS: catalog building, completeness
and depth, number counts, photometric redshifts, and global properties of the
galaxy population. We have also concentrated on the study of galaxy samples at
z~[4.5-7] in this field. UV luminosity functions were derived at z~5 and z~6
taking advantage from the fact that WUDS covers a particularly interesting
regime at intermediate luminosities, which allows a combined determination of
M* and Phi* with increased accuracy. Our results on the luminosity function are
consistent with a small evolution of both M* and Phi* between z=5 and z=6,
irrespective of the method used to derive them, either photometric redshifts
applied to blindly-selected dropout samples or the classical Lyman Break Galaxy
color-preselected samples. Our results lend support to higher Phi*
determinations at z=6 than usually reported. The selection and combined
analysis of different galaxy samples at z>7 will be presented in a forthcoming

discussions of finetuned cancellations in physical theories. XYCM is then
analyzed from a statistical perspective, where it is argued that a finetuned
point in the parameter space is not abnormal, with any such point being just as
probable as any other point. However, landing inside a standardly defined
finetuned region (i.e., the full parameter space of finetuned points) has a
much lower probability than landing outside the region, and that probability is
invariant under assumed ranges of parameters. This proposition requires
asserting also that the finetuned target region is a priori established.
Therefore, it is surmised that highly finetuned theories are generally expected
to be highly improbable. An actionable implication of this moderate naturalness
position is that the search for a non-finetuned explanation to supplant an
apparently finetuned theory is likely to be a valid pursuit, but not guaranteed
to be. A statistical characterization of this moderate position is presented,
as well as those of the extreme pro-naturalness and anti-naturalness positions.

  note: text overlap with arXiv:1809.03367",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hybrid precoding design can be challenging for broadband millimeter-wave
(mmWave) massive MIMO due to the frequency-flat analog precoder in radio
frequency (RF). Prior broadband hybrid precoding work usually focuses on
fully-connected array (FCA), while seldom considers the energy-efficient
partially-connected subarray (PCS) including the fixed subarray (FS) and
dynamic subarray (DS). Against this background, this paper proposes a machine
learning based broadband hybrid precoding for mmWave massive MIMO with DS.
Specifically, we first propose an optimal hybrid precoder based on principal
component analysis (PCA) for the FS, whereby the frequency-flat RF precoder for
each subarray is extracted from the principle component of the optimal
frequency-selective precoders for fully-digital MIMO. Moreover, we extend the
PCA-based hybrid precoding to DS, where a shared agglomerative hierarchical
clustering (AHC) algorithm developed from machine learning is proposed to group
the DS for improved spectral efficiency (SE). Finally, we investigate the
energy efficiency (EE) of the proposed scheme for both passive and active
antennas. Simulations have confirmed that the proposed scheme outperforms
conventional schemes in both SE and EE.

obstacles and uncertainties, which is a fundamental problem in robotics.
  While many path planning algorithms have been proposed for decades, many of
them have dealt with only deterministic environments or only open-loop
uncertainty, i.e., the uncertainty of the system state is not controlled and,
typically, increases with time due to exogenous disturbances, which leads to
the design of potentially conservative nominal paths.
  In order to deal with disturbances and reduce uncertainty, generally, a
lower-level feedback controller is used.
  We conjecture that, if a path planner can consider the closed-loop evolution
of the system uncertainty, it can compute less conservative but still feasible
paths.
  To this end, in this work we develop a new approach that is based on optimal
covariance steering, which explicitly steers the state covariance for
stochastic linear systems with additive noise under non-convex state chance
constraints.
  The proposed framework is verified using simple numerical simulations.

effective theory where the expansion parameter is the inverse quark mass,
1/$M$. At leading order in 1/$M$ (and neglecting light quark masses) the
dependence of any low energy quantity on $M$ is given in terms of the ratio of
$\Lambda$ parameters of the effective and the fundamental theory. We define a
function describing the scaling with the mass $M$. We find that its
perturbative expansion is very reliable for the bottom quark and also seems to
work very well at the charm quark mass. The same is then true for the ratios of
$\Lambda^{(4)}/\Lambda^{(5)}$ and $\Lambda^{(3)}/\Lambda^{(4)}$, which play a
major r\^ole in connecting lattice determinations of $\alpha^{(3)}_{MSbar}$
from the three-flavor theory with $\alpha^{(5)}_{MSbar}(M_Z)$. Also the charm
quark content of the nucleon, relevant for dark matter searches, can be
computed accurately from perturbation theory.
  We investigate a very closely related model, namely QCD with $N_f=2$ heavy
quarks. Our non-perturbative information is derived from simulations on the
lattice, with masses up to the charm quark mass and lattice spacings down to
about 0.023 fm followed by a continuum extrapolation. The non-perturbative mass
dependence agrees within rather small errors with the perturbative prediction
at masses around the charm quark mass. Surprisingly, from studying solely the
massive theory we can make a prediction for the ratio
$Q^{1/\sqrt{t_0}}_{0,2}=[\Lambda \sqrt{t_0(0)}]_{N_f=2}/[\Lambda
\sqrt{t_0}]_{N_f=0}$, which refers to the chiral limit in $N_f=2$. Here $t_0$
is the Gradient Flow scale of [1]. The uncertainty for $Q$ is estimated to be
2.5%. For the phenomenologically interesting $\Lambda^{(3)}/\Lambda^{(4)}$, we
conclude that perturbation theory introduces errors which are at most at the
1.5% level, far smaller than other current uncertainties.

large-scale field theory simulations of the simplest model containing these

approaches scaling, i.e. that it remains a constant fraction of the background
energy density. The number of monopoles per unit comoving string length is
constant, meaning that the density fraction of monopoles decreases with time.
Where the necklaces carry semipoles rather than monopoles, we perform the first
simulations large enough to demonstrate that they also maintain a constant
number per unit comoving string length. We also compare our results to a number
of analytical models of cosmic necklaces, finding that none explains our

controlled by a diffusive process, a possibility not considered before. The
observational constraints derived in our previous work for necklaces with
monopoles can now be safely applied to those with semipoles as well.

accurate segmentation and classification of heart sound (HS) signals. Methods:
We propose an approach based on Markov switching autoregressive model (MSAR) to
segmenting the HS into four fundamental components each with distinct
second-order structure. The identified boundaries are then utilized for
automated classification of pathological HS using the continuous density hidden
Markov model (CD-HMM). The MSAR formulated in a state-space form is able to
capture simultaneously both the continuous hidden dynamics in HS, and the
regime switching in the dynamics using a discrete Markov chain. This overcomes
the limitation of HMM which uses a single-layer of discrete states. We
introduce three schemes for model estimation: (1.) switching Kalman filter
(SKF); (2.) refined SKF; (3.) fusion of SKF and the duration-dependent Viterbi
algorithm (SKF-Viterbi). Results: The proposed methods are evaluated on
Physionet/CinC Challenge 2016 database. The SKF-Viterbi significantly
outperforms SKF by improvement of segmentation accuracy from 71% to 84.2%. The
use of CD-HMM as a classifier and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)
as features can characterize not only the normal and abnormal morphologies of
HS signals but also morphologies considered as unclassifiable (denoted as
X-Factor). It gives classification rates with best gross F1 score of 90.19
(without X-Factor) and 82.7 (with X-Factor) for abnormal beats. Conclusion: The
proposed MSAR approach for automatic localization and detection of pathological
HS shows a noticeable performance on large HS dataset. Significance: It has
potential applications in heart monitoring systems to assist cardiologists for
pre-screening of heart pathologies.

technique for adaptive streaming over the Internet. Still considered as its
primary challenges are determining the optimal rate adaptation and improving
both the quality of experience (QoE) and QoE-fairness. Most of the proposed
approaches have relied on local information to find a result. However,
employing techniques that provide a comprehensive and central view of the
network resources can lead to more gains in performance. By leveraging software
defined networking (SDN), this paper proposes an SDN-based framework, named
S2VC, to maximize QoE metrics and QoE-fairness in SVC-based HTTP adaptive
streaming. The proposed framework determines both the optimal adaptation and
data paths for delivering the requested video files from HTTP-media servers to
DASH clients. In fact, by utilizing an SDN controller and its complete view of
the network, we introduce an SVC flow optimizer (SFO) application module to
determine the optimal solution in a centralized and time slot fashion. In the
current approach, we first formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear
programming (MILP) optimization model. The MILP is designed in such a way that
it applies defined policies, e.g. setting priorities for clients in obtaining
video quality. Secondly, we show that this problem is NP-complete and propose
an LP-relaxation model to enable S2VC framework for performing rate adaptation
on a large-scale network. Finally, we conduct experiments by emulating the
proposed framework in Mininet, with the usage of Floodlight as the SDN
controller. In terms of improving QoE-fairness and QoE metrics, the
effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated by a comparison with
different approaches.

aims to move all resonances concurrently. These resonances are in one-to-one
correspondence with fixed points of symplectic maps, which in turn are in a
one-to-one correspondence with the critical points of their generating

boils down to an approximation problem: given a generating function,
approximate it by a function whose critical points are outside a specified

employed stable polynomials. Many stable polynomials have a determinantal

space-time trade-off methods, representing a joining link between punctual and

correction due to the presence of growing vegetation beneath the detector
position. The gamma signal attenuation due to biomass is modelled with a Monte
Carlo-based approach in terms of an equivalent water layer which thickness
varies in time as the crop evolves during its life-cycle. The reliability and
effectiveness of this approach is proved through a 7 months continuous
acquisition of terrestrial gamma radiation in a 0.4 ha tomato (Solanum

installed at an agricultural field can reliably probe the water content of the
top soil only if systematic effects due to the biomass shielding are properly
accounted for. Biomass corrected experimental values of soil water content
inferred from radiometric measurements are compared with gravimetric data
acquired under different soil moisture levels, resulting in an average

significantly affect the stiffness of the equation of state and acceptable
neutron star masses result. Interestingly, for the most plausible value of the

quadratic dispersion relation. In this work, we consider systems exhibiting
linear dispersion relation, particularly photons and phonons, and calculate the
related density and number of states (NOS). Also, a Weyl's conjecture-based DOS
function is calculated for photons and phonons by considering the bounded

of bounded and unbounded continua in the appropriate limits. The fluctuations
in discrete DOS completely disappear under accumulation operators. It's
interesting that relative errors of NOS and DOS functions with respect to
discrete ones are exactly the same as the ones for quadratic dispersion
relation. Furthermore, the application of discrete and Weyl DOS for the
calculation of internal energy of a photon gas is presented and importance of
discrete DOS is discussed. It's shown that discrete DOS function given in this

have been used. We present results from both datasets of retrotransposons
(SINE1s) of E. histolytica. We have calculated the mutation rate of EhSINE1s
for both datasets and drawn a phylogenetic tree for newly determined EhSINE1s
(dataset II). We have also discussed the variation in lengths of EhSINE1s for
both datasets. Using the quasispecies model, we have shown how sequences of
SINE1s vary within the population. The outputs of the quasispecies model are
discussed in the presence and the absence of back mutation by taking different
values of fitness. From our study of Non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons
(LINEs and their non-autonomous partner's SINEs) of Entamoeba histolytica, we
can conclude that an active EhSINE can generate very similar copies of itself
by retrotransposition. Due to this reason, it increases mutations which give
the result of sequence polymorphism. We have concluded that the mutation rate
of SINE is very high. This high mutation rate provides an idea for the
existence of SINEs, which may affect the genetic analysis of EhSINE1
ancestries, and calculation of phylogenetic distances.

against the disease. The stochastic malaria models are improved by including
the random environmental fluctuations in the disease transmission and natural

of earth sciences over the past decade necessitates the development of robust
yet simple algorithms that can tackle the various drawbacks of in silico models
developed hitherto. One such drawback is that of the restrictive computational
cost of finite element method in rendering resolutions to the fine scale
features, while at the same time keeping the domain being modeled sufficiently
large. We propose the use of the augmented lagrangian method commonly used in
the treatment of hanging nodes in contact mechanics in tackling the drawback.
An interface is introduced in a typical finite element mesh across which an
aggressive coarsening of the finite elements is possible. The method is based
upon minimizing an augmented potential energy which factors in the constraint
that exists at the hanging nodes on that interface. This allows for a
significant reduction in the number of finite elements comprising the mesh with
concomitant reduction in the computational expense.

masses are on the rough order of $10^{-22}$ eV. Since the occupation numbers
are huge, the state is coherent, and the speeds typical of orbital velocities
in halos, it has generally been assumed that a classical effective
non-relativistic treatment is adequate. However, the Compton wavelength would
be $\sim 1\, {\rm pc}$, and around the Compton scale concerns about some
aspects of quantum measurement theory, known in principle but not
quantitatively significant in previous cases, become pronounced. I estimate
here the stress--energy operator, averaged over a few Compton wavelengths; a
rough but useful approximation has a remarkably simple form. Conventional
quantum measurement theory gives physically unacceptable results: a
thought-experiment to measure the stress--energy is described which would
involve only a modest apparatus but would excite particles in the observation
volume to relativistic energies; these particles would escape the Galaxy, and
there would be a substantial violation of energy conservation. Related
foundational questions come up: the meaning of measurements of observables with
continuous spectra, and the problem of predicting when measurements occur. The
effective classical theory of fuzzy dark matter is not affected; however, the
underlying quantum theory cannot be regarded as satisfactory without resolving
these issues. But we may interpret the results more broadly. The macroscopic
Compton scale amplifies inadequacies of measurement theory which have not
previously seemed pressing.

third order quasi-topological black holes coupled to a power-law Maxwell
nonlinear electrodynamics. To have real solutions, we should establish
condition $\mu<-\frac{\lambda^2}{3}$ and to have finite solutions at infinity,
the parameter of power-law Maxwell theory ""s"" should obey $\frac{1}{2}<s\leq
2$. Power-law Maxwell lagrangian is successful to set conformal invariance in
higher dimensions. Also, this theory can reduce the divergence of the
electrical field at the origin that is caused in linear Maxwell theory. As the
value of parameter ""s"" increases, this divergence reduces more. In
asymptotically anti-de sitter spacetimes, these obtained solutions lead to a
black hole with two horizons for small values of $s$ and $q$. Also, solutions
for $s=2$ have different behaviors with respect to the ones for other values of
$s$. For negative and small values of parameter $\mu$, these solutions can
describe a black hole with two horizons. An other important tip is that this
black hole has thermal stability just for anti-de sitter solutions if its
temperature is positive.

interaction critically decided by the distribution density of PNPs over the
semiconductor surface which is not entirely understood. Here, a systematic
study depicting how the interparticle gap between Silver (Ag) NPs influences
the performance of the \b{eta}-Ga2O3 based solar-blind photodetector.
Interestingly, a remarkable transition is observed, where the varied
interparticle gap not only changes the polarity but also reverses the
traditional photodetector behaviour. The positive transient response of bare
\b{eta}-Ga2O3 photodetector with feeble DUV light switches its behaviour
remarkably to 20 times enhance negative-photoresponse when decorated by
sparsely-spaced Ag-PNPs with ultra-high responsivity of 107.47 A/W at moderate
power and an incredible report-highest responsivity of 4.29 mA/W on single
semiconducting \b{eta}-Ga2O3 layer at self-powered mode. Moreover, as the
density of the Ag-PNPs was further increased, the photocurrent decreases with
illumination which dynamically reverses the traditional photodetector to
unnatural anomalous effect. In particular, our study represents the first
demonstration of plasmonic tuning effect to two active dynamic switching modes;
i.e. reverse switchable and anomalous behaviour, the fundamentals of which have
not studied experimentally yet. Finally, we propose a unified well-explained
model to rationalize all observed experimental trends while set-up fundamental
basis for establishing potential applications.

on mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets). Given its pervasive usage,
the compromise of pattern lock could lead to serious consequences. Several
attacks have been constructed to crack the lock. However, these approaches
require the attackers to either be physically close to the target device or be
able to manipulate the network facilities (e.g., WiFi hotspots) used by the
victims. Therefore, the effectiveness of the attacks is significantly impacted
by the environment of mobile devices. Also, these attacks are not scalable
since they cannot easily infer unlock patterns of a large number of devices.
  Motivated by an observation that fingertip motions on the screen of a mobile
device can be captured by analyzing surrounding acoustic signals on it, we
propose PatternListener, a novel acoustic attack that cracks pattern lock by
analyzing imperceptible acoustic signals reflected by the fingertip. It
leverages speakers and microphones of the victim's device to play imperceptible
audio and record the acoustic signals reflected by the fingertip. In
particular, it infers each unlock pattern by analyzing individual lines that
compose the pattern and are the trajectories of the fingertip. We propose
several algorithms to construct signal segments according to the captured
signals for each line and infer possible candidates of each individual line
according to the signal segments. Finally, we map all line candidates into grid
patterns and thereby obtain the candidates of the entire unlock pattern. We
implement a PatternListener prototype by using off-the-shelf smartphones and
thoroughly evaluate it using 130 unique patterns. The real experimental results
demonstrate that PatternListener can successfully exploit over 90% patterns
within five attempts.

linear temporal logics for specifying quantitative timing context-free
requirements in a pointwise semantics setting: Event-Clock Nested Temporal
Logic (EC_NTL) and Nested Metric Temporal Logic (NMTL). The logic EC_NTL is an
extension of both the logic CaRet (a context-free extension of standard LTL)

to the class of Event-Clock automata). We prove that satisfiability of EC_NTL
and visibly model-checking of Visibly Pushdown Timed Automata (VPTA) against
EC_NTL are decidable and EXPTIME-complete. The other proposed logic NMTL is a
context-free extension of standard Metric Temporal Logic (MTL). It is well
known that satisfiability of future MTL is undecidable when interpreted over
infinite timed words but decidable over finite timed words. On the other hand,
we show that by augmenting future MTL with future context-free temporal
operators, the satisfiability problem turns out to be undecidable also for
finite timed words. On the positive side, we devise a meaningful and decidable
fragment of the logic NMTL which is expressively equivalent to EC_NTL and for
