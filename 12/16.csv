  Detection",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In saliency detection, every pixel needs contextual information to make
saliency prediction. Previous models usually incorporate contexts holistically.
However, for each pixel, usually only part of its context region is useful and
contributes to its prediction, while some other part may serve as noises and
distractions. In this paper, we propose a novel pixel-wise contextual attention
network, \ie PiCANet, to learn to selectively attend to informative context
locations at each pixel. Specifically, PiCANet generates an attention map over
the context region of each pixel, where each attention weight corresponds to
the relevance of a context location w.r.t the referred pixel. Then, attentive
contextual features can be constructed via selectively incorporating the
features of useful context locations with the learned attention. We propose
three specific formulations of the PiCANet via embedding the pixel-wise
contextual attention mechanism into the pooling and convolution operations with
attending to global or local contexts. All the three models are fully
differentiable and can be integrated with CNNs with joint training. We
introduce the proposed PiCANets into a U-Net architecture for salient object
detection. Experimental results indicate that the proposed PiCANets can
significantly improve the saliency detection performance. The generated global
and local attention can learn to incorporate global contrast and smoothness,
respectively, which help localize salient objects more accurately and highlight
them more uniformly. Consequently, our saliency model performs favorably
against other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we also validate that
PiCANets can also improve semantic segmentation and object detection
performances, which further demonstrates their effectiveness and generalization
ability.

phenomena in physics, biology and economics. These models typically rest on the
premise that the oscillators are weakly coupled, meaning that amplitudes can be
assumed to be constant and dynamics can therefore be described purely in terms
of phase differences. Whilst mathematically convenient, the restrictive nature
of the weak coupling assumption can limit the explanatory power of these
phase-coupled oscillator models. We therefore propose an extension to the
weakly-coupled oscillator model that incorporates both amplitude and phase as
dependent variables. We use the bilinear neuronal state equations of dynamic
causal modelling as a foundation in deriving coupled differential equations
that describe the activity of both weakly and strongly coupled oscillators. We
show that weakly-coupled oscillator models are inadequate in describing the
processes underlying the temporally variable signals observed in a variety of
systems. We demonstrate that phase-coupled models perform well on simulations
of weakly coupled systems but fail when connectivity is no longer weak. On the
other hand, using Bayesian model selection, we show that our phase-amplitude
coupling model can describe non-weakly coupled systems more effectively despite
the added complexity associated with using amplitude as an extra dependent
variable. We demonstrate the advantage of our phase-amplitude model in the

Based on the same philosophy, this paper introduces a decentralized quantile

the likelihood that other agent exploration and policy changes are occurring,
essentially utilizing the agent's own estimations to weigh the learning rate

of calculating differences of our return distribution representations and
methods for utilizing it to guide updates. We also explore the effect of
risk-seeking strategies for adjusting learning over time and propose adaptive
risk distortion functions which guides risk sensitivity. Our experiments, on

assuming the temperature-dependence of $\sigma$ adds a bias to the analysis.
Nonetheless, this practice is common because an analytical solution of the

multiplication parallel computing, few of them address the problem on

heterogeneous processor platforms to find the optimal schedule that balances
the load within the heterogeneous processor set while minimizing the amount of
communication. A great many studies are based on rectangular partition, whereas
the optimality of rectangular partition as the basis has not been well
justified. In this paper, we propose a new method that schedules matrix
multiplication on heterogeneous processor platforms with the mixed co-design
goal of minimizing the total communication volume and the multiplication
completion time. We first present the schema of our layer based partition (LBP)
method. Subsequently, we demonstrate that our approach guarantees minimal
communication volume, which is smaller than what rectangular partition can
reach. We further analyze the problem of minimizing the task completion time,
with network topologies taken into account. We solve this problem in both

single-neighbor network cases, we propose an equality based method to solve
LBP, and simulation shows that the total communication volume is reduced by 75%
from the lower bound of rectangular partition. In multi-neighbor network cases,
we formulate LBP as a Mixed Integer Programming problem, and reduce the total
communication volume by 81% through simulation. To summarize, this is a
promising perspective of tackling matrix multiplication problems on

physical, chemical, and biological systems, and have been shown to be robust
against random perturbations. How do chimera states achieve their robustness?
We uncover a self-adaptation behavior by which, upon a spatially localized
perturbation, the coherent component of the chimera state spontaneously drifts
to an optimal location as far away from the perturbation as possible, exposing
only its incoherent component to the perturbation to minimize the disturbance.
A systematic numerical analysis of the evolution of the spatiotemporal pattern
of the chimera state towards the optimal stable state reveals an exponential
relaxation process independent of the spatial location of the perturbation,
implying that its effects can be modeled as restoring and damping forces in a
mechanical system and enabling the articulation of a phenomenological model.
Not only is the model able to reproduce the numerical results, it can also
predict the trajectory of drifting. Our finding is striking as it reveals that,
inherently, chimera states possess a kind of ""intelligence"" in achieving
robustness through self adaptation. The behavior can be exploited for
controlled generation of chimera states with their coherent component placed in
any desired spatial region of the system.

first cosmic neutrino source TXS 0506+056 is studied using the data observed by
Fermi-LAT and Swift UVOT/XRT. This source was in a flaring state in the
considered bands before and after the neutrino observations in 2014-2015,
characterized by hard emission spectra in the X-ray and $\gamma$-ray bands,
$1.5-1.8$ and $\leq2.0$, respectively. During the neutrino observations, the
$\gamma$-ray spectrum shows a deviation from a simple power-law shape,
indicating a spectral cutoff at $E_c =8.50\pm2.06$ GeV. The spectral energy
distributions of PKS 0502+049 are modeled within a one-zone leptonic scenario
assuming that high energy $\gamma$-ray emission is produced either by IC
scattering of synchrotron or dusty torus photons by the electron population
that produce the radio-to-optical emission. Alternatively, the observed
$\gamma$-rays are modeled considering inelastic interaction of protons, when
the jet interacts with a dense gaseous target. During the neutrino
observations, the $\gamma$-ray data are best described when the proton energy
distribution is $E_p^{-2.61}$ and if the protons are effectively accelerated up
to 10 PeV, the expected neutrino rate is $\sim1.1$ events within 110 days. In
principle, if the $\gamma$-ray emission with a hard photon index observed
during the flaring periods extends up to TeV, the expected rate can be somewhat
higher, but such conditions are hardly possible. Within the hadronic
interpretation, the $\gamma$-ray data can be reproduced only when the accretion
rate of PKS 0502+049 is in the supper-Eddington regime, as opposed to the
leptonic scenario. From the point of view of the necessary energetics as well
as considering that the required parameters are physically reasonable, when the
neutrinos were observed, the broadband emission from PKS 0502+049 is most
likely of a leptonic origin.

gravitational waves emitted from extreme mass ratio inspirals of stellar-mass
compact objects into supermassive black holes. It is natural to expect that the
spin of the compact object and cosmological constant will affect the orbit of
the inspiral process and hence lead to the considerable phase shift of the
corresponding gravitational waves. In this paper, we investigate the motion of
a spinning test particle in the spinning black hole background with a
cosmological constant and give the order of motion deviation induced by the
particle's spin and the cosmological constant by considering the corresponding
innermost stable circular orbit. By taking the neutron star or kerr black hole
as the small body, the deviations of the innermost stable circular orbit
parameters induced by the particle's spin and cosmological constant are given.
Our results show that the deviation induced by particle's spin is much larger
than that induced by cosmological constant when the test particle locates not
very far away from the black hole, the accumulation of phase shift during the
inspiral from the cosmological constant can be ignored when compared to the one
induced by the particle's spin. However when the test particle locates very far
away from the black hole, the impact from the cosmological constant will
increase dramatically. Therefore the accumulation of phase shift for the whole
process of inspiral induced by the cosmological constant and the particle's
spin should be handled with caution.

accelerated inexact proximal point (QP-AIPP) method proposed earlier by the

nonconvex composite optimization problems using a quadratic penalty approach
where the generated penalized subproblems are solved by a variant of the
underlying AIPP method. The variant, in turn, solves a given penalized
subproblem by generating a sequence of proximal subproblems which are then
solved by an accelerated composite gradient algorithm. The main difference
between AIPP and its variant is that the proximal subproblems in the former are
always convex while the ones in the latter are not necessarily convex due to
the fact that their prox parameters are chosen as aggressively as possible so
as to improve efficiency. The possibly nonconvex proximal subproblems generated
by the AIPP variant are also tentatively solved by a novel adaptive accelerated
composite gradient algorithm based on the validity of some key convergence
inequalities. As a result, the variant generates a sequence of proximal
subproblems where the stepsizes are adaptively changed according to the
responses obtained from the calls to the accelerated composite gradient
algorithm. Finally, numerical results are given to demonstrate the efficiency

window/electrode in solar cells and LEDs. The functionality of In2O3 would be
greatly extended if p-type conductivity could also be achieved. Using
electronic structure calculations, we show that adding Bi to In2O3, in the form
of dilute (In_{1-x}Bi_{x})_2O3} alloys, leads to a new valence band that is
sufficiently higher in energy than the original O-2p valence band to allow for
p-type doping. Moreover, the raised valence band in the (In_{1-x}Bi_{x})_2O3}
dilute alloys leads to strong optical absorption in the visible spectrum,
opening up for new applications such as a wide band gap absorber layer in
tandem solar cells.

combinatorial search algorithm, called Safe Interval Path Planning with

advanced data structure that allows for fast updates and lookups of the current
paths of all agents in an online setting. The resulting MAPD algorithm
TP-SIPPwRT takes kinematic constraints of real robots into account directly
during planning, computes continuous agent movements with given velocities that
work on non-holonomic robots rather than discrete agent movements with uniform
velocity, and is complete for well-formed MAPD instances. We demonstrate its
benefits for automated warehouses using both an agent simulator and a standard
robot simulator. For example, we demonstrate that it can compute paths for
hundreds of agents and thousands of tasks in seconds and is more efficient and
effective than existing MAPD algorithms that use a post-processing step to
adapt their paths to continuous agent movements with given velocities.

$V$ with central charges 8 and 16, such that the spaces of characters is
3-dimensional and the characters forms a basis of the solution space of a third
order monic modular linear differential equation with rational indicial roots.
  Assuming a mild arithmetic condition, we show that the space of characters of

associated with integral lattices $\sqrt{2}E_8$ or the affine vertex operator
algebra of type $D_{20}^{(1)}$ for $c=8$, and the Barnes--Wall lattice
$\Lambda_{16}$, the affine vertex operator algebras of type $D_{16}^{(1)}$ with
level 1 and type $D_{28}^{(1)}$ with level 1 for $c=16$. (The central charge of
the affine vertex operator algebra of type $D_{28}^{(1)}$ with level 1 is 28,

  Supposing a mild condition on characters of $V$, then it uniquely determines

the Barnes--Wall lattice $\Lambda_{16}$, respectively.
  The reason why vertex operator algebras with central charges 8 and 16 are
intensively studied is that there are solutions which do not depend on extra

using the hypergeometric function $3F2$. Hence we cannot apply our standard
method to classify vertex operator algebras in which we are interested.

direct observation of these drumhead surface states in the currently realized

SrAs3 is found to show the presence of a topological nodal-loop, while CaAs3 is

envision the potential limits of deep learning. This paper gives a first set of
results proving that certain deep learning algorithms fail at learning certain
efficiently learnable functions. The results put forward a notion of
cross-predictability that characterizes when such failures take place. Parity
functions provide an extreme example with a cross-predictability that decays
exponentially, while a mere super-polynomial decay of the cross-predictability
is shown to be sufficient to obtain failures. Examples in community detection
and arithmetic learning are also discussed.
  Recall that it is known that the class of neural networks (NNs) with
polynomial network size can express any function that can be implemented in
polynomial time, and that their sample complexity scales polynomially with the
network size. The challenge is with the optimization error (the ERM is
NP-hard), and the success behind deep learning is to train deep NNs with
descent algorithms. The failures shown in this paper apply to training
poly-size NNs on function distributions of low cross-predictability with a
descent algorithm that is either run with limited memory per sample or that is
initialized and run with enough randomness. We further claim that such types of
constraints are necessary to obtain failures, in that exact SGD with careful
non-random initialization can be shown to learn parities. The
cross-predictability in our results plays a similar role the statistical
dimension in statistical query (SQ) algorithms, with distinctions explained in
the paper. The proof techniques are based on exhibiting algorithmic constraints
that imply a statistical indistinguishability between the algorithm's output on
the test model v.s.\ a null model, using information measures to bound the

photometry for 254 cluster (omega Cen, M4) and field RR Lyrae (RRL) variables.
We ended up with more than 551,000 measurements. For 94 fundamental (RRab) and
51 first overtones (RRc) we provide a complete optical/NIR characterization
(mean magnitudes, luminosity amplitudes, epoch of the anchor point). The NIR
light curves of these variables were adopted to provide new and accurate
light-curve templates for both RRc (single period bin) and RRab (three period
bins) variables. The templates for the J and the H band are newly introduced,
together with the use of the pulsation period to discriminate among the
different RRab templates. To overcome subtle uncertainties in the fit of
secondary features of the light curves we provide two independent sets of
analytical functions (Fourier series, Periodic Gaussian functions). The new
templates were validated by using 26 omega Cen and Bulge RRLs covering the four
period bins. We found that the difference between the measured mean magnitude
along the light curve and the mean magnitude estimated by using the template on
a single randomly extracted phase point is better than 0.01 mag (sigma=0.04
mag). We also validated the template on variables for which at least three
phase points were available, but without information on the phase of the anchor
point. The accuracy of the mean magnitudes is ~0.01 mag (sigma=0.04 mag). The
new templates were applied to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) globular
Reticulum and by using literature data and predicted PLZ relations we found
true distance moduli of 18.47+-0.10+-0.03 mag (J) and 18.49+-0.09+-0.05 mag
(K). We also used literature optical and mid-infrared data and we found a mean
true distance modulus of 18.47+-0.02+-0.06 mag, suggesting that Reticulum is ~1
kpc closer than the LMC.

those of the single fluid description for the entropy behavior. We also find
that the model admits a genuine big rip singularity when the dark energy

the cosmological fluid can emulate ordinary matter and the coincidence

as a result, must buffer large amounts of data on each array access to keep
chip costs low. Unfortunately, system-level trends such as increased memory
contention in multi-core architectures and data mapping schemes that improve
memory parallelism may cause only a small amount of the buffered data to be
accessed. This makes buffering large amounts of data on every memory array
access energy-inefficient.
  Emerging non-volatile memories (NVMs) such as PCM, STT-RAM, and RRAM,
however, do not have destructive read operations, opening up opportunities for
employing small row buffers without incurring additional area penalty and/or
design complexity.
  In this work, we discuss architectural changes to enable small row buffers at
a low cost in NVMs. We provide a memory access protocol, energy model, and
timing model to enable further system-level evaluation. We evaluate the
system-level tradeoffs of employing different row buffer sizes in NVM main
memories in terms of energy, performance, and endurance, with different data
mapping schemes. We find that on a multi-core CMP system, reducing the row
buffer size can greatly reduce main memory dynamic energy compared to a DRAM
baseline with large row sizes, without greatly affecting endurance, and for
some memories, leads to improved performance.

high-quality results in single-image super-resolution (SR). DCNNs often suffer
from over-parametrization and large amounts of redundancy, which results in
inefficient inference and high memory usage, preventing massive applications on
mobile devices. As a way to significantly reduce model size and computation
time, binarized neural network has only been shown to excel on semantic-level
tasks such as image classification and recognition. However, little effort of
network quantization has been spent on image enhancement tasks like SR, as
network quantization is usually assumed to sacrifice pixel-level accuracy. In
this work, we explore an network-binarization approach for SR tasks without
sacrificing much reconstruction accuracy. To achieve this, we binarize the
convolutional filters in only residual blocks, and adopt a learnable weight for
each binary filter. We evaluate this idea on several state-of-the-art
DCNN-based architectures, and show that binarized SR networks achieve
comparable qualitative and quantitative results as their real-weight

the pull and pull search (PPS) mechanism to deal with constraints, while the
bottom sub-population use the superiority of feasible solutions (SF) technique
to deal with constraints. In the top sub-population, the search process is
divided into two different stages --- push and pull stages.An adaptive DE
variant with three trial vector generation strategies is employed in the
proposed PPS-DE. In the top sub-population, all the three trial vector
generation strategies are used to generate offsprings, just like in CoDE. In
the bottom sub-population, a strategy adaptation, in which the trial vector
generation strategies are periodically self-adapted by learning from their
experiences in generating promising solutions in the top sub-population, is
used to choose a suitable trial vector generation strategy to generate one
offspring. Furthermore, a parameter adaptation strategy from LSHADE44 is
employed in both sup-populations to generate scale factor $F$ and crossover
rate $CR$ for each trial vector generation strategy. Twenty-eight CSOPs with
10-, 30-, and 50-dimensional decision variables provided in the CEC2018

TET-GAN to efficiently extend to a new text style via one-shot learning where

spontaneously breaks the time-reversal symmetry and removes the QBTP, rendering
the system into a quantum anomalous Hall insulator (QAHI). The first-order
topological nature of QAHI is characterized by a nontrivial Chern number and
supports ($d-1$)-dimensional chiral edge modes. With increasing the interaction
$U$, the system is driven into a Dirac semimetal by breaking the crystal
symmetry through a discontinuous quantum phase transition. The emergent Dirac
points each with Berry flux $\pi$ are generated in pairs, originating from the
$2\pi$ Berry flux of QBTP. A sufficiently large $U$ ultimately drives the
system into a dimerized insulator (DI) by simultaneously annihilating the Dirac
points at the Brillouin zone boundary. The second-order topological nature of
DI is characterized by the quantized polarizations and supports

separation, there are still two major drawbacks, i.e., the high computational
complexity and unsatisfactory source classification accuracy. To overcome these
drawbacks, the proposed method employs an auxiliary classifier VAE, an
information-theoretic extension of the conditional VAE, for learning the
generative model of the source spectrograms. Furthermore, with the trained
auxiliary classifier, we introduce a novel algorithm for the optimization that
is able to not only reduce the computational time but also improve the source
classification performance. We call the proposed method ""fast MVAE (fMVAE)"".
Experimental evaluations revealed that fMVAE achieved comparative source
separation performance to MVAE and about 80% source classification accuracy
rate while it reduced about 93% computational time.

problem, where the distributions that generate the training and test data

large range of practical applications, and is related to the more general

optimization techniques that are specific to an algorithm or practical use case

provide general bounds seems to suggest that efficient learning even under
strong assumptions is not possible for covariate shift. Our main contribution
is to recontextualize these results by showing that any Probably Approximately

shift conditions with only a polynomial increase in the number of training
samples. This approach essentially demonstrates that the Domain Adaptation

soft materials to maintain robustness under cyclic mechanical loads. Whereas
hydrogels have been made tough to resist fracture under a single cycle of

multiple cycles of loads. The reported fatigue threshold (i.e., the minimal
fracture energy at which crack propagation occurs under cyclic loads) for
synthetic hydrogels is on the order of 1-100 J/m2, which is primarily
associated with the energy required to fracture a single layer of polymer
chains per unit area. Here, we demonstrate that the controlled introduction of
crystallinity in hydrogels can significantly enhance their fatigue thresholds,
since the process of fracturing crystalline domains for fatigue-crack
propagation requires much higher energy than fracturing a single layer of
polymer chains. The fatigue threshold of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with a
crystallinity of 18.9 wt.% in the swollen state can exceed 1,000 J/m2. We
further develop a strategy to enhance the anti-fatigue-fracture properties of
PVA hydrogels, but still maintain their high water contents and low moduli by
patterning highly-crystalline regions in the hydrogels. The current work not

convergence for the implicit DOM based on the stationary phonon BTE. The key
innovative point of the present scheme is the introduction of the macroscopic
synthetic diffusion equation for the temperature, which is obtained from the
zero- and first-order moment equations of the phonon BTE. The synthetic
diffusion equation, which is asymptomatically preserving to the Fourier's heat
conduction equation in the diffusive regime, contains a term related to the
Fourier's law and a term determined by the second-order moment of the
distribution function that reflects the non-Fourier heat transfer. The
mesoscopic kinetic equation and macroscopic diffusion equations are tightly
coupled together, because the diffusion equation provides the temperature for
the BTE, while the BTE provides the high-order moment to the diffusion equation
to describe the non-Fourier heat transfer. This synthetic iterative scheme
strengthens the coupling of all phonons in the phase space to facilitate the
fast convergence from the diffusive to ballistic regimes. Typical numerical
tests in one-, two-, and three-dimensional problems demonstrate that our scheme
can describe the multiscale heat transfer problems accurately and efficiently.
For all test cases convergence is reached within one hundred iteration steps,
which is one to three orders of magnitude faster than the traditional implicit
DOM in the near-diffusive regime.

Classification is efficient due to dynamic selection (4-class vs. 64-class

research with many real-world applications. It aims to encode the entities and
relations in the graph into low dimensional vector space, which can be used for
subsequent algorithms. Negative sampling, which samples negative triplets from
non-observed ones in the training data, is an important step in KG embedding.
Recently, generative adversarial network (GAN), has been introduced in negative
sampling. By sampling negative triplets with large scores, these methods avoid
the problem of vanishing gradient and thus obtain better performance. However,
using GAN makes the original model more complex and hard to train, where
reinforcement learning must be used. In this paper, motivated by the
observation that negative triplets with large scores are important but rare, we
propose to directly keep track of them with the cache. However, how to sample
from and update the cache are two important questions. We carefully design the
solutions, which are not only efficient but also achieve a good balance between
exploration and exploitation. In this way, our method acts as a ""distilled""
version of previous GA-based methods, which does not waste training time on
additional parameters to fit the full distribution of negative triplets. The
extensive experiments show that our method can gain significant improvement in
various KG embedding models, and outperform the state-of-the-art negative

at the same time, adaptively reduce the workload at existing machines when new
ones join the computation. Leveraging coded redundancy, our approach can
achieve similar computational cost as the original (noiseless) method when all
machines are present; the cost gracefully increases when machines are preempted
and reduces when machines join. The performance of the proposed technique is
evaluated on matrix-vector multiplication and linear regression tasks. In
experimental validations, it can achieve exactly the same numerical result as
the noiseless computation, while reducing the computation time by 46% when
compared to non-adaptive coding schemes.

Remarkably, the resonant signals are strongly enhanced in the bipolar regime.
This enhancement is caused in part by the Fabry-Perot resonances that appear in
the bipolar regime and possibly also by the photothermoelectric effect that can
be very pronounced in graphene p-n junctions under microwave irradiation.

change, leading to the well-known butterfly diagram. This phenomenon is poorly
understood for other stars as starspot latitudes are generally unknown. The
related changes in starspot rotation rates caused by latitudinal differential
rotation can however be measured. Using the set of 3093 Kepler stars with
activity cycles identified by Reinhold et al. (2017), we aim to study the
temporal change in starspot rotation rates over magnetic activity cycles, and
how this relates to the activity level, mean rotation rate, and effective
temperature of the star. We measure the photometric variability as a proxy for
the magnetic activity and the spot rotation rate in each quarter over the
duration of the Kepler mission. We phase-fold these measurements with the cycle
period. We perform averages over stars with comparable mean rotation rates and
effective temperature at fixed activity-cycle phases. We detect a clear
correlation between the variation of activity level and the variation of the
starspot rotation rate. The sign and amplitude of this correlation depends on
the mean stellar rotation and, to a lesser extent, on the effective
temperature. For slowly rotating stars (with periods between 15-28 days) the
starspot rotation rates are clearly anti-correlated with the level of activity
during the activity cycles. A transition is seen at periods of 10-15 days,
where stars with effective temperature above 4200K instead show positive
correlation. Our results can be interpreted in terms of a stellar ""butterfly
diagram"", but these appear different from the Sun's as the starspot rotation
rates are either in phase or anti-phase with the activity level. Alternatively,
the activity cycles seen by Kepler are short (around 2.5 years) and may
therefore be secondary cycles, perhaps analogous to the solar quasi-biennial
oscillations.

$X^m$ with values in $X$ (in such a case we say that a GIFS is \emph{of order}

known only few examples of~fractal sets which are generated by GIFSs, but which
are not IFSs' {attractors}.
  In the paper we study $0$-dimensional compact metrizable spaces from the
perspective of GIFSs' theory. We prove that each such space $X$ (in particular,
countable with limit {scattered} height) is homeomorphic to the~attractor of
some GIFS on the real line. Moreover, we prove that $X$ can be embedded into
the real line $\R$ as {the attractor of some} GIFS of order $m$ and (in the

embedded as {a nonattractor of any GIFS}. {Then} we show that a relatively
simple modifications of $X$ deliver spaces whose each connected component is
""big"" and which are GIFS's { attractors} not homeomorphic with IFS's

Richardson-Gaudin model integrable in an external magnetic field. This includes
the possibility for fully anisotropic XYZ coupling such that the $S^x_iS^x_j$,
$S^y_iS^y_j$ and $S^z_iS^z_j$ terms all have distinct coupling strengths. While
insuring that integrability is maintained in the presence of an external field
excludes the elliptic XYZ model which is only integrable at zero field, this
work still covers a wide class of fully anisotropic (XYZ) models associated
with non skew-symmetric r-matrices.
  The eigenstates, as constructed here, do not require any usable Bethe ansatz
and therefore: no proper pseudo-vacuum, Bethe roots, or generalised spin
raising (Gaudin) operators have to be defined. Indeed, the eigenstates are
generically built only through the conserved charges which define the model of
interest and the specification of the set of eigenvalues defining the
particular eigenstate. Since these eigenvalues are, in general, solutions to a
simple set of quadratic equations, the proposed approach is simpler to
implement than any Bethe ansatz and, moreover, it remains completely identical
independently of the symmetries of the model. Indeed, the construction removes
any distinction between XYZ models and XXZ/XXX models and, generically, that
between models with or without U(1) so that any difficulties associated with
the use of a Bethe ansatz in any of these cases are avoided.

electromagnetic energy stored in the magnetosphere will be released to the
acceleration of charged particles along the magnetic field lines. When the
pulsar is close enough to the gravitational wave source (e.g., $\sim10^{-2}$ pc
to the gravitational wave sources observed recently), the resulting energy loss
rate is comparable with the radio luminosity of the pulsar. It is also noticed
that, under very stringent conditions (for magnetars with much shorter distance
to the sources), the released energy can reach the typical energy observed from
fast radio bursts (FRBs).

independently via either the spin polarization or the charge densities. To
understand statistical properties and the phase diagram in the course of
cooling under the controlled parameters, we present here an analytical
treatment supported by Monte Carlo simulations for a generic coarse-grained
two-fields model of XY-Ising type. The degeneracies give rise to two coexisting
types of topologically nontrivial configurations: phase vortices and amplitude
kinks -- the solitons. In 2D, 3D states with long-range (or BKT type) orders,
the topological confinement sets in at a temperature $T=T_1$ which binds
together the kinks and unusual half-integer vortices. At a lower $T=T_2$, the
solitons start to aggregate into walls formed as rods of amplitude kinks which
are ultimately terminated by half-integer vortices. With lowering $T$, the
walls multiply passing sequentially across the sample.
  The presented results indicate a possible physical realization of a peculiar
system of half-integer vortices with rods of amplitude kinks connecting their
cores. Its experimental realization becomes feasible in view of recent

reveals a self-organization of the polarization states in this system leading
to a saturation of the Faraday rotation-induced reciprocity breaking, an
increase of the localization length, and a decrease of transmission

narrow armchair graphene nanoribbon (AGNR) in the presence of a longitudinal
external electric field directed parallel to the ribbon axis. The two-body 2D
Dirac equation for the massless electron and hole subject to the ribbon
confinement, Coulomb interaction and electric field is employed. The ribbon
confinement is assumed to be much stronger than the internal exciton electric
field which in turn considerably exceeds the external electric field. This
justifies an adiabatic approximation implying a slow longitudinal and fast
transverse electron-hole relative motion governed by the exciton attraction and
accompanied by the external electric field and ribbon confinement effects,
respectively. In the single subband approximation of the isolated
size-quantized subbands induced by the ribbon confinement the exciton
electroabsorption coefficient is determined in an explicit form. The pronounced
dependencies of the exciton peak positions, widths and intensities on the
ribbon width and electric field strength are traced. The electron-hole exciton
attraction modifies remarkably the Franz-Keldysh electroabsorption in the
frequency region both below and above the edges determined by the
size-quantized energy levels. In the double-subband approximation of the
interacting ground and first excited subbands the combined effect of the
exciton electro- and autoionization caused by the electric field and
intersubband coupling, respectively, are explored. Estimates of the expected
experimental values for the typically employed AGNR show that for a weak
electric field the exciton quasi-discrete states remain sufficiently stable to
be observed in optical experiments, while relatively strong fields free the
captured carriers to further restore their contribution to the transport.

between the electroweak scale and one or more SUSY masses a numerical
determination with $\overline{\text{DR}}$ Higgs field renormalization induces
higher order terms which would cancel in a more complete calculation. The
origin of these terms is the momentum dependence of contributions involving at
least one of the heavy particles. We present two different methods to avoid
their appearance. In the first approach, the poles are determined by expanding
around the one-loop solutions. In the second approach, a ""heavy-OS"" Higgs field
renormalization is employed in order to absorb the momentum dependence of heavy
contributions. We will find that the first approach leads to an unwanted
behaviour of the Higgs boson mass predictions close to crossing points where
two Higgs bosons that mix with each other are almost mass degenerate. These
problems are avoided in the second approach, which became the default approach
used in the public code FeynHiggs. Despite the discussion being very specific
to the MSSM, the argumentation and the methods presented in this work are
straightforwardly applicable to the determination of propagator poles in other

differential graded Lie algebras. Their minimal model brackets are then given
by a sum of trivalent (cubic) Feynman tree graphs. The amplitudes are gauge
independent when all internal lines are off-shell, not merely up to $L_\infty$
isomorphism, and we include a homological algebra proof of this fact. Using the
homological perturbation lemma, we construct homotopies (propagators) that are
optimal in bringing out the factorization of the residues of the amplitudes.
Using a variant of Hartogs extension for singular varieties, we give a rigorous
account of a recursive characterization of the amplitudes via their residues
independent of their original definition in terms of Feynman graphs (this does
neither involve so-called BCFW shifts nor conditions at infinity under such
shifts). Roughly, the amplitude with $N$ legs is the unique section of a sheaf
on a variety of $N$ complex momenta whose residues along a finite list of
irreducible codimension one subvarieties (prime divisors) factor into
amplitudes with less than $N$ legs. The sheaf is a direct sum of rank one
sheaves labeled by helicity signs. To emphasize that amplitudes are robust

relations in a knowledge graph. They are remarkably powerful in the link
prediction and knowledge base completion tasks, mainly due to the learned
representations that capture important statistical dependencies in the data.
Recent works in the area have focused on either designing new scoring functions
or incorporating extra information into the learning process to improve the
representations. Yet the representations are mostly learned from the observed
links between entities, ignoring commonsense or schema knowledge associated
with the relations in the graph. A fundamental aspect of the topology of
relational data is the cardinality information, which bounds the number of
predictions given for a relation between a minimum and maximum frequency. In
this paper, we propose a new regularisation approach to incorporate relation
cardinality constraints to any existing neural link predictor without affecting
their efficiency or scalability. Our regularisation term aims to impose
boundaries on the number of predictions with high probability, thus,
structuring the embeddings space to respect commonsense cardinality assumptions
resulting in better representations. Experimental results on Freebase, WordNet

positively impacts the predictive accuracy of downstream link prediction tasks.

composed of Graphene (G)/Platinum Oxide (PtO)/n-Silicon (Si) heterostructure.
The sensor was tested with different glucose concentrations and interfering
solutions to investigate its sensitivity and selectivity. Different structures
of the device were studied by adjusting the platinum oxide film thickness to
investigate its catalytic activity. It was found that the film thickness plays
a significant role in the efficiency of glucose oxidation and hence in overall
device sensitivity. 0.8-2 uA output current was obtained in the case of 4-10 mM
with a sensitivity of 0.2 uA/mM.cm2. Besides, results have shown that 0.8 uA
and 15 uA were obtained by testing 4 mM glucose on two different PtO
thicknesses, 30 nm, and 50 nm, respectively. The sensitivity of the device was
enhanced by 150% (i.e., up to 30 uA/mM.cm2) by increasing the PtO layer
thickness. This was attributed to both the increase of the number of active
sites for glucose oxidation as well as the increase in the graphene layer
thickness, which leads to enhanced charge carriers concentration and mobility.
Moreover, theoretical investigations were conducted using the Density Function
Theory (DFT) to understand the detection method and the origins of selectivity
better. The working principle of the sensors puts it in a competitive position
with other non-enzymatic glucose sensors. DFT calculations provided a
qualitative explanation of the charge distribution across the graphene sheet
within a system of a platinum substrate with D-glucose molecules above. The
proposed G/PtO/n-Si heterostructure has proven to satisfy these factors, which
opens the door for further developments of more reliable non-enzymatic
glucometers for continuous glucose monitoring systems.

and the extensive existence of renewal service processes in communication
networks, this paper thoroughly investigates the effective capacity for renewal
processes. Based on Z-transform, we derive exact analytical expressions for the
effective capacity at a given quality of service (QoS) exponent for both the
renewal processes with constant reward and with variable rewards. Unlike prior
literature that the effective capacity is approximated with no many insightful
discussions, our expression is simple and reveals further meaningful results,
such as the monotonicity and bounds of effective capacity. The analytical
results are then applied to evaluate the cross-layer throughput for diverse
hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) systems, including fixed-rate HARQ
(FR-HARQ, e.g., Type I HARQ, HARQ with chase combining (HARQ-CC) and HARQ with
incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR)), variable-rate HARQ (VR-HARQ) and
cross-packet HARQ (XP-HARQ). Numerical results corroborate the analytical ones
and prove the superiority of our proposed approach. Furthermore, targeting at
maximizing the effective capacity via the optimal rate selection, it is
revealed that VR-HARQ and XP-HARQ attain almost the same performance, and both
of them perform better than FR-HARQ.

structure. The geometric randomization (GR) model assumes a homogeneous
distribution of the nodes in an underlying similarity space and uses rewirings
of the links to find configurations that maximize a connection probability akin
to that of the $\mathbb{S}^1$ or $\mathbb{H}^2$ geometric network models.
However, GR preserves the original degree sequence, as in the configuration
model, thus eliminating the fluctuations of the degree cutoff. Moreover, the
model does not require the explicit estimation of hidden degree variables,
which restricts the number of free parameters to one, controlling the level of
clustering in the rewired network. We illustrate the potential of GR as a null
model by investigating the effects on modularity that derive from the
flattening of geometric communities in both real and synthetic networks. As a
result, we find that for real networks the geometric and topological
communities are consistent, while for the randomized counterparts, the
topological communities detected are attributable to structural constraints
induced by the underlying geometric architecture.

These phases are separated by continuous transitions; the phase diagram is

show that symmetric disorder destroys the sublattice ordering and therefore the
active asymmetric phase is not present. On the other hand, for asymmetric
disorder (each sublattice presenting a distinct dilution rate) the phase
transition occurs between the absorbing and the active asymmetric phases. The
universality class of this transition is governed by the less disordered

  Neuroimaging",,,,,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Neuroimaging datasets are rapidly growing in size as a result of advancements
in image acquisition methods, open-science and data sharing. However, the
adoption of Big Data processing strategies by neuroimaging processing engines
remains limited. Here, we evaluate three Big Data processing strategies
(in-memory computing, data locality and lazy evaluation) on typical
neuroimaging use cases, represented by the BigBrain dataset. We contrast these
various strategies using Apache Spark and Nipype as our representative Big Data
and neuroimaging processing engines, on Dell EMC's Top-500 cluster. Big Data
thresholds were modelled by comparing the data-write rate of the application to
the filesystem bandwidth and number of concurrent processes. This model
acknowledges the fact that page caching provided by the Linux kernel is
critical to the performance of Big Data applications. Results show that
in-memory computing alone speeds-up executions by a factor of up to 1.6,
whereas when combined with data locality, this factor reaches 5.3. Lazy
evaluation strategies were found to increase the likelihood of cache hits,
further improving processing time. Such important speed-up values are likely to
be observed on typical image processing operations performed on images of size
larger than 75GB. A ballpark speculation from our model showed that in-memory
computing alone will not speed-up current functional MRI analyses unless
coupled with data locality and processing around 280 subjects concurrently.
Furthermore, we observe that emulating in-memory computing using in-memory file
systems (tmpfs) does not reach the performance of an in-memory engine,
presumably due to swapping to disk and the lack of data cleanup. We conclude
that Big Data processing strategies are worth developing for neuroimaging
applications.

considers two gaps with point nodes of different magnitude on different gap

these two models and then, a detailed numerical study of the electronic

that the observed specific heat jump at T$_c$ is precisely reproduced. Also, it

inelastic energy transfer. However, the aberration-free images can be still
recorded in a plane that is tilted with respect to the optical axis. This
distortion can be thus fully compensated by inclining appropriately the x-ray
imaging detector, which simultaneously improves its spatial resolution. A full
simulation of imaging IXS spectra from a realistic sample demonstrates the
excellent performance of the proposed designs.

efficiently solved via the successive lower-bound maximization approach with a

one of the primary sources of information that can be used for the efficient
allocation of wireless resources. Obtaining downlink (DL) CSI in Frequency
Division Duplexing (FDD) systems from uplink (UL) CSI is not as straightforward
as in TDD systems. Therefore, users usually feed the DL-CSI back to the
transmitter. To remove the need for feedback (and thus having less signaling
overhead), we propose to use two recent deep neural network structures, i.e.,
convolutional neural networks and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to
infer the DL-CSI by observing the UL-CSI. The core idea of our data-driven
scheme is exploiting the fact that both DL and UL channels share the same
propagation environment. As such, we extracted the environment information from
the UL channel response to a latent domain and then transferred the derived
environment information from the latent domain to predict the DL channel. To
overcome incorrect latent domain and the problem of oversimplistic assumptions,
in this work, we did not use any specific parametric model and instead used
data-driven approaches to discover the underlying structure of data without any
prior model assumptions. To overcome the challenge of capturing the UL-DL joint
distribution, we used a mean square error-based variant of the GAN structure
with improved convergence properties called boundary equilibrium GAN (BEGAN).
For training and testing we used simulated data of Extended Vehicular-A (EVA)
and Extended Typical Urban (ETU) models. Simulation results verified that our
methods can accurately infer and predict the downlink CSI from the uplink CSI

biophysics. We provide comprehensive tables of global energy minima for
$N\leq120$ and local energy minima for $N\leq65$, and we exclude all saddle

households of all social classes within a community. To address food security
issues following a natural disaster, the recovery of several elements of the
built environment within a community, including its building portfolio, must be
considered. Building portfolio restoration is one of the most challenging
elements of recovery owing to the complexity and dimensionality of the problem.
This study introduces a stochastic scheduling algorithm for the identification
of optimal building portfolio recovery strategies. The proposed approach
provides a computationally tractable formulation to manage multi-state,
large-scale infrastructure systems. A testbed community modeled after Gilroy,
California, is used to illustrate how the proposed approach can be implemented
efficiently and accurately to find the near-optimal decisions related to
building recovery following a severe earthquake.

Neural Networks (CNNs) that are designed and trained to identify numerous
object classes. Such networks are fairly resource intensive to compute,
prohibiting their deployment on resource-constrained embedded platforms. On one
hand, the ability to classify an exhaustive list of categories is excessive for
the demands of most IoT applications. On the other hand, designing a new
custom-designed CNN for each new IoT application is impractical, due to the
inherent difficulty in developing competitive models and time-to-market
pressure. To address this problem, we investigate the question of: ""Can one
utilize an existing optimized CNN model to automatically build a competitive
CNN for an IoT application whose objects of interest are a fraction of
categories that the original CNN was designed to classify, such that the
resource requirement is proportionally scaled down?"" We use the term resource
scalability to refer to this concept, and develop a methodology for automated
synthesis of resource scalable CNNs from an existing optimized baseline CNN.
The synthesized CNN has sufficient learning capacity for handling the given IoT
application requirements, and yields competitive accuracy. The proposed
approach is fast, and unlike the presently common practice of CNN design, does
not require iterative rounds of training trial and error.

forecasting when a pattern might occur before such an occurrence is actually
detected by a CEP engine. We present Wayeb, a tool that attempts to address the
issue of Complex Event Forecasting. Wayeb employs symbolic automata as a
computational model for pattern detection and Markov chains for deriving a
