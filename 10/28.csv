introduction of large-scale renewable energy generation in the Colombian
electricity market. The new legislation aims to diversify the country's
generation matrix, mainly composed of hydro and fuel-based generation, with a
share of 66% and 34% respectively. Currently, three wind generation projects,
with an aggregated capacity of 500 MW, have been commissioned in the North of
the country. This study analyses the economic impact of the large-scale
introduction of wind generation on both, the market spot price and conventional
generation plants operation. For this purpose, the study builds a unit
commitment model to mimic the current market legislation and the system's
generation data. We show that the introduction of wind energy into the
Colombian electricity market would impact the generation share of large hydro
and gas-fired power plants. The hydro generation has an important role in
balancing the generation for fluctuations on the wind resource. Meanwhile, the
gas-fired plants would decrease their participation in the market,
proportionally to the introduction of wind generation in the system, by as low
as 20% of its current operation.

with a small subset of relevant labels chosen from an extremely large pool of

labels as a tree, like in the hierarchical softmax (HSM) approach commonly used
for multi-class problems. In this paper, we investigate probabilistic label
trees (PLTs) that have been recently devised for tackling XMLC problems. We
show that PLTs are a no-regret multi-label generalization of HSM when
precision@k is used as a model evaluation metric. Critically, we prove that
pick-one-label heuristic - a reduction technique from multi-label to
multi-class that is routinely used along with HSM - is not consistent in
general. We also show that our implementation of PLTs, referred to as
extremeText (XT), obtains significantly better results than HSM with the
pick-one-label heuristic and XML-CNN, a deep network specifically designed for
XMLC problems. Moreover, XT is competitive to many state-of-the-art approaches
in terms of statistical performance, model size and prediction time which makes
it amenable to deploy in an online system.

of an evolutionary algorithm converges to zero per generation. It is defined as
the geometric average of the reduction rate of the approximation error over
consecutive generations. This paper makes a theoretical analysis of the ACR in
continuous optimization. The obtained results are summarized as follows.
According to the limit property, the ACR is classified into two categories: (1)
linear ACR whose limit inferior value is larger than a positive and (2)
sublinear ACR whose value converges to zero. Then, it is proven that the ACR is
linear for evolutionary programming using positive landscape-adaptive mutation,
but sublinear for that using landscape-invariant or zero landscape-adaptive

also classified into two categories: (1) polynomial ACR whose value is larger
than the reciprocal of a polynomial function of the dimension for any
generation, and (2) exponential ACR whose value is less than the reciprocal of
an exponential function of the dimension for an exponential long period. It is
proven that for easy problems such as linear functions, the ACR of the (1+1)
adaptive random univariate search is polynomial. But for hard functions such as
the deceptive function, the ACR of both the (1+1) adaptive random univariate

faced with the problem of finding assertions to fit existing code. In 1971 this
mode of verification was declared by Dijkstra as too hard to be of practical

this was independently published by Reynolds in 1978 and by van Emden in 1979.
The latter was further developed to attain the form of matrix code. This form
of code not only obviates the need of fitting assertions to existing code, but
helps in discovering an algorithm that reaches a given postcondition from a
fixed precondition. In this paper a keyboard-editable version of matrix code is
presented that uses E.W. Dijkstra's guarded commands as starting point. The

monitoring the AB X-ray luminosities, the HRC-I sequence represents a unique
decadal record of the dozen, or so, serendipitous X-ray sources in the Alpha
Cen field, which is at low Galactic latitude and thus dominated by nearby
stars. For the present study, the ten brightest candidates were considered.
Only a handful of these were persistent; most were variable, some highly so,
flaring in a few epochs, weak or absent in the others. All ten X-ray sources
have Gaia objects within about 2 arcseconds; mostly late-type dwarfs, but a few
giants. However, two of the proposed optical counterparts have statistically
significant offsets, and possible conflicts between the X-ray and optical
properties. Another of the candidates brightened a factor of 100 in X-rays
during a single exposure, briefly attaining super-flare status. The Gaia

semi-numerical reionization model to solve for the topology of reionization and
an approximate model of how reionization heats the IGM, with the massively
parallel \texttt{Nyx} hydrodynamics code, specifically designed to solve for

models, we find up to $\sim 50\%$ differences in the large scale properties

to the thermal fluctuations. We show that these differences could allow one to
distinguish between different reionization scenarios already with existing
Ly$\alpha$ forest measurements. Finally, we explore the differences in the
small-scale cutoff of the power spectrum and we find that, for the same heat

topic in celestial mechanics and astrodynamics, e.g. to study the stability of

(HOTM) method enables efficient mapping of perturbed Keplerian orbits over many
revolutions. For this, the method uses the high-order Taylor expansion of a
Poincar\'e or stroboscopic map, which is accurate close to the expansion point.
In this paper, we investigate the performance of the HOTM method using
different element sets for building the high-order map. The element sets
investigated are the classical orbital elements, modified equinoctial elements,
Hill variables, cylindrical coordinates and Deprit's ideal elements. The
performances of the different coordinate sets are tested by comparing the
accuracy and efficiency of mapping low-Earth and highly-elliptical orbits
perturbed by $J_2$ with numerical propagation. The accuracy of HOTM depends
strongly on the choice of elements and type of orbit. A new set of elements is
introduced that enables extremely accurate mapping of the state, even for high
eccentricities and higher-order zonal perturbations. Finally, the high-order
map is shown to be very useful for the determination and study of fixed points

beams with small radius collapse into their axis due to the pull by the
secondary wakefields generated by some of the beam electrons reaching the axis.
Hollow beams with sufficiently large radius, however, can propagate stably in
plasmas for several meters and be used for positron acceleration.

recognition and reconstruction problems in robotics and computer vision.
Inference in MRFs is intractable in general and related work resorts to
approximation algorithms. Among those techniques, semidefinite programming
(SDP) relaxations have been shown to provide accurate estimates while scaling
poorly with the problem size and being typically slow for practical
applications. Our first contribution is to design a dual ascent method to solve
standard SDP relaxations that takes advantage of the geometric structure of the
problem to speed up computation. This technique, named Dual Ascent Riemannian
Staircase (DARS), is able to solve large problem instances in seconds. Our
second contribution is to develop a second and faster approach. The backbone of
this second approach is a novel SDP relaxation combined with a fast and
scalable solver based on smooth Riemannian optimization. We show that this
approach, named Fast Unconstrained SEmidefinite Solver (FUSES), can solve large
problems in milliseconds. Contrarily to local MRF solvers, e.g., loopy belief
propagation, our approaches do not require an initial guess. Moreover, we
leverage recent results from optimization theory to provide per-instance
sub-optimality guarantees. We demonstrate the proposed approaches in
multi-class image segmentation problems. Extensive experimental evidence shows
that (i) FUSES and DARS produce near-optimal solutions, attaining an objective
within 0.1% of the optimum, (ii) FUSES and DARS are remarkably faster than
general-purpose SDP solvers, and FUSES is more than two orders of magnitude
faster than DARS while attaining similar solution quality, (iii) FUSES is

the ocean's density stratification profile simply from free surface elevation
data. Satellite observations suggest that ocean surface contains the signature
of internal tides, which are internal gravity waves generated by the barotropic
tides. Since internal tides contain the information of ocean's density
stratification, the latter can in principle be reconstructed from the free
surface signature. We consider a simple theoretical model that approximates a
continuously stratified ocean as discrete layers of constant buoyancy
frequency; this facilitates the derivation of a closed-form dispersion
relation. First, we numerically simulate internal tide generation for toy ocean
scenarios and subsequently perform Space-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) of the
free surface, which yields internal tide spectra with wavenumbers corresponding
to the tidal frequency. The density profile is reconstructed by substituting
these wavenumbers into the dispersion relation. Finally, we consider a more
realistic situation with rotation, bottom topography, shear and density
profiles representative of the Strait of Gibraltar. Density reconstruction in
the presence and absence of shear are respectively found to be $90.2\%$ and
$94.2\%$ accurate.

Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems operating in the wild. Perceptual
aliasing is the phenomenon where different places generate a similar visual
(or, in general, perceptual) footprint. This causes spurious measurements to be
fed to the SLAM estimator, which typically results in incorrect localization
and mapping results. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that those outliers
are highly correlated, in the sense that perceptual aliasing creates a large
number of mutually-consistent outliers. Another issue stems from the fact that
most state-of-the-art techniques rely on a given trajectory guess (e.g., from
odometry) to discern between inliers and outliers and this makes the resulting
pipeline brittle, since the accumulation of error may result in incorrect
choices and recovery from failures is far from trivial. This work provides a
unified framework to model perceptual aliasing in SLAM and provides practical
algorithms that can cope with outliers without relying on any initial guess. We
present two main contributions. The first is a Discrete-Continuous Graphical
Model (DC-GM) for SLAM: the continuous portion of the DC-GM captures the
standard SLAM problem, while the discrete portion describes the selection of
the outliers and models their correlation. The second contribution is a
semidefinite relaxation to perform inference in the DC-GM that returns
estimates with provable sub-optimality guarantees. Experimental results on
standard benchmarking datasets show that the proposed technique compares
favorably with state-of-the-art methods while not relying on an initial guess

the IoT connectivity, due to its ubiquitous and low-cost property. This paper
investigates the spatial-frequency property of the OFDM backscatter which takes
the distance and the angle into account in different frequency bands. We deploy
three typical scenarios for performing measurements to evaluate the received
signal strength from the backscatter link. The impact of the distances among
the transmitter, the tag and the receiver, as well as the angle between the
transmitter and the tag is observed through the obtained measurement data. From
the evaluation results, it is found that the best location of tag is either
close to the receiver or the transmitter which depends on the frequency band,
and the best angle is 90 degrees between the transmitter and the receiver. This
work opens the shed light on the spatial deployment of the backscatter tag in
different frequency band with the aim of improving the performance and reducing

proposed to detect and/or recognize macro/micro human movements. These systems
often suffer from various interferences caused by multiple-users moving
simultaneously, resulting in extremely low recognition accuracy. To tackle this
challenge, we propose a novel system, called Motion-Fi, which marries battery
free wireless backscattering and device-free sensing. Motion-Fi is an accurate,
interference tolerable motion-recognition system, which counts repetitive
motions without using scenario-dependent templates or profiles and enables
multi-users performing certain motions simultaneously because of the relatively
short transmission range of backscattered signals. Although the repetitive
motions are fairly well detectable through the backscattering signals in
theory, in reality they get blended into various other system noises during the
motion. Moreover, irregular motion patterns among users will lead to expensive
computation cost for motion recognition. We build a backscattering wireless
platform to validate our design in various scenarios for over 6 months when
different persons, distances and orientations are incorporated. In our
experiments, the periodicity in motions could be recognized without any
learning or training process, and the accuracy of counting such motions can be
achieved within 5% count error. With little efforts in learning the patterns,
our method could achieve 93.1% motion-recognition accuracy for a variety of
motions. Moreover, by leveraging the periodicity of motions, the recognition
accuracy could be further improved to nearly 100% with only 3 repetitions. Our
experiments also show that the motions of multiple persons separating by around

examples that make neural network models robust against perturbations. Despite
its empirical success, its theoretical property is not well understood. This
paper develops theory to explain the regularization effect of Generalized FGSM,
a class of methods to generate adversarial examples. Motivated from the
relationship between FGSM and LASSO penalty, the asymptotic properties of
Generalized FGSM are derived in the Generalized Linear Model setting, which is
essentially the 1-layer neural network setting with certain activation
functions. In such simple neural network models, I prove that Generalized FGSM
estimation is root n-consistent and weakly oracle under proper conditions. The
asymptotic results are also highly similar to penalized likelihood estimation.
Nevertheless, Generalized FGSM introduces additional bias when data sampling is
not sign neutral, a concept I introduce to describe the balance-ness of the
noise signs. Although the theory in this paper is developed under simple neural
network settings, I argue that it may give insights and justification for FGSM
in deep neural network settings as well.

each body and covering a finite domain of space around the body. Gravitational
field of each body is parametrized by an infinite set of the body's mass and
spin multipoles and tidal multipoles of external N-1 bodies. The origin of the
local coordinates is set moving along accelerated worldline of the center of
mass of the body by an appropriate choice of the internal and external dipole

the method of asymptotic matching. The matching is also used for separating the
post-Newtonian self-field effects from the external gravitational environment

to present the equations of translational and rotational motion of each body in
covariant form by making use of the Einstein principle of equivalence. Our
approach significantly generalizes the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon covariant

rotational motion derived in the present paper include the infinite set of mass

Yet, the nature of the AGN in NGC 1275 is still controversial. It has been
debated whether this is a broad emission line (BEL) Seyfert galaxy, an obscured
Seyfert galaxy, a narrow line radio galaxy or a BL-Lac object. We clearly
demonstrate a persistent H$\beta$ BEL over the last 35 years with a full width
half maximum (FWHM) of 4150 - 6000 km/s. We also find a prominent P$\alpha$ BEL
(FWHM $\approx 4770 $ km/s) and a weak CIV BEL (FWHM $\approx 4000 $ km/s),
H$\beta$/CIV $\approx 2$. A far UV HST observation during suppressed jet
activity reveals a low luminosity continuum. The H$\beta$ BEL luminosity is
typical of broad line Seyfert galaxies with similar far UV luminosity. X-ray
observations indicate a softer ionizing continuum than expected for a broad
line Seyfert galaxy with similar far UV luminosity. This is opposite of the
expectation of advection dominated accretion. The AGN continuum appears to be
thermal emission from a low luminosity, optically thick, accretion flow with a
low Eddington ratio, $\sim 0.0001$. The soft, weak ionizing continuum is
consistent with the relatively weak CIV BEL. Evidence that the BEL luminosity
is correlated with the jet mm wave luminosity is presented. Apparently, the
accretion rate regulates jet power.

The literature has always aimed, though, at assigning the adopted network (or
networks, in case of multiple streams) the task of recognizing the whole number
of action classes in the dataset at hand. We propose to train multiple
specialized module networks instead. Each module is trained to recognize a
subset of the action classes. Towards this goal, we present a
dissimilarity-based optimized procedure for distributing the action classes

performance, that is superior in some aspects, to the state-of-the-art, and
that satisfies the real-time constraint. We achieved 72.5\% accuracy on the

reaction, is often observed as sudden flare-induced changes in vector magnetic
field and sunspot motions. However, it remains obscure whether evolving flare
ribbons, the flare signature closest to the photosphere, are accompanied by
changes in vector magnetic field therein. Here we explore the relationship
between the dynamics of flare ribbons in the chromosphere and variations of
magnetic fields in the underlying photosphere, using high-resolution off-band
H-alpha images and near-infrared vector magnetograms of the M6.5 flare on 2015
June 22 observed with the 1.6 m Goode Solar Telescope. We find that changes of
photospheric fields occur at the arrival of the flare ribbon front, thus
propagating analogously to flare ribbons. In general, the horizontal field
increases and the field lines become more inclined to the surface. When ribbons
sweep through regions that undergo a rotational motion, the fields transiently
turn more vertical with decreased horizontal field and inclination angle, and
then restore and/or become more horizontal than before the ribbon arrival. The
ribbon propagation decelerates near the sunspot rotation center, where the
vertical field becomes permanently enhanced. Similar magnetic field changes are
discernible in magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI),
and an inward collapse of coronal magnetic fields is inferred from the time
sequence of non-linear force-free field models extrapolated from HMI
magnetograms. We conclude that photospheric fields respond nearly
instantaneously to magnetic reconnection in the corona.

mimicking the true model and a discriminator distinguishing the samples
produced by the generator from the real training samples. Given an
unconstrained discriminator able to approximate any function, this game reduces
to finding the generative model minimizing a divergence measure, e.g. the
Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence, to the data distribution. However, in practice
the discriminator is constrained to be in a smaller class $\mathcal{F}$ such as
neural nets. Then, a natural question is how the divergence minimization
interpretation changes as we constrain $\mathcal{F}$. In this work, we address
this question by developing a convex duality framework for analyzing GANs. For
a convex set $\mathcal{F}$, this duality framework interprets the original GAN
formulation as finding the generative model with minimum JS-divergence to the
distributions penalized to match the moments of the data distribution, with the
moments specified by the discriminators in $\mathcal{F}$. We show that this
interpretation more generally holds for f-GAN and Wasserstein GAN. As a
byproduct, we apply the duality framework to a hybrid of f-divergence and
Wasserstein distance. Unlike the f-divergence, we prove that the proposed
hybrid divergence changes continuously with the generative model, which
suggests regularizing the discriminator's Lipschitz constant in f-GAN and
vanilla GAN. We numerically evaluate the power of the suggested regularization
schemes for improving GAN's training performance.

similarly when no gate voltage is applied. For a finite gate voltage, both
develop a conductance gap characteristic of a biased bilayer, but only one
shows a pronounced conductance step at the gap edge. A gate voltage domain wall
applied to the bilayer region renders the conductance of the two configurations
similar. For a microstructure consisting of equally spaced domain walls, we
find a high sensitivity to the domain size. This is attributed to the presence
of topologically protected in-gap states localized at domain walls, which
hybridize as the domain size becomes of the order of their confining scale. Our
results show that transmission through a bilayer region can be manipulated by a
gate voltage in ways not previously anticipated.

either a member of a central path, or joined to that central path by a single
edge. In other words, caterpillar trees are the class of trees which become
path graphs after removing all leaves. In 1973, F. Harary and A.J. Schwenk
provided two proofs found in [1] which show that the number of non-isomorphic
caterpillars with N vertices is given by the formula $2^{N-4} + \ 2^{ \lfloor
\frac{N - 4}{2}\rfloor}$, where $\lfloor \ \rfloor$ denotes the floor function.
The first proof follows from a special case of an application of P\'{o}lya's
Enumeration theorem on graphs with integer-weighted vertices. The second proof
proceeds through an appropriate edge labelling of the caterpillars. The proof
presented here owes much of its insight to the first two, but has the benefit
of utilizing a natural labelling for the caterpillars. We will proceed by
labelling the vertices of the caterpillars with integer-weights, followed by an
application of the orbit-counting theorem.

mechanism is introduced to modify the classical threshold time series model by
capturing the stickiness of signal. Besides, considering the inadequacy of
traditional models under the lack of information, a signal retrospection is run
in this model to provide a more accurate judgment. Moreover, formal proofs
suggest strict stationarity and geometric ergodicity of BDAR model under
several sufficient conditions. A Gaussian quasi-maximum likelihood estimation
(QMLE) is employed and the asymptotic distributions of its estimators are
derived. It has been demonstrated that the estimated thresholds of the BDAR
model are $n$-consistent, each of which converges weakly to a functional of a
two-sided compound Poisson process. The remaining parameters are
$\sqrt{n}$-consistent and asymptotically normal. Furthermore, a model selection
criteria and its asymptotic property have been established. Simulation studies

is a fundamental tenet of statistical learning. Over the past decade, it

consider two problems related to the min-max risk (expected loss) of estimating
an unknown $k$-state Markov chain from its $n$ sequential samples: predicting
the conditional distribution of the next sample with respect to the
KL-divergence, and estimating the transition matrix with respect to a natural

  For the first measure, we determine the min-max prediction risk to within a
linear factor in the alphabet size, showing it is $\Omega(k\log\log n\ / n)$

technology to share radio spectrum among different networks. As a secondary
user (SU), a DSA device will face two critical problems: avoiding causing
harmful interference to primary users (PUs), and conducting effective
interference coordination with other secondary users. These two problems become
even more challenging for a distributed DSA network where there is no
centralized controllers for SUs. In this paper, we investigate communication
strategies of a distributive DSA network under the presence of spectrum sensing
errors. To be specific, we apply the powerful machine learning tool, deep
reinforcement learning (DRL), for SUs to learn ""appropriate"" spectrum access
strategies in a distributed fashion assuming NO knowledge of the underlying
system statistics. Furthermore, a special type of recurrent neural network
(RNN), called the reservoir computing (RC), is utilized to realize DRL by
taking advantage of the underlying temporal correlation of the DSA network.
Using the introduced machine learning-based strategy, SUs could make spectrum
access decisions distributedly relying only on their own current and past
spectrum sensing outcomes. Through extensive experiments, our results suggest
that the RC-based spectrum access strategy can help the SU to significantly
reduce the chances of collision with PUs and other SUs. We also show that our
scheme outperforms the myopic method which assumes the knowledge of system

  GPUs with Efficient Memory Access","To appear in ECOOP 2019",,"10.4230/LIPIcs.ECOOP.2019.16",,"cs.PL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Object-oriented programming has long been regarded as too inefficient for
SIMD high-performance computing, despite the fact that many important HPC
applications have an inherent object structure. On SIMD accelerators, including
GPUs, this is mainly due to performance problems with memory allocation and
memory access: There are a few libraries that support parallel memory
allocation directly on accelerator devices, but all of them suffer from
uncoalesed memory accesses.
  We discovered a broad class of object-oriented programs with many important
real-world applications that can be implemented efficiently on massively
parallel SIMD accelerators. We call this class Single-Method Multiple-Objects
(SMMO), because parallelism is expressed by running a method on all objects of
a type.
  To make fast GPU programming available to average programmers, we developed
DynaSOAr, a CUDA framework for SMMO applications. DynaSOAr consists of (1) a
fully-parallel, lock-free, dynamic memory allocator, (2) a data layout DSL and
(3) an efficient, parallel do-all operation. DynaSOAr achieves performance
superior to state-of-the-art GPU memory allocators by controlling both memory
allocation and memory access.
  DynaSOAr improves the usage of allocated memory with a Structure of Arrays
data layout and achieves low memory fragmentation through efficient management
of free and allocated memory blocks with lock-free, hierarchical bitmaps.
Contrary to other allocators, our design is heavily based on atomic operations,
trading raw (de)allocation performance for better overall application
performance. In our benchmarks, DynaSOAr achieves a speedup of application code
of up to 3x over state-of-the-art allocators. Moreover, DynaSOAr manages heap
memory more efficiently than other allocators, allowing programmers to run up
to 2x larger problem sizes with the same amount of memory.

physical properties consistent with absorption line systems with neutral

this paper we propose a novel parity-odd gravitational effect of neutrinos: A
unique contribution to the directions of the angular momentum field of galaxies

contributing to the results most. However, this framework fails to locate the
entire action instances and gives little consideration to the local context. In
this paper, we present a novel architecture called Cascaded Pyramid Mining
Network (CPMN) to address these issues using two effective modules. First, to
discover the entire temporal interval of specific action, we design a two-stage
cascaded module with proposed Online Adversarial Erasing (OAE) mechanism, where
new and complementary regions are mined through feeding the erased feature maps
of discovered regions back to the system. Second, to exploit hierarchical
contextual information in videos and reduce missing detections, we design a
pyramid module which produces a scale-invariant attention map through combining
the feature maps from different levels. Final, we aggregate the results of two
modules to perform action localization via locating high score areas in
temporal Class Activation Sequence (CAS). Extensive experiments conducted on
THUMOS14 and ActivityNet-1.3 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method.

strategy that minimizes the Bayesian risk taking into account of the sample

its acquisition process remain largely unknown. The circumstance that `no'
cannot be construed as a label for perceptible objects or events puts it
outside of the scope of most modern accounts of language acquisition. Moreover,
most symbol grounding architectures will struggle to ground the word due to its
non-referential character. In an experimental study involving the child-like
humanoid robot iCub that was designed to illuminate the acquisition process of
negation words, the robot is deployed in several rounds of speech-wise
unconstrained interaction with na\""ive participants acting as its language
teachers. The results corroborate the hypothesis that affect or volition plays
a pivotal role in the socially distributed acquisition process. Negation words
are prosodically salient within prohibitive utterances and negative intent
interpretations such that they can be easily isolated from the teacher's speech
signal. These words subsequently may be grounded in negative affective states.
However, observations of the nature of prohibitive acts and the temporal
relationships between its linguistic and extra-linguistic components raise
serious questions over the suitability of Hebbian-type algorithms for language
grounding.

These last decades, very practical reasons also led to studies of pattern
formation in relativistic electron bunches used in synchrotron radiation light
sources. As the main motivation, the patterns which spontaneously appear during
an instability increase the terahertz radiation power by factors exceeding
10000. However the irregularity of these patterns largely prevented
applications of this powerful source. Here we show how to make the
spatio-temporal patterns regular (and thus the emitted THz power) using a point
of view borrowed from chaos control theory. Mathematically, regular unstable
solutions are expected to coexist with the undesired irregular solutions, and
may thus be controllable using feedback control. We demonstrate the
stabilization of such regular solutions in the Synchrotron SOLEIL storage ring.
Operation of these ""controlled unstable solutions"" enables new designs of high

the discriminative power of intermediate layers and then select the most

short lead-time forecasts (nowcasts) necessary to anticipate flooding and
properly manage sewage systems in urban areas by combining radars, rain gauges,

uncertainties. A variational approach (3D-Var) is used to find the best
estimate for the rain rate, and its error covariance, from the different rain
sensors. Short-term rain rate forecasts are then produced by assuming
Lagrangian persistence. A velocity field is obtained from the operational
radar-derived rain fields, and the rain rate field is advected using the Total
Variance Diminishing (TVD) scheme. The error covariance associated to the
estimated rain rate is also propagated, and we use these two in the 3D-Var at
the next observation time step. This approach can be seen as a Variational
Kalman Filter (VKF), in which the covariance of the prior is not constant but
dependent on time. The proposed approach has been tested using data from 14
rain gauges, 14 microwave links and the operational radar rain product from
MeteoSwiss in the area of Zurich (Switzerland). During the applications the
assumption of the Lagrangian persistence appears to be valid up to 20 min (a
bit longer for stratiform events). During convective events, the algorithm is
less powerful and shorter lead times should be considered (i.e., 15 min).
Although such lead times are short, they are still useful to various

Due to their ultrashort duration and high charge density, the laser-accelerated
electron bunches are suitable to drive plasma waves at electron densities in
the order of $10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$. We capture the beam-induced plasma dynamics
with femtosecond resolution using few-cycle optical probing and, in addition to
the plasma wave itself, we observe a distinctive transverse ion motion in its

ponderomotive force of the plasma wave acting on the ions, resulting in a
modulation of the plasma density over many picoseconds. Due to the scaling laws

high-current laser-accelerated electron beams can be readily scaled to
low-density systems. Laser-driven PWFA experiments can thus act as miniature

significantly if we add a phase-dependent absorption feature with central

the feature for about half of the pulse cycle. Energy-resolved pulse profiles
support the description of the spectrum with a three-component continuum and an

electron cyclotron line originating in the pulsar magnetosphere and broadened
by the non-uniformity of the magnetic field along the line of sight. The
significant phase-variability in the thermal emission from the entire stellar

associated with the top front of the bright core of a white light coronal mass
ejection (CME). This reveals the potential of using t-IVm imaging data to
continuously track the CME by lighting up the specific component containing
radio-emitting electrons. It is found that the t-IVm burst presents a clear
spatial dispersion with observing frequencies. The burst manifests broken
power-law like spectra in brightness temperature, which is as high as

the t-IVm burst starts during the declining phase of the flare with a duration

cm$^{-3}$ at the start of the burst, and the temperature may reach up to
several MK. These observations do not favor gyro-synchrotron to be the

consider a stationary Maxwell system with the perfect conductivity boundary
conditions. It is assumed that the dielectric permittivity and the magnetic
permeability are given by $\eta({\mathbf x}/ \varepsilon )$ and $\mu({\mathbf
x}/ \varepsilon )$, where $\eta( {\mathbf x})$ and $\mu({\mathbf x})$ are
symmetric $(3 \times 3)$-matrix-valued functions; they are periodic with
respect to some lattice, bounded and positive definite. Here $\varepsilon >0$
is the small parameter. We use the following notation for the solutions of the
Maxwell system: ${\mathbf u}_\varepsilon$ is the electric field intensity,
${\mathbf v}_\varepsilon$ is the magnetic field intensity, ${\mathbf
w}_\varepsilon$ is the electric displacement vector, and ${\mathbf
z}_\varepsilon$ is the magnetic displacement vector. It is known that ${\mathbf
u}_\varepsilon$, ${\mathbf v}_\varepsilon$, ${\mathbf w}_\varepsilon$, and
${\mathbf z}_\varepsilon$ weakly converge in $L_2({\mathcal O})$ to the
corresponding homogenized fields ${\mathbf u}_0$, ${\mathbf v}_0$, ${\mathbf
w}_0$, and ${\mathbf z}_0$ (the solutions of the homogenized Maxwell system
with the effective coefficients), as $\varepsilon \to 0$. We improve the
classical results and find approximations for ${\mathbf u}_\varepsilon$,
${\mathbf v}_\varepsilon$, ${\mathbf w}_\varepsilon$, and ${\mathbf
z}_\varepsilon$ in the $L_2({\mathcal O})$-norm. The error terms do not exceed
$C \sqrt{\varepsilon} (\| {\mathbf q}\|_{L_2}+\|{\mathbf r}\|_{L_2})$, where
the divergence free vector-valued functions ${\mathbf q}$ and ${\mathbf r}$ are
the right-hand sides of the Maxwell equations.

that the labels of two adjacent speech samples in the network are likely to be
the same. However, assuming the pairwise relationship between speech samples is
not complete. The information a group of speech samples that show very similar
patterns and tend to have similar labels is missed. The natural way overcoming
the information loss of the above assumption is to represent the feature data
of speech samples as the hypergraph. Thus, in this paper, the three
un-normalized, random walk, and symmetric normalized hypergraph Laplacian based
semi-supervised learning methods applied to hypergraph constructed from the
feature data of speech samples in order to predict the labels of speech samples
are introduced. Experiment results show that the sensitivity performance
measures of these three hypergraph Laplacian based semi-supervised learning
methods are greater than the sensitivity performance measures of the Hidden
Markov Model method (the current state of the art method applied to speech
recognition problem) and graph based semi-supervised learning methods (i.e. the
current state of the art network-based method for classification problems)

provide contradictory conclusions about the best encoding to use. Here, three
encodings are compared: Sinz's sequential-counter, Bailleux and Boufkhad's
tree-based, and Ab\'{\i}o and coworkers' sort-based approaches. The
sequential-counter approach is found to be the fastest of these for a range of
related, combinatorial test cases. All encodings permit multiple solutions in
the auxiliary variables for a single solution to the main variables; the
numbers of multiple solutions can be very large, and might impede a Sat solver.
Variants of the encodings are developed, where extra clauses reduce the numbers
of multiple solutions. These variants are found to have remarkably little
effect on solution time, even when the number of clauses is approximately
doubled. The results accentuate the well-known observation that clause count
and other measures of encoding size are not reliable indicators of the
difficulty of a Sat problem.

  overlapping domain decomposition","submitted Journal of Computational Physics (28th February 2018)",,,,"physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a novel framework inspired by the Immersed Boundary Method for
predicting the fluid-structure interaction of complex structures immersed in
flows with moderate to high Reynolds numbers. The main novelties of the
proposed fluid-structure interaction framework are 1) the use of elastodynamics
equations for the structure, 2) the use of a high-order Navier-Stokes solver
for the flow, and 3) the variational transfer (L2-projection) for coupling the
solid and fluid subproblems. The dynamic behavior of a deformable structure is
simulated in a finite element framework by adopting a fully implicit scheme for
its temporal integration. It allows for mechanical constitutive laws including
nonhomogeneous and fiber-reinforced materials. The Navier-Stokes equations for
the incompressible flow are discretized with high-order finite differences
which allow for the direct numerical simulation of laminar, transitional and
turbulent flows. The structure and the flow solvers are coupled by using an
L2-projection method for the transfer of velocities and forces between the
fluid grid and the solid mesh. This strategy allows for the numerical solution
of coupled large scale problems based on nonconforming structured and
unstructured grids. The framework is validated with the Turek-Hron benchmark
and a newly proposed benchmark modelling the flow-induced oscillation of an
inert plate. A three-dimensional simulation of an elastic beam in transitional
flow is provided to show the solver's capability of coping with anisotropic
elastic structures immersed in complex fluid flow.

the agents, providing a model for the formation of the bipartite network of
actions and their features. Therefore we only require to know the chronological
order in which the actions are performed, and not the order in which the agents
are observed. Moreover, the total number of possible features is not specified
a priori but is allowed to increase along time, and new actions can
independently show some new entry features or exhibit some of the old ones. The
choice of the old features is driven by a degree-fitness method. With this term
we mean that the probability that a new action shows one of the old features
does not solely depend on the ""popularity"" of that feature (i.e. the number of
previous actions showing it), but is also affected by some individual traits of
the agents or the features themselves, synthesized in certain quantities,
called ""fitnesses"" or ""weights"", that can have different forms and different
meaning according to the specific setting considered. We show some theoretical
properties of the model and provide statistical tools for the parameters'
estimation. The model has been tested on three different datasets and the
numerical results are provided and discussed.

in many application environments to retrieve information and unveil knowledge
from the graphs and network structural properties. However, the algorithms of
such metrics are expensive in terms of computational resources when running
real-time applications or massive real world networks. Thus, approximation
techniques have been developed and used to compute the measures in such
scenarios. In this paper, we demonstrate and analyze the use of neural network
learning algorithms to tackle such task and compare their performance in terms
of solution quality and computation time with other techniques from the
literature. Our work offers several contributions. We highlight both the pros
and cons of approximating centralities though neural learning. By empirical
means and statistics, we then show that the regression model generated with a
feedforward neural networks trained by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is not
only the best option considering computational resources, but also achieves the
best solution quality for relevant applications and large-scale networks.
