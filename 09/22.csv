stars in OCs based on mixed classical surface and asteroseismic parameters. We
evaluated the performances of three widely adopted methods (pure geometrical
fit, maximum likelihood approach, and a single stars fit) in recovering stellar
parameters. Artificial OCs were generated by means of a Monte Carlo procedure
for two different ages (7.5 and 9.0 Gyr) and two different choices of the
number of stars in the RGB evolutionary phase (35 and 80). The geometrical
approach overestimated the age by about 0.3 and 0.2 Gyr for true ages of 7.5
and 9.0 Gyr, respectively. The ML approach provided similar biases (0.1 and 0.2
Gyr) but with a variance reduced by a factor of between two and four with
respect to geometrical fit. The independent fit of single stars showed a very
large variance. The most important difference between geometrical and ML
approaches was the robustness against observational errors. For the geometrical
method, we found that estimations starting from the same sample but with
different Gaussian perturbations on the observables had about 0.3 Gyr random
variability from one Monte Carlo run to another (45% of the intrinsic
variability due to observational errors). On the other hand, for the ML method,
this value was about 65% and 90% of the simulations failed to include the true
parameter values in their estimated 1 sigma credible interval. Finally, we
compared the performance of the three fitting methods for single RGB-star age
estimation. The variability owing to the choice of the fitting method was
minor, being about 15% of the variability caused by observational
uncertainties.

Ideally, we would like to explain a large dataset with as few parameters as

notably, the Least Angle Regression algorithm, or LARS, is a computationally
efficient algorithm that ranks the covariates of a linear model. The algorithm
is further extended to a class of distributions in the generalized linear model
by using properties of the manifold of exponential families as dually flat
manifolds. However this extension assumes that the normalizing constant of the
joint distribution of observations is easy to compute. This is often not the
case, for example the normalizing constant may contain a complicated integral.
We circumvent this issue if the normalizing constant satisfies a holonomic
system, a system of linear partial differential equations with a
finite-dimensional space of solutions. In this paper we present a modification
of the holonomic gradient method and add it to the extended LARS algorithm. We
call this the holonomic extended least angle regression algorithm, or HELARS.
The algorithm was implemented using the statistical software R, and was tested

to play a significant role in the development and design of new reconfigurable
planar THz nonlinear devices. In this work, we present a novel class of
ultrathin nonlinear hybrid planar THz devices based on graphene-covered
plasmonic gratings exhibiting very large nonlinear response. The robust
localization and enhancement of the electric field along the graphene
monolayer, combined with the large nonlinear conductivity of graphene, can lead
to boosted third harmonic generation (THG) and four-wave mixing (FWM) nonlinear
processes at THz frequencies. These interesting nonlinear effects exhibit very
high nonlinear conversion efficiencies and are triggered by realistic input
intensities with relative low values. In addition, the THG and FWM processes
can be significantly tuned by the dimensions of the proposed hybrid structures,
the doping level of graphene, or the input intensity values, whereas the
nonlinear radiated power remains relatively insensitive to the incident angle
of the excitation source. The presented nonlinear hybrid graphene-covered
plasmonic gratings have a relative simple geometry and can be used to realize
efficient third-order THz effects with a limited fabrication complexity.
Several new nonlinear THz devices are envisioned based on the proposed hybrid

processors, and wave mixers. These devices are expected to be useful for
nonlinear THz spectroscopy, noninvasive THz subwavelength imaging, and THz

  Systems","Camera Ready EMNLP 2018",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Existing dialog datasets contain a sequence of utterances and responses
without any explicit background knowledge associated with them. This has
resulted in the development of models which treat conversation as a
sequence-to-sequence generation task i.e, given a sequence of utterances
generate the response sequence). This is not only an overly simplistic view of
conversation but it is also emphatically different from the way humans converse
by heavily relying on their background knowledge about the topic (as opposed to
simply relying on the previous sequence of utterances). For example, it is
common for humans to (involuntarily) produce utterances which are copied or
suitably modified from background articles they have read about the topic. To
facilitate the development of such natural conversation models which mimic the
human process of conversing, we create a new dataset containing movie chats
wherein each response is explicitly generated by copying and/or modifying
sentences from unstructured background knowledge such as plots, comments and
reviews about the movie. We establish baseline results on this dataset (90K
utterances from 9K conversations) using three different models: (i) pure
generation based models which ignore the background knowledge (ii) generation
based models which learn to copy information from the background knowledge when
required and (iii) span prediction based models which predict the appropriate
response span in the background knowledge.

  Battlefield Things",,,,,"cs.IT cs.GT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, the problem of secure sensor activation is studied for an
Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) system in which an attacker compromises a
set of the IoBT sensors for the purpose of eavesdropping and acquiring
information about the battlefield. In the considered model, each IoBT sensor
seeks to decide whether to transmit or not based on its utility. The utility of
each sensor is expressed in terms of the redundancy of the data transmitted,
the secrecy capacity and the energy consumed. Due to the limited communication
range of the IoBT sensors and their uncertainty about the location of the
eavesdroppers, the problem is formulated as a graphical Bayesian game in which
the IoBT sensors are the players. Then, the utilities of the IoBT sensors are
modified to take into account the effect of activating each sensor on the
utilities of its neighbors, in order to achieve better system performance. The
modified game is shown to be a Bayesian potential game, and a best response
algorithm that is guaranteed to find a Nash equilibrium of the game is
proposed. Simulation results show the tradeoff between the information
transmitted by the IoBT sensors and the desired secrecy level. Simulation
results also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing
the energy consumed compared to the baseline in which all the IoBT sensors are
activated. The reduction in energy consumption reaches up to 98% compared to
the baseline, when the number of sensors is 5000.

the outcomes are consistent with those from the numerical simulations. The

of eccentricities of planetary orbits, whereas tidal effects primarily affects
the eccentricity of Proxima b over long timescale. Moreover, using the MEGNO
(the Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits) technique, we place
dynamical constraints on orbital parameters that result in stable or
quasi-periodic motions for coplanar and non-coplanar configurations. In the
coplanar case, we find that the orbit of Proxima b is stable for the semi-major

network are chosen at random as well, though with probabilities that may depend
on degree. We pitch various hide and seek strategies against each other, and
determine the efficiency of search strategies by computing the average number
of hidden items that a searcher will uncover in a random walk of $n$ steps. Our
analysis is based on the cavity method for finite single instances of the
problem, and generalises previous work of De Bacco et al. [1] so as to cover
degree-biased random walks. We also extend the analysis to deal with the
thermodynamic limit of infinite system size. We study a broad spectrum of
functional forms for the degree bias of both the hiding and the search strategy
and investigate the efficiency of families of search strategies for cases where
their functional form is either matched or unmatched to that of the hiding
strategy. Our results are in excellent agreement with those of numerical

quantities including both rotational motions and genuine dispersion. To
illustrate the new parameter space in the intermediate redshift regime probed
by LEGA-C we explore relationships between dynamical and stellar population

dispersions of ~150 km/s and strong Hdelta absorption (Hd_A ~ 5 Angstrom),
while passive galaxies have higher observed stellar velocity dispersions ~200
km/s and weak Hdelta absortion (Hd_A ~ 0 Angstrom). Strong [O III]5007 / Hbeta
ratios tend to occur mostly for galaxies with weak Hd_A or galaxies with higher
observed velocity dispersion. Beyond these broad trends, we find a large
diversity of possible combinations of rest-frame colors, absorption line
strengths and emission line detections, illustrating the utility of
spectroscopic measurements to more accurately understand galaxy evolution. By

The circulation as a measure of the spin for a neutron star in a binary system
has the advantage of being exactly calculable since it is a local quantity. To
assess the different measures of spin, such as the angular velocity of the
star, the quasilocal, dimensionless spin parameter $J/M^2$, or the circulation
$\mathcal{C}$, we first compute sequences of single, uniformly rotating stars
and describe how the different spin diagnostics are related to each other. The
connection to spinning binary systems is accomplished through the concept of
circulation and the use of the constant rotational velocity formulation.
Finally, we explore a modification of the latter formulation that naturally
leads to differentially rotating binary systems.

IllustrisTNG model has some difficulty with more stringent tests, such as
producing a strong morphology-colour relation. This results in a somewhat
higher fraction of red discs and blue spheroids compared to observations.
Similarly, the morphology-size relation is problematic: while observations show
that discs tend to be larger than spheroids at a fixed stellar mass, such a
trend is not present in IllustrisTNG.

structures seen in galaxy redshift surveys. However, despite their baryon
content being dominated by hot gas, these filaments have been an elusive target
for X-ray observations. Recently, detections of filaments in very deep (2.4
Msec) observations with Chandra were reported around Abell 133 (z=0.0559). To
verify these claims, we conducted a multi-object spectrographic campaign on the
Baade 6.5m telescope around Abell 133; this resulted in a catalog of
${\sim}3000$ new redshift measurements, of which 254 are of galaxies near the
cluster. We investigate the kinematic state of Abell 133 and identify the
physical locations of filamentary structure in the galaxy distribution.
Contrary to previous studies, we see no evidence that Abell 133 is dynamically
disturbed; we reject the hypothesis that there is a kinematically distinct
subgroup (p=0.28) and find no velocity offset between the central galaxy and
the cluster ($\textrm{Z}_\textrm{score}=0.041^{+0.111}_{-0.106}$). The spatial
distribution of galaxies traces the X-ray filaments, as confirmed by angular
cross correlation with a significance of ${\sim}5\sigma$. A similar agreement
is found in the angular density distribution, where two X-ray structures have
corresponding galaxy enhancements. We also identify filaments in the
large-scale structure of galaxies; these filaments approach the cluster from
the direction the X-ray structures are seen. While more members between
$\textrm{R}_{200}$ and $2\times\textrm{R}_{200}$ are required to clarify which
large scale filaments connect to the X-ray gas, we argue that this is
compelling evidence that the X-ray emission is indeed associated with cosmic
filaments.

transition and the resulting gravitational wave (GW) signal? While naively one
might expect that supercooling could increase the strength of the transition to
very high values, for strong supercooling the Universe is no longer
radiation-dominated and the vacuum energy of the unstable minimum of the
potential dominates the expansion, which can jeopardize the successful
completion of the phase transition. After providing a general treatment for the
nucleation, growth and percolation of broken phase bubbles during a first-order
phase transition that encompasses the case of significant supercooling, we
study the conditions for successful bubble percolation and completion of the
electroweak phase transition in theories beyond the Standard Model featuring
polynominal potentials. For such theories, these conditions set a lower bound
on the temperature of the transition. Since the plasma cannot be significantly
diluted, the resulting GW signal originates mostly from sound waves and
turbulence in the plasma, rather than bubble collisions. We find the peak
frequency of the GW signal from the phase transition to be generically $f
\gtrsim 10^{-4}$ Hz. We also study the condition for GW production by sound
waves to be long-lasting (GW source active for approximately a Hubble time),
showing it is generally not fulfilled in concrete scenarios. Because of this
the sound wave GW signal could be weakened, with turbulence setting in earlier,
resulting in a smaller overall GW signal as compared to current literature
predictions.

The second Gaia data release (Gaia DR2) contains high precision
positions, parallaxes and proper motions for 1.3 billion sources. The resulting
Hertzsprung-Russel diagram reveals fine structures all over the mass range.
  Aims. This paper aims to investigate the content of Gaia DR2 at the low-mass
end and to characterize ultra-cool and brown dwarfs.
  Methods. We first retrieve the sample of spectroscopically confirmed
ultra-cool and brown dwarfs in Gaia DR2. We use their locus in the precise
Hertzsprung-Russel diagram to select new candidates, and to investigate their
properties.
  Results. The number of spectroscopically confirmed objects recovered in Gaia
DR2 corresponds to 62 %, and 71 %, of the expected number of objects with and
estimated Gaia magnitude Gest $\leq$ 21.5, and 20.3, respectively,
significantly filling the gap with Gaia DR1. Furthermore Gaia DR2 contains ~13
000 $\geq$M7 and 679 new L candidates. A tentative classification suggests that
a few hundreds are young or subdwarf candidates. Their distance distribution
shows that the solar neighborhood census is still incomplete.
  Conclusions. Gaia DR2 offers a great wealth of information on the low-mass
objects. It provide a homogeneous and precise catalog of candidates worthwhile
to be further characterized with spectroscopic observations.

horizontal branch (BHB) stars. These stars are identified photometrically using
deep $u-$band imaging from the new Canada-France-Imaging-Survey (CFIS) that
reaches 24.5 mag. This is combined with $griz$ bands from Pan-STARRS 1 and
covers a total of $\sim4000$ deg$^2$ of the northern sky. We present a new
method to select BHB stars that has low contamination from blue stragglers and
high completeness. We use this sample to measure and parameterize the three
dimensional density profile of the outer stellar halo. We fit the profile using
(i) a simple power-law with a constant flattening (ii) a flattening that varies
as a function of Galactocentric radius (iii) a broken power law profile. We
find that outer stellar halo traced by the BHB is well modelled by a broken
power law with a constant flattening of $q=0.86 \pm 0.02$, with an inner slope
of $\gamma=4.24 \pm 0.08$. This is much steeper than the preferred outer
profile that has a slope of $\beta=3.21\pm 0.07$ after a break radius of
$r_b=41.4^{+2.5}_{-2.4}$ kpc. The outer profile of the stellar halo trace by

frequentist detection threshold (i.e. contrast curve) and associated
completeness. This can lead to conceptual inconsistencies when included in a
Bayesian framework. A Bayesian upper limit is such that the true value of a

messages to $n$ clients within the same broadcast domain. Each client already
has some messages as side information and requests a particular unknown message
from the server. All clients learn the coding matrix so that they can decode
and retrieve their requested data. Our starting observation is that, learning
the coding matrix can pose privacy concerns: it may enable a client to infer
information about the requests and side information of other clients. In this
paper, we mitigate this privacy concern by allowing each client to have limited
access to the coding matrix. In particular, we design coding matrices so that
each client needs only to learn some of (and not all) the rows to decode her
requested message. By means of two different privacy metrics, we first show
that this approach indeed increases the level of privacy. Based on this, we
propose the use of $k$-limited-access schemes: given an index coding scheme
that employs $T$ transmissions, we create a $k$-limited-access scheme with
$T_k\geq T$ transmissions, and with the property that each client needs at most
$k$ transmissions to decode her message. We derive upper and lower bounds on
$T_k$ for all values of $k$, and develop deterministic designs for these
schemes, which are universal, i.e., independent of the coding matrix. We show
that our schemes are order-optimal when either $k$ or $n$ is large. Moreover,
we propose heuristics that complement the universal schemes for the case when

this paper, we study a two-dimensional dilaton gravity model coupled to a
conformal field, in which the distribution of vacuum fluctuations is well
understood. In this model, the fluctuations of the matter field are responsible
for the fluctuations of the geometry itself. By analyzing the geodesic

microorganisms evolved much earlier in Earth history than those of surface
dwelling phototrophic microorganisms,the emergence of the former occurred at a
time when Mars was habitable, whereas that of the latter occurred at a time
when the martian surface would have been uninhabitable, subsurface biomass do
not correlate with organic carbon and tends to be highest at interfaces where
chemical redox gradients are most pronounced, deep subsurface metabolic
activity does not rely upon the respiration of organic photosynthate but upon
the flux of inorganic energy and the abiotic and biotic recycling of metabolic
waste products, and the rock record reveals examples of subsurface life back to
3.45 Ga with several examples of good preservation potential in rock types that
are quite different from those preserving the photospheric supported
biosphere.These findings suggest that rock hosted life would have likely to
emerge and be preserved in a martian context. We thus propose a Mars
exploration strategy that scales spatially, focusing initially on identifying
rocks with evidence for groundwater flow and low temperature mineralization,
then identifying redox and permeability interfaces preserved within rock
outcrops, and finally focusing on finding minerals associated with redox
reactions and traces of carbon and diagnostic biosignatures. The lessons from
Earth show that ancient rock hosted life is preserved in the fossil record and
confirmable via a suite of morphologic, organic, mineralogical and isotopic
fingerprints and microscopic textures.

on these foundations for a class of systems of paradigmatic importance that
appear frequently as mean-field models in condensed matter physics, namely
non-interacting lattice models of fermions (with straightforward extension to
bosons). We demonstrate that already the translation invariance of the
Hamiltonian governing the dynamics and a finite correlation length of the
possibly non-Gaussian initial state provide sufficient structure to make
mathematically precise statements about the equilibration of the system towards
a generalized Gibbs ensemble, even for highly non-translation invariant initial
states far from ground states of non-interacting models. Whenever these are
given, the system will equilibrate rapidly according to a power-law in time as
long as there are no long-wavelength dislocations in the initial second moments
that would render the system resilient to relaxation. Our proof technique is
rooted in the machinery of Kusmin-Landau bounds. Subsequently, we numerically
illustrate our analytical findings by discussing quench scenarios with an
initial state corresponding to an Anderson insulator observing power-law
equilibration. We discuss the implications of the results for the understanding
of current quantum simulators, both in how one can understand the behaviour of
equilibration in time, as well as concerning perspectives for realizing
distinct instances of generalized Gibbs ensembles in optical lattice-based

fate and physiology, genes alone cannot predict cellular phenotype. During the
process of gene expression, 95% of human genes can code for multiple proteins
due to alternative splicing. While most splice variants of a gene carry the
same function, variants within some key genes can have remarkably different
roles. To bridge the gap between genotype and phenotype, condition- and
tissue-specific models of metabolism have been constructed. However, current
metabolic models only include information at the gene level. Consequently, as
recently acknowledged by the scientific community, common situations where
changes in splice-isoform expression levels alter the metabolic outcome cannot
be modeled. Results: We here propose GEMsplice, the first method for the
incorporation of splice-isoform expression data into genome-scale metabolic
models. Using GEMsplice, we make full use of RNA-Seq quantitative expression
profiles to predict, for the first time, the effects of splice isoform-level
changes in the metabolism of 1455 patients with 31 different breast cancer
types. We validate GEMsplice by generating cancer-versus-normal predictions on
metabolic pathways, and by comparing with gene-level approaches and available
literature on pathways affected by breast cancer. GEMsplice is freely available

we extend fully the lateral band-transmission picture, thus quantum

Jeopardy, establishes two orthogonal dimensions of question difficulty:
obscurity (the rarity of the answer) and opacity (the indirectness of question
cues, operationalized with word2vec). The importance of opacity, and the role
of synergistic information in resolving it, suggests that accounts of
difficulty in terms of prior expectations captures only a part of the
question-asking process. A further regression analysis shows the presence of
additional dimensions to question-asking: question complexity, the answer's
local network density, cue intersection, and the presence of signal words. Our
work shows how question-askers can help their interlocutors by using contextual
cues, or, conversely, how a particular kind of unfamiliarity with the domain in
question can make it harder for individuals to learn from others. Taken
together, these results suggest how Bayesian models of question difficulty can
be supplemented by process models and accounts of the heuristics individuals
use to navigate conceptual spaces.

problem of having a large number of types of power and also a large number of
forms of motivation by directly taking into account the effects on the welfare
of each subject, regardless of the means with which they are achieved: that is,
referring to everything that happens in the negotiation process to the
potential or real variations of the welfare function induced in each subject
due to the exercise of the specific form of power, on a case by case basis, and

relatively limited. As in the single-agent case, only very specialized dynamic
games can be solved exactly, and so approximation algorithms are required. This
paper extends the differential dynamic programming algorithm from single-agent
control to the case of non-zero sum full-information dynamic games. The method
works by computing quadratic approximations to the dynamic programming
equations. The approximation results in static quadratic games which are solved
recursively. Convergence is proved by showing that the algorithm iterates
sufficiently close to iterates of Newton's method to inherit its convergence
properties. A numerical example is provided.

RFeII between the FeII emission blend at 4570 \AA\ and Hb, RFeII $\gt$ 1.
Composite spectra were analyzed for systematic trends as a function of FeII
strength, line width, and [OIII] strength. We introduced tighter constraints on
the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and RFeII values that allowed us to isolate
sources most likely to be extreme accretors. We provide a database of detailed

blueshifts as related to the signature of outflowing gas from the quasar

however, the effect is non-negligible if the FWHM Hb is used as a 'virial
broadening estimator'. A effect of the viewing angle on Hb broadening, deriving
a correction for those sources that shows disagreement between virial and

of very weak solutions to the forward problem of determining the displacement
by imposing traction-free boundary conditions at the surface, continuity of the
traction and a given jump on the displacement across the fault. We employ
suitable weighted Sobolev spaces for the analysis. We utilize the well
posedness of the forward problem and unique-continuation arguments to establish
uniqueness in the inverse problem of determining the dislocation surface and
the displacement jump from measuring the displacement at the surface of the
Earth. Uniqueness holds for tangential or normal jumps and under some geometric
conditions on the surface.

Existing techniques have used supervised machine learning for this task. In
this paper, we look this problem from an attacker's perspective. We aim to
modify a test binary, such that it not only causes misprediction but also
maintains the functionality of the original input binary. Attacks against
binary code are intrinsically more difficult than attacks against domains such
as computer vision, where attackers can change each pixel of the input image
independently and still maintain a valid image. For binary code, even flipping
one bit of a binary may cause the binary to be invalid, to crash at the
run-time, or to lose the original functionality. We investigate two types of
attacks: untargeted attacks, causing misprediction to any of the incorrect
authors, and targeted attacks, causing misprediction to a specific one among
the incorrect authors. We develop two key attack capabilities: feature vector
modification, generating an adversarial feature vector that both corresponds to
a real binary and causes the required misprediction, and input binary
modification, modifying the input binary to match the adversarial feature
vector while maintaining the functionality of the input binary. We evaluated
our attack against classifiers trained with a state-of-the-art method for
authorship attribution. The classifiers for authorship identification have 91%
accuracy on average. Our untargeted attack has a 96% success rate on average,
showing that we can effectively suppress authorship signal. Our targeted attack
has a 46% success rate on average, showing that it is possible, but
significantly more difficult to impersonate a specific programmer's style. Our
attack reveals that existing binary code authorship identification techniques
rely on code features that are easy to modify, and thus are vulnerable to
attacks.

care about, in a single request. However, providers of existing REST(-like)

challenges for creating such wrappers, including dealing with data sanitation,
authentication, or handling nested queries. We furthermore present a
prototypical implementation of OASGraph. OASGraph takes as input an OpenAPI
Specification (OAS) describing an existing REST(-like) web API and generates a
GraphQL wrapper for it. We evaluate OASGraph by running it, as well as an
existing open source alternative, against 959 publicly available OAS. This
experiment shows that OASGraph outperforms the existing alternative and is able
to create a GraphQL wrapper for 89.5% of the APIs -- however, with limitations
in many cases. A subsequent analysis of errors and warnings produced by
OASGraph shows that missing or ambiguous information in the assessed OAS
hinders creating complete wrappers. Finally, we present a use case of the IBM
Watson Language Translator API that shows that small changes to an OAS allow
OASGraph to generate more idiomatic and more expressive GraphQL wrappers.

alternative way of solving partial differential equations (PDEs) without the

implementation. In particular, in addition to the deep neural network (DNN) for
the solution, a second DNN is considered that represents the residual of the
PDE. The residual is then combined with the mismatch in the given data of the
solution in order to formulate the loss function. This framework is effective
but is lacking uncertainty quantification of the solution due to the inherent
randomness in the data or due to the approximation limitations of the DNN
architecture. Here, we propose a new method with the objective of endowing the
DNN with uncertainty quantification for both sources of uncertainty, i.e., the
parametric uncertainty and the approximation uncertainty. We first account for
the parametric uncertainty when the parameter in the differential equation is
represented as a stochastic process. Multiple DNNs are designed to learn the
modal functions of the arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC) expansion of its
solution by using stochastic data from sparse sensors. We can then make
predictions from new sensor measurements very efficiently with the trained
DNNs. Moreover, we employ dropout to correct the over-fitting and also to
quantify the uncertainty of DNNs in approximating the modal functions. We then
design an active learning strategy based on the dropout uncertainty to place
new sensors in the domain to improve the predictions of DNNs. Several numerical
tests are conducted for both the forward and the inverse problems to quantify
the effectiveness of PINNs combined with uncertainty quantification. This
NN-aPC new paradigm of physics-informed deep learning with uncertainty
quantification can be readily applied to other types of stochastic PDEs in
multi-dimensions.

detector's decision is to place $f$ sensors to detect the presence of the
attack signals. In our formulation, the attacker minimizes its visibility,
defined as the system $L_2$ gain from the attack signals to the deployed
sensors' outputs, and the detector maximizes the visibility of the attack
signals. The equilibrium strategy of the game determines the optimal locations
of the sensors. The existence of Nash equilibrium for the attacker-detector
game is studied when the underlying connectivity graph is a directed or an
undirected tree. When the game does not admit a Nash equilibrium, it is shown
that the Stackelberg equilibrium of the game, with the detector as the game
leader, can be computed efficiently. Finally, the attacker-detector game is

characterization of observations of atomic and molecular gas and the study of

extended spectral-line observations from two tracers and provides an estimate
of their spatial correlation across velocity channels.
  We characterize HOG using synthetic observations of HI and $^{13}$CO(J=1-0)
emission from numerical simulations of MHD turbulence leading to the formation
of molecular gas after the collision of two atomic clouds. We find a
significant spatial correlation between the two tracers in velocity channels
where $v_{HI}\approx v_{^{13}CO}$, independent of the orientation of the
collision with respect to the line of sight.
  We use HOG to investigate the spatial correlation of the HI, from the THOR
survey, and the $^{13}$CO(J=1-0) emission, from the GRS, toward the portion of
the Galactic plane 33.75$\lt l\lt$35.25$^{o}$ and $|b|\lt$1.25$^{o}$. We find a
significant spatial correlation between the tracers in extended portions of the
studied region. Although some of the regions with high spatial correlation are
associated with HI self-absorption features, suggesting that it is produced by
the cold atomic gas, the correlation is not exclusive to this kind of region.
The HOG results also indicate significant differences between individual
regions: some show spatial correlation in channels around $v_{HI}\approx
v_{^{13}CO}$ while others present this correlation in velocity channels
separated by a few km/s. We associate these velocity offsets to the effect of
feedback and to the presence of physical conditions that are not included in

configurations, shear, and global gas infall.

quasars. For two quasars of sufficient redshift at opposite directions on the

And if those photons are used to set parameters in an Earth-based apparatus,
coincidence cannot be due to their communication, closing the so-called
""freedom of choice"" loophole in the experiment. But this assumes no other
interference right up to detection, including correlated instrumental errors,
which must be carefully constrained. The Gemini North and South Multi-Object
Spectrograph (GMOS) twins can simultaneously view pairs of quasars up to 180
degrees apart on the sky, and already provide a significant baseline record to
investigate this. All GMOS broadband imaging frames were searched to find those
that happen to contain a known quasar together with a suitable comparison star.
Although individual photometry can be noisy among these 0.1 < z < 6 sources, in
the aggregate, average site conditions and their relative photometric
zeropoints are well characterized. The resulting dataset constitutes about 2
million correlated quasar-observation pairs over 14 years. A preliminary
analysis of that is presented, with the intriguing result that paired-flux
differences across the whole sky weakly deviate from flatness, to the limit
consistent with Bell's Theorem. Can Gemini be used to prove the ""spooky action

how to acquire coherent field maps for direct detector arrays was demonstrated
in Davis et. al. 2017. This technique has the ability to determine both
amplitude and phase radiation patterns from individual pixels on an array.
Phase information helps to better characterize the optical performance of the

in an additional plane [4].
  Here we discuss the mathematical framework used in an analysis pipeline
developed to process complex field radiation pattern measurements. This routine
determines and compensates misalignments of the instrument and scanning system.
We begin with an overview of Gaussian beam formalism and how it relates to
complex field pattern measurements. Next we discuss a scan strategy using an
offset in z along the optical axis that allows first-order optical standing
waves between the scanned source and optical system to be removed in
post-processing. Also discussed is a method by which the co- and
cross-polarization fields can be extracted individually for each pixel by
rotating the two orthogonal measurement planes until the signal is the
co-polarization map is maximized (and the signal in the cross-polarization
field is minimized). We detail a minimization function that can fit measurement

is caused by diffusion of electrons or holes in a temperature gradient.
However, the Seebeck effect can also have a phonon drag component, due to
momentum exchange between charge carriers and lattice phonons, which is more
difficult to quantify. Here, we present the first study of phonon drag in the
AlGaN/GaN two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). We find that phonon drag does
not contribute significantly to the thermoelectric behavior of devices with
~100 nm GaN thickness, which suppress the phonon mean free path. However, when
the thickness is increased to ~1.2 $\mu$m, up to 32% (88%) of the Seebeck
coefficient at 300 K (50 K) can be attributed to the drag component. In turn,
the phonon drag enables state-of-the-art thermoelectric power factor in the
thicker GaN film, up to ~40 mW m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ at 50 K. By measuring the
thermal conductivity of these AlGaN/GaN films, we show that the magnitude of
the phonon drag can increase even when the thermal conductivity decreases.
Decoupling of thermal conductivity and Seebeck coefficient could enable
important advancements in thermoelectric power conversion with devices based on
2DEGs.

these agents to not only maximize their reward in an environment, but also to
learn and follow the implicit constraints of society. These constraints and
norms can come from any number of sources including regulations, business
process guidelines, laws, ethical principles, social norms, and moral values.
We detail a novel approach that uses inverse reinforcement learning to learn a
set of unspecified constraints from demonstrations of the task, and
reinforcement learning to learn to maximize the environment rewards. More
precisely, we assume that an agent can observe traces of behavior of members of
the society but has no access to the explicit set of constraints that give rise
to the observed behavior. Inverse reinforcement learning is used to learn such
constraints, that are then combined with a possibly orthogonal value function
through the use of a contextual bandit-based orchestrator that picks a
contextually-appropriate choice between the two policies (constraint-based and
environment reward-based) when taking actions. The contextual bandit
orchestrator allows the agent to mix policies in novel ways, taking the best
actions from either a reward maximizing or constrained policy. In addition, the
orchestrator is transparent on which policy is being employed at each time
step. We test our algorithms using a Pac-Man domain and show that the agent is
able to learn to act optimally, act within the demonstrated constraints, and
mix these two functions in complex ways.

introducing bias in the sampling process which is guided by transitions in the

Representing, learning, and reasoning with preferences is an important area of
study both within computer science and across the sciences. When working with
preferences it is necessary to understand and compute the distance between sets
of objects, e.g., the preferences of a user and a the descriptions of objects
to be recommended. We present CPDist, a novel neural network to address the
problem of learning to measure the distance between structured preference
representations. We use the popular CP-net formalism to represent preferences
and then leverage deep neural networks to learn a recently proposed metric
function that is computationally hard to compute directly. CPDist is a novel
metric learning approach based on the use of deep siamese networks which learn
the Kendal Tau distance between partial orders that are induced by compact
preference representations. We find that CPDist is able to learn the distance
function with high accuracy and outperform existing approximation algorithms on
both the regression and classification task using less computation time.
Performance remains good even when CPDist is trained with only a small number
of samples compared to the dimension of the solution space, indicating the
network generalizes well.

uncovering the underlying structure in heterogeneous datasets. Single and
coupled matrix-tensor factorization (CMTF) has been widely used in this context
for imputation-based recommendation from ratings, social network, and other
user-item data. When this side information is in the form of item-item
correlation matrices or graphs, existing CMTF algorithms may fall short.
Alleviating current limitations, we introduce a novel model coined coupled
graph-tensor factorization (CGTF) that judiciously accounts for graph-related
side information. The CGTF model has the potential to overcome practical
challenges, such as missing slabs from the tensor and/or missing rows/columns
from the correlation matrices. A novel alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) is also developed that recovers the nonnegative factors of
CGTF. Our algorithm enjoys closed-form updates that result in reduced
computational complexity and allow for convergence claims. A novel direction is
further explored by employing the interpretable factors to detect graph
communities having the tensor as side information. The resulting community
detection approach is successful even when some links in the graphs are
missing. Results with real data sets corroborate the merits of the proposed
methods relative to state-of-the-art competing factorization techniques in
providing recommendations and detecting communities.

\bpic b is the closest (semi-major axis $\simeq$\,9\,au) exoplanet that has
been imaged to orbit a star. Thus it offers unique opportunities for detailed
studies of its orbital, physical, and atmospheric properties, and of
disk-planet interactions. With the exception of the discovery observations in
2003 with NaCo at the Very Large Telescope (VLT), all following astrometric
measurements relative to \bpic have been obtained in the southwestern part of
the orbit, which severely limits the determination of the planet's orbital
parameters. We aimed at further constraining \bpic b orbital properties using
more data, and, in particular, data taken in the northeastern part of the
orbit.
  We used SPHERE at the VLT to precisely monitor the orbital motion of beta
\bpic b since first light of the instrument in 2014. We were able to monitor
the planet until November 2016, when its angular separation became too small
(125 mas, i.e., 1.6\,au) and prevented further detection. We redetected \bpic b
on the northeast side of the disk at a separation of 139\,mas and a PA of
30$^{\circ}$ in September 2018. The planetary orbit is now well constrained.
With a semi-major axis (sma) of $a = 9.0 \pm 0.5$ au (1 $\sigma $), it
definitely excludes previously reported possible long orbital periods, and
excludes \bpic b as the origin of photometric variations that took place in
1981. We also refine the eccentricity and inclination of the planet. From an
instrumental point of view, these data demonstrate that it is possible to
detect, if they exist, young massive Jupiters that orbit at less than 2 au from
a star that is 20 pc away.

initialized with two magnetic islands embedded in a reconnecting current sheet.
The two islands collide and eventually merge into a single island. Particles
are accelerated during this process as the magnetic energy is released and
converted to the plasma energy, including bulk kinetic energy increase by the
ideal electric field, and thermal energy increase by the fluid compression and
the non-ideal electric field. We find that contributions from these different
energization mechanisms are all important and comparable with each other. Fluid
shear and a non-gyrotropic pressure tensor also contribute to the energy
conversion process. For simulations with different box sizes ranging from $L_x
\sim 25$--$100 d_i$ and ion-to-electron mass ratios $m_i / m_e = 25$, 100 and

ratio. The results may help us understand plasma energization in solar and

principal ways to boost the capacity of wireless networks. However, the
complicated distributions of the signal power and the accumulated interference
power, largely induced by various space-time processing techniques, make it
highly challenging to quantitatively characterize the performance of
multi-antenna networks. In this paper, using tools from stochastic geometry, a
unified framework is developed for the analysis of such networks. The major
results are two innovative representations of the coverage probability, which
make the analysis of multi-antenna networks almost as tractable as the
single-antenna case. One is expressed as an $\ell_1$-induced norm of a Toeplitz
matrix, and the other is given in a finite sum form. With a compact
representation, the former incorporates many existing analytical results on
single- and multi-antenna networks as special cases, and leads to tractable
expressions for evaluating the coverage probability in both ad hoc and cellular
networks. While the latter is more complicated for numerical evaluation, it
helps analytically gain key design insights. In particular, it helps prove that
the coverage probability of ad hoc networks is a monotonically decreasing
convex function of the transmitter density and that there exists a peak value
of the coverage improvement when increasing the number of transmit antennas. On
the other hand, in multi-antenna cellular networks, it is shown that the
coverage probability is independent of the transmitter density and that the
outage probability decreases exponentially as the number of transmit antennas
increases.

in gang or terrorist networks, are adversarial, with another party incentivized
to minimize its effectiveness by manipulating observed information about the
network. We offer a comprehensive algorithmic investigation of the problem of
attacking similarity-based link prediction through link deletion, focusing on
two broad classes of such approaches, one which uses only local information
about target links, and another which uses global network information. While we
show several variations of the general problem to be NP-Hard for both local and
global metrics, we exhibit a number of well-motivated special cases which are
tractable. Additionally, we provide principled and empirically effective
algorithms for the intractable cases, in some cases proving worst-case
approximation guarantees.

standard supervised learning is used. On unlabeled examples, CVT teaches
auxiliary prediction modules that see restricted views of the input (e.g., only

CVT is particularly effective when combined with multi-task learning. We
evaluate CVT on five sequence tagging tasks, machine translation, and
dependency parsing, achieving state-of-the-art results.

reasonable interference isolation, millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications has
emerged as a promising solution for wireless personal-area networks (WPAN) and
an enabler for emerging applications such as high-resolution untethered virtual
reality. At mmWave, signals are prone to blockage by objects in the
environment, including human bodies. Most mmWave systems utilize directional
antennas in order to overcome the significant path loss. In this paper, we
consider the effects of blockage and antenna directivity on the performance of
a mmWave WPAN. Similar to related work, we assume that the interferers are in
arbitrary locations and the blockages are drawn from a random point process.
However, unlike related work that assumes independent blocking, we carefully
account for the possibility of correlated blocking, which arises when two
interferers are close to each other and therefore an obstruction that blocks
the first interferer may likely block the second interferer. Closed form
expressions for the blockage correlation coefficient and the distribution of
the SINR are provided for the case of two dominant interferers and a fixed
number of blockages drawn from a binomial point process. Finally, the effects
of antenna directivity and the spatial randomness of the interferers are taken
into account, resulting in SINR curves that fully account for correlated
blocking, which are compared against curves that neglect correlation. The
results provide insight into the validity of the commonly held assumption of
independent blocking and the improved accuracy that can be obtained when the
blocking correlation is taken into account.

disproportionate number of features than cannot be confidently assigned to a
chemical structure. This inadequacy is driven by the single most significant
limitation in metabolomics: the reliance on reference libraries constructed by
analysis of authentic reference chemicals. To this end, we have developed the
in silico chemical library engine (ISiCLE), a high-performance
computing-friendly cheminformatics workflow for generating libraries of
chemical properties. In the instantiation described here, we predict probable
three-dimensional molecular conformers using chemical identifiers as input,
from which collision cross sections (CCS) are derived. The approach employs
state-of-the-art first-principles simulation, distinguished by use of molecular
dynamics, quantum chemistry, and ion mobility calculations to generate
structures and libraries, all without training data. Importantly, optimization
of ISiCLE included a refactoring of the popular MOBCAL code for
trajectory-based mobility calculations, improving its computational efficiency
by over two orders of magnitude. Calculated CCS values were validated against
1,983 experimentally-measured CCS values and compared to previously reported
CCS calculation approaches. An online database is introduced for sharing both
calculated and experimental CCS values (metabolomics.pnnl.gov), initially
including a CCS library with over 1 million entries. Finally, three successful

the planetary radii and orbital periods of over 2800 $Kepler$ candidates from
the latest $Kepler$ data release DR25 (Q1-Q17) with revised planetary radii
based on $Gaia$~DR2 as a function of host star metallicity (from the Q1-Q17

radius measurements, we are able to reconfirm previous results in the

the radius of the planet increases. We demonstrate this by first calculating
the average host star metallicity for different radius bins and then
supplementing these results by calculating the occurrence rate as a function of
planetary radius and host star metallicity. We find a similar trend between
host star metallicity and planet mass: the average host star metallicity
increases with increasing planet mass. This trend, however, reverses for masses
$> 4.0\, M_\mathrm{J}$: host star metallicity drops with increasing planetary
mass. We further examined the correlation between the host star metallicity and

  Consensus Management Using Reputation and Contract Theory","12 pages, submitted for possible journal publication",,,,"cs.CR cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In Internet of Vehicles (IoV), data sharing among vehicles is essential to
improve driving safety and enhance vehicular services. To ensure data sharing
security and traceability, highefficiency Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus
scheme as a hard security solution is utilized to establish blockchain-enabled
IoV (BIoV). However, as miners are selected from miner candidates by
stake-based voting, it is difficult to defend against voting collusion between
the candidates and compromised high-stake vehicles, which introduces serious
security challenges to the BIoV. To address such challenges, we propose a soft
security enhancement solution including two stages: (i) miner selection and
(ii) block verification. In the first stage, a reputation-based voting scheme
for the blockchain is proposed to ensure secure miner selection. This scheme
evaluates candidates' reputation by using both historical interactions and
recommended opinions from other vehicles. The candidates with high reputation
are selected to be active miners and standby miners. In the second stage, to
prevent internal collusion among the active miners, a newly generated block is
further verified and audited by the standby miners. To incentivize the standby
miners to participate in block verification, we formulate interactions between
the active miners and the standby miners by using contract theory, which takes
block verification security and delay into consideration. Numerical results
based on a real-world dataset indicate that our schemes are secure and
efficient for data sharing in BIoV.

  approach",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the nonlinear optimal control of bypass transition in a boundary
layer flow subjected to a pair of free stream vortical perturbations using a
receding horizon approach. The optimal control problem is solved using the
Lagrange variational technique that results in a set of adjoint equations, used
to obtain the optimal wall actuation (blowing and suction from a control slot
located in the transition region). The receding horizon approach enables the
application of control action over a longer time period, and allows the
extraction of time-averaged statistics as well as investigation of the control
effect downstream of the control slot. The results show that the controlled
flow energy is initially reduced in the streamwise direction and then increased
because transition still occurs. The distribution of the optimal control
velocity responds to the flow activity above and upstream of the control slot.
The control effect propagates downstream of the slot and the flow energy is
reduced up to the exit of the computational domain. The mean drag reduction is
55% and 10% in the control region and downstream of the slot, respectively. The
control mechanism is investigated by examining the second order statistics and
the two-point correlations. It is found that in the upstream (left) side of the
slot, the controller counteracts the near wall high speed streaks and reduces
the turbulent shear stress; this is akin to opposition control in channel flow,
and since the time-average control velocity is positive, it is more similar to
blowing-only opposition control. In the downstream (right) side of the slot,
the controller reacts to the impingement of turbulent spots that have been
produced upstream and inside the boundary layer (top-bottom mechanism). The
control velocity is positive and increases in the streamwise direction, and the
flow behavior is similar to that of uniform blowing.

adjusted factor is even more informative, having a stronger correlation with

these policies, from the first user impressions until the compliance
assessment. We create a diverse corpus of two sets of 6,278 unique
English-language privacy policies from inside and outside the EU, covering
their pre-GDPR and the post-GDPR versions. The results of our tests and
analyses suggest that the GDPR has been a catalyst for a major overhaul of the
privacy policies inside and outside the EU. This overhaul of the policies,
manifesting in extensive textual changes, especially for the EU-based websites,
comes at mixed benefits to the users. While the privacy policies have become
considerably longer, our user study with 470 participants on Amazon MTurk

Using this workflow, we show that privacy policies cover more data practices

also assess how transparent the organizations are with their privacy practices
by performing specificity analysis. In this analysis, we find evidence for
positive changes triggered by the GDPR, with the specificity level improving on
average. Still, we find the landscape of privacy policies to be in a

Despite of
many works devoted to foundations of this law, it is still unclear whether it
is only a statistical regularity, or it has deeper relations with
information-carrying structures of the text. This question relates to that of
distinguishing a meaningful text (written in an unknown system) from a
meaningless set of symbols that mimics statistical features of a text. Here we
contribute to resolving these questions by comparing features of the first half
of a text (from the beginning to the middle) to its second half. This
comparison can uncover hidden effects, because the halves have the same values
of many parameters (style, genre, author's vocabulary {\it etc}). In all
studied texts we saw that for the first half Zipf's law applies from smaller
ranks than in the second half, i.e. the law applies better to the first half.
Also, words that hold Zipf's law in the first half are distributed more
homogeneously over the text. These features do allow to distinguish a
meaningful text from a random sequence of words. Our findings correlate with a
number of textual characteristics that hold in most cases we studied: the first
half is lexically richer, has longer and less repetitive words, more and
shorter sentences, more punctuation signs and more paragraphs. These
differences between the halves indicate on a higher hierarchic level of text
organization that so far went unnoticed in text linguistics. They relate the
validity of Zipf's law to textual information. A complete description of this
effect requires new models, though one existing model can account for some of
its aspects.

previous works where two learners are optimized asynchronously, VCM enables a

probability of an Ising ferromagnet in external magnetic field. Ferromagnetism
accounts for the prior expectation of data smoothness, i.e. a positive
correlation between neighbouring pixels (Ising spins), while the magnetic field
refers to the bias. The restoration is actively supervised by requesting the
true values of certain pixels after a noisy observation. This additional
information improves restoration of other pixels. The optimal strategy of
active inference is not known for realistic (two-dimensional) images. We
determine this strategy for the mean-field version of the model and show that
it amounts to supervising the values of spins (pixels) that do not agree with
the sign of the average magnetization. The strategy leads to a transparent
analytical expression for the minimal Bayesian risk, and shows that there is a
maximal number of pixels beyond of which the supervision is useless. We show
numerically that this strategy applies for two-dimensional images away from the
critical regime. Within this regime the strategy is outperformed by its local
(adaptive) version, which supervises pixels that do not agree with their
Bayesian estimate. We show on transparent examples how active supervising can
be essential in recovering noise-corrupted images and advocate for a wider
usage of active methods in image restoration.

more than 10000 atoms in the moire supercell. Electronic structure, phonon
spectrum, and electron-phonon coupling strength lambda are obtained before and
after atomic-position relaxation both in and out of plane. Obtained lambda is
very large for MA-TBG, with lambda > 1 near the half-filling energies of the
flat bands, while it is small (lambda ~ 0.1) for monolayer and unrotated
bilayer graphene. Significant electron-hole asymmetry occurs in the electronic
structure after atomic-structure relaxation, so lambda is much stronger with
hole doping than electron doping. Obtained electron-phonon coupling is nearly
isotropic and depends very weakly on electronic band and momentum, indicating
that electron-phonon coupling prefers single-gap s-wave superconductivity.
Relevant phonon energies are much larger than electron energy scale, going far
beyond adiabatic limit. Our results provide a fundamental understanding of the
electron-phonon interaction in MA-TBG, highlighting that it can contribute to
rich physics of the system.

Differentiable Gradient Descent (PDGD). PDGD breaks away from the traditional
approach that relies on interleaving or multileaving and extensive sampling of

preferences between document pairs from user clicks and can optimize any
differentiable model. We prove that the gradient of PDGD is unbiased w.r.t.
user document pair preferences. Our experiments on the largest publicly
available Learning to Rank (LTR) datasets show considerable and significant
improvements under all levels of interaction noise. PDGD outperforms existing
OLTR methods both in terms of learning speed as well as final convergence.
Furthermore, unlike previous OLTR methods, PDGD also allows for non-linear
models to be optimized effectively. Our results show that using a neural
network leads to even better performance at convergence than a linear model. In
summary, PDGD is an efficient and unbiased OLTR approach that provides a better

stochastic volatility models. In these models, the stochastic differential
equation for volatility is autonomous, time-homogeneous and dependent on only a
finite number of dimensional parameters. Three bounds on the high-volatility
limits of the drift and diffusion coefficients of volatility ensure that
volatility is mean-reverting, has long memory and is as volatile as the stock
price. Dimensional analysis then provides leading-order approximations to the
drift and diffusion coefficients of volatility for the high-volatility limit.
Thereby, using the Kolmogorov forward equation for the transition probability
of volatility, we find that the tail probability for short-term returns falls
off like an inverse cubic. Our analysis then provides a possible explanation
for the inverse cubic fall off that Gopikrishnan et al. (1998) report for
returns over 5-120 minutes intervals. We find, moreover, that the tail
probability scales like the length of the interval, over which the return is
measured, to the power 3/2. There do not seem to be any empirical results in
the literature with which to compare this last prediction.

induced charge order in cuprate superconductors (Edkins et al.~arXiv:1802.04673
[cond-mat.supr-con]). We argue that it arises from the reorganization of
spin-vortex-induced loop current (SVILC) pattern due to supercurrent-flow
caused by the magnetic field. The reorganization is from the most stable tiling
of $4a times 6a$ spin-vortex quartets ($a$ is the lattice constant in the
CuO$_2$ plane, and a spin-vortex quartet is stable of unit of spin-vortices
that contains four holes, four spin-vortices, and four SVILCs) to that of $4a
times 8a$ spin-vortex quartets. The consequence of this reorganization will
lead to the enhancement of $8a$ charge order, and reduction of $6a$ charge
order. The former is observed in the experiment, but the latter is not
confirmed, so far. However, it may be confirmed if the experimental result is
carefully reexamined.

on the air pressure inside them and attains two distinct geometric forms at

contact on a cylindrical object to pivot it to a vertical pose under the effect

Lifshitz point $\alpha=1/4$. Upon increasing $\alpha$ from zero, the inverse
mass vanishes at $\alpha=1/4$ and it increases monotonically from zero for
$\alpha \geq 1/4$. By deriving an effective low-energy theory of the dilute gas
of fermions, we demonstrate that the Drude weight $K_{\rm th}$ of the thermal
conductivity exhibits a similar dependence on $\alpha$ near the saturation
field. Moreover, this theory predicts a transition between a two-component
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid and a vector-chiral phase at a critical value
$\alpha=\alpha_c$ that agrees very well with previous density matrix
renormalization group results. We also show that the resulting curve $K_{\rm
th}(\alpha)$ is in excellent agreement with exact diagonalization (ED) results.
Our ED results also show that $K_{\rm th}(\alpha)$ has a pronounced minimum at
$\alpha\simeq 0.7$ and it decreases for sufficiently large $\alpha$ at lower
magnetic field values. We also demonstrate that the thermal conductivity is
significantly affected by the presence of magnetothermal coupling.

In particular, we show that each primitive residue class contains infinitely

retrieval primitives. Its applications can be found in various areas, such as
art collections and medical diagnoses. With an increasing prevalence of cloud
computing paradigm, image owners desire to outsource their images to cloud
servers. In order to deal with the risk of privacy leakage of images, images
are typically encrypted before they are outsourced to the cloud, which makes
CBIR an extremely challenging task. Existing studies focus on the scenario with
only a single image owner, leaving the problem of CBIR with multiple image
sources (i.e., owners) unaddressed. In this paper, we propose a secure CBIR
scheme that supports Multiple Image owners with Privacy Protection (MIPP). We
encrypt image features with a secure multi-party computation technique, which
allows image owners to encrypt image features with their own keys. This enables
efficient image retrieval over images gathered from multiple sources, while
guaranteeing that image privacy of an individual image owner will not be leaked
to other image owners. We also propose a new method for similarity measurement
of images that can avoid revealing image similarity information to the cloud.
Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that MIPP achieves
retrieval accuracy and efficiency simultaneously, while preserving image
privacy.

POLarimeter for ICE Samples (POLICES) complementing the measurement facilities

precision Stokes polarimeter to measure the degree of polarization in the
visible light scattered by surfaces at moderate phase angles (from 1.5 to
30{\deg}). We present the photometric and polarimetric phase curves measured on
various surfaces made of pure water ice particles having well-controlled size
and shape (spherical, crushed, frost). The results show how the amplitude and
the shape of the negative polarization branch change with the particles sizes
and the degree of metamorphism of the ice. We found that fresh frost formed by
water condensation on cold surfaces has a phase curve characterized by
resonances (Mie oscillations) indicating that frost embryos are transparent
micrometer-sized particles with a narrow size distribution and spherical shape.
Comparisons of these measurements with polarimetric observations of the icy
satellites of the Solar System suggest that Europa is possibly covered by
relatively coarser (~40-400 {\mu}m) and more sintered grains than Enceladus and
Rhea, more likely covered by frost-like particles of few micrometers in

sintering makes it an ideal tool to detect hints of ongoing processes on icy

emission/absorption associated with both the A and B excitonic resonances.
Based on this evolution, a trion complex related to the B exciton in monolayer

temperatures also disappears from the spectrum as a result of the treatment.
Our observations are attributed to effective passivation of defects on the
MoS$_{2}$ monolayer surface. The passivation reduces the carrier density, which
in turn affects the out-of-plane electric field in the sample. The observed
tuning of the carrier concentration strongly influences also the Raman
scattering in the MoS$_2$ monolayer. An enhancement of Raman scattering at
resonant excitation in the vicinity of the A neutral exciton is clearly seen
for both the out-of-plane A$_1^{'}$ and in-plane E$^{'}$ modes. On the
contrary, when the excitation is in resonance with a corresponding trion, the
Raman scattering features become hardly visible. These results confirm the role
of the excitonic charge state plays in the resonance effect of the excitation

(LFUV). We examine the roles played by LFUV NP and Lepton-Flavour Universal

due to the possibility of allowing at the same time large LFUV and LFU NP
contributions to $C_{10\mu}$, which provides a different mechanism to obey the
constraint from the $B_s \to\mu^+\mu^-$ branching ratio. In this landscape of
NP, we discuss how to discriminate among these scenarios in the short term
thanks to current and forthcoming observables. While the update of $R_K$ will

additional observables, in particular the LFUV angular observable $Q_5$, turn

coefficients are approximately normal and unbiased. This leads to the familiar
frequentist inference in terms of normality-based confidence intervals and
p-values. From a Bayesian perspective, use of the (improper) uniform prior
yields matching results in the sense that posterior quantiles agree with
one-sided confidence bounds. For this, and various other reasons, the uniform
prior is often considered objective or non-informative. In spite of this, we
argue that the uniform prior is not suitable as a default prior for inference
about a regression coefficient in the context of the bio-medical and social
sciences. We propose that a more suitable default choice is the normal
distribution with mean zero and standard deviation equal to the standard error
of the M-estimator. We base this recommendation on two arguments. First, we
show that this prior is non-informative for inference about the sign of the
regression coefficient. Secondly, we show that this prior agrees well with a
meta-analysis of 50 articles from the MEDLINE database.

additional thermodynamic information regarding thermal radiation. The Planck
spectrum for thermal radiation can be derived from purely thermodynamic ideas
applied to the classical simple harmonic oscillator, since every radiation mode
takes a simple oscillator form. Thermodynamics alone implies the Planck

  substantial text overlap with arXiv:1705.05148",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Incorporating full duplex operation in Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO)
systems provides the potential of boosting throughput performance. However, the
hardware complexity of the analog self-interference canceller in emerging full
duplex MIMO designs mostly scales with the number of transmit and receive
antennas, thus exploiting the benefits of analog cancellation becomes
impractical for full duplex MIMO transceivers, even for moderate number of
antennas. In this paper, we present two novel architectures for the analog
canceller comprising of reduced number of cancellation elements, compared to
the state of the art, and simple multiplexers for efficient signal routing
among the transmit and receive radio frequency chains. One architecture is
based on analog taps (tap refers to a line of fixed delay, variable phase
shifter, and attenuator) and the other on AUXiliary (AUX) Transmitters (TXs)
that locally generate the cancellation signal. In contrast to the available
analog cancellation architectures, the values for each tap or each AUX TX and
the configuration of the multiplexers are jointly designed with the digital
transmit and receive beamforming filters according to certain performance
objectives. Focusing on a narrowband flat fading channel model as an example,
we present a general optimization framework for the joint design of analog
self-interference cancellation and digital beamforming. We also detail the sum
rate optimization objective together with its derived solution for the latter
architectural components. Representative computer simulation results
demonstrate the superiority both in terms of hardware complexity and achievable
performance of the proposed low complexity full duplex MIMO schemes over the
lately available ones.

H, measures a typically social feature, inequality or diversity in the
distribution of available resources. A symmetry phase transition takes place at
Gini values 1/3, where realistic distributions become asymmetric. Four
constraints act on S: expectedly, N and W, and new ones, diversity and
interactions between individuals; the latter result from the two coordinates of
a single point in the data, the peak. The occupation number of a job is either
zero or one, suggesting Fermi-Dirac statistics for employment. Contrariwise, an
indefinite nujmber of individuals can occupy a state defined as a quantile of
income or of age, so Bose-Einstein statistics may be required.
Indistinguishability rather than anonymity of individuals and resources is thus
needed. Interactions between individuals define define classes of equivalence
that happen to coincide with acceptable definitions of social classes or
periods in human life. The entropy S is non-extensive and obtainable from data.
Theoretical laws are compared to data in four different cases of economical or
physiological diversity. Acceptable fits are found for all of them.

are two promising approaches to support massive content delivery over wireless

characterize the fact that devices are usually grouped into clusters. Motivated
by this fact, this paper presents a comprehensive performance analysis and
joint communication and caching optimization for a clustered D2D network.
Devices are distributed according to a Thomas cluster process (TCP) and are
assumed to have a surplus memory which is exploited to proactively cache files
from a known library, following a random probabilistic caching scheme. Devices
can retrieve the requested files from their caches, from neighbouring devices
in their proximity (cluster), or from the base station as a last resort. Three
key performance metrics are optimized in this paper, namely, the offloading

networks (DNNs) to predict the ultimate bearing capacity of shallow foundation
in situations when the experimental data which may be used to train networks is
scarce. Two experiments involving testing over 17000 networks were conducted.
The first experiment was aimed at comparing the accuracy of shallow neural
networks and DNNs predictions. It shows that when the experimental dataset used
for preparing models is small then DNNs have a significant advantage over
shallow networks. The second experiment was conducted to compare the
performance of DNNs consisting of different number of neurons and layers.
Obtained results indicate that the optimal number of layers varies between 5 to
7. Networks with less and - surprisingly - more layers obtain lower accuracy.
Moreover, the number of neurons in DNN has a lower impact on the prediction
accuracy than the number of DNN's layers. DNNs perform very well, even when
trained with only 6 samples. Basing on the results it seems that when
predicting the ultimate bearing capacity with ANN models obtaining small but
high-quality experimental training datasets instead of large training datasets
affected by a higher error is an advisable approach.
