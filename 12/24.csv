regularization method, called {\it Fractional Asymptotical Regularization
(FAR)}, for solving linear ill-posed operator equations in a Hilbert space
setting. We assign the method to the general linear regularization schema and
prove that under certain smoothness assumptions, FAR with fractional order in
the range $(1,2)$ yields an acceleration with respect to comparable order
optimal regularization methods. Based on the one-step Adams-Moulton method, a
novel iterative regularization scheme is developed for the numerical
realization of FAR. Two numerical examples are given to show the accuracy and
the acceleration effect of FAR.

problem. The minimum cost multicut problem is first converted to an
unconstrained binary cubic formulation where cycle consistency constraints are
incorporated into the objective function. The new optimization problem can be
viewed as a Conditional Random Field (CRF) in which the random variables are
associated with the binary edge labels of the initial graph and the hard
constraints are introduced in the CRF as high-order potentials. The parameters
of a standard Neural Network and the fully differentiable CRF are optimized in
an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, our method utilizes the cycle constraints as
meta-supervisory signals during the learning of the deep feature
representations by taking the dependencies between the output random variables
into account. We present analyses of the end-to-end learned representations,
showing the impact of the joint training, on the task of clustering images of

horizontal spacing (0<=(S/D)<=10) on both momentum and heat transfer
characteristics has been delineated under the following pertinent parameters:
Grashof number (10<=Gr<=1e3), Prandtl number (0.71<=n<=100), and Power-law
index (0.4<=n<=1.6). The heat transfer characteristics are elucidated in terms
of isotherms, local Nusselt number (Nu) distributions and average Nusselt
number values, whereas the flow characteristics are interpreted in terms of
streamlines, pressure contours, local distribution of the pressure drag and
skin-friction drag coefficients along with the total drag coefficient values.
The average Nusselt number shows a positive dependence on both Gr and Pr
whereas it shows an adverse dependence on Power-law index (n). Overall,
shear-thinning (n<1) fluid behavior promotes the convection whereas
shear-thickening (n>1) behavior impedes it with reference to a Newtonian fluid
(n=1). Furthermore, owing to the formation of a chimney effect, the heat
transfer increases with decrease in horizontal spacing (S/D) and reaches a
maximum value corresponding to the optimal spacing whereas the heat transfer
drops significantly with further decrease in S/D. Finally, a correlation for Nu
has been developed, which can be useful to academic researchers and practicing
engineers.

Engineering research, for example, to predict defects in source code. In our
research in this area, with data from open source projects as well as an
industrial partner, we noticed several shortcomings of conventional data mining
approaches for classification problems: (1) Domain experts' acceptance is of
critical importance, and domain experts can provide valuable input, but it is
hard to use this feedback. (2) The evaluation of the model is not a simple
matter of calculating AUC or accuracy. Instead, there are multiple objectives
of varying importance, but their importance cannot be easily quantified.
Furthermore, the performance of the model cannot be evaluated on a per-instance
level in our case, because it shares aspects with the set cover problem. To
overcome these problems, we take a holistic approach and develop a rule mining
system that simplifies iterative feedback from domain experts and can easily
incorporate the domain-specific evaluation needs. A central part of the system
is a novel multi-objective anytime rule mining algorithm. The algorithm is
based on the GRASP-PR meta-heuristic but extends it with ideas from several
other approaches. We successfully applied the system in the industrial context.
In the current article, we focus on the description of the algorithm and the

of publicly available data from the World Bank spanning several decades for
~195 countries show that across and within nations over time, per capita Gross
Domestic Product (GDP), energy use, and CO2 emissions are lowest in
predominantly rural countries (rural > urban pop.), increase rapidly across
urbanizing countries (rural urban pop.) and are highest in the most urban
countries (rural < urban pop.). These trends coincide with changes in
employment by sector and gender. Rural economies are based largely on
employment in the resource-extraction sector, which includes agriculture,
fisheries, forestry, and mining. In urbanizing nations, male employment is
predominantly in the industrial sector, including public utilities, while
female employment is higher in service-based than resource-based economies. In
the most urban nations, service economies predominate with some countries
employing 90% of women and 65% of men in the service sector. Our analysis shows
that per capita GDP, energy use, and CO2 emissions increase by over two orders
of magnitude from low-income, resource-based rural countries to high-income,
urbanized countries with predominantly service economies. Data from the U.S.
over the past 200 years illuminate a socio-metabolic urban transition similar
to that seen globally in recent decades across countries and through time. Our
study suggests that increased energy demand and climate consequences of burning
fossil fuels will continue to accompany a rapidly urbanizing planet posing
major challenges for global sustainability.

painted by the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm have led to considerations of modified
dark matter models. One such dark matter model that has recently attracted much
attention is fuzzy dark matter (FDM). In FDM models, the dark matter is
envisaged to be an ultra-light scalar field with a particle mass $m_{\rm FDM}
\sim 10^{-22} $ eV. This yields astronomically large de Broglie wavelengths
which can suppress small-scale structure formation and give rise to the
observed kpc-sized density cores in dwarf galaxies. We investigate the
evolution of the 21-cm signal during Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization
(EoR) in $\Lambda$FDM cosmologies using analytical models. The delay in source
formation and the absence of small halos in $\Lambda$FDM significantly postpone
the Ly$\alpha$ coupling, heating, as well as the reionization of the neutral
hydrogen of the intergalactic medium. As a result, the absorption feature in
the evolution of the global 21-cm signal has a significantly smaller full width
at half maximum ($\Delta z \lesssim 3$), than $\Lambda$CDM ($\Delta z \simeq
6$). This alone rules out $m_{\rm FDM} < 6 \times 10^{-22}$ eV as a result of
the $2\sigma$ lower limit $\Delta z \gtrsim 4$ from EDGES High-Band. As a
result, $\Lambda$FDM is not a viable solution to the potential small-scale
problems facing $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, we show that any detection of the 21-cm

the more challenging QUIC protocol, our approach yields 98% accuracy. To show

study three different sampling techniques and demonstrate that sampling packets
from an arbitrary portion of a flow is sufficient for classification.

Two popular approaches are principal component analysis, which projects onto a
small number of well chosen but non-interpretable directions, and feature
selection, which selects a small number of the original features. Feature
selection can be abstracted as a numerical linear algebra problem called the
column subset selection problem (CSSP). CSSP corresponds to selecting the best
subset of columns of a matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d}$, where
\emph{best} is often meant in the sense of minimizing the approximation error,
i.e., the norm of the residual after projection of $X$ onto the space spanned
by the selected columns. Such an optimization over subsets of $\{1,\dots,d\}$
is usually impractical. One workaround that has been vastly explored is to
resort to polynomial-cost, random subset selection algorithms that favor small
values of this approximation error. We propose such a randomized algorithm,
based on sampling from a projection determinantal point process (DPP), a
repulsive distribution over a fixed number $k$ of indices $\{1,\dots,d\}$ that
favors diversity among the selected columns. We give bounds on the ratio of the
expected approximation error for this DPP over the optimal error of PCA. These
bounds improve over the state-of-the-art bounds of \emph{volume sampling} when
some realistic structural assumptions are satisfied for $X$. Numerical
experiments suggest that our bounds are tight, and that our algorithms have
comparable performance with the \emph{double phase} algorithm, often considered
to be the practical state-of-the-art. Column subset selection with DPPs thus
inherits the best of both worlds: good empirical performance and tight error
bounds.

distribution of the crater-forming projectiles, we calculate the number of
craters per unit area formed as a function of the time a surface on 2014 MU69

distribution from 1-15 km exhibited on Pluto and Charon is indeed due to the
sizes of Kuiper Belt projectiles, 2014 MU69 should exhibit a surface that is
only lightly cratered below 1 km scale, despite being bombarded for
$\sim4$~billion years. Its surface should therefore be more clearly indicative
of its accretionary environment. In addition, this object may the first
observed for which the majority of the bombardment is from exogenic projectiles
moving less than or near the speed of sound in the target materials, implying
morphologies more akin to secondary craters elsewhere in the Solar System.
Lastly, if the shallow Kuiper Belt size distribution implied from the Pluto and
Charon imaging is confirmed at MU69, then we conclude that this size
distribution is a preserved relic of its state $\simeq$4.5~Gyr ago and provides
a direct constraint on the planetesimal formation process itself.

corona, some instances of the solar wind, the aurora, inner regions of
accretion discs, their coronae, and some laboratory plasmas, Alfv\'enic
fluctuations produce no ion heating within the gyrokinetic approximation, i.e.,
as long as their amplitudes (at the Larmor scale) are small and their
frequencies stay below the ion Larmor frequency (even as their spatial scales
can be above or below the ion Larmor scale). Thus, all low-frequency ion
heating in such plasmas is due to compressive fluctuations (""slow modes"").
Because these fluctuations energetically decouple from the Alfv\'enic ones
already in the inertial range, the above conclusion means that the energy
partition between ions and electrons in low-beta plasmas is decided at the
outer scale, where turbulence is launched, and can be determined from
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models of the relevant astrophysical systems. Any
additional ion heating must come from non-gyrokinetic mechanisms such as
cyclotron heating or the stochastic heating owing to distortions of ions'
Larmor orbits. An exception to these conclusions occurs in the Hall limit,
i.e., when the ratio of the ion to electron temperatures is as low as the ion
beta (equivalently, the electron beta is order unity). In this regime, slow
modes couple to Alfv\'enic ones well above the Larmor scale (viz., at the ion
inertial or ion sound scale), so the Alfv\'enic and compressive cascades join
and then separate again into two cascades of fluctuations that linearly
resemble kinetic Alfv\'en and ion cyclotron waves, with the former heating
electrons and the latter ions. The two cascades are shown to decouple, scalings
for them are derived, and it is argued physically that the two species will be

conformal symmetry and integrability. Based on this relation, we obtain the
hexagon form factors for a large class of states, including the BMN vacuum,
some excited states, and the Lagrangian density. We apply these form factors to
the computation of several correlators and match the results with direct
Feynman diagrammatic calculations. We also study the renormalisation of the
hexagon form factor expansion for a family of diagonal structure constants and
test the procedure at higher orders through comparison with a known universal

populations, few laboratory systems exist to systematically investigate the
impact of advection on their spatial evolutionary dynamics. To address this
problem, we study the morphology and genetic spatial structure of microbial
colonies growing on the surface of a nutrient-laden fluid $10^4$ to $10^5$
times more viscous than water in Petri dishes, the extreme but finite viscosity
inhibits undesired thermal convection and allows populations to effectively
live at the air-liquid interface due to capillary forces. We discover that S.
cerevisiae (baker's yeast) growing on a viscous liquid behave like ""active
matter"": they metabolically generate fluid flows many times larger than their
unperturbed colony expansion speed, and that flow, in return, can dramatically
impact their colony morphology and spatial population genetics. We show that
yeast cells generate fluid flows by consuming surrounding nutrients and
decreasing the local substrate density, leading to misaligned fluid pressure
and density contours, which ultimately generates vorticity via a thresholdless
baroclinic instability. Numerical simulations demonstrate that an intense
vortex ring is produced below the colony's edge and quantitatively predict the
observed flow. As the viscosity of the substrate is lowered and the
self-induced flow intensifies, we observe three distinct morphologies: at the
highest viscosity,compact circular colonies similar to those grown on hard agar
plates except with a stretched regime of exponential expansion, intermediate
viscosities give rise to compact colonies with ""fingers"" that are ripped away
to break into smaller cell clusters, and at the lowest viscosity, the expanding
colony breaks up into many genetically-diverse, mutually repelling, island-like
fragments of yeast colonies.

build a `contagion map' for a contagion spreading on such a `noisy geometric
network' to produce a point cloud; and we study the dimensionality, geometry,
and topology of this point cloud to examine qualitative properties of this
spreading process. We identify a region in parameter space in which the
contagion propagates predominantly via wavefront propagation. We consider
different probability distributions for constructing nongeometric edges --
reflecting different decay rates with respect to the distance between nodes in
the underlying manifold -- and examine the effect of such choices on the
qualitative properties of the spreading dynamics. Our work generalizes the
analysis in Taylor et al. and consolidates contagion maps both as a tool for
investigating spreading behavior on spatial networks and as a technique for
manifold learning.

formulated as a two-player zero-sum dynamic game problem, where the action
space of the adversarial player is a Wasserstein ball centered at the empirical

the corresponding multi-stage guarantee without any degradation in the

  Text Recognition",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, the hybrid convolutional neural network hidden Markov model
(CNN-HMM) has been introduced for offline handwritten Chinese text recognition
(HCTR) and has achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, modeling each of
the large vocabulary of Chinese characters with a uniform and fixed number of
hidden states requires high memory and computational costs and makes the tens
of thousands of HMM state classes confusing. Another key issue of CNN-HMM for
HCTR is the diversified writing style, which leads to model strain and a
significant performance decline for specific writers. To address these issues,
we propose a writer-aware CNN based on parsimonious HMM (WCNN-PHMM). First,
PHMM is designed using a data-driven state-tying algorithm to greatly reduce
the total number of HMM states, which not only yields a compact CNN by state
sharing of the same or similar radicals among different Chinese characters but
also improves the recognition accuracy due to the more accurate modeling of
tied states and the lower confusion among them. Second, WCNN integrates each
convolutional layer with one adaptive layer fed by a writer-dependent vector,
namely, the writer code, to extract the irrelevant variability in writer
information to improve recognition performance. The parameters of
writer-adaptive layers are jointly optimized with other network parameters in
the training stage, while a multiple-pass decoding strategy is adopted to learn
the writer code and generate recognition results. Validated on the ICDAR 2013
competition of CASIA-HWDB database, the more compact WCNN-PHMM of a 7360-class
vocabulary can achieve a relative character error rate (CER) reduction of 16.6%
over the conventional CNN-HMM without considering language modeling. By
adopting a powerful hybrid language model (N-gram language model and recurrent
neural network language model), the CER of WCNN-PHMM is reduced to 3.17%.

can enhance quantum key distribution (QKD). Each network we examine is an
n-photon quantum state with a degree of entanglement. We analyze such a state
within the space of measured data from repeated experiments made by n observers
over a set of identically-prepared quantum states -- a quantum state
interrogation in the space of measurements. Each observer records a 1 if their
detector triggers, otherwise they record a 0. This generates a string of 1's
and 0's at each detector, and each observer can define a binary random variable
from this sequence. We use a well-known information geometry-based measure of
distance that applies to these binary strings of measurement outcomes, and we
introduce a generalization of this length to area, volume and
higher-dimensional volumes. These geometric equations are defined using the
familiar Shannon expression for joint and mutual entropy. We apply our approach
to three distinct tripartite quantum states: the GHZ state, the W state, and a
separable state P. We generalize a well-known information geometry analysis of
a bipartite state to a tripartite state. This approach provides a novel way to
characterize quantum states, and it may have favorable scaling with increased

the nuclear abundances to compute nuclear weak interaction rates. To quantify
the impact of a consistent treatment of nuclear abundances on CCSN dynamics, we
carry out spherically symmetric CCSN simulations with full Boltzmann neutrino
transport, systematically changing the treatment of weak interactions, EOSs,

abundances between the EOS and weak interaction rates weakens the EOS
dependence of both the dynamics and neutrino signals. We also test the validity
of two artificial prescriptions for weak interactions of light nuclei and find
that both prescriptions affect the dynamics. Furthermore, there are differences
in neutrino luminosities by ~10% and in average neutrino energies by 0.25-1 MeV

Therefore, information about PMFs should be included in the temperature
anisotropy of the Cosmic Microwave Background through the thermal

been known for decades that capillary flows offer an ideal method of fuel
management, there has been little research devoted to the general stability
properties of such flows. In this work, we demonstrate theoretically why
capillary flows which channel wetting liquids in slender open triangular
channels tend to be very stable against disturbances. By utilizing the gradient
flow form of the governing fluid interface equation, we first prove that
stationary interfaces in the presence of steady flow are asymptotically
nonlinearly and exponentially stable in the Lyapunov sense. We then demonstrate
that fluid interfaces exhibiting self-similar Washburn dynamics are transiently
and asymptotically linearly stable to small perturbations. This second finding
relies on a generalized non-modal stability analysis due to the non-normality
of the governing disturbance operator. Taken together, these findings reveal
the robust nature of transient and steady capillary flows in open grooved

local sector symmetries, rather than from the global crystal asymmetry alone

$s_i$ that occurs at least $\phi N$ times in $S$. The problem of finding
heavy-hitters has been extensively studied in the database literature. In this
paper, we study a related problem. We say that there is a $\phi$-event at time
$t$ if $s_t$ occurs exactly $\phi N$ times in $(s_1, s_2, ..., s_t)$. Thus, for
each $\phi$-heavy hitter there is a single $\phi$-event which occurs when its
count reaches the reporting threshold $\phi N$. We define the online
event-detection problem (OEDP) as: given $\phi$ and a stream $S$, report all
$\phi$-events as soon as they occur.
  Many real-world monitoring systems demand event detection where all events
must be reported (no false negatives), in a timely manner, with no non-events
reported (no false positives), and a low reporting threshold. As a result, the
OEDP requires a large amount of space (Omega(N) words) and is not solvable in
the streaming model or via standard sampling-based approaches.
  Since OEDP requires large space, we focus on cache-efficient algorithms in
the external-memory model.
  We provide algorithms for the OEDP that are within a log factor of optimal.
Our algorithms are tunable: its parameters can be set to allow for a bounded

observed the object four times from November 2016 to May 2017 with Swift and
XMM-Newton, and carried out a precise X-ray spectral study for the first time.
There were hardly any changes of the fluxes and spectral shapes for half a
year, and the absorption-corrected luminosity was 3.0e+33 erg/s in the 0.5 -
10.0 keV range at a distance of 4.1 kpc. The hydrogen column density was higher
than that expected from the interstellar absorption, thus the X-ray spectra
were probably absorbed by the WR wind. The energy spectrum was successfully
modeled by a collisional equilibrium plasma emission, where both the plasma and
the absorbing wind have unusual elemental abundances particular to the WR
stars. In 1981, the Einstein satellite clearly detected X-rays from WR 125,
whereas the ROSAT satellite hardly detected X-rays in 1991, when the binary was
probably around the periastron passage. We discuss possible causes for the
unexpectedly low soft X-ray flux near the periastron.

polarization may appear, both T-even and T-odd. $\nu_e$s are produced by the
low energy monochromatic (un)polarized emitter located at a near distance from
the hypothetical detector which is able to measure both the azimuthal angle and
polar angle of the recoil electrons, and/or also the energy of the outgoing
electrons with a high resolution. A detection process is the elastic scattering
of $\nu_e$s (Dirac or Majorana) on the polarized electrons. Left chiral (LC)
$\nu_e$s interact mainly by the standard $V - A$ interaction, while right
chiral (RC) ones participate only in the non-standard $V + A$, scalar $S_R$,
pseudoscalar $P_R$ and tensor $T_R$ interactions. All the interactions are of
flavour-conserving type (FC). We show that a distinction between the Dirac and
the Majorana $\nu_e$ s is possible both for the longitudinal and the
transversal $\nu_e$ polarizations. In the first case a departure from the
standard prediction of the azimuthal asymmetry of recoil electrons is caused by
the interferences between the non-standard complex S and T couplings. Such a
deviation would indicate the Dirac $\nu_e$ nature and the presence of time
reversal symmetry violation (TRSV) interactions. In the second case the
azimuthal asymmetries, polar distribution and energy spectrum of scattered
electrons are sensitive to the interference terms between the standard and
exotic interactions, proportional to the various angular correlations. Our
model-independent study is carried out for the flavour $\nu_e$ eigenstates in

lifting of the Raman-active E' phonon degeneracy. While ferromagnetism is
observed under compression along x-axis and expansion along y-axis, no magnetic
order occurs when interchanging the strain direction. The calculations show
that the magnetic behavior of the system depends on the exchange within the 5d
orbitals of the Ta atoms. The magnetic moment per Ta atom persists even when an
additional compressive strain along the z-axis is added to a biaxially-strained

This has motivated the development of 3D CNNs for volumetric image segmentation
in order to benefit from more spatial context. Due to GPU memory restrictions
caused by moving to fully 3D, state-of-the-art methods depend on
subvolume/patch processing and the size of the input patch is usually small,
limiting the incorporation of larger context information for a better

Convolution (HDC), for an effective and efficient semantic segmentation of
volumetric images. HDC consists of a periodic down-shuffling operation followed
by a conventional 3D convolution. HDC has the advantage of significantly
reducing the size of the data for sub-sequential processing while using all the

reflective of the intrinsic stiffness of the saccharide rings and the dynamical

unit cell (u.c.) is investigated via the resonant inelastic x-ray scattering
(RIXS) technique at the O K-edge to unravel the intriguing interplay of orbital
and charge degrees of freedom. We found that orbital-selective quantum
confinement effect (QCE) induces the splitting of Ru $4d$ orbitals. At the same
time, we observed a clear suppression of the electron-hole continuum across the
metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) occurring at the 4 u.c. sample. From these
two clear observations we conclude that QCE gives rise to a Mott insulating
phase in ultrathin SrRuO$_3$ films. Our interpretation of the RIXS spectra is
supported by the configuration interaction calculations of RuO$_6$ clusters.

exploration in indoor environments. Specially, we present a hybrid map, named
Semantic Road Map (SRM), to represent the topological structure of the explored
environment and facilitate decision-making in the exploration. The SRM is built
incrementally along with the exploration process. It is a graph structure with
collision-free nodes and edges that are generated within the sensor coverage.
Moreover, each node has a semantic label and the expected information gain at
that location. Based on the concise SRM, we present a novel and effective
decision-making model to determine the next-best-target (NBT) during the
exploration. The model concerns the semantic information, the information gain,
and the path cost to the target location. We use the nodes of SRM to represent
the candidate targets, which enables the target evaluation to be performed
directly on the SRM. With the SRM, both the information gain of a node and the
path cost to the node can be obtained efficiently. Besides, we adopt the
cross-entropy method to optimize the path to make it more informative. We
conduct experimental studies in both simulated and real-world environments,
which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

solar flare SOL2014-03-29T17:48. The observations in X-ray, microwave, and
extreme ultraviolet (EUV) bands are exploited to study the fine temporal,
spatial, and spectral structures of the flare. The periods, amplitudes, and
phases of both the fluxes and physical parameters (emission measure,
temperature) are studied using standard methods of correlation, Fourier, and
wavelet analyses. It is found that the source of the QPPs is associated with
the uniform post-flare loop. The X-ray source is located at the top of the
arcade. QPPs with the similar characteristic time scales of $P\approx$ 74--80 s
are found in the X-ray (3--25 keV) and microwave (15.7 GHz) emissions. Besides,
QPPs with the same period are found in the time profiles of both the
temperature ($T_e$) and emission measure ($EM$). The QPPs in temperature and
the QPPs in emission measure demonstrate anti-phase behavior. The analysis
reveals the quasi-periodic process of energy relaxation, without any additional

isotope measurements in terrestrial and lunar rocks that reveal an enrichment
in the lighter isotopes of Cr in the Moon compared to Earths mantle by 100 +/-
40 ppm per atomic mass unit. This observation is consistent with Cr
partitioning into an oxygen-rich vapour phase in equilibrium with the

fugacities near the Fayalite-Magnetite-Quartz buffer are required to explain

singular control, in which each player faces a minimization problem of
monotone-follower type with submodular costs. We call these games
""monotone-follower games"". In a not necessarily Markovian setting, we establish
the existence of Nash equilibria. Moreover, we introduce a sequence of
approximating games by restricting, for each natural number n, the players'
admissible strategies to the set of Lipschitz processes with Lipschitz constant
bounded by n. We prove that, for each n, there exists a Nash equilibrium of the
approximating game and that the sequence of Nash equilibria converges, in the
Meyer-Zheng sense, to a weak (distributional) Nash equilibrium of the original
game of singular control. As a byproduct, such a convergence also provides
approximation results of the equilibrium values across the two classes of
games. We finally show how our findings can be employed to prove existence of
open-loop Nash equilibria in an N-player stochastic differential game with
singular controls, and we propose an algorithm to determine a Nash equilibrium
for the monotone-follower game.

Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
They are produced in all stages of the collision and are not affected by
final-state interactions. Thus, they provide a penetrating probe of the created
medium. In the dielectron intermediate-mass region a measurement of the thermal
radiation from the QGP gives information on the medium temperature. However, in
this region the main component of the dielectron continuum stems from
correlated semi-leptonic decays of charm and beauty hadrons. Therefore, it is
crucial to understand the heavy-flavour (HF) production in vacuum and to find a
way to separate this contribution from the thermal dielectron signal of the
QGP. In this paper we will present the production of correlated $\rm e^+e^-$
pairs in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV with the expectations from known
hadronic sources as a function of $m_{\rm ee}$, $p_{\rm T,ee}$, and the pair
distance of closest approach to the primary vertex $\rm DCA_{ee}$. The
extraction of the ratio of inclusive photons to decay photons and the charm and
beauty cross sections from a fit of the data with different Monte-Carlo

heavy-flavour production. In particular, we demonstrate how the $\rm DCA_{ee}$

thus help to disentangle the contribution of thermal radiation from the

different contexts. Linear constraints appear e.g. in physical systems, when
additional information about the system is available through higher moments.
Escort distributions appear naturally in the context of multifractals and
information geometry. It was shown recently that there exists a fundamental
duality that relates both approaches on the basis of the corresponding deformed
logarithms (deformed-log duality). Here we show that there exists another
duality that arises in the context of information geometry, relating the Fisher
information of $\phi$-deformed exponential families that correspond to linear
constraints (as studied by J. Naudts), with those that are based on escort
constraints (as studied by S.-I. Amari). We explicitly demonstrate this
information geometric duality for the case of $(c,d)$-entropy that covers all
situations that are compatible with the first three Shannon-Khinchin axioms,

As the option to modify a potential cause is not given in many situations only
structural properties of the data can be used to solve this ill-posed problem.
We briefly review a number of state-of-the-art methods for this, including very
recent ones. A novel inference method is introduced, Bayesian Causal Inference
(BCI), which assumes a generative Bayesian hierarchical model to pursue the
strategy of Bayesian model selection. In the adopted model the distribution of
the cause variable is given by a Poisson lognormal distribution, which allows
to explicitly regard the discrete nature of datasets, correlations in the
parameter spaces, as well as the variance of probability densities on
logarithmic scales. We assume Fourier diagonal Field covariance operators. The
model itself is restricted to use cases where a direct causal relation $X
\rightarrow Y$ has to be decided against a relation $Y \rightarrow X$ ,
therefore we compare it other methods for this exact problem setting. The
generative model assumed provides synthetic causal data for benchmarking our
model in comparison to existing State-of-the-art models, namely LiNGAM ,
ANM-HSIC , ANM-MML , IGCI and CGNN . We explore how well the above methods

To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end trainable network architecture,

learn multi-scale image features as a backbone network, sharing fully

text detection branch, we directly generate text proposals in quadrangles,
covering oriented, perspective and curved text regions. To preserve text

RoI features by RNN into context information, combining spatial attention
mechanism to generate text sequences. This overall pipeline is capable of
handling both regular and irregular cases. Finally, text localization and
recognition tasks can be jointly trained in an end-to-end fashion with designed

where some classes have samples and others are learned from side information,
like semantic attributes or text description, in a zero-shot learning fashion
(ZSL). Training a single model that operates in these two regimes
simultaneously is challenging. Here we describe a probabilistic approach that
breaks the model into three modular components, and then combines them in a
consistent way. Specifically, our model consists of three classifiers: A
""gating"" model that makes soft decisions if a sample is from a ""seen"" class,
and two experts: a ZSL expert, and an expert model for seen classes.
  We address two main difficulties in this approach: How to provide an accurate
estimate of the gating probability without any training samples for unseen
classes; and how to use expert predictions when it observes samples outside of
its domain. The key insight to our approach is to pass information between the
three models to improve each one's accuracy, while maintaining the modular
structure. We test our approach, adaptive confidence smoothing (COSMO), on four
standard GZSL benchmark datasets and find that it largely outperforms
state-of-the-art GZSL models. COSMO is also the first model that closes the gap
and surpasses the performance of generative models for GZSL, even-though it is
a light-weight model that is much easier to train and tune.

COSMO's modular structure, instead of trying to perform well both on seen and
on unseen classes, models can focus on accurate classification of unseen
classes, and later consider seen class models.

  stochastic volatility model","38 pages",,,,"q-fin.CP math.AP math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a general, very fast method to quickly approximate the solution of
a parabolic Partial Differential Equation (PDEs) with explicit formulas. Our
method also provides equaly fast approximations of the derivatives of the
solution, which is a challenge for many other methods. Our approach is based on
a computable series expansion in terms of a ""small"" parameter. As an example,
we treat in detail the important case of the SABR PDE for $\beta = 1$, namely
$\partial_{\tau}u = \sigma^2 \big [ \frac{1}{2} (\partial^2_xu - \partial_xu) +
\nu \rho \partial_x\partial_\sigma u + \frac{1}{2} \nu^2 \partial^2_\sigma u \,
\big ] + \kappa (\theta - \sigma) \partial_\sigma$, by choosing $\nu$ as small
parameter. This yields $u = u_0 + \nu u_1 + \nu^2 u_2 + \ldots$, with $u_j$
independent of $\nu$. The terms $u_j$ are explicitly computable, which is also
a challenge for many other, related methods. Truncating this expansion leads to
computable approximations of $u$ that are in ""closed form,"" and hence can be
evaluated very quickly. Most of the other related methods use the ""time"" $\tau$
as a small parameter. The advantage of our method is that it leads to shorter
and hence easier to determine and to generalize formulas. We obtain also an
explicit expansion for the implied volatility in the SABR model in terms of
$\nu$, similar to Hagan's formula, but including also the {\em mean reverting
term.} We provide several numerical tests that show the performance of our
method. In particular, we compare our formula to the one due to Hagan. Our
results also behave well when used for actual market data and show the mean
reverting property of the volatility.

PatientEG dataset with 191,294 events, 3,429 distinct entities, and 545,993

we link them with the Chinese biomedical knowledge graph. With the help of

resulting release of gravitational energy leads to emission of X-rays. The
radiation is affected by special/general relativistic effects, and can serve as
a probe of the properties of the black hole and surrounding environment, if the
accretion geometry is properly identified. Two competing models describe the
disk-corona geometry for the hard spectral state of BHBs, based on spectral and
timing measurements. Measuring the polarization of hard X-rays reflected from
the disk allows the geometry to be determined. The extent of the corona differs
between the two models, affecting the strength of relativistic effects (e.g.,
enhancement of polarization fraction and rotation of polarization angle). Here,
we report observational results on linear polarization of hard X-ray (19-181
keV) emission from a BHB, Cygnus X-1, in the hard state. The low polarization
fraction, <8.6% (upper limit at 90% confidence level), and the alignment of the
polarization angle with the jet axis show that the dominant emission is not
influenced by strong gravity. When considered together with existing spectral

multiple class labels. This is in contrast to the traditional classification
problem where every data instance has a single label. Due to the exponential
size of output space, exploiting intrinsic information in feature and label
spaces has been the major thrust of research in recent years and use of
parametrization and embedding have been the prime focus. Researchers have
studied several aspects of embedding which include label embedding, input
embedding, dimensionality reduction and feature selection. These approaches
differ from one another in their capability to capture other intrinsic
properties such as label correlation, local invariance etc. We assume here that
the input data form groups and as a result, the label matrix exhibits a
sparsity pattern and hence the labels corresponding to objects in the same
group have similar sparsity. In this paper, we study the embedding of labels
together with the group information with an objective to build an efficient
multi-label classification. We assume the existence of a low-dimensional space
onto which the feature vectors and label vectors can be embedded. In order to
achieve this, we address three sub-problems namely; (1) Identification of
groups of labels; (2) Embedding of label vectors to a low rank-space so that
the sparsity characteristic of individual groups remains invariant; and (3)
Determining a linear mapping that embeds the feature vectors onto the same set
of points, as in stage 2, in the low-dimensional space. We compare our method
with seven well-known algorithms on twelve benchmark data sets. Our
experimental analysis manifests the superiority of our proposed method over
state-of-art algorithms for multi-label learning.

on a given exemplar without the paired data, has accomplished substantial
advancements. In order to transfer the information from an exemplar to an input
image, existing methods often use a normalization technique, e.g., adaptive
instance normalization, that controls the channel-wise statistics of an input
activation map at a particular layer, such as the mean and the variance.
Meanwhile, style transfer approaches similar task to image translation by
nature, demonstrated superior performance by using the higher-order statistics
such as covariance among channels in representing a style. In detail, it works
via whitening (given a zero-mean input feature, transforming its covariance
matrix into the identity). followed by coloring (changing the covariance matrix
of the whitened feature to those of the style feature). However, applying this
approach in image translation is computationally intensive and error-prone due
to the expensive time complexity and its non-trivial backpropagation. In
response, this paper proposes an end-to-end approach tailored for image
translation that efficiently approximates this transformation with our novel
regularization methods. We further extend our approach to a group-wise form for
memory and time efficiency as well as image quality. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrate that our proposed method is fast, both in
training and inference, and highly effective in reflecting the style of an
exemplar. Finally, our code is available at

contributions. First, we argue that the existing MMD loss function may
discourage the learning of fine details in data as it attempts to contract the

repulsive loss function to actively learn the difference among the real data by
simply rearranging the terms in MMD. Second, inspired by the hinge loss, we
propose a bounded Gaussian kernel to stabilize the training of MMD-GAN with the
repulsive loss function. The proposed methods are applied to the unsupervised
image generation tasks on CIFAR-10, STL-10, CelebA, and LSUN bedroom datasets.
Results show that the repulsive loss function significantly improves over the
MMD loss at no additional computational cost and outperforms other
representative loss functions. The proposed methods achieve an FID score of

under a linear drive using both exact numerical calculations and analytical
""independent crossing approximation"". Unlike the two-dimensional Kitaev model,
the three-dimensional Kitaev model reduces to a multilevel Landau-Zener problem
for each momentum. We show that for the slow quench, the defect density is
proportional to the quench rate $1/\tau$. We find that the zeros of the
relevant coupling between the levels determine the non-adiabatic condition for
the production of defects. The contour on which the energy spectrum becomes
gapless does not play an active role. The asymptotic behavior of the defect
density crucially depends on the way the system reaches the non-adiabatic
regime during the quenching process. We analytically show that defect
correlation varies as $\tau^{-1} e^{-A/\tau}$, where $A$ is a constant
independent of $\tau$. For the slow quench, the qualitative dependence of the
entropy (produced during the quenching process) on the quench time is the same
as that of the defect correlation, indicating a close connection between the
defect correlation and the entropy content of the final state. Possible
experimental realization of such quench dynamics is also described briefly.

In sharp contrast, the recently proposed Dual Principal Component Pursuit
(DPCP) method can provably handle subspaces of high dimension by solving a
non-convex $\ell_1$ optimization problem on the sphere. However, its geometric
analysis is based on quantities that are difficult to interpret and are not
amenable to statistical analysis. In this paper we provide a refined geometric

many outliers as the square of the number of inliers, thus improving upon other
provably correct robust PCA methods. We also propose a scalable Projected
Sub-Gradient Method method (DPCP-PSGM) for solving the DPCP problem and show it
admits linear convergence even though the underlying optimization problem is
non-convex and non-smooth. Experiments on road plane detection from 3D point

traditional RANSAC algorithm, which is one of the most popular methods for such

reformulated as the optimal switching problem of a hybrid system. The

drawbacks of local blur and halo artifact that may appear by Gaussian filter.
To avoid color distortion, the image is converted to the HSI color model, and
only the intensity channel is enhanced. Then a linear color restoration
algorithm is adopted to convert the enhanced intensity image back to the RGB
color model, which ensures the hue is constant and undistorted. Experimental
results show that the proposed method is effective to enhance both color and
gray images with low exposure and non-uniform illumination, resulting in better
visual quality than traditional method. At the same time, the objective

$(A\rtimes_{\alpha}G,\widehat\alpha)$ and $(B\rtimes_{\beta}G,\widehat\beta)$

this squeezing, one of which does not rely on calibration of shot noise.

timely MRI diagnosis, and to make this imaging modality available to routine
scans and to underdeveloped areas. With simplicity, no maintenance, no power
consumption, and low cost, permanent magnets or arrays are attractive to use as
a source of magnetic field to realize portability and low cost for a scanners.
However, when taking the Fourier imaging approach and using linear gradient
fields, homogeneous fields are required, thus either a bulky magnet is needed,
or the imaging volume is too small to image an organ if the magnet is scaled
down. Recently, with the progress on image reconstruction based on non-linear
gradient field, field patterns without spatial-linearity can be used as spatial
encoding magnetic fields to encode MRI signals for imaging. As a result, the
requirements for the homogeneity of the field can be relaxed, which allows
permanent magnets(arrays) with reduced sizes, reduced weight to image bigger
volumes covering organs such as a head. It offers chances to construct a truly
portable low-cost MRI scanner. For this exciting potential application,
permanent magnets(arrays) have attracted increased attention. A magnet(array)
is strongly associated with the imaging volume, reconstruction methods, and RF
excitation and coils, etc. through field patterns and homogeneity. This paper
offers a review on permanent magnets(arrays) of different kinds, especially
those can be used for spatial encoding towards the development of portable and
low-cost MRI systems. It is aimed to familiarize the readers with relevant
knowledge, literature, and the latest updates of the development on permanent
magnets for MRI. Perspectives on and challenges of using permanent magnets to
supply a patterned magnetic field, without spatial-linearity nor high
homogeneity, for reconstruction in a portable setup are discussed.

is essential for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). This step is required for
localizing nodes, achieving low-cost deployments, and identifying prerequisites
in location-based applications. Centralized graph algorithms are inapplicable
to a resource-limited WSN because of their high computation and communication
costs, whereas distributed approaches may miss a large number of theoretically
localizable nodes in a resource-limited WSN. In this paper, we propose an
efficient and effective distributed approach in order to address this problem.
Furthermore, we prove the correctness of our algorithm and analyze the reasons
our algorithm can find more localizable nodes while requiring fewer known
location nodes than existing algorithms, under the same network configurations.
The time complexity of our algorithm is linear with respect to the number of
nodes in a network. We conduct both simulations and real-world WSN experiments
to evaluate our algorithm under various network settings. The results show that
our algorithm significantly outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of
both the latency and the accuracy of localizability detection.

methods. Thus, this paper focuses on applying the fractal Julia sets to observe
the topological properties related to the signs and magnitudes of the real and

different power combinations were used to represent the fractal diagrams with
an algorithm that considers the mathematical model of Julia sets. The study
considers three type of loads: the first study considers the change of real
power when the reactive power is fixed; the second study deals with the change
of the reactive power when the real power is fixed; and finally, the third
study contemplates that both real and reactive powers change. Furthermore, the
fractal diagrams of the power in the four quadrants of the complex plane are
studied to identify the topological properties that each sign and magnitude
represent. A qualitative analysis of the diagrams helps to identify that the
complex power loads present some fractal graphic patterns, with respect to the
signs and magnitudes considered in the different quadrants of the complex
planes. The diagrams represented in the complex planes save a relation in the
forms and structure with other points studied, concluding that the power is
related to other figures in other quadrants. Thus, this result allows a new
study of the behavior of the power in an electrical circuit, showing a clear
relation of the different fractal diagrams that the Julia sets obtained.

explosions with similar energies demonstrated that a high growth factor of
Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities at the (C+O)/He composition interface combined
with a weak interaction of fast Rayleigh-Taylor plumes, where the reverse shock
occurs below the He/H interface, provides a sufficient condition for efficient
outward mixing of Ni-56 into the hydrogen envelope. This condition is realized
to the required extent only in one of the older stellar models, which yielded a
maximum velocity of around 3000 km/s for the bulk of ejected Ni-56, but failed
to reproduce the helium-core mass of 6 Msun inferred from the absolute
luminosity of the presupernova star. We conclude that none of the single-star

themselves towards a particular parity in their sums of digits, but our
empirical tests show a very strong bias; strong enough that we are able to
devise a test to reliably differentiate between collections of prime numbers

to create similar tests for products of primes. We are even able to test
""tainted"" sets with mixtures of primes and random numbers: as the percentage of
(randomly chosen) prime numbers in a set of random numbers is varied, we get a
reliable, linear change in our parity measure. For example, when we add up the
digits of prime numbers in base 10, their sum is significantly more likely to
be odd than even. This effect persists across base changes, although which
parity is more common might change. Note that the last digit being odd in base
10 simply reverses the parity. We have tested this for the first fifty million

However, existing methods inpaint lesions based on texture information derived
from local surrounding tissue, often leading to inconsistent inpainting and the
generation of artifacts such as intensity discrepancy and blurriness. Based on
these observations, we propose non-local partial convolutions (NLPC) that
integrates a Unet-like network with the non-local module. The non-local module
is exploited to capture long range dependencies between the lesion area and
remaining normal-appearing brain regions. Then, the lesion area is filled by
referring to normal-appearing regions with more similar features. This method
generates inpainted regions that appear more realistic and natural. Our

In
this paper a generic framework is developed to investigate the inhomogeneous
condensate in a system of fermions under the presence of rotation. It is a
self-consistent method basing on a set of relativistic BdG equations solved
with typical iteration algorithm. Taking the chiral condensate for example we
study rotational effects numerically and discover two inhomogeneous effects,
the local rotational suppression effect and centrifugal effect. They may have
significant impacts on the phase structure of various kinds of matter. Several
systems in different physics branches have been discussed in the paper.

"1901.01317","Jan Stenflo","Jan O. Stenflo","Dark energy as an emergent phenomenon",,,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The cosmological constant, which was introduced by Einstein a century ago to
allow for a static universe, experienced a revival two decades ago under the
label dark energy as a parameter to model the observed accelerated expansion of
the universe. Its physical nature has however remained enigmatic. Here we use
the Einstein equations without cosmological constant to show that the origin of
the accelerated expansion is not in the equations but has to do with the
boundary conditions related to the causal horizon, which exists because the age
of the universe is finite. Via transformations to conformal coordinates and
Euclidian spacetime we find a resonance condition that uniquely determines the
dimensionless parameter $\Omega_\Lambda$ that governs the observed cosmic
acceleration: $\Omega_\Lambda =\textstyle{2\over 3}\,(\pi\, t_H/t_c)^2$, where
$t_H$ is the Hubble time and $t_c$ is the conformal age of the universe. This
explanation leads to a somewhat modified cosmology, in which the expansion rate
of the early universe is 2.1 times faster than in the standard model. We show
that Big Bang nucleosynthesis calculations with the faster expansion rate
requires the mean baryon density to be raised to the level of the total matter
density to agree with the observed deuterium abundance. This appears to
eliminate the need to invoke the existence of some yet to be discovered exotic
particles to explain dark matter, since all of it may be baryonic while still
remaining consistent with the observed abundances of the light elements.

  Communication","12 pages, 10 figures. IEEE Transactions on Communications Journal,
  2020",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ubiquitous multicore processors nowadays rely on an integrated
packet-switched network for cores to exchange and share data. The performance
of these intra-chip networks is a key determinant of the processor speed and,
at high core counts, becomes an important bottleneck due to scalability issues.
To address this, several works propose the use of mm-wave wireless
interconnects for intra-chip communication and demonstrate that, thanks to
their low-latency broadcast and system-level flexibility, this new paradigm
could break the scalability barriers of current multicore architectures.
However, these same works assume 10+ Gb/s speeds and efficiencies close to 1
pJ/bit without a proper understanding on the wireless intra-chip channel. This
paper first demonstrates that such assumptions do not hold in the context of
commercial chips by evaluating losses and dispersion in them. Then, we leverage
the system's monolithic nature to engineer the channel, this is, to optimize
its frequency response by carefully choosing the chip package dimensions.
Finally, we exploit the static nature of the channel to adapt to it, pushing
efficiency-speed limits with simple tweaks at the physical layer. Our methods
reduce the path loss and delay spread of a simulated commercial chip by 47 dB
and 7.3x, respectively, enabling intra-chip wireless communications over 10
Gb/s and only 3.1 dB away from the dispersion-free case.

groups over fields of characteristic zero is described. The algorithm uses the
fact that the decomposition induces a partition of the invariant inner product
into a complete set of mutually orthogonal projectors. By expressing the
projectors through the basis elements of the centralizer ring of the
representation, the problem is reduced to solving systems of quadratic
equations. The current implementation of the algorithm is able to split
representations of dimensions up to hundreds of thousands. Examples of
calculations are given.
