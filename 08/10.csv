reliable estimation of the statistics of the output, provided that a suitable

is a research field that focuses on providing purely data-driven input-output

metamodel purely trained on data can yield pointwise predictions whose accuracy
is comparable to that of other ML regression models, such as neural networks
and support vector machines. The comparisons are performed on benchmark
datasets available from the literature. The methodology also enables the
quantification of the output uncertainties, and is robust to noise.
Furthermore, it enjoys additional desirable properties, such as good
performance for small training sets and simplicity of construction, with only

emitters and scalable optoelectronic applications. However, several physical
properties that characterize their behavior, such as charged defect ionization
energies, are difficult to simulate with conventional first-principles methods,
mainly because of the weak and anisotropic dielectric screening caused by the
reduced dimensionality. We establish fundamental principles for accurate and
efficient calculations of charged defect ionization energies and electronic
structure in ultrathin 2D materials. We propose to use the vacuum level as the
reference for defect charge transition levels (CTLs) because it gives robust
results insensitive to the level of theory, unlike commonly used band edge
positions. Furthermore, we determine the fraction of Fock exchange in hybrid
functionals for accurate band gaps and band edge positions of 2D materials by
enforcing the generalized Koopmans' condition of localized defect states. We
found the obtained fractions of Fock exchange vary significantly from 0.2 for
bulk $h$-BN to 0.4 for monolayer $h$-BN, whose band gaps are also in good
agreement with experimental results and calculated GW results. The combination
of these methods allows for reliable and efficient prediction of defect
ionization energies (difference between CTLs and band edge positions). We
motivate and generalize these findings with several examples including
different defects in monolayer to few-layer hexagonal boron nitride ($h$-BN),
monolayer MoS$_2$ and graphane. Finally, we show that increasing the number of
layers of $h$-BN systematically lowers defect ionization energies, mainly
through CTLs shifting towards vacuum, with conduction band minima kept almost
unchanged.

We consider observational constraints from iron-group elemental and isotopic
ratios, to compare with various models obtained with the most-realistic recent
treatment of electron captures. The nucleosynthesis is sensitive to the highest
white-dwarf central densities. Hence, nucleosynthesis yields can distinguish
high-density Chandrasekhar-mass models from lower-density burning models such
as white-dwarf mergers. We discuss new results of post-processing
nucleosynthesis for two spherical models (deflagration and/or delayed
detonation models) based upon new electron capture rates. We also consider
cylindrical and 3D explosion models (including deflagration,
delayed-detonation, or a violent merger model). Although there are
uncertainties in the observational constraints, we identify some trends in
observations and the models. We make a new comparison of the models with
elemental and isotopic ratios from five observed supernovae and three supernova
remnants. We find that the models and data tend to fall into two groups. In one
group low-density cores such as in a 3D merger model are slightly more
consistent with the nucleosynthesis data, while the other group is slightly
better identified with higher-density cores such as in single-degenerate 1D-3D
deflagration models. Hence, we postulate that both types of environments appear
to contribute nearly equally to observed SNIa. We also note that observational
constraints on the yields of $^{54}$Cr and $^{54}$Fe, if available, might be
used as a means to clarify the degree of geometrical symmetry of SNIa

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. One explanation for the popularity
of HMC algorithms is their excellent performance as the dimension $d$ of the
target becomes large: under conditions that are satisfied for many common
statistical models, optimally-tuned HMC algorithms have a running time that
scales like $d^{0.25}$. In stark contrast, the running time of the usual
Random-Walk Metropolis (RWM) algorithm, optimally tuned, scales like $d$. This
superior scaling of the HMC algorithm with dimension is attributed to the fact
that it, unlike RWM, incorporates the gradient information in the proposal
distribution. In this paper, we investigate a different scaling question: does
HMC beat RWM for highly $\textit{multimodal}$ targets? We find that the answer
is often $\textit{no}$. We compute the spectral gaps for both the algorithms
for a specific class of multimodal target densities, and show that they are
identical. The key reason is that, within one mode, the gradient is effectively
ignorant about other modes, thus negating the advantage the HMC algorithm
enjoys in unimodal targets. We also give heuristic arguments suggesting that
the above observation may hold quite generally. Our main tool for answering
this question is a novel simple formula for the conductance of HMC using
Liouville's theorem. This result allows us to compute the spectral gap of HMC
algorithms, for both the classical HMC with isotropic momentum and the recent
Riemannian HMC, for multimodal targets.

of the cross-validated errors of a large number of supervised learning models

fits a low rank model to learn the low-dimensional feature vectors for the

the feature vector for the new dataset. OBOE can find good models under
constraints on the number of models fit or the total time budget. To this end,
this paper develops a new heuristic for active learning in time-constrained
matrix completion based on optimal experiment design. Our experiments
demonstrate that OBOE delivers state-of-the-art performance faster than

and are hence perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they often lack
accurate shading. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep
conditional adversarial architecture for scribble based anime line art
colorization. Specifically, we integrate the conditional framework with WGAN-GP
criteria as well as the perceptual loss to enable us to robustly train a deep
network that makes the synthesized images more natural and real. We also
introduce a local features network that is independent of synthetic data. With
GANs conditioned on features from such network, we notably increase the
generalization capability over ""in the wild"" line arts. Furthermore, we collect
two datasets that provide high-quality colorful illustrations and authentic
line arts for training and benchmarking. With the proposed model trained on our
illustration dataset, we demonstrate that images synthesized by the presented
approach are considerably more realistic and precise than alternative
approaches.

production of heavy elements in core-collapse supernovae is strongly dependent
upon neutrino properties, like the mixing between different species of
neutrinos. In this work we study the effects of neutrino oscillations upon the
electron fraction as a function of the neutrino mixing parameters, for two
schemes: the $1+1$ scheme (one active neutrino and one sterile neutrino) and
the $2+1$ scheme (two active neutrinos and one sterile neutrino). We have
performed this analysis considering a core-collapse supernovae and determined
the physical conditions needed to activate the nuclear reaction chains involved
in the r-process. We found that the interactions of the neutrinos with matter
and among themselves and the initial amount of sterile neutrinos in the
neutrino-sphere might change the electron fraction, therefore affecting the
onset of the r-process. We have set constrains on the active-sterile neutrino
mixing parameters. They are the square-mass-difference $\Delta m^2_{14} $, the
mixing angle $\sin^2 2\theta_{14}$, and the hindrance factor $\xi_s $ for the
occupation of sterile neutrinos. The calculations have been performed for
different values of $X_{\alpha}$, which is the fraction of $\alpha$-particles.

gluon particles (scatterers) within the strongly coupled liquid quark-gluon
plasma (QGP) produced in heavy ion collisions. This is the closest one can come
to probing QGP via a scattering experiment and ultimately learning how a
strongly coupled liquid emerges from an asymptotically free gauge theory. The
short-distance, particulate, structure of liquid QGP can be revealed in events
in which a jet parton resolves, and scatters off, a parton from the droplet of
QGP. The probability for picking up significant transverse momentum via a
single scattering was calculated previously, but only in the limit of infinite
parton energy which means zero angle scattering. Here, we provide a leading
order perturbative QCD calculation of the Moli\`ere scattering probability for
incident partons with finite energy, scattering at a large angle. We set up a
thought experiment in which an incident parton with a finite energy scatters
off a parton constituent within a ""brick"" of QGP, which we treat as if it were
weakly coupled, as appropriate for scattering with large momentum transfer, and
compute the probability for a parton to show up at a nonzero angle with some
energy. We include all relevant channels, including those in which the parton
that shows up at a large angle was kicked out of the medium as well as the
Rutherford-like channel in which what is seen is the scattered incident parton.
The results that we obtain will serve as inputs to future jet Monte Carlo
calculations and can provide qualitative guidance for how to use future
precise, high statistics, suitably differential measurements of jet
modification in heavy ion collisions to find the scatterers within the QGP
liquid.

Specifically, we utilize the nonlinear geometry of data collected from a

enables the identification of nonlinear hybrid systems. This methodology
broadly empowers nonlinear system identification without constraining the data
locally in time and has direct connections to hybrid systems theory. We
demonstrate the success of this method on numerical examples including a

complex systems that switch between dynamic behaviors is integral to overcoming
modern challenges such as eradication of infectious diseases, the design of

allowing us to retain stable paths that would otherwise be removed. Our
experiments demonstrate that models that remove vulnerable variables and use

field theory of the boundary gravitons. This theory respects all of the
conformal field theory axioms except one: it is not modular invariant. The
coupling constant is $1/c$ with $c$ the central charge, and perturbation theory
in $1/c$ encodes loop contributions in the gravity dual. The QFT is a theory of
reparametrizations analogous to the Schwarzian description of nearly AdS$_2$
gravity, and has several features including: (i) it is ultraviolet-complete;
(ii) the torus partition function is the vacuum Virasoro character, which is
one-loop exact by a localization argument; (iii) it reduces to the Schwarzian
theory upon compactification; (iv) it provides a powerful new tool for
computing Virasoro blocks at large $c$ via a diagrammatic expansion. We use the
theory to compute several observables to one-loop order in the bulk, including
the ""heavy-light"" limit of the identity block. We also work out some
generalizations of this theory, including the boundary theory which describes
fluctuations around two-sided eternal black holes.

generates sharp cutoffs in the accompanying antineutrino spectrum at the beta

interfere with measuring the effect of a neutrino mass hierarchy on an
oscillated nuclear reactor antineutrino spectrum. These sawtooth-like features
will appear in detailed reactor antineutrino spectra, with characteristic
energy scales similar to the oscillation period critical to neutrino mass
hierarchy determination near a 53 km baseline. However, these sawtooth-like
distortions are found to contribute at a magnitude of only a few percent
relative to the mass hierarchy-dependent oscillation pattern in Fourier space.
In the Fourier cosine and sine transforms, the features that encode a neutrino
mass hierarchy dominate by over sixteen (thirty-three) times in prominence to
the maximal contribution of the sawtooth-like distortions from the detailed
energy spectrum, given $3.2\%/\sqrt{E_\mathrm{vis.}/\mathrm{MeV}}$ (perfect)
detector energy resolution. The effect of these distortions is shown to be
negligible even when the uncertainties in the reactor spectrum, oscillation
parameters, and counting statistics are considered. This result is shown to
hold even when the opposite hierarchy oscillation patterns are nearly
degenerate in energy space, if energy response nonlinearities are controlled to
below 0.5\%. Therefore with accurate knowledge of detector energy response, the
sawtooth-like features in reactor antineutrino spectra will not significantly
impede neutrino mass hierarchy measurements using reactor antineutrinos.

increase with stellar age, commonly interpreted as vertical heating through
orbit scattering. Here we map the vertical actions of disk stars as a function
of age ($\tau\le$ 8 Gyrs) and across a large range of Galactocentric radii,
$\overline{R}_{\rm GC}$, drawing on APOGEE and Gaia data. We fit
$\widehat{J_z}(\overline{R}_{\rm GC},\tau )$ as a combination of the vertical
action at birth, $\widehat{J_{z,0}}$, and subsequent heating $\widehat{\Delta
J_z}_{\, {\rm 1Gyr}}(\overline{R}_{\rm GC})$ that scales as
$\tau^{\gamma(\overline{R}_{\rm GC})}$. The inferred birth temperature,
$\widehat{J_{z,0}}(\overline{R}_{\rm GC})$ is 1 kpc km/s for 3 kpc <
$\overline{R}_{\rm GC}$ < 10 kpc, consistent with the ISM velocity dispersion;
but it rapidly rises outward, to 8 kpc km/s for $\overline{R}_{\rm GC}$ = 14
kpc, likely reflecting the stars' birth in a warped or flared gas disk. We find
the heating rate $\widehat{\Delta J_z}_{\, {\rm 1Gyr}}$ to be modest and nearly
constant across all radii, 1.6 kpc km/s Gyr$^{-1}$. The stellar age dependence
$\gamma$ gently grows with Galactocentric radius, from $\gamma \simeq$ 1 for
$\overline{R}_{\rm GC}\lesssim R_\odot$ to $\gamma \simeq$ 1.3 at
$\overline{R}_{\rm GC}$ =14 kpc. The observed $J_z - \tau$ relation at all
radii is considerably steeper ($\gamma\gtrsim$ 1) than the time dependence
theoretically expected from orbit scattering, $J_z\propto t^{0.5}$. We
illustrate how this conundrum can be resolved if we also account for the fact
that at earlier epochs the scatterers were more common, and the restoring force
from the stellar disk surface mass density was low. Our analysis may re-instate
gradual orbital scattering as a plausible and viable mechanism to explain the
age-dependent vertical motions of disk stars.

at high redshifts and high ultraviolet/radio AGN luminosities. Unfortunately,
the luminosity bias in our sample, with high-luminosity AGNs arising at high

redshift evolution or AGN luminosity is the primary cause of the weaker

angle ~35{\deg}. The derived kinematics are consistent with gas flowing along
the conical surface with a constant velocity of 9.3+/-0.7 km/s. We detect small
rotation signatures (Vphi x sin(i) $\in$ [0.1;0.5] km/s) in the same sense as
the underlying circumstellar disk. From these rotation signatures we infer an

altitudes z<250 au. We also report the detection of small amplitude wiggling
(1.2{\deg}) of the CO axis around an average inclination to the line of sight

  The derived morphology and kinematics of the CO cavity are compatible with
expectations from a slow disk wind, originating either through

detected, with old stars found in high percentages beyond this radius. In this
work we investigate the origin of such a reversal in stellar age gradient, by
using a simulated M33 analogue from the Constrained Local UniversE Simulations
(CLUES). The simulated M33 is similar to the observed one in terms of mass,
rotation velocity, surface brightness and, similar to what has been reported in
observations, shows a stellar age turnaround at large radii. We demonstrate
that this reversal is mostly a result of stellar accretion from old satellite
galaxies and, to a lesser extent, of stellar migration of in-situ stars. The
old accreted stars, with formation times tf < 4 Gyrs, are kinematically hot and
can be differentiated from the in-situ stars by their high velocity dispersion
and the fact that they do not have rotationally-supported orbits. In the
future, obtaining kinematic information of the stars in the outskirt of M33

directly detect the redshifted 21-cm signal from the neutral hydrogen present

neutral intergalactic medium can dominate the fluctuations in the 21-cm signal
from this time. This heating depends on the abundance, clustering, and
properties of the X-ray sources present, which remain highly uncertain. We
present a suite of three new large-volume, 349\,Mpc a side, fully numerical
radiative transfer simulations including QSO-like sources, extending the work
previously presented in Ross et al. (2017). The results show that our QSOs have
a modest contribution to the heating budget, yet significantly impact the 21-cm
signal. Initially, the power spectrum is boosted on large scales by heating
from the biased QSO-like sources, before decreasing on all scales. Fluctuations
from images of the 21-cm signal with resolutions corresponding to SKA1-Low at
the appropriate redshifts are well above the expected noise for deep
integrations, indicating that imaging could be feasible for all the X-ray
source models considered. The most notable contribution of the QSOs is a
dramatic increase in non-Gaussianity of the signal, as measured by the skewness
and kurtosis of the 21-cm probability distribution functions. However, in the
case of late Lyman-$\alpha$ saturation, this non-Gaussianity could be
dramatically decreased particularly when heating occurs earlier. We conclude
that increased non-Gaussianity is a promising signature of rare X-ray sources
at this time, provided that Lyman-$\alpha$ saturation occurs before heating
dominates the 21-cm signal.

approach. We develop a simple model for planetary growth including pebble and
gas accretion, and orbital migration in an evolving protoplanetary disk. The
model is run for a population of 2000 stars with a range of disk masses and
radii, and initial protoplanet orbits. The resulting planetary distribution is
compared with the observed population of extrasolar planets, and the model
parameters are improved iteratively using a particle swarm optimization scheme.
The characteristics of the final planetary systems are mainly controlled by the
pebble isolation mass, which is the mass of a planet that perturbs nearby gas
enough to halt the inward flux of drifting pebbles and stop growth. The pebble
isolation mass increases with orbital distance so that giant planet cores can
only form in the outer disk. Giants migrate inwards, populating a wide range of
final orbital distances. The best model fits have large initial protoplanet
masses, short pebble drift timescales, low disk viscosities, and short
atmospheric cooling times, all of which promote rapid growth. The model
successfully reproduces the observed frequency and distribution of giant
planets and brown dwarfs. The fit for super Earths is poorer for single-planet
systems, but improves steadily when more protoplanets are included. Although
the study was designed to match the extrasolar planet distribution, analogs of
the Solar System form in 1-2% of systems that contain at least 4 protoplanets.

photometry corrected for Milky Way dust extinction. This has motivated the
creation of a number of ""Galactic"" dust maps. We investigate whether these maps
are contaminated by extragalactic signals using the clustering-redshift
technique, i.e., by measuring a set of angular cross-correlations with
spectroscopic objects as a function of redshift. Our tomographic analysis
reveals imprints of extragalactic large-scale structure patterns in nine out of
10 Galactic dust maps, including all infrared-based maps as well as ""stellar""
reddening maps. When such maps are used for extinction corrections, this
extragalactic contamination introduces redshift- and scale-dependent biases in
photometric estimates at the millimagnitude level. It can affect both
object-based analyses, such as the estimation of the Hubble diagram with
supernovae, as well as spatial statistics. The bias can be appreciable when
measuring angular correlation functions with low amplitudes, such as
lensing-induced correlations or angular correlations for sources distributed
over a broad redshift range. As expected, we do not detect any extragalactic
contamination for the dust map inferred from 21cm HI observations. Such a map
provides an alternative to widely used infrared-based maps but relies on the
assumption of a constant dust-to-gas ratio. We note that, using the WISE 12
micron map sensitive to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), an indirect
dust tracer, we detect the diffuse extragalactic PAH background up to $z\sim2$.
Finally, we provide a procedure to minimize the level of biased magnitude
corrections in maps with extragalactic imprints.

female dominance of nursing to male dominance of mathematics. It is not clear
whether there is also a citation imbalance, with some claiming that
male-authored research tends to be more cited. No previous study has assessed
gender differences in the readers of academic research on a large scale,
however. In response, this article assesses whether there are gender
differences in the average citations and/or Mendeley readers of academic
publications. Field normalised logged Scopus citations and Mendeley readers
from mid-2018 for articles published in 2014 were investigated for articles
with first authors from India, Spain, Turkey, the UK and the USA in up to 251
fields with at least 50 male and female authors. Although female-authored
research is less cited in Turkey (-4.0%) and India (-3.6%), it is marginally
more cited in Spain (0.4%), the UK (0.4%), and the USA (0.2%). Female-authored
research has fewer Mendeley readers in India (-1.1%) but more in Spain (1.4%),
Turkey (1.1%), the UK (2.7%) and the USA (3.0%). Thus, whilst there may be
little practical gender difference in citation impact in countries with mature
science systems, the higher female readership impact suggests a wider audience
for female-authored research. The results show that the conclusions from a
gender analysis depend on the field normalisation method. A theoretically
informed decision must therefore be made about which normalisation to use. The
results also suggest that arithmetic mean-based field normalisation is
favourable to males.

have received a wealth of coverage in scientific journals, technical blogs, and
implementation guides. However, in most articles, the inference formulas for
the LSTM network and its parent, RNN, are stated axiomatically, while the
training formulas are omitted altogether. In addition, the technique of
""unrolling"" an RNN is routinely presented without justification throughout the
literature. The goal of this paper is to explain the essential RNN and LSTM
fundamentals in a single document. Drawing from concepts in signal processing,
we formally derive the canonical RNN formulation from differential equations.
We then propose and prove a precise statement, which yields the RNN unrolling
technique. We also review the difficulties with training the standard RNN and
address them by transforming the RNN into the ""Vanilla LSTM"" network through a
series of logical arguments. We provide all equations pertaining to the LSTM
system together with detailed descriptions of its constituent entities. Albeit
unconventional, our choice of notation and the method for presenting the LSTM
system emphasizes ease of understanding. As part of the analysis, we identify
new opportunities to enrich the LSTM system and incorporate these extensions
into the Vanilla LSTM network, producing the most general LSTM variant to date.
The target reader has already been exposed to RNNs and LSTM networks through
numerous available resources and is open to an alternative pedagogical
approach. A Machine Learning practitioner seeking guidance for implementing our

order solar masses, to test the hypothesis that grain property variations cause
the apparently low gas-to-dust ratios that have been measured in those clouds.
Maps of the clouds were constructed from WISE data and directly compared to the
maps of dust optical depth from Planck. The mid-infrared emission per unit dust
optical depth has a significant trend toward lower values at higher optical
depths. The trend can be quantitatively explained by extinction of starlight
within the clouds. The relative amounts of PAH and very small grains traced by
WISE, compared to large grains tracked by Planck, are consistent with being
constant. The temperature of the large grains significantly decreases for
clouds with larger dust optical depth; this trend is partially due to dust
property variations but is primarily due to extinction of starlight. We updated
the prediction for molecular hydrogen column density, taking into account
variations in dust properties, and find it can explain the observed dust
optical depth per unit gas column density. Thus the low gas-to-dust ratios in
the clouds are most likely due to `dark gas' that is molecular hydrogen.

formally be used to show that Chern-Simons-gauged {\it critical} (Gross-Neveu)
fermions are also dual to gauged `{\it regular}' scalars at every order in a
$1/N$ expansion, provided both theories are well-defined (when one fine-tunes
the two relevant parameters of each of these theories to zero). In the strict
large $N$ limit these `quasi-bosonic' theories appear as fixed lines
parameterized by $x_6$, the coefficient of a sextic term in the potential.
While $x_6$ is an exactly marginal deformation at leading order in large $N$,
it develops a non-trivial $\beta$ function at first subleading order in $1/N$.
We demonstrate that the beta function is a cubic polynomial in $x_6$ at this
order in $1/N$, and compute the coefficients of the cubic and quadratic terms
as a function of the 't Hooft coupling. We conjecture that flows governed by
this leading large $N$ beta function have three fixed points for $x_6$ at every
non-zero value of the 't Hooft coupling, implying the existence of three
distinct regular bosonic and three distinct dual critical fermionic conformal
fixed points, at every value of the 't Hooft coupling. We analyze the phase
structure of these fixed point theories at zero temperature. We also construct
dual pairs of large $N$ fine-tuned renormalization group flows from
supersymmetric ${\cal N}=2$ Chern-Simons-matter theories, such that one of the
flows ends up in the IR at a regular boson theory while its dual partner flows
to a critical fermion theory. This construction suggests that the duality
between these theories persists at finite $N$, at least when $N$ is large.

an emission band at 1.707 $\mu$m thought to be produced by hot SO molecules
directly ejected from a volcanic vent; the observations were made the NIRSPEC
instrument on the Keck II telescope while Io was in eclipse by Jupiter on three
nights in 2012-2016, and included two observations with 10x higher spectral
resolution than all prior observations of this band. These high-resolution
spectra reveal a contribution to the SO emission from gas reservoirs at both
high and low rotational temperatures. The scenario preferred by de Pater et al.
(2002) for the source of the SO gas - direct volcanic emission of SO in the
excited state - is consistent with these two temperature components if the
local gas density is high enough that rotational energy can be lost
collisionally before the excited electronic state spontaneously decays. Under
this scenario, the required bulk atmospheric gas density and surface pressure
are $n\sim 10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$ and 1-3 nbar, consistent with observations and
modeling of Io's dayside atmosphere at altitudes below 10 km. The
low-temperature gas component is warmer for observations in the first 20
minutes of eclipse (in Dec 2015) than after Io had been in shadow for 1.5 hours
(in May 2016), suggesting cooling of the atmosphere during eclipse. Excess
emission is consistently observed at 1.69 $\mu$m, which cannot be matched by
two-temperature gas models but can be matched by models that over-populate high
rotational states. Finally, a comparison of the total band strengths observed
across eight dates from 1999-2016 reveals no significant dependence on thermal
hot spot activity (including Loki Patera), on the time since Io has been in
shadow, nor on the phase of Io's orbit at the time of observation.

where the extent to which different clusters are overlapped can differ. Most
methods have a parameter to fix the level of fuzziness. However, the
appropriate level of fuzziness depends on the application at hand. This paper
presents Entropy $c$-Means (ECM), a method of fuzzy clustering that
simultaneously optimizes two contradictory objective functions, resulting in
the creation of fuzzy clusters with different levels of fuzziness. This allows
ECM to identify clusters with different degrees of overlap. ECM optimizes the
two objective functions using two multi-objective optimization methods,
Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), and Multiobjective
Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D). We also propose a
method to select a suitable trade-off clustering from the Pareto front.
Experiments on challenging synthetic datasets as well as real-world datasets

Recent chemical modelling of the outer, colder regions of a protoplanetary disk
midplane has shown production of O$_{2}$ ice at the same abundance as that
measured in the comet. An updated chemical kinetics code is utilised here to
evolve chemistry under pre-Solar nebula midplane conditions. Four different
chemical starting conditions, and the effects of various chemical parameters
are tested. The parameter space investigation revealed a sweet spot for
production of O$_{2}$ ice at an abundance matching those in 67P and 1P, and
O$_{3}$ and H$_{2}$O$_{2}$ ices abundances matching those in 67P. This means
that there is a radial region in the pre-Solar nebula from 120-150 AU, within
which O$_{2}$ could have been produced in-situ via ice chemistry on grain
surfaces. However, it is apparent that there is a high degree of sensitivity of
the chemistry to the assumed chemical parameters (e.g. binding energy,
activation barrier width, and quantum tunnelling barrier). Hence, because the
more likely scenario starting with a percentage of elemental oxygen locked in
O$_{2}$ also reproduces the O$_{2}$ ice abundance in 67P at early stages, this
supports previous suggestions that the cometary O$_{2}$ ice could have a
primordial origin.

Multitask learning aims to improve model performance on a target task by
jointly learning additional auxiliary tasks and has been used in disparate
areas of machine learning. However, its utility when applied to EHR data has
not been established, and prior work suggests that its benefits are
inconsistent. We present experiments that elucidate when multitask learning
with neural nets improves performance for phenotyping using EHR data relative
to neural nets trained for a single phenotype and to well-tuned logistic
regression baselines. We find that multitask neural nets consistently
outperform single-task neural nets for rare phenotypes but underperform for
relatively more common phenotypes. The effect size increases as more auxiliary
tasks are added. Moreover, multitask learning reduces the sensitivity of neural
nets to hyperparameter settings for rare phenotypes. Last, we quantify
phenotype complexity and find that neural nets trained with or without
multitask learning do not improve on simple baselines unless the phenotypes are
sufficiently complex.

economics, business, and other fields of research. % It helps us infer the
causality between two seemingly unrelated set of events. For example, if
consumer spending in the United States declines, it has spillover effects on
economies that depend on the U.S. as their largest export market. In this
paper, we aim to infer the causation that results in spillover effects between
pairs of entities (or units), we call this effect as \textit{paired spillover}.
To achieve this, we leverage the recent developments in variational inference
and deep learning techniques to propose a generative model called Linked Causal
Variational Autoencoder (LCVA). Similar to variational autoencoders (VAE), LCVA
incorporates an encoder neural network to learn the latent attributes and a
decoder network to reconstruct the inputs. However, unlike VAE, LCVA treats the
\textit{latent attributes as confounders that are assumed to affect both the
treatment and the outcome of units}. Specifically, given a pair of units $u$
and $\bar{u}$, their individual treatment and outcomes, the encoder network of
LCVA samples the confounders by conditioning on the observed covariates of $u$,
the treatments of both $u$ and $\bar{u}$ and the outcome of $u$. Once inferred,
the latent attributes (or confounders) of $u$ captures the spillover effect of
$\bar{u}$ on $u$. Using a network of users from job training dataset (LaLonde
(1986)) and co-purchase dataset from Amazon e-commerce domain, we show that
LCVA is significantly more robust than existing methods in capturing spillover
effects.

synthetic aperture focusing technique (SAFT) because it produces acceptable
results in real time. A few regularized inversion techniques with linear models
have been proposed which can improve on SAFT, but they tend to make simplifying
assumptions that do not address how to obtain reconstructions from large real
data sets. In this paper, we propose a model-based iterative reconstruction
(MBIR) algorithm designed for scanning UNDE systems. To further reduce some of
the artifacts in the results, we enhance the forward model to account for the
transmitted beam profile, the occurrence of direct arrival signals, and the
correlation between scans from adjacent regions. Next, we combine the forward
model with a spatially variant prior model to account for the attenuation of
deeper regions. We also present an algorithm to jointly reconstruct
measurements from large data sets. Finally, using simulated and extensive
experimental data, we show MBIR results and demonstrate how we can improve over
SAFT as well as existing regularized inversion techniques.

are derived for secrecy outage probability (SOP), probability of non-zero
secrecy capacity (PNZ), and average secrecy capacity (ASC). These expressions
are given in terms of either univariate or bivariate Fox's $H$-function. In
order to show the comprehensive effectiveness of our derivations, three metrics

in literature due to the difficulty of achieving closed-from expressions. In
order to validate the accuracy of our analytical results, Monte-Carlo
simulations are subsequently performed for the special case $\alpha-\mu$ fading

propagate error feedback forward through the network. Architectural constraints
on connectivity are virtually eliminated for error feedback in the brain;
systematic backward connectivity is not used or needed to deliver error
feedback. Feedback as a means of assigning credit to neurons earlier in the
forward pathway for their contribution to the final output is thought to be
used in learning in the brain. How the brain solves the credit assignment
problem is unclear. In machine learning, error backpropagation is a highly
successful mechanism for credit assignment in deep multilayered networks.
Backpropagation requires symmetric reciprocal connectivity for every neuron.
From a biological perspective, there is no evidence of such an architectural
constraint, which makes backpropagation implausible for learning in the brain.
This architectural constraint is reduced with the use of random feedback
weights. Models using random feedback weights require backward connectivity
patterns for every neuron, but avoid symmetric weights and reciprocal
connections. In this paper, we practically remove this architectural
constraint, requiring only a backward loop connection for effective error
feedback. We propose reusing the forward connections to deliver the error
feedback by feeding the outputs into the input receiving layer. This mechanism,
Error Forward-Propagation, is a plausible basis for how error feedback occurs
deep in the brain independent of and yet in support of the functionality
underlying intricate network architectures. We show experimentally that
recurrent neural networks with two and three hidden layers can be trained using
Error Forward-Propagation on the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, achieving
$1.90\%$ and $11\%$ generalization errors respectively.

of the problem of fluid flow in a finite naturally fractured reservoir with
inner and outer boundaries having constant and time-dependent conditions,
respectively. We assume that the reservoir has a producing well, with either
constant terminal pressure or constant terminal rate, while the outer boundary
has either an influx recharge or constant pressure. Using these case studies,
we show that a part of the inverse transformation given by Cinelli can be
expressed as closed formulas for long time solutions, at the same time that
make it possible to capture the inhomogeneous condition and speed up the
convergence of solutions. For Neumann-Neumann conditions, we show that the
inverse expression of Cinelli is incomplete. In addition, an analysis of the
flow characteristic curves in a reservoir with influx recharge is presented.
The drawdown pressure curves are used to elucidate the statement that the

light beams or creating two versions of the same image. Such mirrors do not
exist in electron optics, although they could be beneficial in existing
techniques such as electron interferometry and holography and enable novel
electron imaging and spectroscopy techniques. We propose a design for an
electron beam splitter using the concept of quantum interaction-free
measurement (IFM). The design combines an electron resonator with a weak phase
grating. Fast switching gates allow electrons to enter and exit the resonator.
While in the resonator, the phase grating transfers intensity from the direct
beam into one of the weakly diffracted beams at each pass. To make the beam
splitter an efficient two-port splitter, the intensity in all other diffracted
beams is blocked by an aperture. The IFM principle minimizes the loss of total
intensity by this aperture. We use a scattering matrix method to analyze the
performance of the beam splitter, including the effects of inelastic scattering
in the phase grating. This design can be generalized to beam splitters for not
only electrons, but also photons, neutrons, atoms, and other quantum mechanical
systems.

with individual heterogeneity and attrition. The method is motivated by the
fact that attrition bias is often encountered in Big Data applications. For
example, many users sign-up for the latest program but few remain active users
several months later, making the evaluation of such interventions inherently
very challenging. Building on earlier work by Hausman and Wise (1979), we
provide a simple identification strategy that leads to a two-step estimation
procedure. In the first step, the coefficients of interest in the selection
equation are consistently estimated using parametric or nonparametric methods.
In the second step, standard panel quantile methods are employed on a subset of
weighted observations. The estimator is computationally easy to implement in
Big Data applications with a large number of subjects. We investigate the
conditions under which the parameter estimator is asymptotically Gaussian and
we carry out a series of Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the finite
sample properties of the estimator. Lastly, using a simulation exercise, we
apply the method to the evaluation of a recent Time-of-Day electricity pricing
experiment inspired by the work of Aigner and Hausman (1980).

larger sample. In addition we include stellar kinematic and stellar population

illustrate the potential of this release by presenting the distribution of
~350,000 stellar velocity dispersion measurements from individual spaxels as a
function of R/R_e, divided in four galaxy mass bins. In the highest stellar
mass bin (log (M_star/M_sun)>11), the velocity dispersion strongly increases
towards the centre, whereas below log (M_star/M_sun)<10 we find no evidence for
a clear increase in the central velocity dispersion. This suggests a transition
mass around log (M_star/M_sun) ~10 for galaxies with or without a

traffic control problem, there is a lack of models addressing the more imminent
transitional stage wherein legacy and autonomous vehicles share the urban
infrastructure. We address this gap by introducing a new policy for stochastic
network traffic control involving both classes of vehicles. We conjecture that
network links will have dedicated lanes for autonomous vehicles which provide
access to traffic intersections and combine traditional green signal phases
with autonomous vehicle-restricted signal phases named blue phases. We propose
a new pressure-based, decentralized, hybrid network control policy that
activates selected movements at intersections based on the solution of
mixed-integer linear programs. We prove that the proposed policy is stable,
i.e. maximizes network throughput, under conventional travel demand conditions.
We conduct numerical experiments to test the proposed policy under varying
proportions of autonomous vehicles. Our experiments reveal that considerable
trade-offs exist in terms of vehicle-class travel time based on the level of
market penetration of autonomous vehicles. Further, we find that the proposed
hybrid network control policy improves on traditional green phase traffic
signal control for high levels of congestion, thus helping in quantifying the
potential benefits of autonomous vehicles in urban networks.

First-principles density-functional theory (DFT) calculations have typically
been used to obtain the DOS despite the considerable computation cost. Herein,
we report a fast pattern learning method for predicting the DOS patterns of not
only bulk structures but also surface structures in multi-component alloy
systems by a principal component analysis. Within this framework, we use only
four features to define the composition, atomic structure, and surfaces of
alloys, which are the d-orbital occupation ratio, coordination number, mixing
factor, and the inverse of miller indices. While the DFT method scales as
O(N^3) in which N is the number of electrons in the system size, our pattern
learning method can scale as O(1) regardless of N. Furthermore, our method
provides a pattern similarity of 91~98% compared to DFT calculations. This
reveals that our learning method will be an alternative that can break the
trade-off relationship between accuracy and speed that is well known in the
field of electronic structure calculations.

learns about dangerous pathogens and discriminates them from safe

immunological recognition. The binding affinity between the receptors and
antigenic peptides mainly determines immunological recognition followed by
subsequent responses. Is the integrated binding affinity sufficient to probe
the digital information of peptide sequences? To answer this fundamental
question, we examined whether the affinity-based discrimination of peptide
sequences is learnable and generalizable by artificial neural networks (ANNs)
that process the digital information of receptors and peptides. We made use of
large scale high-throughput data of T-cell receptors (TCRs) and open-source
peptides amino acid sequences as the input layer data, and computationally
examined the success and failure of immune recognition based on the pairwise
binding energy of their amino acid sequences as output layer data. Machine
learning successfully captured the relevant information of molecular
interactions and discriminated between strong and weak affinity pairs. This
suggests the potential applicability of artificial neural networks to predict
the immune responsiveness of certain antigenic peptides once their sequence

acids: with and without considering the amino acid strength. The sequences with
heterogeneous strengths of amino acids diminished TCR ""reading"" of the exact

stars has become a hot issue among the scientific community of debris disks.
Hot grains must have been enormously accumulated near their sublimation zones,
but it is a mystery how such a high concentration of hot grains is sustained.
The most difficult conundrum is that the size of hot dust grains is estimated
to lie in the submicrometer range, while submicrometer-sized grains are
instantly swept away from near-stellar environments by stellar radiation
pressure. One and only mechanism proposed for prolonging the residence time of
hot grains in the near-stellar environments is trapping of charged
nanoparticles by stellar magnetic fields. We revisit the model of magnetic
grain trapping around main-sequence stars of various spectral classes by taking
into account sublimation and electric charging of the grains. The model of
magnetic grain trapping predicts that hot dust grains are present in the
vicinity of main-sequence stars with high rotation velocities and intermediate
magnetic-field strengths. On the contrary, we find that the detection of hot
dust grains has no correlation with the rotation velocities of central stars
nor the magnetic field strengths of the stars. Our numerical evaluation of
electric grain charging indicates that the surface potential of
submicrometer-sized grains in the vicinity of main-sequence stars is typically
4-5 V, which is one order of magnitude smaller than the value assumed by the
model of magnetic grain trapping. On the basis of our numerical simulation on
sublimation of dust grains in the vicinity of a star, it turns out that their
lives end due to sublimation in a timescale much shorter than the period of one
revolution at the gyroradius. It is, therefore, infeasible to dynamically
extend the dwell time of hot grains inside the sublimation zone by magnetic

Myr, most of previous chemical evolution models indicate that the observed
early appearance and large dispersion of [r/Fe] in Galactic halo stars at
[Fe/H] < -2.5 favors shorter coalescence times of 1-10 Myr. We argue that this
is not the case for the models assuming the formation of the Galactic halo from
clustering of subhalos with different star formation histories as suggested by
Ishimaru et al. (2015). We present a stochastic chemical evolution model of the
subhalos, in which the site of the r-process is assumed to be mainly NSMs with
a coalescence timescale of 100 Myr. In view of the scarcity of NSMs, their
occurrence in each subhalo is computed with a Monte Carlo method. Our results
show that the less massive subhalos evolve at lower metallicities and generate
highly r-process-enhanced stars. An assembly of these subhalos leaves behind
the large star-to-star scatters of [r/Fe] in the Galactic halo as observed.
However, the observed scatters of [Sr/Ba] at low metallicities indicate the
presence of an additional site that partially contributes to the enrichment of
light neutron-capture elements such as Sr. The high enhancements of [r/Fe] at
low metallicities found in our low-mass subhalo models also qualitatively
reproduce the abundance signatures of the stars in the recently discovered
ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Reticulum II. Therefore, our results suggest NSMs as
the dominant sources of r-process elements in the Galactic halo.

high values of K (up to 800km s^-1). Such systems are born in very young

equilibria might be the same, still systems may resist to switch from an
unfavored equilibrium to a favored one. In this paper we investigate occurrence
of such phenomenon in economic networks. In times of crisis when governments
intend to stimulate economy, a relevant question is on the proper size of
stimulus bill. To address the answer, we emphasize the role of hysteresis in
economic networks. In times of crises, firms and corporations cut their
productions; now since their level of activity is correlated, metastable
features in the network become prominent. This means that economic networks
resist against the recovery actions. To measure the size of resistance in the
network against recovery, we deploy the XY model. Though theoretically the XY
model has no hysteresis, when it comes to the kinetic behavior in the
deterministic regimes, we observe a dynamic hysteresis. We find that to
overcome the hysteresis of the network, a minimum size of stimulation is needed
for success. Our simulations show that as long as the networks are
Watts-Strogatz, such minimum is independent of the characteristics of the
networks.

tackle tracking and camera control tasks separately, and the resulting system
is difficult to tune jointly. These methods also require significant human
efforts for image labeling and expensive trial-and-error system tuning in the
real world. To address these issues, we propose, in this paper, an end-to-end

is adopted for the direct frame-to-action prediction. We further propose an
environment augmentation technique and a customized reward function, which are
crucial for successful training. The tracker trained in simulators (ViZDoom and
Unreal Engine) demonstrates good generalization behaviors in the case of unseen
object moving paths, unseen object appearances, unseen backgrounds, and
distracting objects. The system is robust and can restore tracking after
occasional lost of the target being tracked. We also find that the tracking
ability, obtained solely from simulators, can potentially transfer to
real-world scenarios. We demonstrate successful examples of such transfer, via
experiments over the VOT dataset and the deployment of a real-world robot using
the proposed active tracker trained in simulation.

Thanks to the close distances of our targets, dwarf galaxies around them can be
identified as extended, diffuse galaxies. By applying a surface brightness cut
together with a careful visual screening to remove artifacts and background
contamination, we construct a sample of dwarf galaxies. The luminosity function
(LF) of one of the targets is broadly consistent with that of the MW, but the
other has a more abundant dwarf population. Numerical simulations by Okamoto

demonstrating the importance of addressing the missing satellite problem with a
statistically representative sample. We also characterize the projected spatial
distributions of the satellites and do not observe strong evidence for

  We introduce PRECISION, an algorithm that uses \emph{Probabilistic

small fraction of packets, PRECISION simplifies the access to stateful memory
to conform with RMT limitations and achieves higher accuracy than previous
heavy hitter detection algorithms that avoid recirculation. We also analyze the
effect of each architectural constraint on the measurement accuracy and provide

unprecedented high-quality rendering of clothing deformation sequences, where
fine wrinkles from (real) high resolution observations can be recovered. In

two-photon process $\gamma^* \gamma \rightarrow h \bar{h}$ which is accessible
at KEKB. Namely, the GDAs are the $s$-$t$ crossed quantities of the GPDs. In
2016, the differential cross section of the process $\gamma^* \gamma
\rightarrow \pi^0 \pi^0$ was measured by the Belle collaboration in the
$e^+e^-$collision , so that the pion GDAs can be obtained by analyzing the
Belle data. Expressing the GDAs with a few parameters, we determined the GDAs
by a $\chi^2$ analysis . The form factors of the quark energy-momentum tensor
are obtained from the determined GDAs. Then, we calculated the mass radius as
0.56-0.69 fm for the pion by using the form factor. This is the first study on
gravitational form factors and radius of hadrons from actual experimental
measurements . The Belle II will start taking data in 2018 by the upgraded
SuperKEKB. Therefore, much accurate data are expected for the pion, and other
hadron-pair productions will be measured in the near future. The GDA studies
are valuable for understanding not only the 3D structure but also gravitational
properties of hadrons.

discovered with very short orbital periods ranging from 250 min down to 68 min.
A pre-CV consists of a white dwarf or hot subdwarf primary and a low-mass
companion star, where the companion star has successfully ejected the common
envelope of the primary progenitor, but mass transfer from the companion star
to the primary has not yet commenced. In this short-period range, a substantial
fraction of the companion stars are likely to be either brown dwarfs with
masses $\lesssim 0.07 \, M_\odot$ or stars at the bottom of the MS ($\lesssim
0.1 M_\odot$). The discovery of these short-period pre-CVs raises the question
-- what is the shortest possible orbital period of such systems? We ran 500
brown dwarf/low-mass main sequence models with {\tt MESA} that cover the mass
range from 0.002 to 0.1 $M_\odot$. We find the shortest possible orbital period
is 40 min with a corresponding brown dwarf mass of 0.07 $M_\odot$ for an age
equal to a Hubble time. We discuss the past evolution of these systems through
the common envelope and suggest that many of the systems with present day white
dwarf primaries may have exited the common envelope with the primary as a
helium burning hot subdwarf. We also characterize the future evolution of the
observed systems, which includes a phase as CVs below the conventional period
minimum.

reproduce the cosmic evolution of galaxy properties predicted by the

baryonic mass, star-forming gas mass and star formation rate at $z\sim5-11$.
However, this agreement is only possible by reducing the star formation
threshold relative to that suggested by local observations. Otherwise, too much
star-forming gas is trapped in quenched dwarf galaxies. We further find that
dwarf galaxies rapidly build up their star-forming reservoirs in the early
universe ($z>10$), with the relevant time-scale becoming significantly longer
towards lower redshifts. This indicates efficient accretion in cold mode in
these low-mass objects at high redshift. Note that the improved SAM, which has

elementary summation and transformation results. Then the $q$-hypergeometric
difference equation is studied, and in particular we study solutions given in
terms of power series at $0$ and at $\infty$. Factorisations of the
corresponding operator are considered in terms of a lowering operator, which is
the $q$-derivative, and the related raising operator. Next we consider the
$q$-hypergeometric operator in a special case, and we show that there is a
natural Hilbert space --a weighted sequence space-- on which this operator is
symmetric. Then the corresponding eigenfunctions are polynomials, which are the
little $q$-Jacobi polynomials. These polynomials form a family in the $q$-Askey
scheme, and so many important properties are well known. In particular, we show
how the orthogonality relations and the three-term recurrence for the little
$q$-Jacobi polynomials can be obtained using only the factorisation of the
corresponding operator. As a next step we consider the $q$-hypergeometric
operator in general, which leads to the little $q$-Jacobi functions. We sketch
the derivation of the corresponding orthogonality using the connection between
various eigenfunctions. The link between the $q$-hypergeometric operators with
different parameters is studied in general using $q$-analogues of fractional
derivatives, and this gives transmutation properties for this operator. In the
final parts of these notes we consider partial extensions of this approach to
orthogonal polynomials and special functions. The first extension is a brief
introduction to the Askey-Wilson functions and the corresponding integral
transform. The second extension is concerned with a matrix-valued extension of
the $q$-hypergeometric difference equation and its solutions.

conjecture is required in many subjects and we shall give such examples of
relevant references. In this paper, we recall our interpretation of Vandiver's
conjecture in terms of minus part of the torsion of the Galois group of the
maximal abelian p-ramified pro-p-extension of the pth cyclotomic field (1984).
Then we provide a specific use of Gauss sums of characters of order p of
F\_ell^x and prove new criteria for Vandiver's conjecture to hold (Theorem
1.2(a) using both the sets of exponents of p-irregularity and of p-primarity of
suitable twists of the Gauss sums, and Theorem 1.2(b) which does not need the
knowledge of Bernoulli numbers or cyclotomic units). We propose in \S5.2 new
heuristics showing that any counterexample to the conjecture leads to excessive
constraints modulo p on the above twists as ell varies and suggests analytical
approaches to evidence. We perform numerical experiments to strengthen our
arguments in direction of the very probable truth of Vandiver's conjecture. All
the calculations are given with their PARI/GP programs.

frameworks (COFs) are proven to possess remarkable electronic and magnetic
properties. However, their mechanical behaviours remain almost unexplored. In
this work, taking the recently synthesised dimethylmethylene-bridged
triphenylamine (DTPA) sheet as an example, we investigate the mechanical
behaviours of 2D COFs based on molecular dynamics simulations together with
density functional theory calculations. A novel phase transformation is
observed in DTPA sheets when a relatively large in-plane compressive strain is
applied to them. Specifically, the crystal structures of the transformed phases
are topographically different when the compressive loading is applied in
different directions. The compression-induced phase transformation in DTPA
sheets is attributed to the buckling of their kagome lattice structures and is
found to have significant impacts on their material properties. After the phase
transformation, Young's modulus, band gap and thermal conductivity of DTPA
sheets are greatly reduced and become strongly anisotropic. Moreover, a large
in-plane negative Poisson's ratio is found in the transformed phases of DTPA
sheets. It is expected that the results of the compression-induced phase
transformation and its influence on the material properties observed in the
present DTPA sheets can be further extended to other 2D COFs, since most 2D
COFs possess a similar kagome lattice structure.

metallicities, and reddenings of the two GCs using the isochrone fitting on

Most of the existing attention based AU detection works use prior knowledge to
predefine fixed attentions or refine the predefined attentions within a small
range, which limits their capacity to model various AUs. In this paper, we
propose an end-to-end deep learning based attention and relation learning
framework for AU detection with only AU labels, which has not been explored
before. In particular, multi-scale features shared by each AU are learned
firstly, and then both channel-wise and spatial attentions are adaptively
learned to select and extract AU-related local features. Moreover, pixel-level
relations for AUs are further captured to refine spatial attentions so as to
extract more relevant local features. Without changing the network
architecture, our framework can be easily extended for AU intensity estimation.
Extensive experiments show that our framework (i) soundly outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods for both AU detection and AU intensity estimation on
the challenging BP4D, DISFA, FERA 2015 and BP4D+ benchmarks, (ii) can
adaptively capture the correlated regions of each AU, and (iii) also works well

gradients of line-of-sight velocities appear to be randomly oriented relative
to the plane-of-sky magnetic fields. Our simulations suggest that this random
alignment implies parallel or random alignment between the velocity gradients
and magnetic fields in the three dimensional space. The linewidths of H13CN
emission are consistently wider than those of H13CO+ emission in the 3''-10''

envelopes of low- and intermediate-mass stars ejected at late evolutionary
stages. The strong UV flux from their central stars causes a highly stratified
ionization structure, with species of higher ionization potential closer to the
star. Here we report on the exceptional case of HuBi 1, a double-shell
planetary nebula whose inner shell presents emission from low-ionization
species close to the star and emission from high-ionization species farther
away. Spectral analysis demonstrates that the inner shell of HuBi 1 is excited
by shocks, whereas its outer shell is recombining. The anomalous excitation of
these shells can be traced to its low-temperature [WC10] central star whose
optical brightness has declined continuously by 10 magnitudes in a period of 46
years. Evolutionary models reveal that this star is the descendent of a
low-mass star ($\simeq$1.1 $M_\odot$) that has experienced a born-again event
whose ejecta shock-excite the inner shell. HuBi 1 represents the missing link
in the formation of metal-rich central stars of planetary nebulae from low-mass
progenitors, offering unique insight regarding the future evolution of the
born-again Sakurai's object. Coming from a solar-mass progenitor, HuBi 1
represents a potential end-state for our Sun.

affine with respect to the short rate and the adjustment factor. Although the

traditional Hull-White model after fitting the yield curve. In addition, we
extend the model and the results to a multifactor version, driven by multiple

NLP problem that is best modeled as Textual Entailment. However, given a large
collection of text, finding evidence that could support or refute a given claim
is a challenge in itself, amplified by the fact that different evidence might
be needed to support or refute a claim. Nevertheless, most prior work decouples
evidence identification from determining the truth value of the claim given the
evidence.
  We propose to consider these two aspects jointly. We develop TwoWingOS
(two-wing optimization strategy), a system that, while identifying appropriate
evidence for a claim, also determines whether or not the claim is supported by
the evidence. Given the claim, TwoWingOS attempts to identify a subset of the
evidence candidates; given the predicted evidence, it then attempts to
determine the truth value of the corresponding claim. We treat this challenge
as coupled optimization problems, training a joint model for it. TwoWingOS
offers two advantages: (i) Unlike pipeline systems, it facilitates
flexible-size evidence set, and (ii) Joint training improves both the claim
entailment and the evidence identification. Experiments on a benchmark dataset
show state-of-the-art performance. Code: https://github.com/yinwenpeng/FEVER

and gas. The details of this mass-loss process are still not understood very
well. Herschel PACS and SPIRE spectra offer a unique way of investigating
properties of AGB stars in general and the mass-loss process in particular.
Methods: The HIPE software with the latest calibration is used to process the
available PACS and SPIRE spectra of 40 evolved stars. The spectra are convolved
with the response curves of the PACS and SPIRE bolometers and compared to the
fluxes measured in imaging data of these sources. Custom software is used to
identify lines in the spectra, and to determine the central wavelengths and
line intensities. Standard molecular line databases are used to associate the
observed lines. Because of the limited spectral resolution of the spectrometers
several known lines are typically potential counterparts to any observed line.
To help identifications the relative contributions in line intensity of the
potential counterpart lines are listed for three characteristic temperatures
based on LTE calculations and assuming optically thin emission. Result: The
following data products are released: the reduced spectra, the lines that are
measured in the spectra with wavelength, intensity, potential identifications,
and the continuum spectra, i.e. the full spectra with all identified lines
removed. As simple examples of how this data can be used in future studies we
have fitted the continuum spectra with three power laws and find that the few
OH/IR stars seem to have significantly steeper slopes than the other oxygen-
and carbon-rich objects in the sample. As another example we constructed
rotational diagrams for CO and fitted a two-component model to derive

In this study, to address this issue, we investigated the dynein-mediated

fluctuation theorem of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to estimate forces
acting on melanosomes during transport by dynein, given that the energy of a
system is related to its fluctuation. Our results demonstrate that multiple
force-producing units cooperatively transport a single melanosome. Since the
force is generated by dynein, this suggests that multiple dyneins carry a
single melanosome. Cooperative transport has been reported for other
organelles; thus, multiple-motor transport may be a universal mechanism for
moving organelles within the cell.

temperature and specific heat are derived using the first law of black holes
thermodynamics. Gibbs free energy is also evaluated. The behaviors of these
quantities show that, the quantum effects represented by the parameter $\beta$
induces a decreasing of the Hawking temperature of the black hole, and that
decrease is accentuated when increasing the magnitude of $\beta$ and the
normalization factor $a$ related to the density of quintessence. For the lower
entropies, the black hole passes from the unstable phase to the stable one by a
first order thermodynamics phase transition. When increasing the entropy, a
second phase transition occurs. This new phase transition is a second-order
thermodynamics phase transition and brings the black hole to unstable state. It
results that, when increasing of magnitude of $\beta$, the phase transition
points are shifted to the higher entropies. Moreover, the phenomena of phase
transitions are preserved by adding the quintessence. Furthermore, when
increasing the normalization factor of quintessence, the first order transition
point is shifted to higher entropies, while the second-order thermodynamics
phase transition point is shifted to lower entropies.

coronal loops have led to heightened interest over the last few years. The
modification of the Transverse Density Profile (TDP) of oscillating coronal
loops by non-linear effects, in particular the Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability
(KHI), is investigated. How this evolution may be detected is established, in
particular, when the KHI vortices may not be observed directly. A model for the
loop's TDP is used which includes a finite inhomogeneous layer and homogeneous
core, with a linear transition between them. The evolution of the loop's
transverse intensity profile from numerical simulations of kink oscillations is
analysed. Bayesian inference and forward modelling techniques are applied to
infer the evolution of the TDP from the intensity profiles, in a manner which
may be applied to observations. The strongest observational evidence for the
development of the KHI is found to be a widening of the loop's inhomogeneous
layer, which may be inferred for sufficiently well resolved loops, i.e $>$ 15
data points across the loop. The main signatures when observing the core of the
loop (for this specific loop model) during the oscillation are: a widening
inhomogeneous layer, decreasing intensity, an unchanged radius, and visible
fine transverse structuring when the resolution is sufficient. The appearance
of these signatures are delayed for loops with wider inhomogeneous layers, and
quicker for loops oscillating at higher amplitudes. These cases should also
result in stronger observational signatures, with visible transverse
structuring appearing for wide loops observed at SDO/AIA resolution.

  machine learning based models",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The widespread utilisation of grid-integrated wind electricity necessitates
accurate and reliable wind speed forecasting to ensure stable grid and quality
power. Machine learning algorithm based wind speed forecasting models are
getting increased attention in the literature owing to its superior ability to
learn by effectively capturing the changing patterns from the data. Most of the
reported wind forecasting models built on machine learning algorithms are
location specific and tested against data adjacent to the training data. In
this work, we develop the machine learning based wind speed forecasting models
and analyse their performance when applied to data from different cross-
locations up to a year ahead. Two distinct machine learning models based on
Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms have been
developed and tested separately for a relatively large geographical area. The
results of analysis of 1-hour forecasts obtained at various cross-locations and
points of time up to a year ahead show 80% of predictions within a Root Mean
Square Error (RMSE) of 1.5 m/s, 95% within 2.5 m/s and 98% within an RMSEof 3.5
m/s. The 75% of 2-hour predictions are within RMSE of 1.5 m/s, 16-hour
predictions within RMSE of 2.5 m / s and 48-hour predictions within RMSE of 3.5
m/s. When applied to thesame location of training data, the models generate
reliable forecasts for periods up to 22 hours, with the added advantage that
the models perform consistently throughout the year ahead horizon, independent
of the lead time from the training data. The output of the analysis is highly
promising to the wind energy industry in wind forecasting for locations where
historical wind speed data are not available for model building and training.

indicator by the market for trading and fifinancing purposes. A yield curve
plots interest rates across different contract maturities from short end to as
long as 30 years. For each currency, the corresponding curve shows the relation
between the level of the interest rates (or cost of borrowing) and the time to
maturity. For example, the U.S. dollar interest rates paid on U.S. Treasury
securities for various maturities are plotted as the US treasury curve. For the
same currency, if the swap market is used, we could also plot the swap rates
across the tenors which would be called the swap curve.Even the yield curve can
be at, upward or downward (inverted), however, yield curve is generally
concave. There is a lack of explanation of the concavity of the yield curve
shape from economics theory. We offer in this article an explanation of the
concavity shape of the yield curve from trading perspectives.

  Cryptocurrencies",,,,,"cs.CR econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Price stability has often been cited as a key reason that cryptocurrencies
have not gained widespread adoption as a medium of exchange and continue to
prove incapable of powering the economy of decentralized applications (DApps)
efficiently. Exeum proposes a novel method to provide price stable digital
tokens whose values are pegged to real world assets, serving as a bridge
between the real world and the decentralized economy.
  Pegged tokens issued by Exeum - for example, USDE refers to a stable token
issued by the system whose value is pegged to USD - are backed by virtual
assets in a virtual asset exchange where users can deposit the base token of
the system and take long or short positions. Guaranteeing the stability of the
pegged tokens boils down to the problem of maintaining the peg of the virtual
assets to real world assets, and the main mechanism used by Exeum is
controlling the swap rate of assets. If the swap rate is fully controlled by
the system, arbitrageurs can be incentivized enough to restore a broken peg;
Exeum distributes statistical arbitrage trading software to decentralize this
type of market making activity. The last major component of the system is a
central bank equivalent that determines the long term interest rate of the base
token, pays interest on the deposit by inflating the supply if necessary, and
removes the need for stability fees on pegged tokens, improving their
usability.
  To the best of our knowledge, Exeum is the first to propose a truly
decentralized method for developing a stablecoin that enables 1:1 value
conversion between the base token and pegged assets, completely removing the
mismatch between supply and demand. In this paper, we will also discuss its
applications, such as improving staking based DApp token models, price stable
gas fees, pegging to an index of DApp tokens, and performing cross-chain asset
transfer of legacy crypto assets.

have population dynamics and simple rules for species migrations, has also been
studied. It turns out that they do not show an SOC state although the
assumptions made in these models are similar to those in the BS model. To
clarify the origin of these differences and to identify a key ingredient of
SOC, we study models that bridge the BS model and the Dynamical Graph model,
which is a representative of the population dynamics models. From a comparative
study of the models, we find that SOC is found when the fluctuations of the
number of species $N$ are suppressed, while it shows off-critical states when
$N$ changes according to its evolutionary dynamics. This indicates that the
assumption of the fixed system size in the BS model plays a pivotal role to
drive the system into an SOC state, and casts doubt on its applicability to
actual evolutionary dynamics.

review in the UK Research Excellence Framework (REF) was found. However,
earlier studies observed much higher agreement between metrics and peer review
in the REF and argued in favour of using metrics. This shows that there is
considerable ambiguity in the discussion on agreement between metrics and peer
review. We provide clarity in this discussion by considering four important
points: (1) the level of aggregation of the analysis; (2) the use of either a
size-dependent or a size-independent perspective; (3) the suitability of
different measures of agreement; and (4) the uncertainty in peer review. In the
context of the REF, we argue that agreement between metrics and peer review
should be assessed at the institutional level rather than at the publication
level. Both a size-dependent and a size-independent perspective are relevant in
the REF. The interpretation of correlations may be problematic and as an
alternative we therefore use measures of agreement that are based on the
absolute or relative differences between metrics and peer review. To get an
idea of the uncertainty in peer review, we rely on a model to bootstrap peer
review outcomes. We conclude that particularly in Physics, Clinical Medicine,
and Public Health, metrics agree quite well with peer review and may offer an
alternative to peer review.

approximation using a cascade of models such as trees. In particular, we look
at the problem of covariance matrix approximation for Gaussian distributions as
linear transformations of tree models. This is a new way to decompose the
covariance matrix. Here, we propose an algorithm which incorporates the
Cholesky factorization method to compute the decomposition matrix and thus can
approximate a simple graphical model using a cascade of the Cholesky
factorization of the tree approximation transformations. The Cholesky
decomposition enables us to achieve a tree structure factor graph at each
cascade stage of the algorithm which facilitates the use of the message passing
algorithm since the approximated graph has less loops compared to the original
graph. The overall graph is a cascade of factor graphs with each factor graph
being a tree. This is a different perspective on the approximation model, and
algorithms such as Gaussian belief propagation can be used on this overall
graph. Here, we present theoretical result that guarantees the convergence of
the proposed model approximation using the cascade of tree decompositions. In
the simulations, we look at synthetic and real data and measure the performance
of the proposed framework by comparing the KL divergences.

essential to measure and help achieving these improvements in healthcare
delivery. Consequently, a data influx from various clinical, financial and
operational sources is now overtaking healthcare organizations and their
patients. The effective use of this data, however, is a major challenge.
Clearly, text is an important medium to make data accessible. Financial reports
are produced to assess healthcare organizations on some key performance
indicators to steer their healthcare delivery. Similarly, at a clinical level,
data on patient status is conveyed by means of textual descriptions to
facilitate patient review, shift handover and care transitions. Likewise,
patients are informed about data on their health status and treatments via
text, in the form of reports or via ehealth platforms by their doctors.
Unfortunately, such text is the outcome of a highly labour-intensive process if
it is done by healthcare professionals. It is also prone to incompleteness,
subjectivity and hard to scale up to different domains, wider audiences and
varying communication purposes. Data-to-text is a recent breakthrough
technology in artificial intelligence which automatically generates natural
language in the form of text or speech from data. This chapter provides a
survey of data-to-text technology, with a focus on how it can be deployed in a
healthcare setting. It will (1) give an up-to-date synthesis of data-to-text

of magnitude less numerous than other patterns present in the dataset. This
applies both to the case of supervised detection, where the known template is
expected to match in just a few areas and unsupervised anomaly detection, as
anomalies are rare by definition. This problem is frequently related to the
imaging applications, i.e. detection within the scene acquired by a camera. To
maximize available data about the scene, hyperspectral cameras are used; at
each pixel, they record spectral data in hundreds of narrow bands.
  The typical feature of hyperspectral imaging is that characteristic
properties of target materials are visible in the small number of bands, where
light of certain wavelength interacts with characteristic molecules. A
target-independent band selection method based on statistical principles is a
versatile tool for solving this problem in different practical applications.
  Combination of a regular background and a rare standing out anomaly will
produce a distortion in the joint distribution of hyperspectral pixels. Higher
Order Cumulants Tensors are a natural `window' into this distribution, allowing
to measure properties and suggest candidate bands for removal. While there have
been attempts at producing band selection algorithms based on the 3 rd
cumulant's tensor i.e. the joint skewness, the literature lacks a systematic
analysis of how the order of the cumulant tensor used affects effectiveness of
band selection in detection applications. In this paper we present an analysis
of a general algorithm for band selection based on higher order cumulants. We
discuss its usability related to the observed breaking points in performance,
depending both on method order and the desired number of bands. Finally we
perform experiments and evaluate these methods in a hyperspectral detection
scenario.

Systems (INS) are emerging as a popular complementary system, especially in
road transportation systems as they enable improved navigation and tracking as

this paper, we evaluate the security guarantees of INS-aided GPS tracking and
navigation for road transportation systems. We consider an adversary required
to travel from a source location to a destination, and monitored by a INS-aided
GPS system. The goal of the adversary is to travel to alternate locations
without being detected. We developed and evaluated algorithms that achieve such
goal, providing the adversary significant latitude. Our algorithms build a

INS-aided GPS tracking and navigation system. The algorithms render the
gyroscope and accelerometer sensors useless as they generate road trajectories
indistinguishable from plausible paths (both in terms of turn angles and roads
curvature). We also designed, built, and demonstrated that the magnetometer can
be actively spoofed using a combination of carefully controlled coils. We
implemented and evaluated the impact of the attack using both real-world and
simulated driving traces in more than 10 cities located around the world. Our
evaluations show that it is possible for an attacker to reach destinations that
are as far as 30 km away from the true destination without being detected. We

complete level of detail which previously has only been reached for single
photon double ionization. We give an overview over the observables on many
levels of integration, starting from the ratio of double to single ionization,
the individual electron and ion momentum distributions over joint momentum and
energy distributions to fully differential cross sections showing the
correlated angular momentum distributions. Within the studied intensity range
the ratio of double to single ionization changes from $2\times 10^{-4}$ to
$1.5\times 10^{-3}$. We find the momentum distributions of the $\rm{He}^{2+}$
ions and the correlated two electron momentum distributions to vary
substantially. Only at the highest intensity both electrons are emitted to the
same direction while at the lowest intensity back-to-back emission dominates.
The joint energy distribution of the electrons shows discrete structures from
the energy quantization of the photon field which allows us to count the number
of absorbed photons and thus access the parity of the final state. We find the
energy of the individual electron to show a peak structure indicating a
quantized sharing of the overall energy absorbed from the field. The joint
angular momentum distributions of the two electrons show a highly directed
emission of both electrons along the polarization axis as well as clear
imprints of electron repulsion. They strongly change with the energy sharing
between the electrons. The aspect of selection rules in double ionization which
are also visible in the presented dataset has been subject to a preceding

systems provides a window into uncertain processes in stellar evolution,
especially mixing at convective boundaries. Recently, these data have been used
to calibrate models of convective overshooting in the cores of main sequence
stars. In this study we have used a small representative sample of eclipsing
binary stars with $1.25 \leq M/\text{M}_\odot < 4.2$ to test how precisely this
method can constrain the overshooting and whether the data support a universal
stellar mass--overshooting relation. We do not recover the previously reported
stellar mass dependence for the extent of overshooting and in each case we find
there is a substantial amount of uncertainty, that is, the same binary pair can
be matched by models with different amounts of overshooting. Models with a
moderate overshooting parameter $0.013 \leq f_\text{os} \leq 0.014$ (using the
scheme from Herwig et al. 1997) are consistent with all eight systems studied.
Generally, a much larger range of $f_\text{os}$ is suitable for individual
systems. In the case of main sequence and early post-main sequence stars, large
changes in the amount of overshooting have little effect on the radius and
effective temperature, and therefore the method is of extremely limited
utility.

metal-insulator transitions (MIT) in strongly-correlated materials is one of
the main longstanding problems in condensed matter physics. An archetypal
example is V2O3, where electronic, structural and magnetic phase transitions
occur simultaneously. This remarkable concomitance makes the understanding of
the origin of the MIT a challenge due to the many degrees of freedom at play.
In this work, we demonstrate that magnetism plays the key dominant role. By
acting on the magnetic degree of freedom, we reveal an anomalous behaviour of
the magnetoresistance of V2O3, which provides strong evidence that the origin
of the MIT in V2O3 is the opening of an antiferromagnetic gap in the presence
of strong electronic correlations.

obtained by letting the convolution kernel converge to the Dirac delta one
formally recovers a conservation law. However, recent counter-examples show
that in general the solutions of the nonlocal equations do not converge to a
solution of the conservation law. In this work we focus on nonlocal
conservation laws modeling vehicular traffic: in this case, the convolution
kernel is anisotropic. We show that, under fairly general assumptions on the
(anisotropic) convolution kernel, the nonlocal-to-local limit can be rigorously
justified provided the initial datum satisfies a one-sided Lipschitz condition
and is bounded away from $0$. We also exhibit a counter-example showing that,
if the initial datum attains the value $0$, then there are severe obstructions
to a convergence proof.

ray interactions with Galactic gas and radiation fields. Thus, neutrinos are a
unique messenger offering the opportunity to test the products of Galactic
cosmic ray interactions up to energies of hundreds of TeV. Here we present a
search for this production using ten years of ANTARES track and shower data, as
well as seven years of IceCube track data. The data are combined into a joint
likelihood test for neutrino emission according to the KRA$_\gamma$ model
assuming a 5 PeV per nucleon Galactic cosmic ray cutoff. No significant excess
is found. As a consequence, the limits presented in this work start
constraining the model parameter space for Galactic cosmic ray production and
transport.

arbitrary family of spatial modes, such as mutually unbiased bases,
Hermite-Gauss, and Ince-Gauss. Our scheme will significantly enhance existing

significant effects of lateral layer size as well as layer number in the

the energy gap disappears and the Fermi level shifts towards valence band. In
the case of bilayer MoS$_{2}$ on bilayer Gr structure, the Fermi level shift is

understood in terms of the axioms of adaptivity. One key ingredient is the
discrete reliability of a residual-based a posteriori error estimator, which
controls the error of two discrete finite element solutions based on two nested
triangulations. In the error analysis of nonconforming finite element methods,
like the Crouzeix-Raviart or Morley finite element schemes, the difference of
the piecewise derivatives of discontinuous approximations to the distributional
gradients of global Sobolev functions plays a dominant role and is the object
of this paper. The nonconforming interpolation operator, which comes natural
with the definition of the aforementioned nonconforming finite element in the
sense of Ciarlet, allows for stability and approximation properties that enable
direct proofs of the reliability for the residual that monitors the equilibrium
condition. The novel approach of this paper is the suggestion of a
right-inverse of this interpolation operator in conforming piecewise

approximation on a refined triangulation. The results of this paper allow for
simple proofs of the discrete reliability in any space dimension and multiply

and their structural characterization is the major focus of current

employ the steered molecular dynamics to assess the strength of protein-peptide
interactions. The idea behind using steered molecular dynamics simulations is
that the mechanical stability can be used as a promising and an efficient
alternative to computationally highly demanding estimation of binding affinity.
However, mechanical stability defined as a peak in force-extension profile
depends on the choice of the pulling direction. Here we propose an uncommon
choice of the pulling direction along resultant dipole moment vector, which has
not been explored in simulations so far. Using explicit solvent all-atom MD
simulations, we apply steered molecular dynamics technique to probe mechanical
resistance of protein-peptide system pulled along two different vectors. A
novel pulling direction, along the resultant dipole moment vector, results in
stronger forces compared to commonly used peptide unbinding along center of
masses vector. Our results demonstrate that resultant dipole moment is one of
the factors influencing the mechanical stability of protein-peptide complex.

  submitted for publication",,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Testing for white noise is a classical yet important problem in statistics,
especially for diagnostic checks in time series modeling and linear regression.
For high-dimensional time series in the sense that the dimension $p$ is large
in relation to the sample size $T$, the popular omnibus tests including the
multivariate Hosking and Li-McLeod tests are extremely conservative, leading to
substantial power loss. To develop more relevant tests for high-dimensional
cases, we propose a portmanteau-type test statistic which is the sum of squared
singular values of the first $q$ lagged sample autocovariance matrices. It,
therefore, encapsulates all the serial correlations (upto the time lag $q$)
within and across all component series. Using the tools from random matrix
theory and assuming both $p$ and $T$ diverge to infinity, we derive the
asymptotic normality of the test statistic under both the null and a specific
VMA(1) alternative hypothesis. As the actual implementation of the test
requires the knowledge of three characteristic constants of the population
cross-sectional covariance matrix and the value of the fourth moment of the
standardized innovations, non trivial estimations are proposed for these
parameters and their integration leads to a practically usable test. Extensive
simulation confirms the excellent finite-sample performance of the new test
with accurate size and satisfactory power for a large range of finite $(p,T)$
combinations, therefore ensuring wide applicability in practice. In particular,
the new tests are consistently superior to the traditional Hosking and
Li-McLeod tests.

tiny and highly mobile electron band for all the samples studied. Sulfur
substitution in the studied range leads to a decrease in the number of mobile

may indicate a successive change of the Fermi level position relative to
singular points of the electronic structure which is consistent with the `doped

impurities, which allows us to consider this group as a possible source of
unusual acoustic properties of FeSe.

materials that combine highly controllable optical and electrical properties
with mechanical flexibility and remarkable strength. Like other thin sheets,
their low bending rigidity allows them to easily roll into or conform to
cylindrical geometries. Nanoparticle monolayers not only can bend, but also
cope with strain through local particle rearrangement and plastic deformation.
This means that, unlike thin sheets such as paper or graphene, nanoparticle
sheets can much more easily conform to surfaces with complex topography
characterized by non-zero Gaussian curvature, like spherical caps or saddles.
Here, we investigate the limits of nanoparticle monolayers' ability to conform
to substrates with Gaussian curvature by stamping nanoparticle sheets onto
lattices of larger polystyrene spheres. Tuning the local Gaussian curvature by
increasing the size of the substrate spheres, we find that the stamped sheet
morphology evolves through three characteristic stages: from full substrate
coverage, where the sheet extends over the interstices in the lattice, to
coverage in the form of caps that conform tightly to the top portion of each
sphere and fracture at larger polar angles, to caps that exhibit radial folds.
Through analysis of the nanoparticle positions, obtained from scanning electron
micrographs, we extract the local strain tensor and track the onset of
strain-induced dislocations in the particle arrangement. By considering the
interplay of energies for elastic and plastic deformations and adhesion, we
construct arguments that capture the observed changes in sheet morphology as
Gaussian curvature is tuned over two orders of magnitude.

necessary in the 65 and 90 micron bands. We then use these corrected fluxes to
supplement existing data in spectral energy distribution (SED) fits for
ultraluminous infrared galaxies in the HERUS survey. The addition of AKARI
fluxes makes little difference to the results of simple (T,beta) fits to the
SEDs of these sources, though there is a general decrease in reduced chi^2
values. The utility of the extra AKARI data, however, is in allowing physically
more realistic SED models with more parameters to be fit to the data. We also
extend our analysis of beam correction issues in the AKARI data by examining
the Herschel Reference Sample, which have Herschel photometry from 100 to 500
microns and which are more spatially extended than the HERUS ULIRGs.
Thirty-four of the HRS sources have good Herschel SEDs and matching data from
AKARI. This investigation finds that our simple 2MASS-based beam correction
scheme is inadequate for these larger and more complex sources. There are also
indications that additional beam corrections at 140 and 160 microns are needed
for these sources, extended on scales >1 arcminute.

reconstructs the image. The non-linear nature of the processing makes
optimizing the illumination pattern designs complicated. Traditional techniques
for experimental design (e.g. condition number optimization, spectral analysis)
consider only linear measurement formation models and linear reconstructions.
Deep neural networks (DNNs) can efficiently represent the non-linear process
and can be optimized over via training in an end-to-end framework. However,
DNNs typically require a large amount of training examples and parameters to
properly learn the phase retrieval process, without making use of the known
physical models. Here, we aim to use both our knowledge of the physics and the
power of machine learning together. We develop a new data-driven approach to
optimizing coded-illumination patterns for a LED array microscope for a given
phase reconstruction algorithm. Our method incorporates both the physics of the
measurement scheme and the non-linearity of the reconstruction algorithm into
the design problem. This enables efficient parameterization, which allows us to
use only a small number of training examples to learn designs that generalize
well in the experimental setting without retraining. We show experimental
results for both a well-characterized phase target and mouse fibroblast cells

reconstruction algorithm. Our learned design results using 2 measurements
demonstrate similar accuracy to Fourier Ptychography with 69 measurements.

obtained a single con-temporary spectrum with FAST at Mt. Hopkins. Compared to
earlier epochs 3C 120 is about a factor of three brighter, allowing us to study
the shape of the broad line region (BLR) and the dust torus in a high
luminosity phase. The analysis of the light curves yields that the dust echo is
rather sharp and symmetric in contrast to the more complex broad H alpha BLR
echo. We investigate how far this supports an optically thick bowl-shaped BLR
and dust torus geometry as proposed by Kawaguchi & Mori (2010) and Goad et al.
(2012). The comparison with several parameterizations of these models supports
the following geometry: the BLR clouds lie inside the bowl closely above the
bowl rim, up to a half covering angle 0 deg < theta < 40 deg (measured against
the equatorial plane). Then the BLR is spread over many isodelay surfaces,
yielding a smeared and structured echo as observed. Furthermore, if the BLR
clouds shield the bottom of the bowl rim against radiation from the nucleus,
the hot dust emission comes essentially from the top edge of the bowl (40 deg <
theta < 45 deg). Then, for small inclinations as for 3C120, the top dust edge
forms a ring which largely coincides with a narrow range of isodelay surfaces,
yielding the observed sharp dust echo. The scale height of the BLR increases
with radial distance from the black hole. This leads to luminosity dependent
foreshortening effects of the lag. We discuss implications and possible
corrections of the foreshortening for the black hole mass determination and
consequences for the lag (size) - luminosity relationships and the difference
to interferometric torus sizes.

solved by means of the adaptations of existing level-set algorithms for

of benchmark tasks in text, speech and image processing. Nonlinear parameter
estimation in hierarchical models is known to be subject to overfitting and
misspecification. One approach to these estimation and related problems (local
minima, colinearity, feature discovery etc.) is called Dropout (Hinton, et al
2012, Baldi et al 2016). The Dropout algorithm removes hidden units according
to a Bernoulli random variable with probability $p$ prior to each update,
creating random ""shocks"" to the network that are averaged over updates. In this
paper we will show that Dropout is a special case of a more general model
published originally in 1990 called the Stochastic Delta Rule, or SDR (Hanson,
1990). SDR redefines each weight in the network as a random variable with mean
$\mu_{w_{ij}}$ and standard deviation $\sigma_{w_{ij}}$. Each weight random
variable is sampled on each forward activation, consequently creating an
exponential number of potential networks with shared weights. Both parameters
are updated according to prediction error, thus resulting in weight noise
injections that reflect a local history of prediction error and local model
averaging. SDR therefore implements a more sensitive local gradient-dependent
simulated annealing per weight converging in the limit to a Bayes optimal
network. Tests on standard benchmarks (CIFAR) using a modified version of
DenseNet shows the SDR outperforms standard Dropout in test error by approx.
$17\%$ with DenseNet-BC 250 on CIFAR-100 and approx. $12-14\%$ in smaller
networks. We also show that SDR reaches the same accuracy that Dropout attains

energy bins [4,8] EeV and $E\geq 8$ EeV, the most significant signal is a
dipolar modulation in right ascension at energies above 8 EeV, as previously
reported. In this paper we further scrutinize the highest-energy bin by
splitting it into three energy ranges. We find that the amplitude of the dipole
increases with energy above 4 EeV. The growth can be fitted with a power law
with index $\beta=0.79\pm 0.19$. The directions of the dipoles are consistent
with an extragalactic origin of these anisotropies at all the energies
considered. Additionally we have estimated the quadrupolar components of the
anisotropy: they are not statistically significant. We discuss the results in
the context of the predictions from different models for the distribution of
ultrahigh-energy sources and cosmic magnetic fields.

  quadratic regulation",,,"10.1016/j.automatica.2019.04.017",,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The constrained linear quadratic regulation problem is solved by a continuous
piecewise affine function on a set of state space polytopes. It is an obvious
question whether this solution can be built up iteratively by increasing the
horizon, i.e., by extending the classical backward dynamic programming solution
for the unconstrained case to the constrained case. Unfortunately, however, the
piecewise affine solution for horizon N is in general not contained in the
piecewise affine law for horizon N + 1. We show that a backward dynamic
programming does, in contrast, result in a useful structure for the set of the
active sets that defines the solution. Essentially, every active set for the
problem with horizon N + 1 results from extending an active set for horizon N ,
if the constraints are ordered stage by stage. Consequently, the set for
horizon N + 1 can be found by only considering the constraints of the
additional stage. Furthermore, it is easy to detect which polytopes and affine
pieces are invariant to increasing the horizon, and therefore persist in the
limit N to infinity. Several other aspects of the structure of the set of
active sets become evident if the active sets are represented by bit tuples.
There exists, for example, a subset of special active sets that generates a
positive invariant and persistent (i.e., horizon invariant) set around the
origin. It is very simple to identify these special active sets, and the
positive invariant and persistent region can be found without solving optimal
control or auxiliary optimization problems. The paper briefly discusses the use
of these results in model predictive control. Some opportunities for uses in
computational methods are also briefly summarized.

groups. We separately give an explicit algorithmic construction for
representatives of each orbit. We then, in the general setting of groups
$\mathrm{GL}_n(D)$, $\mathrm{SL}_n(D)$ (where $D$ is a central division algebra
over $k$) or classical groups, give a new characterisation of the ""building

There are many already existing algorithms. However, new seed-based algorithms

strategies is to identify exceptional nodes in the given network, called seeds,
around which communities can be located. This paper proposes a blended strategy
for locating suitable superior seed set by applying various centrality measures
and using them to find overlapping communities. The examination of the

However, due to the time step restrictions arising from the semi-implicit time
stepping for the incompressible case, the potential advantage of these methods
depends critically on efficient elliptic solvers. Due to the operation counts
of operators scaling with with the polynomial degree $p$ times the number of
degrees of freedom $n_{\mathrm{DOF}}$, the runtime of the best available
multigrid solvers scales with $\mathcal{O}( p \cdot n_{\mathrm{DOF}})$. This
scaling with $p$ significantly lowers the applicability of high-order methods
to high orders. While the operators for residual evaluation can be linearized
when using static condensation, Schwarz-type smoothers require their inverses
on fixed subdomains. No explicit inverse is known in the condensed case and
matrix-matrix multiplications scale with ${p \cdot n_{\mathrm{DOF}}}$. This
paper derives a matrix-free explicit inverse for the static condensed operator
in a cuboidal subdomain. It scales with $p^3$ per element, i.e.
${n_{\mathrm{DOF}}}$ globally, and allows for a linearly scaling additive
Schwarz smoother, yielding a $p$-multigrid cycle with an operation count of
$\mathcal{O}(n_{\mathrm{DOF}})$. The resulting solver uses fewer than four
iterations for all polynomial degrees to reduce the residual by ten orders and
has a runtime scaling linearly with ${n_{\mathrm{DOF}}}$ for polynomial degrees
at least up to $48$. Furthermore the runtime is less than one microsecond per
unknown over wide parameter ranges when using one core of a CPU, leading to
time-stepping for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using as much time
for explicitly treated convection terms as for the elliptic solvers.

However, it is well-known that adversaries are always trying to adapt their
attacks to evade detection. For example, an email spammer may guess what
features spam detection models use and modify or remove those features to avoid
detection. There has been some work on making machine learning models more
robust to such attacks. However, one simple but promising approach called {\em
randomization} is underexplored. This paper proposes a novel
randomization-based approach to improve robustness of machine learning models
against evasion attacks. The proposed approach incorporates randomization into
both model training time and model application time (meaning when the model is
used to detect attacks). We also apply this approach to random forest, an

intrusion detection and spam filtering data show that our approach further
improves robustness of random-forest method. We also discuss how this approach

  Conference 2018",,,,"math.PR cond-mat.stat-mech cs.NI math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we consider a stochastic model for a frequency-agile CSMA
protocol for wireless networks where multiple orthogonal frequency channels are
available. Even when the possible interference on the different channels is
described by different conflict graphs, we show that the network dynamics can
be equivalently described as that of a single-channel CSMA algorithm on an
appropriate virtual network. Our focus is on the asymptotic regime in which the
network nodes try to activate aggressively in order to achieve maximum
throughput. Of particular interest is the scenario where the number of
available channels is not sufficient for all nodes of the network to be
simultaneously active and the well-studied temporal starvation issues of the
single-channel CSMA dynamics persist. For most networks we expect that a larger
number of available channels should alleviate these temporal starvation issues.
However, we prove that the aggregate throughput is a non-increasing function of
the number of available channels. To investigate this trade-off that emerges
between aggregate throughput and temporal starvation phenomena, we propose an
analytical framework to study the transient dynamics of multi-channel CSMA
networks by means of first hitting times. Our analysis further reveals that the
mixing time of the activity process does not always correctly characterize the
temporal starvation in the multi-channel scenario and often leads to
pessimistic performance estimates.

linear groundwater flow model subject to tidal forcing, we show that under
certain conditions these flows generate Lagrangian transport and mixing
phenomena (chaotic advection) near the tidal boundary. We show that aquifer
heterogeneity, storativity, and forcing magnitude cause reversals in flow
direction over the forcing cycle which, in turn, generate coherent Lagrangian
structures and chaos. These features significantly augment fluid mixing and
transport, leading to anomalous residence time distributions, flow segregation,
and the potential for profoundly altered reaction kinetics. We define the
dimensionless parameter groups which govern this phenomenon and explore these
groups in connection with a set of well-characterised coastal systems. The
potential for Lagrangian chaos to be present near discharge boundaries must be

part of multi-domain proteins. In the study presented here, differences in the
properties of protein domains in single-domain and multi-domain systems and
their influence on functions are discussed. We studied 20 pairs of identical
protein domains, which were crystallized in two forms (a) tethered to other
proteins domains and (b) tethered to fewer protein domains than (a) or not
tethered to any protein domain. Results suggest that tethering of domains in
multi-domain proteins influences the structural, dynamic and energetic
properties of the constituent protein domains. 50% of the protein domain pairs
show significant structural deviations while 90% of the protein domain pairs
show differences in dynamics and 12% of the residues show differences in the
energetics. To gain further insights on the influence of tethering on the
function of the domains, 4 pairs of homologous protein domains, where one of
them is a full-length single-domain protein and the other protein domain is a
part of a multi-domain protein, were studied. Analyses showed that identical

its mechanical properties. Knowledge of this response is essential in designing
artificial tactile devices such as minimally invasive tools and tactile
displays. The purpose of present research is to simulate the biomechanics of
tactile sensation during indentation tests. A two-dimensional finite element
model has been used for the analysis incorporating the essential anatomical
structures of a finger (i.e., skin, subcutaneous tissue, bone, and nail). The
skin and subcutaneous tissue are assumed to be hyperelastic and viscoelastic.
We obtained the stress, strain and deformation fields in indentation tests. It
was noted that the skin away from the indenter was experiencing considerable
amount of strain energy density. Also, the response of SAI afferents could be
predicted from the proposed model. These results were in agreement with the
results mentioned in other published experimental data.

image-guided therapy for both clinical and research purposes. Since CT involves
ionizing radiation, an overarching thrust of related technical research is
development of novel methods enabling ultrahigh quality imaging with fine
structural details while reducing the X-ray radiation. In this paper, we
present a semi-supervised deep learning approach to accurately recover
high-resolution (HR) CT images from low-resolution (LR) counterparts.
Specifically, with the generative adversarial network (GAN) as the building
block, we enforce the cycle-consistency in terms of the Wasserstein distance to
establish a nonlinear end-to-end mapping from noisy LR input images to denoised
and deblurred HR outputs. We also include the joint constraints in the loss
function to facilitate structural preservation. In this deep imaging process,
we incorporate deep convolutional neural network (CNN), residual learning, and
network in network techniques for feature extraction and restoration. In
contrast to the current trend of increasing network depth and complexity to
boost the CT imaging performance, which limit its real-world applications by
imposing considerable computational and memory overheads, we apply a parallel
$1\times1$ CNN to compress the output of the hidden layer and optimize the
number of layers and the number of filters for each convolutional layer.
Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our proposed model is
accurate, efficient and robust for super-resolution (SR) image restoration from
noisy LR input images. In particular, we validate our composite SR networks on
three large-scale CT datasets, and obtain promising results as compared to the
other state-of-the-art methods.

the present work. We have studied the standard parameter degeneracies in

examine the mass hierarchy degeneracy assuming (i) all NSI parameters to be
non-zero and (ii) one NSI parameter($\epsilon_{e\mu}$) and its corresponding
$CP$ phase($\delta_{e\mu}$) to be non-zero. We find that the later case is more
appropriate to resolve mass hierarchy degeneracy with DUNE and T2HKK
experiments due to relatively small uncertainties emanating from the NSI
sector. We have, also, investigated the octant degeneracy with
neutrino($\nu_{\mu}\rightarrow\nu_{e}$) and
antineutrino($\bar{\nu}_{\mu}\rightarrow\bar{\nu}_{e}$) mode separately. We
find that to resolve this degeneracy the long baseline experiment with
combination of neutrino and antineutrino mode is essential. Furthermore, we
have considered DUNE in conjunction with T2HKK experiment to study $CP$ phase
degeneracy due to standard($\delta$) and non-standard($\delta_{e\mu}$) $CP$
phases. We find that DUNE and T2HKK, in conjunction, has more sensitivity for
$CP$ violation effects(10$\sigma$ for true NH and 8.2$\sigma$ for true IH).

exhibited excellent results on many classification tasks. However, they are
considered as black boxes and some of their properties remain to be formalized.
In the context of image recognition, it is still an arduous task to understand
why an image is recognized or not. In this study, we formalize some properties
shared by eight state-of-the-art deep neural networks in order to grasp the
principles allowing a given deep neural network to classify an image. Our
results, tested on these eight networks, show that an image can be sub-divided
into several regions (patches) responding at different degrees of probability
(local property). With the same patch, some locations in the image can answer
two (or three) orders of magnitude higher than other locations (spatial
property). Some locations are activators and others inhibitors
(activation-inhibition property). The repetition of the same patch can increase
(or decrease) the probability of recognition of an object (cumulative
property). Furthermore, we propose a new approach called Deepception that
exploits these properties to deceive a deep neural network. We obtain for the
VGG-VDD-19 neural network a fooling ratio of 88\%. Thanks to our
""Psychophysics"" approach, no prior knowledge on the networks architectures is
required.
