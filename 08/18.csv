thermally readjust during a Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF) phase and the final
binary system and its orbital period are investigated. We find that the post-CE
RLOF phase is long enough to allow nuclear burning to proceed in the helium
shell. By the end of this phase, the donor is stripped of both its hydrogen and
helium and ends up as carbon-oxygen white dwarf of mass about $0.8\,\rm

different companion masses and orbital separations at which the stripping phase
begins. We find that the companion mass affects the final binary separation and
that helium-shell burning causes the star to refill its Roche lobe leading to
post-CE RLOF. Our results show that double mass transfer in such a binary

use separable coding, i.e., coding independently and in parallel over different

memory requirements at both communication ends. In this paper a lattice coding
and decoding scheme is proposed that achieves the ergodic capacity without
separable coding, with lattice codebooks and decoding decision regions that are
universal across channel realizations. We first demonstrate this result for
fading distributions with discrete, finite support whose sequences are robustly
typical. Results are then extended to continuous fading distributions, as well
as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In addition, a variant of the
proposed scheme is presented for the MIMO ergodic fading channel with CSIR
only, where we prove the existence of a universal codebook that achieves rates
within a constant gap to capacity for finite-support fading distributions. The
gap is small compared with other schemes in the literature. Extension to
continuous-valued fading is also provided.

sketching -- a method of dimension reduction using random sampling, random

  To answer this question, we present a projector-based approach to sketched
linear regression that is exact and that requires minimal assumptions on the
sketching matrix. Therefore, downstream analyses hold exactly and generally for
all sketching schemes. Additionally, a projector-based approach enables
derivation of key quantities from classic linear regression that account for
the combined model- and algorithm-induced uncertainties. We demonstrate the
usefulness of a projector-based approach in quantifying and enabling insight on
excess uncertainties and bias-variance decompositions for sketched linear
regression. Finally, we demonstrate how the insights from our projector-based
analyses can be used to produce practical sketching diagnostics to aid the
design of judicious sketching schemes.

is, singular and nonsingular flat bands, by exploiting the singular behavior of
their Bloch wave functions in momentum space. In the case of a singular flat
band, its Bloch wave function possesses immovable discontinuities generated by
the band-crossing with other bands, and thus the vector bundle associated with
the flat band cannot be defined. This singularity precludes the compact
localized states from forming a complete set spanning the flat band. Once the
degeneracy at the band crossing point is lifted, the singular flat band becomes
dispersive and can acquire a finite Chern number in general, suggesting a new
route for obtaining a nearly flat Chern band. On the other hand, the Bloch wave
function of a nonsingular flat band has no singularity, and thus forms a vector
bundle. A nonsingular flat band can be completely isolated from other bands
while preserving the perfect flatness. All one-dimensional flat bands belong to
the nonsingular class. We show that a singular flat band displays a novel
bulk-boundary correspondence such that the presence of the robust boundary mode
is guaranteed by the singularity of the Bloch wave function. Moreover, we
develop a general scheme to construct a flat band model Hamiltonian in which
one can freely design its singular or nonsingular nature. Finally, we propose a
general formula for the compact localized state spanning the flat band, which
can be easily implemented in numerics and offer a basis set useful in analyzing
correlation effects in flat bands.

prerequisite for quenching a galaxy, leading to a proposed two-step quenching
scenario: compaction and quenching. In this scenario, galaxies first grow their
cores to a stellar mass surface density threshold and subsequently quenching
occurs, suggesting that galaxies evolve from extended star-forming galaxies
(eSFGs), through compact star-forming galaxies (cSFGs), to quenched population.
In this work, we aim at examining the possible evolutionary link between eSFGs
and cSFGs by identifying the trends in star formation rate (SFR), gas-phase
metallicity and HI content, since one would naturally expect that galaxies
evolve along the track of cold gas consumption and metal enhancement. We select
a volume-limited sample of 15,933 galaxies with stellar mass above
$10^{9.5}M_{\odot}$ and redshift of 0.02 < z < 0.05 from the NASA-Sloan-Atlas
catalog within the ALFALFA footprint. The cSFGs on average exhibit similar or
slightly higher SFRs of $\sim$0.06 dex and significantly higher gas-phase
metallicity (up to 0.2 dex at low mass) with respect to the eSFGs, while the
cSFGs dominate the galaxy population of the most intense star formation
activities. More importantly, overall the median HI content and gas depletion
time of cSFGs are about half of eSFGs. Our result supports the compaction and
quenching scenario that galaxies evolve and grow their cores along the track of
cold gas consumption and metal enhancement. The environments of eSFGs and cSFGs
are indistinguishable, suggesting that the compaction process is independent of
any environmental effects at least for low-redshift universe.

cities. However, on-demand (OD) mobility -- such as commercial services Uber,
Grab or Didi -- has started reducing parking needs in urban areas around the
world. This trend is expected to grow significantly with the advent of
autonomous driving, which might render on-demand mobility predominant. Recent
studies have started looking at expected parking reductions with on-demand
mobility, but a systematic framework is still lacking. In this paper, we apply
a data-driven methodology based on shareability networks to address what we
call the ""minimum parking"" problem: what is the minimum parking infrastructure
needed in a city for given on-demand mobility needs? While solving the problem,
we also identify a critical tradeoff between two public policy goals: less
parking means increased vehicle travel from deadheading between trips. By
applying our methodology to the city of Singapore we discover that parking
infrastructure reduction of up to 86% is possible, but at the expense of a 24%
increase in traffic measured as vehicle kilometers travelled (VKT). However, a
more modest 57% reduction in parking is achievable with only a 1.3% increase in
VKT. We find that the tradeoff between parking and traffic obeys an inverse
exponential law which is invariant with the size of the vehicle fleet, leading
to a simple methodology to estimate aggregate parking demand in a city.
Finally, we analyze parking requirements due to passenger pick-ups and show
that increasing convenience produces a substantial increase in parking for
passenger pickup/dropoff. The above mathematical findings can inform
policy-makers, mobility operators, and society at large on the tradeoffs
required in the transition towards pervasive on-demand mobility.

accretion, in a turbulent medium to suggest a reason why some systems form wide
orbital separation gas giants while others do not. In contrast to traditional
growth by ballistic collisions with planetesimals, growth by pebble accretion
is not necessarily limited by doubling times at the highest core mass.
Turbulence, in particular, can cause growth to bottleneck at lower core masses.
We demonstrate how a combination of growth by planetesimal and pebble accretion
limits the maximum semi-major axis where gas giants can form. We find that, for
fiducial disk parameters, strong turbulence ($\alpha \gtrsim 10^{-2}$)
restricts gas giant cores to form interior to $a \lesssim 40 \, \text{AU}$,
while for weak turbulence gas giants can form out to $a \lesssim 70 \,
\text{AU}$. The correspondence between $\alpha$ and semi-major axis depends on
the sizes of small bodies available for growth. This dependence on turbulence
and small-body size distribution may explain the paucity of wide orbital
separation gas giants. We also show that while lower levels of turbulence
($\alpha \lesssim 10^{-4}$) can produce gas giants far out in the disk, we
expect these gas giants to be low-mass ($M \lesssim \, 1 M_J$). These planets
are not luminous enough to have been observed with the current generation of
direct-imaging surveys, which could explain why wide orbital separation gas
giants are currently observed only around A stars.

evolution increases the entanglement of a quantum many-body system. In
contrast, local projective measurements disentangle degrees of freedom and
decrease entanglement. We study the interplay of these competing tendencies by
considering time evolution combining both unitary and projective dynamics. We
begin by constructing a toy model of Bell pair dynamics which demonstrates that
measurements can keep a system in a state of low (i.e. area law) entanglement,
in contrast with the volume law entanglement produced by generic pure unitary
time evolution. While the simplest Bell pair model has area law entanglement
for any measurement rate, as seen in certain non-interacting systems, we show
that more generic models of entanglement can feature an area-to-volume law
transition at a critical value of the measurement rate, in agreement with
recent numerical investigations. As a concrete example of these ideas, we
analytically investigate Clifford evolution in qubit systems which can exhibit
an entanglement transition. We are able to identify stabilizer size
distributions characterizing the area law, volume law and critical 'fixed
points.' We also discuss Floquet random circuits, where the answers depend on
the order of limits - one order of limits yields area law entanglement for any
non-zero measurement rate, whereas a different order of limits allows for an
area law - volume law transition. Finally, we provide a rigorous argument that
a system subjected to projective measurements can only exhibit a volume law
entanglement entropy if it also features a subleading correction term, which
provides a universal signature of projective dynamics in the high-entanglement
phase. Note: The results presented here supersede those of all previous
versions of this manuscript, which contained some erroneous claims.

morphologies arise and what they teach us about the mechanisms of mass ejection
during stellar mergers and common-envelope phases. In this paper, we analyze
hydrodynamic simulations of the lead-in to binary coalescence, a phase of
unstable Roche lobe overflow that takes the binary from the Roche limit
separation to the engulfment of the more compact accretor within the envelope
of the extended donor. As mass transfer runs away at increasing rates, gas
trails away from the binary. Contrary to previous expectations, early mass loss
from the system remains bound to the binary and forms a circumbinary torus.
Later ejecta, generated as the accretor grazes the surface of the donor, have
very different morphologies and are unbound. These two components of mass loss
from the binary interact as later, higher-velocity ejecta collide with the
circumbinary torus formed by earlier mass loss. Unbound ejecta are redirected
toward the poles, and escaping material creates a bipolar outflow. Our findings
show that the transition from bound to unbound ejecta from coalescing binaries
can explain the bipolar nature of their remnants, with implications for our
understanding of the origin of bipolar remnants of stellar-coalescence

rare, especially for space plasma environments currently inaccessible to

imaging spectroscopy available from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to
observe decimetric type III radio bursts in a solar jet with high angular
($\sim$20$''$), spectral ($\sim$1 %), and temporal resolution (50
milliseconds). These observations allow us to derive detailed trajectories of
semi-relativistic (tens of keV) electron beams in the low solar corona with
unprecedentedly high angular precision ($<0''.65$). We found that each group of
electron beams, which corresponds to a cluster of type III bursts with
1-2-second duration, diverges from an extremely compact region ($\sim$600
km$^2$) in the low solar corona. The beam-diverging sites are located behind
the erupting jet spire and above the closed arcades, coinciding with the
presumed location of magnetic reconnection in the jet eruption picture
supported by extreme ultraviolet/X-ray data and magnetic modeling. We interpret
each beam-diverging site as a reconnection null point where multitudes of
magnetic flux tubes join and reconnect. Our data suggest that the null points
likely consist of a high level of density inhomogeneities possibly down to
10-km scales. These results, at least in the present case, strongly favor a
reconnection-driven electron acceleration scenario.

measurements occur randomly at a finite rate $p$ for each degree of freedom, we
show that the system has two dynamical phases: `entangling' and
`disentangling'. The former occurs for $p$ smaller than a critical rate $p_c$,
and is characterized by volume-law entanglement in the steady-state and
`ballistic' entanglement growth after a quench. By contrast, for $p > p_c$ the
system can sustain only area-law entanglement. At $p = p_c$ the steady state is
scale-invariant and, in 1+1D, the entanglement grows logarithmically after a
quench.
  To obtain a simple heuristic picture for the entangling-disentangling
transition, we first construct a toy model that describes the zeroth R\'{e}nyi
entropy in discrete time. We solve this model exactly by mapping it to an
optimization problem in classical percolation.
  The generic entangling-disentangling transition can be diagnosed using the
von Neumann entropy and higher R\'{e}nyi entropies, and it shares many
qualitative features with the toy problem. We study the generic transition
numerically in quantum spin chains, and show that the phenomenology of the two
phases is similar to that of the toy model, but with distinct `quantum'
critical exponents, which we calculate numerically in $1+1$D.
  We examine two different cases for the unitary dynamics: Floquet dynamics for
a nonintegrable Ising model, and random circuit dynamics. We obtain compatible
universal properties in each case, indicating that the entangling-disentangling
phase transition is generic for projectively measured many-body systems. We
discuss the significance of this transition for numerical calculations of
quantum observables in many-body systems.

have a wide single-particle intermediate phase (SPIP), defined as the regime
where localized and extended single-particle states coexist in the spectrum,
leading to a behavior intermediate between purely extended or purely localized
when the system is dynamically quenched from a generic initial state. Our
results thus suggest that both systems could serve as interesting experimental
platforms for studying the interplay between localized and extended states, and
may provide insight into the role of the coupling of small baths to localized
systems. We also calculate the Lyapunov (or localization) exponent for several
incommensurate 1D models exhibiting SPME, finding that such localization
critical exponents for quasiperiodic potential induced localization are
nonuniversal and depend on the microscopic details of the Hamiltonian.

one of the most interesting and potentially useful routes to ferromagnetism in
condensed matter. In recent years such systems have received renewed attention
due to the advent of materials in which Dirac electrons are the mediating
particles, with prominent examples being graphene and topological insulator
surfaces. In this paper, we demonstrate that such systems can host a remarkable
variety of behaviors, in many cases controlled only by the density of electrons
in the system. Uniquely characteristic of these systems is an emergent
long-range form of the spin stiffnes when the Fermi energy resides at a Dirac
point, becoming truly long-range as the magnetization density becomes very
small. It is demonstrated that this leads to screened Coulomb-like interactions
among domain walls, via a subtle mechanism in which the topology of the Dirac
electrons plays a key role: the combination of attraction due to bound in-gap
states that the topology necessitates, and repulsion due to scattering phase
shifts, yields logarithmic interactions over a range of length scales. We
present detailed results for domain walls in a particularly rich system, the
(111) surface of a model topological crystalline insulator. This hosts two-fold
and six- fold degenerate groundstates, with either short-range or emergent
long-range interactions among the spins. In the latter case we demonstrate in
detail the presence of in-gap states associated with domain walls, and argue
that this stabilizes a pseudogap regime at finite temperature. Thus the
topological nature of these systems, through its impact on domain wall
excitations, leads to unique behaviors distinguishing them markedly from their
non-topological analogs.

coupled to gravity, we analyze the limit in K\""ahler moduli space where the
gauge coupling tends to zero while gravity is kept dynamical. We show that such
a limit must be located at infinite distance in the moduli space. As expected,
the low-energy effective theory breaks down in this limit due to a tower of
charged particles becoming massless. These are the excitations of an
asymptotically tensionless string, which is shown to coincide with a critical
heterotic string compactified to six dimensions. For a more quantitative
analysis, we focus on a $U(1)$ gauge symmetry and use a chain of dualities and
mirror symmetry to determine the elliptic genus of the nearly tensionless
string, which is given in terms of certain meromorphic weak Jacobi forms. Their
modular properties in turn allow us to determine the mass-to-charge ratios of
certain string excitations near the tensionless limit. We then provide evidence
that the tower of asymptotically massless charged states satisfies the
(sub-)Lattice Weak Gravity Conjecture, the Completeness Conjecture, and the
Swampland Distance Conjecture. Quite remarkably, we find that the number
theoretic properties of the elliptic genus conspire with the balance of
gravitational and scalar forces of extremal black holes, such as to produce a
narrowly tuned charge spectrum of superextremal states. As a byproduct, we show
how to compute elliptic genera of both critical and non-critical strings, when
refined by Mordell-Weil $U(1)$ symmetries in F-theory.

examine the purely gravitational interaction of idealised galaxy models falling

This modification of gravity gives rise to an external field effect (EFE),
where the internal dynamics of a system are affected by the presence of
external gravitational fields. We examine the consequences of the EFE on low
and high mass disk galaxies in time-evolving analytic background cluster
potentials, considering orbits with weak and strong tidal fields. By varying
the orbital plane of the galaxies we also test the effect of having the tidal
interaction orthogonal or parallel to the disk. Furthermore, we consider as a
control sample models where the EFE has been removed and they are only affected
by tides. Our results suggest that MOND cluster galaxies should exhibit clear
asymmetries in their isophotes, suffer increased mass loss and a reduction in
their rotation curves due to the combined effect of cluster tides and the
external field. In particular, low mass galaxies are hit hard by the EFE,
becoming dominated by dispersion rather than rotation even in the absence of

anisotropy power spectrum is dominated by undetected galaxies at small angular
scales and diffuse background of Galactic emission at large angular scales. In
addition to these known sources, the infrared background also arises from
intra-halo light (IHL) at $z < 3$ associated with tidally-stripped stars during
galaxy mergers. Moreover, it contains information on the very first galaxies
from the epoch of reionization (EoR). The EoR signal has a spectral energy
distribution (SED) that goes to zero near optical wavelengths due to Lyman
absorption, while other signals have spectra that vary smoothly with frequency.
Due to differences in SEDs and spatial clustering, these components may be
separated in a multi-wavelength-fluctuation experiment. To study the extent to
which EoR fluctuations can be separated in the presence of IHL, extra-galactic

issue. In this paper, we develop a novel geometric analysis for a variant of
SSC, named affine SSC (ASSC), for the problem of clustering data from a union
of affine subspaces. Our contributions include a new concept called affine
independence for capturing the arrangement of a collection of affine subspaces.
Under the affine independence assumption, we show that ASSC is guaranteed to
produce subspace-preserving affinity. Moreover, inspired by the phenomenon that
the $\ell_1$ regularization no longer induces sparsity when the solution is
nonnegative, we further show that subspace-preserving recovery can be achieved
under much weaker conditions for all data points other than the extreme points
of samples from each subspace. In addition, we confirm a curious observation
that the affinity produced by ASSC may be subspace-dense---which could
guarantee the subspace-preserving affinity of ASSC to produce correct
clustering under rather weak conditions. We validate the theoretical findings
on carefully designed synthetic data and evaluate the performance of ASSC on
several real data sets.

the incoherent averaging of the polarization state over repeated observations

systems is important in the fields of ecology, economics, critical
infrastructures, and organizational behaviour. Whilst we understand small-scale
resilience well, our understanding of large-scale networked resilience is
limited. Recent research in predicting the effective network-level resilience
pattern has advanced our understanding of the coupling relationship between
topology and dynamics. However, a method to estimate the resilience of an
individual node within an arbitrarily large complex network governed by
non-linear dynamics is still lacking. Here, we develop a sequential mean-field
approach and show that after 1-3 steps of estimation, the node-level resilience
function can be represented with up to 98\% accuracy. This new understanding
compresses the higher dimensional relationship into a one-dimensional dynamic
for tractable understanding, mapping the relationship between local dynamics
and the statistical properties of network topology. By applying this framework
to case studies in ecology and biology, we are able to not only understand the
general resilience pattern of the network, but also identify the nodes at the
greatest risk of failure and predict the impact of perturbations. These
findings not only shed new light on the causes of resilience loss from cascade
effects in networked systems, but the identification capability could also be
used to prioritize protection, quantify risk, and inform the design of new

that highlights major inconsistencies in the extraction of the charge radius of
the proton from muonic Lamb-shift experiments as compared against experiments
using elastic electron scattering. For the latter, the determination of the
charge radius involves an extrapolation of the experimental form factor to zero
momentum transfer.
  Purpose: To estimate the proton radius by introducing a novel non-parametric
approach to model the electric form factor of the proton.
  Methods: Within a Bayesian paradigm, we develop a model flexible enough to
fit the data without any parametric assumptions on the form factor. The
Bayesian estimation is guided by imposing only two physical constraints on the
form factor: (a) its value at zero momentum transfer (normalization) and (b)
its overall shape, assumed to be a monotonically decreasing function of the
momentum transfer. Variants of these assumptions are explored to assess the
impact of these constraints.
  Results: So far our results are inconclusive in regard to the proton puzzle,
as they depend on both, the assumed constrains and the range of experimental
data used. For example, if only low momentum-transfer data is used, adopting
only the normalization constraint provides a value compatible with the smaller
muonic result, while imposing only the shape constraint favors the larger
electronic value.
  Conclusions: We have presented a novel technique to estimate the proton
radius from electron scattering data based on a non-parametric Gaussian
process. We have shown the impact of the physical constraints imposed on the
form factor and of the range of experimental data used. In this regard, we are
hopeful that as this technique is refined and with the anticipated new results
from the PRad experiment, we will get closer to resolve of the puzzle.

CDW state competing with superconductivity, but others raise the possibility of
a CDW-superconductivity intertwined order, or more elusive pair-density wave
(PDW). Here we have used proton irradiation to induce disorder in crystals of
La$_{1.875}$Ba$_{0.125}$CuO$_4$ and observed a striking 50% increase of

spectral windows. These data provide a detailed view on the compact as well as
extended radio emission of our Galaxy and thousands of extragalactic background
sources. We used the BLOBCAT software and extracted 10916 sources. After
removing spurious source detections caused by the sidelobes of the synthesised

images to a common resolution of 25"" and extracted the peak flux density of
each source in each spectral window (SPW) to determine the spectral indices
$\alpha$ (assuming $I(\nu)\propto\nu^\alpha$). By cross-matching with catalogs
of HII regions, SNRs, PNe, and pulsars, we found radio counterparts for 840 HII
regions, 52 SNRs, 164 PNe, and 38 pulsars. We found 79 continuum sources that
are associated with X-ray sources. We identified 699 ultra-steep spectral
sources ($\alpha < -1.3$) that could be high-redshift galaxies. Around 9000 of
the sources we extracted are not classified specifically, but based on their
spatial and spectral distribution, a large fraction of them is likely to be
extragalactic background sources. More than 7750 sources do not have

connection between the $AdS_{5}\times S^{5}$ superstring lambda model on
$S^{1}=\partial D$ and a double Chern-Simons (CS) theory on $D$ based on the
Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{psu}(2,2|4)$ was suggested, after introduction of
the spectral parameter $z$. The relation between both theories mimics the
well-known CS/WZW symplectic reduction equivalence but is non-chiral in nature.
All the statements are now valid in the strong sense, i.e. valid on the whole
phase space, making the connection between both theories precise. By
constructing a $z$-dependent gauge field in the 2+1 Hamiltonian CS theory it is
shown that: i) by performing a symplectic reduction of the CS theory the
Maillet algebra satisfied by the extended Lax connection of the lambda model
emerges as a boundary current algebra and ii) the Poisson algebra of the
supertraces of $z$-dependent Wilson loops in the CS theory obey some sort of
spectral parameter generalization of the Goldman bracket. The latter algebra is
interpreted as the precursor of the (ambiguous) lambda model monodromy matrix
Poisson algebra prior to the symplectic reduction. As a consequence, the
problematic non-ultralocality of lambda models is avoided (for any value of the
deformation parameter $\lambda \subset [0,1]$), showing how the lambda model
classical integrable structure can be understood as a byproduct of the
symplectic reduction process of the $z$-dependent CS theory.

complexity, complexities of individual components and edge weights. The
essential property of the spectral complexity metric is that it accounts for
directed cycles in the graph. In engineered and software systems, such cycles
give rise to sub-system interdependencies and increase risk for unintended

quasiparticle excitations at THz frequencies called electromagnons. In order to
measure the electromagnons in CuO, we exploit single-crystal CuO as a THz

along only one major polarizability axis in the monoclinic a-c plane. We show
the excitation can be represented using the Lorentz oscillator model, and
discuss how these Lorentz parameters evolve with temperature. Our findings are
in excellent agreement with previous characterizations by THz time-domain

a key requirement for seamless operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in future
smart cities. To this end, cellular small base stations (SBSs) with edge
computing capabilities can reduce the end-to-end (E2E) service delay by
processing requested tasks from AVs locally, without forwarding the tasks to a
remote cloud server. Nonetheless, due to the limited computational capabilities
of the SBSs, coupled with the scarcity of the wireless bandwidth resources,
minimizing the E2E latency for AVs and achieving a reliable V2I network is
challenging. In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize
AVs-to-SBSs association and bandwidth allocation to maximize the reliability of
the V2I network. By using tools from labor matching markets, the proposed
framework can effectively perform distributed association of AVs to SBSs, while
accounting for the latency needs of AVs as well as the limited computational
and bandwidth resources of SBSs. Moreover, the convergence of the proposed
algorithm to a core allocation between AVs and SBSs is proved and its ability
to capture interdependent computational and transmission latencies for AVs in a
V2I network is characterized. Simulation results show that by optimizing the
E2E latency, the proposed algorithm substantially outperforms conventional cell
association schemes, in terms of service reliability and latency.

for efficient hazard detection and disaster management in future cyber-physical
systems such as smart cities. In this regard, exploiting unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) swarms is a promising solution to inspect vast areas efficiently
and with low cost. In fact, UAVs can easily fly and reach inspection points,
record surveillance data, and send this information to a wireless base station
(BS). Nonetheless, in many cases, such as operations at remote areas, the UAVs
cannot be guided directly by the BS in real-time to find their path. Moreover,
another key challenge of inspection by UAVs is the limited battery capacity.
Thus, realizing the vision of autonomous inspection via UAVs requires
energy-efficient path planning that takes into account the energy constraint of
each individual UAV. In this paper, a novel path planning algorithm is proposed
for performing energy-efficient inspection, under stringent energy availability
constraints for each UAV. The developed framework takes into account all
aspects of energy consumption for a UAV swarm during the inspection operations,
including energy required for flying, hovering, and data transmission. It is
shown that the proposed algorithm can address the path planning problem
efficiently in polynomial time. Simulation results show that the proposed
algorithm can yield substantial performance gains in terms of minimizing the
overall inspection time and energy. Moreover, the results provide guidelines to
determine parameters such as the number of required UAVs and amount of energy,

shocked and heated during the recoil of the merged hole, causing a
near-simultaneous electromagnetic counterpart to the gravitational wave event.
The shocks occur around the recoil radius, where the disc orbital velocity is
equal to the recoil velocity. The amount of mass present near this radius at
the time of the merger is critical in determining how much radiation is
released. We explore the evolution of a circumbinary disc in two limits. First,
we consider an accretion disc that feels no torque from the binary. The disc
does not survive until the merger unless there is a dead zone, a region of low
turbulence. Even with the dead zone, the surface density in this case may be
small. Second, we consider a disc that feels a strong binary torque that
prevents accretion on to the binary. In this case there is significantly more
mass in regions of interest at the time of the merger. A dead zone in this disc
increases the mass close to the recoil radius. For typical binary-disc
parameters we expect accretion to be significantly slowed by the resonant
torque from the binary, and for a dead zone to be present. We conclude that
provided significant mass orbits the binary after the formation of the black
hole binary and that the radiation produced in recoil shocks can escape the
flow efficiently, there is likely to be an observable electromagnetic signal
from black hole binary mergers.

to the advancement of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). The majority of
deep re-ID methods focus on designing new CNN architectures, while less
attention is paid on investigating the loss functions. Verification loss and
identification loss are two types of losses widely used to train various deep
re-ID models, both of which however have limitations. Verification loss guides
the networks to generate feature embeddings of which the intra-class variance
is decreased while the inter-class ones is enlarged. However, training networks
with verification loss tends to be of slow convergence and unstable performance
when the number of training samples is large. On the other hand, identification
loss has good separating and scalable property. But its neglect to explicitly
reduce the intra-class variance limits its performance on re-ID, because the
same person may have significant appearance disparity across different camera
views. To avoid the limitations of the two types of losses, we propose a new
loss, called support neighbor (SN) loss. Rather than being derived from data
sample pairs or triplets, SN loss is calculated based on the positive and
negative support neighbor sets of each anchor sample, which contain more
valuable contextual information and neighborhood structure that are beneficial
for more stable performance. To ensure scalability and separability, a
softmax-like function is formulated to push apart the positive and negative
support sets. To reduce intra-class variance, the distance between the anchor's
nearest positive neighbor and furthest positive sample is penalized.
Integrating SN loss on top of Resnet50, superior re-ID results to the

labels, ranging from tens to a few hundreds. With a large number of labels,
training and evaluation of such task become extremely challenging due to
correlation between labels and lack of datasets with complete annotations. We
formulate semantic segmentation as a problem of image segmentation given a
semantic concept, and propose a novel system which can potentially handle an
unlimited number of concepts, including objects, parts, stuff, and attributes.
We achieve this using a weakly and semi-supervised framework leveraging
multiple datasets with different levels of supervision. We first train a deep
neural network on a 6M stock image dataset with only image-level labels to
learn visual-semantic embedding on 18K concepts. Then, we refine and extend the
embedding network to predict an attention map, using a curated dataset with
bounding box annotations on 750 concepts. Finally, we train an attention-driven
class agnostic segmentation network using an 80-category fully annotated
dataset. We perform extensive experiments to validate that the proposed system
performs competitively to the state of the art on fully supervised concepts,
and is capable of producing accurate segmentations for weakly learned and
unseen concepts.

presence of a mechanistic interaction between genetic (G) and environmental (E)
risk factors by testing for the presence of an additive GxE interaction. In
case-control studies involving a rare disease, a statistical test of no
additive interaction typically entails a test of no relative excess risk due to
interaction (RERI). It is also well known that a test of multiplicative
interaction exploiting G-E independence can be dramatically more powerful than
standard logistic regression for case-control data. Likewise, it has recently
been shown that a likelihood ratio test of a null RERI incorporating the G-E
independence assumption (RERI-LRT) outperforms the standard RERI approach. In
this paper, the authors describe a general, yet relatively straightforward
approach to test for GxE additive interaction exploiting G-E independence. The
approach which relies on regression models for G and E is particularly
attractive because, unlike the RERI-LRT, it allows the regression model for the
binary outcome to remain unrestricted. Therefore, the new methodology is
completely robust to possible mis-specification in the outcome regression. This
is particularly important for settings not easily handled by RERI-LRT, such as
when E is a count or a continuous exposure with multiple components, or when
there are several auxiliary covariates in the regression model. While the
proposed approach avoids fitting an outcome regression, it nonetheless still
allows for straightforward covariate adjustment. The methods are illustrated
through an extensive simulation study and an ovarian cancer empirical
application.

orthogonal to the axis of the molecular outflow as seen in the SMA $^{12}$CO

in X-rays. We have studied the long-term evolution of this source in the
fallback disc model. The model can reproduce the period, period derivative and
X-ray luminosity of J1819-1458 simultaneously in the accretion phase at ages
$\sim 2 \times 10^5$ yr. We obtained reasonable model curves with a magnetic
dipole field strength $B_0 \sim 5 \times 10^{11}$ G on the pole of the neutron
star, which is much weaker than the field inferred from the dipole-torque
formula. With this $B_0$ and the measured period, we find J1819-1458 below and
close to the radio pulsar death line. Our results are not sensitive to initial
period, and the source properties can be produced with a large range of disc
masses. Our simulations indicate that J1819-1458 is evolving towards the
properties of dim isolated neutron stars at later phases of evolution. This
implies a close evolutionary link between RRATs and dim isolated neutron stars.
For other RRATs with measured period derivatives and unknown X-ray
luminosities, we have estimated the lower limits on the $B_0$ values in the
fallback disc model. These limits allow a dipole field distribution for RRATs
that could fill the $B_0$ gap between the estimated $B_0$ ranges of dim thermal
isolated neutron stars and central compact objects in the same model.

difficult to estimate the true significance of the detection. In this work, we
report a $\sim$ 330-day QPO in the Fermi/LAT observations of the blazar Mrk 501

multiple approaches to the time series analysis and employed four widely known

represent frequency domain based methods whereas epoch folding and
z-transformed discrete auto-correlation function are time-domain based

sunward outflow jets also display a power-law distribution in temporal
frequency domain. The length-to-width ratio of the current sheet is estimated
to be larger than theoretical threshold of and thus ensures occurrence of

turbulent magnetic reconnection occurring in the long stretching current sheet.

subtle role to characterize the topological phase in $1$D. On the one hand, it
is not a gauge invariant, on the other hand, the Zak phase difference between
two quantum phases can be used to identify the topological phase transitions. A
non-Hermitian system may inherit some characters of a Hermitian system, such as
entirely real spectrum, unitary evolution, topological energy band, etc. In
this paper, we study the influence of non-Hermitian term on the Zak phase for a
class of non-Hermitian systems. We show exactly that the real part of the Zak
phase remains unchanged in a bipartite lattice. In a concrete example, $1$D
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, we find that the real part of Zak phase can
be obtained by an adiabatic process. To demonstrate this finding, we
investigate a scattering problem for a time-dependent scattering center, which
is a magnetic-flux-driven non-Hermitian SSH ring. Owing to the nature of the
Zak phase, the intriguing features of this design are the wave-vector
independence and allow two distinct behaviors, perfect transmission or
confinement, depending on the timing of a flux impulse threading the ring. When
the flux is added during a wavepacket travelling within the ring, the
wavepacket is confined in the scatter partially. Otherwise, it exhibits perfect
transmission through the scatter. Our finding extends the understanding and
broaden the possible application of geometric phase in a non-Hermitian system.

any $k$-partition $\mathcal{P}$ of $\Omega$, there exists $g\in G$ mapping $A$
to a transversal (a section) for $\mathcal{P}$. This property is a substantial
weakening of the $k$-universal transversal property, or $k$-ut, investigated by
the first and third author, which required this condition to hold for all
$k$-subsets $A$ of the domain. Our first task in this paper is to investigate
the $k$-et property and to decide which groups satisfy it. For example, we show
that, for $8\le k\le n/2$, the only groups with $k$-et are the symmetric and
alternating groups; this is best possible since the Mathieu group $M_{24}$ has
$7$-et. We determine all groups with $k$-et for $4\le k\le n/2$, up to some
unresolved cases for $k=4,5$, and describe the property for $k=2,3$ in
permutation group language.
  In the previous work, the results were applied to semigroups, in particular,
to the question of when the semigroup $\langle G,t\rangle$ is regular, where
$t$ is a map of rank $k$ (with $k<n/2$); this turned out to be equivalent to
the $k$-ut property. The question investigated here is when there is a
$k$-subset $A$ of the domain such that $\langle G, t\rangle$ is regular for all
maps $t$ with image $A$. This turns out to be more delicate; the $k$-et
property (with $A$ as witnessing set) is a necessary condition, and the
combination of $k$-et and $(k-1)$-ut is sufficient, but the truth lies
somewhere between. Given the knowledge that a group under consideration has the
necessary condition of $k$-et, we solve the regularity question for $k\le n/2$

resulting in additional decay/response time of the device. Here, we demonstrate
that the trap states in two-dimensional ReS2 could be efficiently modulated by
defect engineering through molecule decoration. The deep traps that greatly
prolong the response time could be mostly filled by Protoporphyrin (H2PP)

can be several orders of magnitude faster than the as-prepared device.
Moreover, the specific detectivity of the device is enhanced (as high as ~1.89

transfer between ReS2 and molecules. Defect engineering of trap states
therefore provides a solution to achieve photodetectors with both high

propagating the assigned weights over a protein-protein interaction network

the two-point flexural test and their exploitation conditions were studied. The
results showed that if the FRP sheets are used appropriately and with proper
bracing in strengthening the concrete beam samples, there will be a significant
increase in their shear and flexural strength. Moreover, it was observed that
relative deformation measured on the concrete surface and the GFRP sheet is
proportional.

Being decentralized, there are no dedicated web servers in DWeb; Devices that
retrieve web contents also serve their cached data to peer devices with
straight privacy-preserving mechanisms. The fact that contents in DWeb are
distributed, replicated, and decentralized lead to a number of key advantages
over the conventional web. These include better resiliency against network
partitioning and distributed-denial-of-service attacks (DDoS), and better
browsing experiences in terms of shorter latency and higher throughput.
Moreover, DWeb provides tamper-proof contents because each content piece is
uniquely identified by a cryptographic hash. DWeb also clicks well with future
Internet architectures, such as Named Data Networking (NDN).Search engines have
been an inseparable element of the Web. Contemporary (""Web 2.0"") search
engines, however, provide centralized services. They are thus subject to DDoS
attacks, insider threat, and ethical issues like search bias and censorship. As
the web moves from being centralized to being decentralized, search engines
ought to follow. We propose QueenBee, a decentralized search engine for DWeb.
QueenBee is so named because worker bees and honeycomb are a common metaphor
for distributed architectures, with the queen being the one that holds the
colony together. QueenBee aims to revolutionize the search engine business
model by offering incentives to both content providers and peers that
participate in QueenBee's page indexing and ranking operations.

harmonic oscillator potential, but it cannot resolve the Coulomb potential
problem. This is because the path integral cannot properly take into account
the boundary condition, which is due to the presence of the scattering states
in the Coulomb potential system. On the other hand, the Sommerfeld quantization
can reproduce the right energy spectrum of both harmonic oscillator and Coulomb
potential cases since the boundary condition is effectively taken into account
in this semiclassical treatment. The basic difference between the two schemes
should be that no constraint is imposed on the wave function in the path
integral while the Sommerfeld quantization rule is derived by requiring that
the state vector should be a single-valued function. The limitation of the
semiclassical method is also clarified in terms of the square well and
$\delta(x)$ function potential models.

stack which defines the rules for data sent across networks. IPv4 is the fourth
version of IP and first commercially available for deployment set by ARPANET in
1983 which is a 32 bit long address and can support up to 232 devices. In April
2017, all Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) confirmed that IPv4 addresses are
exhausted and cannot be allocated anymore implying any new organization
requesting a block of Internet addresses will be allocated IPv6. This creates
troubles of interoperability, migration and deployment, and therefore
organizations hesitated to use IPv6 borrowing IPv4 addresses from other big
organizations instead. Currently, when IPv4 is not available, and IPv6 is not
adopted for around 20 years, the question arises whether IPv6 will still be
accepted by the computer society or will it have an end of life soon with
alternate better protocol such as ID based networks taking its place. This
paper claims that IPv6 has lost its deployment window and can be safely skipped
when new ID based protocols are available which not only have simple
interoperability, deployment and migration guidelines but also provide advanced
features as compared to IPv6. The paper provides answers to these questions
with a comprehensive comparison of IPv6 with its available alternatives and
reasons of IPv6 failures in its adoption. Finally, the paper declares IPv6 as a
dead protocol and suggests to use newer available protocols in future.

for networks to efficiently cater application specific needs of a user. In this

is calculated in the best interest of an application using the network. These
advanced routing algorithms can exploit application state data to enhance
advanced network services such as anycast, edge cloud computing and cyber
physical systems (CPS). In this work, we aim to design such a routing algorithm
where the router decisions are based upon convex optimization techniques.

are considered. Such nanostructures were fabricated by electrochemical etching
of monocrystalline Si substrates by applying periodically changed current
density. Hereby, the multilayered structures with specific phononic properties
were formed. Photoacoustic (PA) technique in gas-microphone configuration was
applied for thermal conductivity evaluation. Experimental amplitude-frequency
dependencies were adjusted by temperature distribution simulation with thermal
conductivity of the multilayered porous structure as a fitting parameter. The
experimentally determined values of thermal conductivity were found to be
significantly lower than theoretically calculated ones. Such difference was
associated with the presence of thermal resistance at the interfaces between
porous layers with different porosities arising because of elastic parameters
mismatch (acoustical mismatch). Accordingly, the magnitude of this interfacial
thermal resistance was experimentally evaluated for the first time.
Furthermore, crucial impact of the resistance on thermal transport perturbation
in a multilayered porous silicon structure was revealed.
