to probe BSM scenarios where proton-proton colliders fall short due to the
experimental difficulties in reconstructing the signal due to the large
hadronic backgrounds. The leit-motiv of these examples are long-lived particles
(LLPs), which have received recently a lot of attention from both the
experimental and theoretical communities. We find that the proposed $e^-p$
colliders can be competitive against their more energetic $pp$ incarnations for
lifetimes between a millimeter and a micron, depending on the physics scenario
under consideration.

perturbation that typically describes the interplay between regular
prescription use, addictive use, and the process of rehabilitation from
addiction and vice-versa. In particular, we provide two-sided bounds on the
solution of the transition density function for the Fokker-Planck equation that
corresponds to the opioid epidemic dynamical model, when a random perturbation
enters only through the dynamics of the susceptible group in the compartmental
model. Here, the proof for such bounds basically relies on the interpretation
of the solution for the transition density function as the value function of a
certain optimal stochastic control problem. Finally, as a possible interesting
development in this direction, we also provide an estimate for the attainable
exit probability with which the solution for the randomly perturbed opioid
epidemic dynamical model exits from a given bounded open domain during a
certain time interval. Note that such qualitative information on the first
exit-time as well as two-sided bounds on the transition density function are
useful for developing effective and fact-informed intervention strategies that
primarily aim at curbing opioid epidemics or assisting in interpreting outcome
results from opioid-related policies.

major quantities determining the steric part of the PMF barrier for the

the symmetry breaking occurs via a nonequilibrium quantum phase transition. For

switching rate of an oscillator between its period-2 states dependent on the
states of other oscillators. This allows mapping the oscillators onto a system
of coupled spins. Away from the bifurcation parameter values where the period-2

bifurcation point or for identical oscillators, the stationary state can be
mapped on that of the Ising model with an effective temperature $\propto

marginally consistent with a Milky Way IMF just beyond R$_{e}$. The inferred
central V-band M/L ratio is in excellent agreement with the previously reported

of the M/L ratio may be evidence for a two-phase formation in this object, with
the central regions forming differently to the outskirts. We also report

of the gapless band structure of the excitation spectrum, the Landau critical
velocity vanishes if the motion is not strictly parallel to the stripes, and
energy dissipation takes place at any speed. Moreover, due to the spin-orbit
coupling, the drag force can develop a component perpendicular to the velocity
of the impurity. Finally, by estimating the time over which the energy
dissipation occurs, we find that for slow impurities the effects of friction
are negligible on a time scale up to several seconds, which is comparable with
the duration of a typical experiment.

critical point remained elusive, and only fragments of a quantitative
analytical understanding existed up to now. In the present paper we carry out a
detailed analysis of the current-current correlation function for the
conductivity tensor, initially in the Chalker-Coddington network model for the
IQHE plateau transition and then in its exact reformulation as a supersymmetric
vertex model. We develop a heuristic argument for the continuum limit of the

non-Abelian current algebra at level n = 4. Based on precise lattice
expressions for the CFT primary fields we predict the multifractal scaling
exponents of critical wavefunctions to be q(1-q)/4. The Lagrangian of the RG
fixed-point theory for r retarded and r advanced replicas is proposed to be the

in the limit that it is sparse -- highly localized and vanishing in the
thermodynamic limit. We begin in 1D with arbitrary disorder assigned to a
finite number of bonds and study how the system renormalizes, finding
non-trivial fixed point structure for any given bond with a separatrix at zero
bond strength, equivalent to inserting a break in the chain. Either side of
this critical line, renormalization group (RG) trajectories flow towards one of
two attractors on which the disordered bonds settle onto ferromagnetic or
anti-ferromagnetic (AF) couplings of equal and opposite magnitude. Bonds that
settle on an AF attractor are equivalent to inserting a twist in the chain at
the location of the bond, implying a multi-kink ground state solution.
Qualitatively different behavior emerges at the RG step when bonds start to
coalesce, with the chain `untwisting' whenever two AF bonds coalesce. Our
findings generalize to higher dimensions for codimension one defects that are
sparse from the perspective of the orthogonal complement lattice. In 2D, the
$\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry of the model has an IR manifestation where one can
construct field strengths and Wilson loops (which characterize frustration)
from fundamental plaquette variables. In the non-sparse limit where the
disorder parameter is drawn from an arbitrary but homogeneously assigned
probability distribution function, we recover previously found fixed
distributions as special cases, but find only the trivial paramagnetic
distribution to be an attractor. For non-homogeneously assigned disorder that
is sufficiently dilute however, we find the Edwards-Anderson model with equal
probability $\pm J$ bonds to also be an IR attractor.

this model is strongly analogous to the celebrated Kitaev chain model of a 1D
p-wave superconductor. The system exhibits phase-dependent chirality: photons
propagate and are amplified in a direction that is determined by the phase of
the initial drive or excitation. Further, we find a drastic sensitivity to
boundary conditions: for a range of parameters, the boundary-less system has
only delocalized, dynamically unstable modes, while a finite open chain is
described by localized, dynamically stable modes. While our model is described
by a Hermitian Hamiltonian, we show that it has a surprising connection to
non-Hermitian asymmetric-hopping models.

the resulting theory is characterized by fluctuations that propagate with an

to study such a set-up in a model-independent manner, highlighting the
peculiarities and subtleties that make it different from the standard case. In
particular, perturbations feature exponentially growing and decaying modes

Nevertheless, we prove that in an interesting limit the dimensionless
bispectrum is in fact universal, depending only on the speed of sound and on
the cutoff scale that limits the validity of the effective theory. Contrary to
the power spectrum, we find that the bispectrum does not display an exponential

in flattened configurations in a way that is ultraviolet sensitive.

the ac susceptibility. Our results are consistent with the early theory for the

incurred when running quantum circuits on near-term quantum computers.
Specifically, it is envisaged that near-term quantum computers will have low
qubit connectivity: each qubit will only be able to interact with a subset of
the other qubits, a reality typically represented by a qubit interaction graph
in which a vertex represents a qubit and an edge represents a possible direct
2-qubit interaction (gate). Thus the depth overhead is unavoidably incurred by
introducing swap gates into the quantum circuit to enable general qubit
interactions. This paper proves that there exist quantum circuits where a depth
overhead in $\Omega(\log n)$ must necessarily be incurred when running quantum
circuits with $n$ qubits on quantum computers whose qubit interaction graph has
finite degree, but that such a logarithmic depth overhead is achievable. The
latter is shown by the construction of a 4-regular qubit interaction graph and
associated compilation algorithm that can execute any quantum circuit with only
a logarithmic depth overhead.

performance in terms of asymptotic variance of the estimated distribution. The

learning in the real world is the need to specify an oracle reward function

avoid this challenge by instead inferring a reward function from expert
behavior. While appealing, it can be impractically expensive to collect
datasets of demonstrations that cover the variation common in the real world
(e.g. opening any type of door). Thus in practice, IRL must commonly be
performed with only a limited set of demonstrations where it can be exceedingly
difficult to unambiguously recover a reward function. In this work, we exploit
the insight that demonstrations from other tasks can be used to constrain the
set of possible reward functions by learning a ""prior"" that is specifically
optimized for the ability to infer expressive reward functions from limited

recover rewards from images for novel tasks and provide intuition as to how our

different wavelengths and derived colours have been used to estimate their
corresponding cosmological distances. From the fields of galaxy and AGN
evolution to precision cosmology, the number of scientific projects relying on
such distance measurements, called photometric redshifts, have exploded. The
benefits of photometric redshifts is that all sources detected in photometric
images can have some distance estimates relatively cheaply. The major drawback
is that these cheap estimates have a low precision when compared with the
resource-expensive spectroscopy. The methodology to estimate redshifts has been
through several major revolutions throughout the last decades, triggered by
increasingly more stringent requirements on the photometric redshift accuracy.
Here, we review the various techniques to obtain photometric redshifts, from
template-fitting to machine learning and hybrid systems. We also describe the
state-of-the-art results on current extra-galactic samples and explain how
survey strategy choices impact redshift accuracy. We close the review with a

changes due to the transition from snow at the surface to glacial ice below,
affecting the propagation of radio signals in that region. We compare our
observations to a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) electromagnetic wave
simulation, which supports the existence of three classes of propagation: a
bulk propagation ray-bending mode that leads to so-called ""shadowed"" regions
for certain geometries of transmission, a surface-wave mode induced by the
ice/air interface, and an arbitrary-depth horizontal propagation mode that
requires perturbations from a smooth density gradient. In the non-shadowed
region, our measurements are consistent with the bulk propagation ray-bending
mode both in timing and in amplitude. We also observe signals in the shadowed
region, in conflict with a bulk-propagation-only ray-bending model, but
consistent with FDTD simulations using a variety of firn models for Summit
Station. The amplitude and timing of our measurements in all geometries are
consistent with the predictions from FDTD simulations. In the shadowed region,
the amplitude of the observed signals is consistent with a best-fit coupling
fraction value of $2.4$% (0.06% in power) or less to a surface or horizontal
propagation mode from the bulk propagation mode. The relative amplitude of
observable signals in the two regions is important for experiments that aim to
detect radio emission from astrophysical high-energy neutrinos interacting in
glacial ice, which rely on a radio propagation model to inform simulations and
perform event reconstruction.

is focused on uniformization problems: transformation of sets to canonical
sets, using maps that preserve the geometry in some sense. More specifically,
the main question addressed is the uniformization of planar Sierpinski carpets
by square Sierpinski carpets, using methods of potential theory on carpets.
  We first develop a potential theory and study harmonic functions on planar
Sierpinski carpets. We introduce a discrete notion of Sobolev spaces on
Sierpinski carpets and use this to define harmonic functions. Our approach
differs from the classical approach of potential theory in metric spaces
because it takes the ambient space that contains the carpet into account. We
prove basic properties such as the existence and uniqueness of the solution to
the Dirichlet problem, Liouville's theorem, Harnack's inequality, strong
maximum principle, and equicontinuity of harmonic functions.
  Then we utilize this notion of harmonic functions to prove a uniformization
result for Sierpinski carpets. Namely, it is proved that every planar
Sierpinski carpet whose peripheral disks are uniformly fat, uniform quasiballs
can be mapped to a square Sierpinski carpet with a map that preserves carpet
modulus. If the assumptions on the peripheral circles are strengthened to
uniformly relatively separated, uniform quasicircles, then the map is a
quasisymmetry. The real part of the uniformizing map is the solution of a
certain Dirichlet-type problem. Then a harmonic conjugate of that map is
constructed using the methods developed by Rajala arXiv:1412.3348.

the hopping degrees of freedom are strongly coupled to $SU(N)$ gauge bosons
which themselves are strongly interacting. The vacuum expectation value (VEV)
of the hopping term (i.e. the hopping energy) is analyzed in the gravity dual
as a function of the bulk mass of the field dual to the hopping term, as well
as of the coupling constants of the model. The bulk mass controls the anomalous
dimension (i.e. the critical exponent) of the hopping term in the $SU(N)$
Bose-Hubbard model. We compare the hopping energy to the corresponding result
in a numerical simulation of the ungauged $SU(N)$ Bose-Hubbard model. We find
agreement when the hopping parameter is smaller than the other couplings. Our
analysis shows that the kinetic energy increases as the bulk mass increases,
due to increased contributions from the IR. The holographic Bose-Hubbard model
is then compared with the string theory construction of a $SU(N)$ Fermi-Hubbard
model. The string theory construction makes it possible to describe
fluctuations around a half-filled state in the supergravity limit, which map to
${\cal O}(1)$ occupation number fluctuations in the Fermi-Hubbard model at half
filling. Finally, the VEV of the Bose-Hubbard model is shown to agree with the
one of the fermionic Hubbard model with the help of a two-site version of the

finite. This naturally suggests a hybrid numerical algorithm to explicitly
obtain the solution also beyond the convergence domain of the power series

be extremely fast and stable. When applied to option pricing, our method

naturally captures multi-player games with imperfect information, the problem
turns out to be undecidable. We introduce a syntactical class of ""hierarchical

formula, strategy quantifications are concerned with finer observations of the
model. We prove that model-checking SLii restricted to hierarchical instances
is decidable. This result, because it allows for complex patterns of
existential and universal quantification on strategies, greatly generalises
previous ones, such as decidability of multi-player games with imperfect
information and hierarchical observations, and decidability of distributed
synthesis for hierarchical systems. To establish the decidability result, we
introduce and study QCTL*ii, an extension of QCTL* (itself an extension of CTL*
with second-order quantification over atomic propositions) by parameterising
its quantifiers with observations. The simple syntax of QCTL* ii allows us to
provide a conceptually neat reduction of SLii to QCTL*ii that separates
concerns, allowing one to forget about strategies and players and focus solely
on second-order quantification. While the model-checking problem of QCTL*ii is,
in general, undecidable, we identify a syntactic fragment of hierarchical
formulas and prove, using an automata-theoretic approach, that it is decidable.
The decidability result for SLii follows since the reduction maps hierarchical
instances of SLii to hierarchical formulas of QCTL*ii .

observations of HD189733A with the ESO HARPS spectrometer at R=115,000,
profiles for stronger and weaker Fe I lines are retrieved at several
center-to-limb positions, reaching adequate S/N after averaging over numerous
similar lines. Retrieved line profile widths and depths are compared to
synthetic ones from models with parameters bracketing those of the target star

strongly depend on the surface granulation structure and much greater
line-width variation is predicted in hotter F-type stars with vigorous
granulation than in cooler K-types. Such parameters, obtained from fits to full
line profiles, are realistic to retrieve for brighter planet-hosting stars,
while their hydrodynamic modeling offers previously unexplored diagnostics for
stellar atmospheric fine structure and 3-D line formation. Precise modeling may
be required in searches for Earth-analog exoplanets around K-type stars, whose
more tranquil surface granulation and lower ensuing microvariability may enable

This paper presents $\texttt{qp}$, a Python package for manipulating

aim of unveiling the physical reasons underlying the radio-loud/radio-quiet

sample of black hole X-ray binaries confirms that being radio-quiet is the more
normal mode of behaviour for black hole binaries. In the light of this we chose
to test, once more, the hypothesis that radio loudness could be a consequence
of the inclination of the X-ray binary. We compared the slope of the
`hard-line' (an approximately linear correlation between X-ray count rate and
rms variability, visible in the hard states of active black holes), the orbital
inclination, and the radio-nature of the sources of our sample. We found that
high-inclination objects show steeper hard-lines than low-inclination objects,
and tend to display a radio-quiet nature (with the only exception of V404 Cyg),
as opposed to low-inclination objects, which appear to be radio-loud(er). While
in need of further confirmation, our results suggest that - contrary to what

generation of generalized Chern-Simons (GCS) couplings. The origin of the GCS

that the DM production cross section triggered by GCS couplings is sufficient
even for an intermediate scale $Z'$ . A large range of DM and Z masses is then
allowed for reasonably high reheating temperature ($T_\rh \gtrsim

constructions, augmenting it by a heavy fermionic spectrum. The latter, when
integrated out, generates the GCS-like terms and provides a new portal to the
dark sector. The presence of a number of derivative couplings in the GCS-like

mechanism has novel consequences and leads to a new reheating dependence of the

driven periodically between such resets, the reset-averaged steady state is

into families by the language of finite element exterior calculus and presented
in the Periodic Table of the Finite Elements. Use of these elements varies,
based principally on the ease or difficulty in finding a ""computational basis""
of shape functions for element families. The tensor product family,
$Q^-_r\Lambda^k$, is most commonly used because computational basis functions
are easy to state and implement. The trimmed and non-trimmed serendipity
families, $S^-_r\Lambda^k$ and $S_r\Lambda^k$ respectively, are used less
frequently because they are newer to the community and, until now, lacked a
straightforward technique for computational basis construction. This represents
a missed opportunity for computational efficiency as the serendipity elements
in general have fewer degrees of freedom than elements of equivalent accuracy
from the tensor product family. Accordingly, in pursuit of easy adoption of the
serendipity families, we present complete lists of computational bases for both
serendipity families, for any order $r\geq 1$ and for any differential form
order $0\leq k\leq n$, for problems in dimension $n=2$ or $3$. The bases are
defined via shared subspace structures, allowing easy comparison of elements
across families. We use and include code in SageMath to find, list, and verify
these computational basis functions.

Lithium ions) are transported in electrolyte solutions under an applied
current. Such systems are typically described by the Planck-Nernst equation in
which the unknown material properties are the diffusion coefficient and the
transference number assumed constant or concentration-dependent. These material
properties can be optimally reconstructed from time- and space-resolved
concentration profiles measured during experiments using the Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) technique. However, since the measurement data is usually noisy,
it is important to quantify how the presence of noise affects the uncertainty
of the reconstructed material properties. We address this problem by developing
a state-of-the-art Bayesian approach to uncertainty quantification in which the
reconstructed material properties are recast in terms of probability
distributions, allowing us to rigorously determine suitable confidence
intervals. The proposed approach is first thoroughly validated using
""manufactured"" data exhibiting the expected behavior as the magnitude of noise
is varied. Then, this approach is applied to quantify the uncertainty of the
diffusion coefficient and the transference number reconstructed from
experimental data revealing interesting insights.

focus on the fundamental setting where the covariates of the uncorrupted
samples are drawn from a Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma)$ on
$\mathbb{R}^d$. We give nearly tight upper bounds and computational lower
bounds for this problem. Specifically, our main contributions are as follows:
  For the case that the covariance matrix is known to be the identity, we give
a sample near-optimal and computationally efficient algorithm that outputs a
candidate hypothesis vector $\widehat{\beta}$ which approximates the unknown
regression vector $\beta$ within $\ell_2$-norm $O(\epsilon \log(1/\epsilon)
\sigma)$, where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the random observation
noise. An error of $\Omega (\epsilon \sigma)$ is information-theoretically
necessary, even with infinite sample size. Prior work gave an algorithm for
this problem with sample complexity $\tilde{\Omega}(d^2/\epsilon^2)$ whose
error guarantee scales with the $\ell_2$-norm of $\beta$.
  For the case of unknown covariance, we show that we can efficiently achieve
the same error guarantee as in the known covariance case using an additional
$\tilde{O}(d^2/\epsilon^2)$ unlabeled examples. On the other hand, an error of
$O(\epsilon \sigma)$ can be information-theoretically attained with
$O(d/\epsilon^2)$ samples. We prove a Statistical Query (SQ) lower bound
providing evidence that this quadratic tradeoff in the sample size is inherent.
More specifically, we show that any polynomial time SQ learning algorithm for
robust linear regression (in Huber's contamination model) with estimation
complexity $O(d^{2-c})$, where $c>0$ is an arbitrarily small constant, must
incur an error of $\Omega(\sqrt{\epsilon} \sigma)$.

Geometrically exact models predict an isola-center bifurcation, indicating that

disappear as the macroscopic strain is increased. This phenomenon has been
verified in experiments. In addition, recent experiments revealed the following
striking phenomenon: For certain aspect ratios for which no wrinkling occurred
upon the first loading, wrinkles appeared during the first unloading and again
during all subsequent cyclic loading. Our goal here is to present a simple
pseudo-elastic model, capturing the stress softening and residual strain
observed in the experiments, that accurately predicts wrinkling behavior on the

complexity, in the sense that it produces an iterate with gradient smaller than

as one of the main drivers of radiation belt dynamics. For moderate wave
intensity, this interaction is well described by quasi-linear theory. However,
recent statistics of parallel propagating chorus waves have demonstrated that
5-20% of the observed waves are sufficiently intense to interact nonlinearly
with electrons. Such interactions include phase trapping and phase bunching
(nonlinear scattering) effects not described by the quasi-linear diffusion. For
sufficiently long (large) wave-packets, these nonlinear effects can result in
very rapid electron acceleration and scattering. In this paper we introduce a
method to include trapping and nonlinear scattering into the kinetic equation
describing the evolution of the electron distribution function. We use
statistics of Van Allen Probes and Time History of Events and Macroscale
Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) observations to determine the
probability distribution of intense, long wave-packets as function of power and
frequency. Then we develop an analytical model of particle resonance of an
individual particle with an intense chorus wave-packet and derive the main
properties of this interaction: probability of electron trapping, energy change
due to trapping and nonlinear scattering. These properties are combined in a
nonlocal operator acting on the electron distribution function. When multiple
waves are present, we average the obtained operator over the observed
distributions of waves and examine solutions of the resultant kinetic equation.
We also examine energy conservation and its implications in systems with the
nonlinear wave-particle interaction.

details gets obscured by large population kinetics at the macroscale,
associating equilibrium pathway to the unravelling landscape. In this work, we
capture evidence of fluctuation energetics with picoliter samples in a
microfluidic cantilever. We exploit nanomechanical resonance to measure the NE
energy exchanges through dissipation, revealing a crucial pre-melting
transition at T~42C . This signifies that unravelling possibly proceeds via
intermediate collapsed-bubble conformations releasing energy, sufficient to
unbind bubble ends, assisting further unbinding. Fluctuation theorem explains
the observations opening further avenues to investigate fluctuation kinetics in
other biological phenomena that also proceed through similar NE energetics.

the artificial implementation of such ""resonate-and-fire"" neurons by utilizing
the magnetization dynamics of a fixed magnetic skyrmion in the free layer of a
magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ). To realize firing of this nanomagnetic
implementation of an artificial neuron, we propose to employ voltage control of
magnetic anisotropy or voltage generated strain as an input (spike or
sinusoidal) signal, which modulates the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy
(PMA). This results in continual expansion and shrinking (i.e. breathing) of a
skyrmion core that mimics the subthreshold oscillation. Any subsequent input
pulse having an interval close to the breathing period or a sinusoidal input
close to the eigen frequency drives the magnetization dynamics of the fixed
skyrmion in a resonant manner. The time varying electrical resistance of the
MTJ layer due to this resonant oscillation of the skyrmion core is used to
drive a Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) buffer circuit, which
produces spike outputs. By rigorous micromagnetic simulation, we investigate
the interspike timing dependence and response to different excitatory and
inhibitory incoming input pulses. Finally, we show that such resonate and fire
neurons have potential application in coupled nanomagnetic oscillator based
associative memory arrays.

behavior and failure to distinguish one's own thoughts and ideas from reality,
has been associated with structural abnormalities in the architecture of
functional brain networks. Using various methods from network analysis, we
examine the effect of two classical therapeutic antipsychotics --- Aripiprazole
and Sulpiride --- on the structure of functional brain networks of healthy
controls and patients who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia. We compare
the community structures of functional brain networks of different individuals
using mesoscopic response functions, which measure how community structure
changes across different scales of a network. We are able to do a reasonably
good job of distinguishing patients from controls, and we are most successful
at this task on people who have been treated with Aripiprazole. We demonstrate
that this increased separation between patients and controls is related only to
a change in the control group, as the functional brain networks of the patient
group appear to be predominantly unaffected by this drug. This suggests that
Aripiprazole has a significant and measurable effect on community structure in
healthy individuals but not in individuals who are diagnosed with
schizophrenia. In contrast, we find for individuals are given the drug
Sulpiride that it is more difficult to separate the networks of patients from
those of controls. Overall, we observe differences in the effects of the drugs
(and a placebo) on community structure in patients and controls and also that
this effect differs across groups. We thereby demonstrate that different types
of antipsychotic drugs selectively affect mesoscale structures of brain
networks, providing support that mesoscale structures such as communities are
meaningful functional units in the brain.

particle-laden flows based on immersed boundary methods, which solve the
Navier-Stokes equations and resolve the particle surfaces. This framework
differs from previous studies by explicitly accounting for the fluid inside the
particles, which is a by-product of the immersed boundary method, allowing us
to close the momentum balance for the flow around a single rolling sphere. We
then compute a momentum balance of a laminar Poiseuille flow over a dense bed
of particles, finding that the stresses remain in equilibrium even during
unsteady flow conditions. While previous studies have focused on stresses for
the streamwise momentum balance, the present approach also allows us to
evaluate stress balances in the vertical direction, which are necessary to
understand the role that collisions and hydrodynamic drag play during dilation
and contraction of particle beds. While our analysis accounts for the fluid and
particle phases separately, we attempt to establish a momentum balance for the
fluid/particle mixture, but find that it does not completely close locally due
to collision stresses not being resolved across the particle diameter. However,
we find a correlation between the local shear rate and the gap in the mixture
balance, which can potentially be used to close the balance for the mixture.

hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae assuming a fallback accretion central
engine. We find that this model can yield good fits to their light curves, with
a fit quality that rivals the popular magnetar engine models. Examining our
derived parameters for the fallback model, we find the total energy
requirements from the accretion disk are estimated to be 0.002 - 0.7 Msun c^2.
If we adopt a typical conversion efficiency ~ 1e-3, the required mass to
accrete is thus 2 - 700 Msun. Many superluminous supernovae, therefore, require
an unrealistic accretion mass, and so only a fraction of these events could be
powered by fallback accretion unless the true efficiency is much greater than
our fiducial value. The superluminous supernovae that require the smallest
amounts of fallback mass still remain to be the fallback accretion powered
supernova candidates, but they are difficult to be distinguished solely by
their light curve properties.

(electron repulsion density, $\rho_{\rm rep}$) and the corresponding optimal
effective potential (electron repulsion potential $v_{\rm rep}$) are obtained
by minimizing the electronic total energy in any density functional
approximation. The two constraints are sufficient to remove the
self-interaction errors from $v_{\rm rep}$, correcting its asymptotic behavior
at large distances from the system. In the present work, we describe, in
complete detail, the constrained minimization method, including recent
refinements. We also assess its performance in removing the self-interaction
errors for three popular density functional approximations, namely LDA, PBE,
and B3LYP, by comparing the obtained ionization energies to their experimental
values for an extended set of molecules. We show that the results of the
constrained minimizations are almost independent of the specific approximation
with average percentage errors 15%, 14%, 13% for the above DFAs respectively.
These errors are substantially smaller than the corresponding errors of the
plain (unconstrained) Kohn-Sham calculations at 38%, 39%, and 27% respectively.

of the location (mean) of the proposals has been largely studied, an important
challenge of AIS relates to the difficulty of adapting the scale parameter

matrix using the empirical covariance results in a singular matrix, which leads
to poor performance in subsequent iterations of the algorithm. In this paper,
we propose a novel scheme which exploits recent advances in the IS literature

significant performance improvement in high-dimensional scenarios. We validate

taken during the low state are presented. We analysed the light-curve and
radial velocity curve and use time-resolved spectroscopy to calculate Doppler
maps of the dominant emission lines. Results. The spectra show narrow emission
lines of Halpha, Hbeta, HeI, NaID, and FeII, as well as faint TiO absorption
bands that trace the motion of the irradiated secondary star, and Halpha and
HeI emission line wings that trace the motion of the white dwarf. From these
radial velocities, we find an orbital period of 3.84 h, and put constraints on
binary parameters such as the mass ratio M2/M1 of 0.43 and the inclination of
15 deg. With a secondary's mass between 0.3 and 0.35 Msol, we derive the mass
for the white dwarf as M1 = 0.6-0.1 Msol.

modulate its predictions to become more uncertain when the model performs
poorly. Building on recent work in provably-safe trajectory planning, we
leverage these confidence-aware human motion predictions to generate assured

and allows for detection, recognition and discrimination of objects in complex
environments. The processes underlying human segmentation of natural images are
still poorly understood. In part, this is because we lack segmentation models
consistent with experimental and theoretical knowledge in visual neuroscience.
Biological sensory systems have been shown to approximate probabilistic
inference to interpret their inputs. This requires a generative model that
captures both the statistics of the sensory inputs and expectations about the
causes of those inputs. Following this hypothesis, we propose a probabilistic
generative model of visual segmentation that combines knowledge about 1) the
sensitivity of neurons in the visual cortex to statistical regularities in
natural images; and 2) the preference of humans to form contiguous partitions
of visual space. We develop an efficient algorithm for training and inference
based on expectation-maximization and validate it on synthetic data.
Importantly, with the appropriate choice of the prior, we derive an intuitive
closed--form update rule for assigning pixels to segments: at each iteration,
the pixel assignment probabilities to segments is the sum of the evidence (i.e.
local pixel statistics) and prior (i.e. the assignments of neighboring pixels)
weighted by their relative uncertainty. The model performs competitively on
natural images from the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset (BSD), and we illustrate
how the likelihood and prior components improve segmentation relative to
traditional mixture models. Furthermore, our model explains some variability
across human subjects as reflecting local uncertainty about the number of
segments. Our model thus provides a viable approach to probe human visual
segmentation.

described by symmetric processes or collective spin operators. We derive
expressions for the reduced density matrix for arbitrary subsystem
decomposition for these states and study properties of permutation symmetric
states and their subsystems when the joint system is picked randomly and
uniformly. Thus defining a new random matrix ensemble, we find the average
linear entropy and von Neumann entropy which implies that random permutation
symmetric states are marginally entangled and as a consequence the tripartite
mutual information (TMI) is typically positive, preventing information from
being shared globally. Applying these results to the quantum kicked top viewed

all increase for large subsystems across the Ehrenfest or log-time and saturate
at the random state values if there is global chaos. During this time the

which O'Kane introduced at the 2008 Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations of
Robotics in order to elegantly illustrate the utility of ignorance. The present
paper reconsiders his formulation and the tracking strategy he proposed, along
with its completeness. We explore how the capabilities of the robot and panda
affect the feasibility of tracking with a privacy stipulation, uncovering
intrinsic limits, no matter the strategy employed. This paper begins with a
one-dimensional setting and, putting the trivially infeasible problems aside,
analyzes the strategy space as a function of problem parameters. We show that
it is not possible to actively track the target as well as protect its privacy
for every nontrivial pair of tracking and privacy stipulations. Secondly,
feasibility can be sensitive, in several cases, to the information available to
the robot initially. Quite naturally in the one-dimensional model, one may
quantify sensing power by the number of perceptual (or output) classes
available to the robot. The robot's power to achieve privacy-preserving
tracking is bounded, converging asymptotically with increasing sensing power.
We analyze the entire space of possible tracking problems, characterizing every
instance as either achievable, constructively by giving a policy where one
exists (some of which depend on the initial information), or proving the
instance impossible. Finally, to relate some of the impossibility results in
one dimension to their higher-dimensional counterparts, including the planar
panda tracking problem studied by O'Kane, we establish a connection between
tracking dimensionality and the sensing power of a one-dimensional robot.

and information theory have revealed phase transitions in a wide array of
high-dimensional statistical problems at two distinct thresholds: One is the
information-theoretical (IT) threshold below which the observation is too noisy
so that inference of the ground truth structure is impossible regardless of the
computational cost; the other is the computational threshold above which
inference can be performed efficiently, i.e., in time that is polynomial in the
input size. In the intermediate regime, inference is information-theoretically
possible, but conjectured to be computationally hard.
  This article provides a survey of the common techniques for determining the
sharp IT and computational limits, using community detection and submatrix
detection as illustrating examples. For IT limits, we discuss tools including
the first and second moment method for analyzing the maximum likelihood
estimator, information-theoretic methods for proving impossibility results
using mutual information and rate-distortion theory, and methods originated
from statistical physics such as interpolation method. To investigate
computational limits, we describe a common recipe to construct a randomized
polynomial-time reduction scheme that approximately maps instances of the
planted clique problem to the problem of interest in total variation distance.

on nonmonotonic logic programs. HEX-programs extend ASP with external atoms for
accessing arbitrary external information, which can introduce values that do
not appear in the input program. In this work we consider inconsistent ASP- and
HEX-programs, i.e., programs without answer sets. We study characterizations of
inconsistency, introduce a novel notion for explaining inconsistencies in terms
of input facts, analyze the complexity of reasoning tasks in context of
inconsistency analysis, and present techniques for computing inconsistency
reasons. This theoretical work is motivated by two concrete applications, which
we also present. The first one is the new modeling technique of query answering
over subprograms as a convenient alternative to the well-known saturation
technique. The second application is a new evaluation algorithm for
HEX-programs based on conflict-driven learning for programs with multiple
components: while for certain program classes previous techniques suffer an
evaluation bottleneck, the new approach shows significant, potentially
exponential speedup in our experiments. Since well-known ASP extensions such as
constraint ASP and DL-programs correspond to special cases of HEX, all
presented results are interesting beyond the specific formalism.

changes in the traditional ways of generation, transmission and distribution of

smart grids. An AMI comprises of systems and networks, that collects and
analyzes data received from smart meters. In addition, AMI also provides
intelligent management of various power-related applications and services based
on the data collected from smart meters. Thus, AMI plays a significant role in
the smooth functioning of smart grids.
  AMI is a privileged target for security attacks as it is made up of systems
that are highly vulnerable to such attacks. Providing security to AMI is
necessary as adversaries can cause potential damage against infrastructures and
privacy in smart grid. One of the most effective and challenging topic's
identified, is the Key Management System (KMS), for sustaining the security
concerns in AMI. Therefore, KMS seeks to be a promising research area for
future development of AMI. This survey work highlights the key security issues
of advanced metering infrastructures and focuses on how key management

main features of advanced metering infrastructures and identify the

problems of interest arise in large-scale learning applications. Our technique
utilizes a curvature-aided gradient tracking step to produce accurate gradient

methods utilizing the new technique, the curvature-aided IAG ({\sf CIAG})
method and the accelerated CIAG ({\sf A-CIAG}) method, which are analogous to
gradient method and Nesterov's accelerated gradient method, respectively.
Setting $\kappa$ to be the condition number of the objective function, we prove
the $R$ linear convergence rates of $1 - \frac{4c_0 \kappa}{(\kappa+1)^2}$ for
the {\sf CIAG} method, and $1 - \sqrt{\frac{c_1}{2\kappa}}$ for the {\sf

the distance between the initial point and the optimal solution. When the
initial iterate is close to the optimal solution, the $R$ linear convergence
rates match with the gradient and accelerated gradient method, albeit {\sf

we extend previous work in the literature and we employ a full emission model
for relativistic reflection in non-Kerr spacetime to demonstrate an approach
that tests the Kerr black hole hypothesis. We analyze a composite spectrum
obtained with the Proportional Counter Array in the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer
(RXTE), of the stellar-mass black hole GX 339-4 in its brightest hard state.
With a remarkable sensitivity of ~0.1% and 40 million counts in the 3-45 keV
band to capture the faint features in the reflection spectrum, we demonstrate
that it is possible with existing data and an adequate model to place
constraints on the black hole spin $a_*$ and the deformation parameter that
quantifies the departure from the Kerr metric. Our measurement obtained with
the best fit model, which should be regarded as principally a proof of concept,
is $a_*=0.92^{+0.07}_{-0.12}$ and $\alpha_{13}=-0.76^{+0.78}_{-0.60}$ with a
90% confidence level and is consistent with the hypothesis that the compact
object in GX 339-4 is a Kerr black hole. We also discuss how the physical model
choice and the emissivity profile adopted could make an impact on the
constraints of $\alpha_{13}$ and spin. To enable Kerr metric test using X-ray
reflection spectroscopy, it is essential to improve our astrophysical
understanding of accreting black holes, e.g., the natures of accretion flow and
corona.

PageRank distribution to variation in damping mechanism is then characterized
analytically, and further estimated quantitatively on 6 large real-world link
graphs. The study leads to new observation and empirical findings. It is found
that the difference in the pattern of PageRank vector responding to parameter
variation by each model among the 6 graphs is relatively smaller than the
difference among 3 particular models used in the study on each of the graphs.
This suggests the utility of model variety for differentiating network
activities and propagation patterns. The quantitative analysis of the damping

highly efficient algorithm, which calculates all PageRank vectors at once via a

framework for better understanding brain and mind disorders. We explore resting
state fMRI data through network measures, and demonstrate that not only is
there a distinctive network architecture in the healthy brain that is disrupted
in schizophrenia, but also that both networks respond to medication. We
construct networks representing 15 healthy individuals and 12 schizophrenia
patients (males and females), all of whom are administered three drug
treatments: (i) a placebo; and two antipsychotic medications (ii) aripiprazole
and; (iii) sulpiride. We first reproduce the established finding that brain
networks of schizophrenia patients exhibit increased efficiency and reduced

drugs. Additionally, we find that aripiprazole considerably alters the network
statistics of healthy controls. Using a test of cognitive ability, we establish
that aripiprazole also adversely affects their performance. This provides
evidence that changes to macroscopic brain network architecture result in
measurable behavioural differences. This is the first time different

an objective methodology with which to calculate and compare the efficacy of

phase with the magnetic activity level. These frequency variations are expected
to be common in solar-type stars and contain information about the
activity-related changes that take place in their interiors. The unprecedented
duration of Kepler photometric time-series provides a unique opportunity to
detect and characterize stellar magnetic cycles through asteroseismology. In
this work, we analyze a sample of 87 solar-type stars, measuring their temporal
frequency shifts over segments of length 90 days. For each segment, the
individual frequencies are obtained through a Bayesian peak-bagging tool. The
mean frequency shifts are then computed and compared with: 1) those obtained
from a cross-correlation method; 2) the variation in the mode heights; 3) a
photometric activity proxy; and 4) the characteristic timescale of the
granulation. For each star and 90-d sub-series, we provide mean frequency
shifts, mode heights, and characteristic timescales of the granulation.
Interestingly, more than 60% of the stars show evidence for (quasi-)periodic
variations in the frequency shifts. In the majority of the cases, these
variations are accompanied by variations in other activity proxies. About 20%
of the stars show mode frequencies and heights varying approximately in phase,
in opposition to what is observed for the Sun.

theory are numerous and include many different sources of intuition, such as
learning theory, sparse signal analysis, physics, chemistry, and psychology. An

scans often produce erroneous results especially in high-field MRI due to the
non-linear and time-varying local magnetic field changes. Recently, it was
shown that the problem of ghost correction can be reformulated as k-space
interpolation problem that can be solved using structured low-rank Hankel
matrix approaches. Another recent work showed that data driven Hankel matrix
decomposition can be reformulated to exhibit similar structures as deep
convolutional neural network. By synergistically combining these findings, we
propose a k-space deep learning approach that immediately corrects the phase
mismatch without a reference scan in both accelerated and non-accelerated EPI
acquisitions. To take advantage of the even and odd-phase directional
redundancy, the k-space data is divided into two channels configured with even
and odd phase encodings. The redundancies between coils are also exploited by
stacking the multi-coil k-space data into additional input channels. Then, our
k-space ghost correction network is trained to learn the interpolation kernel
to estimate the missing virtual k-space data. For the accelerated EPI data, the
same neural network is trained to directly estimate the interpolation kernels
for missing k-space data from both ghost and subsampling. Reconstruction
results using 3T and 7T in-vivo data showed that the proposed method
outperformed the image quality compared to the existing methods, and the
computing time is much faster.The proposed k-space deep learning for EPI ghost
correction is highly robust and fast, and can be combined with acceleration, so
that it can be used as a promising correction tool for high-field MRI without

test quantum theory in a complementary way to the Bell and Leggett-Garg tests.

possible sources for ground-based gravitational wave detectors, and are
expected to form through dynamical scattering and multi-body interactions in
globular clusters and galactic nuclei. In contrast to black holes, oscillations
of neutron stars are generically excited by tidal effects after close
pericenter passage. Depending on the equation of state, this can enhance the
loss of orbital energy by up to tens of percent over that radiated away by
gravitational waves during an orbit. Under the same interaction mechanism, part
of the orbital angular momentum is also transferred to the star. We calculate
the impact of the neutron star oscillations on the orbital evolution of such
systems, and compare these results to full numerical simulations. Utilizing a
Post-Newtonian flux description we propose a preliminary model to predict the
timing of different pericenter passages. A refined version of this model
(taking into account Post-Newtonian corrections to the tidal coupling and the
oscillations of the stars) may serve as a waveform model for such highly

integration is often achieved by using the unbiased Monte Carlo estimator, but
the variances of the estimation are generally high in many applications.
Control variates approaches are well-known to reduce the variance of the
estimation. These control variates are typically constructed by employing
predefined parametric functions or polynomials, determined by using those
samples drawn from the relevant distributions. Instead, we propose to construct
those control variates by learning neural networks to handle the cases when
test functions are complex. In many applications, obtaining a large number of
samples for Monte Carlo estimation is expensive, which may result in
overfitting when training a neural network. We thus further propose to employ
auxiliary random variables induced by the original ones to extend data samples
for training the neural networks. We apply the proposed control variates with
augmented variables to thermodynamic integration and reinforcement learning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve significant
variance reduction compared with other alternatives.

One of the crucial tasks in CR is to sample wideband signal at high sampling

technique for wideband sparse signals, which occupy a small part of band range.
In this proposed acquisition receiver, we use two low speed analog-to-digital
converters (ADCs) to capture a common sparse multiband signal, whose band
locations are unknown. The two ADCs are synchronously clocked at co-prime
sampling rates. The obtained samples are re-sequenced into a group of uniform

the frequency domain and present its signal reconstruction algorithm. Compared
to the existing sub-Nyquist sampling techniques, such as multi-coset sampling
and modulated wideband converter, the proposed approach has a simple system
architecture and can be implemented with only two samplers. Experimental
results are reported to demonstrate the feasibility and advantage of the
proposed model. For sparse multiband signal with unknown spectral support, the
proposed system requires a sampling rate much lower than Nyquist rate, while

radiative heating of the atmosphere during the burst rise, and the launch and
evolution of the optically thick radiation-driven wind as the photosphere
expands outward to radii $r_{\rm ph} \gtrsim 100\text{ km}$. We focus on
neutron stars (NSs) accreting pure helium and study bursts over a range of
ignition depths. We find that the wind ejects $\approx 0.2\%$ of the accreted
layer, nearly independent of ignition depth. This implies that $\approx 30\%$
of the nuclear energy release is used to unbind matter from the NS surface. We
show that ashes of nuclear burning are ejected in the wind and dominate the
wind composition for bursts that ignite at column depths $\gtrsim 10^9\text{ g
cm}^{-2}$. The ejecta are composed primarily of elements with mass numbers $A>
40$, which we find should imprint photoionization edges on the burst spectra.
Evidence of heavy-element edges has been reported in the spectra of strong,
radius-expansion bursts. We find that after $\approx 1\text{ s}$ the wind
composition transitions from mostly light elements ($^4$He and $^{12}$C), which
sit at the top of the atmosphere, to mostly heavy elements ($A>40$), which sit
deeper down. This may explain why the photospheric radii of all superexpansion

for training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) namely LSTMs. We show that the
mapping of recurrent layers is very similar to the mapping of fully connected
layers and therefore the RPU concept can potentially provide large acceleration
factors for RNNs as well. In addition, we study the effect of various device
imperfections and system parameters on training performance. Symmetry of
updates becomes even more crucial for RNNs; already a few percent asymmetry
results in an increase in the test error compared to the ideal case trained
with floating point numbers. Furthermore, the input signal resolution to device
arrays needs to be at least 7 bits for successful training. However, we show
that a stochastic rounding scheme can reduce the input signal resolution back
to 5 bits. Further, we find that RPU device variations and hardware noise are
enough to mitigate overfitting, so that there is less need for using dropout.
We note that the models trained here are roughly 1500 times larger than the
fully connected network trained on MNIST dataset in terms of the total number

$N$-body planet formation models. The first of these planet formation models
simulates what is termed the ""Classical"" case wherein Jupiter and Saturn are
kept in their current orbits. We compare these results with another model based
on the ""Grand Tack"", in which Jupiter and Saturn migrate through the primordial
asteroid belt. Our estimate of the average fraction of chondrite assembled into
Earth and Mars assumes that the initial solid disk consists of only sources of
enstatite chondrite composition in the inner region, and ordinary chondrite in
the outer region. Results of these analyses show that both models tend to yield
Earth and Mars analogues whose accretion zones overlap. The Classical case
fares better in forming Mars with its documented composition (29% to 68%
enstatite chondrite plus 32% to 67% ordinary chondrite) though the Mars
analogues are generally too massive. However, if we include the restriction of

distribution system has a significant impact on the secret key rate and
transmission distance of the system. Currently, the postprocessing mainly
contains four steps in the following order: sifting, parameter estimation,
information reconciliation, and privacy amplification. For a quantum channel
with unknown prior characteristics, part of the raw keys (typically half) have
to be sacrificed to estimate the channel parameters, which is used to assist in
error correction (part of information reconciliation) and estimate the secret
key rate. This introduces a tradeoff between the secret key rate and the
accuracy of parameter estimation when considering the finite-size effect. In
this paper, we propose a high efficiency postprocessing method which uses all
the raw keys for both parameter estimation and key extraction. It is realized
by exchanging the order of parameter estimation and information reconciliation,
while the other steps remain unchanged. After the sifting step, the extra data
(used for phase compensation and synchronization etc) can be used to roughly
estimate the quantum channel parameters, or using the estimated results of last
block, thus the error correction can be realized normally. After the success of
error correction, the reconciler recovers the raw keys of the other side by a
reverse mapping function. Then she uses all the raw keys of both sides for
parameter estimation to estimate the quantum channel parameters and calculate
the secret key rate of the system. Finally, they perform the privacy
amplification step to obtain the unconditional security keys. We show that this
method improves the accuracy of parameter estimation and the secret key rate of

at models with non-differentiable densities. One of the key challenges in
stochastic variational inference is to come up with a low-variance estimator of
the gradient of a variational objective. We tackle the challenge by
generalizing the reparameterization trick, one of the most effective techniques
for addressing the variance issue for differentiable models, so that the trick
works for non-differentiable models as well. Our algorithm splits the space of
latent variables into regions where the density of the variables is
differentiable, and their boundaries where the density may fail to be
differentiable. For each differentiable region, the algorithm applies the
standard reparameterization trick and estimates the gradient restricted to the
region. For each potentially non-differentiable boundary, it uses a form of
manifold sampling and computes the direction for variational parameters that,
if followed, would increase the boundary's contribution to the variational
objective. The sum of all the estimates becomes the gradient estimate of our
algorithm. Our estimator enjoys the reduced variance of the reparameterization
gradient while remaining unbiased even for non-differentiable models. The
experiments with our preliminary implementation confirm the benefit of reduced
variance and unbiasedness.

of the complexity of the function computed by a neural network that is based on
the magnitude of the gradient. Via an extensive empirical study, we show that
the NLC is a powerful predictor of test error and that attaining a right-sized
NLC is essential for optimal performance.
  The NLC exhibits a range of intriguing and important properties. It is
closely tied to the amount of information gained from computing a single
network gradient. It is tied to the error incurred when replacing the
nonlinearity operations in the network with linear operations. It is not
susceptible to the confounders of multiplicative scaling, additive bias and
layer width. It is stable from layer to layer. Hence, we argue that the NLC is
the first robust predictor of overfitting in deep networks.

these redshifts. The brightest quasar in BlueTides has a luminosity of a $\sim$
few $10^{13} L_{\odot}$ and a black hole mass of $6.4 \times 10^{8} M_{\odot}$
at $z \sim 7.5$, comparable to the observed quasar (the only one in this large

with an ongoing (intrinsic) star formation rate of $\sim 80 M_{\odot} yr^{-1}$.
The corresponding intrinsic UV magnitude of the galaxy is $-23.1$, which is
roughly $2.7$ magnitudes fainter than the quasar's magnitude of $-25.9$. We
find that the galaxy is highly metal enriched with a mean metallicity equal to
the solar value. We derive quasar and galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED)
in the mid and near infrared JWST bands. We predict a significant amount of
dust attenuation in the rest-frame UV corresponding to $A_{1500} \sim 1.7$

images of the galaxy with and without central point source, in different MIRI

extremely compact ($R_{E}=0.35$ kpc). It will require JWST's exquisite
sensitivity and resolution to separate the galaxy from the central point
source. Finally within the FOV of the quasar in BlueTides there are two more
sources that would be detectable by JWST.

Numerous methods, datasets and evaluation metrics have been proposed in the

surveying the state of the art approaches with a focus on deep learning models;

characterization. It helps in identifying the various lithological and

of seismic data or number of attributes to be analyzed, the manual process for
facies identification becomes complicated and time-consuming. Even though
seismic attributes add multiple dimensions to the data, their role in reservoir
characterization is very crucial. There exist different linear transformation
methods that use seismic attributes for identification, characterization, and
visualization of seismic facies. These linear transformation methods have been
widely used for facies characterization. However, there are some limitations
associated with these methods such as deciding the width parameters, number of
clusters, convergence rate etc. Therefore, the present research work uses
non-linear transformation approach that overcomes some of the major limitations

attributes viz. energy, homogeneity, contrast, and dissimilarity. The
Generative Topographic Map(GTM) is used for unsupervised classification of
seismic facies based on the set of calculated texture attributes. Further, the
present work uses Radial Basis Function(RBF) for interpolating the missing
values in the data.

Accepted to TPAMI",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Data for face analysis often exhibit highly-skewed class distribution, i.e.,
most data belong to a few majority classes, while the minority classes only
contain a scarce amount of instances. To mitigate this issue, contemporary deep
learning methods typically follow classic strategies such as class re-sampling
or cost-sensitive training. In this paper, we conduct extensive and systematic
experiments to validate the effectiveness of these classic schemes for
representation learning on class-imbalanced data. We further demonstrate that
more discriminative deep representation can be learned by enforcing a deep
network to maintain inter-cluster margins both within and between classes. This
tight constraint effectively reduces the class imbalance inherent in the local
data neighborhood, thus carving much more balanced class boundaries locally. We
show that it is easy to deploy angular margins between the cluster
distributions on a hypersphere manifold. Such learned Cluster-based Large
Margin Local Embedding (CLMLE), when combined with a simple k-nearest cluster
algorithm, shows significant improvements in accuracy over existing methods on
both face recognition and face attribute prediction tasks that exhibit
imbalanced class distribution.

introduce chord conditioning, which allows all of these operations to be
performed while keeping harmony fixed, and allows chords to be changed while

from either bulk single crystal TiSe$_2$ or TiSe$_2$ thin films on graphene.
The epitaxial TiSe$_2$ thin films can be prepared on TiO$_2$ via molecular beam
epitaxy (MBE) in two ways: by conventional co-deposition using selenium and
titanium sources, and by evaporating only selenium on reconstructed TiO$_2$
surfaces. Both growth methods yield atomically flat thin films with similar

order can be explained by selenium vacancies in the TiSe$_2$ film, which
naturally occur when TiO$_2$ substrates are used. This is due to the stronger
interfacial bonding that changes the ideal growth conditions. Our finding

inelastic electron scattering theory by way of Monte Carlo simulations of
independent electron trajectories. However, in practice the method can only be
applied for ideally smooth surfaces and thin films, not representative of real
material surfaces. Recently, micro-architected surfaces with nanometric
features have been proposed to mitigate SEE and ion-induced erosion in
plasma-exposed thruster linings. In this paper, we propose an approach for
calculating secondary electron yields from surfaces with arbitrarily-complex
geometries using an extension of the \emph{ray tracing} Monte Carlo (RTMC)
technique. We study nanofoam structures with varying porosities as
representative micro-architected surfaces, and use RTMC to generate primary
electron trajectories and track secondary electrons until their escape from the
outer surface. Actual surfaces are represented as a discrete finite element
meshes obtained from X-ray tomography images of tungsten nanofoams. At the
local level, primary rays impinging into surface elements produce daughter rays
of secondary electrons whose number, energies and angular characteristics are
set by pre-calculated tables of SEE yields and energies from ideally-flat
surfaces. We find that these micro-architected geometries can reduce SEE by up
to 50\% with respect to flat surfaces depending on porosity and primary
electron energy.

reinforcement mechanism that learns to incentivize high-quality data
sequentially and requires no such prior assumptions. Specifically, we first
design a Gibbs sampling augmented Bayesian inference algorithm to estimate
workers' labeling strategies from the collected labels at each step. Then we
propose a reinforcement incentive learning (RIL) method, building on top of the
above estimates, to uncover how workers respond to different payments. RIL
dynamically determines the payment without accessing any ground-truth labels.
We theoretically prove that RIL is able to incentivize rational workers to
provide high-quality labels. Empirical results show that our mechanism performs
consistently well under both rational and non-fully rational (adaptive
learning) worker models. Besides, the payments offered by RIL are more robust
and have lower variances compared to the existing one-shot mechanisms.

first-principles modeling techniques, supported by powerful experimental
methods. However, much less attention has been paid to the effect of different
naturally occurring interstitials on the thermal and electrical properties of
silicon. In this work, we present a systematic study of the variability of heat
and charge transport properties of bulk silicon, in the presence of randomly
distributed interstitial defects (Si, Ge, C and Li). We find through atomistic
lattice dynamics and molecular dynamics modeling studies that, interstitial
defects scatter heat-carrying phonons to suppress thermal transport-1.56% of
randomly distributed Ge and Li interstitials reduce the thermal conductivity of

functional theory and semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory, we compute
electronic transport coefficients of bulk Si with 1.56% Ge, C, Si and Li
interstitials, in hexagonal, tetrahedral, split-interstitial and bond-centered
sites. We demonstrate that hexagonal-Si and hexagonal-Ge interstitials
minimally impact charge transport. To complete the study, we predict the
thermoelectric property of an experimentally realizable bulk Si sample that
contains Ge interstitials in different symmetry sites. Our research establishes
a direct relationship between the variability of structures dictated by
fabrication processes and heat and charge transport properties of silicon. The
relationship provides guidance to accurately estimate performance of Si-based
materials for various technological applications.

braneworld black holes, we investigate their microlensing phenomena and shadows
and discuss how to distinguish them from standard Schwarzschild black holes and
Ellis wormholes. Microlensing is known as the phenomenon in which luminosity
amplification appears when a bright object passes behind a black hole or
another massive object. We find that, for the braneworld black hole as well as
for the Ellis wormhole, there appears luminosity reduction just before and
after the amplification. This means that observation of such a reduction would
indicate the lens object is either a braneworld black hole or a wormhole,
though it is difficult to distinguish one from the other by microlensing
solely. Therefore, we next analyze the optical images, or shadows of the
braneworld black hole surrounded by optically thin dust, and compare them to
those of the Ellis wormhole. Because the spacetime around the braneworld black
hole possesses unstable circular orbits of photons, a bright ring appears in
the image, just as in Schwarzschild spacetime or in the wormhole spacetime.
This indicates that the appearance of a bright ring does not solely confirm a
braneworld black hole, a Schwarzschild, nor an Ellis wormhole. However, we find
that only for the wormhole is the intensity inside the ring larger than that
the outsider intensity. Therefore, with future high-resolution observations of
microlensing and shadows together, we could identify the braneworld black holes

started due to the low height magnetic reconnection of emerging magnetic flux
with super-penumbral field resulting hot multi-temperature plasma flows in the
inverse Evershed flow channel and its overlying atmosphere. The inverse
Evershed flows in the chromosphere start from super penumbra towards sunspot
that end at the outer boundary of the penumbra. The hot plasma flow towards the
sunspot in the inverse Evershed channels show about 10 km s$^{-1}$ higher
velocity in H$\alpha$ wavelengths compared to the plasma emissions at various
temperatures as seen in different AIA filters. Even though these velocities are
about seven times higher than the typical inverse-Evershed flow speeds, the
flow is diminished at the outer boundary of the sunspot's penumbra. This
suggests that the super-penumbral field lines that carry the inverse Evershed
flows, are discontinued at the boundary where the penumbral field lines dive
into the sun and these two sets of field lines are completely distinct. The
discontinuity in the typical magnetic field and plasma properties at the
adjoining of these two sets of field lines further leads the discontinuity in
the characteristic magnetoacoustic and Alfv\'en speeds, therefore, stopping the
plasma flows further on. The multi-temperature plasma in the inverse Evershed
channels exhibits \textbf{possible} longitudinal oscillations initially during
the onset of the flare, and later flows towards the sunspot. In the

PIR scheme was proposed. In this paper, the star product scheme is adopted,
with appropriate modifications, to the case of private (e.g., video) streaming.
It is assumed that the files to be streamed are stored on~$n$ servers in a
coded form, and the streaming is carried out via a convolutional code. The star
product scheme is defined for this special case, and various properties are
analyzed for two channel models related to straggling and Byzantine servers,
both in the baseline case as well as with colluding servers. The achieved PIR
rates for the given models are derived and, for the cases where the capacity is
known, the first model is shown to be asymptotically optimal, when the number
of stripes in a file is large. The second scheme introduced in this work is
shown to be the equivalent of block convolutional codes in the PIR setting. For

that the angular distributions behave differently in the Nd-rich and Fe-rich

increasing the Nd ratio, which corresponds to the appearance of crystalline

the slotted ALOHA protocol, which is the preferred protocol for simple and

broadcasts radio frequency energy to the EH users (EHUs). The EHUs harvest the
broadcasted energy and use it to transmit information back to the base station
by contending for access to the uplink channel in the random access (RA) phase.
In order to ensure fairness among the users, we propose a proportionally fair
resource allocation scheme that exploits the RA nature of slotted ALOHA.
Specifically, assuming statistical channel state information, we determine the
optimal transmit power at the base station, the optimal durations of the EH and
RA phases, the channel access probability, and the rate of each EHU.

those that have relatively low fluxes and high values for the low energy
cut-off. While electron beams shift the upper chromosphere and transition
region to greater geometrical heights, proton beams with a similar flux leave
these areas of the atmosphere relatively undisturbed. It is easier for proton
beams to penetrate to the deeper layers and not deposit their energy in the
upper chromosphere where the Balmer lines are formed. The relatively weak
particle beams that are applicable to this flare do not cause a significant
shift of the $\tau=1$ surface and the observed excess WL emission is optically
thin.

Analysis (AVCA) attempts to generate a direct mapping between video content and
the corresponding affective states such as arousal and valence dimensions. Most
existing studies establish the mapping for each dimension separately using
knowledge-based rules or traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine
(SVM). The inherent correlations between affective dimensions have largely been
unexploited, which are anticipated to include important information for

presents an approach to predict arousal and valance dimensions synchronously

synchronously into pairs of arousal and valence values using the LSTM network

solve convex programming problems with two-block separable linear constraints
and objectives, whereby (at least) one of the components of the latter is
assumed to be strongly convex. The fact that one of the subproblems to be
solved within the iteration process of AMA does not usually correspond to the
calculation of a proximal operator through a closed formula, affects the
implementability of the algorithm. In this paper we allow in each block of the
objective a further smooth convex function and propose a proximal version of
AMA, called Proximal AMA, which is achieved by equipping the algorithm with
proximal terms induced by variable metrics. For suitable choices of the latter,
the solving of the two subproblems in the iterative scheme can be reduced to

use neural networks to implement potential functions in random fields (a.k.a.

progress. Different from various directed graphical models such as generative
adversarial networks (GANs), NRFs provide an interesting family of undirected

Based on the new approach, specific inclusive-NRF models are developed and
thoroughly evaluated in two important generative modeling applications - image

state-of-the-art results in both applications. Remarkably, in addition to
superior sample generation, one additional benefit of our inclusive-NRF

paper significantly advances the learning and applications of NRFs to a new

environment limited as prescribed by the researcher. It is thus a potent tool
for laboratory evolution - selecting for strains with desired phenotypes.
However, despite the apparently simple design governed by a limited set of
rules, analysis of chemostat dynamics shows that they display counter-intuitive
properties. For example, the concentration of limiting substrate in the
chemostat is independent of the concentration in the influx and only dependent
on the dilution rate and the strain parameters. Moreover, choosing optimal
operational parameters (dilution rate, volume size, etc.) can be challenging.
There are conflicting requirements in the experimental design, such as a need
for relatively fast growth conditions for mutation accumulation on the one hand
versus slow dilution for a large fitness advantage for mutants to take over the
population quickly on the other.In this study, we provide analytic and
computational tools to help understand and predict chemostat dynamics, and
choose suitable operational parameters. We refer to five stages of the process:
(A) parameter choice and setup, (B) basic steady state growth, (C) mutation,
(D) single takeover and (E) successive takeovers. We present a qualitative and
quantitative framework to answer the questions confronted in each of these
stages. We provide a set of simulations which support the quantitative results,
and a graphical user interface to give a hands-on opportunity to experience and
visualize the analytic results. We detail conditions that produce ineffectual
selection regimes, and find that when avoided, the selection time is relatively
robust, and usually varies by less than an order of magnitude. Finally, we
suggest rules of thumb to help ensure that the chosen parameters lead to
effective selection and minimize the duration of the selection process.

recording into a novel form of log-frequency spectrogram whose resolution
exceeds that of the mel spectrogram. We then make use of the pitch-invariant
properties of that representation in order to identify the sounds of the
instruments via the same sparse pursuit method. As the model parameters which

dictionary that contains them, using a modified version of Adam. Applying the
algorithm on various audio samples, we find that it is capable of producing
high-quality separation results when the model assumptions are satisfied and
the instruments are clearly distinguishable, but combinations of instruments
with similar spectral characteristics pose a conceptual difficulty. While a key
feature of the model is that it explicitly models inharmonicity, its presence
can also still impede performance of the sparse pursuit algorithm. In general,
due to its pitch-invariance, our method is especially suitable for dealing with
spectra from acoustic instruments, requiring only a minimal number of
hyperparameters to be preset. Additionally, we demonstrate that the dictionary
that is constructed for one recording can be applied to a different recording

System (DNS) lookup for the destination server that the client wants to

for example, indicates that DNS queries reveal information ranging from web
browsing activity to the types of devices that a user has in their home.
Recognizing the privacy vulnerabilities associated with DNS queries, various
third parties have created alternate DNS services that obscure a user's DNS
queries from his or her Internet service provider. Yet, these systems merely
transfer trust to a different third party. We argue that no single party ought
to be able to associate DNS queries with a client IP address that issues those

additional layer of obfuscation between clients and their queries. To do so,
ODNS uses its own authoritative namespace; the authoritative servers for the
ODNS namespace act as recursive resolvers for the DNS queries that they
receive, but they never see the IP addresses for the clients that initiated
these queries. We present an initial deployment of ODNS; our experiments show
that ODNS introduces minimal performance overhead, both for individual queries

Nasiri, Reshad Hosseini, and Hadi Moradi","A Recursive Least Square Method for 3D Pose Graph Optimization Problem",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pose Graph Optimization (PGO) is an important non-convex optimization problem
and is the state-of-the-art formulation for SLAM in robotics. It also has
applications like camera motion estimation, structure from motion and 3D
reconstruction in machine vision. Recent researches have shown the importance
of good initialization to bootstrap well-known iterative PGO solvers to
converge to good solutions. The state-of-the-art initialization methods,
however, works in low noise or eventually moderate noise problems, and they
fail in challenging problems with high measurement noise. Consequently,
iterative methods may get entangled in local minima in high noise scenarios. In
this paper we present an initialization method which uses orientation
measurements and then present a convergence analysis of our iterative
algorithm. We show how the algorithm converges to global optima in noise-free
cases and also obtain a bound for the difference between our result and the
optimum solution in scenarios with noisy measurements. We then present our
second algorithm that uses both relative orientation and position measurements
to obtain a more accurate least squares approximation of the problem that is
again solved iteratively. In the convergence proof, a structural coefficient
arises that has important influence on the basin of convergence. Interestingly,
simulation results show that this coefficient also affects the performance of
other solvers and so it can indicate the complexity of the problem.
Experimental results show the excellent performance of the proposed
initialization algorithm, specially in high noise scenarios.

interest for several decades. In this work, we employ a Green's function based
approach, namely the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA), to investigate
phonons in mass disordered systems. Detailed benchmarks with previous exact
calculations are used to validate the method in a wide parameter space. An
extension of the method, namely the typical medium DCA (TMDCA), is used to
study Anderson localization of phonons in three dimensions. We show that, for
binary isotopic disorder, lighter impurities induce localized modes beyond the
bandwidth of the host system, while heavier impurities lead to a partial
localization of the low-frequency acoustic modes. For a uniform (box)
distribution of masses, the physical spectrum is shown to develop long tails
comprising mostly localized modes. The mobility edge separating extended and
localized modes, obtained through the TMDCA, agrees well with results from the
transfer matrix method. A re-entrance behavior of the mobility edge with
increasing disorder is found that is similar to, but somewhat more pronounced
than, the behavior in disordered electronic systems. Our work establishes a new
computational approach, which recovers the thermodynamic limit, is versatile
and computationally inexpensive, to investigate lattice vibrations in
disordered lattice systems.

that, for non-smooth functions, while the dominant term of the error is in

second-order term in $O(1/t)$, where $t$ is time. In other words, the error due
to limits in communication resources decreases at a fast rate even in the case
of non-strongly-convex objective functions. Under the global regularity

perpendicular magnetized systems to adopt a homochiral configuration by winding
in the same direction for both Up-Down and Down-Up walls. The topology of these
domain walls is then distinct from the uniformly magnetized state. When two
domain walls approach each other and are in close proximity they form winding
pairs, stabilized by a dipolar repulsion. This can result in the formation of
360 {\deg} stable domain walls, whose stability is directly related to the
magnitude of the additional dipolar interaction resulting from the spin
structure governed by the DMI. Application of an external magnetic field can
overcome the dipolar repulsion of the winding pairs and result in the
annihilation of the domain walls, which is studied here in a combined
theoretical and experimental effort. We present an extended analytical model
that studies the interaction and modification of the dipolar interaction of the
domain wall pairs under the application of in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic
fields. We realize the experiment in a system of
Ta/Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$/MgO and observe that the results are in agreement
with the behavior predicted by the analytical model. To compare and understand
these results, we perform micromagnetic calculations to gauge the validity of
the analytics and also include the full dipolar interactions which are present
due to the device geometry. We find that our numerical and experimental studies
are in agreement and that the DMI indeed provides an additional stability
mechanism against annihilation of DWs, which is potentially useful in dense
memory storage applications. Beyond implications for domain walls,
understanding the interaction is an important step to understand and control
the interaction of many spin structures that contain domain walls, such as
skyrmions.

operators such as hypermutations and ageing can be very efficient at escaping
local optima of multimodal optimisation problems. However, this efficiency
comes at the expense of considerably slower runtimes during the exploitation
phase compared to standard evolutionary algorithms. We propose modifications to
the traditional `hypermutations with mutation potential' (HMP) that allow them
to be efficient at exploitation as well as maintaining their effective
explorative characteristics. Rather than deterministically evaluating fitness
after each bitflip of a hypermutation, we sample the fitness function
stochastically with a `parabolic' distribution which allows the `stop at first
constructive mutation' (FCM) variant of HMP to reduce the linear amount of
wasted function evaluations when no improvement is found to a constant. By
returning the best sampled solution during the hypermutation, rather than the
first constructive mutation, we then turn the extremely inefficient HMP
operator without FCM, into a very effective operator for the standard Opt-IA

sensitivity to the $\phi$ meson and secondary neutron in-medium mass shifts at
$\phi$ momenta studied in the HADES experiment. On the other hand, we show that
there are measurable changes in the transparency ratio due to the ${\phi}N$

H2O and OH) and atomic coolants (e.g. [OI]). Molecular lines are mainly exited
at the terminal bowshocks of the outflow and around the position of the
protostar. All lines show maxima at the southeast bowshock with the exception
of water emission that peaks around the central source. Excitation analysis in
all positions shows that CO and H$_2$O are mainly thermally excited at T~ 350 K
and 90 K respectively, with the CO showing a second temperature component at
750 K towards the southeast peak. Excitation analysis breaks down in the case
of OH, indicating that the molecule is non-thermally excited. Comparisons
between the CO and H2 column densities suggest that the CO abundance value in
shocks can be up to an order of magnitude lower than the canonical value of
10$^{-4}$. The water ortho-to-para ratio around the protostar is only 0.65,
indicating low-temperature water ice formation followed by non-destructive
photodesorption from the dust grains. Therefore the low ortho-to-para ratio in
water that can be interpreted in terms of formation from a primordial gas
reservoir in the protostellar envelope. The two-sided total atomic mass flux
estimated from the [OI] jet sums to 1.65$\times 10^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$,
a value that is very close to the mass flux previously estimated for the SiO
jet and the H$_2$ outflow. These comparisons render HH211 the first embedded
system where an atomic jet is demonstrably shown to possess enough momentum to
drive the observed molecular jets and large scale outflows.

about their formation. It is believed that these planets formed in the outer
regions of the disc and then migrated through planet-disc interaction to their
current location. Considering five different systems (Kepler-16, -34, -35, -38
and -413) we model planet migration through the disc, with special focus on the
final orbital elements of the planets. We investigate how the final orbital
parameters are influenced by the disc and planet masses. Using 2D, locally
isothermal, viscous hydrodynamical simulations we first model the disc dynamics
for all five systems, followed by a study of the migration properties of
embedded planets with different masses. For all systems we find that the discs
become eccentric and precess slowly. We confirm the bifurcation feature in the
precession period -- gap-size diagram for different binary mass ratios. The
Kepler-16, -35, -38 and -413 systems lie on the lower branch and Kepler-34 on
the upper one. For systems with small binary eccentricity we find a new
non-monotonic, loop-like feature. In all systems the planets migrate to the
inner edge of the disc cavity. Depending on the planet-disc mass ratio we
observe two different regimes. Massive planets can significantly alter the disc
structure by compressing and circularising the inner cavity and they remain on
nearly circular orbits. Lower mass planets are strongly influenced by the disc,
their eccentricity is exited to high values, and their orbits are aligned with
the inner disc in a state of apsidal corotation. In our simulations the final
locations of the planets are typically too large with respect to the
observations because of the large inner gaps of the discs. The migrating
planets in the most eccentric discs (around Kepler-34 and -413) show the
largest final eccentricity in agreement with the observations.

existence of multiple GC populations associated with NGC 1316, where the

Compared to existing functionals, TT-$\omega$PBEh manages to provide more
accurate predictions for key spectroscopic and photochemical observables,
including but not limited to $E_{\rm T}$, $E_{\rm S}$, $\Delta E_{\rm ST}$, and
$I$, as it adjusts the effective electron-hole interactions to arrive at the
correct excitation energies. This promising triplet tuning scheme can be
applied to a broad range of systems that were notorious in DFT for being
extremely challenging.

groups). Moreover, we will rule out right character amenability. The crucial
underlying nonnegative linearization property will be established, too, which
particularly establishes a conjecture of R. Lasser (1994). Furthermore, we

that involves training a simple recurrent neural network model to produce

  We test our method on the task of detecting hip fractures from frontal pelvic

text containing elements that the original deep learning classification model
was not specifically trained to detect.
  The experimental results show that: 1) the sentences produced by our method

preferred by doctors compared to current tools that create saliency maps, and
3) the combination of visualisations and generated text is better than either

as a definable retract of $\tau$: that is, when there are $\lambda$-terms
$e:\sigma\rightarrow\tau$ and $d:\tau\rightarrow\sigma$ with $d \circ e = id$.
In general, the answer to this question may vary according to both the choice
of $\lambda$-calculus and the notion of equality considered; however, we shall
show that the encodability relation $\preceq$ between types actually remains
stable across a large class of languages and equality relations, ranging from a
very basic language with infinitely many distinguishable constants $0,1,\ldots$
(but no arithmetic) considered modulo computational equality, up to the whole
of Plotkin's PCF considered modulo observational equivalence. We show that
$\sigma \preceq \tau \preceq \sigma$ iff $\sigma \cong \tau$ via trivial
isomorphisms, and that for any $\sigma,\tau$ we have either $\sigma \preceq
\tau$ or $\tau \preceq \sigma$. Furthermore, we show that the induced linear
order on isomorphism classes of types is actually a well-ordering of type
$\epsilon_0$, and indeed that there is a close syntactic correspondence between
simple types and Cantor normal forms for ordinals below $\epsilon_0$. This
means that the relation $\preceq$ is readily decidable, and that terms
witnessing a retraction $\sigma \lhd \tau$ are readily constructible when
$\sigma \preceq \tau$ holds.

of a range of Leishmania swimming scenarios demonstrate an absence of stable
boundary motility for an idealised model promastigote near passive or repulsive
surfaces, with behaviours ranging from boundary capture to deflection into the
bulk. Indeed, the inclusion of a repulsive surface force results in the
deflection of all surface-bound promastigotes, suggesting that the documented
surface detachment of infective metacyclic promastigotes may be the result of
morphological adaptation and simple hydrodynamics. Further, simulation
elucidates a remarkable morphology-dependent hydrodynamic mechanism of boundary
approach, hypothesised to be the cause of the well-established phenomenon of
tip-first epithelial attachment of Leishmania promastigotes to the sandfly
vector midgut.

fluid-structure interaction (FSI) systems under both laminar and turbulent flow
conditions. Of particular interest is to provide the significance of
low-dimensional wake flow features and their interaction dynamics to sustain
the free vibration of a square cylinder at a relatively low mass ratio. To
obtain the high-dimensional data, we employ a body-conforming variational
fluid-structure interaction solver based on the recently developed partitioned
iterative scheme and the dynamic subgrid-scale turbulence model for a moderate
Reynolds number. The snapshot data from high-dimensional FSI simulations are
projected to a low-dimensional subspace using the proper orthogonal
decomposition (POD). We utilize each corresponding POD mode for detecting
features: the vortex street, the shear layer and the near-wake bubble. We find
that the vortex shedding modes contribute solely to the lift force, while the
near-wake and shear layer modes play a dominating role to the drag force. We
further examine the fundamental mechanism of this dynamical behavior and
propose a force decomposition technique via low-dimensional approximation. We
ascertain quantitatively that the shear layer feeds the vorticity flux to the
wake vortices and the near-wake bubble during the wake-body synchronization.
Based on the decomposition of wake dynamics, we suggest an interaction cycle
for the frequency lock-in during the wake-body interaction, which provides the
inter-relationship between the high amplitude motion and the dominating wake
features. Through our investigation of wake-body synchronization below critical
Re range, we discover that the bluff body can undergo a synchronized
high-amplitude vibration due to flexibility-induced unsteadiness. The
interaction cycle for the wake-synchronization is found to be valid for the
turbulent wake flow.

small scale three dimensional (3D) perturbations and large scale
two-dimensional (2D) perturbations. The former provide an indication of a
forward transfer of energy while the later indicate an inverse transfer and the
possibility of an inverse cascade. The analysis is performed using a
Floquet-Bloch code that allows to examine the stability of modes with arbitrary
large scale separation. For thin layers the 3D perturbations become unstable
when the layer thickness $H$ becomes larger than $H > c_1 (\nu
\ell_{_U}/U)^{1/2}= c_1 \ell_{_U} Re^{-1/2}$, where $U$ is the rms velocity of
the flown, $\ell_{_U}$ is the correlation length scale of the flow, $\nu$ the
viscosity and $Re=\ell_{_U} U/\nu$ is the Reynolds number. At the same time
large scale 2D perturbations also become unstable by an eddy viscosity
mechanism when $Re>c_2$, where $c_1,c_2$ are order one non-dimensional numbers.
These relations define different regions in parameter space where 2D and 3D
instabilities can (co-)exist and this allows to construct a stability diagram.
Implications of these results for fully turbulent flows that display a change

among intermolecular pairs of united atoms and allowing fully for the
flexibility of the spacer chain. Detailed results are presented for the CB7CB

to elucidate the structure of the low-temperature nematic phase. Polar
molecular ordering is clearly identified along a direction undergoing helical
twisting at right angles to the helical axis, with a constant pitch of about of

improvements over conventional approaches such as spectral subtraction and
non-negative matrix factorization, but do not generalize well to noise
conditions they were not trained for. In comparison to DNNs, humans show
remarkable noise suppression capabilities that yield successful speech
intelligibility under various adverse listening conditions and negative
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Motivated by the excellent human performance,
this paper explores whether numerical models that simulate human cochlear
signal processing can be combined with DNNs to improve the robustness of DNN
based noise suppression systems. Five cochlear models were coupled to
fully-connected and recurrent NN-based noise suppression systems and were
trained and evaluated for a variety of noise conditions using objective
metrics: perceptual speech quality (PESQ), segmental SNR and cepstral distance.
The simulations show that biophysically-inspired cochlear models improve the
generalizability of DNN-based noise suppression systems for unseen noise and
negative SNRs. This approach thus leads to robust noise suppression systems
that are less sensitive to the noise type and noise level. Because cochlear
models capture the intrinsic nonlinearities and dynamics of peripheral auditory
processing, it is shown here that accounting for their deterministic signal
processing improves machine hearing and avoids overtraining of multi-layer
DNNs. We hence conclude that machines hear better when realistic cochlear
models are used at the input of DNNs.

applied to the system. Feedback linearization method here is used for two
purposes; to attain an approximation of necessary system dynamics and to assess
the performance of the proposed adaptive fuzzy controller by comparing the
results of both adaptive fuzzy and feedback linearization controllers. An
indirect adaptive fuzzy controller, resistant to parameter variations is then
proposed. The general structure of the adaptive controller is specified in the

intermediate layers of deep neural networks. Its tendency to improve accuracy
and speed up training have established BN as a favorite technique in deep
learning. Yet, despite its enormous success, there remains little consensus on
the exact reason and mechanism behind these improvements. In this paper we take
a step towards a better understanding of BN, following an empirical approach.
We conduct several experiments, and show that BN primarily enables training
with larger learning rates, which is the cause for faster convergence and
better generalization. For networks without BN we demonstrate how large
gradient updates can result in diverging loss and activations growing
uncontrollably with network depth, which limits possible learning rates. BN
avoids this problem by constantly correcting activations to be zero-mean and of
unit standard deviation, which enables larger gradient steps, yields faster
convergence and may help bypass sharp local minima. We further show various
ways in which gradients and activations of deep unnormalized networks are
ill-behaved. We contrast our results against recent findings in random matrix
theory, shedding new light on classical initialization schemes and their

hydrodynamic interactions between spherical particles near a planar elastic

combination of the multipole expansion and Faxen's theorems, we express the
frequency-dependent hydrodynamic mobility functions as a power series of the
ratio of the particle radius to the distance from the membrane for the self
mobilities, and as a power series of the ratio of the radius to the
interparticle distance for the pair mobilities. In the quasi-steady limit of
zero frequency, we find that the shear- and bending-related contributions to
the particle mobilities may have additive or suppressive effects depending on
the membrane properties in addition to the geometric configuration of the
interacting particles relative to the confining membrane. To elucidate the
effect and role of the change of sign observed in the particle self and pair
mobilities, we consider an example involving a torque-free doublet of
counterrotating particles near an elastic membrane. We find that the induced
rotation rate of the doublet around its center of mass may differ in magnitude
and direction depending on the membrane shear and bending properties. Near a
membrane of only energetic resistance toward shear deformation, such as that of
a certain type of elastic capsules, the doublet undergoes rotation of the same
sense as observed near a no-slip wall. Near a membrane of only energetic
resistance toward bending, such as that of a fluid vesicle, we find a reversed
sense of rotation. Our analytical predictions are supplemented and compared
with fully resolved boundary integral simulations where a very good agreement

Electro-optic modulators are a crucial contributor of dissipation in such
links. Numerous variations on important mechanisms such as free-carrier
modulation and the Pockels effect are currently pursued, but there are few
investigations of mechanical motion as an electro-optic mechanism in silicon.
In this work, we demonstrate electrical driving and optical read-out of a 7.2
GHz mechanical mode of a silicon photonic waveguide. The electrical driving is
capacitive and can be implemented in any material system. The measurements show
that the mechanically-mediated optical phase modulation is two orders of
magnitude more efficient than the background phase modulation in our system.
Our demonstration is an important step towards efficient
opto-electro-mechanical devices in a scalable photonic platform.

structure can be classified into three broad categories: continuous,
continuous-from-discrete, and discrete representations. We propose modeling
micro-structure with a class of discrete Corner-Sharing Tetrahedra (CoSTs).
CoSTs can represent bar-joint, tensegrity, line-incidence, and similar
constraint systems that capture local physical constraints and global
multi-scale properties for design and analysis. The paper develops a palette of
simple geometry processing operations on CoSTs including graph manipulation,
hierarchical refinement, randomization, and generating associated continuous
representations.

aerosol characterization to obtain highly discriminatory information on the
chemistry of aerosol particles. Sensing of aerosols is crucial for various
environmental, climactic, warfare threat detection, and pulmonary healthcare
applications. Further, there are a number of unintended situations for
potential exposure to bioaerosols such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi. For
instance, the current pandemic scenario of COVID-19 occurring across the world.
Currently, chemical characterization of aerosols is performed using FTIR
spectroscopy yielding chemical fingerprinting because most of the vibrational
and rotational transitions of chemical molecules fall in the MIR range; and
Raman spectroscopy. Both techniques use free space bench-top geometries. Here,
we propose miniaturized on-chip MIR photonics-based aerosol spectroscopy
consisting of a broadband spiral-waveguide sensor that significantly enhances
particle-light interaction to improve sensitivity. The spiral waveguides are
made of a chalcogenide glass material (Ge23Sb7S70) which shows a broad
transparency over IR range. We demonstrate the sensing of N-methyl
aniline-based aerosol particles with the device. We anticipate that the sensor
will readily complement existing photonic resonator-based particle sizing and
counting techniques to develop a unified framework for on-chip integrated
photonic aerosol spectroscopy.
