considered for a LiDAR-based indoor mapping system which presents itself as a

paper shows how classic offline Coverage Path Planning (CPP) can be altered for
use with online SLAM by proposing two modifications: (i) performing convex
decomposition of the polygonal coverage area to allow for an arbitrary choice
of an initial point while still tracing the shortest coverage path and (ii)
using a new approach to stitch together the different cells within the
polygonal area to form a continuous coverage path. Furthermore, an alteration

that evaluates navigation errors in terms of an area coverage cost function.
The implementation results show how the combination of the two modified offline

around $3n$ for several decades. Moreover, the only known technique for proving
lower bounds in this model, gate elimination, is inherently limited to proving
lower bounds of less than $5n$. In this work, we propose a non-gate-elimination
approach for obtaining circuit lower bounds, via certain depth-three lower
bounds. We prove that every (unbounded-depth) circuit of size $s$ can be
expressed as an OR of $2^{s/3.9}$ $16$-CNFs. For DeMorgan formulas, the best
known size lower bounds have been stuck at around $n^{3-o(1)}$ for decades.
Under a plausible hypothesis about probabilistic polynomials, we show that
$n^{4-\varepsilon}$-size DeMorgan formulas have
$2^{n^{1-\Omega(\varepsilon)}}$-size depth-3 circuits which are approximate
sums of $n^{1-\Omega(\varepsilon)}$-degree polynomials over ${\mathbb F}_2$.
While these structural results do not immediately lead to new lower bounds,
they do suggest new avenues of attack on these longstanding lower bound
problems.
  Our results complement the classical depth-$3$ reduction results of Valiant,
which show that logarithmic-depth circuits of linear size can be computed by an
OR of $2^{\varepsilon n}$ $n^{\delta}$-CNFs, and slightly stronger results for
series-parallel circuits. It is known that no purely graph-theoretic reduction
could yield interesting depth-3 circuits from circuits of super-logarithmic
depth. We overcome this limitation (for small-size circuits) by taking into
account both the graph-theoretic and functional properties of circuits and
formulas.
  We show that improvements of the following pseudorandom constructions imply
new circuit lower bounds: dispersers for varieties, correlation with constant
degree polynomials, matrix rigidity, and hardness for depth-$3$ circuits with
constant bottom fan-in.

embed a multi-functional few nm thick high-k oxide within van der Waals devices

achieved by in-situ laser oxidation of embedded few layer HfS2 crystals. The
resultant oxide is found to be in the amorphous phase with a dielectric
constant of k~15 and break-down electric fields in the range of 0.5-0.6 V/nm.
This transformation allows for the creation of a variety of fundamental
nano-electronic and opto-electronic devices including, flexible Schottky
barrier field effect transistors, dual gated graphene transistors as well as
vertical light emitting and detecting tunnelling transistors. Furthermore, upon
dielectric break-down, electrically conductive filaments are formed. This
filamentation process can be used to electrically contact encapsulated
conductive materials. Careful control of the filamentation process also allows
for reversible switching between two resistance states. This allows for the
creation of resistive switching random access memories (ReRAMs). We believe
that this method of embedding a high-k oxide within complex van der Waals
heterostructures could play an important role in future flexible
multi-functional van der Waals devices.

formulated in terms of the semiclassical expansion of the bilocal field path
integral. We derive cutting rules, which are applicable for all planar vertices
in the bilocal field diagrams. We show that these cutting rules lead to novel
identities on higher-point correlators, which could be used to constrain their
form beyond the solvable conformal limit. We also demonstrate how the cutting
rules can simplify the computation of amplitudes on an example of the six-point
function.

non-monotonic and gate-voltage-dependent excursion of the resistivity at low

sensitivity to magnetism in the a-RuCl_3. Thus proximity to graphene is a means
to access magnetic properties of thin layers of magnetic insulators.

applications in the field of nano optics and metamaterials. Their sensitivity
to incident circularly polarized light in combination with the ability of
extreme electromagnetic field localization renders them ideal candidates for
chiral sensing and for all-optical information processing. Here, the resonant
modes of single plasmonic helices are investigated. We find that a single
plasmonic helix can be efficiently excited with circularly polarized light of
both equal and opposite handedness relative to that of the helix. An analytic
model provides resonance conditions matching the results of full-field
modeling. The underlying geometric considerations explain the mechanism of
excitation and deliver quantitative design rules for plasmonic helices being
resonant in a desired wavelength range. Based on the developed analytical
design tool, single silver helices were fabricated and optically characterized.
They show the expected strong chiroptical response to both handednesses in the

of representative Milky Way-sized galaxies, one disk dominated and another
bulge-dominated. We generate data cubes emulating MaNGA/SDSS-IV instrumental
and observational conditions, and analyze them using the Pipe3D pipeline. For
optimal MaNGA instrumental/observational setups, the global masses, ages, and
dust extinctions of both galaxies are well recovered within the uncertainties,
while for the radial distributions, the trend is to get slightly flatter age
gradients and weaker inside-out growth modes than the true ones. The main bias
is in recovering younger stellar populations in the inner, older regions, and
slightly older stellar populations in the outer, younger regions, as well as
lower global stellar masses. These trends are enhanced as lower is the spatial
sampling/resolution (less number of fibers), more inclined and dust-attenuated
is the observed galaxy, lower is the signal-to-noise ratio, and worse is the
seeing. The recovered properties and histories are more affected for the
disk-dominated galaxy with a prominent inside-out growth mode than for the
bulge-dominated galaxy assembled earlier and more coherently. We make publicly

requires the model to train on image-label pairs from some seen classes and
test on the task of classifying new images from both seen and unseen classes.
Most previous models try to learn a fixed one-directional mapping between
visual and semantic space, while some recently proposed generative methods try
to generate image features for unseen classes so that the zero-shot learning
problem becomes a traditional fully-supervised classification problem. In this
paper, we propose a novel model that provides a unified framework for three
different approaches: visual-> semantic mapping, semantic->visual mapping, and
metric learning. Specifically, our proposed model consists of a feature
generator that can generate various visual features given class embeddings as
input, a regressor that maps each visual feature back to its corresponding
class embedding, and a discriminator that learns to evaluate the closeness of
an image feature and a class embedding. All three components are trained under
the combination of cyclic consistency loss and dual adversarial loss.
Experimental results show that our model not only preserves higher accuracy in
classifying images from seen classes, but also performs better than existing

have ranges and/or priors for the parameters which are to be retrieved that
include our degree of knowledge (or ignorance) in the routines which are being
used. In Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routines, for example, these enter as
prior distributions. These can either represent our current knowledge of the
distribution of such parameters (e.g., based on their observed values) or
physically plausible parameters ranges to be sampled. Among the parameters that
are constrained by transiting exoplanet lightcurves, there are two which are of
much physical significance: the impact parameter of the orbit, $b = (a/R_*)\cos
i $, and the planet-to-star radius ratio, $p = R_p/R_s$ (which defines the
transit depth, $\delta = p^2$). These two are natural parameters to extract and
constrain as they usually have well defined limits. A common set of
""uninformative"" priors used for those two parameters are uniform priors.
However, this poses a sampling problem especially important for grazing orbits:
given that we sample a value $p_i$ from the prior on $p$, the only physically
plausible values for $b$ to be sampled given $p_i$ are those that satisfy $b <
1 + p_i$. If we simply reject the sample if the sampled value of b is greater
than $1 + p_i$, then we will reject points from a significant portion of the
prior area depending on its size. It is desirable, thus, to have an algorithm
that efficiently samples values from the physically plausible zone in the
$(b,p)$ plane. Here we present such an algorithm.

equivalent to the renormalized cubic NLS for regular solutions. For rough
functions, the normal form equation behaves better than the renormalized cubic
NLS, thus providing a further renormalization of the cubic NLS. We then prove
that this normal form equation is unconditionally globally well-posed in the
Fourier-Lebesgue spaces $\mathcal{F} L^p(\mathbb{T})$, $1 \leq p < \infty$. By
inverting the transformation, we conclude global well-posedness of the

of the giant planets during an episode of giant planet migration is still
poorly known. We use a combination of dynamical N-body and Monte Carlo
simulations to determine impact probabilities, impact velocities, and expected
masses that collide with these satellites to determine the chronology of
impacts during the migration. Volatile loss through bombardment is typically
20% for Miranda, a few percents for the larger Uranian satellites and
negligible for the Galilean satellites. Due to its small size and the high
impact velocity there is a >99% chance that Miranda suffered a catastrophic
impact that shattered the satellite. Subsequent re-accretion from a
circum-Uranian ring could account for its peculiar surface morphology and low
density. The probability to destroy Ariel and Umbriel is 15% and 1% for Titania
and Oberon. Approximately 90% of the mass in planetesimals that passes through
the Jovian and Uranian satellite systems (about $4 {\rm \ M_{\oplus}}$ and $2
{\rm \ M_{\oplus}}$ respectively) does so in about 15 Myr. This extremely rapid
and intense bombardment causes repeated local crustal melting on all
satellites. The combination of these effects results in an entirely different
impact chronology than that of the inner solar system. We conclude that the
simple extrapolation of the lunar chronology to the outer solar system
satellites is not correct. The tail end (after 25 Myr) of the chronology
function has an e-folding time of 100 Myr at Jupiter, but follows a cumulative
Weibull distribution at Uranus, making direct comparisons between the gas and
ice giant planets difficult. Based on our results the surfaces of the Uranian

and a very small fraction, <3%, of ~5800 K hot spot. We calculate a planetary
radius for TRAPPIST-1g to be Rp = 1.124 R$_\oplus$ with a planetary density of
$\rho_p$ = 0.8214 $\rho_\oplus$. Based on the stellar reconstruction there are
eleven plausible scenarios for the combined stellar photosphere and planet
transit geometry; in our analysis we are able to rule out 8 of the 11
scenarios. Using planetary models we evaluate the remaining scenarios with
respect to the transmission spectrum of TRAPPIST-1g. We conclude that the
planetary transmission spectrum is likely not contaminated by any stellar
spectral features, and are able to rule out a clear solar H2/He-dominated
atmosphere at greater than 3-sigma.

treat well-behaved algebras of unbounded operators independently of a
representation. To this end, Archimedean ordered *-algebras (*-algebras whose
real linear subspace of Hermitian elements are an Archimedean ordered vector
space with rather weak compatibilities with the algebraic structure) are
examined. The order induces a translation-invariant uniform metric which comes
from a C*-norm in the bounded case. It will then be shown that uniformly
complete Archimedean ordered *-algebras have good order properties (like
existence of infima, suprema or absolute values) if and only if they have good
algebraic properties (like existence of inverses or square roots). This
suggests the definition of Su*-algebras as uniformly complete Archimedean
ordered *-algebras which have all these equivalent properties. All methods used
are completely elementary and do not require any representation theory and not
even any assumptions of boundedness, so Su*-algebras generalize some important
properties of C^*-algebras to algebras of unbounded operators. Similarly, they
generalize some properties of Phi-algebras (certain lattice-ordered commutative
real algebras) to non-commutative ordered *-algebras. As an example,
Su*-algebras of unbounded operators on a Hilbert space are constructed. They
arise e.g. as *-algebras of symmetries of a self-adjoint (not necessarily
bounded) Hamiltonian operator of a quantum mechanical system.

the first huge annotated CQA summarization dataset by filtering the 4.4 million

In
our approach, we compensate for the magnetic forces acting on the insertion
device (ID) arrays by installing a number of compact hydraulic cylinders along
the ID. These assisting cylinders are connected to a single hydraulic line and
activated by the same pressure. A computer-controlled closed-loop feedback
system maintains the target ID array position and an acceptable load on the
mechanical driver. This is accomplished by simultaneously controlling both the
hydraulic assist pressure and the mechanical driver position. The quantity and
location of the compact hydraulic cylinders are optimized to keep the
deformation of ID structural components in an acceptable range. The hydraulic
cylinders compensate for over 90% of the strong forces generated by the
magnetic field. This reduces the load applied to a conventional mechanical
driver to less than 10% of the total load. The implementation of this type of
driver can make insertion devices much more compact without compromising their
performance
  In the proof-of-concept experiments, our novel hydraulic-assist driver
demonstrated a long-term stability and reproducibility of the ID gap within 2
microns. Magnetic field stability and reproducibility was within 6e-5 of the
normalized field strength or better. Here we will describe the concept, details

$Spitzer$ with a sample of 223 stars. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to
determine the effects of various model parameters on the polarization level and
find the mass required for detection with current instruments. Eighteen stars
were detected with a polarization $0.01 \le P \lesssim 0.1$ per cent and
$\ge3\sigma_P$, but only two of them have a debris disk. No statistically
significant difference is found between the different groups of stars, with,
without, and unknown status for far-infrared excess, and presence of

small, usually $< 0.01$ per cent for typical masses detected by their
far-infrared excess for hot and most warm disks. Masses observed in cold disks
can produce polarization levels above $0.01$ per cent since there is usually
more dust in them than in closer disks. We list five factors which can explain

variability. $52 \pm 5\%$ of known early-type young stars and $43 \pm 4 \%$ of
known late-type giants are variable. These variability fractions are higher
than those of other young, massive star populations or late-type giants in
globular clusters, and can be largely explained by two factors. First, our
experiment time baseline is sensitive to long-term intrinsic stellar
variability. Second, the proper motion of stars behind spatial inhomogeneities
in the foreground extinction screen can lead to variability. We recover the two
known Galactic center eclipsing binary systems: IRS 16SW and S4-258 (E60). We
constrain the Galactic center eclipsing binary fraction of known early-type
stars to be at least $2.4 \pm 1.7\%$. We find no evidence of an eclipsing
binary among the young S-stars nor among the young stellar disk members. These
results are consistent with the local OB eclipsing binary fraction. We identify
a new periodic variable, S2-36, with a 39.43 day period. Further observations
are necessary to determine the nature of this source.

transmission consumes one unit of energy. The sensor is equipped with a
unit-sized battery to save its incoming energy, which arrives according to a
Poisson process of unit rate. The setting is online, in which energy arrival
times are only revealed causally after being harvested, and the goal is to
design transmission times such that the long term average age of information
(AoI), defined as the time elapsed since the latest update has reached the
destination successfully, is minimized. The optimal status update policy is
first shown to have a renewal structure, in which the time instants at which
the destination receives an update successfully constitute a renewal process.
Then, for $q\leq\frac{1}{2}$, the optimal renewal policy is shown to have a
threshold structure, in which a new status update is transmitted only if the
AoI grows above a certain threshold, that is shown to be a decreasing function
of $q$. While for $q>\frac{1}{2}$, the optimal renewal policy is shown to be

vector Goldstone mode and a two-form superfluid velocity. Two special limits of
this theory have been studied in detail: the string fluid limit where the U(1)
one-form symmetry is partly restored, and the electric limit in which the
symmetry is completely broken. The transport properties of these theories are
investigated in depth by studying the constraints arising from the second law
of thermodynamics and Onsager's relations at first order in derivatives. We
also construct a hydrostatic effective action for the Goldstone modes in these
theories and use it to characterise the space of all equilibrium
configurations. To make explicit contact with hot electromagnetism, the
traditional treatment of magnetohydrodynamics, where the electromagnetic photon
is incorporated as dynamical degrees of freedom, is extended to include
parity-violating contributions. We argue that the chemical potential and
electric fields are not independently dynamical in magnetohydrodynamics, and
illustrate how to eliminate these within the hydrodynamic derivative expansion

coincident with the H$\alpha$ tail, which we identify as young stars formed in
the tail. We also determine they are likely to be unbound stellar complexes
with sizes of $\sim$ $50-100$ pc, likely to disperse as they age. From a
comparison of the colors and magnitudes of the young stellar complexes with
simple stellar population models, we find ages ranging from $\sim$ $1-50$ Myr,
and masses ranging from $10^3$ to $\sim$ $10^5$ M$_{\odot}$. We find the
overall rate and efficiency of star formation are low, $\sim$ $6.0 \times \,
10^{-3}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and $\sim$ $6 \, \times$ 10$^{-12}$ yr$^{-1}$
respectively. The total H$\alpha$ flux of the tail would correspond to a star
formation rate $7$ times higher, indicating some other mechanism for H$\alpha$
excitation is dominant. From analysis of colors, we track the progression of
outside-in star formation quenching in the main body of D100, as well as its
apparent companion the S0 D99. Finally, we observe the dust extinction in the
base of the tail has an outer envelope with remarkably smooth and straight
edges, and linear filamentary substructure strongly suggestive of magnetic
fields. These features and the small amount of tail broadening strongly suggest
gas cooling restricting broadening, and the influence of magnetic fields
inhibiting turbulence.

of observed frequency will provide a powerful tool to study the ionization and
thermal history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) in the early Universe ($\sim$
400 million years after the Big Bang). The greatest challenge in conventional
total-power global 21 cm experiments is the removal of the foreground
synchrotron emission ($\sim 10^3$-$10^4$ K) to uncover the weak cosmological
signal (tens to hundreds of mK), especially since the intrinsic smoothness of
the foreground spectrum is corrupted by instrumental effects. Although the
EDGES team has recently reported an absorption profile at 78 MHz in the
sky-averaged spectrum, it is necessary to confirm this detection with an
independent approach. The projection effect from observing anisotropic
foreground source emission with a wide-view antenna pointing at the North
Celestial Pole (NCP) can induce a net polarization, referred as the
Projection-Induced Polarization Effect (PIPE). Due to Earth's rotation,
observation centered at the circumpolar region will impose a dynamic sky
modulation on the net polarization's waveforms which is unique to the
foreground component. In this study, we review the implementation practicality
and underlying instrumental effects of this new polarimetry-based technique

Twilight Polarimeter (CTP). In addition, we explore an SVD-based analysis
approach for separating the foreground and instrumental effects from the

superconductivity in the low-temperature phase diagram. We theoretically show
that twisted bilayer graphene should have an enhanced and strongly twist-angle
dependent linear-in-temperature resistivity in the metallic regime with the
resistivity magnitude increasing as the twist angle approaches the magic angle.
The slope of the resistivity versus temperature could approach one hundred ohms
per kelvin with a strong angle dependence, but with a rather weak dependence on
the carrier density. This higher-temperature density-independent linear-in-$T$
resistivity crosses over to a $T^4$ dependence at a low density-dependent
characteristic temperature, becoming unimportant at low temperatures. This
angle-tuned resistivity enhancement arises from the huge increase in the
effective electron-acoustic phonon coupling in the system due to the
suppression of graphene Fermi velocity induced by the flatband condition in the
moir\'e superlattice system. Our calculated temperature dependence is
reminiscent of the so-called `strange metal' transport behavior except that it
is arising from the ordinary electron-phonon coupling in a rather unusual
parameter space due to the generic moir\'e flatband structure of twisted
bilayer graphene. We also show that the same enhanced electron-acoustic phonon
coupling also mediates effective attractive interactions in $s$, $p$, $d$ and
$f$ pairing channels with a theoretical superconducting transition temperature
on the order of $\sim$5 K near magic angle. The fact that ordinary acoustic
phonons can produce exotic non-$s$-wave superconducting pairing arises from the
unusual symmetries of the system.

magneto-photoluminescence spectroscopy using magnetic fields up to 29 T. We
found that $g_{exc}$ is strongly anisotropic with values differing in excess of
50\% between the magnetic field oriented parallel and perpendicular to the
nanowire long axis. Furthermore, for magnetic fields oriented along the
nanowire axis, $g_{exc}$ is nearly three times larger than in bulk zincblende
InP and it shows a marked sublinear dependence on the magnetic field, a common
feature to other non-nitride III-V wurtzite nanowires but not properly

branch characterized by a specific type of light polarization. All the
experimental findings are modeled theoretically by a robust approach combining
the $k \cdot p$ method with the envelope function approximation and including
the electron-hole interaction. We revealed that the nonlinear features arise
due to the coupling between Landau levels pertaining to the A (heavy-hole like)
and B (light-hole like) valence bands of the wurtzite crystal structure. This
general behavior is particularly relevant for the understanding of the spin
properties of several wurtzite nanowires that host the set for the observation

suggests that the gas produced may be naturally rich in C and O, while the
alternative preferential depletion scenario states that the enrichment has
evolved to the current state from a gas with solar-like abundances. In the
latter case, the radiation pressure from the star expels the gas outwards,
leaving behind species less sensitive to stellar radiation such as C and O.
Nitrogen is also not sensitive to radiation pressure due to its low oscillator
strength, which would make it also overabundant under the preferential
depletion scenario. As such, the abundance of N in the disk may provide clues
to why C and O are overabundant. We aim to measure the N column density in the
direction of $\beta$ Pic, and use this information to disentangle these
different scenarios explaining the C and O overabundance. Using far-UV
spectroscopic data collected by the HST's Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS)

modelling the absorption lines. We measure the N column density in the

$\log(N_{\mathrm{NI}}/1\,\mathrm{cm}^2) = 14.9\pm0.7$. The N gas is found to be
consistent with solar abundances and Halley dust. The solar N abundance
supports the preferential production hypothesis, in which the composition of
gas in $\beta$\,Pic is the result of photodesorption from icy grains rich in C
and O or collisional vaporisation of C and O rich dust in the disk. It does not
support the hypothesis that C and O are overabundant due to the insensitivity
of C and O to radiation pressure thereby leaving them to accumulate in the

fluctuating incommensurate spin density waves for the hole-doped cuprates. Our
primary assumption is that all low energy fermionic excitations are gauge
neutral and electron-like, while the spin density wave order is fractionalized
into Higgs fields transforming as adjoints of the gauge SU(2). The confining
phase of the gauge theory is a conventional Fermi liquid with a large Fermi
surface (and its associated $d$-wave superconductor). There is a quantum phase
transition to a Higgs phase describing the `pseudogap' at lower doping.
Depending upon the quartic terms in the Higgs potential, the Higgs phase
exhibits one or more of charge density wave, Ising-nematic, time-reversal odd
scalar spin chirality, and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders. It is notable
that the emergent broken symmetries in our theory of fluctuating spin density
waves co-incide with those observed in diverse experiments. For the
electron-doped cuprates, the spin density wave fluctuations are at wavevector
$(\pi,\pi)$, and then the corresponding SU(2) gauge theory only has a crossover
between the confining and Higgs regimes, with an exponentially large
confinement scale deep in the Higgs regime. On the Higgs side, for both the
electron- and hole-doped cases, and at scales shorter than the confinement
scale (which can be infinite when $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order is present),
the electron spectral function has a `fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*)' form
with small Fermi surfaces. We also describe the deconfined quantum criticality
of the Higgs transition in the limit of a large number of Higgs flavors, and
perturbatively discuss its coupling to fermionic excitations.

the sources depict an almost noiseless, coeval stellar main sequence in the
observational Hertzsprung-Russel diagram. The spatial arrangement of the
selected members represents a highly flattened shape with respect to the
direction of movement along the clusters' orbit in the Galaxy. The size of the
entire structure, within the limits of the observations, measures about 200 pc
in its largest extent, while being only about 25 pc thick. This translates to
an on-sky extent of well beyond 100 deg. Intriguingly, a top-down view on the

agreement with previously published theoretical predictions for the tidal tails

Solving the relativistic Boltzmann equation perturbatively, we explicitly show
that these deviations are not 20% as claimed, but rather are about 10^-17 in
size and hence cannot significantly alter the predicted light-element
abundances. We discuss and compute two related effects: O(0.1%) corrections to
the kinetic distributions of nuclei that arise from small relativistic
corrections to the MB distribution and a much smaller effect, nuclear kinetic
drag, which arises from the heat transferred from the EM plasma to nuclei that
is needed to maintain kinetic equilibrium.

S\'ersic fits and stellar masses of CMASS galaxies for which HSC weak lensing
data is available, visually selected to have spheroidal morphology. We apply a
cut in stellar mass, $\log{M_*/M_\odot} > 11.0$,selecting $\sim$10, 000

the distribution of S\'ersic index and size as a function of stellar mass.
Then, making use of shear measurements from HSC, we measure the distribution of
halo mass as a function of stellar mass, size and S\'ersic index. Results. Our
data reveals a steep stellar mass-size relation $R_e \propto M_*^{\beta_R}$,
with $\beta_R$ larger than unity, and a positive correlation between S\'ersic
index and stellar mass: $n \propto M_*^{0.46}$. Halo mass scales approximately
with the 1.7 power of the stellar mass. We do not find evidence for an
additional dependence of halo mass on size or S\'ersic index at fixed stellar
mass. Conclusions. Our results disfavour galaxy evolution models that predict
significant differences in the size growth efficiency of galaxies living in low

discrepancy between lensing masses and the dynamical mass estimates, which
could be accounted by astrophysical processes such as dynamical friction, by
the inclusion of unbound pairs, and by significant deviations of the density

considerably less when satellite locations are measured with respect to the

of antennas employing cache-enabled \textit{uplink} transmission. In
particular, we formulate a scenario, where the users upload their content to
their strongest base stations (BSs), which are Poisson point process (PPP)
distributed. In addition, the BSs, exploiting the benefits of massive MIMO,
upload their contents to the core network by means of a finite-rate backhaul.
After proposing the caching policies, where we propose the {modified} von Mises
distribution as the popularity distribution function, we derive the outage
probability and the average delivery rate by taking advantage of tools from the
deterministic equivalent (DE) and stochastic geometry analyses. Numerical
results investigate the realistic performance gains of the proposed
heterogeneous cache-enabled uplink on the network in terms of cardinal
operating parameters. For example, insights regarding the BSs storage size are
exposed. Moreover, the impacts of the key parameters such the file popularity
distribution, and the target bitrate are investigated. Specifically, the outage
probability decreases if the storage size is increased, while the average
delivery rate increases. In addition, the concentration parameter, defining the
number of files stored at the intermediate nodes (popularity), affects directly
the proposed metrics. A higher target rate results in higher outage because
fewer users obey this constraint. Also, we demonstrate that a denser network
decreases the outage and increases the delivery rate. Hence, the introduction
of caching at the uplink of the system design ameliorates the network
performance.

effects are expected in regions where gravity is strong. Here, we show that i.
A background EM field induces an axionic instability in flat space, for large
enough electric fields. Conversely, a homogeneous harmonic axion field induces
an instability in the Maxwell sector. When carried over to curved spacetime,
this phenomena translates into generic instabilities of charged black holes
(BHs). ii. In the presence of charge, BH uniqueness results are lost. We find
solutions which are small deformations of the Kerr-Newman geometry and hairy
stationary solutions without angular momentum, which are `dragged' by the
axion. Axion fields must exist around spinning BHs if these are immersed in
external magnetic fields. The axion profile can be obtained perturbatively from
the electro-vacuum solution derived by Wald. iii. Ultralight axions trigger
superradiant instabilities of spinning BHs and form an axionic cloud in the
exterior geometry. The superradiant growth can be interrupted or suppressed
through axionic or scalar couplings to EM. These couplings lead to periodic
bursts of light, which occur throughout the history of energy extraction from
the BH. We provide numerical and simple analytical estimates for the rates of
these processes. iv. Finally, we discuss how plasma effects can affect the

more prominent emission line properties than LEGs: larger, more disturbed, more

factors. We find evidence of correlations between line luminosities and (radio

origin, the active nucleus, which ionize the surrounding gas. However, the
contribution of additional photoionization mechanism (jet shocks and star
formation) are needed to account for the different line properties of the two
classes. A relationship between the accretion, photoionization and feedback
modes emerges from this study. For LEGs (hot-gas accretors), the synchrotron
emission from the jet represents the main source of ionizing photons. The lack
of cold gas and star formation in their hosts accounts for the moderate
ionized-gas masses and sizes. For HEGs (cold-gas accretors), an ionizing
continuum from a standard disk and shocks from the powerful jets are the main
sources of photoionization, with the contribution from star formation. These

${\cal C}(r^{\text{inner}}_{\gamma})\leq{\cal C}(r^{\text{outer}}_{\gamma})$,

Extensive experimental and observational efforts are actively looking for
`axionic' imprints. Independently on their nature, their abundance, and on
their contribution to the dark matter problem, axions form dense clouds around
spinning black holes, grown by superradiant mechanisms. It was recently
suggested that once couplings to photons are considered, an exponential

that laser-like emission from clouds exists at the classical level, and we

the early Universe, where the conditions exist for rapid accretion. Direct
collapse black holes are often invoked as a possible solution to the
observation of super massive black holes (SMBHs) in the pre-reionisation
Universe. We investigate here how feedback, mainly in the form of bipolar jets,
from super-Eddington accreting seed black holes will affect their subsequent
growth. We find that, nearly independent of the mass loading of the bipolar
jets, the violent outflows generated by the jets evacuate a region of
approximately 0.1 pc surrounding the black hole seed. However, the jet outflows
are unable to break free of the halo and their impact is limited to the
immediate vicinity of the black hole. The outflows suppress any accretion for
approximately a dynamical time. The gas then cools, recombines and falls back
to the centre where high accretion rates are again observed. The overall effect
is to create an effective accretion rate with values of between 0.1 and 0.5
times the Eddington rate. If this episodic accretion rate is maintained for
order 500 million years then the black hole will increase in mass by a factor
of between 3 and 300 but far short of the factor of $10^4$ required for the
seeds to become the SMBHs observed at $z>6$. Therefore, direct collapse black
holes born into atomic cooling haloes and which experience strong negative
mechanical feedback will require external influences (e.g. rapid major mergers
with other haloes) to promote efficient accretion and reach SMBH masses within
a few hundred million years.

$10^7$ particles. We fit the spherically averaged density profiles of DM haloes
with the three parameter Einasto function. For our sample of haloes, the
Einasto shape parameter, $\alpha$, is uncorrelated with the concentration, $c$,
at fixed halo mass, and at all redshifts. Previous reports of an
anti-correlation are traced to fitting degeneracies, which our fits are less
sensitive to due to our higher spatial resolution. However, for individual
haloes the evolution in $\alpha$ and $c$ is anti-correlated: at redshift $z=7$,
$\alpha \simeq 0.4$ and decreases with time, while $c\simeq 3$ and increases
with time. The evolution in structure is primarily due to accretion of mass at
larger radii. We suggest that $\alpha$ traces the evolutionary state of the
halo, with dynamically young haloes having high $\alpha$ (closer to a top-hat:
$\alpha^{-1}=0$), and dynamically relaxed haloes having low $\alpha$ (closer to
isothermal: $\alpha=0$). Such an evolutionary dependence reconciles the
increase of $\alpha$ vs peak height, $\nu$, with the dependence on the slope of
the power spectrum of initial density fluctuations found by previous studies.

complex interstellar medium. The latter mainly consists of a torus of dense
clumps and streams of molecular gas (the circumnuclear disk, CND) enclosing
streamers of ionized gas (the Minispiral). In this complex environment,
knowledge of the local extinction that locally affects each feature is crucial
to properly study and disentangle them. We previously studied molecular gas in
this region and inferred an extinction map from two H2 lines. Extinction
appears to be correlated with the dereddened flux in several contiguous areas
in the field of view. Here, we discuss the origin of this local correlation. We
model the observed effect with a simple radiative transfer model. H2 emission
arises from the surfaces of clumps (i.e., shells) that are exposed to the
ambient ultraviolet (UV) radiation field. We consider the shell at the surface
of an emitting clump. The shell has a varying optical depth and a screen of
dust in front of it. The optical depth varies from one line of sight to
another, either because of varying extinction coefficient from the shell of one
clump to that of another or because of a varying number of identical clumps on
the line of sight. In both scenarios, the model accurately reproduces the
dependence of molecular gas emission and extinction. The reason for this
correlation is that, in the central parsec, the molecular gas is mixed
everywhere with dust that locally affects the observed gas emission. In
addition, there is extinction due to foreground (screen) dust. This analysis
favors a scenario where the central parsec is filled with clumps of dust and
molecular gas. Separating foreground from local extinction allows for a probe
for local conditions (H2 is mixed with dust) and can also constrain the
three-dimensional (3D) position of objects under study.

hardware to provide excellent performance for uncontended transactions, and is
popular in high-performance in-memory databases and transactional systems. But
at high contention levels, OCC is susceptible to frequent aborts, leading to
wasted work and degraded performance. Contention managers, mixed
optimistic/pessimistic concurrency control algorithms, and novel
optimistic-inspired concurrency control algorithms, such as TicToc, aim to
address this problem, but these mechanisms introduce sometimes-high overheads
of their own. We show that in real-world benchmarks, traditional OCC can
outperform these alternative mechanisms by simply adding fine-grained version
timestamps (using different timestamps for disjoint components of each record).
With fine-grained timestamps, OCC gets 1.14x TicToc's throughput in TPC-C at
128 cores (previous work reported TicToc having 1.8x higher throughput than OCC
at 80 hyperthreads). Our study shows that timestamp granularity has a greater
impact than previously thought on the performance of transaction processing
systems, and should not be overlooked in the push for faster concurrency
control schemes.

variational quantum circuits in a way that is compatible with classical
techniques such as backpropagation. PennyLane thus extends the automatic
differentiation algorithms common in optimization and machine learning to
include quantum and hybrid computations. A plugin system makes the framework
compatible with any gate-based quantum simulator or hardware. We provide
plugins for hardware providers including the Xanadu Cloud, Amazon Braket, and
IBM Quantum, allowing PennyLane optimizations to be run on publicly accessible
quantum devices. On the classical front, PennyLane interfaces with accelerated
machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX, and Autograd.
PennyLane can be used for the optimization of variational quantum eigensolvers,
quantum approximate optimization, quantum machine learning models, and many
other applications.

open quantum systems in their full generality. We derive a {\em quantum
level-2.5 large deviation principle} for these systems, which describes the
joint fluctuations of time-averaged quantum jump rates and of the time-averaged
quantum state for long times. Like its level-2.5 counterpart for classical
continuous-time Markov chains (which it contains as a special case) this
description is both {\em explicit and complete}, as the statistics of arbitrary
time-extensive dynamical observables can be obtained by contraction from the
explicit level-2.5 rate functional we derive. Our approach uses an unravelled
representation of the quantum dynamics which allows these statistics to be
obtained by analysing a classical stochastic process in the space of pure
states. For quantum reset processes we show that the unravelled dynamics is
semi-Markov, and derive bounds on the asymptotic variance of the number of
quantum jumps which generalise classical thermodynamic uncertainty relations.
We finish by discussing how our level-2.5 approach can be used to study large
deviations of non-linear functions of the state such as measures of

medium (CGM), in a diffuse volume-filling phase at roughly the virial
temperature. Much of the oxygen produced over cosmic time by the galaxy's stars
also ends up there. The resulting absorption lines in the spectra of UV and
X-ray background sources are powerful diagnostics of the feedback processes
that prevent more of those baryons from forming stars. This paper presents
predictions for CGM absorption lines (O VI, O VII, O VIII, Ne VIII, N V) that
are based on precipitation-regulated feedback models, which posit that the
radiative cooling time of the ambient medium cannot drop much below 10 times
the freefall time without triggering a strong feedback event. The resulting
predictions align with many different observational constraints on the Milky
Way's ambient CGM and explain why N_OVI ~ 10^14 cm^-2 over large ranges in halo
mass and projected radius. Within the precipitation framework, the strongest
O~VI absorption lines result from vertical mixing of the CGM that raises
low-entropy ambient gas to greater altitudes, because adiabatic cooling of the
uplifted gas then lowers its temperature and raises the fractional abundance of
O^5+. Condensation stimulated by uplift may also produce associated
low-ionization components. The observed velocity structure of the O VI
absorption suggests that galactic outflows do not expel circumgalactic gas at
the halo's escape velocity but rather drive circulation that dissipates much of
the galaxy's supernova energy within the ambient medium, causing some of it to
expand beyond the virial radius.

balance between accuracy and complexity of computations. Ternary Connect (TC)
\cite{lin2015neural} addresses this issue by restricting the parameters to
three levels $-1, 0$, and $+1$, thus eliminating multiplications in the forward
pass of the network during prediction. We propose Generalized Ternary Connect
(GTC), which allows an arbitrary number of levels while at the same time
eliminating multiplications by restricting the parameters to integer powers of
two. The primary contribution is that GTC learns the number of levels and their
values for each layer, jointly with the weights of the network in an end-to-end
fashion. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show that GTC naturally converges to
an `almost binary' network for deep classification networks (e.g. VGG-16) and
deep variational auto-encoders, with negligible loss of classification accuracy
and comparable visual quality of generated samples respectively. We demonstrate
superior compression and similar accuracy of GTC in comparison to several

simulations showing the potential benefits of GTC in hardware.

  Uncertainty Quantification",,,"10.1016/j.jcp.2020.109257",,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We describe and analyze a variance reduction approach for Monte Carlo (MC)
sampling that accelerates the estimation of statistics of computationally
expensive simulation models using an ensemble of models with lower cost. These
lower cost models --- which are typically lower fidelity with unknown
statistics --- are used to reduce the variance in statistical estimators
relative to a MC estimator with equivalent cost. We derive the conditions under
which our proposed approximate control variate framework recovers existing
multi-model variance reduction schemes as special cases. We demonstrate that
these existing strategies use recursive sampling strategies, and as a result,
their maximum possible variance reduction is limited to that of a control
variate algorithm that uses only a single low-fidelity model with known mean.
This theoretical result holds regardless of the number of low-fidelity models
and/or samples used to build the estimator. We then derive new sampling
strategies within our framework that circumvent this limitation to make
efficient use of all available information sources. In particular, we
demonstrate that a significant gap can exist, of orders of magnitude in some
cases, between the variance reduction achievable by using a single low-fidelity
model and our non-recursive approach. We also present initial sample allocation
approaches for exploiting this gap. They yield the greatest benefit when
augmenting the high-fidelity model evaluations is impractical because, for
instance, they arise from a legacy database. Several analytic examples and an
example with a hyperbolic PDE describing elastic wave propagation in
heterogeneous media are used to illustrate the main features of the
methodology.

has been carried out in dynamic control of PMAs. One reason is that PMAs are
highly hysteretic. Coupled with their high compliance and response lag, PMAs
are challenging to control, particularly when subjected to external loads. The
hysteresis models proposed to-date rely on many physical and mechanical
parameters that are difficult to measure reliably and therefore of limited use
for implementing dynamic control. In this work, we employ a Bouc-Wen hysteresis
modeling approach to account for the hysteresis of PMAs and use the model for
implementing dynamic control. The controller is then compared to PID feedback
control for a number of dynamic position tracking tests. The dynamic control
based on the Bouc-Wen hysteresis model shows significantly better tracking
performance. This work lays the foundation towards implementing dynamic control
for PMA-powered high degrees of freedom soft and continuum robots.

FS reconstruction has been observed in optimal- and over-doped regime
(x=0.15-0.17) by quantum oscillation measurements (QOM). This is all the more
puzzling because neutron scattering suggests that the antiferromagnetic (AFM)
long-range order, which is believed to reconstruct the FS, vanishes before
x=0.14. To reconcile the conflict, a widely discussed external magnetic
field-induced AFM long-range order in QOM explains the FS reconstruction as an
extrinsic property. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES)
evidence of FS reconstruction in optimal- and over-doped NCCO. The observed FSs
are in quantitative agreement with QOM, suggesting an intrinsic FS
reconstruction without field. This reconstructed FS, despite its importance as
a basis to understand electron-doped cuprates, cannot be explained under the
traditional scheme. Furthermore, the energy gap of the reconstruction decreases
rapidly near x=0.17 like an order parameter, echoing the quantum critical
doping in transport. The totality of the data points to a mysterious order
between x=0.14 and 0.17, whose appearance favors the FS reconstruction and
disappearance defines the quantum critical doping. A recent topological
proposal provides an ansatz for its origin.

global galaxy population. Because of the unusual dense environment of clusters,
their evolution is driven by different mechanisms than the ones affecting field
or central galaxies. Understanding the different interactions they are subject
to, and how they are influenced by them, is therefore an important step towards
explaining the global picture of galaxy evolution. In this paper, we use the
publicly-available high resolution hydrodynamical simulation Illustris-1 to
study satellite galaxies in the three most massive host haloes (with masses
$M_{200} > 10^{14}\,h^{-1}\rm{M}_{\odot}$) at $z=0$. We measure the
Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation (hereafter SHMR) of the galaxies, and find that
for satellites it is shifted towards lower halo masses compared to the SHMR of
central galaxies. We provide simple fitting functions for both the central and
satellite SHMR. To explain the shift between the two, we follow the satellite
galaxies since their time of accretion into the clusters, and quantify the
impact of dark matter stripping and star formation. We find that subhaloes
start losing their dark matter as soon as they get closer than $\sim 1.5\times
R_{\rm{vir}}$ to the centre of their host, and that up to 80\% of their dark
matter content gets stripped during infall. On the other hand, star formation
quenching appears to be delayed, and galaxies continue to form stars for a few
Gyr after accretion. The combination of these two effects impacts the ratio of
stellar to dark matter mass which varies drastically during infall, from 0.03
to 0.3.

exploits ISA similarities for lowering DBT cost.

conditional multinomial logit models from discrete choice and random utility
theory, in which each new edge is viewed as a ""choice"" made by a node to
connect to another node, based on (generic) features of the other nodes
available to make a connection. This perspective on network formation unifies
existing models such as preferential attachment, triadic closure, and node
fitness, which are all special cases, and thereby provides a flexible means for
conceptualizing, estimating, and comparing models. The lens of discrete choice
theory also provides several new tools for analyzing social network formation;
for example, the significance of node features can be evaluated in a
statistically rigorous manner, and mixtures of existing models can be estimated
by adapting known expectation-maximization algorithms. We demonstrate the
flexibility of our framework through examples that analyze a number of
synthetic and real-world datasets. For example, we provide rigorous methods for
estimating preferential attachment models and show how to separate the effects
of preferential attachment and triadic closure. Non-parametric estimates of the
importance of degree show a highly linear trend, and we expose the importance
of looking carefully at nodes with degree zero. Examining the formation of a
large citation graph, we find evidence for an increased role of degree when

response in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, we propose a heuristic
multi-agent reinforcement learning scheduling algorithm, named as ResQ, which
can effectively schedule the rapid deployment of volunteers to rescue victims
in dynamic settings. The core concept is to quickly identify victims and
volunteers from social network data and then schedule rescue parties with an
adaptive learning algorithm. This framework performs two key functions: 1)
identify trapped victims and rescue volunteers, and 2) optimize the volunteers'
rescue strategy in a complex time-sensitive environment. The proposed ResQ
algorithm can speed up the training processes through a heuristic function
which reduces the state-action space by identifying the set of particular
actions over others. Experimental results showed that the proposed heuristic
multi-agent reinforcement learning based scheduling outperforms several
state-of-art methods, in terms of both reward rate and response times.

inspiration from reinforcement learning (RL) and treat the generation of each

a flexible recurrent neural network and gradually improve the policy to mimic
the observed event distribution. Since the reward function is unknown in this

microstructural evolution in this pseudo-ternary system within spinodal regions

is predicted after a sufficiently deep potential well is established in the

once the fireball forms the plasma potential rapidly increases, resulting in
electrons being only lost to the electrode.Previous predictions suggest that
once formed the fireball double layer must maintain a potential close to the
ionization potential of the neutral gas to remain in a steady state. In this
paper, it is predicted that changes in electrode bias after formation results
in a corresponding change in fireball size and plasma potential. This change in
plasma potential allows the double layer potential to be maintained at biases
both above and below the electrode bias at onset. The fireball extinguishes
when the required double layer potential can no longer be maintained with
balance of current loss of the bulk plasma. These predictions are tested
experimentally and are found to be in good agreement with the measurements.

separating/reattaching flows of the ratio $\delta_e/h$, where $\delta_e$ is the
thickness at separation of the incoming boundary layer and $h$ the
characteristic cross-stream scale of the flow. In the present study, we propose
an original approach based on mean mass entrainment, which is the driving
mechanism accounting for the growth of the separated shear layer. The focus is
on mass transfer at the Turbulent/Non-Turbulent Interface (TNTI). In
particular, the scaling of the TNTI, which is well documented in turbulent
boundary layers, is used to trace changes in the scaling properties of the
flow. To emphasise the influence of the incoming boundary layer, two
geometrically similar, descending ramps with sizeably different heights $h$ but
fundamentally similar values of $\delta_e$ are compared. The distribution in
space of the TNTI highlights a sizeable footprint of the incoming boundary
layer on the separated flow, the scaling of which results of the competition
between $h$ and $\delta_e$. On the basis of a simple mass budget within the
neighbourhood of separation, we propose to model this competition by
introducing the scaling factor $C_{h,\delta} = 1 + \delta_e/h$. With this
model, we demonstrate that the relationship between shear layer growth and mass
entrainment rates established for free shear layers (i.e. $\delta_e = 0$) might
be extended to flows where $\delta_e/h > 0$. Since many control systems rely on
mass entrainment to modify separation properties, our findings suggest that the
parameter $\delta_e/h$ needs to be taken into account when choosing the most
relevant strategies for controlling or predicting separating/reattaching flows.

class of semilinear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with
multiplicative noise. The nonlinearity in the diffusion term of the SPDEs is
assumed to be globally Lipschitz and the nonlinearity in the drift term is only
assumed to satisfy a one-side Lipschitz condition. The semilinear SPDEs
considered in this paper is a direct generalization of the SODEs considered in
[13]. There are several difficulties which need to be overcome for this
generalization. First, obviously the spatial discretization, which does not
appear in the SODE case, adds an extra layer of difficulty. It turns out a
special discretization must be designed to guarantee certain properties for the
numerical scheme and its stiffness matrix. In this paper we use a finite
element interpolation technique to discretize the nonlinear drift term. Second,
in order to prove the strong convergence of the proposed fully discrete finite
element method, stability estimates for higher order moments of the
$H^1$-seminorm of the numerical solution must be established, which are
difficult and delicate. A judicious combination of the properties of the drift
and diffusion terms and a nontrivial technique borrowed from [16] is used in
this paper to achieve the goal. Finally, stability estimates for the second and
higher order moments of the $L^2$-norm of the numerical solution is also
difficult to obtain due to the fact that the mass matrix may not be diagonally
dominant. This is done by utilizing the interpolation theory and the higher
moment estimates for the $H^1$-seminorm of the numerical solution. After
overcoming these difficulties, it is proved that the proposed fully discrete
finite element method is convergent in strong norms with nearly optimal rates
of convergence.

Properties of the obtained solution have been examined carefully. We also
investigate the thermodynamics of the given black hole. To obtain thermodynamic
functions, namely its entropy we use the Wald procedure which is suitable for
quite general diffeomorphism-invariant theories. The applied approach allowed
us to obtain the expression for entropy and the first law of black hole
thermodynamics. Having introduced thermodynamic pressure which is related to
the cosmological constant we have examined thermodynamics of the black hole in
the so called extended phase space. The extended phase space and specifically
chosen scalar `charge' allowed us not only to obtain the generalized first law
but also derive the Smarr relation. The behaviour of black hole's temperature,

especially when differentiating complex algorithms and mathematical functions.
The implementation of automatic differentiation however requires some care to
insure efficiency. Modern differentiation packages deploy a broad range of
computational techniques to improve applicability, run time, and memory
management. Among these techniques are operation overloading, region based
memory, and expression templates. There also exist several mathematical
techniques which can yield high performance gains when applied to complex
algorithms. For example, semi-analytical derivatives can reduce by orders of
magnitude the runtime required to numerically solve and differentiate an
algebraic equation. Open problems include the extension of current packages to
provide more specialized routines, and efficient methods to perform
higher-order differentiation.

short-lived radioisotope (SLRI) $^{26}$Al have remained fairly constant since
1976, while estimates for the initial abundance of the SLRI $^{60}$Fe have
varied widely recently. At the high end of this range, $^{60}$Fe initial
abundances have seemed to require $^{60}$Fe nucleosynthesis in a core collapse
supernova, followed by incorporation into primitive meteoritical components
within $\sim$ 1 Myr. This paper continues the detailed exploration of this
classical scenario, using models of the self-gravitational collapse of
molecular cloud cores that have been struck by suitable shock fronts, leading
to the injection of shock front gas into the collapsing cloud through
Rayleigh-Taylor fingers formed at the shock-cloud interface. As before, these
models are calculated using the FLASH three dimensional, adaptive mesh
refinement (AMR), gravitational hydrodynamical code. While the previous models
used FLASH 2.5, the new models employ FLASH 4.3, which allows sink particles to
be introduced to represent the newly formed protostellar object. Sink particles
permit the models to be pushed forward farther in time to the phase where a
$\sim 1 M_\odot$ protostar has formed, orbited by a rotating protoplanetary
disk. These models are thus able to define what type of target cloud core is
necessary for the supernova triggering scenario to produce a plausible scheme
for the injection of SLRIs into the presolar cloud core: a $\sim 3 M_\odot$
cloud core rotating at a rate of $\sim 3 \times 10^{-14}$ rad s$^{-1}$ or
higher.

stochastic molecular dynamics methods that aim at sampling a canonical
ensemble. While this is expected for real systems, discretization errors
introduced by the numerical integration may distort such assumption.
Fortunately, backward error analysis allows us to identify the quantity that is
actually subject to equipartition. This is related to a shadow Hamiltonian,
which coincides with the specified Hamiltonian only when the time-step size
approaches zero. This paper deals with discretization effects in a
straightforward way. With a small computational overhead, we obtain refined
versions of the kinetic and potential energies, whose sum is a suitable
estimator of the shadow Hamiltonian. Then, we tune the thermostatting procedure
by employing the refined kinetic energy instead of the conventional one. This
procedure is shown to reproduce a canonical ensemble compatible with the
refined system, as opposed to the original one, but canonical averages
regarding the latter can be easily recovered by reweighting. Water, modeled as
a rigid body, is an excellent test case for our proposal because its numerical
stability extends up to time steps large enough to yield pronounced
discretization errors in Verlet-type integrators. By applying our new approach,
we were able to mitigate discretization effects in equilibrium properties of
liquid water for time-step sizes up to 5 fs.

Henniart deduced the following theorem: If $F$ is a nonarchimedean local field
and if $\pi$ is an irreducible admissible representation of $GL(n,F)$, then,
after a finite sequence of cyclic base changes, the image of $\pi$ contains a
vector fixed under an Iwahori subgroup. This result was indispensable in all
proofs of the local Langlands correspondence. Scholze later gave a different
proof, based on the analysis of nearby cycles in the cohomology of the
Lubin-Tate tower.
  Let $G$ be a reductive group over $F$. Assuming a theory of stable cyclic
base change exists for $G$, we define an incorrigible supercuspidal
representation $\pi$ of $G(F)$ to be one with the property that, after any
sequence of cyclic base changes, the image of $\pi$ contains a supercuspidal
member. If F is of positive characteristic then we define $\pi$ to be pure if
the Langlands parameter attached to $\pi$ by Genestier and Lafforgue is pure in
an appropriate sense. We conjecture that no pure supercuspidal representation
is incorrigible. We prove this conjecture for $GL(n)$ and for classical groups,
using properties of standard $L$-functions; and we show how this gives rise to
a proof of Henniart's theorem and the local Langlands correspondence for
$GL(n)$ based on V. Lafforgue's Langlands parametrization, and thus independent
of point-counting on Shimura or Drinfel'd modular varieties.

potential reduction of motor energy consumption and peak power, though these
benefits are highly dependent on the design of the torque-elongation profile of
the elastic element. In the case of linear springs, natural dynamics is a
traditional method for this design, but it has two major limitations: arbitrary
load trajectories are difficult or impossible to analyze and it does not
consider actuator constraints. Parametric optimization is also a popular design
method that addresses these limitations, but solutions are only optimal within
the space of the parameters. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
non-parametric convex optimization program for the design of the nonlinear
elastic element that minimizes energy consumption and peak power for an
arbitrary periodic reference trajectory. To obtain convexity, we introduce a
convex approximation to the expression of peak power; energy consumption is
shown to be convex without approximation. The combination of peak power and
energy consumption in the cost function leads to a multiobjective convex
optimization framework that comprises the main contribution of this paper. As a
case study, we recover the elongation-torque profile of a cubic spring, given
its natural oscillation as the reference load. We then design nonlinear SEAs
for an ankle prosthesis that minimize energy consumption and peak power for
different trajectories and extend the range of achievable tasks when subject to
actuator constraints.

responses to gesture generation, the time course of gesture processing is not
well understood. Specifically, it is not clear if or how particular
characteristics within the kinematic execution of gestures capture attention
and aid in the classification of gestures with communicative intent. If indeed
key features of gestures with perceptual saliency exist, such features could
help form the basis of a compact representation of the gestures in memory.
Methods: This study used a set of available gesture videos as stimuli. The
timing for salient features of performed gestures was determined by isolating
inflection points in the hands' motion trajectories. Participants passively
viewed the gesture videos while continuous EEG data was collected. We focused
on mu oscillations (10 Hz) and used linear regression to test for associations
between the timing of mu oscillations and inflection points in motion
trajectories. Results: Peaks in the EEG signals at central and occipital
electrodes were used to isolate the salient events within each gesture. EEG
power oscillations were detected 343 and 400ms on average after inflection
points at occipital and central electrodes, respectively. A regression model
showed that inflection points in the motion trajectories strongly predicted
subsequent mu oscillations (R^2=0.961, p<.01). Conclusion: The results suggest
that coordinated activity in the visual and motor cortices are highly
correlated with key motion components within gesture trajectories. These points
may be associated with neural signatures used to encode gestures in memory for
later identification and even recognition.

back to physical and spatial properties of the gas. By increasing the spatial
resolution alone, the total luminosity of the line emission increases by an
order of magnitude. This increase arises in the abundance of dense small-scale
structure resolved when the CGM gas is simulated to < 100 pc scales. Current
integral field unit instruments like KCWI and MUSE should be able to detect the
brightest knots and filaments of such emission, and from this to infer the bulk
kinematics of the CGM gas with respect to the galaxy. We conclude that
accounting for small-scale structure well below the level of instrument spatial

  pages of appendices",,,,"stat.CO stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Zero-variance control variates (ZV-CV) are a post-processing method to reduce
the variance of Monte Carlo estimators of expectations using the derivatives of
the log target. Once the derivatives are available, the only additional
computational effort lies in solving a linear regression problem. Significant
variance reductions have been achieved with this method in low dimensional
examples, but the number of covariates in the regression rapidly increases with
the dimension of the target. In this paper, we present compelling empirical
evidence that the use of penalized regression techniques in the selection of
high-dimensional control variates provides performance gains over the classical
least squares method. Another type of regularization based on using subsets of
derivatives, or a priori regularization as we refer to it in this paper, is
also proposed to reduce computational and storage requirements. Several
examples showing the utility and limitations of regularized ZV-CV for Bayesian
inference are given. The methods proposed in this paper are accessible through
the R package ZVCV.

Multiple frequency analyses were performed for the light residuals in the

larger than 4.0 in two regions of 0.62$-$6.28 day$^{-1}$ and 19.36$-$24.07

Nyquist limit $f_{\rm Ny}$ may be reflections of real pulsation frequencies
(2$f_{\rm Ny}-f_i$). All frequencies ($f_8$, $f_9$, $f_{14}$, $f_{18}$,
$f_{24}$, $f_{32}$) in the lower frequency region are orbital harmonics, and
three high frequencies ($f_{19}$, $f_{20}$, $f_{22}$) appear to be sidelobes
split from the main frequency of $f_1$ = 22.77503 day$^{-1}$. Most of them are
thought to be alias effects caused by the orbital frequency. For the 26 other

0.041$-$0.052 days and 0.013$-$0.016 days, respectively. These values and the

matrices of order 27 and a new set of good matrices of order 57. We also find
that circulant good matrices do not exist in the orders 51, 63, and 69, thereby
finding three new counterexamples to the conjecture that such matrices exist in
all odd orders. Additionally, we prove a new relationship between the entries

  Aberration for Direct Imaging of Exoplanets","12 pages, no figures",,,,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the major difficulties limiting ground-based direct imaging of
exoplanets with adaptive optics is quasi-static speckles in the science camera
(SC) that obscure the planetary image. These speckles are caused by
aberrations, called non-common path aberrations (NCPA), that are not corrected
in the adaptive optics loop, and all attempts to subtract them in
post-processing have been problematic. The method of Frazin (2013) (F13) uses
simultaneous millisecond telemetry from wavefront sensor (WFS) and the SC to
estimate the both the NCPA and the exoplanet image in a self-consistent manner.
Rodack et al. (2018) proposed correcting for the NCPA in real-time while on-sky
using the F13 estimation method, and called this procedure the ""Real-Time
Frazin Algorithm."" The original regression model underlying the F13 method did
not account for uncertainty in the WFS measurements, and this cannot be done
with standard statistical methodology since these uncertainties manifest
themselves in the independent variables (i.e., they cannot be treated as
another source of noise in the SC data). Further, simulations show that simply
using the noisy wavefront measurements without accounting for their
uncertainties leads to estimates of the NCPA with unacceptably large bias.
Here, the source of this bias is explained in terms of an ""errors in variables""
statistical model. Then, the method of F13 is generalized to account for WFS
measurement error using a new sequential estimation technique that treats the
nonlinear coupling between NCPA, WFS measurements and the error covariance of
the WFS measurements. This new technique keeps a running estimate of the NCPA,
the exoplanet image and their joint covariance matrix. The sequential
implementation of the method should make it computationally efficient enough to
be suitable for on-sky correction of the NCPA as well as off-line analysis.

paired with those on the other. In its online variant, one side of the graph is
available offline, while the vertices on the other side arrive online. When a
vertex arrives, an irrevocable and immediate decision should be made by the
algorithm; either match it to an available vertex or drop it. Examples of such
problems include matching workers to firms, advertisers to keywords, organs to
patients, and so on. Much of the literature focuses on maximizing the total
relevance---modeled via total weight---of the matching. However, in many
real-world problems, it is also important to consider contributions of
diversity: hiring a diverse pool of candidates, displaying a relevant but
diverse set of ads, and so on. In this paper, we propose the Online Submodular
Bipartite Matching (\osbm) problem, where the goal is to maximize a submodular
function $f$ over the set of matched edges. This objective is general enough to
capture the notion of both diversity (\emph{e.g.,} a weighted coverage
function) and relevance (\emph{e.g.,} the traditional linear function)---as
well as many other natural objective functions occurring in practice
(\emph{e.g.,} limited total budget in advertising settings). We propose novel
algorithms that have provable guarantees and are essentially optimal when
restricted to various special cases. We also run experiments on real-world and
synthetic datasets to validate our algorithms.

weights that change linearly with a parameter $\lambda$ such that, as $\lambda$
varies in $(-\infty,+\infty)$, the piece-wise linear cost of the shortest path
from $s$ to $t$ has $n^{\Omega(\log n)}$ pieces. This shows that lower bounds
obtained earlier by Carstensen (1983) and Mulmuley \& Shah (2001) for general
graphs also hold for planar graphs, thereby refuting a conjecture of Nikolova
(2009). Gusfield (1980) and Dean (2009) showed that the number of pieces for
every $n$-vertex graph with linear edge weights is $n^{\log n + O(1)}$. We
generalize this result in two ways. (i) If the edge weights vary as a
polynomial of degree at most $d$, then the number of pieces is $n^{\log n +
(\alpha(n)+O(1))^d}$, where $\alpha(n)$ is the slow growing inverse Ackermann
function. (ii) If the edge weights are linear forms of three parameters, then
the number of pieces, appropriately defined for $\mathbb{R}^3$, is $n^{(\log
n)^2+O(\log n)}$.

This book explores an alternative idea where the future of science is based on
the language of algorithms and programs. How such a language can actually be
implemented in the sciences is outlined in some detail. We start by
constructing a simple formal system where statements are represented as
programs and inference is based on computability as opposed to the classical
notion of truth value assignments.
  The focus is on theories where the intrinsic properties and dynamic state of
real world objects can be defined in terms of information and subject to laws
based on simple deterministic rules and finite state arithmetic. Such models,
it is argued, not only offer alternative simulation tools, as opposed to those
based on discrete approximations of conventional continuum theories, but in
themselves can be regarded as a language that describes the physical laws at a
fundamental level. This book does not examine any specific application in
detail but rather attempts to lay down a foundation for the validation of such
theories by employing the inference scheme based on computability logic.

  Recurrent Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been widely used in processing natural
language tasks and achieve huge success. Traditional RNNs usually treat each
token in a sentence uniformly and equally. However, this may miss the rich
semantic structure information of a sentence, which is useful for understanding
natural languages. Since semantic structures such as word dependence patterns
are not parameterized, it is a challenge to capture and leverage structure
information. In this paper, we propose an improved variant of RNN,
Multi-Channel RNN (MC-RNN), to dynamically capture and leverage local semantic
structure information. Concretely, MC-RNN contains multiple channels, each of
which represents a local dependence pattern at a time. An attention mechanism
is introduced to combine these patterns at each step, according to the semantic
information. Then we parameterize structure information by adaptively selecting
the most appropriate connection structures among channels. In this way, diverse
local structures and dependence patterns in sentences can be well captured by
MC-RNN. To verify the effectiveness of MC-RNN, we conduct extensive experiments
on typical natural language processing tasks, including neural machine
translation, abstractive summarization, and language modeling. Experimental
results on these tasks all show significant improvements of MC-RNN over current
top systems.

with additive noise. With suitable parametrization of the signal sparsity and
magnitude of its non-zero components, we characterize a phase-transition
phenomenon akin to the signal detection problem studied by Ingster in 1998.
Specifically, if the signal magnitude is above the so-called strong
classification boundary, we show that several classes of well-known procedures
achieve asymptotically perfect support recovery as the dimension goes to
infinity. This is so, for a very broad class of error distributions with light,
rapidly varying tails which may have arbitrary dependence. Conversely, if the
signal is below the boundary, then for a very broad class of error dependence
structures, no thresholding estimators (including ones with data-dependent
thresholds) can achieve perfect support recovery. The proofs of these results
exploit a certain concentration of maxima phenomenon known as relative
stability. We provide a complete characterization of the relative stability
phenomenon for Gaussian triangular arrays in terms their correlation structure.
The proof uses classic Sudakov-Fernique and Slepian lemma arguments along with
a curious application of Ramsey's coloring theorem.
  We note that our study of the strong classification boundary is in a finer,
point-wise, rather than minimax, sense. We also establish the Bayes optimality
and sub-optimality of thresholding procedures. Consequently, we obtain a
minimax-type characterization of the strong classification boundary for errors
with log-concave densities.

intrinsic distributed computation, useful for the description of the dynamical
complexity of several physical and biological processes. Here we introduce a
parametric framework which allows to compute information storage across
multiple time scales in stochastic processes displaying both short-term
dynamics and long-range correlations (LRC). The framework exploits the theory
of state space models to provide the multiscale representation of linear
fractionally integrated autoregressive (ARFI) processes, from which information
storage is computed at any given time scale relating the process variance to
the prediction error variance. This enables the theoretical assessment and a
computationally reliable quantification of a complexity measure which
incorporates the effects of LRC together with that of short-term dynamics. The
proposed measure is first assessed in simulated ARFI processes reproducing
different types of autoregressive (AR) dynamics and different degrees of LRC,
studying both the theoretical values and the finite sample performance. We find
that LRC alter substantially the complexity of ARFI processes even at short
time scales, and that reliable estimation of complexity can be achieved at
longer time scales only when LRC are properly modeled. Then, we assess
multiscale information storage in physiological time series measured in humans
during resting state and postural stress, revealing unprecedented responses to
stress of the complexity of heart period and systolic arterial pressure
variability, which are related to the different role played by LRC in the two
conditions.

we study the fate of this topological invariant when inversion symmetry is
added while time-reversal symmetry is not enforced. There are two ways to add
inversion symmetry, leading to space groups No.~13 and No.~14. In space group
No.~13, we find that the glide-$Z_2$ invariant is expressed solely from the
irreducible representations at high-symmetry points in $k$-space. It
constitutes the $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry-based indicator for
this space group, together with another $\mathbb{Z}_2$ representing the Chern
number modulo 2. In space group No.~14, we find that the symmetry-based
indicator $\mathbb{Z}_2$ is given by a combination of the glide-$Z_2$ invariant
and the Chern number. Thus, in space group No.~14, from the irreducible
representations at high-symmetry points we can only know possible combinations
of the glide-$Z_2$ invariant and the Chern number, but in order to know each
value of these topological numbers, we should calculate integrals of the Berry
curvature. Finally, we show that in both cases, the symmetry-based indicator
$\mathbb{Z}_4$ for inversion symmetric systems leading to the higher-order
topological insulators is directly related with the glide-$Z_2$ invariant and

system data integrity is considered. The placement problem is motivated from
the data secure power network design applications in [Dan and Sandberg 2010].
The problem is shown to be NP-hard and an integer linear programming
formulation is provided based on the topological observability condition by
[Krumpholz, Clements and Davis 1980]. The incorporation of the observability
condition requires a graph connectivity constraint which is found to be most
effectively described by the Miller-Tucker-Zemlin (MTZ) conditions. For a
specialization without line power flow measurements, the protection placement
problem can be modeled by a domination type integer linear program much easier
to solve than the general formulation requiring graph connectivity. Numerical
studies with IEEE benchmark and other large power systems with more than 2000
buses indicate that using the proposed formulations, the protection placement
problem can be solved in negligible amount of time in realistic application
settings.

poor manufacturing yield. A demanding solution to this problem is redundant via
insertion during post-routing optimization. It becomes very critical when a
multi-layer routing solution already incurs a large number of vias. Very few
global routers addressed unconstrained via minimization (UVM) problem, while
using minimal pattern routing and layer assignment of nets. It also includes a
recent floorplan based early global routability assessment tool STAIRoute
\cite{karb2}.
  This work addresses an early version of unconstrained via minimization
problem during early global routing by identifying a set of minimal bend
routing regions in any floorplan, by a new recursive bipartitioning framework.
These regions facilitate monotone pattern routing of a set of nets in the
floorplan by STAIRoute. The area/number balanced floorplan bipartitionining is
a multi-objective optimization problem and known to be NP-hard \cite{majum2}.
No existing approaches considered bend minimization as an objective and some of
them incurred higher runtime overhead. In this paper, we present a Greedy as
well as randomized neighbor search based staircase wave-front propagation
methods for obtaining optimal bipartitioning results for minimal bend routing
through multiple routing layers, for a balanced trade-off between routability,
wirelength and congestion.
  Experiments were conducted on MCNC/GSRC floorplanning benchmarks for studying
the variation of early via count obtained by STAIRoute for different values of
the trade-off parameters ($\gamma, \beta$) in this multi-objective optimization
problem, using $8$ metal layers. We studied the impact of ($\gamma, \beta$)

systems of colloidal microrollers; microrollers are colloidal particles which
rotate about an axis parallel to the floor and generate strong, slowly
decaying, advective flows. To understand these bound states, we study a simple,
yet rich, model system of two microrollers. Here we show that pairs of
microrollers can exhibit hydrodynamic bound states whose nature depends on a
dimensionless number, denoted $B$, that compares the relative strength of
gravitational forces and external torques. Using a dynamical system framework,
we characterize these various states in phase space and analyze the
bifurcations of the system as $B$ varies. In particular, we show that there is
a critical value, $B^*$, above which active flows can beat gravity and lead to
stable motile orbiting, or ""leapfrog"", trajectories, reminiscent of the
self-assembled motile structures, called ""critters"", observed by Driscoll
\textit{et al}. We identify the conditions for the emergence of these
trajectories and study their basin of attraction. This work shows that a wide
variety of stable bound states can be obtained with only two particles.

given a desired signature, a set of input-output examples, and a collection of
libraries (without formal specifications). FrAngel aims to discover programs
with many distinct behaviors by combining two main ideas. First, it mines code
fragments from partially-successful programs that only pass some of the
examples. These extracted fragments are often useful for synthesis due to a
property that we call special-case similarity. Second, FrAngel uses angelic
conditions as placeholders for control structure conditions and optimistically
evaluates the resulting program sketches. Angelic conditions decompose the
synthesis process: FrAngel first finds promising partial programs and later
fills in their missing conditions. We demonstrate that FrAngel can synthesize a
variety of interesting programs with combinations of control structures within

Highorder harmonic generation from these systems is particularly interesting
because it provides high flux beams of ultrashort extreme ultraviolet
radiation. A lot of efforts have been devoted to optimize the macroscopic
generation parameters. Here we investigate the possibility of enhancing the
single-atom response by producing high-harmonics from the second, third and
fourth harmonics of a turnkey Yb-fiber laser at 1030 nm. We show that the
harmonic efficiency is optimal when the process is driven by the third
harmonic, producing 4.4 1014 photon/s at 18 eV, which corresponds to 1.3 mW
average power.

observational evidence for their existence is a notoriously difficult task.
Current strategies to quantify the evidence for BHs all boil down to looking
for signs of highly compact, horizonless bodies. Here, we study particle
creation by objects which collapse to form ultra-compact configurations, with
surface at an areal radius $R=R_{f}$ satisfying $1-(2M/R_{f})= \epsilon^{2}\ll
1$ with $M$ the object mass. We assume that gravitational collapse proceeds in
a `standard' manner until $R=R_{f}+2M \epsilon^{2\beta}$, where $\beta>0$, and
then slows down to form a static object of radius $R_{f}$. In the standard
collapsing phase, Hawking-like thermal radiation is emitted, which is as strong
as the Hawking radiation of a BH with the same mass but lasts only for $\sim
40~(M/M_{\odot})[44+\ln (10^{-19}/\epsilon)]~\mu \mbox{s}$. Thereafter, in a
very large class of models, there exist two bursts of radiation separated by a
very long dormant stage. The first burst occurs at the end of the transient
Hawking radiation, and is followed by a quiescent stage which lasts for $\sim
6\times 10^{6}~(\epsilon/10^{-19})^{-1}(M/M_{\odot})~\mbox{yr}$. Afterwards,
the second burst is triggered, after which there is no more particle production
and the star is forever dark. In a model with $\beta=1$, both the first and
second bursts outpower the transient Hawking radiation by a factor $\sim
10^{38}(\epsilon/10^{-19})^{-2}$.

anthropology the gender determination of the subject (hit by a disastrous or
any kind of traumatic situation) is mostly the first step. In state-of-the-art
techniques the gender is determined by examining dimensions of the bones of
skull and the pelvis area. In worse situations when there is only a small
portion of the human remains to be investigated and the subject is a child, we
need alternative techniques to determine the gender of the subject. In this
work we propose a technique called GDCNN (Gender Determination with
Convolutional Neural Networks), where the left hand radio-graphs of the
children between a wide range of ages in 1 month to 18 years are examined to
determine the gender. To our knowledge this technique is first of its kind.
Further to identify the area of the attention we used Class Activation Mapping
(CAM). Results: The results suggest the accuracy of the model is as high as
98%, which is very convincing by taking into account the incompletely grown
skeleton of the children. The attention observed with CAM discovers that the
lower part of the hand around carpals (wrist) is more important for child
gender determination.

this work, we first point out that the essential effect of the two disharmonies

harmonizing mechanism (GHM) to be a hedging for the disharmonies. The
philosophy behind GHM can be easily embedded into both classification loss

seismic data of more than two years is evaluated from the point of view of the
Einstein Telescope, a proposed third generation underground gravitational wave

  Networks","pre-print of paper accepted by Results in Mathematics",,,,"math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new non-linear variant of a quantitative extension of the uniform
boundedness principle is used to show sharpness of error bounds for univariate
approximation by sums of sigmoid and ReLU functions. Single hidden layer
feedforward neural networks with one input node perform such operations. Errors
of best approximation can be expressed using moduli of smoothness of the
function to be approximated (i.e., to be learned). In this context, the
quantitative extension of the uniform boundedness principle indeed allows to
construct counter examples that show approximation rates to be best possible.
Approximation errors do not belong to the little-o class of given bounds. By
choosing piecewise linear activation functions, the discussed problem becomes
free knot spline approximation. Results of the present paper also hold for
non-polynomial (and not piecewise defined) activation functions like inverse
tangent. Based on Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, first results are shown for
the logistic function.

interacting quantum mixtures confined in one dimension and subjected to a
harmonic external potential. Such strongly correlated systems can be realized
and tested in ultracold atoms experiments. Their non-trivial permutational
symmetry properties are investigated, as well as their interplay with
correlations. Exploiting an exact solution at strong interactions, we extract
general correlation properties encoded in the one-body density matrix and in
the associated momentum distributions, in fermionic and Bose-Fermi mixtures. In
particular, we obtain substantial results about the short-range behavior, and
therefore the high-momentum tails, which display typical $k^{-4}$ laws. The
weights of these tails, denoted as Tan's contacts, are related to numerous
thermodynamic properties of the systems such as the two-body correlations, the
derivative of the energy with respect to the one-dimensional scattering length,
or the static structure factor. We show that these universal Tan's contacts
also allow to characterize the spatial symmetry of the systems, and therefore
is a deep connection between correlations and symmetries. Besides, the exchange
symmetry is extracted using a group theory method, namely the class-sum method,
which comes originally from nuclear physics. Moreover, we show that these
systems follow a generalized version of the famous Lieb-Mattis theorem. Wishing
to make our results as experimentally relevant as possible, we derive scaling
laws for Tan's contact as a function of the interaction, temperature and
transverse confinement. These laws display interesting effects related to
strong correlations and dimensionality.

very thin silica system on a substrate which can be basically described as a 2D
random network. The key structural properties, in particular related to the
ring statistics, could be numerically reproduced by performing molecular
dynamics simulations with an appropriately chosen 2D force field. Using a
maximum entropy formulation it is shown that the probability distribution of
the individual rings and triplets can be related to the ring and triplet
energies, respectively, obtained from the simulations. Using additional
Lagrange parameters, the correct average properties of random networks are
guaranteed. In agreement with previous work, based on distributions of
complementary rings and triplets, respectively, one finds a Boltzmann-type
relation albeit with an effective temperature which largely deviates from the
bath temperature. Furthermore, it is shown that the ring and triplet energies
can be estimated based on the properties of their average inner angles. This
calculation supports, on a quantitative level, the previously suggested angle
mismatch theory. It suggests that correlations among adjacent rings originate
from the net mismatch in the inner ring angles in a triplet of rings. By taking
into account an average effect from the surrounding rings of a triplet, an even
better estimate of the correlations can be provided. That approach is also
applied to estimate of the Aboav-Wearie parameter.

towards zero phase angle, a phenomenon known as the opposition effect (OE). Two
physical processes that are thought to be the dominant contributors to the
brightness surge are shadow hiding (SH) and coherent backscatter (CB). The
occurrence of shadow hiding in planetary regoliths is self-evident, but it has
proved difficult to unambiguously demonstrate CB from remote sensing
observations. One prediction of CB theory is the wavelength dependence of the
OE angular width. The Dawn spacecraft observed the OE on the surface of dwarf
planet Ceres. We characterize the OE over the resolved surface, including the
bright Cerealia Facula, and to find evidence for SH and/or CB. We analyze
images of the Dawn framing camera by means of photometric modeling of the phase
curve. We find that the OE of most of the investigated surface has very similar
characteristics, with an enhancement factor of 1.4 and a FWHM of 3{\deg} (broad
OE). A notable exception are the fresh ejecta of the Azacca crater, which
display a very narrow brightness enhancement that is restricted to phase angles
$< 0.5${\deg} (narrow OE); suggestively, this is in the range in which CB is
thought to dominate. We do not find a wavelength dependence for the width of
the broad OE, and lack the data to investigate the dependence for the narrow
OE. The prediction of a wavelength-dependent CB width is rather ambiguous. The
zero-phase observations allow us to determine Ceres' visible geometric albedo
as $p_V = 0.094 \pm 0.005$. A comparison with other asteroids suggests that
Ceres' broad OE is typical for an asteroid of its spectral type, with
characteristics that are primarily linked to surface albedo. Our analysis
suggests that CB may occur on the dark surface of Ceres in a highly localized
fashion.

zero-temperature renormalization group (RG) technique. Following the work of
Kumar \emph{et al} (Phys. Rev. B {\bf 90}, 174409 (2014)), we use a
Jordan-Wigner transformation to map the spin problem into one of spinless
fermions (spinons) in the presence of a statistical gauge field, and with
nearest-neighbour interactions. While the work of Kumar \emph{et al} was
confined mostly to the plateau at $1/3$-filling (magnetisation per site) in the
XY regime, we analyse the role of inter-spinon interactions in shaping the
phases around this plateau in the entire XXZ model. The RG phase diagram
obtained contains three spin liquid phases whose position is determined as a
function of the exchange anisotropy and the energy scale for fluctuations
arising from spinon scattering. Two of these spins liquids are topologically
ordered states of matter with gapped, degenerate states on the torus. The gap
for one of these phases corresponds to the one-spinon band gap of the
Azbel-Hofstadter spectrum for the XY part of the Hamiltonian, while the other
arises from two-spinon interactions. The Heisenberg point of this problem is
found to lie within the interaction gapped spin liquid phase, in broad
agreement with a recent experimental finding. The third phase is an algebraic
spin liquid with a gapless Dirac spectrum for spinon excitations, and possess
properties that show departures from the Fermi liquid paradigm. The three phase
boundaries correspond to critical theories, and meet at a $SU(2)$-symmetric
multicritical point. This special critical point agrees well with the
gap-closing transition point predicted by Kumar \emph{et al}. We discuss the

significant influence on solar-like oscillation frequencies. The mixing-length
parameter, $\alpha$, is a key factor for the near-surface structure. In the
convection formulations used in evolution codes, the $\alpha$ is a free
parameter that needs to be properly specified. We calibrated $\alpha$ values by
matching entropy profiles of 1D envelope models with those of 3D CO$^5$BOLD
models. For such calibration, previous works concentrated on the classical
mixing-length theory (MLT). Here we also analyzed the full spectrum turbulence
(FST) models. For the atmosphere part in the 1D models, we use the Eddington
grey $T(\tau)$ relation and the one with the solar-calibrated Hopf-like
function. For both the MLT and FST models with a mixing length $l=\alpha H_p$,
calibrated $\alpha$ values increase with increasing $g$ or decreasing $T_{\rm
eff}$. For the FST models, we also calibrated values of $\alpha^*$ defined as
$l=r_{\rm top}-r+\alpha^*H_{p,{\rm top}}$. $\alpha^*$ is found to increase with
$T_{\rm eff}$ and $g$. As for the correspondence to the 3D models, the solar
Hopf-like function gives a photospheric-minimum entropy closer to a 3D model
than the Eddington $T(\tau)$. The structure below the photosphere depends on
the convection model. However, not a single convection model gives the best
correspondence since the averaged 3D quantities are not necessarily related via
an EOS. Although the FST models with $l=r_{\rm top}-r+\alpha^*H_{p,{\rm top}}$
are found to give the frequencies closest to the solar observed ones, a more
appropriate treatment of the top part of the 1D convective envelope is
necessary.

interaction driven canted antiferromagnets or weak ferrromagnets (WFM)
including hematite exhibit an ultra-slow magnetization relaxation phenomenon,
leading to the observation of a time-stable remanence (Phys. Rev. B 96, 104422
(2017)). In this work, our endeavor is to optimize the magnitude of this
time-stable remanence for the hematite crystallites, as a function of shape
size and morphology. A substantial enhancement in the magnitude of this unique
remanence is observed in porous hematite, consisting of ultra-small nano
particles, as compared to crystallites grown in regular morphology, such as
cuboids or hexagonal plates. This time-stable remanence exhibits a peak-like
pattern with magnetic field, which is significantly sharper in porous sample.
The extent and the magnitude of the spin canting associated with the WFM phase
can be best gauged by the presence of this remanence and its unusual magnetic
field dependence. Temperature variation of lattice parameters bring out
correlations between strain effects that alter the bond length and bond angle
associated with primary super exchange paths, which in-turn systematically
alter the magnitude of the time-stable remanence. This study provides insights
regarding a long standing problems of anomalies in the magnitude of
magnetization on repeated cooling in case of hematite. Our data caps on these
anomalies, which we argue, arise due to spontaneous spin canting associated
with WFM phase. Our results also elucidate on why thermal cycling protocols
during bulk magnetization measurements are even more crucial for hematite which

impact. In general, an impact event also changes the internal compositional
distribution and drives mass ejection from the planet, which may provide the
origin of satellites. Previous studies of the impact simulation of Uranus
investigated the resultant angular momentum and the ejected mass distribution.
However, the effect of changing the initial condition of the thermal and
compositional structure is not studied. In this paper, we perform hydrodynamics
simulations for the impact events of Uranus-size ice giants composed of a water
core surrounded by a hydrogen envelope using two variant methods of the
smoothed particle hydrodynamics. We find that the higher entropy target loses
its envelope more efficiently than the low entropy target. However, the higher
entropy target gains more angular momentum than the lower entropy target since
the higher entropy target has more expanded envelope. We discuss the efficiency
of angular momentum transport and the amount of the ejected mass and find a
simple analytical model to roughly reproduce the outcomes of numerical
simulations. We suggest the range of possible initial conditions for the giant
impact on proto-Uranus that reproduces the present rotation tilt of Uranus and
sufficiently provides the total angular momentum of the satellite system that

points or particles is the most time consuming. When we use mesh-free methods
with high spatial orders, the order of the time integration should also be
high. If we use usual Runge-Kutta schemes, we need to perform the interaction
calculation multiple times per one time step. One way to reduce the number of
interaction calculations is to use Hermite schemes, which use the time
derivatives of the right hand side of differential equations, since Hermite
schemes require smaller number of interaction calculations than RK schemes do
to achieve the same order. In this paper, we construct a Hermite scheme for a
mesh-free method with high spatial orders. We performed several numerical tests
with fourth-order Hermite schemes and Runge-Kutta schemes. We found that, for
both of Hermite and Runge-Kutta schemes, the overall error is determined by the
error of spatial derivatives, for timesteps smaller than the stability limit.
The calculation cost at the timestep size of the stability limit is smaller for
Hermite schemes. Therefore, we conclude that Hermite schemes are more efficient
than Runge-Kutta schemes and thus useful for high-order mesh-free methods for
Lagrangian Hydrodynamics.

efficiency of surface or guided modes via Fermi's golden rule. To exemplify
this, a near-field force transverse to the illumination is computationally
calculated for a Huygens dipole near a metallic waveguide. We believe this

  job sizes","This paper was accepted at ACM Sigmetrics 2019",,,,"cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mean field modeling is a popular approach to assess the performance of large
scale computer systems. The evolution of many mean field models is
characterized by a set of ordinary differential equations that have a unique
fixed point. In order to prove that this unique fixed point corresponds to the
limit of the stationary measures of the finite systems, the unique fixed point
must be a global attractor. While global attraction was established for various
systems in case of exponential job sizes, it is often unclear whether these
proof techniques can be generalized to non-exponential job sizes. In this paper
we show how simple monotonicity arguments can be used to prove global
attraction for a broad class of ordinary differential equations that capture
the evolution of mean field models with hyperexponential job sizes. This class
includes both existing as well as previously unstudied load balancing schemes
and can be used for systems with either finite or infinite buffers. The main
novelty of the approach exists in using a Coxian representation for the
hyperexponential job sizes and a partial order that is stronger than the
componentwise partial order used in the exponential case.

induced by a light sterile neutrino state, utilising the BR2 reactor of
SCK$\bullet$CEN, in Belgium. The detector leverages a new hybrid technology,
utilising two distinct scintillators in a cubic array, creating a highly
segmented detector volume. A combination of 5 cm cubic polyvinyltoluene cells,
with $^6$LiF:ZnS(Ag) sheets on two faces of each cube, facilitate
reconstruction of the neutrino signals. % The polyvinyltoluene scintillator is
used as an $\overline{\nu}_e$ target for the inverse beta decay of
($\overline{\nu}_e + p \rightarrow e^{+}+n$), with the $^6$LiF:ZnS(Ag) sheets
used for associated neutron detection. Scintillation signals are read out by a
network of wavelength shifting fibres connected to multipixel photon counters.
Whilst the high granularity provides a powerful toolset to discriminate
backgrounds; by itself the segmentation also represents a challenge in terms of
homogeneity and calibration, for a consistent detector response. The search for
this light sterile neutrino implies a sensitivity to distortions of around
$\mathcal{O}$(10)\% in the energy spectrum of reactor $\overline{\nu}_e$.
Hence, a very good neutron detection efficiency, light yield and homogeneous
detector response are critical for data validation. The minimal requirements
for the SoLid physics program are a light yield and a neutron detection
efficiency larger than 40 PA/MeV/cube and 50 \% respectively. In order to
guarantee these minimal requirements, the collaboration developed a rigorous
quality assurance process for all 12800 cubic cells of the detector. To carry
out the quality assurance process, an automated calibration system called
CALIPSO was designed and constructed.

South-East. The main component of MM 1a is an elongated continuum structure,
perpendicular to the bipolar outflow, with a size of $0.141'' \times 0.050''$

chaotic departures from axisymmetric structures in some planetary nebulae. I
base my study on the assumption that at the termination of the CEE the binary
interaction forms a circumbinary thick disk that feeds the companion via an
accretion disk that launches opposite jets. I consider two processes that might
lead to the development of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities that lead to chaotic
accretion flow on to the companion. The chaotic accretion flow leads to a
variable accretion disk around the companion, hence to variable jets. In the
first process the jets inflate low-density hot bubbles in the inner regions of
the envelope. In the second process the inner boundary of the thick
circumbinary disk, that faces the center, cools by radiation thus leading to a
temperature, and hence also a pressure, increase with radius. The opposite
pressure and density gradients lead to Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. This
study further underlines the importance of exploring the termination phase of
the CEE to the understanding of the entire CEE and its outcomes.

  We propose a novel approach for anomaly detection in High Performance

different from previous approaches which where based on learning the abnormal
condition, for which there are much smaller datasets (since it is very hard to
identify them to begin with).
  We test our approach on a real supercomputer equipped with a fine-grained,
scalable monitoring infrastructure that can provide large amount of data to
characterize the system behaviour. The results are extremely promising: after
the training phase to learn the normal system behaviour, our method is capable
of detecting anomalies that have never been seen before with a very good
accuracy (values ranging between 88% and 96%).

populations in a sample of nearby and nearly face-on galaxies. The \Ha\ to FUV
flux ratio is a good relative indicator of the very recent star formation
history (SFH). As a nascent star-forming region evolves, the \Ha\ line emission
declines earlier than the UV continuum, leading to a decrease in the \Ha/FUV
ratio. Using star-forming galaxy models, sampled with a probabilistic
formalism, and allowing for a variable fraction of ionizing photons in the
clusters, we obtain the corresponding theoretical ratio \Ha/FUV to compare with
our observed flux ratios, and thus to estimate the ages of the observed
regions. We take into account the mean uncertainties and the interrelationships
between parameters when computing \Ha/FUV. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical
model where a joint probability distribution is defined to determine the
parameters (age, metallicity, IMF) from the observed data (the observed flux
ratios \Ha/FUV). The joint distribution of the parameters is described through
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables generated

the wing rotation is smart modulated and can be simplified into the advanced
$\Phi>0$, symmetrical $\Phi=0$, and delayed $\Phi<0$ modes, where $\Phi$ is the
phase between stroke reversal and wing rotation. Thus, an experiment of a
Robotic fly at Reynolds number of 240 was designed to address how insects
control the flow patterns to modulate the flight forces by the smart wing
rotation. Experimental results demonstrated that the flow pattern during a half
of stroke is featured by the formation of a spiral LEV, which has a convex
shape and connects to the trailing vortex via a tip vortex and a root vortex to
form a vortex loop. Through wing rotation, the formation of LEV is enhanced and
the pinch-off of LEV can be significantly delayed, resulting in the
stabilization of LEV and the generation of unconventional forces. In addition,
by modulating the modes of wing rotation, insects obtain distinct wing-vortex
patterns including positive, neutral, and negative camber patterns, by which
insects control the magnitude and direction of unconventional forces owing to
the wake capture mechanism. Therefore, the smart wing rotation not only
contributes to the generation of unconventional forces, but also accounts for
the control of flow pattern during insects steering maneuvers.

that a current sweep along IV-characteristic of the $\varphi_0$ junction may

between the magnetic moment and the Josephson oscillations in these junctions,
and ferromagnetic resonance when Josephson frequency coincides with the
ferromagnetic one. We demonstrate that an external electromagnetic field can
control the dynamics of magnetic moment within a current interval corresponding
to a Shapiro step and produce topological transformation of specific precession
trajectories. We demonstrate the appearance of the DC component of
superconducting current and clarify its role in the transformation of
IV-characteristics in the resonance region. Good agreement between numerical

such as aerospace or electricity production, becoming an essential component of
today's industry. To overpass the traditional capabilities of those coatings,
new functionalities and coherent responses are being integrated, opening the
field of functional and smart coatings. The aim of this paper is to present a
comprehensive review of the current state of functional and smart coatings
produced using thermal spraying deposition. It will first describe the
different thermal spraying technologies, with a focus on how different
techniques achieve the thermal and kinetic energy required to form a coating,
as well as the environment to which feedstock particles are exposed in terms of
temperature and velocity. It will then deal with the state-of-the-art
functional and smart coatings applied using thermal spraying techniques, with a
discussion on the fundamentals on which the coatings are designed, the
efficiency of its performance and the industrial applications, both current and
potential. The inherent designing flexibility of thermal sprayed functional and
smart coatings has been exploited to explore exciting new possibilities on many
different fields. Applications such as anti-bacterial and anti-fouling
coatings, superhydrophobic surfaces, electrical and heating devices for
functional coatings and self-healing, self-lubricating and sensors for smart

the way for the numerous applications that are to come in the next decade,

The contextual nature of a theory is often witnessed via the violation of
non-contextuality inequalities---certain linear inequalities involving
probabilities of measurement events. Using the exclusivity graph approach (one
of the two main graph theoretic approaches for studying contextuality), it was
shown [PRA 88, 032104 (2013); Annals of mathematics, 51-299 (2006)] that a
necessary and sufficient condition for witnessing contextuality is the presence
of an odd number of events (greater than three) which are either cyclically or
anti-cyclically exclusive. Thus, the non-contextuality inequalities whose
underlying exclusivity structure is as stated, either cyclic or anti-cyclic,
are fundamental to quantum theory. We show that there is a unique
non-contextuality inequality for each non-trivial cycle and anti-cycle. In
addition to the foundational interest, we expect this to aid the understanding
of contextuality as a resource to quantum computing and its applications to

Although 3D face reconstruction has being developing rapidly in recent years,
it is still a challenge for face reconstruction under large pose. That is
because much of the information about a face in a large pose will be
unknowable. In order to address this issue, this paper proposes a novel 3D face
reconstruction algorithm (PIFR) based on 3D Morphable Model (3DMM). After input
a single face image, it generates a frontal image by normalizing the image.
Then we set weighted sum of the 3D parameters of the two images. Our method
solves the problem of face reconstruction of a single image of a traditional
method in a large pose, works on arbitrary Pose and Expressions, greatly
improves the accuracy of reconstruction. Experiments on the challenging AFW,
LFPW and AFLW database show that our algorithm significantly improves the
accuracy of 3D face reconstruction even under extreme poses .

similar by only considering their compiled form. Advanced techniques for binary
similarity recently gained momentum as they can be applied in several fields,
such as copyright disputes, malware analysis, vulnerability detection, etc.,
and thus have an immediate practical impact. Current solutions compare
functions by first transforming their binary code in multi-dimensional vector
representations (embeddings), and then comparing vectors through simple and
efficient geometric operations. However, embeddings are usually derived from
binary code using manual feature extraction, that may fail in considering
important function characteristics, or may consider features that are not
important for the binary similarity problem. In this paper we propose SAFE, a
novel architecture for the embedding of functions based on a self-attentive
neural network. SAFE works directly on disassembled binary functions, does not
require manual feature extraction, is computationally more efficient than
existing solutions (i.e., it does not incur in the computational overhead of
building or manipulating control flow graphs), and is more general as it works
on stripped binaries and on multiple architectures. We report the results from
a quantitative and qualitative analysis that show how SAFE provides a
noticeable performance improvement with respect to previous solutions.
Furthermore, we show how clusters of our embedding vectors are closely related
to the semantic of the implemented algorithms, paving the way for further
interesting applications (e.g. semantic-based binary function search).

self-driving cars and drones), efficient 360{\deg} perception becomes more and
more important. We propose a novel self-supervised learning approach for
predicting the omnidirectional depth and camera motion from a 360{\deg} video.
In particular, starting from the SfMLearner, which is designed for cameras with
normal field-of-view, we introduce three key features to process 360{\deg}
images efficiently. Firstly, we convert each image from equirectangular
projection to cubic projection in order to avoid image distortion. In each
network layer, we use Cube Padding (CP), which pads intermediate features from
adjacent faces, to avoid image boundaries. Secondly, we propose a novel
""spherical"" photometric consistency constraint on the whole viewing sphere. In
this way, no pixel will be projected outside the image boundary which typically
happens in images with normal field-of-view. Finally, rather than naively
estimating six independent camera motions (i.e., naively applying SfM-Learner
to each face on a cube), we propose a novel camera pose consistency loss to
ensure the estimated camera motions reaching consensus. To train and evaluate
our approach, we collect a new PanoSUNCG dataset containing a large amount of
360{\deg} videos with groundtruth depth and camera motion. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art depth prediction and camera motion estimation on
PanoSUNCG with faster inference speed comparing to equirectangular. In
real-world indoor videos, our approach can also achieve qualitatively
reasonable depth prediction by acquiring model pre-trained on PanoSUNCG.

ABDE providing the ratio between fibroglandular and total breast area on a

Here we study the correlation between photometric brightness variations,
spottedness and mean temperature in V889 Her, a young solar analogue. Our data
covers 18 years of spectroscopic and 25 years of photometric observations. We
use Doppler imaging to derive temperature maps from high-resolution spectra. We
use the Continuous Period Search method to retrieve mean V-magnitudes from
photometric data. Our Doppler imaging maps show a persistent polar spot
structure varying in strength. This structure is centered slightly off the
rotational pole. The mean temperature derived from the maps shows an overall
decreasing trend, as does the photometric mean brightness, until it reaches its
minimum around 2017. The filling factor of cool spots, however, shows only a
weak tendency to anti-correlate with the decreasing mean brightness. We
interpret V889 Her to have entered into a grand maximum in its activity. The
clear relation between the mean temperature of the Doppler imaging surface maps
and the mean magnitude supports the reliability of the Doppler images. The lack
of correlation between the mean magnitude and the spottedness may indicate that
bright features in the Doppler images are real.

used for constitutive modeling in continuum mechanics, providing physical
constraints on a priori unknown constitutive functions. The well-known
M\""uller-Liu procedure is based on Liu's lemma for linear systems. While the
M\""uller-Liu algorithm works well for basic models with simple constitutive
dependencies, it cannot take into account nonlinear relationships that exist
between higher derivatives of the fields in the cases of more complex
constitutive dependencies.
  The current contribution presents a general solution set-based procedure,
which, for a model system of differential equations, respects the geometry of
the solution manifold, and yields a set of constraint equations on the unknown
constitutive functions, which are necessary and sufficient conditions for the
entropy production to stay nonnegative for any solution. Similarly to the
M\""uller-Liu procedure, the solution set approach is algorithmic, its output
being a set of constraint equations and a residual entropy inequality. The
solution set method is applicable to virtually any physical model, allows for
arbitrary initially postulated forms of the constitutive dependencies, and does
not use artificial constructs like Lagrange multipliers. A Maple implementation
makes the solution set method computationally straightforward and useful for
the constitutive modeling of complex systems.
  Several computational examples are considered, in particular, models of gas,
anisotropic fluid, and granular flow dynamics. The resulting constitutive
function forms are analyzed, and comparisons are provided. It is shown how the
solution set entropy principle can yield classification problems, leading to
several complementary sets of admissible constitutive functions; such problems
have not previously appeared in the constitutive modeling literature.

are incorporated in our 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of their winds. We
show that angular-momentum loss and mass-loss rates decrease steadily on
evolutionary timescales, although they can vary in a magnetic cycle timescale.
Stellar winds are known to emit radiation in the form of thermal bremsstrahlung
in the radio spectrum. To calculate the expected radio fluxes from these winds,
we solve the radiative transfer equation numerically from first principles. We
compute continuum spectra across the frequency range 100 MHz - 100 GHz and find
maximum radio flux densities ranging from 0.05 - 8.3 $\mu$Jy. At a frequency of
1 GHz and a normalised distance of d = 10 pc, the radio flux density follows
0.24 $(\Omega/\Omega_{\odot})^{0.9}$ (d/[10pc])$^2$ $\mu$Jy, where $\Omega$ is
the rotation rate. This means that the best candidates for stellar wind
observations in the radio regime are faster rotators within distances of 10 pc,
such as $\kappa^1$ Ceti (2.83 $\mu$Jy) and $\chi^1$ Ori (8.3 $\mu$Jy). These
flux predictions provide a guide to observing solar-type stars across the

molecules with incomplete contacts to the interface. Electrons, being the main
spin and charge carriers propagating through the interfaces involving
self-assembled molecules, interact inelastically with charged atomic ions. Such
interactions produce quantum molecular vibrations (phonons). Detailed
investigation of both conductance and conductance fluctuations in magnetic
tunnel junctions with few nm Perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) allows
to map vibrational heating at specific biases taking place in 'hot spots' where
self-assembled layers weaker contact the metallic electrodes. We follow this
effect as a function of PTCDA thickness and find the best molecular-metal order
for the lowest (3-5 monolayers) barriers. Moreover, we unveil interplay between
spin and phonons at interface showing experimentally and by modelling
spin-control over molecular vibrational heating. We find that vibrational
heating related low frequency noise essentially depends on the relative

breaking degenerate higher order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories to admit
stealth black hole solutions. Such black hole configurations correspond to
vacuum solutions of General Relativity and admit a scalar hair which does not
gravitate, revealing itself only at the perturbative level. We focus our
investigation on hairy Schwarzschild-(A)dS or pure Schwarzschild solutions,
dressed with a linear time-dependent scalar hair, and assuming a constant
kinetic term. We also discuss subclasses of this family which satisfy the
observational constraint $c_{\text{grav}}=c_{\text{light}}$, as well as the
recent constraint ensuring the absence of graviton decay. We provide at the end
concrete examples of DHOST lagrangians satisfying our conditions. This work
provides a first analysis of exact black hole solutions in shift symmetry

Additionally, we show that the gains from unsupervised transfer techniques can
be further improved by supervised transfer. The improvements are more
pronounced in low resource settings and when using only 1000 labeled in-domain

10-15x more labeled in-domain data.

of interacting proteins. Here we develop a theoretical and computational
framework that relates the biophysics of protein-protein interactions (PPIs)
within a signaling network to its information processing properties. To do so,
we generalize statistical physics-inspired models for protein binding to
account for interactions that depend on post-translational state (e.g.
phosphorylation). By combining these models with information-theoretic methods,
we find that PPIs are a key determinant of information transmission within a
signaling network, with weak interactions giving rise to ""noise"" that
diminishes information transmission. While noise can be mitigated by increasing
interaction strength, the accompanying increase in transmission comes at the
expense of a slower dynamical response. This suggests that the biophysics of
signaling protein interactions give rise to a fundamental ""speed-information""
trade-off. Surprisingly, we find that cross-talk between pathways in complex
signaling networks do not significantly alter information capacity--an
observation that may partially explain the promiscuity and ubiquity of weak
PPIs in heavily interconnected networks. We conclude by showing how our
framework can be used to design synthetic biochemical networks that maximize
information transmission, a procedure we dub ""InfoMax"" design.

KDD-99 alternatives when trained using classification models commonly found in

explore UNSW-NB15, a modern substitute to KDD-99 with greater uniformity of

an inverse linear calibration approach based on the cross-section of the

consider the case $0\leq\mu<({ p_1^2}/{ p_2})(n-2)^2/4$ , where $ p_1,p_2$ are
two positive constants which satisfy:\, $ 0< p_1\leq p(x)\leq p_2 , \forall
x\in\overline{\Omega}$. We extend the specific Carleman estimates in the paper
of Ervedoza (2008) and Vancostenoble (2011) to the equation we consider and
apply it to deduce an observability inequality for the system. By this
inequality and the classical HUM method, we obtain that we can control the
equation from any non-empty open subset as for the heat equation. Moreover, we
will study the case $\mu>p_2(n-2)^2/4$. We consider a sequence of regularized
potentials $\mu/(|x|^2+\epsilon^2),$ and prove that we cannot stabilize the
corresponding systems uniformly with respect to $\epsilon>0,$ due to the
presence of explosive modes which concentrate around the singularity.

a new framework called evolutionary system, with which a (weak) trajectory

galaxies in X-rays can be complicated by the presence of X-ray point sources,
the majority of which will be active galactic nuclei (AGN). This can be
addressed by combining observations from a high angular resolution observatory
(such as Chandra) with deeper data from a more sensitive observatory that may
not be able to resolve the AGN (like XMM). However, this approach is undermined
if the AGN varies in flux between the epochs of the observations. To address
this we measure the characteristic X-ray variability of serendipitously
detected AGN in 70 pairs of Chandra observations, separated by intervals of
between one month and thirteen years. After quality cuts, the full sample
consists of 1511 sources, although the main analysis uses a subset of 416
sources selected on the geometric mean of their flux in the pairs of
observations, which eliminates selection biases. We find a fractional
variability that increases with increasing interval between observations, from
about 0.25 for observations separated by tens of days up to about 0.45 for
observations separated by $\sim 10$ years. As a rule of thumb, given the
precise X-ray flux of a typical AGN at one epoch, its flux at a second epoch
some years earlier or later can be predicted with a precision of about $60\%$
due to its variability (ignoring any statistical noise). This is larger than
the characteristic variability of the population by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$ due
to the uncertainty on the mean flux of the AGN due to a single prior
measurement. The precision can thus be improved with multiple prior flux
measurements (reducing the $\sqrt{2}$ factor), or by reducing the interval
between observations to reduce the characteristic variability.

the rate of change of the power output is a common way to mitigate these

show that the optimal control policy can be computed using information that is
only available in hindsight. Based on this, we use imitation learning to train

a birational map which approximates the shift along the phase flow. For a
planar quadratic Hamiltonian vector field with a linear Poisson tensor and with
a quadratic Hamilton function, this map is known to be integrable and to
preserve a pencil of conics. In the paper `Three classes of quadratic vector
fields for which the Kahan discretization is the root of a generalised Manin
transformation' by P. van der Kamp et al., it was shown that the Kahan
discretization can be represented as a composition of two involutions on the
pencil of conics. In the present note, which can be considered as a comment to
that paper, we show that this result can be reversed. For a linear form
$\ell(x,y)$, let $B_1,B_2$ be any two distinct points on the line
$\ell(x,y)=-c$, and let $B_3,B_4$ be any two distinct points on the line
$\ell(x,y)=c$. Set $B_0=\tfrac{1}{2}(B_1+B_3)$ and $B_5=\tfrac{1}{2}(B_2+B_4)$;
these points lie on the line $\ell(x,y)=0$. Finally, let $B_\infty$ be the
point at infinity on this line. Let $\mathfrak E$ be the pencil of conics with
the base points $B_1,B_2,B_3,B_4$. Then the composition of the
$B_\infty$-switch and of the $B_0$-switch on the pencil $\mathfrak E$ is the
Kahan discretization of a Hamiltonian vector field
$f=\ell(x,y)\begin{pmatrix}\partial H/\partial y \\ -\partial H/\partial x

$\Phi_f:\mathbb C P^2\dashrightarrow\mathbb C P^2$ has three singular points

obtained the capacity of this SUICP(SNC) and proposed $(U+1)$-dimensional
optimal length vector linear index codes by using Vandermonde matrices.
However, for a $b$-dimensional vector linear index code, the transmitter needs
to wait for $b$ realizations of each message and hence the latency introduced
at the transmitter is proportional to $b$. For any given single unicast index
coding problem (SUICP) with the side-information graph $G$, MAIS($G$) is used
to give a lowerbound on the broadcast rate of the ICP. In this paper, we derive
MAIS($G$) of SUICP(SNC) with side-information graph $G$. We construct scalar
linear index codes for SUICP(SNC) with length $\left \lceil \frac{K}{U+1}
\right \rceil - \left \lfloor \frac{D-U}{U+1} \right \rfloor$. We derive the
minrank($G$) of SUICP(SNC) with side-information graph $G$ and show that the
constructed scalar linear index codes are of optimal length for SUICP(SNC) with
some combinations of $K,D$ and $U$. For SUICP(SNC) with arbitrary $K,D$ and
$U$, we show that the length of constructed scalar linear index codes are
atmost two index code symbols per message symbol more than the broadcast rate.
The given results for SUICP(SNC) are of practical importance due to its
relation with topological interference management problem in wireless
communication networks.

  Gust",,,,,"cs.CE stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many methodologies have been proposed to quickly identify among a very large
number of flight conditions and maneuvers (i.e., steady, quasi-steady and
unsteady loads cases) the ones which give the worst values for structural
sizing (e.g., bending moments, shear forces, torques,...). All of these methods
use both the simulation model of the aircraft under development and efficient
algorithms to find out the critical points of the flight envelope. At the
preliminary structural design phases detailed models are not available and
airframe's loads are estimated by empirical relationships or engineering
judgments. These approximations can induce load uncertainties and may lead to
expensive redesign activities through the upcoming detailed sizing process. In
the context of preliminary design phase for a weight aircraft variant without
geometric change, to overcome this likely drawback, we propose a method based
on the huge and reliable database of an initial aircraft from which the weight
variant belongs. More precisely, from the load cases of this initial database,
response surfaces are identified as functions of preliminary parameters (flight
conditions and structural parameters). Then, these response surfaces are used
to predict quickly the weight aircraft variant quantities of interest for
preliminary structural design studies. Although the proposed method can be
readily extended to any structural quantity of interest and to any flight
conditions and maneuvers, it is presented here for the prediction of the
bending moments due to discrete gust at different locations along a wing span.

particularly interesting subclass of these mechanisms is intrinsic and based on
the conversion of the incoming electromagnetic radiation into plasmons, which
resonantly enhance the photoresponse, and subsequent rectification via
hydrodynamic nonlinearities. In this Article we show that such conversion and
subsequent rectification occur well beyond the frequency regime in which
hydrodynamic theory applies. We consider the nonlinear optical response of
generic 2D electron systems and derive pseudo-Euler equations of motion for
suitable collective variables. These are solved in one- and two-dimensional

systems have long been an interest and also a big challenge for the

the agent knows the teammates' policies, it can adjust its own policy
accordingly to arrive at proper cooperations; while the challenge is that the
agents' policies are changing continuously due to they are learning
concurrently, which imposes difficulty to model the dynamic policies of
teammates accurately. In this paper, we present \emph{ATTention Multi-Agent
Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient} (ATT-MADDPG) to address this challenge.
ATT-MADDPG extends DDPG, a single-agent actor-critic RL method, with two
special designs. First, in order to model the teammates' policies, the agent
should get access to the observations and actions of teammates. ATT-MADDPG
adopts a centralized critic to collect such information. Second, to model the
teammates' policies using the collected information in an effective way,
ATT-MADDPG enhances the centralized critic with an attention mechanism. This
attention mechanism introduces a special structure to explicitly model the
dynamic joint policy of teammates, making sure that the collected information
can be processed efficiently. We evaluate ATT-MADDPG on both benchmark tasks
and the real-world packet routing tasks. Experimental results show that it not
only outperforms the state-of-the-art RL-based methods and rule-based methods

  authorship and strong modifications of the paper (errors in some frequencies)",,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Road accidents involving pedestrians are still too numerous in cities,
particularly at crosswalks. Many pedestrians crossed at the red light at zebras
increasing the risk of accidents, for them and for people following mimetically
them. Several studies tried to understand the causes of these illegal
road-crossing behaviours, showing an effect of age, gender but also culture.
This current study aims to understand causes of the uncertainty behaviour in
two different countries: France and Japan. Uncertainty behaviour during
road-crossing is here defined as a walking stop or a slowing down during a
road-crossing behaviour at the red light. Uncertainty happens when there is a
conflict between different information a pedestrians get, specifically between
private and social information. This uncertainty behaviour is followed either
by a speeding up to finish to cross the road or a giving-up. Our study showed
an uncertainty time longer in Japan compared to France. Japanese pedestrians
hesitated on a longer time when someone accompanied them. Being on the phone
did not have an effect on the uncertainty time. There are many more give-ups
than speed-ups, and this rate increases with the number of lanes. Moreover,
there is a tendency to speed up with the number of pedestrians already crossing
the road. This study confirms that pedestrians followed social information at
road-crossings and hesitate when they realised their errors, increasing their
risk of accidents. Understanding this, different solutions might be proposed to
avoid these unintentional illegal road-crossing behaviours.

  compression","6 pages, 5 figures, submit version","Physics Letters A 383, 2285 (2019)","10.1016/j.physleta.2019.04.048",,"physics.plasm-ph nucl-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We report the highest compression reached in laboratory plasmas using eight
laser beams, E$_{laser}$$\approx$12 kJ, $\tau_{laser}$=2 ns in third harmonic
on a CD$_2$ target at the ShenGuang-II Upgrade (SGII-Up) facility in Shanghai,
China. We estimate the deuterium density $\rho_D$= 2.0 $\pm$ 0.9 kg/cm$^{3}$,
and the average kinetic energy of the plasma ions less than 1 keV. The highest
reached areal density $\Lambda \rho_{D}$=4.8 $\pm$ 1.5 g/cm$^{2}$ was obtained
from the measured ratio of the sequential ternary fusion reactions
(dd$\rightarrow$t+p and t+d$\rightarrow$$\alpha$+n) and the two body reaction
fusions (dd$\rightarrow$$^3$He+n). At such high densities, sequential ternary
and also quaternary nuclear reactions become important as well (i.e. n(14.1
MeV) + $^{12}$C $\rightarrow$ n'+$^{12}$C* etc.) resulting in a shift of the
neutron (and proton) kinetic energies from their birth values. The Down Scatter
Ratio (DSR-quaternary nuclear reactions) method, i.e. the ratio of the 10-12MeV
neutrons divided by the total number of 14.1MeV neutrons produced, confirms the
high densities reported above. The estimated lifetime of the highly compressed
plasma is 52 $\pm$ 9 ps, much smaller than the lasers pulse duration.

hardware accelerators to improve speed and energy consumption. This paper
presents a new type of photonic accelerator based on coherent detection that is
scalable to large ($N \gtrsim 10^6$) networks and can be operated at high (GHz)
speeds and very low (sub-aJ) energies per multiply-and-accumulate (MAC), using
the massive spatial multiplexing enabled by standard free-space optical
components. In contrast to previous approaches, both weights and inputs are
optically encoded so that the network can be reprogrammed and trained on the
fly. Simulations of the network using models for digit- and
image-classification reveal a ""standard quantum limit"" for optical neural
networks, set by photodetector shot noise. This bound, which can be as low as
50 zJ/MAC, suggests performance below the thermodynamic (Landauer) limit for
digital irreversible computation is theoretically possible in this device. The
proposed accelerator can implement both fully-connected and convolutional
networks. We also present a scheme for back-propagation and training that can
be performed in the same hardware. This architecture will enable a new class of
ultra-low-energy processors for deep learning.
