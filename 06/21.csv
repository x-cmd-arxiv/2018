function is an average of $n$ nonconvex functions. We propose a new stochastic
gradient descent algorithm based on nested variance reduction. Compared with
conventional stochastic variance reduced gradient (SVRG) algorithm that uses
two reference points to construct a semi-stochastic gradient with diminishing
variance in each iteration, our algorithm uses $K+1$ nested reference points to
build a semi-stochastic gradient to further reduce its variance in each
iteration. For smooth nonconvex functions, the proposed algorithm converges to
an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order stationary point (i.e., $\|\nabla
F(\mathbf{x})\|_2\leq \epsilon$) within $\tilde O(n\land
\epsilon^{-2}+\epsilon^{-3}\land n^{1/2}\epsilon^{-2})$ number of stochastic
gradient evaluations. This improves the best known gradient complexity of SVRG
$O(n+n^{2/3}\epsilon^{-2})$ and that of SCSG $O(n\land
\epsilon^{-2}+\epsilon^{-10/3}\land n^{2/3}\epsilon^{-2})$. For gradient
dominated functions, our algorithm also achieves better gradient complexity
than the state-of-the-art algorithms. Thorough experimental results on
different nonconvex optimization problems back up our theory.

supernovae and the resultant nucleosynthetic yields is important for
interpreting observations of spectra and remnants. The scales of the processes
involved span orders of magnitudes, making the problem computationally
impossible to ever fully resolve in full star simulations in the present and
near future. In the lower density regions of the star, the curvature of the
detonation front will slow the detonation, affecting the production of
intermediate mass elements. We find that shock strengthening due to the density
gradient present in the outer layers of the progenitor is essential for
understanding the nucleosynthesis there, with burning extending well below the
density at which a steady-state detonation is extinct. We show that a complete
reaction network is not sufficient to obtain physical detonations at high
densities and modest resolution due to numerical mixing at the unresolved
reaction front. At low densities, below 6$\times$10$^{5}$ g cm$^{-3}$, it is
possible to achieve high enough resolution to separate the shock and the
reaction region,and the abundance structure predicted by fully resolved
quasi-steady-state calculations is obtained. For our best current benchmark
yields, we utilize a method in which the unresolved portion of Lagrangian
histories are reconstructed based on fully resolved quasi-steady-state
detonation calculations. These computations demonstrate that under-resolved
simulations agree approximately, $\sim$10\% in post-shock values of
temperature, pressure, density, and abundances, with expected detonation
structures sufficiently far from the under-resolved region, but that there is
still room for some improvement in the treatment of subgrid reactions in the
hydrodynamics to before better than 1$\%$ can be achieved at all densities.

problems, which often use generative adversarial networks, our generation task
is conditioned on both appearance and geometry and thus is significantly less

sufficient. We demonstrate that our approach can learn object landmarks from

results across various applications, the effect of \emph{noisy training
annotations} is rarely studied in a systematic manner. In Medical Image
Analysis, most reports addressing this question concentrate on studying
segmentation performance of deep learning classifiers. The absence of
continuous ground truth annotations in these studies limits the value of
conclusions for applications, where regression is the primary method of choice.
In the application of surgical instrument pose estimation, where precision has
a direct clinical impact on patient outcome, studying the effect of \emph{noisy
annotations} on deep learning pose estimation techniques is of supreme
importance. Real x-ray images are inadequate for this evaluation due to the
unavailability of ground truth annotations. We circumvent this problem by
generating synthetic radiographs, where the ground truth pose is known and
therefore the pose estimation error made by the medical-expert can be estimated
from experiments. Furthermore, this study shows the property of deep neural
networks to learn dominant signals from noisy annotations with sufficient data

the framework of stochastic thermodynamics. In such systems, fluctuations,
which are not negligible, follow universal relations such as the fluctuation
theorem. More recently, it has been found that, for nonequilibrium stationary
states, the full spectrum of fluctuations of any thermodynamic current is
bounded by the average rate of entropy production and the average current.
However, this bound does not apply to periodically driven systems, such as heat
engines driven by periodic variation of the temperature and artificial
molecular pumps driven by an external protocol. We obtain a universal bound on
current fluctuations for periodically driven systems. This bound is a
generalization of the known bound for stationary states. In general, the
average rate that bounds fluctuations in periodically driven systems is
different from the rate of entropy production. We also obtain a local bound on
fluctuations that leads to a trade-off relation between speed and precision in
periodically driven systems, which constitutes a generalization to periodically
driven systems of the so called thermodynamic uncertainty relation. From a
technical perspective, our results are obtained with the use of a recently
developed theory for 2.5 large deviations for Markov jump processes with
time-periodic transition rates.

  For a general offspring distribution, there is a surprisingly rich variety of
behaviour: the (unrescaled) value of the game may converge to a constant, or to
a discrete limit with several atoms, or to a continuous distribution. We also
give distributional limits under suitable rescalings in various cases.
  We also address questions of endogeny. Suppose the game is played on a tree
with many levels, so that the terminal values are far from the root. To be
confident of playing a good first move, do we need to see the whole tree and
its terminal values, or can we play close to optimally by inspecting just the
first few levels of the tree? The answers again depend in an interesting way on
the offspring distribution.

two-dimensional (2D) materials. For example, the liquid phase exfoliation of
layered materials requires a solvent to prevent the resulting monolayers from
re-aggregating, while solutions of functional atoms and molecules are routinely
used to modify the properties of the layers. It is generally assumed that these
solvents do not interact strongly with the layer and so their effects can be
neglected. Yet experimental evidence has suggested that explicit atomic-scale
interactions between the solvent and layered material may play a crucial role
in exfoliation and cause unintended electronic changes in the layer. Little is
known about the precise nature of the interaction between the solvent molecules
and the 2D layer. Here, we use density functional theory calculations to
determine the adsorption configuration and binding energy of a variety of
common solvent molecules, both polar and non-polar, on two of the most popular
2D materials, namely graphene and MoS$_2$. We show that these molecules are
physisorbed on the surface with negligible charge transferred between them. We
find that the adsorption strength of the different molecules is independent of
the polar nature of the solvent. However, we show the molecules induce a
significant charge rearrangement at the interface after adsorption as a result
of polar bonds in the molecule.

interaction with deformable objects has notably lagged behind. Due to the large

bypassing the need for explicit modelling and instead learning the control in
an end-to-end manner serves as a better approach? Despite the growing interest
in the use of end-to-end robot learning approaches, only a small amount of work
has focused on their applicability to deformable object manipulation. Moreover,
due to the large amount of data needed to learn these end-to-end solutions, an
emerging trend is to learn control policies in simulation and then transfer
them over to the real world. To-date, no work has explored whether it is
possible to learn and transfer deformable object policies. We believe that if
sim-to-real methods are to be employed further, then it should be possible to
learn to interact with a wide variety of objects, and not only rigid objects.
In this work, we use a combination of state-of-the-art deep reinforcement
learning algorithms to solve the problem of manipulating deformable objects

functionals on representations $\Pi$ of $GL_2$ of a $p$-adic field $F$, where
$T$ is a non-split torus. Of particular interest is the case when both the
representations are ramified; we completely solve this problem for principal
series and Steinberg representations of $GL_2$, as well as for depth zero
supercuspidals over $\mathbf{Q}_p$. A key ingredient is a theorem of Casselman
and Silberger, which allows us to quickly reduce almost all cases to that of
the principal series, which can be analyzed directly. Our method shows that the
only genuinely difficult cases are the characters of $T$ which occur in the
primitive part (or ""type"") of $\Pi$ when $\Pi$ is supercuspidal. The method to
handle the depth zero case is based on modular representation theory, motivated
by considerations from Deligne-Lusztig theory and the de Rham cohomology of
Deligne-Lusztig-Drinfeld curves. The proof also reveals some interesting
features related to the Langlands correspondence in characteristic $p$. We show
in particular that the test vector problem has an obstruction in characteristic
$p$ beyond the root number criterion of Waldspurger and Tunnell, and exhibits
an unexpected dichotomy related to the weights in Serre's conjecture and the
signs of standard Gauss sums.

For videos https://goo.gl/EQerZV",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose RUDDER, a novel reinforcement learning approach for delayed
rewards in finite Markov decision processes (MDPs). In MDPs the Q-values are
equal to the expected immediate reward plus the expected future rewards. The
latter are related to bias problems in temporal difference (TD) learning and to
high variance problems in Monte Carlo (MC) learning. Both problems are even
more severe when rewards are delayed. RUDDER aims at making the expected future
rewards zero, which simplifies Q-value estimation to computing the mean of the
immediate reward. We propose the following two new concepts to push the
expected future rewards toward zero. (i) Reward redistribution that leads to
return-equivalent decision processes with the same optimal policies and, when
optimal, zero expected future rewards. (ii) Return decomposition via
contribution analysis which transforms the reinforcement learning task into a
regression task at which deep learning excels. On artificial tasks with delayed
rewards, RUDDER is significantly faster than MC and exponentially faster than
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), TD({\lambda}), and reward shaping approaches.
At Atari games, RUDDER on top of a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) baseline
improves the scores, which is most prominent at games with delayed rewards.

spontaneous emission and dephasing times, $T_1$ and $T_2$. As opposed to
standard quantum error correction methods, which have an overhead in the number
of qubits (many physical qubits must be added for each logical qubit) our
method has only an overhead in number of evaluations, allowing the overhead to,
in principle, be hidden via parallelization. We show that the effective
spontaneous emission, $T_1$, and dephasing, $T_2$, times can be increased using
this method in both simulation and experiments on an actual quantum computer.
We also show how to correct more complicated entangled states and how Ramsey

regime, correlated insulating states and superconductivity have been
experimentally observed. A microscopic description of these phenomena requires
an understanding of universal aspects of the band structure, which we discuss

conservation, which are excellent symmetries in the limit of small twist angles

arrangements under moderate to heavy occlusion, directly from monocular video.
While the problem remains a subject of active research, concurrent advances
have been made in the context of human pose reconstruction from monocular
video, including image-space feature point detection and 3D pose recovery.
These methods, however, start to fail under moderate to heavy occlusion as the
problem becomes severely under-constrained. We approach the problems
differently. We observe that people interact similarly in similar scenes.
Hence, we exploit the correlation between scene object arrangement and motions
performed in that scene in both directions: first, typical motions performed
when interacting with objects inform us about possible object arrangements; and
second, object arrangements, in turn, constrain the possible motions.
  We present iMapper, a data-driven method that focuses on identifying
human-object interactions, and jointly reasons about objects and human movement
over space-time to recover both a plausible scene arrangement and consistent
human interactions. We first introduce the notion of characteristic
interactions as regions in space-time when an informative human-object
interaction happens. This is followed by a novel occlusion-aware matching
procedure that searches and aligns such characteristic snapshots from an
interaction database to best explain the input monocular video. Through
extensive evaluations, both quantitative and qualitative, we demonstrate that
iMapper significantly improves performance over both dedicated state-of-the-art

simulations to investigate the effects of shocks and turbulence on energy
transport into hot Jupiter atmospheres, under a variety of shear gradients. We
focus on a local atmospheric region to accurately follow the small-scale
structures of turbulence and shocks. We find that the effects of turbulence
above and below a shear layer are different in scale and magnitude: below the
shear layer, the effects of turbulence on the vertical energy transfer are
local, generally $\lesssim2~\times(\text{scale height})$. However, turbulence
can have a spatially and thermally-large influence on almost the entire region
above the shear layer. We also find that shock formation is local and
transient. Once the atmosphere becomes steady, the time-averaged heat energy
flux at $P\sim 1$ bar is insignificant, on the order of 0.001\% of the incoming
stellar flux with a shear motion at $P\sim 1$ mbar, and 0.1\% with a deeper
shear layer at $P\sim 100$ mbar. Accordingly, the diffusion coefficient is
higher for the deeper shear layer. Therefore, our results suggest that
turbulence near less dense regions ($P\sim 1$ mbar) does not cause a
sufficiently deep and large penetration of thermal energy to account for radius
inflation in hot Jupiters, regardless of how violent the turbulence is.
However, as the shear layer gets deeper, heat energy transfer becomes more
effective throughout the atmosphere (upwards and downwards) due to a larger
kinetic energy budget. Therefore, it is more important how deep turbulence
occurs in the atmosphere, than how unstable the atmosphere is for effective
energy transfer.

that they are consistent with a population that was accreted at early times and
thus potentially quenched via environmental processes. To study the potential
role of environment in suppressing star formation on the smallest scales, we
utilize the Exploring the Local Volume in Simulations (ELVIS) suite of $N$-body
simulations to constrain the distribution of infall times for low-mass subhalos
likely to host the ultra-faint population. For the ultra-faint satellites of
the Milky Way with star-formation histories inferred from
$Hubble~Space~Telescope$ imaging, we find that environment is highly unlikely
to play a dominant role in quenching their star formation. Even when including
the potential effects of pre-processing, there is a $\lesssim 0.1\%$

Instead, we argue for a mass floor in the effectiveness of satellite quenching
at roughly $M_{\star} \sim 10^{5}~M_{\odot}$, below which star formation in
surviving galaxies is globally suppressed by reionization. We predict a large
population of quenched ultra-faint dwarfs in the Local Field ($1 <

been extensively probed. Such obliquities may reveal clues about hot Jupiter
dynamical histories. Common explanations for generating obliquities include
high-eccentricity migration and primordial disk misalignment. This paper
investigates another mechanism for producing stellar spin-orbit misalignments
in systems hosting a close-in planet with an external, modestly inclined
companion. Spin-orbit misalignment may be excited due to a secular resonance,
occurring when the precession rate of the stellar spin axis (driven by the
inner planet) becomes comparable to the nodal precession rate of the inner
planet (driven by the companion). Due to the spin-down of the host star via
magnetic braking, this resonance may be achieved during the star's
main-sequence lifetime for a wide range of planet masses and orbital
architectures. Obliquity excitation is accompanied by a decrease in mutual
inclination between the inner planet and perturber, and can thus erase high
inclinations. For hot Jupiters, the stellar spin axis is strongly coupled to
the orbital axis, and obliquity excitation by a giant planet companion requires
a strong perturber, usually located within 1-2 AU. For warm Jupiters, the spin
and orbital axes are more weakly coupled, and the resonance may be achieved for
distant giant planet perturbers (at several to tens of AU). Since warm Jupiters
have a high occurrence rate of distant planetary companions with appropriate
properties for resonant obliquity excitation, stellar obliquities in warm
Jupiter systems may be common, particularly for warm Jupiters orbiting cool
stars that have undergone significant spin-down.

the angular momenta of stars orbiting around a central supermassive black hole
due to the fluctuating gravitational field of the stellar cluster. Other
spherical stellar systems, such as globular clusters, exhibit a restricted form
of this effect where enhanced relaxation rate only occurs in the directions of
the angular momentum vectors, but not in their magnitudes; this is called
vector resonant relaxation (VRR). To explore this effect, we performed a large
set of direct N-body simulations, with up to 512k particles and ~500 dynamical
times. Contrasting our simulations with Spitzer-style Monte Carlo simulations,
that by design only exhibit 2-body relaxation, we show that the temporal
behavior of the angular momentum vectors in $N$-body simulations cannot be
explained by 2-body relaxation alone. VRR operates efficiently in globular
clusters with $N>10^4$. The fact that VRR operates in globular clusters may
open way to use powerful tools in statistical physics for their description. In
particular, since the distribution of orbital planes relaxes much more rapidly
than the distribution of the magnitude of angular momentum and the radial
action, the relaxation process reaches an internal statistical equilibrium in
the corresponding part of phase space while the whole cluster is generally out
of equilibrium, in a state of quenched disorder. We point out the need to
include effects of VRR in Monte Carlo simulations of globular clusters.

two different approaches have been taken in the literature to map the

further constraining the mass of intermediate-separation companions such as GJ

Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter with a light boson mass of $m_\mathrm{B}
\simeq 10^{-22} \, \mathrm{eV}$ over standard cold dark matter. We emphasize
that measuring the magnification bias requires no correction for multiply
lensed images (with typically three or more images per source), whereas
directly reconstructing the luminosity function will lead to an overestimate
unless such images can be exhaustively matched up, especially at the faint end
that is accessible only in the strongly lensed regions. In addition, we
detected a distinctive downward transition in galaxy number density at $z
\gtrsim 8$, which may be linked to the relatively late reionization reported by
Planck. Our results suggests that JWST will likely peer into an ""abyss"" with
essentially no galaxies detected in deep NIR imaging at $z > 10$.

parasitic source of dissipation for charge transport, we propose to use mobile
vortices as topologically-stable information carriers for spin transport. To
this end, we start by constructing a phenomenological theory for the
interconversion between spin and vorticity, a topological charge carried by
vortices, at the interface between a magnetic insulator and a superconductor,
by invoking the interfacial spin Hall effect therein. We then show that a
vortex liquid in superconductors can serve as a spin-transport channel between
two magnetic insulators by encoding spin information in the vorticity. The
vortex-mediated nonlocal signal between the two magnetic insulators is shown to
decay algebraically as a function of their separation, contrasting with the
exponential decay of the quasiparticle-mediated spin transport. We envision
that hydrodynamics of topological excitations, such as vortices in
superconductors and domain walls in magnets, may serve as a universal framework
to discuss long-range transport properties of ordered materials.

allowed the identification of new samples of stars with extreme velocities.
Discrimination among the possible origins of these stars is facilitated by
chemical abundance information. We here report the results from our
high-resolution spectroscopic followup, using the Apache Point Observatory, of
five late-type `hypervelocity' star candidates, characterised by total Galactic
rest-frame velocities between 500-600 km/s and estimated to have a probability
larger than 50% to be unbound from the Milky Way. Our new results confirm the
Gaia DR2 radial velocities to within 1 km/s. We derived stellar atmospheric
parameters and chemical abundances for several species including
$\alpha$-elements (Mg, Ti, Si, Ca), Fe-peak elements (Fe, Ni, Co, Cr, Mn),
neutron-capture elements (Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Nd, Eu) and odd-Z elements (Na,
Al, K, V, Cu, Sc). We find that all stars observed are metal-poor giants with
-2 $\leq$ [Fe/H] $\leq$ -1 dex and are chemically indistinguishable from
typical halo stars. Our results are supported by the chemical properties of
four additional stars with extreme space motions which were observed by
existing spectroscopic surveys. We conclude that these stars are simply the
high-velocity tail of the stellar halo and effectively rule out more exotic
origins such as from the Galactic centre or the Large Magellanic Cloud.

fragmentation is the mechanism responsible for their formation, we expect their
stellar mass function to follow a power-law of slope close to $-2$. We test
this hypothesis performing the first analysis of the stellar mass function of
clumps hosted in galaxies at $z\sim 1-3.5$. The clump sample is gathered from
the literature with similar detection thresholds and stellar masses determined
in a homogeneous way. To overcome the small number statistics per galaxy (each
galaxy hosts up to a few tens of clumps only), we combine all high-redshift
clumps. The resulting clump mass function follows a power-law of slope $\sim
-1.7$ and flattens at masses below $2\times 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$. By means of
randomly sampled clump populations, drawn out of a power-law mass function of
slope $-2$, we test the effect of combining small clump populations, detection
limits of the surveys, and blending on the mass function. Our numerical
exercise reproduces all the features observed in the real clump mass function
confirming that it is consistent with a power-law of slope $\simeq -2$. This
result supports the high-redshift clump formation through fragmentation in a

fault-tolerant quantum computer. In addition, the physical resources required
to implement gates must scale efficiently with system size. A longstanding goal
of the superconducting qubit community is the tight integration of a
superconducting quantum circuit with a proximal classical cryogenic control
system. Here we implement coherent control of a superconducting transmon qubit
using a Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) pulse driver cofabricated on the qubit chip.
The pulse driver delivers trains of quantized flux pulses to the qubit through
a weak capacitive coupling; coherent rotations of the qubit state are realized
when the pulse-to-pulse timing is matched to a multiple of the qubit
oscillation period. We measure the fidelity of SFQ-based gates to be ~95% using
interleaved randomized benchmarking. Gate fidelities are limited by
quasiparticle generation in the dissipative SFQ driver. We characterize the
dissipative and dispersive contributions of the quasiparticle admittance and
discuss mitigation strategies to suppress quasiparticle poisoning. These
results open the door to integration of large-scale superconducting qubit
arrays with SFQ control elements for low-latency feedback and stabilization.

seven payloads in ADITYA-L1 mission scheduled to be launched around 2020. One
of the primary objectives of the VELC is to study the dynamics of coronal mass
ejections (CMEs) in the inner corona. This will be accomplished by taking high
resolution ($\approx$ 2.51 arcsec pixel$^{-1}$) images of corona from 1.05
R$_{\odot}$ -- 3 R$_{\odot}$ at high cadence of 1 s in 10 \AA\ passband
centered at 5000 \AA. Due to limited telemetry at Lagrangian 1 position we plan
to implement an onboard automated CME detection algorithm. The detection
algorithm is based on the intensity thresholding followed by the area
thresholding in successive difference images spatially re-binned to improve
signal to noise ratio. We present the results of the application of this
algorithm on the data from existing space- and ground-based coronagraph. Since,
no existing space-based coronagraph has FOV similar to VELC, we have created
synthetic coronal images for VELC FOV after including photon noise and injected
different type of CMEs. The performance of CME detection algorithm is tested on
these images. We found that for VELC images, the telemetry can be reduced by a
factor of 85\% or more keeping CME detection rate of 70\% or above at the same
time. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this algorithm.
The application of such onboard algorithm in future will enable us to take
higher resolution images with improved cadence from space and also reduce the
load on limited telemetry at the same time. This will help in better
understanding of CMEs by studying their characteristics with improved spatial
and temporal resolutions.

Markov models for point processes and exponential random graph models for

developed for these models, each method suffers from computational issues that
makes it computationally burdensome or even infeasible for many problems. We
propose a novel algorithm that provides computational gains over existing
methods by replacing Monte Carlo approximations to the normalising function
with a Gaussian process-based approximation. We provide theoretical
justification for this method. We also develop a closely related algorithm that
is applicable more broadly to any likelihood function that is expensive to

challenging simulated and real data examples, including an exponential random
graph model, a Markov point process, and a model for infectious disease

over existing methods, and has the potential for greater gains for more
challenging problems. For a random graph model example, we show how this gain
in efficiency allows us to carry out accurate Bayesian inference when other
algorithms are computationally impractical.

to 60\,nm rms wave-front error improvement for the European Extremely Large

is still beyond what a real-time system can accommodate to keep up with the

elastocaloric effect, driven by uniaxial stress; barocaloric effect, driven by

at high excitation ($E_{\rm u}$ between 163 K and 335 K) have been imaged in
the inner $\sim$ 70 au region. The local thermal equilibrium analysis of the
CH$_3$CHO emission leads to a temperature of 78$\pm$14 K and a column density
of 7.6$\pm$3.2 $\times$ 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$, which, when $N_{\rm H_2}$ of
10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$ is assumed, leads to an abundance of $X_{\rm CH_3CHO}$
$\simeq$ 8 $\times$ 10$^{-9}$. The large velocity gradient analysis of the HDO
emission also places severe constraints on the volume density, n$_{\rm H_2}$
$\geq$ 10$^8$ cm$^{-3}$. The line profiles are 5--7 km s$^{-1}$ wide, and
CH$_3$CHO and HDO both show a $\pm$ 2 km s$^{-1}$ velocity gradient over a size
of $\sim$ 70 au (blue-shifted emission towards the north-west and red-shifted
emission towards the south-east) along the disc equatorial plane, in agreement
with what was found so far using other molecular tracers. The kinematics of
CH$_3$CHO and HDO are consistent with the occurrence of a centrifugal barrier,
that is, the infalling envelope-rotating disc ring, which is chemically
enriched through low-velocity accretion shocks. The emission radius is $\sim$
60 au, in good agreement with what was found before for another interstellar
complex organic molecule such as NH$_2$CHO. We support a vertical structure for
the centrifugal barrier, suggesting the occurrence of two outflowing,
expanding, and rotating rings above and below (of about 40-45 au) the optically
thick equatorial disc plane. It is tempting to speculate that these rings could
probe the basis of a wind launched from this region.

The
Hubbard term is han- dled with strong-coupling perturbation theory which
encodes the Mott transition physics into a rich dynamical structure of a local
self-energy. The local nature of self-energy allows us to combine it with
kernel polynomial method and transfer matrix methods. The locality of
self-energy combined with the analytic nature of the strong- coupling
perturbation theory enables us to study lattices with millions of sites. The
transfer matrix method in the ribbon geometry is essentially free from finite
size errors and allows us to perform a careful finite size scaling of the width
of the ribbon. This finite size scaling enables us to rule out the possibility
of metallic phase in between the Mott and Anderson insulating phases. We
therefore find a direct transition between Anderson and Mott insulators when
the disorder strength W is comparable to the Hubbard interaction U . For a
fixed disorder W , we obtain an interaction dependent nonmonotonic behavior of
the localization length which reflects interac- tion induced enhancement of the
localization length for weak and intermediate interaction strengths. Eventually
at strong interactions U, the Mott localization takes over and the localization
length becomes comparable to the lattice scale. This is reminiscent of the
holographic determination of the Mott state where the system at IR recognizes
its UV lattice scale.

of low metallicity on this relationship is crucial for interpreting
observations of high redshift galaxies, which have lower metallicities than
galaxies today. However, it remains relatively unexplored because dense
molecular gas tracers like HCN and HCO+ are faint in low metallicity systems.
We present Green Bank Telescope observations of HCN(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) on giant
molecular cloud (34pc) scales in the nearby low metallicity ($12+\log({\rm
O/H})=8.2$) starburst IC 10 and compare them to those in other galaxies. We
detect HCN and HCO+ in one and three of five pointings, respectively. The
$I_{\rm HCN}/I_{\rm HCO+}$ values are within the range seen in other galaxies,
but are most similar to those seen in other low metallicity sources and in
starbursts. The detections follow the fiducial $L_{\rm IR}$-$L_{\rm HCN}$ and
$L_{\rm IR}$-$L_{\rm HCO+}$ relationships. These trends suggest that HCN and
HCO+ can be used to trace dense molecular gas at metallicities of 1/4
$Z_\odot$, to first order. The dense gas fraction is similar to that in spiral
galaxies, but lower than that in U/LIRGs. The dense molecular gas star
formation efficiency, however, is on the upper end of those in normal galaxies
and consistent with those in U/LIRGs. These results suggest that the CO and
HCN/HCO+ emission occupy the same relative volumes as at higher metallicity,
but that the entire emitting structure is reduced in size. Dense gas mass
estimates for high redshift galaxies may need to be corrected for this effect.

subsequently relaxed to second-order cone constraints. To restore feasibility
of the original non-convex constraints, a penalty term is appended to the
objective of the relaxed OWF. The modified problem can be solved as a
mixed-integer second-order cone program, which is analytically shown to yield
WDS-feasible minimizers under certain sufficient conditions. Under these

concentration less than 0.5, which decreases with increasing particle size

act as entanglement witness. However, there are doubts that today's NMR signals
can contain quantum correlations in general, and specifically in the brain

(ZQC) whereby we minimised the classical signals to circumvent the NMR
detection limits for quantum correlation. For short repetitive periods, we
found evoked signals in most parts of the brain, whereby the temporal
appearance resembled heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs). We found that those
signals had no correlates with any classical NMR contrast. Similar to HEPs, the
evoked signal depended on conscious awareness. Consciousness-related or
electrophysiological signals are unknown in NMR. Remarkably, these signals only
appeared if the local properties of the magnetisation were reduced. Our
findings suggest that we may have witnessed entanglement mediated by
consciousness-related brain functions. Those brain functions must then operate
non-classically, which would mean that consciousness is non-classical.

that this is because audio data is relatively low-dimensional. We therefore
introduce two new terms to the original Grammian loss: an autocorrelation term
that preserves rhythm, and a diversity term that encourages the optimization
procedure to synthesize unique textures. We quantitatively study the impact of
our design choices on the quality of the synthesized audio by introducing an
audio analogue to the Inception loss which we term the VGGish loss. We show
that there is a trade-off between the diversity and quality of the synthesized
audio using this technique. We additionally perform a number of experiments to
qualitatively study how these design choices impact the quality of the
synthesized audio. Finally we describe the implications of these results for
the problem of audio style transfer.

controls the risk of the minority group at each time step, in the spirit of

transition. In this work we present a proposed reversible logic, including gate
simulations and schematics under the name of Reversible Fluxon Logic (RFL). In
the widest sense it is related to SFQ-logic, however it relies on (some
approximately) reversible gate dynamics and promises higher efficiency than
conventional SFQ which is logically irreversible. Our gates use fluxons, a type
of SFQ which has topological-particle characteristics in an undamped Long
Josephson junction (LJJ). The collective dynamics of the component Josephson
junctions (JJs) enable ballistic fluxon motion within LJJs as well as good
energy preservation of the fluxon for JJ-circuit gates. For state changes, the
gates induce switching of fluxon polarity during resonant scattering at an
interface between different LJJs. Related to the ballistic nature of fluxons in
LJJ, the gates are powered, almost ideally, only by data fluxon momentum in
stark contrast to conventionally damped logic gates which are powered
continuously with a bias. At first the fundamental Identity and NOT gates are
introduced. Then 2-bit gates are discussed, including the IDSN gate which
actually allows low fluxon-number inputs for more than 4 input states. A
digital CNOT, an important milestone for 2-bit reversible superconducting
gates, is planned as a central result. It uses a store and launch gate to stop
and then later route a fluxon. This use of the store and launch gate allows a
clocked CNOT gate and synchronization within. The digital CNOT gate could
enable high efficiency relative to conventional irreversible gates and shows
the utility of the IDSN as a reversible gate primitive.

with age, but it is widely debated in the literature whether there is a smooth
decline or if there is an early sharp drop until 1-2 Gyr followed by a
relatively inactive constant phase. We revisited the activity-age relation
using time-series observations of a large sample of solar twins whose precise
isochronal ages and other important physical parameters have been determined.
We measured the Ca II H and K activity indices using 9000 HARPS spectra of 82
solar twins. We measured an average solar activity of $S_{\rm MW}$ = 0.1712
$\pm$ 0.0017 during solar magnetic cycles 23$-$24 covered by HARPS observations
and we also inferred an average of $S_{\rm MW}$ = 0.1694 $\pm$ 0.0025 for
cycles 10$-$24, anchored on a S index vs. sunspot number correlation. Also, a
simple relation between the average and dispersion of the activity levels of
solar twins was found. This enabled us to predict the stellar variability
effects on the age-activity diagram and, consequently, estimate the
chromospheric age uncertainties due to the same phenomena. The age-activity
relation is still statistically significant up to ages around 6$-$7 Gyr, in
agreement with previous works using open clusters and field stars with precise
ages. Our research confirms that Ca II H \& K lines remain a useful
chromospheric evolution tracer until stars reach ages of at least 6$-$7 Gyr. We
found an evidence that, for the most homogeneous set of old stars, the
chromospheric activity indices seem to continue decreasing after the solar age
towards the end of the main-sequence. Our results indicate that a significant
part of the scatter observed in the age-activity relation of solar twins can be
attributed to stellar cycle modulations effects. The Sun seems to have a normal
activity level and variability for its age.

supports advance reservations (AR). In this system, strategic customers must
decide whether to reserve a server in advance (thereby gaining higher priority)
or avoid AR. Reserving a server in advance bears a cost. In this paper, we
conduct a game-theoretic analysis of this system, characterizing the
equilibrium strategies. Specifically, we show that the game has two types of
equilibria. In one type, none of the customers makes reservation. In the other
type, only customers that realize early enough that they will need service make
reservations. We show that the types and number of equilibria depend on the
parameters of the queue and on the reservation cost. Specifically, we prove
that the equilibrium is unique if the server utilization is below 1/2.
Otherwise, there may be multiple equilibria depending on the reservation cost.
Next, we assume that the reservation cost is a fee set by the provider. In that
case, we show that the revenue maximizing fee leads to a unique equilibrium if
the utilization is below 2/3, but multiple equilibria if the utilization
exceeds 2/3. Finally, we study a dynamic version of the game, where users learn
and adapt their strategies based on observations of past actions or strategies
of other users. Depending on the type of learning (i.e., action learning vs.\
strategy learning), we show that the game converges to an equilibrium in some

store the most popular files (MPFs), while the remaining is used to cache the
disjoint subfiles (DSFs) of the less popular files in different SBSs as a means
to enhance transmission secrecy and content diversity. We then introduce two

orthogonal transmission (OT), to deliver the MPFs and DSFs, respectively. We
derive analytical expressions for the SCDP in each transmission scheme,
considering both non-colluding and colluding eavesdropping scenarios. Based on
the obtained analytical results, we jointly design the optimal transmission

Various insights into the optimal transmission and caching designs are further

classifies the origin of the gradient tensor, and the main network serves as an
adversary to the auxiliary network in addition to performing standard
task-based training. We demonstrate gradient adversarial training for three
different scenarios: (1) as a defense to adversarial examples we classify

sensitive to the priors. Rather than attempt to infer the true $\lambda$
posterior, we here compute the relative change to $\lambda$ when new
experimental/observational evidence is introduced. By simulating posterior
distributions and resulting entropic information gains, we compare three
experimental pressures on $\lambda$: 1) evidence for an earlier start to life;
$t_{\mathrm{obs}}$; 2) constraints on spontaneous abiogenesis from the lab; and
3) an exoplanet survey for biosignatures. First, we find that experiments 1 and
2 can only yield lower limits on $\lambda$, unlike 3. Second, evidence for an
earlier start to life can yield negligible information on $\lambda$ if
$t_{\mathrm{obs}} \ll \lambda_{\mathrm{max}}^{-1}$. Vice versa, experiment 2 is
uninformative when $\lambda_{\mathrm{max}} \gg t_{\mathrm{obs}}^{-1}$. Whilst
experiment 3 appears the most direct means of measuring $\lambda$, we highlight
that early starts inform us of the conditions of abiogenesis, and that lab
experiments could succeed in building new life. Together then, the three
experiments are complimentary and we encourage activity in all to solve this
grand challenge.

ferromagnets is typically killed by the exchange interaction, which destroys
the spin-singlet pairs. Under certain circumstances, however, superconductivity
survives this interaction by adopting the pairing behavior of spin triplets.
The necessary conditions for the emergence of triplet pairs are
well-understood, owing to significant developments in theoretical frameworks
and experiments. The long-term challenges to inducing superconductivity in
magnetic semiconductors, however, involve difficulties in observing the finite
supercurrent, even though the generation of superconductivity in host materials
has been well-established and extensively examined. Here, we show the first
evidence of proximity-induced superconductivity in a ferromagnetic
semiconductor (In, Fe)As. The supercurrent reached a distance scale of $\sim
1~\mu$m, which is comparable to the proximity range in two-dimensional
electrons at surfaces of pure InAs. Given the long range of its proximity
effects and its response to magnetic fields, we conclude that spin-triplet
pairing is dominant in proximity superconductivity. Therefore, this progress in
ferromagnetic semiconductors is a breakthrough in semiconductor physics
involving unconventional superconducting pairing.

Support functions of these convex bodies arise by an integral transform of

origin symmetric convex bodies; and the cosine transform is injective. We show
that these two properties are equivalent for general $K$.
  For $K$ being a generalised zonoid, we determine conditions that ensure the

information"", which reflect the amount of statistical correlation between
systems. In contrast, the concept of ""semantic information"" refers to those
correlations which carry significance or ""meaning"" for a given system. Semantic
information plays an important role in many fields, including biology,
cognitive science, and philosophy, and there has been a long-standing interest
in formulating a broadly applicable and formal theory of semantic information.
In this paper we introduce such a theory. We define semantic information as the
syntactic information that a physical system has about its environment which is
causally necessary for the system to maintain its own existence. ""Causal
necessity"" is defined in terms of counter-factual interventions which scramble
correlations between the system and its environment, while ""maintaining
existence"" is defined in terms of the system's ability to keep itself in a low
entropy state. We also use recent results in nonequilibrium statistical physics
to analyze semantic information from a thermodynamic point of view. Our
framework is grounded in the intrinsic dynamics of a system coupled to an
environment, and is applicable to any physical system, living or otherwise. It
leads to formal definitions of several concepts that have been intuitively
understood to be related to semantic information, including ""value of
information"", ""semantic content"", and ""agency"".

developed the methodology to derive these counts directly from the IPS
observables, while taking into account changes in sensitivity across the survey
area. The counts of sources with compact structure follow the behaviour of the
dominant source population above $\sim$3 Jy but below this they show Euclidean
behaviour. We compare our counts to those predicted by simulations and find a
good agreement for our counts of sources with compact structure, but
significant disagreement for point source counts. Using low radio frequency
SEDs from the GLEAM survey, we classify point sources as Compact Steep-Spectrum
(CSS), flat spectrum, or peaked. If we consider the CSS sources to be the more
evolved counterparts of the peaked sources, the two categories combined
comprise approximately 80% of the point source population. We calculate
densities of potential calibrators brighter than 0.4 Jy at low frequencies and
find 0.2 sources per square degrees for point sources, rising to 0.7 sources
per square degree if sources with more complex arcsecond structure are
included. We extrapolate to estimate 4.6 sources per square degrees at 0.04 Jy.
We find that a peaked spectrum is an excellent predictor for compactness at low
frequencies, increasing the number of good calibrators by a factor of three
compared to the usual flat spectrum criterion.

induce a metal-semimetal-semiconductor phase transition, during which several
novel types of 2D fermions emerge, including the anisotropic Dirac fermions
around 12 tilted Dirac points in the metallic phase, the $2$D double Weyl

quadratically at a single Fermi point, and the 2D pseudospin-1 fermions at the
critical point of the semimetal-semiconductor phase transition where three

curvesand spectra of the explosions of blue supergiant progenitors from binary
mergers. We study SN 1987A and two other peculiar Type IIP supernovae: SN 1998A
and SN 2006V. The progenitor models were produced using the stellar evolution
code Keplerand then exploded using the 1D radiation hydrodynamic code Crab. The
explosions of binary merger models exhibit an overall better fit to the light
curve of SN 1987A than previous single star models, because of their lower
helium-core masses, larger envelope masses, and smaller radii. The merger model
that best matches the observational constraints of the progenitor of SN 1987A
and the light curve is a model with a radius of 37 solar radii, an ejecta mass
of 20.6 solar masses, an explosion energy of 1.7 Bethe, a nickel mass of 0.073
solar masses, and a nickel mixing velocity of 3,000 km/s. This model also works
for SN 1998A and is comparable with earlier estimates from semi-analytic
models. In the case of SN 2006V, however, a model with a radius of 150 solar
radii and ejecta mass of 19.1 solar masses matches the light curve. These
parameters are significantly higher than predictions from semi-analytic models
for the progenitor of this supernova.

the QCD factorization to study the $B\to\pi K$ puzzle. The parameterization
introduces twelve parameters, the weak angle $\gamma$ and the other eleven
hadronic parameters. These hadronic parameters are calculated by the QCD
factorization (QCDF). The calculational accuracy of the QCDF is improved by
including the twist-3 three parton tree and one loop corrections. Three
additional nonperturbative strong phases from the gluonic penguin, color
suppressed, and color favored tree diagrams are required to account for the
direct CP asymmetries. The weak angle, three nonperturbative strong phases, and
four scale variables are assumed as fitting parameters. These eight parameters
are determined by a least squares fit to the eight measurements. The fit shows
that the hadronic parameters need to be process-dependent. The
process-dependent hadronic parameters break the isospin symmetry `dynamically'.
A large negative relative phase associated with the internal up quark gluonic
penguin diagram is observed. The weak angle $\gamma$ is found to be
$72.1\pm5.8$ degree, being consistent with the world averaged value,
$72.1\pm5.8$ degree. By a least squares fit to the mixing induced asymmetry
$S(\pi^{0}K_{S})=0.58\pm0.06$, the weak angle $\beta$ is determined to be
$22.9\pm2.1$ degree, which is in a well agreement with the world averaged
value, $22.5\pm4.4\pm0.6$ degree. The model predicts the ratio
$C^{\prime}/T^{\prime}$ (color suppressed/color favored) to be $0.59\pm0.08$.
The above evidences indicate that the model can solve the $B\to\pi K$ puzzle
consistently.

guide the decision of which the words might be deleted or inserted with the
soft attention mechanism under the sequence-to-sequence framework. We conduct

single test image the network identifies that the test image is part of which
image from the images given before. This is a task somehow similar to measuring
image similarity and can be done using a simple CNN. Doing this task manually
by looping can be quite a time consuming problem and won't be a generalizable

training data should be given or in the case of sliding window it takes lot of
time and my algorithm can work with much fewer examples, is totally
unsupervised and works much efficiently. Also, I explain that how unsupervised
algorithm like K-Means or supervised algorithm like K-NN are not good enough to
perform this task. The basic idea is that image encodings are collected for
each image from a CNN, when a test image comes it is replaced by a part of
original image, the encoding is generated using the same network, the frobenius
norm is calculated and if it comes under a tolerance level then the test image
is said to be the part of the original image.

emphasize the importance of stepping beyond basins of attraction. We show an
approach based on viability theory to quantify robust sets in state-action

which allows us to quantify the robustness inherent to the natural dynamics
before designing the control policy or specifying a control objective. We
illustrate our formulation using spring-mass models, simple low dimensional
models of running systems. We then show an example application by optimizing
robustness of a simulated planar monoped, using a gradient-free optimization
scheme. Both case studies result in a nonlinear effective stiffness providing
more robustness.

action selection of autonomous agents under the heading of a single principle.
It suggests biologically plausible explanations for many cognitive phenomena,
including consciousness. In active inference, action selection is driven by an
objective function that evaluates possible future actions with respect to
current, inferred beliefs about the world. Active inference at its core is
independent from extrinsic rewards, resulting in a high level of robustness
across e.g.\ different environments or agent morphologies. In the literature,
paradigms that share this independence have been summarised under the notion of
intrinsic motivations. In general and in contrast to active inference, these
models of motivation come without a commitment to particular inference and
action selection mechanisms. In this article, we study if the inference and
action selection machinery of active inference can also be used by alternatives
to the originally included intrinsic motivation. The perception-action loop
explicitly relates inference and action selection to the environment and agent
memory, and is consequently used as foundation for our analysis. We reconstruct
the active inference approach, locate the original formulation within, and show
how alternative intrinsic motivations can be used while keeping many of the
original features intact. Furthermore, we illustrate the connection to
universal reinforcement learning by means of our formalism. Active inference
research may profit from comparisons of the dynamics induced by alternative
intrinsic motivations. Research on intrinsic motivations may profit from an
additional way to implement intrinsically motivated agents that also share the
biological plausibility of active inference.

challenging problems such as image classification, object detection or decision
making. Their successful employment foots on an enormous demand of compute. The
quantization of network parameters and the processed data has proven a valuable
measure to reduce the challenges of network inference so effectively that the
feasible scope of applications is expanded even into the embedded domain. This
paper describes the making of a real-time object detection in a live video
stream processed on an embedded all-programmable device. The presented case
illustrates how the required processing is tamed and parallelized across both
the CPU cores and the programmable logic and how the most suitable resources
and powerful extensions, such as NEON vectorization, are leveraged for the
individual processing steps. The crafted result is an extended Darknet
framework implementing a fully integrated, end-to-end solution from video
capture over object annotation to video output applying neural network
inference at different quantization levels running at 16~frames per second on
an embedded Zynq UltraScale+ (XCZU3EG) platform.

automatic speech recognition (ASR), hearing aids etc. require an estimation of
only one source from a mixture of many sources. Treating this special case as a
regular SCSS problem where in all constituent sources are given equal priority
in terms of reconstruction may result in a suboptimal separation performance.
In this paper, we tackle the one source separation problem by suitably
modifying the orthodox SCSS framework and focus only on one source at a time.
The proposed approach is a generic framework that can be applied to any
existing SCSS algorithm, improves performance, and scales well when there are
more than two sources in the mixture unlike most existing SCSS methods.
Additionally, existing SCSS algorithms rely on fine hyper-parameter tuning
hence making them difficult to use in practice. Our framework takes a step
towards automatic tuning of the hyper-parameters thereby making our method
better suited for the mixture to be separated and thus practically more useful.
We test our framework on a neural network based algorithm and the results show
an improved performance in terms of SDR and SAR.

experimentally characterize the correlations in quantum dynamics for two- and
four-qubit systems. The method proposed and demonstrated in this work is

frameworks, intended to reduce the effort of developing high performance
parallel applications. However many of these frameworks, based on
Vertex-centric or Edge-centric paradigms suffer from several issues, such as
poor cache utilization, irregular memory accesses, heavy use of synchronization
primitives and theoretical inefficiency, that deteriorate overall performance
and scalability.
  Recently, we proposed a cache and memory efficient partition-centric paradigm
for computing PageRank. In this paper, we generalize this approach to develop a
novel Graph Processing Over Partitions (GPOP) framework that is
cache-efficient, scalable and work-efficient. GPOP induces locality in memory
accesses by increasing granularity of execution to vertex subsets called
'partitions', thereby dramatically improving the cache performance of a variety
of graph algorithms. It achieves high scalability by enabling completely lock
and atomic free computation. GPOP's built-in analytical performance model
enables it to use a hybrid of source and partitioncentric communication modes
in a way that ensures work-efficiency each iteration, while simultaneously
boosting high bandwidth sequential memory accesses.
  We extensively evaluate the performance of GPOP for a variety of graph
algorithms, using several large datasets. We observe that GPOP incurs up to 9x,
6.8x and 5.5x less L2 cache misses compared to Ligra, GraphMat and Galois,
respectively. In terms of execution time, GPOP is upto 19x, 9.3x and 3.6x
faster than Ligra, GraphMat and Galois respectively.

10^{3-5} M_sun) existing in some globular clusters (GCs) and dwarf galaxies,
but IMBHs as a population remain elusive. As a main-sequence star passes too
close by an IMBH it might be tidally captured and disrupted. We study the
long-term accretion and observational consequence of such tidal disruption
events. The disruption radius is hundreds to thousands of the BH's
Schwarzschild radius, so the circularization of the falling-back debris stream
is very inefficient due to weak general relativity effects. Due to this and a
high mass fallback rate, the bound debris initially goes through a ~10 yr long
super-Eddington accretion phase. The photospheric emission of the outflow
ejected during this phase dominates the observable radiation and peaks in the
UV/optical bands with a luminosity of 10^42 erg/s. After the accretion rate
drops below the Eddington rate, the bolometric luminosity follows the
conventional t^{-5/3} power-law decay, and X-rays from the inner accretion disk
start to be seen. Modeling the newly reported IMBH tidal disruption event
candidate 3XMM J2150-0551, we find a general consistency between the data and
predictions. The search for these luminous, long-term events in GCs and nearby
dwarf galaxies could unveil the IMBH population.

15,232 spectra. The synthetic spectra are computed with astrophysical gf-values
derived by comparing synthetic predictions with a very high SNR solar spectrum
and the UVES-U580 spectra of five cool giants. The validity of the NSPs is
assessed by using the UVES-U580 spectra of 2212 stars observed in the framework
of the Gaia-ESO Survey and characterized by homogeneous and accurate
atmospheric parameter values and by detailed chemical compositions. The greater
accuracy of NSPs with respect to spectra from the AMBRE, GES_Grid, PHOENIX,

consistency of the predictions of the different libraries for the UVES-U580
sample stars. The validity of the FSPs is checked by comparing their prediction
with both observed spectral energy distribution and spectral indices. The
comparison of FSPs with SEDs derived from ELODIE, INDO--U.S., and MILES
libraries indicates that the former reproduce the observed flux distributions
within a few percent and without any systematic trend. The good agreement
between observational and synthetic Lick/SDSS indices shows that the predicted
blanketing of FSPs well reproduces the observed one, thus confirming the
reliability of INTRIGOSS FSPs.

the electrohydrodynamic interaction between two deformable droplets in a

performed numerical simulations to study the effect of channel confinement on
the drop trajectories in the presence of a uniform electric field. Two
important varieties of motion are identified in the present analysis, namely
(i) the reversing motion and (ii) the passing over motion. The study suggests
that conversion of the passing over motion to the reversing motion or vice
versa is possible via modulating the strength of the imposed electric field.
Such a conversion of the pattern of droplet migration is also possible in a
confined domain due to change in different electrical properties of the system.
The present numerical model is also able to predict the pattern of the
trajectory of individual droplets depending on the initial distance separating
the two. For example, a smaller initial distance results in a reversing motion
whereas a passing over motion is predicted when the distance between the
droplets is significantly large. However, the final positions of the droplets
are found to be independent of their initial positions. Interestingly, presence
of electric field is found to prevent droplet coalescence to a certain extent
depending on its strength, thus rendering the emulsion stable. A small
deformation asymptotic model is also developed under the assumption of
negligible fluid inertia to support the numerical results for the limiting case
of an unbounded flow. The current investigation successfully presents a novel
technique to predict the precise positions of a system of droplets in a
micro-channel and how electric field can be used as a tool to modulate droplet
trajectories in an emulsion.

amplified when randomness in the pore microstructure is present and therefore
multiple simulations need to be carried out. It is well known that in the limit
of scale-separation, Stokes flow can be accurately approximated by Darcy's law
with an effective diffusivity field depending on viscosity and the pore-matrix
topology. We propose a fully probabilistic, Darcy-type, reduced-order model
which, based on only a few tens of full-order Stokes model runs, is capable of
learning a map from the fine-scale topology to the effective diffusivity and is
maximally predictive of the fine-scale response. The reduced-order model

multi anode photomultiplier tube (MAPMT), is of vital importance for
coded-aperture imaging systems. When coupled with a suitable sensitive detector
(e.g. EJ-299-34 plastic scintillator), output signals of the MAPMT can be
retrieved to infer the interaction location in the pixelated scintillator.
Given the number of anodes in H9500 (256), significant processing power would
be necessary to handle each pulse individually. Therefore, a readout
electronics system was developed, based on resistive network approach, which
reduces the number of output signals to individual X and Y coordinates, and
subsequently allows particle identification. Coordinates retrieved in this
manner can be analysed in real time and used to infer the two-dimensional
location. Particle type can be also exploited by pulse shape discrimination
(PSD) application to the scintillator response. In this study, 169 anodes were
used (due to coded-aperture design rules), and reduced to two X and Y output
signals. These have been digitised using a bespoke FPGA based two channel
14-bit 150 MSPS digitiser. The digital data are transferred to a host
application using UART to USB converter operating at 12 Mbits/s. Promising
results have been observed when the scintillator's response was tested in
single particle field of Cs-137. However, further tests performed in the
mixed-field environment of Cf-252 suggest that faster digitiser may be required
to obtain the required PSD performance.

at larger scales than the strong lensing region in the cluster cores. We built
parametric mass models for three of these GGLs showing simple lensing
configurations, in order to assess the properties of their lens and its
environment. We show that the local shear estimated from the GGLs traces the
gravitational potential of the clusters at 1-2 arcmin radial distance, allowing
us to derive their velocity dispersion. We also find a good agreement between
the strength of the shear measured at the GGL positions through strong-lensing
modelling and the value derived independently from a weak-lensing analysis of
the background sources. Overall, we show the advantages of using single GGL
events in the outskirts of clusters to robustly constrain the local shear, even
when only photometric redshift estimates are known for the source. We argue
that the mass-luminosity scaling relation of cluster members can be tested by
modelling the GGLs found around them, and show that the mass parameters can
vary up to $\sim$30% between the cluster and GGL models assuming this scaling
relation.

of scientific data from a user's perspective, with the Topology ToolKit (TTK),
a recently released open-source library for topological data analysis.
Topological methods have gained considerably in popularity and maturity over
the last twenty years and success stories of established methods have been
documented in a wide range of applications (combustion, chemistry,
astrophysics, material sciences, etc.) with both acquired and simulated data,
in both post-hoc and in-situ contexts. While reference textbooks have been
published on the topic, no tutorial at IEEE VIS has covered this area in recent
years, and never at a software level and from a user's point-of-view. This
tutorial fills this gap by providing a beginner's introduction to topological
methods for practitioners, researchers, students, and lecturers. In particular,
instead of focusing on theoretical aspects and algorithmic details, this
tutorial focuses on how topological methods can be useful in practice for
concrete data analysis tasks such as segmentation, feature extraction or
tracking. The tutorial describes in detail how to achieve these tasks with TTK.
First, after an introduction to topological methods and their application in
data analysis, a brief overview of TTK's main entry point for end users, namely
ParaView, will be presented. Second, an overview of TTK's main features will be
given. A running example will be described in detail, showcasing how to access
TTK's features via ParaView, Python, VTK/C++, and C++. Third, hands-on sessions
will concretely show how to use TTK in ParaView for multiple, representative
data analysis tasks. Fourth, the usage of TTK will be presented for developers,
in particular by describing several examples of visualization and data analysis
projects that were built on top of TTK. Finally, some feedback regarding the
usage of TTK as a teaching platform for topological analysis will be given.
Presenters of this tutorial include experts in topological methods, core
authors of TTK as well as active users, coming from academia, labs, or
industry. A large part of the tutorial will be dedicated to hands-on exercises
and a rich material package (including TTK pre-installs in virtual machines,
code, data, demos, video tutorials, etc.) will be provided to the participants.
This tutorial mostly targets students, practitioners and researchers who are
not experts in topological methods but who are interested in using them in
their daily tasks. We also target researchers already familiar to topological
methods and who are interested in using or contributing to TTK.

to directly access the states of concurrent objects. We also investigate
several important properties of strict linearizability.
  At a high level of abstraction, a concurrent object can be viewed as a

  We present a new NLTE inversion code that is based on the analytical
computation of the response functions. We named the code SNAPI, which is short

several fixed points in the atmosphere, and are assumed to behave as splines in

hundreds of solar masses) make them the most important reservoirs of complex
organic molecules (COMs), including key species for prebiotic processes. This
rich chemistry is thought to be the result of the evaporation of dust grain
mantles by the strong radiation of the deeply embedded early-type star(s). Our
own Sun may have been born in a high-mass star-forming region, so our Earth may
have inherited the primordial chemical composition of its parental hot core
region, as suggested by recent studies of oxygen and sulfur chemistry in
comets. In this chapter, we discuss how the next generation Very Large Array
(ngVLA) can help us to study the emission of heavy COMs in both low- and
high-mass star-forming regions. The emission of COMs is important not only
because it allows us to understand how chemistry may have developed to
eventually form life in our Earth, but also because COMs are a powerful tool
for studying the physical properties and kinematics of the dense regions very
close to the central protostars.

magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the magnetic interactions between a
solar type star and HJ using the publicly available code PLUTO. The results are
used to calculate the efficiency of the ECMI at producing detectable radio
emission from the planets magnetosphere. We also calculate the frequency of the
ECMI emission, providing an upper and lower bounds, placing it at the limits of
detectability due to Earth's ionospheric cutoff of $\sim 10 \ \mathrm{MHz}$.
The incident kinetic and magnetic power available to the ECMI is also
determined and a flux of $0.069 \ \mathrm{mJy}$ for an observer at $10 \
\mathrm{pc}$ is calculated. The magnetosphere is also characterized and an
analysis of the bow shock which forms upstream of the planet is conducted. This
shock corresponds to the thin shell model for a colliding wind system. A result
consistent with a colliding wind system. The simulation results show that the
ECMI process is completely inhibited by the planets expanding atmosphere, due
to absorption of UV radiation form the host star. The density, velocity,
temperature and magnetic field of the planetary wind are found to result in a
magnetosphere where the plasma frequency is raised above that due to the ECMI
process making the planet undetectable at radio MHz frequencies.

synthetic spectra (calculated by means of 1D, spherically symmetric computer
codes) with observations. Certain stellar atmospheres, however, show strong
deviations from spherical symmetry, and need to be treated in 3D. Aims: We
present a newly developed 3D radiative transfer code, tailored to the solution
of the radiation field in rapidly expanding stellar atmospheres. We apply our
code to the continuum transfer in wind-ablation models, and to the UV resonance
line formation in magnetic winds. Methods: We have used a 3D finite-volume
method for the solution of the equation of radiative transfer, to study
continuum- and line-scattering problems. Convergence has been accelerated by a
non-local approximate Lambda-iteration scheme. Particular emphasis has been put
on careful (spherically symmetric) test cases. Results: Typical errors of the
source functions, when compared to 1D solutions, are of the order of 10-20 %,
and increase for optically thick continua. In circumstellar discs, the
radiation temperatures in the (optically thin) transition region from wind to
disc are quite similar to corresponding values in the wind. For MHD simulations
of dynamical magnetospheres, the line profiles, calculated with our 3D code,
agree well with previous solutions using a 3D-SEI method. When compared with
profiles resulting from the `analytic dynamical magnetosphere' (ADM) model,
significant differences become apparent. Conclusions: Due to similar radiation
temperatures in the wind and the transition region to the disc, the same
line-strength distribution can be applied within radiation hydrodynamic
calculations for circumstellar discs in `accreting high-mass stars'. To
properly describe the UV line formation in dynamical magnetospheres, the ADM
model needs to be further developed, at least in a large part of the outer
wind.

magnetic fields and (ii) 2D, null point containing fields which are locally
imbalanced ('null-collapse' or 'X-point collapse'). Within the framework of
resistive MHD, we simulate the full nonlinear evolution through three distinct
phases: the initial implosion, its eventual halting mechanism, and subsequent
evolution post-halting. In a parameter study, we find the scaling with
resistivity of current sheet properties at the halting time is in good
agreement - in both geometries - with that inferred from a known 1D similarity
solution. We find that the halting of the implosions occurs rapidly after
reaching the diffusion scale by sudden Ohmic heating of the dense plasma within
the current sheet, which provides a pressure gradient sufficient to oppose
further collapse and decelerate the converging flow. This back-pressure grows
to exceed that required for force balance and so the post-implosion evolution
is characterised by the consequences of the current sheet `bouncing' outwards.
These are: (i) the launching of propagating fast MHD waves (shocks) outwards
and (ii) the width-wise expansion of the current sheet itself. The expansion is
only observed to stall in the 2D case, where the pressurisation is relieved by
outflow in the reconnection jets. In the 2D case, we quantify the maximum
amount of current sheet expansion as it scales with resistivity, and analyse
the structure of the reconnection region which forms post-expansion, replete
with Petschek-type slow shocks and fast termination shocks.

suprathermal electrons; such electrons play a major role in energy deposition
in the ambient atmosphere and hence the atmospheric response to flare heating.
Historically the transport of these particles has been approximated through a
deterministic approach in which first-order secular energy loss to electrons in
the ambient target is treated as the dominant effect, with second-order
diffusive terms (in both energy and angle) being generally either treated as a
small correction or neglected. However, it has recently been pointed out that
while neglect of diffusion in energy may indeed be negligible, diffusion in
angle is of the same order as deterministic scattering and hence must be
included. Here we therefore investigate the effect of angular scattering on the
energy deposition profile in the flaring atmosphere. A relatively simple
compact expression for the spatial distribution of energy deposition into the
ambient plasma is presented and compared with the corresponding deterministic
result. For unidirectional injection there is a significant shift in heating
from the lower corona to the upper corona; this shift is much smaller for
isotropic injection. We also compare the heating profiles due to return current
Ohmic heating in the diffusional and deterministic models.

increase in the use of RDMA in datacenter networks. To achieve good
performance, RoCE requires a lossless network which is in turn achieved by
enabling Priority Flow Control (PFC) within the network. However, PFC brings
with it a host of problems such as head-of-the-line blocking, congestion
spreading, and occasional deadlocks. Rather than seek to fix these issues, we
instead ask: is PFC fundamentally required to support RDMA over Ethernet?
  We show that the need for PFC is an artifact of current RoCE NIC designs
rather than a fundamental requirement. We propose an improved RoCE NIC (IRN)
design that makes a few simple changes to the RoCE NIC for better handling of
packet losses. We show that IRN (without PFC) outperforms RoCE (with PFC) by
6-83% for typical network scenarios. Thus not only does IRN eliminate the need
for PFC, it improves performance in the process! We further show that the
changes that IRN introduces can be implemented with modest overheads of about
3-10% to NIC resources. Based on our results, we argue that research and
industry should rethink the current trajectory of network support for RDMA.

negative. The paramagnetic term scales with $\mu$ and changes sign depending on
the doping level. Altogether, the Knight shift is predicted to vanish or even
change sign upon changing the doping or the temperature, making it a sensitive
tool to identify Weyl points. We also calculate the Korringa relation for Weyl
semimetals which shows an unusual energy dependence rather than being constant

nonuniform, terrace-like critical state, in which individual domains are
occupied by a constant number of vortices per pinning site. The
magnetoresistance, probed at low current densities, is hysteretic and angle

convolutional neural regression network for an automatic, outlier tolerant

so-called `slipper' and `croissant' shapes depending on the prevailing flow
conditions and the cell-intrinsic parameters. Whereas croissants mostly occur
at low shear rates, slippers evolve at higher flow velocities. With our method,
we are able to find the transition point between both `phases' of stable shapes
which is of high interest to ensuing theoretical studies and numerical
simulations. Using statistically based thresholds, from our data, we obtain
so-called phase diagrams which are compared to manual evaluations.
Prospectively, our concept allows us to perform objective analyses of
measurements for a variety of flow conditions and to receive comparable
results. Moreover, the proposed procedure enables unbiased studies on the
influence of drugs on flow properties of single RBCs and the resulting
macroscopic change of the flow behavior of whole blood.

the fluctuation reflectometry operates at 20 fixed frequency points in

8-channel 14-bit 250MSPS digitizers and ten 8-channel 12-bit 60MSPS digitizers.
A self-developed 5-channel 250MSPS arbiter waveform generator (AWG) is used to
control voltage control oscillators for frequency sweeping. A trigger and clock
manger and a timing module receive the trigger and clock signal from central
controller and synchronize all the digitizers and the AWG. The total data rate
from digitizers is 2515 MB/S. The Data from digitizers is streamed to a disk

This requires an adaptation of standard supervised classifiers in order to

classification, several benchmark datasets and numerous classifiers are
available for MIL. When performing a comparison of different MIL classifiers,
it is important to understand the differences of the datasets, used in the

datasets may elicit very similar behaviour in classifiers, and vice versa. This
has implications for what kind of conclusions may be drawn from the comparison
results. We aim to give an overview of the variability of available benchmark

measure, based on the differences between the ROC-curves obtained by different
classifiers, and embed this dataset dissimilarity matrix into a low-dimensional

robustness to noise and provide a well founded principle for determining the

notion of refinement of observation and to understand the homological
properties of branchings and mergings of execution paths. Roughly speaking,
they are Grandis' $d$-spaces without an underlying topological space. They just
have an underlying homotopy type. This note is twofold. First, we give a new
construction of the model category structure of flows which is more conceptual
thanks to Isaev's results. It avoids the use of difficult topological
arguments. Secondly, we prove that this model category is left determined by
adapting an argument due to Olschok. The introduction contains some
speculations about what we expect to find out by localizing this minimal model
category structure.

Optimizing neural architecture for device-related objectives is immensely
crucial for deploying deep networks on portable devices with limited computing
resources. We propose DPP-Net: Device-aware Progressive Search for
Pareto-optimal Neural Architectures, optimizing for both device-related (e.g.,
inference time and memory usage) and device-agnostic (e.g., accuracy and model
size) objectives. DPP-Net employs a compact search space inspired by current
state-of-the-art mobile CNNs, and further improves search efficiency by
adopting progressive search (Liu et al. 2017). Experimental results on CIFAR-10
are poised to demonstrate the effectiveness of Pareto-optimal networks found by
DPP-Net, for three different devices: (1) a workstation with Titan X GPU, (2)
NVIDIA Jetson TX1 embedded system, and (3) mobile phone with ARM Cortex-A53.
Compared to CondenseNet and NASNet (Mobile), DPP-Net achieves better
performances: higher accuracy and shorter inference time on various devices.
Additional experimental results show that models found by DPP-Net also achieve
considerably-good performance on ImageNet as well.

similar discrepancy is found between the CMS pPb data and NLO predictions e.g.
with the EPPS16 nuclear modifications imposed on the CT14 proton PDFs. When a

good agreement between the data and EPPS16 is found, except in some bins at
backward rapidities corresponding to large x of the nucleus. To assess the
impact of these data on the EPPS16 nuclear PDFs, we use a non-quadratic
extension of the Hessian PDF reweighting method. A significant reduction in

recent studies, however, reveal diverse SEDs among RV Tauri stars, suggesting
they may occupy other evolutionary channels as well. The aim of this paper is
to present the diverse SED characteristics of RV Tauri stars and investigate
their evolutionary nature as a function of their SEDs. We carried out a
systematic study of RV Tauri stars in the SMC and LMC because of their known
distances and hence luminosities. Their SEDs were classified in three groups:
dusty (disc-type), non-dusty (non-IR) and uncertain. A period-luminosity-
colour (PLC) relation was calibrated. The luminosities from the PLC were
complemented with the ones found using their SEDs and the stars were placed on
the HR-diagram. The four main results from this study are: 1) RV Tauri stars
with a clear IR-excess have disc-type SEDs, which indicates that the dust is
trapped in a stable disc. Given the strong link between disc-type SEDs and
binarity in the Galaxy, we postulate that these are binaries as well. These
cover a range of luminosities and we argue that the more luminous ones are
post-AGB stars while the lower luminosity ones are likely post-Red Giant Branch
(post-RGB) stars. 2) Two of these objects have variable mean brightness with
periods of 916 and 850 days, respectively, caused by variable extinction during
orbital motion. 3) The non-dusty RV Tauri stars and the objects with an
uncertain SED evolve such that the circumstellar dust has dispersed. If they
are single stars, they are post-AGB objects of low initial mass ($<$ 1.25
M$_\odot$), while if they are binaries, the low-luminosity part of the sample
are likely post-RGB stars. 4) We find that RV Tauri stars with dust are on
average more luminous than the rest of the sample.

perturbations on nontrivial field configurations is determined by effective
metrics. Generalized scalar-tensor theories belong in this class and this
implies that the matter fields and gravitational perturbations do not
necessarily experience the same causal structure. Motivated by this, we explore
the causal structure of black holes as perceived by scalar fields in the
Horndeski class. We consider linearized perturbations on a fixed background
metric that describes a generic black hole. The effective metric that
determines the propagation of these perturbations does not generally coincide
with the background metric (to which matter fields couple minimally). Assuming
that the metric and the scalar respect stationarity and that the surface
gravity of the horizon is constant, we prove that Killing horizons of the
background metric are always Killing horizons of the effective metric as well.
Hence, scalar perturbations cannot escape the region that matter fields
perceive as the interior of the black hole. This result does not depend on
asymptotics but only on local considerations and does not make any reference to
no-hair theorems. We then demonstrate that, when one relaxes the stationarity
assumption for the scalar, solutions where the horizons of the effective and
the background metrics do not match can be found in the decoupling limit.

scenarios in condensed matter physics. The observation of these disordered
magnetic states is particularly pervasive amongst a class of materials known as
frustrated magnets, in which the competition between various magnetic exchange
interactions prevents the system from adopting long-range magnetic order at low
temperatures. Spin liquids continue to be of great interest due to their exotic
nature and the possibility that they may support fractionalised excitations,
such as Majorana fermions. Systems that allow for such phenomena are not only
fascinating from a fundamental perspective but may also be practically
significant in future technologies based on quantum computation. Here we show
that the underlying antiferromagnetic sublattice in TbInO$_3$ undergoes a
crystal field induced triangular-to-honeycomb dilution at low temperatures. The
absence of a conventional magnetic ordering transition at the lowest measurable
temperatures indicates that another critical mechanism must govern in the
ground state selection of TbInO$_3$. We propose that anisotropic exchange

untimely death. The most common heart abnormality is arrhythmia, which is
simply irregular beating of the heart. A prediction system for the early
intervention and prevention of heart diseases, including cardiovascular
diseases (CDVs) and arrhythmia, is important. This paper introduces the
classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) heartbeats into normal or abnormal.
The approach is based on the combination of swarm optimization algorithms with
a modified PannTompkins algorithm (MPTA) and support vector machines (SVMs).
The MPTA was implemented to remove ECG noise, followed by the application of
the extended features extraction algorithm (EFEA) for ECG feature extraction.
Then, elephant herding optimization (EHO) was used to find a subset of ECG
features from a larger feature pool that provided better classification
performance than that achieved using the whole set. Finally, SVMs were used for
classification. The results show that the EHOSVM approach achieved good
classification results in terms of five statistical indices: accuracy, 93.31%;
sensitivity, 45.49%; precision, 46.45%; F-measure, 45.48%; and specificity,
45.48%. Furthermore, the results demonstrate a clear improvement in accuracy

analyzing the structure and function of molecules, and for performing
three-dimensional imaging of the spin density. At the heart of NMR
spectrometers is the detection of electromagnetic radiation, in the form of a
free induction decay (FID) signal, generated by nuclei precessing around an
applied magnetic field. While conventional NMR requires signals from 1e12 or
more nuclei, recent advances in sensitive magnetometry have dramatically
lowered this number to a level where few or even individual nuclear spins can
be detected. It is natural to ask whether continuous FID detection can still be
applied at the single spin level, or whether quantum back-action modifies or
even suppresses the NMR response. Here we report on tracking of single nuclear
spin precession using periodic weak measurements. Our experimental system
consists of carbon-13 nuclear spins in diamond that are weakly interacting with
the electronic spin of a nearby nitrogen-vacancy center, acting as an optically
readable meter qubit. We observe and minimize two important effects of quantum
back-action: measurement-induced decoherence and frequency synchronization with
the sampling clock. We use periodic weak measurements to demonstrate sensitive,
high-resolution NMR spectroscopy of multiple nuclear spins with a priori
unknown frequencies. Our method may provide the optimum route for performing
single-molecule NMR at atomic resolution.

into subgraphs recursively, and a lite informative dendrogram is constructed
based on the divisions. The reduction consists of three steps: selection,
connection, and partition. First a subset of vertices of the graph are selected
as representatives to build a concise graph. The representatives are
re-connected to maintain a consistent structure with the previous graph. If
possible, the concise graph is divided into subgraphs, and each subgraph is
further reduced recursively until the termination condition is met. We discuss
the approach, along with several selection and connection methods, in detail
both theoretically and experimentally in this paper. Our implementations run in
linear time and achieve outstanding performance on various types of datasets.
Experimental results show that they outperform state-of-the-art clustering
algorithms with significantly less computing resource requirements.

the best of these algorithms, the Inductive Miner, scored only 147 correct

the rule-based log skeleton model, which is closely related to the Declare

39 and up to 2100 km/s in the following observations. Spectral lines attributed
to low ionization potential transitions in the interstellar medium are also

For instance, configuration settings adjusted by sending PUT request to the

constrained devices and stores (or updates) information that is important to
restore dynamic states. When a node reports a reboot, the state directory
replays the packets that generated the dynamic state so that all dynamic states

optical brightness and stellar mass, where (1) the clustering amplitude of
optically brighter galaxies at a given separation is larger than that of
optically fainter systems, (2) the small scale clustering properties (e.g. the
strength, the scale at which the signal relative to the fiducial power law
plateaus) of star forming galaxies appear to differ as a function of increasing
optical brightness of galaxies. According to cross and mark correlation
analyses, the former result is largely driven by the increased dust content in
optically bright star forming galaxies. The latter could be interpreted as
evidence of a correlation between interaction-scale and optical brightness of
galaxies, where physical evidence of interactions between optically bright star
formers, likely hosted within relatively massive halos, persist over larger

particular surface properties in an undefined state. Here we present an in
depth investigation of structural and electronic properties of GaAsBi epilayers
grown by molecular beam epitaxy with high (001) crystalline order and
well-defined surface structures evident from low-energy electron diffraction.
X-ray and ultraviolet photoemission spectrocopy as well as angle-resolved
photoemission data at variable photon energies allows to disentangle a Bi-rich
surface layer with $(1\times3)$ symmetry from the effects of Bi atoms
incorporated in the GaAs bulk matrix. The influence of Bi concentrations up to
$\approx 1$\% integrated in the GaAs bulk are visible in angle-resolved
photoemission spectra after mild ion bombardment and subsequent annealing
steps. Interpretation of our results is obtained via density functional theory
simulations of bulk and $\beta 2(2\times 4)$ reconstructed slab geometries with
and without Bi. Bi-induced energy shifts in the dispersion of GaAs heavy and
light hole bulk bands are evident both in experiment and theory, which are
relevant for modulations in the optical band gap and thus optoelectronic
applications.

account both the surface and quasi-two-dimensional bulk states. We apply a
low-energy expansion of the Hamiltonian up to the third order in momentum and
take into account the vertex corrections arising due to the short range
disorder. Hexagonal warping gives rise to the additional anisotropic components
in the spin conductivity tensor. Typically, isotropic part of the spin
conductivity is larger than anisotropic one. The helical regime for the bulk
states, in which the electrons in the Fermi level have the same projection of
the spin on the direction of momentum, have been studied in a more detail. In
this regime, a substantial increase of the spin conductivity contribution from
the bulk states at the Fermi level is observed. We find that the bulk spin
conductivity is insensitive to disorder if Rashba spin-orbit coupling is larger
than disorder strength, otherwise, it is strongly suppressed. The contribution
to the spin conductivity from the surface states is almost independent of the
chemical potential, robust to disorder and its value is comparable to the spin
conductivity contribution from the bulk states per layer. The obtained results
are in agreement with experimental data.

methods that recursively partition the covariate space based on some measure of

classification and regression tree algorithm, first creates a large tree by
recursively partitioning the covariate space using some splitting criteria and
then selects the final tree from all subtrees of the large tree. In the context
of subgroup identification, calculation of the splitting criteria and the
evaluation measure used for final tree selection rely on comparing differences
in means between the treatment and control arm. When covariates are prognostic
for the outcome, covariate adjusted estimators have the ability to improve
efficiency compared to using differences in means between the treatment and

can be used to both make splitting decisions and for final tree selection. The
performance of the resulting covariate adjusted recursive partitioning

constructed as Gibbs path measures satisfying the corresponding DLR equation.
The multiplicity of such measures is then treated as the existence of phase

Matsubara functions corresponding to the global states. The equilibrium
dynamics of finite subsystems can also be described by means of these
functions. Then three basic results of this theory are presented and discussed:

which detects and corrects any combination of $E$ errors (unknown location) and
$Z$ erasures (known location) provided that $Z+2E \leq 4$. We investigate some
scenarios for error correction beyond the code's minimum distance, using list
decoding. We describe a decoding algorithm with quasi-logarithmic time
complexity, when parallel processing is used: $\approx O(\log N)$ where $N$ is
the number of disks in the array (similar to RAID 6).
  By comparison, the error correcting code implemented by RAID 6 allows error
detection and correction only when $(E,Z)=(1,0)$, $(0,1)$, or $(0,2)$. Hence,
when in degraded mode (i.e., when $Z \geq 1$), RAID 6 loses its ability for
detecting and correcting random errors (i.e., $E=0$), leading to data loss
known as silent data corruption. In contrast, the proposed code does not
experience silent data corruption unless $Z \geq 3$.
  The aforementioned properties of our code, the relative simplicity of
implementation, vastly improved data protection, and low computational
complexity of the decoding algorithm, make our code a natural successor to RAID
6. As this code is based on the use of quintuple parity, this justifies the
name PentaRAID for the RAID technology implementing the ideas of the current

when the p-cycle is consumed to restore traffic after a failure. As the
probability of multiple link failure is high for a large network, it also means
that with higher probability, on the second failure, protection may not be

Herschel Hi-GAL compact-clump catalogue to examine trends in evolutionary stage
over large spatial scales in the inner Galaxy. We examine the relationship
between the fraction of clumps with embedded star formation (the star-forming
fraction, or SFF) and other measures of star-formation activity. Based on a
positive correlation between SFF and evolutionary indicators such as the
luminosity-to-mass ratio, we assert that the SFF principally traces the average
evolutionary state of a sample and must depend on the local fraction of
rapidly-evolving, high-mass young stellar objects. The spiral-arm tangent point
longitudes show small excesses in the SFF, though these can be accounted for by
a small number of the most massive clusters, just 7.6% of the total number of
clumps in the catalogue. This suggests that while the arms tend to be home to
the Galaxy's massive clusters, the remaining 92.4% of Hi-GAL clumps in our
catalogue do not show an enhancement of star formation within arms. Globally,
the SFF is highest at the Galactic midplane and inner longitudes. We find no
significant trend in evolutionary stage as a function of position across spiral
arms at the tangent-point longitudes. This indicates that the angular offset
observed between gas and stars, if coordinated by a density wave, is not
evident at the clump phase; alternatively, the onset of star formation is not
triggered by the spiral density wave.

that income inequality decreases in most states, with a pronounced degree of
heterogeneity in terms of shapes and magnitudes of the dynamic responses. By
contrast, some few states, mostly located in the West and South census region,
display increasing levels of income inequality over time. We find that this
directional pattern in responses is mainly driven by the income composition and
labor market fundamentals. In addition, forecast error variance decompositions
allow for a quantitative assessment of the importance of uncertainty shocks in
explaining income inequality. The findings highlight that volatility shocks
account for a considerable fraction of forecast error variance for most states
considered. Finally, a regression-based analysis sheds light on the driving
forces behind differences in state-specific inequality responses.

all having similar electronic band structure and is an ideal system to explore
the rich physics of Lorentz symmetry violating Dirac fermions. In this work, we
present a detailed analysis on the magnetotransport properties of VAl$_{3}$. A
large, non-saturating magnetoresistance has been observed. Hall resistivity
reveals the presence of two types of charge carriers with high mobility. Our
measurements show a large planar Hall effect in this material, which is robust
and can be easily detectable up to high temperature. This phenomenon originates
from the relativistic chiral anomaly and non-trivial Berry curvature, which
validates the theoretical prediction of the Dirac semimetal phase in VAl$_{3}$.

electron transport through quantum dots or molecules that are weakly coupled to
macroscopic electrodes. In the Coulomb blockade regime, however, cotunneling
processes dominate. Cotunneling is an inherently quantum phenomenon and thus
gives rise to interesting observations, such as an increase in the current shot
noise. Since cotunneling processes are inherently fast compared to the
sequential processes, it is of interest to examine the short time behaviour of
systems where cotunneling plays a role, and whether these systems display
nonrenewal statistics. We consider three questions in this paper. Given that an
electron has tunneled from the source to the drain via a cotunneling or
sequential process, what is the waiting time until another electron cotunnels
from the source to the drain? What are the statistical properties of these
waiting time intervals? How does cotunneling affect the statistical properties
of a system with strong inelastic electron-electron interactions? In answering
these questions, we extend the existing formalism for waiting time
distributions in single electron transport to include cotunneling processes via
an $n$-resolved Markovian master equation. We demonstrate that for a single
resonant level the analytic waiting time distribution including cotunneling
processes yields information on individual tunneling amplitudes. For both a SRL
and an Anderson impurity deep in the Coulomb blockade there is a nonzero
probability for two electrons to cotunnel to the drain with zero waiting time
inbetween. Furthermore, we show that at high voltages cotunneling processes
slightly modify the nonrenewal behaviour of an Anderson impurity with a strong
inelastic electron-electron interaction.

generalization of weighted automata over strings and trees to arbitrary
families of labeled graphs (and hypergraphs). A GWM generically associates a
labeled graph with a tensor network and computes a value by successive
contractions directed by its edges. In this paper, we consider the problem of
learning GWMs defined over the graph family of pictures (or 2-dimensional
words). As a proof of concept, we consider regression and classification tasks
over the simple Bars & Stripes and Shifting Bits picture languages and provide
an experimental study investigating whether these languages can be learned in
the form of a GWM from positive and negative examples using gradient-based
methods. Our results suggest that this is indeed possible and that
investigating the use of gradient-based methods to learn picture series and
functions computed by GWMs over other families of graphs could be a fruitful

equations. In a large problem set, approximations can take days or weeks to
evaluate, yet the bulk of computation may occur within a single loop nest. The
modelling process for researchers is not straightforward either, requiring
models with differential equations to be translated into stencil kernels, then
optimised separately. One tool that seeks to speed up and eliminate mistakes
from this tedious procedure is Devito, used to efficiently employ
finite-difference methods.
  In this work, we implement time-tiling, a loop nest optimisation, in Devito
yielding a decrease in runtime of up to 45%, and at least 20% across stencils
from the acoustic wave equation family, widely used in Devito's target domain
of seismic imaging. We present an estimator for arithmetic intensity under
time-tiling and a model to predict runtime improvements in stencil

implement recurrent neural networks with long short-term memory (LSTM) cells
because they are capable of handling nonlinear dynamics and long term temporal
dependencies present in human motions. Next, we train a refiner network using
an adversarial loss, similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), such
that the refined motion sequences are indistinguishable from real motion
capture data using a discriminative network. We embed contact information into
the generative deep learning model to further improve the performance of our
generative model. The resulting model is appealing to motion synthesis and
control because it is compact, contact-aware, and can generate an infinite
number of naturally looking motions with infinite lengths. Our experiments show
that motions generated by our deep learning model are always highly realistic
and comparable to high-quality motion capture data. We demonstrate the power
and effectiveness of our models by exploring a variety of applications, ranging
from random motion synthesis, online/offline motion control, and motion
filtering. We show the superiority of our generative model by comparison

wide range of social challenges, from organizational dynamics to team
performance. Focusing on the latter, a novel dataset that captures the planned
efforts to deliver a large-scale, engineered system is introduced. In detail,
this dataset is composed of a total of 271 unique individuals, responsible for
the delivery of a total of 721 tasks spread across a period of 745 days. The
focus of this analysis is on the collaboration network between individuals,
captured by their co-assignment in the delivery of particular tasks, and their
dynamical patterns. Results indicate that the delivery of some tasks depends on
disproportionately large collaborations, making them intrinsically harder to
manage compared to tasks which depend on small, or no, collaborations.
Similarly, some tasks require a disproportionately diverse set of skills to be
completed, further enhancing their intrinsic complexity. Shifting focus to the
topology of the contribution network, an abrupt emergence, and subsequent
contraction, of a single large cluster is observed. This phenomenon corresponds
to the emergence of an increasingly large and cohesive team, and its subsequent
decomposition. In addition, the evolution of this cluster tightly follows the
number of active tasks, suggesting that large teams are a natural way to
respond to increased workload. These findings provide new insight on the
underlying team dynamics that govern coordinated collective activity in
general, and in the context of project delivery specifically.

interesting for mass production optics like in the automotive industry, but

regression of the PSF with an artificial neural network (ANN). In this work we
examine two important aspects of this model: the spatial resolution and the
accuracy of the model. Measurement and simulation of a PSF can have a much
higher resolution then the typical pixel size used in current camera sensors,
especially those for the automotive industry. We discuss the influence this has
on on the topology of the ANN and the final application where the modeled PSF
is actually used. Another important influence on the accuracy of the trained
ANN is the error metric which is used during training. The PSF is a distinctly
non-linear function, which varies strongly over field and defocus, but
nonetheless exhibits strong symmetries and spatial relations. Therefore we
examine different distance and similarity measures and discuss its influence on
the modeling performance of the ANN.

(NLP) tasks individually. However, general NLP models cannot emerge within a
paradigm that focuses on the particularities of a single metric, dataset, and
task. We introduce the Natural Language Decathlon (decaNLP), a challenge that
spans ten tasks: question answering, machine translation, summarization,
natural language inference, sentiment analysis, semantic role labeling,
zero-shot relation extraction, goal-oriented dialogue, semantic parsing, and
commonsense pronoun resolution. We cast all tasks as question answering over a
context. Furthermore, we present a new Multitask Question Answering Network
(MQAN) jointly learns all tasks in decaNLP without any task-specific modules or
parameters in the multitask setting. MQAN shows improvements in transfer
learning for machine translation and named entity recognition, domain
adaptation for sentiment analysis and natural language inference, and zero-shot
capabilities for text classification. We demonstrate that the MQAN's
multi-pointer-generator decoder is key to this success and performance further
improves with an anti-curriculum training strategy. Though designed for
decaNLP, MQAN also achieves state of the art results on the WikiSQL semantic
parsing task in the single-task setting. We also release code for procuring and
processing data, training and evaluating models, and reproducing all
experiments for decaNLP.

many fields. However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples which are
samples with imperceptible perturbations while dramatically misleading the
DNNs. Moreover, adversarial examples can be used to perform an attack on
various kinds of DNN based systems, even if the adversary has no access to the
underlying model. Many defense methods have been proposed, such as obfuscating
gradients of the networks or detecting adversarial examples. However it is
proved out that these defense methods are not effective or cannot resist
secondary adversarial attacks. In this paper, we point out that steganalysis
can be applied to adversarial examples detection, and propose a method to
enhance steganalysis features by estimating the probability of modifications
caused by adversarial attacks. Experimental results show that the proposed
method can accurately detect adversarial examples. Moreover, secondary
adversarial attacks cannot be directly performed to our method because our
method is not based on a neural network but based on high-dimensional
artificial features and FLD (Fisher Linear Discriminant) ensemble.

mirrors forming the Fabry-P\'{e}rot microfilter. One of the mirrors is
deposited on a solid cube and another one on a thinner wall subjected to
bending under the influence of the attractive Casimir force and repulsive force
due to the pressure of light from a continuous laser amplified in the resonator
of a microfilter. The separation distance between the mirrors should only
slightly exceed the half wavelength of the laser light. It is shown that in
this case the resonance condition in the microfilter alternatively obeys and
breaks down resulting in the periodic pulses of the transmitted light. The
Casimir pressure is calculated taking into account an anisotropy of the
dielectric permittivity of a metal at several first Matsubara frequencies. The
reflectivity properties of atomically thin metallic mirrors in the optical
spectral range are found using the experimentally consistent phenomenological
approach developed earlier in the literature. The specific values of all
parameters, found for the microfilter made of quartz glass with Ag mirrors,
demonstrate its workability. The proposed optical chopper may find prospective
applications in the emerging field of nanotechnology exploiting the effects of
quantum fluctuations.

systems have two ubiquitous architectural features not shared with typical

  Unconstrained Optimization Problems",,,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently the engineering optimization problems require large computational
demands and long solution time even on high multi-processors computational
devices. In this paper, an OpenMP inspired parallel version of the whale
optimization algorithm (PWOA) to obtain enhanced computational throughput and
global search capability is presented. It automatically detects the number of
available processors and divides the workload among them to accomplish the
effective utilization of the available resources. PWOA is applied on twenty
unconstrained optimization functions on multiple dimensions and five
constrained optimization engineering functions. The proposed parallelism PWOA
algorithms performance is evaluated using parallel metrics such as speedup,
efficiency. The comparison illustrates that the proposed PWOA algorithm has
obtained the same results while exceeding the sequential version in
performance. Furthermore, PWOA algorithm in the term of computational time and
speed of parallel metric was achieved better results over the sequential
processing compared to the standard WOA.

Synchronous Electric Charge Extraction (SC-SECE). The SC-SECE strategy includes
a tunable short-circuit time thanks to two tuning parameters, $\phi_S$ and
$\Delta\phi$. $\phi_S$ stands for the phase between the mechanical displacement
extrema and the energy harvesting event. $\Delta\phi$ stands for the angular
time spent in the short-circuit phase. The theoretical analysis and modelling
of this short-circuit influences are derived in this paper. When associated
with highly coupled harvesters, it is shown that both the harvested power and
bandwidth are greatly improved. These results have been numerically validated
and they demonstrate the potential of this strategy for extending the bandwidth
of piezoelectric vibration energy harvesters.

These processes are usually numerically computed by classical methods like
finite element method, finite volume method, etc. The disadvantage of these
methods remains in the computational time. The convergence and accuracy require
a small step-time and a small mesh size, which is expensive in computational
time and can induce a spurious oscillation. In order to avoid this problem, we
propose a Self-organized Gradient Percolation algorithm. This method permits to
reduce the CPU time drastically.

  membranes",,"Thin Solid Films, Volume 660, 30 August 2018, Pages 88-100","10.1016/j.tsf.2018.04.005",,"physics.app-ph cond-mat.soft physics.ins-det","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Buckled membranes become ever more important with further miniaturization and
development of ultra-thin film based systems. It is well established that the
bulge test method, generally considered the gold standard for characterizing
freestanding thin films, is unsuited to characterize buckled membranes, because
of compressive residual stresses and a negligible out-of-plane bending
stiffness. When pressurized, buckled membranes immediately start entering the
ripple regime, but they typically plastically deform or fracture before
reaching the cylindrical regime. In this paper the bulge test method is
extended to enable characterization of buckled freestanding ultra-thin
membranes in the ripple regime. In a combined experimental-numerical approach,
the advanced technique of digital height correlation was first extended towards
the sub-micron scale, to enable measurement of the highly varying local 3D
strain and curvature fields on top of a single ripple in a total region of
interest as small as approximately 25 microns. Subsequently, a finite element
(FE) model was set up to analyze the post-buckled membrane under pressure
loading. In the seemingly complex ripple configuration, a suitable combination
of local region of interest and pressure range was identified for which the
stress-strain state can be extracted from the local strain and curvature
fields. This enables the extraction of both the Young's modulus and Poisson's
ratio from a single bulge sample, contrary to the conventional bulge test
method. Virtual experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, while
real proof of principle of the method was demonstrated for fragile specimens
with rather narrow ( approximately 25 microns) ripples.

radial geometry in a petroleum reservoir. The result is a space-fractional
generalization of the diffusivity model with an arbitrary order that explains
the degree of heterogeneity of the medium (a continuous spectrum of zero to one
where zero heterogeneity equates to homogeneity). An implicit unconditionally
stable numerical difference scheme of the linear form of the derived model is
used to illustrate deviations of the model from the homogeneous medium. The
variation of the order produces additional localized pressure drops during flow
which is congruous with fluid inhibition effect of heterogeneity..
