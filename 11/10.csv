radiative efficiency, much less than one percent of their Eddington limit.
Nevertheless, their main energy release may be mechanical, opposite to powerful
AGN classes like Seyfert and Quasars. This work reports on the jet-driven
mechanical energy and the corresponding mass outflow deposited by the jet in
the central 170~parsecs of the nearby LLAGN ESO428-G14. The jet kinetic output
is traced through the coronal line [Si vi] $\lambda$19641 \AA. It is shown that
its radial extension, up to hundreds of parsecs, requires a combination of
photoionization by the central source and shock excitation as its origin. From
the energetics of the ionized gas it is found that the mass outflow rate of the
coronal gas is in the range from 3$-8$~M$\odot$~yr$^{-1}$, comparable to those
estimated from H I gas at kiloparsec scales in powerful radio galaxies.

developments of measurement protocols, the theory of quantum thermometry will
decisively impinge and shape the forthcoming quantum technologies. While
current quantum thermometric methods differ greatly depending on the
experimental platform, the achievable precision, and the temperature range of
interest, the theory of quantum thermometry is built under a unifying framework
at the crossroads of quantum metrology, open quantum systems, and quantum
many-body physics. At a fundamental level, theoretical quantum thermometry is
concerned with finding the ultimate bounds and scaling laws that limit the
precision of temperature estimation for systems in and out-of-thermal
equilibrium. At a more practical level, it provides tools to formulate precise,
yet feasible, thermometric protocols for relevant experimental architectures.
Last but not least, the theory of quantum thermometry examines genuine quantum
features, like entanglement and coherence, for their exploitation in
enhanced-resolution thermometry.

operator norm of the band-limitation operator followed by the time-limitation
operator, generalize this theory to arbitrary pairs of operators, and then
develop -- out of this generalization -- the coherence-based uncertainty
relations due to Elad and Bruckstein, 2002, as well as uncertainty relations in
terms of concentration of $1$-norm or $2$-norm. The theory is completed with
the recently discovered set-theoretic uncertainty relations which lead to best
possible recovery thresholds in terms of a general measure of parsimony, namely
Minkowski dimension. We also elaborate on the remarkable connection between
uncertainty relations and the ""large sieve"", a family of inequalities developed
in analytic number theory. It is finally shown how uncertainty relations allow
to establish fundamental limits of practical signal recovery problems such as
inpainting, declipping, super-resolution, and denoising of signals corrupted by
impulse noise or narrowband interference. Detailed proofs are provided

their classical analogs. The origin of such advantages lies in the role of
quantum correlations, which may arise during the charging and discharging
processes performed on the battery. In this theoretical work, we introduce a
systematic characterization of the relevant quantities of quantum batteries,
i.e., the capacity and the power, in relation to such correlations. For these
quantities, we derive upper bounds for batteries that are a collection of
noninteracting quantum cells with fixed Hamiltonians. The capacity, that is, a
bound on the stored or extractable energy, is derived with the help of the
energy-entropy diagram, and this bound is respected as long as the charging and
discharging processes are entropy preserving. While studying power, we consider
a geometric approach for the evolution of the battery state in the energy
eigenspace of the battery Hamiltonian. Then, an upper bound for power is
derived for arbitrary charging process, in terms of the Fisher information and
the energy variance of the battery. The former quantifies the speed of
evolution, and the latter encodes the nonlocal character of the battery state.
Indeed, due to the fact that the energy variance is bounded by the multipartite
entanglement properties of batteries composed of qubits, we establish a
fundamental bound on power imposed by quantum entanglement. We also discuss
paradigmatic models for batteries that saturate the bounds both for the stored
energy and power. Several experimentally realizable quantum batteries, based on
integrable spin chains, the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick and the Dicke models, are also
studied in the light of these newly introduced bounds.

process that relies on a partly known state-space model of the system and
regards the unknown dynamics as an additive bounded disturbance. We introduce a
framework for safely learning a control strategy for a given system with an
additive disturbance. On the basis of the known part of the model, a safe set
in which the system can learn safely, the algorithm can choose optimal actions
for pursuing the target set as long as the safety-preserving condition is
satisfied. After some learning episodes, the disturbance can be updated based
on real-world data. To this end, Gaussian Process regression is conducted on
the collected disturbance samples. Since the unstable nature of the law of the
real world, for example, change of friction or conductivity with the
temperature, we expect to have the more robust solution of optimal control

  For evaluation of approach described above we choose an inverted pendulum as
a benchmark model. The proposed algorithm manages to learn a policy that does
not violate the pre-specified safety constraints. Observed performance is
improved when it was incorporated exploration set up to make sure that an

one that allows both randomness and non-determinism. Presently we do not have
any super-logarithmic lower bound for the AM-complexity of an explicit
function. Obtaining such a bound is a fundamental challenge to our
understanding of communication phenomena. In this article we explore the gap
between the known techniques and the complexity class AM.
  In the first part we define a new natural class, Small-advantage Layered
Arthur-Merlin (SLAM), that has the following properties:
  - SLAM is (strictly) included in AM and includes all previously known
subclasses of AM with non-trivial lower bounds.
  - SLAM is qualitatively stronger than the union of those classes.
  - SLAM is a subject to the discrepancy bound: in particular, the inner
product function does not have an efficient SLAM-protocol.
  Structurally this can be summarised as
  SBP $\cup$ UAM $\subset$ SLAM $\subseteq$ AM $\cap$ PP.
  In the second part we ask why proving a lower bound of $\omega(\sqrt n)$ on
the MA-complexity of an explicit function seems to be difficult.
  Both of these results are related to the notion of layer complexity, which
is, informally, the number of ""layers of non-determinism"" used by a protocol.

electron microscopy. In addition to image formation, the energetic electrons
may also cause damage while impinging on the sample. In a good conductor such
as graphene the damage is limited to the knock-on process caused by elastic
electron-nucleus collisions. This process is determined by the kinetic energy
an atom needs to be sputtered, ie, its displacement threshold energy. This is
typically assumed to have a fixed value for all electron impacts on equivalent
atoms within a crystal. Here we show using density functional tight-binding
simulations that the displacement threshold energy is affected by the thermal
perturbation of the atoms from their equilibrium positions. We show that this
can be accounted for in the estimation of the displacement cross section by
replacing the constant threshold value with a distribution. The improved model
better describes previous precision measurements of graphene knock-on damage,
and should be considered also for other low-dimensional materials.

help to further understand how cosmic-ray electrons (CRe) propagate through the
interstellar medium into the halo and how this is affected by energy losses and
magnetic fields. Observations with the Very Large Array (VLA) from Continuum
Haloes in Nearby Galaxies - an EVLA Survey (CHANG-ES) are combined with those
with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS
) to identify the prevailing mode of cosmic-ray transport in the edge-on spiral
galaxy NGC 3556. We mapped the radio spectral index, magnetic field strength,
and orientation using VLA 1.5 and 6 GHz and LOFAR 144 MHz data, and we fit 1D
cosmic-ray propagation models to these maps using Spinnaker (Spectral Index
Numerical Analysis of K(c)osmic-ray electron radio emission) and its
interactive wrapper Spinteractive. We find that the spectral index in the
galactic midplane is, as expected for young CRe, alpha ~ -0.7 and steepens
towards the halo of the galaxy as a consequence of spectral ageing. The
intensity scale heights are about 1.4 and 1.9 kpc for the thin disc, and 3.3
and 5.9 kpc for the thick disc at 1.5 GHz and 144 MHz, respectively. While pure
diffusion cannot explain our data, advection can, particularly if we assume a
linearly accelerating wind. Our best-fitting model has an initial speed of 123
km s^-1 in the galactic midplane and reaches the escape velocity at heights
between 5 kpc and 15 kpc above the disc, depending on the assumed dark matter
halo of the galaxy. This galactic wind scenario is corroborated by the
existence of vertical filaments seen both in the radio continuum and in H alpha
in the disc-halo interface and of a large-scale reservoir of hot, X-ray
emitting gas in the halo. Radio haloes show the existence of galactic winds,
possibly driven by cosmic rays, in typical star-forming spiral galaxies.

flares with a fleet of nine ground-based telescopes simultaneously, which
provided broadband photometry and low-resolution spectra at the Balmer jump. A
broadband continuum increase occurred with a signal-to-noise > 20 in the HST

smaller flux enhancements compared to the continuum radiation. These two events
produced the most prominent Balmer line radiation and the largest Balmer jumps

put forth an adversarial inference procedure for training them on data, while
constraining their predictions to satisfy given physical laws expressed by
partial differential equations. Such physics-informed constraints provide a
regularization mechanism for effectively training deep generative models as
surrogates of physical systems in which the cost of data acquisition is high,
and training data-sets are typically small. This provides a flexible framework
for characterizing uncertainty in the outputs of physical systems due to
randomness in their inputs or noise in their observations that entirely
bypasses the need for repeatedly sampling expensive experiments or numerical
simulators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a series
of examples involving uncertainty propagation in non-linear conservation laws,

at explaining our individual ways of interpretation, an intention that has been
of fundamental importance to the social sciences from the beginning. More
recently, advances in computer science brought up two related questions: First,
can computational tools be adopted for analyzing ways of interpretation?
Second, what if the ""beholder"" is a computer model, i.e., how can we explain a

of these points, while many existing approaches focus on particular aspects and
are still rather separate. With this paper, in order to connect these
approaches we introduce a theoretical framework for analyzing interpretation,
which is applicable to interpretation of both human beings and computer models.
We give an overview of relevant computational approaches from various fields,

paper lies on interpretation of text and image data, while many of the
presented approaches are applicable to other types of data as well.

U(1)_B arises accidentally due to the SU(3)_C color gauge symmetry, and it
protects the proton from a decay at a sufficient level. Likewise, if there is
an SU(N) gauge symmetry in the hidden sector, an accidental hidden baryon
number symmetry U(1)_{B_H} can appear. The hidden baryon number is solely
obtained by the structure of the SU(N) group. In particular, the quality of the
U(1)_{B_H} can be arbitrarily good for an asymptotically-free theory with large
enough N. The U(1)_{B_H} can be identified as a PQ symmetry. Using our
findings, we build two types of novel composite axion models: a model where
only one SU(N) gauge symmetry is required to both guarantee the quality and
break the U(1)_{B_H}, and a model with SU(N)xSU(M) gauge symmetry where the
exotic quarks responsible to the axion-gluon coupling do not confine into

interacting Luttinger model with $j\!=\!3/2$ electrons, we investigate the
dominant superconducting channels for a multi-orbital quadratic band-touching
system with finite chemical potential, which breaks the particle-hole symmetry
in the normal state. Notably, while the system generally favors d-wave pairing,
the absence of the particle-hole symmetry necessarily induces parasitic s-wave
pairing. Based on the Landau theory with $SO(3)$ symmetry, we demonstrate that
two kinds of topological superconductors are energetically favored; uniaxial
nematic phase with parasitic $s$ wave pairing ($d_{(3z^2-r^2)}\!+\!s$) and
time-reversal-symmetry broken phase with parasitic $s$ wave pairing
($d_{(3z^2-r^2,xy)}\!+\!id_{x^2-y^2}\!+\!s$). These superconductors contain
either nodal lines or Fermi pockets of gapless Bogoliubov quasiparticles and
moreover exhibit topological winding numbers $\pm2$, leading to non-trivial
surface states such as drumhead-like surface states or Fermi arcs. We discuss
applications of our theory to relevant families of materials, especially

Lindblad master equation together with a continuity equation, another approach

us to show the consistency of both approaches, and, in the latter expression
derived from the Lindblad equation, it allows us to split the energy, which
comes from the baths to the system, into heat and work. The recognition of work
in the process, that is recurrently ignored in studies of transport, enables us
to understand thermodynamical aspects and to solve some imbroglios in the

setting. For example, in the standard closeness testing problem, Alice and Bob
each have $t$ samples from, respectively, distributions $a$ and $b$ over $[n]$,
and they need to test whether $a=b$ or $a,b$ are $\epsilon$-far for some fixed
$\epsilon>0$. This is in contrast to the well-studied one-party case, where the
tester has unrestricted access to samples of both distributions, for which
optimal bounds are known for a number of variations. Despite being a natural
constraint in applications, the two-party setting has evaded attention so far.
  We address two fundamental aspects: 1) what is the communication complexity,
and 2) can it be accomplished securely, without Alice and Bob learning extra
information about each other's input. Besides closeness testing, we also study
the independence testing problem, where Alice and Bob have $t$ samples from
distributions $a$ and $b$ respectively, which may be correlated; the question
is whether $a,b$ are independent of $\epsilon$-far from being independent.
  Our contribution is three-fold:
  1) Communication: we show how to gain communication efficiency with more
samples, beyond the information-theoretic bound on $t$. The gain is
polynomially better than what one obtains by adapting standard algorithms.
  2) Lower bounds: we prove tightness of our protocols for the closeness
testing, and for the independence testing when the number of samples is
unbounded. These lower bounds are of independent interest as these are the
first 2-party communication lower bounds for testing problems.
  3) Security: we define secure distribution testing and argue that it must
leak at least some minimal information. We then provide secure versions of the
above protocols with an overhead that is only polynomial in the security
parameter.

been discovered using spatially resolved optical spectroscopy from the ongoing
SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. These galaxies, termed ""red geysers"", constitute $5-10\%$
of the local quiescent population and are characterized by narrow bisymmetric
patterns in ionized gas emission features. Cheung et al. argued that these
galaxies host large-scale AGN-driven winds that may play a role in suppressing
star formation at late times. In this work, we test the hypothesis that AGN
activity is ultimately responsible for the red geyser phenomenon. We compare
the nuclear radio activity of the red geysers to a matched control sample with
similar stellar mass, redshift, rest frame $NUV-r$ color, axis ratio and
presence of ionized gas. We have used the 1.4 GHz radio continuum data from VLA
FIRST survey to stack the radio flux from the red geyser and control samples.
In addition to a 3 times higher FIRST detection rate, we find that red geysers
have a 5$\sigma$ higher level of average radio flux than control galaxies.
After restricting to rest-frame $NUV-r$ color $>$ 5 and checking mid-IR WISE
photometry, we rule out star formation contamination and conclude that red
geysers are associated with more active AGN. Red geysers and a possibly-related
class with disturbed H$\alpha$ emission account for 40\% of all radio-detected
red galaxies with $\rm log~(M_\star/M_\odot) < 11$. Our results support a

maps on manifolds and its application to geometric theory of manifolds is one
of important branches of geometry and mathematics. Studies related to this was
started in 1950s by differential topologists such as Thom and Whitney and they
have been studied actively.
  In this paper, we study fold maps obtained by surgery operations to
fundamental fold maps, and especially Reeb spaces, defined as the spaces of all
connected components of preimages and in suitable situations inheriting
fundamental and important algebraic invariants such as (co)homology groups.
Reeb spaces are fundamental and important tools in studying manifolds also in
general. The author has already studied about homology groups of the Reeb
spaces and obtained several results and in this paper, we study about their
cohomology rings for several specific cases, as more precise information. These
studies are motivated by a problem that construction of explicit fold maps is
important in investigating (the worlds of explicit classes of) manifolds in
geometric and constructive ways and difficult. It is not so difficult to
construct these maps for simplest manifolds such as standard spheres, products
of standard spheres and manifolds represented as their connected sums. We see
various types of cohomology rings of Reeb spaces via systematic construction of
fold maps.

cosmic branes inserted into the bulk spacetime. They differ between a
microcanonical and a canonical ensemble because the two ensembles provide
different boundary conditions for the gravitational theory under which cosmic

$\sim2.9$ kpc at its distance of 130 kpc. While similar in spatial extent to
the Large Magellanic Cloud, Antlia 2 is orders of magnitude fainter at $M_V=-9$
mag, making it by far the lowest surface brightness system known (at $\sim31.9$
mag/arcsec$^2$), $\sim100$ times more diffuse than the so-called ultra diffuse
galaxies. The satellite was identified using a combination of astrometry,
photometry and variability data from \textit{Gaia} Data Release 2, and its
nature confirmed with deep archival DECam imaging, which revealed a conspicuous
BHB signal. We have also obtained follow-up spectroscopy using AAOmega on the
AAT, identifying 159 member stars, and we used them to measure the dwarf's
systemic velocity, $290.9\pm0.5$km/s, its velocity dispersion, $5.7\pm1.1$
km/s, and mean metallicity, [Fe/H]$=-1.4$. From these properties we conclude
that Antlia 2 inhabits one of the least dense Dark Matter (DM) halos probed to
date. Dynamical modelling and tidal-disruption simulations suggest that a
combination of a cored DM profile and strong tidal stripping may explain the
observed properties of this satellite. The origin of this core may be
consistent with aggressive feedback, or may even require alternatives to cold
dark matter (such as ultra-light bosons).

be $z_0 = 0.4 \pm 0.1$ kpc. We calculate a Galactic DNS merger rate of
$\mathcal{R}_{\rm MW} = 42^{+30}_{-14}$ Myr$^{-1}$ at the 90% confidence level.
The corresponding DNS merger detection rate for Advanced LIGO is
$\mathcal{R}_{\rm LIGO} = 0.18^{+0.13}_{-0.06} \times \left( D_{\rm r}/100 \

formation region is within the hydrogen-rich envelope of the exploding star.
Optical spectra taken within a few days of the SN explosion, when the
photosphere is hot, show features of ionised carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, as
well as hydrogen and helium. Quantitative analysis of this very early phase may
therefore constrain the chemical abundances of the stellar envelope at the
point of core-collapse. Using existing and new evolutionary calculations for
Red Supergiants (RSGs), we show that the predictions for the terminal surface
[C/N] ratio is correlated with the initial mass of the progenitor star.
Specifically, a star with an initial mass above 20M$_{\odot}$ exploding in the
RSG phase should have an unequivocal signal of a low [C/N] abundance.
Furthermore, we show that the model predictions are relatively insensitive to
uncertainties in the treatment of convective mixing. Although there is a
dependence on initial rotation, this can be dealt with in a probabilistic sense
by convolving the model predictions with the observed distribution of stellar
rotation rates. Using numerical experiments, we present a strategy for using
very early-time spectroscopy to determine the upper limit to the progenitor

the end of inflation, and $ii)$ the post-inflationary equation of state becomes
sufficiently stiff $w \geq w_{\rm RD}\gtrsim 0.57$, with $w_{\rm RD}$ a

expected shear flow profile for a Newtonian fluid developed, consistent with
the fluid viscosities. However, unexpected secondary flows along the shear
gradient formed when the simulation box was elongated in the flow direction.
The standard shear flow profile was obtained when the simulation box was longer
in the shear-gradient dimension than the flow dimension, while the secondary
flows were always present when the flow dimension was at least 25% larger than
the shear-gradient dimension. The secondary flows satisfy the boundary
conditions imposed by the RNES and have a lower rate of viscous dissipation in
the fluid than the corresponding unidirectional flows. This work highlights a
previously unappreciated limitation of RNES for generating shear flow in
simulation boxes that are elongated in the flow dimension, an important
consideration when applying RNES to complex fluids like polymer solutions.

to as Beer-Lambert's law. Knowledge of the material-specific attenuation
coefficient $\mu$ allows to determine the thickness of a sample from the
intensity decrease the beam has experienced. However, classical X-ray tubes
emit a polychromatic bremsstrahlung-spectrum. And the attenuation coefficients
of all materials depend on the photon energy: photons with high energy are
attenuated less than photons with low energy. In consequence, the X-ray

that the probability to find the atom in the excited state tends to zero. In
this paper it will be shown that the mathematical model in single-photon

Namely, the probability to find the atom in the excited state may tend to a
nonzero constant so that the atom is not in the pure state finally. This effect
is due to that the spectrum of the complete hamiltonian is not purely
absolutely continuous and has a discrete level outside the continuous part.
Namely, we state that in the corresponding invariant subspace, determining the
time evolution, the spectrum of the complete hamiltonian when the field is
considered in three dimensions may be not purely absolutely continuous and may
have an eigenvalue. The appearance of eigenvalue has a threshold character. If
the field is considered in two dimensions the spectrum always has an eigenvalue
and the decay is absent.

characteristics. The model also includes the effect of Schottky-type
source/drain contact resistances, which are voltage-dependent and can
significantly limit current conduction in the on-state in BP FETs. Model
parameters are extracted using measured data of back-gated BP transistors with
gate lengths of 1000 nm and 300 nm with BP thickness of 7.3 nm and 8.1 nm, and
for the temperature range of 180 K to 298 K. Compared to previous BP models
that are validated only for room-temperature and near-equilibrium bias
conditions (low drain-source voltage), we demonstrate excellent agreement
between the data and model over a broad range of bias and temperature values.
The model is also validated against numerical TCAD data of top-gated BP
transistors with a channel length of 300 nm. The model is implemented in
Verilog-A and the capability of the model to handle both dc and transient
circuit simulations is demonstrated using SPECTRE. The model not only provides
a physical insight into technology-device interaction in BP transistors, but
can also be used to design and optimize BP-based circuits using a standard

Lattice QCD studies of (coupled-channel) meson-meson scattering aimed at the
determination of scattering amplitudes and resonance pole positions. A wealth
of information for this purpose can be obtained from the lattice spectra in
frames with nonzero total momentum. These are particularly dense since hadrons
with different $J^P$ contribute to any given lattice irreducible
representation. This is because $J^P$ is not a good quantum number in flight,
and also because the continuum symmetry is reduced on the lattice. In this
paper we address the assignment of the underlying continuum $J^P$ quantum
numbers to charmonia in flight using a $N_f = 2 + 1$ CLS ensemble. As a first
step, we apply the single-hadron approach, where only interpolating fields of
quark-antiquark type are used. The approach follows techniques previously
applied to the light meson spectrum by the Hadron Spectrum Collaboration. The
resulting spectra of charmonia with assigned $J^P$ will provide valuable
information for the parameterization of (resonant) amplitudes in future
determinations of resonance properties with lattice QCD.

that individuals' interactions repeated within a local neighborhood support the
evolution of cooperation--has been confirmed in several theoretical models.
Essentially, local interactions allow cooperators to stay protected from
exploiters by assorting into clusters, and the heterogeneity of the network of
contacts--the co-presence of low- and high-connected nodes--has been shown to
further favor cooperation. The few available large-scale experiments on humans
have however missed these effects. The reason is that, while models assume that
individuals update strategy by imitating better performing neighbors,
experiments showed that humans are more prone to reciprocate cooperation than
to compare payoffs. Inspired by the empirical results, we rethink network
reciprocity as a rational form of direct reciprocity on networks--networked
rational reciprocity--indeed made possible by the locality of interactions. We
show that reciprocal altruism in a networked prisoner's dilemma can invade and
fixate in any network of rational agents, profit-maximizing over an horizon of
future interactions. We find that networked rational reciprocity works better
at low average connectivity and we unveil the role of network heterogeneity.
Only if cooperating hubs invest in the initial cost of exploitation, the
invasion of cooperation is boosted; it is otherwise hindered. Although humans
might not be as rational as here assumed, our results could help the design and
interpretation of new experiments in social and economic networks

\text{div} f(z)$ is mean-zero for functions $f$ with integrable gradient. Here,
$\text{div} f$ is the divergence of the function $f$ and $z$ is a standard

characterize the variance of such random variables for all functions $f(z)$
with square integrable gradient, and to demonstrate the usefulness of this
formula in various applications.
  In the Gaussian sequence model, a consequence of Stein's formula is Stein's
Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE), an unbiased estimate of the mean squared risk
for almost any estimator $\hat\mu$ of the unknown mean. A first application of
the Second Order Stein formula is an Unbiased Risk Estimate for SURE itself
(SURE for SURE): an unbiased estimate {providing} information about the squared
distance between SURE and the squared estimation error of $\hat\mu$. SURE for
SURE has a simple form as a function of the data and is applicable to all
$\hat\mu$ with square integrable gradient, e.g. the Lasso and the Elastic Net.
  In addition to SURE for SURE, the following applications are developed: (1)
Upper bounds on the risk of SURE when the estimation target is the mean squared
error; (2) Confidence regions based on SURE; (3) Oracle inequalities satisfied
by SURE-tuned estimates; (4) An upper bound on the variance of the size of the
model selected by the Lasso; (5) Explicit expressions of SURE for SURE for the

Ireland's relatively small, isolated network presents an opportunity to model a

possible. A complete model of the Irish 400, 275, 220 and 110 kV network was
made for GIC calculations, with detailed information on the number, type and DC
resistances of transformers. The measured grounding resistances at a number of
substations were also included in the model, which represents a considerable
improvement on previous models of the Irish power network for GIC calculations.
Sensitivity tests were performed to show how calculated GIC amplitudes are
affected by different aspects of the model. These tests investigated: (1) How
the orientation of a uniform electric field affects GICs. (2) The effect of
including/omitting lower-voltage elements of the power network. (3) How the
substation grounding resistances assumptions affected GIC values. It was found
that changing the grounding resistance value had a considerable effect on
calculated GICs at some substations, and no discernible effect at others.

the most existing methods, which simply compute representations of video clips
using frame-level aggregation (e.g. average pooling), the proposed STA adopts a
more effective way for producing robust clip-level feature representation.
Concretely, our STA fully exploits those discriminative parts of one target
person in both spatial and temporal dimensions, which results in a 2-D
attention score matrix via inter-frame regularization to measure the
importances of spatial parts across different frames. Thus, a more robust
clip-level feature representation can be generated according to a weighted sum
operation guided by the mined 2-D attention score matrix. In this way, the
challenging cases for video-based person re-identification such as pose
variation and partial occlusion can be well tackled by the STA. We conduct
extensive experiments on two large-scale benchmarks, i.e. MARS and
DukeMTMC-VideoReID. In particular, the mAP reaches 87.7% on MARS, which
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts with a large margin of more

inferences from knowledge expressed in such standards, is traditionally based
on logical deductive methods and algorithms which can be proven to be sound and
complete and terminating, i.e. correct in a very strong sense. For various
reasons, though, in particular, the scalability issues arising from the
ever-increasing amounts of Semantic Web data available and the inability of
deductive algorithms to deal with noise in the data, it has been argued that
alternative means of reasoning should be investigated which bear high promise

equations or systems involving kernel matrices, the main challenges are the
expensive matrix-vector multiplication and the storage cost which are usually
tackled by hierarchical matrix techniques such as $\mathcal{H}$ and
$\mathcal{H}^2$ matrices. However, hierarchical matrices also have a high
construction cost that is dominated by the low-rank approximations of the
sub-blocks of the kernel matrix. In this paper, an efficient method is proposed
to give a low-rank approximation of the kernel matrix block $K(X_0, Y_0)$ in
the form of an interpolative decomposition (ID) for a kernel function $K(x,y)$
and two properly located point sets $X_0, Y_0$. The proposed method combines
the ID using strong rank-revealing QR (sRRQR), which is purely algebraic, with
analytic kernel information to reduce the construction cost of a rank-$r$
approximation from $O(r|X_0||Y_0|)$, for ID using sRRQR alone, to $O(r|X_0|)$
which is not related to $|Y_0|$. Numerical experiments show that
$\mathcal{H}^2$ matrix construction with the proposed algorithm only requires a
computational cost linear in the matrix dimension.

present-day coherent imaging technologies. Often in such imaging techniques,
the acquired images, known as interferograms, suffer from two major
degradations: 1) phase wrapping caused by the fact that the sensing mechanism
can only measure sinusoidal $2\pi$-periodic functions of the actual phase, and
2) noise introduced by the acquisition process or the system. This work
focusses on InPhase denoising which is a fundamental restoration step to many
posterior applications of InPhase, namely to phase unwrapping. The presence of
sharp fringes that arises from phase wrapping makes InPhase denoising a
hard-inverse problem. Motivated by the fact that the InPhase images are often
locally sparse in Fourier domain, we propose a multi-resolution windowed
Fourier filtering (WFF) analysis that fuses WFF estimates with different
resolutions, thus overcoming the WFF fixed resolution limitation. The proposed
fusion relies on an unbiased estimate of the mean square error derived using
the Stein's lemma adapted to complex-valued signals. This estimate, known as
SURE, is minimized using an optimization framework to obtain the fusion
weights. Strong experimental evidence, using synthetic and real (InSAR & MRI)
data, that the developed algorithm, termed as SURE-fuse WFF, outperforms the
best hand-tuned fixed resolution WFF as well as other state-of-the-art InPhase
denoising algorithms, is provided.

with the ever-increasing mobile data traffic because of its large bandwidth. To
enable a sufficient link margin, a large antenna array employing directional
beamforming, which is enabled by the availability of channel state information
at the transmitter (CSIT), is required. However, CSIT acquisition for mmWave
channels introduces a huge feedback overhead due to the typically large number
of transmit and receive antennas. Leveraging properties of mmWave channels,
this paper proposes a precoding strategy which enables a flexible adjustment of
the feedback overhead. In particular, the optimal unconstrained precoder is
approximated by selecting a variable number of elements from a basis that is
constructed as a function of the transmitter array response, where the number
of selected basis elements can be chosen according to the feedback constraint.
Simulation results show that the proposed precoding scheme can provide a
near-optimal solution if a higher feedback overhead can be afforded. For a low
overhead, it can still provide a good approximation of the optimal precoder.

of sequential data problems. A well known difficulty in using RNNs is the
\textit{vanishing or exploding gradient} problem. Recently, there have been
several different RNN architectures that try to mitigate this issue by
maintaining an orthogonal or unitary recurrent weight matrix. One such
architecture is the scaled Cayley orthogonal recurrent neural network (scoRNN)
which parameterizes the orthogonal recurrent weight matrix through a scaled
Cayley transform. This parametrization contains a diagonal scaling matrix
consisting of positive or negative one entries that can not be optimized by
gradient descent. Thus the scaling matrix is fixed before training and a
hyperparameter is introduced to tune the matrix for each particular task. In
this paper, we develop a unitary RNN architecture based on a complex scaled
Cayley transform. Unlike the real orthogonal case, the transformation uses a
diagonal scaling matrix consisting of entries on the complex unit circle which
can be optimized using gradient descent and no longer requires the tuning of a
hyperparameter. We also provide an analysis of a potential issue of the modReLU
activiation function which is used in our work and several other unitary RNNs.
In the experiments conducted, the scaled Cayley unitary recurrent neural
network (scuRNN) achieves comparable or better results than scoRNN and other
unitary RNNs without fixing the scaling matrix.

electromagnetic sources with reconfigurable operation in a broad frequency
range. Photoexcited graphene can act as the gain medium to produce coherent
radiation at low THz frequencies but its response is very weak due to its
ultrathin thickness. In this work, we demonstrate an alternative design to
achieve efficient tunable and compact THz amplifiers and lasers with broadband
operation based on active THz hyperbolic metamaterials (HMM) designed by
multiple stacked photoexcited graphene layers separated by thin dielectric

analytically and numerically studied and characterized. When the graphene-based
HMM structure is periodically patterned, a broadband slow-wave propagation
regime is identified, thanks to the hyperbolic dispersion. In this scenario,
reconfigurable amplification of THz waves in a broad frequency range is
obtained, which can be made tunable by varying the quasi-Fermi level of
graphene. We demonstrate that the THz response of the presented tunable THz
amplifiers or lasers is controlled by the incident optical pumping

an interesting property that can have great potential for THz amplification,

characteristics of the underlying data. This has led to a number of count
estimation procedures which work well in one scenario but perform poorly in
others. A practitioner is faced with two basic, unanswered questions. Which
variant should be chosen when the data is unknown? Given an estimate, is its
error sufficiently small to be trustworthy?
  We provide answers to these questions. We derive new count estimators,
including a provably optimal estimator, which best or match previous estimators
in all scenarios. We also provide practical, tight error bounds at query time
for both new and existing estimators. These error estimates also yield
procedures to choose the sketch tuning parameters optimally, as they can
extrapolate the error to different choices of sketch width and depth.
  The key observation is that the distribution of errors in each counter can be
empirically estimated from the sketch itself. By first estimating this
distribution, count estimation becomes a statistical estimation and inference
problem with a known error distribution. This provides both a principled way to
derive new and optimal estimators as well as a way to study the error and

very informational non-clicked examples by adversarial sampling and training.
Experiments are performed on benchmark data sets for common ad-hoc retrieval

large, sparsely instrumented particle detectors such as IceCube and Antares is
a critical outstanding problem in particle physics. When the detector is
sparsely instrumented, ray tracing is inefficient, as nearly all of these rays
are either lost in the bulk of the detector due to absorption or simply fail to
end on a detector. Particle astrophysics experiments face a similar problem
when they simulate cosmic ray muon fluxes in their detectors. Many fields of
science face calculations that involve constrained initial and final states,
with stochastic processes between. Taking the case of ray-tracing of light as
our example, this paper describes a new and highly computationally efficient
approach to the problem. By specifying the problem as a path integral, the
final state of these rays can be constrained to land on a light sensitive

Jump Markov Chain Monte-Carlo, yielding performance improvements of up to 1,000

equivalent masses and SF processes during the encounter. Using scanning
Fabry-Perot interferometry, we studied the contribution of circular and
non-circular motions and the response of the ionized gas to external
perturbations. We compared the kinematics with direct images of the pair and
traced the SF processes and gravitational effects due to the presence of the
other galaxy. The SED of each member of the pair was fitted. A mass model was
fitted to the rotation curve of each galaxy. Large, non-circular motions
detected in both galaxies are associated with a bar, spiral arms, and HII
regions for the inner parts of the galaxies, and with the tidal interaction for
the outer parts of the discs. Bifurcations in the rotation curves indicate that
the galaxies have recently undergone their pericentric passage. The pattern
speed of a perturbation of one of the galaxies is computed. Location of a
possible corotation seems to indicate that the gravitational response of the
ionized gas in the outer parts of the disc is related to the regions where
ongoing SF is confined. The SED fit indicates a slightly different star

takes 5 - 24 hours to run depending on the processing cluster architecture. We
apply more heuristic, biologically driven genetic algorithms (GAs) to limit the
exploration of the total parameter space, tune all four kernels together and
reduce the tuning time to few hours. Our results show that after only few hours
of tuning, GAs always find similar or even better configurations for all
kernels together than the combination of single kernel configurations tuned by
the BF approach. At the same time, by means of their genetic operators, GAs
converge into better solutions than those obtained by pure random searches. The

impact of a treatment on a single unit in panel data settings. The ""synthetic
control"" is a weighted average of control units that balances the treated
unit's pre-treatment outcomes as closely as possible. A critical feature of the
original proposal is to use SCM only when the fit on pre-treatment outcomes is
excellent. We propose Augmented SCM as an extension of SCM to settings where
such pre-treatment fit is infeasible. Analogous to bias correction for inexact
matching, Augmented SCM uses an outcome model to estimate the bias due to
imperfect pre-treatment fit and then de-biases the original SCM estimate. Our
main proposal, which uses ridge regression as the outcome model, directly
controls pre-treatment fit while minimizing extrapolation from the convex hull.
This estimator can also be expressed as a solution to a modified synthetic
controls problem that allows negative weights on some donor units. We bound the
estimation error of this approach under different data generating processes,
including a linear factor model, and show how regularization helps to avoid
over-fitting to noise. We demonstrate gains from Augmented SCM with extensive

Walsh spectra functions (taking the values from the set $\{0, \pm 2^{\lceil
\frac{n+s}{2} \rceil}\}$), has been commonly approached by specifying a
suitable algebraic normal form which then induces this particular Walsh
spectral characterization. In this article, we consider the reversed design
method which specifies these functions in the spectral domain by specifying a
suitable allocation of the nonzero spectral values and their signs. We analyze
the properties of trivial and nontrivial plateaued functions (as affine
inequivalent distinct subclasses), which are distinguished by their Walsh
support $S_f$ (the subset of $GF(2)^n$ having the nonzero spectral values) in
terms of whether it is an affine subspace or not. The former class exactly
corresponds to partially bent functions and admits linear structures, whereas
the latter class may contain functions without linear structures. A simple
sufficient condition on $S_f$, which ensures the nonexistence of linear
structures, is derived and some generic design methods of nontrivial plateaued
functions without linear structures are given. The extended affine equivalence
of plateaued functions is also addressed using the concept of dual of plateaued
functions. Furthermore, we solve the problem of specifying disjoint spectra
(non)trivial plateaued functions of maximal cardinality whose concatenation can
be used to construct bent functions in a generic manner. This approach may lead
to new classes of bent functions due to large variety of possibilities to
select underlying duals that define these disjoint spectra plateaued functions.
An additional method of specifying affine inequivalent plateaued functions,
obtained by applying a nonlinear transform to their input domain, is also
given.

proposed, however, evaluating GANs performance is inherently difficult because
current methods for measuring the quality of their output are not always
consistent with what a human perceives. We propose a novel approach that
combines a brain-computer interface (BCI) with GANs to generate a measure we
call Neuroscore, which closely mirrors the behavioral ground truth measured
from participants tasked with discerning real from synthetic images. This
technique we call a neuro-AI interface, as it provides an interface between a
human's neural systems and an AI process. In this paper, we first compare the
three most widely used metrics in the literature for evaluating GANs in terms
of visual quality and compare their outputs with human judgments. Secondly we
propose and demonstrate a novel approach using neural signals and rapid serial
visual presentation (RSVP) that directly measures a human perceptual response
to facial production quality, independent of a behavioral response measurement.
The correlation between our proposed Neuroscore and human perceptual judgments
has Pearson correlation statistics: $\mathrm{r}(48) = -0.767, \mathrm{p} =

line quasars does not completely cover the continuum emission region, and that
partial covering must be accounted for to accurately measure the column density
of the outflowing gas. However, the nature of partial covering itself is not
understood. Extrapolation of the SimBAL spectral synthesis model of the HST COS
UV spectrum from SDSS J0850+4451 reported by Leighly et al. 2018 to
non-simultaneous rest-frame optical and near-infrared spectra reveals evidence
that the covering fraction has wavelength dependence, and is a factor of 2.5
times higher in the UV than in the optical and near-infrared bands. The
difference in covering fraction can be explained if the outflow consists of
clumps that are small and either structured or clustered relative to the
projected size of the UV continuum emission region, and have a more diffuse
distribution on size scales comparable to the near-infrared continuum emission
region size. The lower covering fraction over the larger physical area results
in a reduction of the measured total column density by a factor of 1.6 compared
with the UV-only solution. This experiment demonstrates that we can compare
rest-frame UV and near-infrared absorption lines, specifically HeI*10830, to
place constraints on the uniformity of absorption gas in broad absorbing line

the absorption coefficients of ionic liquids under different electric fields.
Five groups of imidazole ionic liquids were experimentally investigated and an
inversion was performed to determine the spectral absorption coefficients of
the imidazole ionic liquids under electric fields. Different intensities with
multiple interface refractions and reflections were also considered, and the
various measurement errors were analyzed through uncertainties propagation
analysis. Spectral absorption of ionic liquids from 300 nm to 2500 nm was
obtained and the absorption coefficients were retrieved. It was found that the
absorption behavior of ionic liquids changed in some frequency bands under an
applied electric field. The experimental results showed that the absorption
coefficient of the ionic liquid increases with the voltage at 1520nm and
1920nm. The change rate was affected by the types of anions and cations in the
ionic liquid and the diffusion rate of the ions therein. This study provides
illustrations for the ionic liquid-based electro-optical regulation in terms of

  Comments welcome",,"10.3847/1538-4365/aaeffa",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When modeling and interpreting the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of
galaxies, the simple stellar population (SSP) model, star formation history
(SFH) and dust attenuation law (DAL) are three of the most important
components. However, each of them carries significant uncertainties which have
seriously limited our ability to reliably recover the physical properties of
galaxies from the analysis of their SEDs. In this paper, we present a Bayesian
framework to deal with these uncertain components simultaneously. Based on the
Bayesian evidence, a quantitative implement of the principle of Occam's razor,
the method allows a more objective and quantitative discrimination among the
different assumptions about these uncertain components. With a Ks-selected
sample of 5467 low-redshift (mostly with $z\lesssim 1$) galaxies in the
COSMOS/UltraVISTA field and classified into passively evolving galaxies (PEGs)
and star-forming galaxies (SFGs) with UVJ diagram, we present a Bayesian
discrimination of a set of 16 SSP models from five research groups (BC03 and
CB07, M05, GALEV, Yunnan-II, BPASS V2.0), five forms of SFH (Burst, Constant,
Exp-dec, Exp-inc, Delayed-$\tau$), and four kinds of DAL (Calzetti law, MW,
LMC, SMC). We show that the results obtained with the method are either obvious
or understandable in the context of galaxy physics. We conclude that the
Bayesian model comparison method, especially that for a sample of galaxies, is
very useful for discriminating the different assumptions in the SED modeling of
galaxies. The new version of the BayeSED code, which is used in this work, is

dynamic nature of the risk propagation process, it is difficult to quantify the
critical point of a cyber risk explosion. From the perspective of the
dependency network, this paper proposes a method for quantitative evaluation of
the risk propagation threshold of power CPS networks based on the percolation
theory. First, the power CPS network is abstracted as a dual-layered
network-directed unweighted graph according to topology correlation and
coupling logic, and the asymmetrical balls-into-bins allocation method is used
to establish a ""one-to-many"" and ""partially coupled"" non-uniform power CPS
characterization model. Then, considering the directionality between the cyber
layer and the physical layer link, the probability of percolation flow is
introduced to establish the propagation dynamic equations for the internal
coupling relationship of each layer. Finally, the risk propagation threshold is
numerically quantified by defining the survival function of power CPS network
nodes, and the validity of the proposed method is verified by the IEEE 30-bus
system and 150-node Barabsi-Albert model.

  KD-Forest","13 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the explosive growth in the number of pictures taken by smartphones,
organizing and searching pictures has become important tasks. To efficiently
fulfill these tasks, the key enabler is annotating images with proper keywords,
with which keyword-based searching and organizing become available for images.
Currently, smartphones usually synchronize photo albums with cloud storage
platforms, and have their images annotated with the help of cloud computing.
However, the ""offloading-to-cloud"" solution may cause privacy breach, since
photos from smart photos contain various sensitive information. For privacy
protection, existing research made effort to support cloud-based image
annotation on encrypted images by utilizing cryptographic primitives.
Nevertheless, for each annotation, it requires the cloud to perform linear
checking on the large-scale encrypted dataset with high computational cost.
This paper proposes a cloud-assisted privacy-preserving image annotation with
randomized kd-forest, namely CPAR. With CPAR, users are able to automatically
assign keywords to their images by leveraging the power of cloud with privacy
protected. CPAR proposes a novel privacy-preserving randomized kd-forest
structure, which significantly improves the annotation performance compared
with existing research. Thorough analysis is carried out to demonstrate the
security of CPAR. Experimental evaluation on the well-known IAPR TC-12 dataset
validates the efficiency and effectiveness of CPAR.

Auto-Encoder (ATNNFAE) for byte-level text generation. An ATNNFAE consists of
an auto-encoder where the internal code is normalized on the unit sphere and
corrupted by additive noise. Simultaneously, a replica of the decoder (sharing
the same parameters as the AE decoder) is used as the generator and fed with
random latent vectors. An adversarial discriminator is trained to distinguish
training samples reconstructed from the AE from samples produced through the
random-input generator, making the entire generator-discriminator path
differentiable for discrete data like text. The combined effect of noise
injection in the code and shared weights between the decoder and the generator
can prevent the mode collapsing phenomenon commonly observed in GANs. Since
perplexity cannot be applied to non-sequential text generation, we propose a
new evaluation method using the total variance distance between frequencies of
hash-coded byte-level n-grams (NGTVD). NGTVD is a single benchmark that can
characterize both the quality and the diversity of the generated texts.
Experiments are offered in 6 large-scale datasets in Arabic, Chinese and
English, with comparisons against n-gram baselines and recurrent neural
networks (RNNs). Ablation study on both the noise level and the discriminator
is performed. We find that RNNs have trouble competing with the n-gram
baselines, and the ATNNFAE results are generally competitive.

theoretically that adding (or removing) electrons to systems with Fermi surface
nesting also stabilizes the half-metallic states even in the weak-coupling
regime. In the absence of doping, the ground state of the system is a spin or
charge density wave, formed by four nested bands. Each of these bands is
characterized by charge (electron/hole) and spin (up/down) labels. Only two of
these bands accumulate charge carriers introduced by doping, forming a
half-metallic two-valley Fermi surface. Analysis demonstrates that two types of
such half-metallicity can be stabilized. The first type corresponds to the full
spin polarization of the electrons and holes at the Fermi surface. The second
type, with antiparallel spins in electron-like and hole-like valleys, is
referred to as a ""spin-valley half-metal"" and corresponds to the complete
polarization with respect to the spin-valley operator. We analyze spin and
spin-valley currents and possible superconductivity in these systems. We show
that spin or spin-valley currents can flow in both half-metallic phases.

the two objectives are addressed in separate dimensions. A hybrid algorithm

uses deterministic battery control is developed accordingly. The proposed
approach can avoid some drawbacks faced by conventional weighted-sum methods
for multiobjective optimization: the combination of objectives in different

misrepresentation of user preference. In contrast with existing studies on
residential user privacy that assume limited controllability of appliances to
facilitate algorithm development, this approach addresses the use of flexible

maintain a reasonable energy cost while robustly preserving user privacy at a
sensible level; its convergence rate is comparable to existing multiobjective
evolutionary algorithms while the proposed approach yields a better level of

relatively small scales in the presence of the so-called fast flavor conversion
modes. Owing to the fact that fast conversion scales could be much smaller than
the ones of the traditional collective neutrino oscillations, it has been
speculated that fast modes could lead to some sort of flavor
decoherence/equilibrium. We study the evolution of fast modes in the nonlinear
regime and we show that not only fast modes are not guaranteed to lead to
flavor equilibrium, but also they could lead to some sort of collective
neutrino oscillations but on scales determined by neutrino number density. For
the $\nu_e$ dominated case, we observe large amplitude collective oscillations,
whereas a sort of flavor stabilization is reached for the $\bar{\nu}_e$

\ge 2$ sub-systems sharing a common wireless channel. Each sub-system consists
of a plant and a controller and the control message must be delivered from the
controller to the plant through the shared wireless channel. The wireless
channel is unreliable due to interference and fading. As a result, a packet can
be successfully delivered in a slot with a certain probability. A network
scheduling policy determines how to transmit those control messages generated
by such $N$ sub-systems and directly influences the transmission delay of
control messages. We first consider the case that all sub-systems have the same
sampling period. We characterize the stability condition of such a WNCS under
the joint design of the control policy and the network scheduling policy by
means of $2^N$ linear inequalities. We further simplify the stability condition
into only one linear inequality for two special cases: the perfect-channel case
where the wireless channel can successfully deliver a control message with
certainty in each slot, and the symmetric-structure case where all sub-systems
have identical system parameters. We then consider the case that different
sub-systems can have different sampling periods, where we characterize a

principal objective of this study is to estimate the depth information

extraction is measured from a single still holoscopic 3D image which consists
of multiple viewpoint images. The viewpoints are extracted and utilised for
disparity calculation via disparity space image technique and pixels
displacement is measured with sub pixel accuracy to overcome the issue of the
narrow baseline between the viewpoint images for stereo matching. In addition,
cost aggregation is used to correlate the matching costs within a particular
neighbouring region using sum of absolute difference SAD combined with
gradient-based metric and winner takes all algorithm is employed to select the
minimum elements in the array as optimal disparity value. Finally, the optimal
depth map is obtained using graph cut technique. The proposed method extends
the utilisation of holoscopic 3D imaging system and enables the expansion of
the technology for various applications of autonomous robotics, medical,

defined via the R\'enyi divergence, playing a significant role in evaluating
the performance of information processing tasks by virtue of its connection to
the error exponent analysis. In quantum information theory, there are three
generalizations of the classical R\'enyi divergence -- the Petz's, sandwiched,
and log-Euclidean versions, that possess meaningful operational interpretation.
However, the associated quantum R\'enyi and Augustin information are much less
explored compared with their classical counterpart, and lacking crucial
properties hinders applications of these quantities to error exponent analysis
in the quantum regime. The goal of this paper is to analyze fundamental
properties of the R\'enyi and Augustin information from a noncommutative
measure-theoretic perspective. Firstly, we prove the uniform equicontinuity for
all three quantum versions of R\'enyi and Augustin information, and it hence
yields the joint continuity of these quantities in order and prior input
distributions. Secondly, we establish the concavity of the scaled R\'enyi and
Augustin information in the region of $s\in(-1,0)$ for both Petz's and the
sandwiched versions. This completes the open questions raised by Holevo [IEEE

[Commun.~Math.~Phys., 355(1):373--426, 2017]. For the applications, we show
that the strong converse exponent in classical-quantum channel coding satisfies
a minimax identity, which means that the strong converse exponent can be
attained by the best constant composition code. The established concavity is
further employed to prove an entropic duality between classical data
compression with quantum side information and classical-quantum channel coding,
and a Fenchel duality in joint source-channel coding with quantum side
information.

direction in the FM phase, very similar to that observed in the prototypical
ferromagnetic shape memory alloy (FSMA) Ni$_{2}$MnGa. This specific instability
is not observed in the FI phase. Further finite temperature first principles
lattice dynamics calculations reveal that at 300 K the FM phase becomes
mechanically stable, while the FI phase continue to remain unstable providing
credence to the fact that the high-temperature phase has FM order. These
results will be primordial to understand the magneto-structural properties of

shown how the symplectization of contact manifolds provides a new vantage
point; enabling, among others, to switch between the energy and entropy
representations of a thermodynamic system. In the present paper this is
continued towards the global geometric definition of a degenerate Riemannian
metric on the homogeneous Lagrangian submanifold describing the state
properties, which is overarching the locally defined metrics of Weinhold and
Ruppeiner. Next, a geometric formulation is given of non-equilibrium
thermodynamic processes, in terms of Hamiltonian dynamics defined by
Hamiltonian functions that are homogeneous of degree one in the co-extensive
variables and zero on the homogeneous Lagrangian submanifold. The
correspondence between objects in contact geometry and their homogeneous
counterparts in symplectic geometry, as already largely present in the
literature, appears to be elegant and effective. This culminates in the

to non-coplanar / 3D model states and we present results for three cases: (a)
the spin-half one-dimensional Ising ferromagnet in an applied transverse
magnetic field (as an exactly solvable test model to use as a yardstick for the

equations for the ket- and bra-state correlation coefficients become

are manifestly real numbers, as required. Excellent correspondence is seen with
the results of other methods, where they exist, for these systems. CCM results
demonstrate explicitly that coplanar ordering is favoured over non-coplanar
ordering for the triangular-lattice spin-half Heisenberg antiferromagnet at all
values of the applied external magnetic field, whereas for the anisotropic {\it

The SrCuBO and triangular lattices also demonstrate high levels of magnetic
ordering, while the remaining lattices (bounce, maple-leaf, and trellis) tend
to lie between these extremes, again for all values of $s$. These results also
clearly reflect the strong increase in magnetic order with increasing spin
quantum number $s$ for all lattices. The ground-state energy, $E_g/(NJs^2)$,
scales with $s^{-1}$ to first order, as expected from spin-wave theory,
although the order parameter, $M/s$, scales with $s^{-1}$ for most of the
lattices only. Self-consistent spin-wave theory calculations indicated
previously that $M/s$ scales with $s^{-2/3}$ for the kagome lattice HAFM,
whereas previous CCM results (replicated here also) suggested that $M/s$ scales

language, performing translations between different representations of
mathematical formulae has thus far not been possible. We implemented the first
translator for mathematical formulae based on recursive neural networks. We
chose recursive neural networks because mathematical formulae inherently
include a structural encoding. In our implementation, we developed new
techniques and topologies for recursive tree-to-tree neural networks based on
multi-variate multi-valued Long Short-Term Memory cells. We propose a novel
approach for mini-batch training that utilizes clustering and tree traversal.
We evaluate our translator and analyze the behavior of our proposed topologies
and techniques based on a translation from generic LaTeX to the semantic LaTeX
notation. We use the semantic LaTeX notation from the Digital Library for
Mathematical Formulae and the Digital Repository for Mathematical Formulae at
the National Institute for Standards and Technology. We find that a simple
heuristics-based clustering algorithm outperforms the conventional clustering
algorithms on the task of clustering binary trees of mathematical formulae with
respect to their topology. Furthermore, we find a mask for the loss function,
which can prevent the neural network from finding a local minimum of the loss
function. Given our preliminary results, a complete translation from formula to
formula is not yet possible. However, we achieved a prediction accuracy of
47.05% for predicting symbols at the correct position and an accuracy of 92.3%
when ignoring the predicted position. Concluding, our work advances the field
of recursive neural networks by improving the training speed and quality of
training. In the future, we will work towards a complete translation allowing a

a computationally inexpensive quasi-two-dimensional model. Two Reynolds numbers
of $5000$ and $15\,000$ and an extensive range of Hartmann numbers $0 \leq Ha
\leq 800$ were investigated. Three broad regimes are identified in which
optimal mode topology and non-modal growth mechanisms are distinct. These
regimes corresponding to low, moderate and high magnetic field strengths are
found to be governed by the independent parameters, Hartmann number, Reynolds
number based on the Hartmann layer thickness $R_H$, and Reynolds number built
upon the Shercliff layer thickness $R_S$, respectively. Transition between
regimes respectively occurs at $Ha \approx 2$ and no lower than $R_H \approx
33.\dot{3}$. Notably for the high Hartmann number regime, quasi-two-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic models are shown to be an excellent predictor of not only
transient growth magnitudes, but also the fundamental growth mechanisms of
linear disturbances. This paves the way for a precise analysis of transition to
quasi-two-dimensional turbulence at much higher Hartmann numbers than is

becomes stronger. The electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient are

hook-shaped flare-ribbons. We build upon this finding and further address the
joint questions of their time-evolution, and of the formation of flare loops at
the ends of flaring PILs of the erupting bipole, which are both relevant for
flare understanding in general and for ICME studies in particular. We calculate
QSLs and relevant field lines in an MHD simulation of a torus-unstable
flux-rope. The evolving QSL footprints are used to define the outer edge of the
flux rope at different times, and to identify and characterize new 3D
reconnection geometries and sequences that occur above the ends of the flaring
PIL. We also analyse flare-ribbons as observed in EUV by SDO/AIA and IRIS
during two X-class flares. The flux-rope footpoints are drifting during the
eruption, which is unexpected due to line-tying. This drifting is due to a
series of coronal reconnections that erode the flux rope on one side and
enlarge it on the other side. Other changes in the flux-rope footpoint-area are
due to multiple reconnections of individual field lines whose topology can
evolve sequentially from arcade to flux rope and finally to flare loop. These
are associated with deformations and displacements of QSL footprints, which
resemble those of the studied flare ribbons. Our model predicts continuous
deformations and a drifting of ICME flux-rope footpoints whose areas are
surrounded by equally-evolving hooked-shaped flare-ribbons, as well as the
formation of flare loops at the ends of flaring PILs which originate from the
flux-rope itself, both of which being due to purely three-dimensional
reconnection geometries. The observed evolution of flare-ribbons in two events
supports the model, but more observations are required to test all its
predictions.

climate models partly due to a lack of atmospheric observations. At moderate
supercooling ice nucleating particles (INP) and ice particles (IP) are present
in small concentrations and a large volume of air is necessary for observation.
Here, we report on initial observations of IP in supercooled fog with a new
setup. We use a 0.3 m wide, vertical curtain of light and a camera pointing
perpendicularly at it to record light scattered by IP formed in radiation fog
near the ground at temperatures between -3 {\deg}C and -9 {\deg}C. Deposition
rates of IP were several times larger than expected from number concentrations
of INP found on $PM_{10}$-filters at a nearby air quality monitoring station.
The discrepancy might be explained by secondary ice formation through the
fragmentation of freezing water droplets, the entrainment of INP from above the
fog layer through settling, the loss or deactivation of INP on
$PM_{10}$-filters prior to analysis, or radiative cooling of INP below the
temperature of the surrounding air. In summary, radiation fog constitutes an
easily accessible form of a supercooled cloud, in which observations can be
made for long enough to quantify the deposition rate of rare IP produced in a
natural environment.

properties. Such experiments are traditionally performed by studying the active
or the brownian fluctuation of trapped particles in the X, Y, Z direction. Here
we find that employing the fourth dimension, rotation, allows for sensitive and
fast probing of the surface. Optical tweezers are capable of rotating trapped
birefringent microparticles when applied with circularly polarized light, thus
called the Rotational Optical Tweezers. When the trapped birefringent
microparticle is far enough away from the surface, the rotation rate is
dependent only on the laser power. However, we find that if one traps close to
a surface, the rotation rate goes to zero even at finite tweezers laser powers
for some specific type of substrates. We suspect this to be due to interaction
between the substrate and the birefringent particle, keeping in mind that the
hydrodynamic drag for this mode of rotation cannot increase beyond 1.2 times
the drag away from the surface. We use this to probe some surfaces and find
that there is no binding for hydrophobic ones but hydrophilic ones particularly
tend to show a power threshold beyond which the birefringent particle starts
rotating. We calculate that the threshold energy of the tweezers is consistent
with the Van der Waals potential energy, when the mode of interaction with the
surface is purely physical. We also find that for chitosan, the mode of
interaction is possibly different from Van der Waals. We place the particle on
the threshold and observe stick-slip kind of rotational behaviour.

photons from the vacuum as a result of a non-adiabatic change of a system
parameter or boundary condition. As opposed to standard parametric
amplification where the modulation occurs both in space and in time, this
fundamental process requires a pure modulation in time, which makes its
detection particularly challenging at optical frequencies. In this paper we
experimentally demonstrate a realisation of the optical analogue of the
mechanical dynamical Casimir effect in the near-infrared optical regime in a
dispersion-oscillating photonic crystal fibre. The experiments are based on the
equivalence of the spatial modulation of the fibre core diameter to a pure
temporal modulation when this is considered in the co-moving frame of the
travelling pump pulse. We provide evidence of optical dynamical Casimir effect
by measuring quantum correlations between the spectrally resolved photon pairs.
The non-classical nature of the measured light is supported by evidence of
anti-bunching photon statistics.

  Optimal Matching in an observational study of spine surgical interventions",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), which has been used to
estimate sample average treatment effects (SATE) using observational data,
tenuously relies on the positivity assumption and the correct specification of
the treatment assignment model, both of which are problematic assumptions in
many observational studies. Various methods have been proposed to overcome
these challenges, including truncation, covariate-balancing propensity scores,
and stable balancing weights. Motivated by an observational study in spine
surgery, in which positivity is violated and the true treatment assignment
model is unknown, we present the use of optimal balancing by Kernel Optimal
Matching (KOM) to estimate SATE. By uniformly controlling the conditional mean
squared error of a weighted estimator over a class of models, KOM
simultaneously mitigates issues of possible misspecification of the treatment
assignment model and is able to handle practical violations of the positivity
assumption, as shown in our simulation study. Using data from a clinical
registry, we apply KOM to compare two spine surgical interventions and
demonstrate how the result matches the conclusions of clinical trials that IPTW
estimates spuriously refute.

progress has been made in the field of hybrid mechanical devices, in which a
qubit is coupled to a mechanical oscillator. Strong coupling in such devices
has been demonstrated with superconducting qubits, and coupling defect qubits
to mechanical elements via crystal strain has enabled novel methods of qubit
measurement and control. In this paper we demonstrate the fabrication of
diamond optomechanical crystals with embedded nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, a
preliminary step toward reaching the quantum regime with defect qubit hybrid
mechanical devices. We measure optical and mechanical resonances of diamond
optomechanical crystals as well as the spin coherence of single embedded NV
centers. We find that the spin has long coherence times $T_2^* = 1.5 \mu s$ and
$T_2 = 72 \mu s$ despite its proximity to nanofabricated surfaces. Finally, we
discuss potential improvements of these devices and prospects for future

  Incidents using Wrist Wearables","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1710.03755",,,,"cs.HC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Distracted pedestrians, like distracted drivers, are an increasingly
dangerous threat and precursors to pedestrian accidents in urban communities,
often resulting in grave injuries and fatalities. Mitigating such hazards to
pedestrian safety requires employment of pedestrian safety systems and
applications that are effective in detecting them. Designing such frameworks is
possible with the availability of sophisticated mobile and wearable devices
equipped with high-precision on-board sensors capable of capturing fine-grained
user movements and context, especially distracted activities. However, the key
technical challenge is accurate recognition of distractions with minimal
resources in real-time given the computation and communication limitations of
these devices. Several recently published works improve distracted pedestrian
safety by leveraging on complex activity recognition frameworks using mobile
and wearable sensors to detect pedestrian distractions. Their primary focus,
however, was to achieve high detection accuracy, and therefore most designs are
either resource intensive and unsuitable for implementation on mainstream
mobile devices, or computationally slow and not useful for real-time pedestrian
safety applications, or require specialized hardware and less likely to be
adopted by most users. In the quest for a pedestrian safety system, we design
an efficient and real-time pedestrian distraction detection technique that
overcomes some of these shortcomings. We demonstrate its practicality by
implementing prototypes on commercially-available mobile and wearable devices
and evaluating them using data collected from participants in realistic
pedestrian experiments. Using these evaluations, we show that our technique
achieves a favorable balance between computational efficiency, detection
accuracy and energy consumption compared to some other techniques in the
literature.

process of local topological and dynamical information, and find that the
Barabasi-Albert scale-free network (BA network) is beneficial to the diffusion
and leads nodes to arrive at a larger state value than other networks do. The
ability of diffusion for a node is related to its own degree. Specifically,
nodes with smaller degrees are more likely to change their states and reach
larger values, while those with larger degrees tend to stick to their original
states. We introduce state entropy to analyze the thermodynamic mechanism of
the diffusion process, and interestingly find that this kind of diffusion
process is a minimization process of state entropy. We use the inequality
constrained optimization method to reveal the restriction function of the
minimization and find that it has the same form as the Gibbs free energy. The
thermodynamical concept allows us to understand dynamical processes on complex

third space dimension, providing advantages over conventional planar
architectures. In particular, volumetric electromagnetic antennas can
demonstrate superior characteristics, outperforming their planar counterparts.
Here a new approach to the fabrication of electromagnetic devices is developed
and applied to antennas, implemented on curved surfaces. Highly directive and
broadband antennas were 3D-printed on hemispherical supports. The antenna
skeleton and the support were simultaneously printed with different polymer
materials - PLA mixed with graphene flakes and pure PLA, respectfully. Weakly
DC-conductive graphene PLA-based skeleton was post-processed and high-quality
conductive copper layer was selectively electrochemically deposited on it. The
antenna devices were found to demonstrate radiation performance, similar to
that achievable with conventional fabrication approaches. However, additive
manufacturing of RF antennas provides superior capabilities of constructing
tailor-made devices with properties, pre-defined by non-standardized end users.
