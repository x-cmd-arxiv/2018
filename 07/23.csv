Communications 5, 3096 (2014). The method exploits the exquisite efficiency in
the detection of phonons achievable in ion crystals, and is thus particularly
suitable for species with broad non-cycling transitions where detection of
fluorescence photons is impractical. Here, we develop a theoretical model for
the description of photon recoil spectroscopy based on a Fokker-Planck equation
for the Wigner function of the phonon mode. Our model correctly explains
systematic shifts due to Doppler heating and cooling as observed in the
experiment. Furthermore, we investigate quantum metrological schemes for
enhancing the spectroscopic sensitivity based on the preparation and detection
of nonclassical states of the phonon mode.

(EFTC) that is based on the Standard Model coupled to General Relativity and
improved with Weyl symmetry. There are no new physical degrees of freedom in
this theory, but what is new is an enlargement of the domain of the existing
physical fields and of spacetime via the larger symmetry, thus curing the
geodesic incompleteness of the traditional theory. Invoking the softer behavior
of an underlying theory of quantum gravity, I further argue that it is
reasonable to ban higher curvature terms in the effective action, thus making
this EFTC mathematically well behaved at gravitational singularities, as well
as geodesically complete, thus able to make new physics predictions. Using this
EFTC, I show some predictions of surprising behavior of the universe at
singularities including a unique set of big-bang initial conditions that emerge
from a dynamical attractor mechanism. I will illustrate this behavior with
detailed formulas and plots of the classical solutions and the quantum
wavefunction that are continuous across singularities for a cosmology that
includes the past and future of the big bang. The solutions are given in the
geodesically complete global mini-superspace that is similar to the extended
spacetime of a black hole or extended Rindler spacetime. The analytic
continuation of the quantum wavefunction across the horizons describes the
passage through the singularities. This analytic continuation solves a
long-standing problem of the singular (-1/r^2) potential in quantum mechanics
that dates back to Von Neumann. The analytic properties of the wavefunction
also reveal an infinite stack of universes sewn together at the horizons of the
geodesically complete space. Finally a critique of recent controversial papers
using the path integral approach in cosmology is given.

minimized given the available harvested energy. No prior knowledge of the
stochastic processes that govern the channel, captured data, or harvested

accord with the available experimental data. It is suggested that, upon
increasing atomic number from Ru to Ag, the 4$f$ electrons should become
increasingly localized. An itinerant-localized crossover for 4$f$ electrons
driven by chemical pressure may emerge when $M$ changes from Pd to Ag.
Particularly, according to the low-frequency behaviors of 4$f$ self-energy
functions, we identify an orbital selective 4$f$ insulating state in
CeAg$_{2}$Si$_{2}$, which is totally unexpected.

models of graph streams:
  In the edge-arrival model we see a stream of edges which collectively define
a graph, this model has been well-studied for a variety of problems. We first
show that the space complexity for a one-pass streaming algorithm to find a
maximal independent set is quadratic (i.e. we must store all edges). We further
show that the problem does not become much easier if we only require
approximate maximality.
  In the ""explicit"" vertex stream model, the input stream is a sequence of
vertices making up the graph, where every vertex arrives along with its
incident edges that connect to previously arrived vertices. Various graph
problems require substantially less space to solve in this setting than for
edge-arrival streams. We show that every one-pass $c$-approximation algorithm
for maximum independent set (MIS) on explicit vertex streams requires space
$\Omega(\frac{n^2}{c^7})$, where $n$ is the number of vertices of the input
graph, and it is already known that space $\tilde{\Theta}(\frac{n^2}{c^2})$ is
necessary and sufficient in the edge arrival model (Halld\'orsson et al. 2012).
The MIS problem is thus not significantly easier to solve under the explicit
vertex arrival order assumption. Our result is proved via a reduction to a new
multi-party communication problem closely related to pointer jumping.
  In the ""implicit"" vertex stream model, the input stream consists of a
sequence of objects, one per vertex. The algorithm is equipped with a function
that can map a pair of objects to the presence or absence of an edge, thus
defining the graph. This model captures, for example, geometric intersection
graphs such as unit disc graphs. Our final set of results consists of several
improved upper and lower bounds for ball intersection graphs, in both explicit
and implicit streams.

a mobile intruder inside a polygonal environment as a multi-robot task
allocation (MRTA) problem. Leveraging on guard deployment strategies in art
gallery problems for mobile coverage, we show that the problem of finding the
minimum speed of guards to persistently track a single mobile intruder is
NP-hard. Next, for a given maximum speed of the intruder and the guards, we
propose a technique to partition a polygon, and compute a feasible allocation
of guards to the partitions. We prove the correctness of the proposed
algorithm, and show its completeness for a specific class of inputs. We
classify the guards based on the structural properties of the partitions
allocated to them. Based on the classification, we propose motion strategy for
the guards to track the mobile intruder when it is located in the partition
allocated to the guard. Finally, we extend the proposed technique to address
guard deployment and allocation strategies for non-simple polygons and multiple

particle-like properties promising for information technology applications.
Perhaps the most important aspect of interacting particles is their ability to
form thermodynamically distinct phases from gases and liquids to crystalline
solids. Dilute gases of skyrmions have been realized in artificial multilayers,
and solid crystalline skyrmion lattices have been observed in bulk skyrmion
hosting materials. Yet, to date melting of the skyrmion lattice into a skyrmion
liquid has not been reported experimentally. Through direct imaging with
cryo-Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, we demonstrate that the skyrmion
lattice in the material Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ can be dynamically melted. Remarkably,
we discover this melting process to be a topological defects mediated two-step
transition via a theoretically hypothesized hexatic phase to the liquid phase.
The existence of hexatic and liquid phases instead of a simple fading of the
local magnetic moments upon thermal excitations implies that even in bulk
materials skyrmions possess considerable particle nature, which is a
pre-requisite for application schemes.

First, we present an algorithm to identify {\it candidate vertices} in a

quantify the size of the region under the influence of outflows. In the third
of a series of papers, we present the spatially-resolved kinematics of ionized
gas for 3 additional type 2 AGNs based on the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph
(GMOS) integral field spectroscopy. Along with the 6 AGNs presented in our
previous works and the 14 AGNs with available GMOS IFU data, we construct a
sample of 23 luminous type 2 AGNs at z < 0.2, and kinematically measure the
size of ionized gas outflows by tracing the radial decrease of the velocity
dispersion of the [O iii] {\lambda}5007 emission line. The
kinematically-measured outflow size ranges from 0.60 to ~7.45 kpc, depending on
AGN luminosity. We find that the size of the photoionized region is larger than
the kinematically-measured outflow size, while the flux-weighted
photoionization size is significantly smaller. Thus, using the photoionization
size as a proxy for the outflow size will lead to overestimation or
underestimation, and introduce a large uncertainty of the mass outflow rate and
the energy output rate. We report the outflow size-luminosity relation with a
slope of 0.28{\pm}0.03, which is shallower than the slope of the correlation

transcriptome sequencing data are collected for $n$ genes across $p$ conditions

PaloBoost, a Stochastic Gradient TreeBoost model that uses novel regularization

PaloBoost uses the under-utilized out-of-bag samples to perform gradient-aware
pruning and estimate adaptive learning rates. Unlike other Stochastic Gradient
TreeBoost models that use the out-of-bag samples to estimate test errors,
PaloBoost treats the samples as a second batch of training samples to prune the
trees and adjust the learning rates. As a result, PaloBoost can dynamically
adjust tree depths and learning rates to achieve faster learning at the start
and slower learning as the algorithm converges. We illustrate how these
regularization techniques can be efficiently implemented and propose a new
formula for calculating feature importance to reflect the node coverages and
learning rates. Extensive experimental results on seven datasets demonstrate
that PaloBoost is robust to overfitting, is less sensitivity to the parameters,
and can also effectively identify meaningful features.

level, with modelling Background Independence in mind. In particular, we give a
structural analysis of its reduced configuration spaces, decomposing this
subject matter into basic Topology, Geometry, Group Theory, Linear Algebra,
Graph Theory and Order Theory. At the metric level, these configuration spaces
of shapes form basic geometric series for 1- and 2-$d$: $\mathbb{S}^{N - 2}$
and $\mathbb{CP}^{N - 2}$, though there are no more such series for $d \geq 3$.
$d \geq 3$ also sees an onset of stratification. Casson's diagonal, for which
$N = d + 1$, plays a critical role which we explain in simple Linear Algebra
terms; these are moreover topologically spheres. $N = d$ and $N = d + 2$ have
further significance as well, the latter as regards a counting notion of
genericity of the isotropy groups and kinematical orbits realized. These
observations twin the $N$ = (3, 4, 5) progression in qualitative complexity
that almost all $N$-Body Problem work for concrete $N$ concentrates on with the
much better-known $N$ = (2, 3, 4) progression in 2-$d$: from intervals to
triangles to quadrilaterals: a large source of intuitions and mathematical
analogies. We furthermore provide an Order-Theoretic genericity criterion,
which is almost always bounded by the double-slope $N = 2 d + 1$ line, though
an accidental relation pushes $N$ up by 1 to 8 in 3-$d$. We finally consider
rubber shapes, for which the configuration spaces are graphs: much simpler than
stratified manifolds, and yet containing quite a few of metric-level shapes'
qualitative features. This singles out $N = 5$ and 6 in 1-$d$ and $N = 6$ and 8
in $\geq$ 2-$d$ for the onsets of various graph-theoretical nontrivialities.

  based Data Augmentation","6 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Segmentation of skin lesions is considered as an important step in computer
aided diagnosis (CAD) for automated melanoma diagnosis. In recent years,
segmentation methods based on fully convolutional networks (FCN) have achieved
great success in general images. This success is primarily due to the
leveraging of large labelled datasets to learn features that correspond to the
shallow appearance as well as the deep semantics of the images. However, the
dependence on large dataset does not translate well into medical images. To
improve the FCN performance for skin lesion segmentations, researchers
attempted to use specific cost functions or add post-processing algorithms to
refine the coarse boundaries of the FCN results. However, the performance of
these methods is heavily reliant on the tuning of many parameters and
post-processing techniques. In this paper, we leverage the state-of-the-art
image feature learning method of generative adversarial network (GAN) for its
inherent ability to produce consistent and realistic image features by using
deep neural networks and adversarial learning concept. We improve upon GAN such
that skin lesion features can be learned at different level of complexities, in
a controlled manner. The outputs from our method is then augmented to the
existing FCN training data, thus increasing the overall feature diversity. We
evaluated our method on the ISIC 2018 skin lesion segmentation challenge
dataset and showed that it was more accurate and robust when compared to the
existing skin lesion segmentation methods.

patient accrual rate and use novel adaptive designs. Unfortunately, these two
strategies often conflict when the evaluation of the outcome cannot keep pace
with the patient accrual rate and thus the interim data cannot be observed in
time to make adaptive decisions. A similar logistic difficulty arises when the
outcome is of late onset. Based on a novel formulation and approximation of the
likelihood of the observed data, we propose a general methodology for
model-assisted designs to handle toxicity data that are pending due to fast
accrual or late-onset toxicity, and facilitate seamless decision making in
phase I dose-finding trials. The dose escalation/de-escalation rules of the
proposed time-to-event model-assisted designs can be tabulated before the trial
begins, which greatly simplifies trial conduct in practice compared to that
under existing methods. We show that the proposed designs have desirable finite
and large-sample properties and yield performance that is superior to that of
more complicated model-based designs. We provide user-friendly software for
implementing the designs.

composite spectrum on lattice volumes up to $64^3 \times 128$. The spectrum
indirectly indicates spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, but
finite-temperature transitions with fixed $N_t \leq 24$ enter a strongly
coupled lattice phase as the fermion mass decreases, which prevents a direct
confirmation of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the chiral limit. In
addition to the connected spectrum we focus on the lightest flavor-singlet
scalar particle. We find it to be degenerate with the pseudo-Goldstone states
down to the lightest masses reached so far by non-perturbative lattice
calculations. Using the same lattice approach, we study the behavior of the
composite spectrum when the number of light fermions is changed from eight to

  overlap with arXiv:1711.01050",,,,"cs.GT cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mobile crowdsensing has shown a great potential to address large-scale data
sensing problems by allocating sensing tasks to pervasive mobile users. The
mobile users will participate in a crowdsensing platform if they can receive
satisfactory reward. In this paper, to effectively and efficiently recruit
sufficient number of mobile users, i.e., participants, we investigate an
optimal incentive mechanism of a crowdsensing service provider. We apply a
two-stage Stackelberg game to analyze the participation level of the mobile
users and the optimal incentive mechanism of the crowdsensing service provider
using backward induction. In order to motivate the participants, the incentive
is designed by taking into account the social network effects from the
underlying mobile social domain. For example, in a crowdsensing-based road
traffic information sharing application, a user can get a better and accurate
traffic report if more users join and share their road information. We derive
the analytical expressions for the discriminatory incentive as well as the
uniform incentive mechanisms. To fit into practical scenarios, we further
formulate a Bayesian Stackelberg game with incomplete information to analyze
the interaction between the crowdsensing service provider and mobile users,
where the social structure information (the social network effects) is
uncertain. The existence and uniqueness of the Bayesian Stackelberg equilibrium
are validated by identifying the best response strategies of the mobile users.
Numerical results corroborate the fact that the network effects tremendously
stimulate higher mobile participation level and greater revenue of the
crowdsensing service provider. In addition, the social structure information
helps the crowdsensing service provider to achieve greater revenue gain.

learns from the dynamics of the gene expression. The learnt DNN behaves like an
accurate simulator of the system, on which one can perform in-silico
experiments to reveal the underlying gene network. We demonstrate the method
with two examples: biochemical adaptation and the gap-gene patterning in fruit
fly embryogenesis. In the first example, the DNN can successfully find the two
basic network motifs for adaptation - the negative feedback and the incoherent
feed-forward. In the second and much more complex example, the DNN can
accurately predict behaviors of essentially all the mutants. Furthermore, the
regulation network it uncovers is strikingly similar to the one inferred from
experiments. In doing so, we develop methods for deciphering the gene
regulation network hidden in the DNN ""black box"". Our interpretable DNN

accelerating nonthermal particles. However, so far there is little clear
observational signatures of relativistic magnetic reconnection events in
astrophysical systems. Blazars are relativistic magnetized plasma outflows from
supermassive black holes. Their multi-wavelength flares may be powered by
relativistic magnetic reconnection. The highly variable radiation and
polarization signatures are well covered by multi-wavelength observation
campaigns, making them ideal targets to examine the magnetic reconnection
model. Recent observations have found that several blazar flares are
accompanied by optical polarization angle swings which may be of as large
amplitude as $> 180^{\circ}$, challenging existing theoretical models. In this
paper, we present integrated particle-in-cell (PIC) and polarized radiation
transfer simulations of magnetic reconnection events. We find that plasmoid
coalescences in the reconnection layer can give rise to highly variable light

angle. In particular, large-amplitude polarization angle swings, similar to
those observed during blazar flares, can be a unique signature of relativistic

Sagittarius A* at the center of our Milky Way galaxy, allow us to study the
properties of black holes and the nature of strong-field gravity. According to
the Kerr hypothesis, isolated, stationary, and axisymmetric astrophysical black
holes are described by the Kerr metric. The Kerr hypothesis holds in General
Relativity and in some modified gravity theories, but there are others in which
it is violated. In principle, black hole shadow observations can be used to
determine if the Kerr metric is the correct description for black holes, and in
turn, they could be used to place constraints on modified gravity theories that
do not admit the Kerr solution. We here investigate whether black hole shadow
observations can constrain deviations from general relativity, focusing on two
well-motivated modified quadratic gravity theories:
Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. We
show that current constraints on Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity are
stronger than any that could be placed with black hole shadow observations of
supermassive black holes. We also show that the same holds for dynamical
Chern-Simons gravity through a systematic bias and a likelihood analysis when
considering slowly-rotating supermassive black holes. However, observations of
more rapidly-rotating black holes, with dimensionless spins
$|\vec{J}|/M^{2}\simeq0.5$, could be used to better constrain dynamical
Chern-Simons gravity.

requires joint labeling of both actor and action categories in video frames.
One major challenge for this task is that when an actor performs an action,
different body parts of the actor provide different types of cues for the
action category and may receive inconsistent action labeling when they are
labeled independently. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end
region-based actor-action segmentation approach which relies on region masks
from an instance segmentation algorithm. Our main novelty is to avoid labeling
pixels in a region mask independently - instead we assign a single action label
to these pixels to achieve consistent action labeling. When a pixel belongs to
multiple region masks, max pooling is applied to resolve labeling conflicts.
Our approach uses a two-stream network as the front-end (which learns features
capturing both appearance and motion information), and uses two region-based
segmentation networks as the back-end (which takes the fused features from the
two-stream network as the input and predicts actor-action labeling).
Experiments on the A2D dataset demonstrate that both the region-based
segmentation strategy and the fused features from the two-stream network
contribute to the performance improvements. The proposed approach outperforms
the state-of-the-art results by more than 8% in mean class accuracy, and more
than 5% in mean class IOU, which validates its effectiveness.

nonlinearity makes the energy infinitely large at the center of the binary ball

for active atmospheric circulation, which induces a large-scale patchiness in
the cloud structure that evolves significantly over time, as evidenced by
infrared light curves and Doppler maps. These observations raise critical
questions about the fundamental nature of the circulation, its time
variability, and the overall relationship to the circulation on Jupiter and
Saturn. Jupiter and Saturn themselves exhibit numerous robust zonal (east-west)
jet streams at the cloud level; moreover, both planets exhibit long-term
stratospheric oscillations involving perturbations of zonal wind and
temperature that propagate downward over time on timescales of ~4 years
(Jupiter) and ~15 years (Saturn). These oscillations, dubbed the Quasi
Quadrennial Oscillation (QQO) for Jupiter and the Semi-Annual Oscillation (SAO)
on Saturn, are thought to be analogous to the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO)
on Earth, which is driven by upward propagation of equatorial waves from the
troposphere. To investigate these issues, we here present global,
three-dimensional, high-resolution numerical simulations of the flow in the
stratified atmosphere--overlying the convective interior--of brown dwarfs and
Jupiter-like planets. The effect of interior convection is parameterized by
inducing small-scale, randomly varying perturbations in the
radiative-convective boundary at the base of the model. In the simulations, the
convective perturbations generate atmospheric waves and turbulence that
interact with the rotation to produce numerous zonal jets. Moreover, the
equatorial stratosphere exhibits stacked eastward and westward jets that
migrate downward over time, exactly as occurs in the terrestrial QBO, Jovian
QQO, and Saturnian SAO. This is the first demonstration of a QBO-like
phenomenon in 3D numerical simulations of a giant planet.

equations are quadratic in the fields, we show that it is possible to find

specialized for the case of forces and torques distributed over filaments in
three dimensions. The new formulation is based on the exact solution of Stokes
equation generated by a linear continuous distribution of regularized forces
along a line segment. Therefore, a straight filament with linearly varying
forces does not require discretization. A general filament is approximated by a
piecewise linear curve in three dimensions where the length of each line
segment is chosen only based on the variation of the force field and the
desired accuracy of its piecewise linear approximation. The most significant
advantage of this formulation is that the values of the regularization
parameter $\epsilon$ and the length of the segments $h$ are decoupled as long
as $\epsilon<h$ so that $\epsilon$ can be selected as a proxy for the radius of
the filament and $h$ is chosen to discretize the forces and torques. We analyze
the performance on test problems and present biological applications of sperm
motility based on existing models of swimming flagella in open space and near a
plane wall. The results show, for example, that because the forces along the
flagellum vary mildly, a flagellum can be approximated with as few as 11
segments of length $h$ while fixing the regularization parameter to
$\epsilon=h/30$, overcoming the need for hundreds of discretization nodes
required by the MRS when $\epsilon$ is small. The filament behaves like a
slender cylindrical tube of radius $\approx 0.97\epsilon$ so that the value of
$\epsilon$ influences the flagellum's swimming speed. For fixed regularization,
doubling the number of line segments does not affect the results significantly
as long as the force field is resolved. Examples that require rotlets and
potential dipoles along the filament are also presented.

finite-field approaches in which the relativistic effects have been included
approximately, while the other calculation uses a four component perturbed RCC
method. However, another work adopting an approach similar to the latter
perturbed RCC method gives a result very close to that of experiment. The major
difference between these two perturbed RCC approaches lies in their
implementation. To resolve this ambiguity, we have developed and employed the
relativistic normal coupled-cluster (RNCC) theory to evaluate the $\alpha_d$

for the expectation value in this approach terminates naturally and that it
satisfies the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. In addition, we determine this quantity

decision process (MDP) model, in particular, the following parameters: state
values, V; state-action values, Q; and policy, pi. These parameters are
commonly implemented as an array. Scaling up the problem means scaling up the
size of the array and this will quickly lead to a computational bottleneck. To
get around this, the RL problem is commonly formulated to learn a specific task
using hand-crafted input features to curb the size of the array. In this
report, we discuss an alternative end-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
approach where the DRL attempts to learn general task representations which in
our context refers to learning to play the Pong game from a sequence of screen
snapshots without game-specific hand-crafted features. We apply artificial
neural networks (ANN) to approximate a policy of the RL model. The policy
network, via Policy Gradients (PG) method, learns to play the Pong game from a
sequence of frames without any extra semantics apart from the pixel information
and the score. In contrast to the traditional tabular RL approach where the
contents in the array have clear interpretations such as V or Q, the
interpretation of knowledge content from the weights of the policy network is
more illusive. In this work, we experiment with various Deep ANN architectures
i.e., Feed forward ANN (FFNN), Convolution ANN (CNN) and Asynchronous Advantage
Actor-Critic (A3C). We also examine the activation of hidden nodes and the
weights between the input and the hidden layers, before and after the DRL has
successfully learnt to play the Pong game. Insights into the internal learning

be able to directly image mature Jovian planets in reflected light, a critical
step in support of future facilities that aim to directly image terrestrial
planets in reflected light (e.g. HabEx, LUVOIR). These future facilities are
considering the use of photometry to classify planets. Here, we investigate the
intricacies of using colors to classify gas-giant planets by analyzing a grid
of 9,120 theoretical reflected light spectra spread across different
metallicities, pressure-temperature profiles, cloud properties, and phase
angles. We determine how correlated these planet parameters are with the colors
in the \emph{WFIRST} photometric bins and other photometric bins proposed in
the literature. Then we outline under what conditions giant planet populations
can be classified using several supervised multivariate classification
algorithms. We find that giant planets imaged in reflected light can be
classified by metallicity with an accuracy of $>$90\% if they are \emph{a
prior} known to not have significant cloud coverage in the visible part of the
atmosphere, and at least 3 filter observations are available. If the presence
of clouds is not known \emph{a priori}, directly imaged planets can be more
accurately classified by their cloud properties, as oppposed to metallicity or
temperature. Furthermore, we are able to distinguish between cloudy and
cloud-free populations with $>$90\% accuracy with 3 filter observations. Our
statistical pipeline is available on GitHub and can be extended to optimize

Recently, it was proposed that an appropriate strain texture in graphene can

magnetic field. This opened the door to control quantum transport by mechanical
means and to explore unprecedented physics in high-field regime. Such studies
have been achieved in molecular and photonic lattices. Here we report the first
experimental realization of giant uniform pseudomagnetic field in acoustics by
introducing a simple uniaxial deformation to acoustic graphene. Benefited from
the controllability of our macroscopic platform, we observe the acoustic Landau
levels in frequency-resolved spectroscopy and their spatial localization in
pressure-field distributions. We further visualize the quantum-Hall-like edge
states (connected to the zeroth Landau level), which have been elusive before
owing to the challenge in creating large-area uniform pseudomagnetic fields.
These results, highly consistent with our full-wave simulations, establish a
complete framework for artificial structures under constant pseudomagnetic
fields. Our findings, conceptually novel in acoustics, may offer new

determine velocity thresholds for the onset of dissipation as a function of the
sphere radius up to 1.8 nm and at external pressures of zero and 1 bar. The
threshold was observed to decrease with the sphere radius and increase with
pressure thus showing that the onset of dissipation does not involve roton
emission events (Landau critical velocity), but rather vortex emission (Feynman
critical velocity), which is also confirmed by the observed periodic response
of the hydrodynamic observables as well as visualization of the liquid current
circulation. An empirical model, which considers the ratio between the boundary
layer kinetic and vortex ring formation energies, is presented for
extrapolating the current results to larger length scales. The calculated
critical velocity value at zero pressure for a sphere that mimics an electron

to its ability to excite quantized Kelvin waves around the vortex rings during

public tweets with images posted by youth who mention gang associations on
Twitter can be leveraged to automatically detect psychosocial factors and
conditions that could potentially assist social workers and violence outreach
workers in prevention and early intervention programs. To this end, we
developed a rigorous methodology for collecting and annotating tweets. We
gathered 1,851 tweets and accompanying annotations related to visual concepts
and the psychosocial codes: aggression, loss, and substance use. These codes
are relevant to social work interventions, as they represent possible pathways
to violence on social media. We compare various methods for classifying tweets
into these three classes, using only the text of the tweet, only the image of
the tweet, or both modalities as input to the classifier. In particular, we
analyze the usefulness of mid-level visual concepts and the role of different
modalities for this tweet classification task. Our experiments show that
individually, text information dominates classification performance of the loss
class, while image information dominates the aggression and substance use
classes. Our multimodal approach provides a very promising improvement (18%
relative in mean average precision) over the best single modality approach.
Finally, we also illustrate the complexity of understanding social media data

Neural networks trained using a blur profile matching the human eye yielded the

possibly multidisciplinary research, this paper describes an analysis on the
journals from which articles have been cited in the journal articles published
by Wageningen University & Research (WUR) staff in 2006-2015. The journals with
cited articles are inventoried from the reference lists of the WUR journal
articles. For each WUR article a mean dissimilarity is calculated between the
journal in which it has been published and the journals that contain the cited
articles. Dissimilarities are derived from a large matrix with similarity
values between journals, calculated from co-citations to these journals from
the same WUR articles published in 2006-2015. For 21,191 WUR articles published
in 2,535 journals mean dissimilarities have been calculated. For WUR articles
with high mean dissimilarities this paper shows that they often are published
in multidisciplinary journals. WUR articles with high mean dissimilarities also
are found in non-multidisciplinary (research field specific) journals. For
these articles (with high mean dissimilarities) this paper shows that citations
are often made to more various research fields than for articles with lower
mean dissimilarities. The mean dissimilarities, calculated per WUR article,
also can be aggregated for the journals in which they have been published. This
results in a listing of journals than can be ordered on the mean dissimilarity
of the WUR articles that have been published in them. The analysis described in

source domains to unseen target domains. The main difficulty comes from the
dataset bias: training data and test data have different distributions, and the
training set contains heterogeneous samples from different distributions. Let
$X$ denote the features, and $Y$ be the class labels. Existing domain
generalization methods address the dataset bias problem by learning a
domain-invariant representation $h(X)$ that has the same marginal distribution
$\mathbb{P}(h(X))$ across multiple source domains. The functional relationship
encoded in $\mathbb{P}(Y|X)$ is usually assumed to be stable across domains
such that $\mathbb{P}(Y|h(X))$ is also invariant. However, it is unclear
whether this assumption holds in practical problems. In this paper, we consider
the general situation where both $\mathbb{P}(X)$ and $\mathbb{P}(Y|X)$ can
change across all domains. We propose to learn a feature representation which
has domain-invariant class conditional distributions $\mathbb{P}(h(X)|Y)$. With
the conditional invariant representation, the invariance of the joint
distribution $\mathbb{P}(h(X),Y)$ can be guaranteed if the class prior
$\mathbb{P}(Y)$ does not change across training and test domains. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method.

Therefore, we propose two more advanced solutions. The first one still applies
mintermisation but in a local way, mitigating the size of the exponential
blowup. The other one focuses on a novel symbolic way of dealing with

time on the number of transitions from quadratic to linear). We perform a
thorough experimental evaluation of all the algorithms, together with several

introducing the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ gauge degrees of freedom, characterizing both
the toric code state and double semion state. Via calculating the correlation
length defined from the one-dimensional quantum transfer operator of the wave
function norm, we can map out the complete phase diagram in terms of the
parameter $\lambda $ and identify three different quantum critical points
(QCPs) at $\lambda =0$, $\pm 1.73$. The first one separates the toric code
phase and double semion phase, while later two describe the topological phase
transitions from the toric code phase or double semion phase to the symmetry
breaking phase, respectively. When mapping to the exactly solved statistical
models, the norm of the tensor network wave function is transformed into the
partition function of the eight-vertex model. Actually such a quantum-classical
mapping can not reveal the rich structures of low-energy excitations at these
three QCPs. So we further demonstrate that the full eigenvalue spectra of the
transfer operators with/without the flux insertions can describe the complete
quantum criticalities, which are characterized by the two-dimensional
compactified free boson conformal field theories (CFTs) with the compactified
radii $R=\sqrt{6}$ for the QCPs at $\lambda =\pm\sqrt{3}$ and $R=\sqrt{8/3}$

condensation, and the emerged matrix product operator symmetries result in a
rich structure of the low-energy excitations, distinct from those of both toric
code and double semion phases. Finally, we discuss the possible relation
between our conformal quantum criticalities and the general (2+1) spatial-time
dimensional CFTs for quantum topological phase transitions.

a problem in Diophantine approximation"" Furstenberg introduced the notion of
disjointness of dynamical systems, both topological and measure preserving. In
this paper he showed that for actions of the integers the Bernoulli system
$\Omega = \{0, 1\}^\mathbb{Z}$, is disjoint from every minimal system, and that
the subring $R_0$, over the field $\mathbb{Z}_2 =\{0, 1\}$, generated by the
minimal functions in $\Omega$, is a proper subset of $\Omega$. He conjectured
that a similar result holds in general and in our 1983 work ""Interpolation sets

the closed subalgebra $\mathfrak{A}$ of $l^\infty(\mathbb{Z})$, generated by
the minimal functions, is a proper subalgebra of $l^\infty(\mathbb{Z})$. In
this work we generalize these results to a large class of groups. We call a
countable group $G$ a DJ group if for every metrizable minimal action of $G$
there exists an essentially free minimal action disjoint from it. We show that
amenable groups are DJ and that the DJ property is preserved under direct
products. We define a simple dynamical condition DDJ on minimal systems, which
is a strengthening of the Gottchalk-Hedlund property, and we say that a group
$G$ is DDJ if every minimal $G$-system has this property. The DJ property
implies DDJ and by means of an intricate construction we show that every
finitely generated DDJ group is also DJ. Residually finite, maximally almost
periodic and $C^*$-simple groups are all DDJ. Finally we show that

detected by the violations of Mermin inequality and Svetlichny inequality,
respectively. Since tripartite quantum nonlocality has novel applications in
quantum information and quantum computation, it is important to investigate
whether more than three observers can share tripartite nonlocality,
simultaneously. In the present study we answer this question in the
affirmative. In particular, we consider a scenario where three
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles are spatially separated and shared between Alice,
Bob and multiple Charlies. Alice performs measurements on the first particle;
Bob performs measurements on the second particle and multiple Charlies perform
measurements on the third particle sequentially. In this scenario we
investigate how many Charlies can simultaneously demonstrate standard
tripartite nonlocality and genuine tripartite nonlocality with single Alice and
single Bob. The interesting result revealed by the present study is that at
most six Charlies can simultaneously demonstrate standard tripartite
nonlocality with single Alice and single Bob. On the other hand, at most two
Charlies can simultaneously demonstrate genuine tripartite nonlocality with
single Alice and single Bob. Hence, the present study shows that standard
tripartite nonlocality can be simultaneously shared by larger number of
Charlies compared to genuine tripartite nonlocality in the aforementioned
scenario, which implies that standard tripartite nonlocality is more effective
than genuine tripartite nonlocality in the context of simultaneous sharing by
multiple observers.

of the first stars, black holes and galaxies. The radiation from the first
galaxies plays an important role in determining the final state of primordial
gas collapsing in a neighboring halo. This is due to the fact that the primary
coolant for primordial gas is molecular hydrogen, which can be dissociated into
atomic hydrogen by Lyman-Werner photons in the energy range $11.2 - 13.6$~eV.
While cooling by molecular hydrogen leads to Pop. III star formation, cooling
by atomic hydrogen can lead to the formation of a supermassive star (or
quasi-star) which results in the formation of a massive $10^{4-5} M_\odot$
black hole, or a direct collapse black hole. The spectrum of this radiation
field is critical in order to determine whether a primordial gas cloud forms a

clear ambiguity in such mappings.
  We work with adversarial training methods based on IPMs and derive a novel
risk bound, which upper bounds the risk between the learned mapping $h$ and the
target mapping $y$, by a sum of three terms: (i) the risk between $h$ and the
most distant alternative mapping that was learned by the same cross-domain
mapping algorithm, (ii) the minimal discrepancy between the target domain and
the domain obtained by applying a hypothesis $h^*$ on the samples of the source

is directly related to Occam's razor and encourages the selection of the
minimal architecture that supports a small mapping discrepancy and (iii) an
approximation error term that decreases as the complexity of the class of
discriminators increases and is empirically shown to be small.
  The bound leads to multiple algorithmic consequences, including a method for
hyperparameters selection and for early stopping in cross-domain mapping GANs.

this more general expression, and present a series of approximations of this

insufficient in describing the molecular charge transport characteristics and
gives rise to a number of artefacts, especially at lower temperatures.
Alternative expressions, retaining its mathematical simplicity but rectifying
those shortcomings, are suggested. In particular, we show how lifetime
broadening can be consistently incorporated into Marcus theory, and we derive a
low-temperature correction to the semi-classical Marcus hopping rates. Our
results are applied to examples building on phenomenological as well as
microscopically-motivated electron-vibrational coupling. We expect them to be
particularly useful in experimental studies of charge transport through

pressure, and wind gives its momentum to the ocean surface which produces
waves. Modeling and simulation (M&S) of free surface flow can be a very useful
tool for the wave energy industry. However, if these tools are to be relied
upon, their accuracy must be tested and shown to be sound. In this
investigation, we focus on verification and validation (V&V) of wave tank flow
M&S. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) model was applied to perform transient
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis using the numerical simulation
software OpenFOAM. To assess V&V, the height of the free surface flow was
considered as the system response quantity (SRQ). Stokes theory (fifth order)
was utilized as the most accurate available approximation of the exact solution
to measure the order of accuracy of the discretized mathematical model which is
known as code verification. Data collected during model-scale testing at the
Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) Maneuvering and
Seakeeping (MASK) basin were utilized to validate the computational results.
The CFD domain consists of a two-dimensional plane representing the region of
interest of the wave basin which has several wave height measurement probes.
Our simulation results were compared to the data from one of these probes in
order to conduct the V&V analysis. Code verification and comparison with
experimental values demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our model.

whether the LSE can capture the residual signal from a given trigger, we test
whether the LSE is able to capture the pattern of seismic shaking caused by an
earthquake from the distribution of seismically induced landslides, without
prior knowledge of the earthquake being included in the statistical model. We
assess the landslide intensity, i.e., the expected number of landslide
activations per mapping unit, for the area in which landslides triggered by the
Wenchuan (M 7.9, May 12, 2008) and Lushan (M 6.6, April 20, 2013) earthquakes
overlap. We chose an area of overlapping landslides in order to test our method
on landslide inventories located in the near and far fields of the earthquake.
We generated three different models for each earthquake-induced landslide
scenario: i) seismic parameters only (as a proxy for the trigger); ii) the LSE
only; and iii) both seismic parameters and the LSE. The three configurations
share the same set of morphometric covariates. This allowed us to study the
pattern in the LSE and assess whether it adequately approximated the effects of
seismic wave propagation. Moreover, it allowed us to check whether the LSE
captured effects that are not explained by the shaking levels, such as
topographic amplification. Our results show that the LSE reproduced the shaking
patterns in space for both earthquakes with a level of spatial detail even
greater than the seismic parameters. In addition, the models including the LSE
perform better than conventional models featuring seismic parameters only.

X-ray band. Most of the radiated energy, however, is released at optical/UV
wavelengths. In spite of decades of investigation, the physics of flares is not
fully understood. Even less is known about the powerful flares routinely
observed from pre-main sequence stars, which might significantly influence the
evolution of circumstellar disks. Observations of the NGC2264 star forming
region were obtained in Dec. 2011, simultaneously with three telescopes,
Chandra (X-rays), CoRoT (optical), and Spitzer (mIR), as part of the
""Coordinated Synoptic Investigation of NGC2264"" (CSI-NGC2264). Shorter Chandra
and CoRoT observations were also obtained in March 2008. We analyzed the
lightcurves to detect X-ray flares with an optical and/or mIR counterpart.
Basic flare properties from the three datasets, such as emitted energies and
peak luminosities, were then compared to constrain the spectral energy
distribution of the flaring emission and the physical conditions of the
emitting regions. Flares from stars with and without circumstellar disks were
also compared to establish any difference that might be attributed to the
presence of disks. Seventy-eight X-ray flares with an optical and/or mIR
counterpart were detected. Their optical emission is found to correlate well
with, and to be significantly larger than, the X-ray emission. The slopes of
the correlations suggest that the difference becomes smaller for the most
powerful flares. The mIR flare emission seems to be strongly affected by the
presence of a circumstellar disk: flares from stars with disks have a stronger
mIR emission with respect to stars without disks. This might be attributed to
the reprocessing of the optical (and X-ray) flare emission by the inner
circumstellar disk, providing evidence for flare-induced disk heating.

function as a performance metric is defined as a combination of the
D-optimality criterion of the Fisher information matrix. The convexity of the
cost function is proved and the optimal solution for deployment and guidance
problem is derived by the Frank-Wolfe method, also known as the conditional
gradient descent method. An intuitive optimal approach to deal with the problem
is to direct the sensor to the optimal position obtained by solving a nonlinear
optimization problem. On the other hand, the proposed method takes the
conditional gradient of the cost function as the command to the deployed
sensors, so that the sensors are guaranteed to be in the feasible points and
they achieve the current best performance. Simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm provides better performance than directing each sensor
to its optimal position.

contributions to avoid congestions and prevent road accidents, and more
particularly at road intersections since these areas are more prone to
accidents. In this context, one of the main impairments that affect the
performance of VSCs are interference. In this paper, we develop a tractable
framework to model cooperative transmissions in presence of interference for
VSCs at intersections. We use tools from stochastic geometry, and model
interferer vehicles locations as a Poisson point process. First, we calculate
the outage probability (OP) for a direct transmission when the received node
can be anywhere on the plan. Then, we analyze the OP performance of a
cooperative transmission scheme. The analysis takes into account two
dimensions: the decoding strategy at the receiver, and the vehicles mobility.
We derive the optimal relay position, from analytical and simulation results,
for different traffic densities and for different vehicles mobility models. We
also show that the OP does not improve after the number of infrastructure
relays reached a threshold value. Finally, we show that the OP performance of
VSCs is higher at intersections than on highways. We validated our analytical
results by Monte-Carlo simulations.

2009.0. Each EOF reanalysis also decomposes the measured SEIMF variation into a
hierarchy of spatiotemporal patterns which are ordered by their contribution to
the monthly magnetic field variance. We find that the leading EOF patterns can
each be (subjectively) interpreted as well-known SEIMF systems or their
equivalent current systems. The relationship of the equivalent currents to the
true current flow is not investigated. We track the leading SEIMF or equivalent
current systems of similar type by intermonthly spatial correlation and apply
graph theory to (objectively) group their appearance and relative importance
throughout a solar cycle, revealing seasonal and solar cycle variation. In this
way, we identify the spatiotemporal patterns that maximally contribute to SEIMF
variability over a solar cycle. We propose this combination of EOF and graph
theory as a powerful method for objectively defining and investigating the
structure and variability of the SEIMF or their equivalent ionospheric currents

optimization (FSO) approaches that leverage a probabilistic perspective to
implement the incremental proximity method (IPM). The present FSO methods are
derived based on the Kalman filter (KF) and the extended KF (EKF). In contrast
with typical methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and IPMs, they
do not need to pre-schedule the learning rate for convergence. Nevertheless,
they have limitations that inherit from the KF mechanism. As the particle
filtering (PF) method outperforms KF and its variants remarkably for nonlinear
non-Gaussian sequential filtering problems, it is natural to ask if FSO methods
can benefit from PF to get around of their limitations. We provide an
affirmative answer to this question by developing two PF based stochastic
optimizers (PFSOs). For performance evaluation, we apply them to address
nonlinear least-square fitting with simulated data, and empirical risk
minimization for binary classification of real data sets. Experimental results
demonstrate that PFSOs outperform remarkably a benchmark SGD algorithm, the
vanilla IPM, and KF-type FSO methods in terms of numerical stability,
convergence speed, and flexibility in handling diverse types of loss functions.

wind estimation have never been reported. In the present case study, we have
been using co-located meteor radar and sodium resonance lidar zonal wind
measurements over Andenes (69.27$^{\circ}$N, 16.04$^{\circ}$E) during intense
substorms in the declining phase of the January 2005 solar proton event (21-22
January 2005). In total, 14 h of measurements are available for the comparison,
which covers both quiet and disturbed conditions. For comparison, the lidar
zonal wind measurements are averaged over the same time and altitude as the
meteor radar wind measurements. High cross correlations ($\sim$0.8) are found
in all height regions. The discrepancies can be explained in light of
differences in the observational volumes of the two instruments. Further, we
extended the comparison to address the electric field and/or ionization impact
on the neutral wind estimation. For the periods of low ionization, the neutral
winds estimated with both instruments are quite consistent with each other.
During periods of elevated ionization, comparatively large differences are
noticed at the highermost altitude, which might be due to the electric field
and/or ionization impact on the wind estimation. At present, one event is not
sufficient to make any firm conclusion. Further study with more co-located
measurements are needed to test the statistical significance of the result.

understanding the mechanisms underlying large earthquakes and to detecting
their precursors. Low-frequency earthquakes (LFE) are a specific type of slow
EQ. In the present paper, we reveal the relevance of LFEs to the 2011 Great
Tohoku Earthquake (Tohoku-oki EQ) by means of cluster analysis. We classified
LFEs in northern Japan in a data-driven manner, based on inter-time, the time
interval between neighboring LFEs occurring within 10 km. We found that there
are four classes of LFE that are characterized by median inter-times of 24
seconds, 27 minutes, 2.0 days, and 35 days, respectively. Remarkably, in
examining the relevance of these classes to the Tohoku-oki EQ, we found that
activity in the shortest inter-time class (median 23 seconds) diminished
significantly at least three months before the Tohoku-oki EQ, and became
completely quiescent 30 days before the event (p-value = 0.00014). Further
statistical analysis implies that this class, together with a similar class of
volcanic tremor, may have served as a precursor of the Tohoku-oki EQ. We
discuss a generative model for these classes of LFE, in which the shortest
inter-time class is characterized by a generalized gamma distribution with the
product of shape parameters 1.54 in the domain of inter-time close to zero. We
give a possible geodetic interpretation for the relevance of LFE to the

is distributed differently than the luminous mass, increases as new data become

the magnitude and the compactness of the galaxy and on the radius, in units of
its luminous size $R_{opt}$, where the measurement is performed. For the disk
systems with $-13\geq M_I\geq -24$ all this leads to an amazing scenario,
revealed by the investigation of individual and coadded rotation curves,
according to which, the circular velocity follows, from their centers out to
their virial radii, an universal profile $V_{URC} (r/R_{opt}, M_I)$ function
only of the properties of the luminous mass component. Moreover, from the
Universal Rotation Curve, so as from many individual high-quality RCs, we
discover that, in the innermost regions of galaxies, the DM halo density
profiles are very shallow. Finally, the disk mass, the central halo density and
its core radius, come out all related to each other and to two properties of
the distribution of light in galaxies: the luminosity and the compactness. This
phenomenology, being absent in the simplest $\Lambda CDM$ Cosmology scenario,
poses serious challenges to the latter or, alternatively, it requires a
substantial and tuned involvement of baryons in the formation of the galactic
halos. On the other side, the URC helps to explain the two-accelerations

Lorentz invariance violation has been obtained at the dedicated GRAAL

Using the GRAAL's data we now get a new constraint on one of key tests of

energy scales are involved: first, via the position of the Compton Edge
determining the light speed in the reference frame of incident 6 GeV electrons
within the tagging system, second, in the calorimeter via the 1.27 MeV photons
of the ^22 Na source. The two energy scales are engaged to each other through
production of $\eta$ mesons by tagged laser Compton backscattered

more pronounced tendency of spontaneous global polar ordering in puller

of such order through a linear instability of the disordered state. For this

is needed, and we discuss corresponding approaches, particularly a heuristic
variant of the Percus test-particle method applied to active systems. Our
theory identifies an inherent evolution of polar order in planar systems of
puller microswimmers, if mutual alignment due to hydrodynamic interactions
overcomes the thermal dealignment by rotational diffusion. In the theory, the
cause of orientational ordering can be traced back to the actively induced
hydrodynamic rotation--translation coupling between the swimmers. Conversely,
disordered pusher suspensions remain linearly stable against homogeneous polar
orientational ordering. We expect that our results can be confirmed in
experiments on (semi-)dilute active microswimmer suspensions, based, for
instance, on biological pusher- and puller-type swimmers.

is built on top of first order logic with quantifiers over basic entities (for
modeling structures) combined with linear temporal logic (for modeling
behaviour). On top of this semantic foundation we build a simple but expressive
syntax, enriched with carefully selected syntactic expansions that cover
hierarchical modeling, associations, automata, scenarios, and Dwyer's property
patterns. We evaluate Clafer using a power window case study, and comparing it

liveness has been discussed for over two decades and a broad spectrum of

in the communities around three major ideas which incorporate liveness as an
important aspect: live programming, exploratory programming, and live coding.
While there have been publications on the focus of each particular community,
the overall spectrum of liveness across these three communities has not been
investigated yet. Thus, we want to delineate the variety of research on
liveness. At the same time, we want to investigate overlaps and differences in
the values and contributions between the three communities.
  Therefore, we conducted a literature study with a sample of 212 publications
on the terms retrieved from three major indexing services. On this sample, we
conducted a thematic analysis regarding the following aspects: motivation for
liveness, application domains, intended outcomes of running a system, and types
of contributions. We also gathered bibliographic information such as related
keywords and prominent publications.
  Besides other characteristics the results show that the field of exploratory
programming is mostly about technical designs and empirical studies on tools
for general-purpose programming. In contrast, publications on live coding have
the most variety in their motivations and methodologies with a majority being
empirical studies with users. As expected, most publications on live coding are
applied to performance art. Finally, research on live programming is mostly
motivated by making programming more accessible and easier to understand,
evaluating their tool designs through empirical studies with users.
  In delineating the spectrum of work on liveness, we hope to make the
individual communities more aware of the work of the others. Further, by giving
an overview of the values and methods of the individual communities, we hope to
provide researchers new to the field of liveness with an initial overview.

years. Recently, most approaches to the task explored different DNN
architectures to combine the representations of the words in a segment and
generate a segment representation that provides cues for intention. In this
study, we explore means to generate more informative segment representations,
not only by exploring different network architectures, but also by considering
different token representations, not only at the word level, but also at the
character and functional levels. At the word level, in addition to the commonly
used uncontextualized embeddings, we explore the use of contextualized
representations, which provide information concerning word sense and segment
structure. Character-level tokenization is important to capture
intention-related morphological aspects that cannot be captured at the word
level. Finally, the functional level provides an abstraction from words, which
shifts the focus to the structure of the segment. We also explore approaches to
enrich the segment representation with context information from the history of
the dialog, both in terms of the classifications of the surrounding segments
and the turn-taking history. This kind of information has already been proved
important for the disambiguation of DAs in previous studies. Nevertheless, we
are able to capture additional information by considering a summary of the
dialog history and a wider turn-taking context. By combining the best
approaches at each step, we achieve results that surpass the previous
state-of-the-art on generic DA recognition on both SwDA and MRDA, two of the
most widely explored corpora for the task. Furthermore, by considering both
past and future context, simulating annotation scenario, our approach achieves
a performance similar to that of a human annotator on SwDA and surpasses it on

calculate the polarization function of tilted Dirac cone for arbitrary tilt
parameter, $0\le \eta <1$, and arbitrary doping. This enables us to find two
interesting plasmonic effects solely caused by the tilt: (i) In addition to the
standard plasmon oscillations, strong enough tilt, induces an additional
linearly dispersing overdamped branch of plasmons, which is strongly Landau
damped due to overlap with a large density of intra-band free particle-hole
(PH) excitations. (ii) There appears a kink in the plasmon dispersion for any
non-zero tilt parameter. The kink appears when the plasmon branch enters the
inter-band continuum of PH excitations. This kink becomes most manifest for
wave vectors perpendicular to the tilt direction and fades away by approaching
the tilt direction. Experimental measurement of the wave vector and energy of
the plasmonic kink, when combined with our analytic formula for the kink energy
scale, allows for a direct experimental measurement of the tilt parameter.

spectral types in the range M0 - L1. Of these stars, 31 showed flares with a
duration between $\sim$10-90 min. Using distances obtained from Gaia DR2
parallaxes, we determined the energy of the flares to be in the range
$\sim1.2\times10^{29}-6\times10^{34}$ erg. In agreement with previous studies
we find rapidly rotating stars tend to show more flares, with evidence for a
decline in activity in stars with rotation periods longer than $\sim$10 days.
The rotational modulation seen in M dwarf stars is widely considered to result
from a starspot which rotates in and out of view. Flux minimum is therefore the
rotation phase where we view the main starspot close to the stellar disk
center. Surprisingly, having determined the rotational phase of each flare in
our study we find none show any preference for rotational phase. We outline
three scenarios which could account for this unexpected finding. The
relationship between rotation phase and flare rate will be explored further
using data from wide surveys such as NGTS and TESS.

computational cost of CNNs, large volumes such as MRI are typically processed
by subvolumes, for instance slices (axial, coronal, sagittal) or small 3D

analysed in two ways: long-term, which examines variability trends across years
or decades, and short-term, which looks at variability within a single
observation. The results are then compared to simulated spectra in order to
identify the physical components that they correspond to. It is found that
long-term variability for all objects is dominated by changes in a single power
law component. The primary component is responsible for more than 84 per cent
of the variability in every object, while the second component is responsible
for at least 3 per cent. Small differences in the shapes of these components
can be used to predict qualities such as the degree to which spectral
parameters are varying relative to one another, and correlations between
spectral hardness and flux. Short-term variability is less clear-cut, with no
obvious physical analogue for some of the PCA results. We discuss the
simulation process, and specifically remark on the consequences of the
breakdown of the linearity assumption of PCA and how it manifests in the real
data. We conclude that PCA is a useful tool for analysing variability, but only

processed by vectorizing the 2D into 1D estimation and solved via semi-definite

transform the functional equation into a boundary value problem; and finally
solve this problem, using a concept of anti-Tutte's invariant. The result is a

The first scale is the Fermi length $\sim h/p_{\rm F}$. By quantum shell
effect, the authors mean the existence of the new spatial scale, which is order
of the system size and much larger than the first scale. The theoretical
analysis for the large amount of free electrons ($N \lesssim 10^9$) in an
infinite spherical well demonstrates what causes the appearance of the spatial
nonuniformity and gives analytical expression for the electron distribution
function. These results are confirmed by a numerical summation of exact
solutions for the electron wave functions in an infinite potential well. It is
shown that an analogous effect for the spatial distribution of electrons exists
in a compressed hydrogen gas bubble of submicron size ($<0.1 \mu m$). The
numerical simulation of the electron distribution was carried out by the DFT

nontrivial dynamics of the compressible cold gas bubble. This system can be

adapt the number of discriminative regions per image using a simple, yet

Adi-Red to outperform the state of the art. Additional experimental analysis on

are specific to scenes. We attribute the effectiveness of Adi-Red to the

Accordingly, we introduce a framework based on evolutionary games where

Starting from the narrative of social behaviors in a pub as an illustration, we
first study the combination of the prisoner's dilemma and harmony game as two
alternative perceptions of the same situation. Considering a selection of game
pairs, our results show that the interplay between perception dynamics and game
payoffs gives rise to non-linear phenomena unexpected in each of the games
separately, such as catastrophic phase transitions in the cooperation basin of

Combining analytical techniques with multi-agent simulations we also show how
introducing individual perceptions can cause non-trivial dynamical behaviors to
emerge, which cannot be obtained by analyzing the system as a whole.
Specifically, initial heterogeneities at the microscopic level can yield a
polarization effect that is unpredictable at the macroscopic level. This
framework opens the door to the exploration of new ways of understanding the
link between the emergence of cooperation and individual preferences and

important step towards a technically correct result. In this paper we present a
two-component system to automate the task of resonance equalization. The first
component is a dynamic equalizer that automatically detects resonances and
offers to attenuate them by a user-specified factor. The second component is a
deep neural network that predicts the optimal attenuation factor based on the
windowed audio. The network is trained and validated on empirical data gathered
from an experiment in which sound engineers choose their preferred attenuation
factors for a set of tracks. We test two distinct network architectures for the
predictive model and find that a dilated residual network operating directly on
the audio signal is on a par with a network architecture that requires a prior
audio feature extraction stage. Both architectures predict human-preferred
resonance attenuation factors significantly better than a baseline approach.

  in Images and Videos",,,,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Object detection has been vigorously investigated for years but fast accurate
detection for real-world scenes remains a very challenging problem. Overcoming
drawbacks of single-stage detectors, we take aim at precisely detecting objects
for static and temporal scenes in real time. Firstly, as a dual refinement
mechanism, a novel anchor-offset detection is designed, which includes an
anchor refinement, a feature location refinement, and a deformable detection
head. This new detection mode is able to simultaneously perform two-step
regression and capture accurate object features. Based on the anchor-offset
detection, a dual refinement network (DRNet) is developed for high-performance
static detection, where a multi-deformable head is further designed to leverage
contextual information for describing objects. As for temporal detection in
videos, temporal refinement networks (TRNet) and temporal dual refinement
networks (TDRNet) are developed by propagating the refinement information
across time. We also propose a soft refinement strategy to temporally match
object motion with the previous refinement. Our proposed methods are evaluated
on PASCAL VOC, COCO, and ImageNet VID datasets. Extensive comparisons on static
and temporal detection verify the superiority of DRNet, TRNet, and TDRNet.
Consequently, our developed approaches run in a fairly fast speed, and in the
meantime achieve a significantly enhanced detection accuracy, i.e., 84.4% mAP
on VOC 2007, 83.6% mAP on VOC 2012, 69.4% mAP on VID 2017, and 42.4% AP on
COCO. Ultimately, producing encouraging results, our methods are applied to
online underwater object detection and grasping with an autonomous system.

was first introduced in [Czyzowicz et al., DISC'14], and extensively studied
(along with many variations) ever since with respect to worst case analysis. We
initiate the study of the same problem with respect to average case analysis,
which is also equivalent to designing randomized algorithms for the problem.
First we observe that algorithm $B_{2}$ of~[Czyzowicz et al., DISC'14] with
worst case cost $WRS(B_{2}):=5.73906$ has average case cost
$AVG(B_{2}):=5.1172$. Then we verify that none of the algorithms that induced
worst case cost improvements in subsequent publications has better average case
cost, hence concluding that our problem requires the invention of new
algorithms. Then, we observe that a remarkable simple algorithm, $B_{1}$, has
very small average case cost $AVG(B_{1}):=1+\pi$, but very high worst case cost
$WRS(B_{1}):=1+2\pi$.
  Motivated by the above, we introduce constrained optimization problem
$_2Evac_{F2F}^w$, in which one is trying to minimize the average case cost of
the evacuation algorithm given that the worst case cost does not exceed $w$.
The problem is of special interest with respect to practical applications,
since a common objective in search-and-rescue operations is to minimize the
average completion time, given that a certain worst case threshold is not
exceeded, e.g. for safety or limited energy reasons. Our main contribution is
the design and analysis of families of new evacuation parameterized algorithms
$A(p)$ which can solve $_2Evac_{F2F}^w$, for every $w \in
[WRS(B_{1}),WRS(B_{2})]$.

  Backhaul Load Trade--Off",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider multiple-antenna $K$-user interference channels
with backhaul collaboration in one side (among the transmitters or among the
receivers) and investigate the trade-off between the rate in the channel versus
the communication load in the backhaul. In this investigation, we focus on a
first order approximation result, where the rate of the wireless channel is
measured by the degrees of freedom (DoF) per user, and the load of the backhaul
is measured by the entropy of backhaul messages per user normalized by $\log$
of transmit power, at high power regimes. This trade-off is fully characterized
for the case of even values of $K$, and approximately characterized for the
case of odd values of $K$, with vanishing approximation gap as $K$ grows. For
full DoF, this result establishes the optimality (approximately) of the most
straightforward scheme, called Centralized Scheme, in which the messages are
collected at one of the nodes, centrally processed, and forwarded back to each
node. In addition, this result shows that the gain of the schemes, relying on
distributed processing, through pairwise communication among the nodes (e.g.,
cooperative alignment) does not scale with the size of the network. For the
converse, we develop a new outer-bound on the trade-off based on splitting the
set of collaborative nodes (transmitters or receivers) into two subsets, and
assuming full cooperation within each group. In continue, we further
investigate the trade-off for the cases, where the backhaul or the wireless
links (interference channel) are not fully connected.

  Two-way Relay Networks","Accepted to Globecom 2018. Copyright 2018 IEEE",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a multipair two-way relay communication network, where pairs of
user devices exchange information via a relay system. The communication between
users employs time division duplex, with all users transmitting simultaneously
to relays in one time slot and relays sending the processed information to all
users in the next time slot. The relay system consists of a large number of
single antenna units that can form groups. Within each group, relays exchange
channel state information (CSI), signals received in the uplink and signals
intended for downlink transmission. On the other hand, per-group CSI and
uplink/downlink signals (data) are not exchanged between groups, which perform
the data processing completely independently. Assuming that the groups perform
zero-forcing in both uplink and downlink, we derive a lower bound for the
ergodic sumrate of the described system as a function of the relay group size.
By close observation of this lower bound, it is concluded that the sumrate is
essentially independent of group size when the group size is much larger than
the number of user pairs. This indicates that a very large group of cooperating
relays can be substituted by a number of smaller groups, without incurring any
significant performance reduction. Moreover, this result implies that relay
cooperation is more efficient (in terms of resources spent on cooperation) when
several smaller relay groups are used in contrast to a single, large group.

two-dimensional partners of Weyl semimetals, arise from the linear crossings in

the emergence of intricate transport phenomena has been predicted, such as
modified Klein tunnelling, intrinsic anomalous Hall effects and ferrimagnetism.
However, Dirac materials are rare, particularly with tilted Dirac cones.
Recently, artificial materials whose building blocks present orbital degrees of
freedom have appeared as promising candidates for the engineering of exotic
Dirac dispersions. Here we take advantage of the orbital structure of photonic
resonators arranged in a honeycomb lattice to implement photonic lattices with
semi-Dirac, tilted and, most interestingly, type-III Dirac cones that combine
flat and linear dispersions. The tilted cones emerge from the touching of a
flat and a parabolic band with a non-trivial topological charge. These results
open the way to the synthesis of orbital Dirac matter with unconventional
transport properties and, in combination with polariton nonlinearities, to the
study of topological and Dirac superfluids in photonic lattices.

fact that there exists a variety of initial vortex configurations, such as the
initial vortex core structures, the starting speeds, the lateral and

leapfrogging appears to be a straightforward task, based on the vorticity
calculations for a number of initial vortices with different core structures.
Indeed, the evaluation of the unsteady vortex interactions requires accurate
numerical simulations, and the solutions are diverse and intriguing. In
particular, the impact of two asymmetric approaching vortices can produce
peeled-off fission vortices or cross-bred eddies of mushroom topology. Over the
course of flow development, we are unable to define any unique consistent
Reynolds number which may be used to classify the individual flows, because of
the multiplicity of characteristic lengths and velocity scales. Our key
observation is that the initial-boundary value problems of fluid motion do not

galaxies and their environment. Two prominent radio galaxies were identified in
a visual examination of the mosaic of XXL-North obtained with the Giant
Metrewave Radio Telescope at 610MHz. Counterparts were searched for in other
bands. Spectroscopic redshifts from the GAMA database were used to identify
clusters and/or groups of galaxies, estimate their masses with the caustic
method, and quantify anisotropies in the surrounding galaxy distribution via a
Fourier analysis. Both radio galaxies are of FR I type and are hosted by
early-type galaxies at a redshift of 0.138. The first radio source, named the
Exemplar, has a physical extent of about 400 kpc; it is located in the cluster
XLSSC112, which has a temperature of about 2 keV, a total mass of about
$10^{14} M_\odot$, and resides in an XXL supercluster with eight known members.
The second source, named the Double Irony, is a giant radio galaxy with a total
length of about 1.1 Mpc. Its core coincides with a cataloged point-like X-ray
source, but no extended X-ray emission from a surrounding galaxy cluster was
detected. However, from the optical data we determined that the host is the
brightest galaxy in a group that is younger, less virialized, and less massive
than the Exemplar's cluster. A friends-of-friends analysis showed that the
Double Irony's group is a member of the same supercluster as the Exemplar.
There are indications that the jets and plumes of the Double Irony have been
deflected by gas associated with the surrounding galaxy distribution. Another
overdensity of galaxies (the tenth) containing a radio galaxy was found to be
associated with the supercluster. Radio galaxies can be used to find galaxy
clusters/groups that are below the current sensitivity of X-ray surveys.

  In recent years, MSI---like many other HPC centers---has observed a growing
need for self-service, on-demand, data-intensive research, as well as the
emergence of many new controlled-access datasets for research purposes. In
light of this, MSI constructed a new on-premise cloud service, named Stratus,
which is architected from the ground up to easily satisfy data-use agreements
and fill four gaps left by traditional HPC. The resulting OpenStack cloud,
constructed from HPC-specific compute nodes and backed by Ceph storage, is
designed to fully comply with controls set forth by the NIH Genomic Data
Sharing Policy.
  Herein, we present twelve lessons learned during the ambitious sprint to take
Stratus from inception and into production in less than 18 months. Important,
and often overlooked, components of this timeline included the development of
new leadership roles, staff and user training, and user support documentation.
Along the way, the lessons learned extended well beyond the technical
challenges often associated with acquiring, configuring, and maintaining
large-scale systems.

by Balkanski, Rubinstein, and Singer [6] and Ene and Nguyen [21] resulted in a
near-optimal $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation in $O(\log n/\epsilon^2)$ rounds
of adaptivity. Partly motivated by the goal of extending these results to more
general constraints, we describe parallel algorithms for approximately
maximizing the multilinear relaxation of a monotone submodular function subject

oblivious to the specific submodular function. We thus derive randomized
algorithms with poly-logarithmic adaptivity for a number of constraints
including partition and laminar matroids, matchings, knapsack constraints, and
their intersections.

co-rotating vortices (TCV) and a secondary vortex lies beneath them and
counter-rotating with them, is behind the quasi-periodic self-sustained
bursting and reformation of the laminar separation bubble (LSB) and its
associated low-frequency flow oscillation (LFO). The upstream vortex of the TCV
(UV) is driven by the gradient of the oscillating-velocity across the laminar
portion of the separated shear layer and is faithfully aligned with it. The
secondary vortex acts as a roller support that facilitates the rotation and
orientation of the TCV. A global oscillation in the flow-field around the
aerofoil is observed in all of the investigated angles of attack, including at
zero angle of attack. The flow switches between an attached-phase against an
adverse pressure gradient (APG) and a separated-phase despite a favourable
pressure gradient (FPG) in a periodic manner with some disturbed cycles. When
the direction of the oscillating-flow is clockwise, it adds momentum to the
boundary layer and helps it to remain attached against the APG and vice versa.
The transition location along the separated shear layer moves upstream when the
oscillating-flow rotates in the clockwise direction causing early-transition
and vice versa. The best description of the mechanism is that of a whirligig.
When the oscillating-flow rotates in the clockwise direction, the UV whirls in
the clockwise direction and store energy until it is saturated, then the
process is reversed. The present investigation paves the way for formulating a
time-accurate physics-based model of the LFO and stall prediction, and opens
the door for control of its undesirable effects.

Metalearning, which takes advantage of problem characteristics (i.e.
metafeatures), one is able to predict the relative performance of algorithms.
In the Collaborative Filtering scope, recent works have proposed diverse
metafeatures describing several dimensions of this problem. Despite interesting
and effective findings, it is still unknown whether these are the most
effective metafeatures. Hence, this work proposes a new set of graph
metafeatures, which approach the Collaborative Filtering problem from a Graph
Theory perspective. Furthermore, in order to understand whether metafeatures
from multiple dimensions are a better fit, we investigate the effects of
comprehensive metafeatures. These metafeatures are a selection of the best
metafeatures from all existing Collaborative Filtering metafeatures. The impact
of the most representative metafeatures is investigated in a controlled
experimental setup. Another contribution we present is the use of a
Pareto-Efficient ranking procedure to create multicriteria metatargets. These
new rankings of algorithms, which take into account multiple evaluation
measures, allow to explore the algorithm selection problem in a fairer and more
detailed way. According to the experimental results, the graph metafeatures are
a good alternative to related work metafeatures. However, the results have
shown that the feature selection procedure used to create the comprehensive
metafeatures is is not effective, since there is no gain in predictive
performance. Finally, an extensive metaknowledge analysis was conducted to
identify the most influential metafeatures.

disorders like sleep apnea are increasing in prevalence, with the rapid
increase in factors like obesity. Sleep apnea is most commonly treated with
Continuous Positive Air Pressure (CPAP) therapy. Presently, however, there is
no mechanism to monitor a patient's progress with CPAP. Accurate detection of
sleep stages from CPAP flow signal is crucial for such a mechanism. We propose,
for the first time, an automated sleep staging model based only on the flow
signal. Deep neural networks have recently shown high accuracy on sleep staging
by eliminating handcrafted features. However, these methods focus exclusively
on extracting informative features from the input signal, without paying much
attention to the dynamics of sleep stages in the output sequence. We propose an
end-to-end framework that uses a combination of deep convolution and recurrent
neural networks to extract high-level features from raw flow signal with a
structured output layer based on a conditional random field to model the
temporal transition structure of the sleep stages. We improve upon the previous
methods by 10% using our model, that can be augmented to the previous sleep
staging deep learning methods. We also show that our method can be used to
accurately track sleep metrics like sleep efficiency calculated from sleep
stages that can be deployed for monitoring the response of CPAP therapy on
sleep apnea patients. Apart from the technical contributions, we expect this
study to motivate new research questions in sleep science.

in adaptive control. Since the lack of knowledge of system parameters can cause
it to become destabilized, an adaptive stabilization procedure is needed prior
to regulation. Therefore, the adaptive stabilization needs to be completed in
finite time. In order to achieve this goal, asymptotic approaches are not very
helpful. There are only a few existing non-asymptotic results and a full
treatment of the problem is not currently available.
  In this work, leveraging the novel method of random linear feedbacks, we
establish high probability guarantees for finite time stabilization. Our
results hold for remarkably general settings because we carefully choose a
minimal set of assumptions. These include stabilizability of the underlying
system and restricting the degree of heaviness of the noise distribution. To
derive our results, we also introduce a number of new concepts and technical
tools to address regularity and instability of the closed-loop matrix.

(wing length R less than about 4 mm and Reynolds number Re very low, about 80

moving in air is like in oil), sufficient vertical force could not be produced
if using the above wing kinematics. Small insects must use different flapping

relatively-large small insect (fruitfly: R=3 mm, Re=80) and a very small insect
(wasp: R=0.5 mm, Re=10), we put forward a hypothesis on how the flapping

U-shape upstroke will be used to overcome the viscous effect. And we test this
hypothesis by measuring the wing kinematics for species of different sizes to
obtain data for Re ranging from 80 to 10 and by computing the aerodynamic
forces. The data and computation support our hypothesis: the planar upstroke
changes to U-shape upstroke which becomes deeper as size or Re becomes smaller;
for relatively-large small insects, the U-shape upstroke produces a larger
vertical force than a planar upstroke by having a larger wing velocity, and for
very small insects, the deep U-shape upstroke produces a large transient drag
that points almost upwards by fast downward acceleration of the wing, providing
the required vertical force.

the advent of online professional networks (OPNs) has made it possible to

mitigate the amount of noise in the OPN data. We then devise several metrics to
measure the amount of work experience required to take up a job, to determine
that existence duration of the job (also known as the job age), and the
correlation between the above metric and propensity of hopping. We also study
how job hop behavior is related to job promotion/demotion. Lastly, we perform
connectivity analysis at job and organization levels to derive insights on

reflection coefficients of the electromagnetic waves on a graphene sheet
expressed via the polarization tensor and ultimately via the electrical
conductivity of graphene have been used. The reflectance of graphene is
computed as a function of frequency and chemical potential at different
temperatures and values of the band-gap parameter. The minimum values of the
reflectance are found which are reached in the infrared domain at the points of
vanishing imaginary part of the conductivity of graphene. For a gapped
graphene, the maximum reflectance equal to unity is reached at the points where
the imaginary part of conductivity diverges. The computational results
demonstrate an interesting interplay between the band gap and chemical

wide frequency intervals where the reflectance of graphene increases with
increasing chemical potential and decreasing band gap. The numerical
computations are found to be in good agreement with the analytic asymptotic
expressions in the regions of their applicability. Several technological areas,
where the obtained results could be used, are listed.

events are not solely driven by the size of a supporting population within a
socio-geographical location but rather a combination of ideological factors
that also depends upon the involvement of the host population. This
involvement, through the social, political and psychological fabric of society,
not only contributes to the active participation of terrorists within society
but also directly contributes to and increases the likelihood of the occurrence
of terrorist events.

events, the ideologies within the Muslim and non-Muslim population that
facilitates these terrorist events (such as Anti-Zionism) and anti-Semitic

conformal invariance of Maxwell's action is broken by the kinetic coupling
$f^{2}(\phi)F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$ of the electromagnetic field to the inflaton
field $\phi$. We consider the case where the coupling function $f(\phi)$
decreases in time during inflation and, as a result, the electric component of
the energy density dominates over the magnetic one. The system of equations
which governs the joint evolution of the scale factor, inflaton field, and
electric energy density is derived. The backreaction occurs when the electric
energy density becomes as large as the product of the slow-roll parameter
$\epsilon$ and inflaton energy density, $\rho_{E}\sim \epsilon \rho_{\rm inf}$.
It affects the inflaton field evolution and leads to the scale-invariant
electric power spectrum and the magnetic one which is blue with the spectral
index $n_{B}=2$ for any decreasing coupling function. This gives an upper limit
on the present-day value of observed magnetic fields below $10^{-22}\,{\rm G}$.
It is worth emphasizing that since the effective electric charge of particles
$e_{\rm eff}=e/f$ is suppressed by the coupling function, the Schwinger effect
becomes important only at the late stages of inflation when the inflaton field
is close to the minimum of its potential. The Schwinger effect abruptly
decreases the value of the electric field, helping to finish the inflation
stage and enter the stage of preheating. It effectively produces the charged
particles, implementing the Schwinger reheating scenario even before the fast
oscillations of the inflaton. The numerical analysis is carried out in the
Starobinsky model of inflation for the powerlike $f\propto a^{\alpha}$ and
Ratra-type $f=\exp(\beta\phi/M_{p})$ coupling functions.

$BR(K_L\rightarrow\pi^0\nu\bar\nu)$ using a high-energy secondary neutral beam
at the CERN SPS in a successor experiment to NA62. The timescale would require
many years; we assume that the experiment would be ready at the start of LHC
Run 4. Some preliminary conclusions from our feasibility studies, design
challenges faced and sensitivity obtainable for the measurement are here
presented.

  estimation of diffusion coefficients following the diffusion couple technique",,"Acta Materialia, Volume 156, 1 September 2018, Pages 420-431","10.1016/j.actamat.2018.04.051",,"physics.app-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The interdiffusion coefficients are estimated either following the Wagner's
method expressed with respect to the composition (mol or atomic fraction)
normalized variable after considering the molar volume variation or the den
Broeder's method expressed with respect to the concentration (composition
divided by the molar volume) normalized variable. On the other hand, the
relations for estimation of the intrinsic diffusion coefficients of components
as established by van Loo and integrated diffusion coefficients in a phase with
narrow homogeneity range as established by Wagner are currently available with
respect to the composition normalized variable only. In this study, we have
first derived the relation proposed by den Broeder following the line of
treatment proposed by Wagner. Further, the relations for estimation of the
intrinsic diffusion coefficients of the components and integrated
interdiffusion coefficient are established with respect to the concentration
normalized variable, which were not available earlier. The veracity of these
methods is examined based on the estimation of data in Ni-Pd, Ni-Al and Cu-Sn
systems. Our analysis indicates that both the approaches are logically correct
and there is small difference in the estimated data in these systems although a
higher difference could be found in other systems. The integrated
interdiffusion coefficients with respect to the concentration (or concentration
normalized variable) can only be estimated considering the ideal molar volume
variation. This might be drawback in certain practical systems.

  process: Modeling and experimental Approaches","27 pages, 13 figures",,,,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electrospraying is a widely-used technique for generating microspherical
droplets in biomedical and chemical applications and considered as an effective
approach for the deposition on substrate. However, studies on effects of
controllable parameters on deposition area of electrosprayed droplets have not
been reported yet. In this study, a simplified two-dimensional model is
developed to study the dynamic process of droplets and electrosprayed area. The
effects of distance between the needle tip and collector, and syringe feed rate
on the size of sprayed area are quantified. Experiments have been conducted to
validate the simulation results. Both modeling and experimental data
demonstrate that the diameter of sprayed area increases with increased distance
between the tip and collector as well as feed rate. This fundamental
understanding should contribute to a wise choice of controllable parameters to
achieve an efficient utilization of electrosparyed droplets or substrate for
real applications.
