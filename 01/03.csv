there is a recent trend of exploiting various information hiding techniques to
empower malware, for instance to bypass security frameworks of mobile devices

increasingly sophisticated security mechanisms, such as code analysis, runtime
countermeasures, or real-time traffic inspection tools. In this perspective,
this paper presents malware exploiting information hiding in a broad sense,
i.e., it does not focus on classical covert channels, but also discusses other
camouflage techniques. Differently from other works, this paper solely focuses
on real-world threats observed in the 2011 - 2017 timeframe. The observation
indicates a growing number of malware equipped with some form of data hiding

Moreover, surface effects are strongly amplified in lower dimensional systems

2D solution-processed natural quantum wells, where optoelectronic properties
can be tuned by varying the perovskite layer thickness. They are efficient
semiconductors with technologically relevant stability. Here, a generic elastic
model and electronic structure modelling are applied to LHPs heterostructures
with various layer thickness. We show that the relaxation of the interface
strain is triggered by perovskite layers above a critical thickness. This leads
to the release of the mechanical energy arising from the lattice mismatch,
which nucleates the surface reorganization and consequently the formation of
lower energy edge states. These states, which are absent in 3D perovskites,
dominate the optoelectronic properties of LHPs and are anticipated to play a
crucial role in the design of LHPs for optoelectronics devices.

learning the shapes of convolutional filters conditioned on the input feature

taking advantage of the nonlinear behavior of a strongly driven microwave

therefore to a high efficiency parity readout with a microwave photon counter

events, these particles must be replenished on time-scales of days. If dust is
indeed the source of KIC 8462852's dimming events, deeper dimming events should
show more neutral colours, as is expected from optically thick absorbers.

no two adjacent edges cross and any pair of independent edges cross at most
once. According to the celebrated Crossing Lemma of Ajtai, Chv\'atal, Newborn,
Szemer\'edi and Leighton, the number of crossings in $G$ is at least
$c{e^3\over n^2}$, for a suitable constant $c>0$. In a seminal paper, Sz\'ekely
generalized this result to multigraphs, establishing the lower bound
$c{e^3\over mn^2}$, where $m$ denotes the maximum multiplicity of an edge in
$G$. We get rid of the dependence on $m$ by showing that, as in the original
Crossing Lemma, the number of crossings is at least $c'{e^3\over n^2}$ for some
$c'>0$, provided that the ""lens"" enclosed by every pair of parallel edges in
$G$ contains at least one vertex. This settles a conjecture of Kaufmann.

hindered by surface depletion regions resulting from the presence of surface

(ITO) NCs as a means to manipulate the NC depletion width. We find in films of
ITO NCs of equal overall dopant concentration that those with dopant-enriched
surfaces show decreased depletion width and increased conductivity. Variable
temperature conductivity data shows electron localization length increases and
associated depletion width decreases monotonically with increased density of
dopants near the NC surface. We calculate band profiles for NCs of differing
radial dopant distributions and, in agreement with variable temperature
conductivity fits, find NCs with dopant-enriched surfaces have narrower
depletion widths and longer localization lengths than those with
dopant-enriched cores. Following amelioration of NC surface depletion by atomic
layer deposition of alumina, all films of equal overall dopant concentration
have similar conductivity. Variable temperature conductivity measurements on
alumina-capped films indicate all films behave as granular metals. Herein, we
conclude that dopant-enriched surfaces decrease the near-surface depletion
region, which directly increases the electron localization length and
conductivity of NC films.

variable star KIC 8462852 since the end of the Kepler space mission in 2013
May. Our regular photometric surveillance started in October 2015, and a
sequence of dipping began in 2017 May continuing on through the end of 2017,
when the star was no longer visible from Earth. We distinguish four main 1-2.5%
dips, named ""Elsie,"" ""Celeste,"" ""Skara Brae,"" and ""Angkor"", which persist on
timescales from several days to weeks. Our main results so far are: (i) there
are no apparent changes of the stellar spectrum or polarization during the
dips; (ii) the multiband photometry of the dips shows differential reddening
favoring non-grey extinction. Therefore, our data are inconsistent with dip
models that invoke optically thick material, but rather they are in-line with
predictions for an occulter consisting primarily of ordinary dust, where much
of the material must be optically thin with a size scale <<1um, and may also be
consistent with models invoking variations intrinsic to the stellar
photosphere. Notably, our data do not place constraints on the color of the
longer-term ""secular"" dimming, which may be caused by independent processes, or
probe different regimes of a single process.

$X=S^n$ with $n>0$, together with Adams' Hopf invariant one theorem, implies
that the set of spherical classes in $H_*QS^n$ is finite. We prove a filtered
version of the above the finiteness properties. We show that if $X$ is an
arbitrary $CW$-complex such that $H_*X$ is finite dimensional then the image of
the composition ${_2\pi_*}\Omega^l\Sigma^{l+2}X\to{_2\pi_*}Q\Sigma^2X\to

$H(n,k)$ for fixed $k$ and $n$ tending to infinity. The only non trivial upper

advances describing the effects of surfaces and clouds on transmission spectra,
to express the location of this boundary in atmospheric opacity space, both for
atomic and molecular extinction, as well as collision-induced absorption. This
allows one to quickly estimate how refraction affects spectral features in
well-mixed atmospheres. We show that differences in the geometry of limb
observations between solar system planets and exoplanets leads to different
locations of this boundary, and that more than four extra scale heights of
atmosphere are hidden in exoplanet transits compared to solar system
observations of cold gas giants. We explore how the location of this refractive
boundary in exoplanet transits changes in a well-mixed isothermal atmosphere
with its temperature and composition, the spectral type of the planet's host
star, and the size of the planet. We demonstrate that five extra scale heights
of atmosphere are hidden in a terrestrial planet with a CO$_2$ atmosphere
compared to a helium atmosphere, resulting in a flatter spectrum than from its
smaller scale height alone. We provide results for a few exoplanets, notably
those in the TRAPPIST-1 system, to help the scientific community estimate the

his prediction of the return of the comet named in his honor. Halley is also
known for offering an incorrect account of Earth's atmospheric general
circulation in 1686, specifically the cause of the easterly trade winds in the
tropics. In light of updated data and models, the notion of the 'wrongness' of
Halley's proposed explanation is reconsidered when cast within the milieu of
the prevailing cosmological model. The key ingredient to Halley's mechanism,
underappreciated at the time by Halley and his contemporaries, is the thermal
inertia of the climate system. It has been suggested by some authors that
Halley's ideas on atmospheric circulation were the first to ""go beyond the
Ptolemaic view of climate."" Ironically, Halley's explanation was essentially
correct, but only in a Ptolemaic (geocentric) universe.

higher than that of the Earth. For rocky exoplanets with 10-1000x Earth's H2O

chemistry, taking into account C partitioning, high-pressure ice phases, and
atmosphere-lithosphere exchange. Within our model, for Sun-like stars, we find
that: (1)~the duration of habitable surface water is strongly affected by ocean
chemistry; (2)~possible ocean pH spans a wide range; (3)~surprisingly, many
waterworlds retain habitable surface water for >1 Gyr, and (contrary to
previous claims) this longevity does not necessarily involve geochemical
cycling. The key to this cycle-independent planetary habitability is that C
exchange between the convecting mantle and the water ocean is curtailed by
seafloor pressure on waterworlds, so the planet is stuck with the ocean mass
and ocean cations that it acquires during the first 1% of its history. In our
model, the sum of positive charges leached from the planetary crust by early
water-rock interactions is - coincidentally - often within an order of
magnitude of the early-acquired atmosphere+ocean inorganic C inventory
overlaps. As a result, pCO2 is frequently in the ""sweet spot"" (0.2-20 bar) for
which the range of semimajor axis that permits surface liquid water is about as
wide as it can be. Because the width of the HZ in semimajor axis defines (for
Sun-like stars) the maximum possible time span of surface habitability, this
effect allows for Gyr of habitability as the star brightens. We illustrate our
findings by using the output of an ensemble of N-body simulations as input to
our waterworld evolution code. Thus (for the first time in an end-to-end
calculation) we show that chance variation of initial conditions, with no need
for geochemical cycling, can yield multi-Gyr surface habitability on

their own predictions' uncertainty. Moreover, the framework allows for fair

formally consider strategies capable of predicting full distributions from
feature variables, so-called probabilistic supervised learning strategies.
  Our work draws from prior work including Bayesian statistics, information

to (a) new theoretical insights such as a probabilistic bias-variance

the Dirac particle helicity. Because of the natural multipartite structure
involved, the Meyer-Wallach global measure of entanglement is preliminarily

Analytical solution is found for the quasistatic equilibrium concentration of a

Stability of a planar film surface with respect to small perturbations of the

are located atop a wetting layer that is modestly rich in the B phase. Then the

censored values, but censoring can be induced at a value, say tau, after which
the data values are thought to be unreliable. As noted in MSTL, some right
censored data require an assumption on the parametric form of the data beyond
{\tau}. While this assumption was given in MSTL, the implications of the
assumption were not sufficiently explored. Here we present simulations and
evaluate the methods of MSTL under type I censoring, give some settings under

centrifugal rotation and angular momentum spin parameters 2-3x higher than the
dark matter spin parameters. Thermal feedback can buoyantly rise to the outer

comprise significant deviations from HSE, especially net outward accelerations
seen in L* and group haloes indicating active feedback. Black hole feedback
acts in a preventative manner during the later growth of group haloes, applying
significant accelerations via shocks that do not feed tangential motions. We
argue that HSE is a poor assumption for the CGM, especially in the inner

type Ia supernova rates at high redshifts, leading to clues about the nature of
Ia supernova progenitors and constraints on the iron production in the
universe. A complementary approach is to investigate type Ia supernova rates in
individual, more nearby, galaxies. The popular A+B model for the specific
supernova rate, while reliable for a wide range of galaxy properties, diverges
for large specific star formation rates. Applying it outside its range of
validity could lead to the prediction of excessive type Ia supernova rates.
Moreover, the A+B model it is not directly derived from a delay time
distribution. We here introduce a new model which is explicitly motivated by a
simple delay time distribution composed of a prompt and a delayed component.
The model is in remarkably good agreement with current observational
constraints. It yields a prompt fraction of $f_{p}= 0.11^{+0.10}_{-0.06}$ in
agreement with results based on volumetric rates of type Ia supernovae at high

formation rates from the Illustris-1 simulation and is found to be self
consistent in the asymptotic limits. An analytic function that encapsulates the
features of the new model is shown to be in excellent agreement with the data.
In terms of goodness of fit, the new model is strongly preferred over the A+B
model. At $\log{({\rm sSFR})} \gtrsim -9$ there are no constraints from
observations. Observations in this regime will further constrain the delay time
distribution of type Ia supernovae at short delay times.

from stars and stellar BHs. Using this definition, similar to the well-known

BHS typical density with the GC central surface density profile, total
luminosity and observational half-mass radius. Our approach allows us to define
a unique way to connect the observational GCs parameters with their dark

These BHS are characterized by a relatively low typical density, $\rho_\bhs

masses in the range $m_\bhs = 14-22\Ms$. We also show that a similar approach

transfer to proceed stably the accretor must, in fact, be a black hole. Such
systems can form dynamically by the collision of a stellar-mass black hole with
a giant star. Tidal dissipation of energy in the giant's envelope leads to a
bound binary with a pericentre separation less than the radius of the giant. An
episode of common-envelope evolution follows, which ejects the giant's

that a realistic quantity of subsequent dynamical hardening is required for the

Cosmologically-motivated theories of galaxy formation need feedback from these
super-massive black holes to regulate star formation. In the absence of such
feedback, state-of-the-art numerical simulations dramatically fail to reproduce
the number density and properties of massive galaxies in the local Universe.
However, there is no observational evidence of this strongly coupled
co-evolution between super-massive black holes and star formation, impeding our
understanding of baryonic processes within galaxies. Here we show that the star
formation histories (SFHs) of nearby massive galaxies, as measured from their
integrated optical spectra, depend on the mass of the central super-massive
black hole. Our results suggest that black hole mass growth scales with gas
cooling rate in the early Universe. The subsequent quenching of star formation
takes place earlier and more efficiently in galaxies hosting more massive
central black holes. The observed relation between black hole mass and star
formation efficiency applies to all generations of stars formed throughout a

primordial black holes (PBH) as a dark matter candidate. As there are many
different observational probes of the PBH density across different masses,
constraints on PBH models are dependent on the functional form of the PBH mass
function. This complicates general statements about the mass functions allowed
by current data, and, in particular, about the maximum total density of PBH.
Numerical studies suggest that some forms of extended mass functions face
tighter constraints than monochromatic mass functions, but they do not preclude
the existence of a functional form for which constraints are relaxed. We use
analytical arguments to show that the mass function which maximizes the
fraction of the matter density in PBH subject to all constraints is a finite
linear combination of monochromatic mass functions. We explicitly compute the
maximum fraction of dark matter in PBH for different combinations of current
constraints, allowing for total freedom of the mass function. Our framework
elucidates the dependence of the maximum PBH density on the form of
observational constraints, and we discuss the implications of current and

complicated by the limited size of systems that can be feasibly examined with a
computer. When long-ranged electrostatic interactions are involved, the
resulting finite size effects can be substantial and may attenuate very slowly
with increasing system size, as shown by previous work on dilute ions in bulk
aqueous solution. Here we examine corrections for such effects, with an
emphasis on solvation near interfaces. Our central assumption follows the
perspective of H\""{u}nenberger and McCammon [J. Chem. Phys. 110, 1856 (1999)]:
Long-wavelength solvent response underlying finite size effects should be well
described by reduced models like dielectric continuum theory, whose size
dependence can be calculated straightforwardly. Applied to an ion in a periodic
slab of liquid coexisting with vapor, this approach yields a finite size
correction for solvation free energies that differs in important ways from
results previously derived for bulk solution. For a model polar solvent, we
show that this new correction quantitatively accounts for the variation of
solvation free energy with volume and aspect ratio of the simulation cell.
Correcting periodic slab results for an aqueous system requires an additional
accounting for the solvent's intrinsic charge asymmetry, which shifts electric
potentials in a size-dependent manner. The accuracy of these finite size
corrections establishes a simple method for a posteriori extrapolation to the
thermodynamic limit, and also underscores the realism of dielectric continuum
theory down to the nanometer scale.

mathematical models of nonlinear structures and understanding their dynamics.
NNMs can be identified experimentally through a phase quadrature condition
between the system response and the applied excitation. This paper demonstrates
that this commonly-used quadrature condition can give results that are
significantly different from the true NNM, in particular when the excitation
applied to the system is limited to one input force, as is frequently used in
practice. The system studied is a clamped-clamped cross beam with two
closely-spaced modes. This paper shows that the regions where the quadrature
condition is (in)accurate can be qualitatively captured by analysing transfer
of energy between the modes of the system, leading to a discussion of the
appropriate number of input forces and their locations across the structure.

balance-related condition involving the convex hulls of treatment groups, which

apparent speeds of these components are relatively slow. About two-thirds of
the components have an apparent speed that is consistent (within two-sigma)
with no motion; and some of these components may be stationary patterns whose
apparent speed does not relate to the underlying bulk flow speed. In addition,
a superluminal tail to the apparent speed distribution of the TeV HBLs is
detected for the first time, with eight components in seven sources having a
two-sigma lower limit on the apparent speed exceeding 1c. We combine the data
from these 20 sources with an additional 18 sources from the literature to
analyze the complete apparent speed distribution of all 38 TeV HBLs that have
been studied with VLBI at multiple epochs. The highest two-sigma apparent speed
lower limit considering all sources is 3.6c. This suggests that bulk Lorentz
factors of up to about 4, but probably not much higher, exist in the
parsec-scale radio emitting regions of these sources, consistent with estimates
obtained in the radio by other means such as brightness temperatures. This can
be reconciled with the high Lorentz factors estimated from the high-energy data
if the jet has velocity structures consisting of different emission regions
with different Lorentz factors. In particular, we analyze the current apparent
speed data for the TeV HBLs in the context of a model with a fast central spine

sufficient criteria for an XOR game to have $\omega^* = 1$, and use these
criteria to derive the following results:
  1. An algorithm for symmetric games that decides in polynomial time whether
$\omega^* = 1$ or $\omega^* < 1$, a task that was not previously known to be
decidable, together with a simple tensor-product strategy that achieves value 1
in the former case. The only previous candidate algorithm for this problem was
the Navascu\'{e}s-Pironio-Ac\'{i}n (also known as noncommutative Sum of Squares

  2. A family of games with three players and with $\omega^* < 1$, where it
takes doubly exponential time for the ncSoS algorithm to witness this (in
contrast with our algorithm which runs in polynomial time).
  3. A family of games achieving a bias difference $2(\omega^* - \omega)$
arbitrarily close to the maximum possible value of $1$ (and as a consequence,
achieving an unbounded bias ratio), answering an open question of Bri\""{e}t and
Vidick.
  4. Existence of an unsatisfiable phase for random (non-symmetric) XOR games:
that is, we show that there exists a constant $C_k^{\text{unsat}}$ depending
only on the number $k$ of players, such that a random $k$-XOR game over an
alphabet of size $n$ has $\omega^* < 1$ with high probability when the number
of clauses is above $C_k^{\text{unsat}} n$.
  5. A lower bound of $\Omega(n \log(n)/\log\log(n))$ on the number of levels
in the ncSoS hierarchy required to detect unsatisfiability for most random
3-XOR games. This is in contrast with the classical case where the $n$-th level
of the sum-of-squares hierarchy is equivalent to brute-force enumeration of all
possible solutions.

scalar-valued query function. Although many mechanisms such as the Laplace and
Gaussian mechanisms can be extended to a matrix-valued query function by adding
i.i.d. noise to each element of the matrix, this method is often suboptimal as
it forfeits an opportunity to exploit the structural characteristics typically
associated with matrix analysis. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
differential privacy mechanism called the Matrix-Variate Gaussian (MVG)
mechanism, which adds a matrix-valued noise drawn from a matrix-variate
Gaussian distribution, and we rigorously prove that the MVG mechanism preserves
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy. Furthermore, we introduce the concept
of directional noise made possible by the design of the MVG mechanism.
Directional noise allows the impact of the noise on the utility of the
matrix-valued query function to be moderated. Finally, we experimentally
demonstrate the performance of our mechanism using three matrix-valued queries
on three privacy-sensitive datasets. We find that the MVG mechanism notably
outperforms four previous state-of-the-art approaches, and provides comparable
utility to the non-private baseline.

fused operators---in terms of fused chains of basic operators---are ubiquitous.
These opportunities include (1) fewer materialized intermediates, (2) fewer
scans of input data, and (3) the exploitation of sparsity across chains of
operators. Automatic operator fusion eliminates the need for hand-written fused
operators and significantly improves performance for complex or previously
unseen chains of operations. However, existing fusion heuristics struggle to
find good fusion plans for complex DAGs or hybrid plans of local and
distributed operations. In this paper, we introduce an optimization framework
for systematically reason about fusion plans that considers materialization
points in DAGs, sparsity exploitation, different fusion template types, as well
as local and distributed operations. In detail, we contribute algorithms for
(1) candidate exploration of valid fusion plans, (2) cost-based candidate

optimum number of fog nodes that will be upgraded from the existing nodes. This
paper finds the optimum number of fog nodes for a given total number of
ordinary nodes residing in the area of interest for different channel
conditions. Determining the optimum number of fog nodes is quite beneficial,
because it can strongly affect the SINR, and thus the average data rate and
transmission delay. The numerical results indicate that the average data rate
increases nearly an order of magnitude for an optimized number of fog nodes in
case of shadowing and fading. It is further shown that the optimum number of
fog nodes does not increase in direct proportion to the increase in the total

cryogenic temperature, immersed a strong magnetic field, and coupled to a
low-noise receiver.
  This dissertation reports on the design, commissioning, and first operation

designed to search for CDM axions with masses above $20$ $\mu\mathrm{eV}$. I
also describe the analysis procedure developed to derive limits on axion CDM

cosmologically relevant sensitivity an order of magnitude higher in mass than
any existing direct limits. Second, by incorporating a dilution refrigerator

Debye length to the pore radius. We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of
solutions to the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) system in narrow pore like
geometries and study the influence of the pore geometry and surface charge on
ion transport. The physical properties of real pores motivate the investigation
of distinguished asymptotic limits, in which either the Debye length and pore
radius are comparable or the pore length is very much greater than its radius.
This results in a Quasi-1D PNP model which can be further simplified, in the
physically relevant limit of strong pore wall surface charge, to a fully
one-dimensional model. Favourable comparison is made to the two-dimensional PNP
equations in typical pore geometries. It is also shown that, for physically
realistic parameters, the standard 1D Area Averaged PNP model for ion flow
through a pore is a very poor approximation to the (real) two-dimensional
solution to the PNP equations. This leads us to propose that the Quasi-1D PNP
model derived here, whose computational cost is significantly less than
two-dimensional solution of the PNP equations, should replace the use of the 1D
Area Averaged PNP equations as a tool to investigate ion and current flows in
ion pores.

are increasingly used by organizations that have dedicated wide area networks

the bandwidth needs and improve completion times of point-to-multipoint
transfers. Using a single forwarding tree per transfer, however, leads to poor
performance because the slowest receiver dictates the completion time for all
receivers. Using multiple forwarding trees per transfer alleviates this
concern--the average receiver could finish early; however, if done naively,
bandwidth usage would also increase and it is apriori unclear how best to
partition receivers, how to construct the multiple trees and how to determine
the rate and schedule of flows on these trees. This paper presents QuickCast, a
first solution to these problems. Using simulations on real-world network
topologies, we see that QuickCast can speed up the average receiver's
completion time by as much as $10\times$ while only using $1.04\times$ more
bandwidth; further, the completion time for all receivers also improves by as
much as $1.6\times$ faster at high loads.

Assuming a CP conserving scalar potential, there are a $CP$-even $H_F$ and a

can mix with the standard-model-like Higgs boson, thereby inducing tree-level

imposing several kinematic cuts to reduce the SM main background, we find that
for $m_{H_F}$ about 200-350 GeV, the decay $H_F \to \tau \mu$ might be at the

Recent density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations find that next
nearest neighbor interaction $J_2$ enhances the frustration and leads to a spin
liquid for $J_2/J_1\in (0.08,0.15)$. In addition, DMRG study of a dipolar
Heisenberg model with longer range interactions gives evidence for a spin
liquid at small dipole titling angle $\theta\in[0,10^\circ)$. In both cases,
the putative spin liquid region appears to be small. Here, we show that for the
triangular lattice dipolar Heisenberg model, a robust quantum paramagnetic
phase exists in a surprisingly wide region, $\theta\in [0,54^\circ)$, for
dipoles tilted along the lattice diagonal direction. We obtain the phase
diagram of the model by functional renormalization group (RG) which treats all
magnetic instabilities on equal footing. The quantum paramagnetic phase is
characterized by a smooth continuous flow of vertex functions and spin
susceptibility down to the lowest RG scale, in contrast to the apparent
breakdown of RG flow in phases with stripe or spiral order. Our finding points
to a promising direction to search for quantum spin liquids in ultracold

involve non-linear, degenerate parabolic equations. Their solutions have low
regularity, and therefore lower order schemes are used for the numerical
approximation. Here the backward Euler method is combined with a mixed finite
element method scheme, which results in a stable and locally mass-conservative
scheme. At the same time, at each time step one has to solve a non-linear
algebraic system, for which linear iterations are needed. Finding robust and
convergent ones is particularly challenging here, since both slow and fast
diffusion cases are allowed.
  Commonly used schemes, like Newton and Picard iterations, are defined either
for non-degenerate problems, or after regularising the problem in the case of
degenerate ones. Convergence is guaranteed only if the initial guess is
sufficiently close to the solution, which translates into severe restrictions
on the time step. Here we discuss a linear iterative scheme which builds on the
$L$-scheme, and does not employ any regularisation. We prove its rigourous
convergence, which is obtained for mild restrictions on the time step. Finally,
we give numerical results confirming the theoretical ones, and compare the
behaviour of the scheme with other schemes.

Previous experimental results have shown that the transition of $\chi_4$, when
varying the vibration amplitude, can be either discontinuous or continuous, for
two different values of the height of the box. Exploring the amplitude-height
phase space, a transition line is found, which can be either discontinuous or
continuous, merging at a tricritical point and the continuous branch ends in an

Once the forged email gets in, how email providers warn users? Is the warning
truly effective?
  We answer these questions through end-to-end measurements on 35 popular email
providers (used by billions of users), and extensive user studies (N = 913)
that consist of both simulated and real-world phishing experiments. We have
four key findings. First, most popular email providers have the necessary
protocols to detect spoofing, but still allow forged emails to get into user
inbox (e.g., Yahoo Mail, iCloud, Gmail). Second, once a forged email gets in,
most email providers have no warnings for users, particularly on mobile email
apps. Some providers (e.g., Gmail Inbox) even have misleading UIs that make the
forged email look authentic. Third, a few email providers (9/35) have
implemented visual security cues for unverified emails, which demonstrate a
positive impact to reduce risky user actions. Comparing simulated experiments
with realistic phishing tests, we observe that the impact of security cue is
less significant when users are caught off guard in the real-world setting.

very simple and versatile argument based on divisibility which immediately
yields the universality of the homomorphism order of directed graphs and

Together with density and universality this ""fractal"" property contributes to
the spectacular properties of the homomorphism order. In Chapter 4 we analyze
the phylogenetic information content from a combinatorial point of view by
considering the binary relation on the set of taxa defined by the existence of

into brain models composed of a reduced number of neurons and a simplified

strategies. Taking advantage of the sparse character of brain-like computation,
the event-driven technique could represent a way to carry out efficient
simulation of large-scale Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). The recent Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire with Latency (LIFL) spiking neuron model is event-driven
compatible and exhibits some realistic neuronal features, opening new avenues
for brain modelling. In this paper we introduce FNS, the first LIFL-based
spiking neural network framework, which combines spiking/synaptic neural
modelling with the event-driven approach, allowing us to define heterogeneous
neuron modules and multi-scale connectivity with delayed connections and
plastic synapses. In order to allow multi-thread implementations a novel
parallelization strategy is also introduced. This paper presents mathematical
models, software implementation and simulation routines on which FNS is based.
Finally, a brain subnetwork is modeled on the basis of real brain structural
data, and the resulting simulated activity is compared with associated brain
functional (source-space MEG) data, demonstrating a good matching between the
activity of the model and that of the experimetal data. This work aims to lay
the groundwork for future event-driven based personalised brain models.

of unobserved covariates that can have a significant impact on the measured
response. When these factors are also correlated with the covariate(s) of
interest (i.e. disease status), ignoring them can lead to increased type I
error and spurious false discovery rate estimates. We show that depending on
the strength of this correlation and the informativeness of the observed data
for the latent factors, previously proposed estimators for the effect of the
covariate of interest that attempt to account for unobserved covariates are
asymptotically biased, which corroborates previous practitioners' observations
that these estimators tend to produce inflated test statistics. We then provide
an estimator that corrects the bias and prove it has the same asymptotic
distribution as the ordinary least squares estimator when every covariate is
observed. Lastly, we use previously published DNA methylation data to show our
method can more accurately estimate the direct effect of asthma on methylation
than previously published methods, which underestimate the correlation between
asthma and latent cell type heterogeneity. Our re-analysis shows that the
majority of the variability in methylation due to asthma in those data is
actually mediated through cell composition.

the iron line shape in general, it seems that Janis-Newman-Winicour

cyber-physical attacks on discrete-time distributed multi-agent systems, and
propose a mitigation approach for attacks on sensors and actuators. First, we
show how an attack on a compromised agent can propagate and affect intact
agents that are reachable from it. This is, an attack on a single node
snowballs into a network-wide attack and can even destabilize the entire
system. Moreover, we show that the attacker can bypass the robust $H_{\infty}$
control protocol and make it entirely ineffective in attenuating the effect of
the adversarial input on the system performance. Finally, to overcome
adversarial effects of attacks on sensors and actuators, a distributed adaptive
attack compensator is designed by estimating the normal expected behavior of
agents. The adaptive attack compensator is augmented with the controller and it
is shown that the proposed controller achieves secure consensus in presence of
the attacks on sensors and actuators. This controller does not require to make
any restrictive assumption on the number of agents or agent's neighbors under
direct effect of adversarial input. Moreover, it recovers compromised agents
under actuator attacks and avoids propagation of attacks on sensors without
removing compromised agents. The effectiveness of the proposed controller and
analysis is validated on a network of Sentry autonomous underwater vehicles
subject to attacks under different scenarios.

BaFe$_2$S$_3$ has established the 123-type iron chalcogenides as a novel and

123 series, BaFe$_2$Se$_3$ is an exceptional member, with a magnetic order and
crystalline structure different from all others. Recently, an exciting
experiment reported the emergence of superconductivity in BaFe$_2$Se$_3$ at

unveils a variety of qualitative differences between BaFe$_2$S$_3$ and
BaFe$_2$Se$_3$, including in the latter an unexpected chain of transitions with
increasing pressure. First, by gradually reducing the tilting angle of iron
ladders, the crystalline structure smoothly transforms from Pnma to Cmcm at ~6
GPa. Second, the system becomes metallic at 10.4 GPa. Third, its unique ambient
pressure Block antiferromagnetic ground state is replaced by the more common CX
antiferromagnetic order at ~12 GPa, the same magnetic state of the 123-S
ladder. This transition is found at a pressure very similar to the experimental
superconducting transition. Finally, all magnetic moments vanish at 30 GPa.
This reported theoretical diagram of the complete phase evolution is important
because of the technical challenges to capture many physical properties in
high-pressure experiments. The information obtained in our calculations suggest
different characteristics for superconductivity in BaFe$_2$Se$_3$ and
BaFe$_2$S$_3$: in 123-S pairing occurs when magnetic moments vanish, while in
123-Se the transition region from Block- to CX-type magnetism appears to
catalyze superconductivity. Finally, an additional superconducting dome above

and texture information collectively. In our proposed color descriptor
component, the inter-channel relationship between Hue (H) and Saturation (S)
channels in the HSV color space has been explored which was not done earlier.
We have quantized the H channel into a number of bins and performed the voting
with saturation values and vice versa by following a principle similar to that
of the HOG descriptor, where orientation of the gradient is quantized into a
certain number of bins and voting is done with gradient magnitude. This helps
us to study the nature of variation of saturation with variation in Hue and
nature of variation of Hue with the variation in saturation. The texture
component of our descriptor considers the co-occurrence relationship between
the pixels symmetric about both the diagonals of a 3x3 window. Our work is
inspired from the work done by Dubey et al.[1]. These two components, viz.
color and texture information individually perform better than existing texture
and color descriptors. Moreover, when concatenated the proposed descriptors
provide significant improvement over existing descriptors for content base
color image retrieval. The proposed descriptor has been tested for image
retrieval on five databases, including texture image databases - MIT VisTex

several partial observations (images) of people are available for matching.
However, few studies have provided flexible solutions to identifying a person
in an image containing arbitrary part of the body. In this paper, we propose a
fast and accurate matching method to address this problem. The proposed method
leverages Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) to generate fix-sized spatial
feature maps such that pixel-level features are consistent. To match a pair of
person images of different sizes, a novel method called Deep Spatial feature
Reconstruction (DSR) is further developed to avoid explicit alignment.
Specifically, DSR exploits the reconstructing error from popular dictionary
learning models to calculate the similarity between different spatial feature
maps. In that way, we expect that the proposed FCN can decrease the similarity
of coupled images from different persons and increase that from the same
person. Experimental results on two partial person datasets demonstrate the
efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with several
state-of-the-art partial person re-id approaches. Additionally, DSR achieves
competitive results on a benchmark person dataset Market1501 with 83.58\%

nanoscale axial and a sub-second temporal resolution. However, conventional
MA-TIRF still performs badly in lateral resolution and fail to characterize the

nanoscale axial resolution and the diffraction limited lateral resolution.
Moreover, the previous reconstructions are highly restricted by the efficiency
with the increased amount of illumination angles. Here, we for the first time,
emphasize the lateral super-resolution in the MA-TIRF and exampled by simply
introducing polarization modulation into the illumination procedure. Equipped
with a sparsity and accelerated proximal algorithm, we examine a more precise

PNe with moderate abundance discrepancy factors (ADFs ~ 2-3), which could be an
indication of a tiny fraction of metal-rich inclusions embedded in the nebula
(bi-abundance). In this work, we have constructed photoionization models to
reproduce the optical and infrared observations of the PN PB 8 using a non-LTE
stellar model atmosphere ionizing source. A chemically homogeneous model
initially used cannot predict the optical recombination lines (ORLs). However,
a bi-abundance model provides a better fit to most of the observed ORLs from N
and O ions. The metal-rich inclusions in the bi-abundance model occupy 5.6
percent of the total volume of the nebula, and are roughly 1.7 times cooler and
denser than the mean values of the surrounding nebula. The N/H and O/H
abundance ratios in the metal-rich inclusions are ~ 1.0 and 1.7 dex larger than
the diffuse warm nebula, respectively. To reproduce the Spitzer spectral energy
distribution of PB 8, dust grains with a dust-to-gas ratio of 0.01 (by mass)
were also included. It is found that the presence of metal-rich inclusions can
explain the heavy element ORLs, while a dual-dust chemistry with different
grain species and discrete grain sizes likely produces the infrared continuum
of this PN. This study demonstrates that the bi-abundance hypothesis, which was
examined in a few PNe with large abundance discrepancies (ADFs > 10), could
also be applied to those typical PNe with moderate abundance discrepancies.

invalidates conventional OFDM receivers relying heavily on this orthogonality.

integrate a type of robust linear OFDM channel estimator into the original
GTurbo framework and derive its corresponding extrinsic information to

stellar wind ablation depends upon how well it prevents energy and momentum
exchange with the atmosphere and how well it traps otherwise escaping plasma.
We focus on the former, and provide a formalism for estimating approximate
upper limits on mass, energy, and momentum capture, and use them to constrain
loss rates. Our approach quantifies a competition between the local deflection
of incoming plasma by a planetary magnetic field and the increase in area for
solar wind mass capture provided by this magnetosphere when the wind and
planetary fields incur magnetic reconnection. Solar wind capture can be larger
for a magnetized planet versus an unmagnetized planet with small ionosphere,
even if the rate of energy transfer is less. We find this to be the case
throughout Earth's history since the lunar forming impact-- the likely start of
the geodynamo. Focusing of incoming charged particles near the magnetic poles
can increase the local energy flux for a strong enough planetary field and weak
enough wind, and we find that this may be the case for Earth's future. The
future protective role of Earth's magnetic field would then depend on its
ability to trap outgoing plasma. This competition between increased collection
area and reduced inflow speed from a magnetosphere is likely essential in
determining the net protective role of planetary fields and its importance in
sustaining habitability, and can help explain the current ion loss rates from
Mars, Venus and Earth.

""volume of publications"", ""percentage of publications""), there are two major
topics of this journal while other topics varied over time widely. The
contribution of this study includes: 1. We could group each ""independent"" study
into a meaningful topic, as a small scale experiment verified that this topic
clustering is feasible. 2. This essay reveals the salient research topics and
their trends for the Taiwan journal ""Mainland China Studies"". 3. Various
topical keywords were identified, providing easy access to the past study. 4.
The yearly trends of the identified topics could be viewed as signature of
future research directions.

Moreover, they help us clarify how the Lee-Wick models work. In this paper we
study the fakeon models, that is to say the theories that contain fake and
physical degrees of freedom. We formulate them by (nonanalytically) Wick
rotating their Euclidean versions. We investigate the properties of arbitrary
Feynman diagrams and, among other things, prove that the fakeon models are
perturbatively unitary to all orders. If standard power counting constraints
are fulfilled, the models are also renormalizable. The S matrix is regionwise
analytic. The amplitudes can be continued from the Euclidean region to the
other regions by means of an unambiguous, but nonanalytic, operation, called
average continuation. We compute the average continuation of typical amplitudes
in four, three and two dimensions and show that its predictions agree with
those of the nonanalytic Wick rotation. By reconciling renormalizability and
unitarity in higher-derivative theories, the fakeon models are good candidates
to explain quantum gravity.

elementary profiles are very close to a cosine profile. They can therefore be
considered as valuable surrogates for computing the scattering properties of

an application for antireflection layers and another for 1D quasicrystals (QC).
The proposed S-shaped profiles can be easily manipulated for exploring the
optical properties of smooth QC, a class of photonic devices that adds to the
classical binary-level QC.

written as a product of these squares: $s = X_1^2 X_2^2 \cdots$. The square
root $\sqrt{s}$ of $s$ is the infinite word $X_1 X_2 \cdots$ obtained by

we study these dynamical systems in more detail and compare their properties to

assistance of wireless cache nodes. Specifically, the requests of one file is
modeled as a Poisson point process with finite lifetime, and two downlink
transmission modes are considered: (1) the base station multicasts file
segments to the requesting users and selected cache nodes; (2) the base station
proactively multicasts file segments to the selected cache nodes without
requests from users. Hence the cache nodes with decoded files can help to
offload the traffic upon the next file request via other air interfaces, e.g.
WiFi. Without proactive caching placement, we formulate the downlink traffic
offloading as a Markov decision process with random number of stages, and
propose a revised Bellman's equation to obtain the optimal control policy. In
order to address the prohibitively huge state space, we also introduce a
low-complexity sub-optimal solution based on linear approximation of the value
functions, where the gap between the approximated value functions and the real
ones is bounded analytically. The approximated value functions can be
calculated from analytical expressions given the spatial distribution of
requesting users. Moreover, we propose a learning-based algorithm to evaluate
the approximated value functions for unknown distribution of requesting users.
Finally, a proactive caching placement algorithm is introduced to exploit the
temporal diversity of shadowing effect. It is shown by simulation that the
proposed low-complexity algorithm based on approximated value functions can
significantly reduce the resource consumption at the base station, and the
proactive caching placement can further improve the performance.

cup to disc ratio (CDR) plays an important role in the screening and diagnosis

methods segment them separately, and rely on hand-crafted visual feature from
fundus images. In this paper, we propose a deep learning architecture, named
M-Net, which solves the OD and OC segmentation jointly in a one-stage
multi-label system. The proposed M-Net mainly consists of multi-scale input
layer, U-shape convolutional network, side-output layer, and multi-label loss
function. The multi-scale input layer constructs an image pyramid to achieve
multiple level receptive field sizes. The U-shape convolutional network is
employed as the main body network structure to learn the rich hierarchical
representation, while the side-output layer acts as an early classifier that
produces a companion local prediction map for different scale layers. Finally,
a multi-label loss function is proposed to generate the final segmentation map.
For improving the segmentation performance further, we also introduce the polar
transformation, which provides the representation of the original image in the
polar coordinate system. The experiments show that our M-Net system achieves
state-of-the-art OD and OC segmentation result on ORIGA dataset.
Simultaneously, the proposed method also obtains the satisfactory glaucoma
screening performances with calculated CDR value on both ORIGA and SCES

fission process and it's evolution with excitation energy in the pre-actinide
Hg-Pb region in general is a matter of intense research in recent years. In
particular, a strong ambiguity remains for the neutron shell closed $^{210}$Po
nucleus regarding the role of shell effect in fission around $\approx$ 30 - 40
MeV of excitation energy. Purpose: We have measured the fission fragment mass
distribution of $^{210}$Po populated using fusion of $^{4}$He + $^{206}$Pb at
different excitation energies and compare the result with recent theoretical
predictions as well as with our previous measurement for the same nucleus
populated through a different entrance channel. Mass distribution in the
fission of the neighbouring nuclei $^{213}$At is also studied for comparison.
Methods: Two large area Multi-wire Proportional Counters (MWPC) were used for
complete kinematical measurement of the coincident fission fragments. The time
of flight differences of the coincident fission fragments were used to directly
extract the fission fragment mass distributions. Results: The measured fragment
mass distribution for the reactions $^{4}$He + $^{206}$Pb and $^{4}$He +
$^{209}$Bi were symmetric and the width of the mass distributions were found to
increase monotonically with excitation energy above 36.7 MeV and 32.9 MeV,
respectively, indicating the absence of shell effects at the saddle. However,
in the fission of $^{210}$Po, we find minor deviation from symmetric mass
distributions at the lowest excitation energy (30.8 MeV). Conclusion:
Persistence of shell effect in fission fragment mass distribution of $^{210}$Po
was observed at the excitation energy $\approx$ 31 MeV as predicted by the
theory; at higher excitation energy, however, the present study reaffirms the
absence of any shell correction in the fission of $^{210}$Po.

data is used as the side channel to attack the system. First using a device
like an oscilloscope power traces are collected when the cryptographic device
is doing the cryptographic operation. Then those traces are statistically
analysed using methods such as Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) to derive the
secret key of the system. Being possible to break Advanced Encryption Standard
(AES) in few minutes, power analysis attacks have become a serious security
issue for cryptographic devices such as smart card.
  As the first phase of our project, we build a testbed for doing research on
power analysis attacks. As power analysis is a practical type of attack in
order to do any research, a testbed is the first requirement. Since building a
test bed is a complicated process, having a pre-built testbed would save the
time of future researchers. The second phase of our project is to attack the
latest cryptographic algorithm called Speck which has been released by National
Security Agency (NSA) for use in embedded systems. In spite it has lot of
differences to AES making impossible to directly use the power analysis
approach used for AES, we introduce novel approaches to break Speck in less
than an hour. In the third phase of the project, we select few already
introduced countermeasures and practically attack them on our testbed to do a
comparative analysis. We show that software countermeasures such as random
instruction injection and randomly shuffling S-boxes are good enough for their
simplicity and cost. But we identify the possible threat due to the problem of
generating a good seed for the pseudo-random algorithm running on the
microcontroller. We attempt to address this issue by using a hardware-based
true random generator that amplifies a random electrical signal and samples to
generate a proper seed.

the certificate ecosystem currently undergoes a drastic transformation. Big
steps towards ubiquitous encryption were made, however, on the expense of trust
for authentication of communication partners. Furthermore we describe systemic

of NWFET is essential to design the next generation logic circuits. Compared to
any other process induced variabilities, Metal Gate Granularity (MGG) is of
paramount importance due to its large impact on V T variability. Here, an
analytical model is proposed to estimate V T variability caused by MGG. We
extend our earlier FinFET based MGG model to a cylindrical NWFET by sat-
isfying three additional requirements. First, the gate dielectric layer is
replaced by Silicon of electro-statically equivalent thickness using long
cylinder approxi- mation; Second, metal grains in NWFETs satisfy periodic
boundary condition in azimuthal direction; Third, electrostatics is
analytically solved in cylindri- cal polar coordinates with gate boundary
condition defined by MGG. We show that quantum effects only shift the mean of
the V T distribution without sig- nificant impact on the variability estimated
by our electrostatics-based model. The V T distribution estimated by our model
matches TCAD simulations. The model quantitatively captures grain size
dependence with {\sigma}(V T ) with excellent accuracy (6%error) compared to
stochastic 3D TCAD simulations, which is a significant improvement over the
state-of- the-art model with fails to produce even a qualitative agreement. The
proposed model is 63 times faster compared to commercial TCAD simulations.

out-of-equilibrium time irreversible energy cascade from large to small scales.
In the NSE, the energy transfer is due to the nonlinear terms that are formally
symmetric under time reversal. As for the dissipative term: first it explicitly
breaks time reversibility; second it produces a small-scale sink for the energy
transfer that remains effective even in the limit of vanishing viscosity. As a
result, it is not clear how to disentangle the time irreversibility originating
from the non-equilibrium energy cascade from the explicit time-reversal
symmetry breaking due to the viscous term. To this aim, in this paper we
investigate the properties of the energy transfer in turbulent Shell models by
using a reversible viscous mechanism, avoiding any explicit breaking of the $t
\rightarrow -t$ symmetry. We probe time-irreversibility by studying the
statistics of Lagrangian power, which is found to be asymmetric under time
reversal also in the time-reversible model. This suggests that the turbulent
dynamics converges to a strange attractor where time-reversibility is
spontaneously broken and whose properties are robust for what concerns purely
inertial degrees of freedoms, as verified by the anomalous scaling behavior of
the velocity structure functions.

Fluids",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent reports of surface forces across nanoconfined ionic liquids have
revealed the existence of an anomalously long-ranged interaction apparently of
electrostatic origin. Ionic liquids are viscous and therefore it is important
to inspect rigorously whether the observed repulsive forces are indeed
equilibrium forces or, rather, arise from the viscous force during drainage of
the fluid between two confining surfaces. In this paper we present our direct
measurements of surface forces between mica sheets approaching in the ionic
liquid [C2C1Im][NTf2], exploring three orders of magnitude in approach
velocity. Trajectories are systematically fitted by solving the equation of
motion, allowing us to disentangle the viscous and equilibrium contributions.
First, we find that the drainage obeys classical hydrodynamics with a negative
slip boundary condition in the range of the structural force, implying that a
nm-thick portion of the liquid in the vicinity of the solid surface is composed
of ordered molecules that do not contribute to the flow. Secondly, we show that
a long-range static force must indeed be invoked, in addition to the viscous
force, in order to describe the data quantitatively. This equilibrium
interaction decays exponentially and with decay length is in agreement with the
screening length reported for the same system in previous studies. In those
studies the decay was simply checked to be independent of velocity and measured
at low approach rate, rather than explicitly taking account of viscous effects:
we explain why this gives indistinguishable outcomes for the screening length
by noting that the viscous force is linear to very good approximation over a
wide range of distances.

is designed to simultaneously serve both downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) users in
the presence of half-duplex eavesdroppers (Eves). The problem is to maximize
the minimum (max-min) secrecy rate (SR) among all legitimate users, where the
information signals at the FD-BS are accompanied with artificial noise to
debilitate the Eves' channels. To enhance the max-min SR, a major part of the
power budget should be allocated to serve the users with poor channel
qualities, such as those far from the FD-BS, undermining the SR for other
users, and thus compromising the SR per-user. In addition, the main obstacle in
designing an FD system is due to the self-interference (SI) and co-channel
interference (CCI) among users. We therefore propose an alternative solution,
where the FD-BS uses a fraction of the time block to serve near DL users and
far UL users, and the remaining fractional time to serve other users. The
proposed scheme mitigates the harmful effects of SI, CCI and multiuser
interference, and provides system robustness. The SR optimization problem has a
highly nonconcave and nonsmooth objective, subject to nonconvex constraints.
For the case of perfect channel state information (CSI), we develop a
low-complexity path-following algorithm, which involves only a simple convex
program of moderate dimension at each iteration. We show that our
path-following algorithm guarantees convergence at least to a local optimum.
Then, we extend the path-following algorithm to the cases of partially known
Eves' CSI, where only statistics of CSI for the Eves are known, and worst-case
scenario in which Eves can employ a more advanced linear decoder. The merit of
our proposed approach is further demonstrated by extensive numerical results.

inverse problem, which aims to recover a structured signal from its linear

random measurements. Different from previous studies, in this paper, we
consider convex programs with multiple prior constraints. These programs are
encountered in many cases, for example, when the signal is sparse and its
$\ell_2$ norm is known beforehand, or when the signal is sparse and
non-negative simultaneously. Given such a convex program, to analyze its phase
transition, we introduce a new set and a new cone, called the prior restricted
set and prior restricted cone, respectively. Our results reveal that the phase
transition of a convex problem occurs at the statistical dimension of its prior
restricted cone. Moreover, to apply our theoretical results in practice, we
present two recipes to accurately estimate the statistical dimension of the
prior restricted cone. These two recipes work under different conditions, and
we give a detailed analysis for them. To further illustrate our results, we
apply our theoretical results and the estimation recipes to study the phase

naively apply the bound on the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_L \le 2\pi T/ \hbar$
to this system, it predicts the existence of the bound on temperature (the
lowest temperature) $T \ge \hbar \lambda_L/ 2\pi$ and the system cannot be
taken to be zero temperature when $\hbar \neq 0$. This seems a puzzle because
particle motions in an inverse harmonic potential should be realized without
introducing any temperature but this inequality does not allow it. In this

the thermal radiation of black holes, which are classically non-thermal but
behave as thermal baths quantum mechanically. We also show that the temperature
of the radiation in our model saturates the inequality, and thus, the system
saturates the bound on the Lyapunov exponent, although the system is free and

version of Wald test and has several important advantages that make it very
convenient in practical applications. First, it is well-defined under improper
prior distributions and avoids Jeffrey-Lindley's paradox. Second, it's
asymptotic distribution can be proved to follow the $\chi^2$ distribution so
that the threshold values can be easily calibrated from this distribution.
Third, it's statistical error can be derived using the Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) approach. Fourth, most importantly, it is only based on the posterior
MCMC random samples drawn from the posterior distribution. Hence, it is only
the by-product of the posterior outputs and very easy to compute. In addition,
when the prior information is available, the finite sample theory is derived
for the proposed test statistic. At last, the usefulness of the test is
illustrated with several applications to latent variable models widely used in
economics and finance.

  Usually, sentence representation is associated to the processed language. The
grammar of this language affects how we represent the sentence. To avoid
language-dependent notations, we have to come up with a new representation
which don't use words, but their meanings. This can be done using a lexicon
like wordnet, instead of words we use their synsets. As for syntactic
relations, they have to be universal as much as possible.

has similarities to JSON. It is meant to be minimal, representative and
language-independent syntactic representation. Also, we want it to be readable
and easy to be created. This simplifies developing simple automatic generators
and creating test banks manually. Its benefit is to be used as a medium between
different parts of applications like: text summarization, language translation,
etc. The notation is based on 4 languages: Arabic, English, Franch and
Japanese; and there are some cases where these languages don't agree on one
representation. Also, given the diversity of grammatical structure of different
world languages, this annotation may fail for some languages which allows more
future improvements.

decreasing wavelength in the 1000-2500 \AA{} range, called ""UV upturn"". The
origin of this phenomenon is debated, and its evolution with redshift is poorly
constrained. The observed GALEX FUV-NUV color can be used to probe the UV
upturn approximately to redshift 0.5. AIMS: We provide constraints on the
existence of the UV upturn up to redshift $\sim$ 0.4 in the brightest cluster
galaxies (BCG) located behind the Virgo cluster, using data from the GUViCS
survey. METHODS:We estimate the GALEX far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV) observed
magnitudes for BCGs from the maxBCG catalog in the GUViCS fields. We increase
the number of nonlocal galaxies identified as BCGs with GALEX photometry from a
few tens of galaxies to 166 (64 when restricting this sample to relatively
small error bars). We also estimate a central color within a 20 arcsec
aperture. By using the $r$-band luminosity from the maxBCG catalog, we can
separate blue FUV-NUV due to recent star formation and candidate upturn cases.
We use Lick indices to verify their similarity to redshift 0 upturn cases.
RESULTS: We clearly detect a population of blue FUV-NUV BCGs in the redshift
range 0.10-0.35, vastly improving the existing constraints at these epochs by
increasing the number of galaxies studied, and by exploring a redshift range
with no previous data (beyond 0.2), spanning one more Gyr in the past. These
galaxies bring new constraints that can help distinguish between assumptions
concerning the stellar populations causing the UV upturn phenomenon. The
existence of a large number of UV upturns around redshift 0.25 favors the
existence of a binary channel among the sources proposed in the literature.

truncated expansion over harmonic-oscillator eigenmodes (the Galerkin

observed quasi-integrability as the fact that the finite-mode dynamics always
produces a quasi-discrete power spectrum, with no visible continuous component,
the presence of the latter being a necessary manifestation of ergodicity. This
conclusion remains true when a strong random-field component is added to the

usage efficiency is always a concern, and large bandwidth is required for

under the QoS constraints of URLLC. We first propose a packet delivery
mechanism for URLLC. To reduce the required bandwidth for ensuring queueing
delay, we consider a statistical multiplexing queueing mode, where the packets
to be sent to different devices are waiting in one queue at the base station,
and broadcast mode is adopted in downlink transmission. In this way, downlink
bandwidth is shared among packets of multiple devices. In uplink transmission,
different subchannels are allocated to different devices to avoid strong
interference. Then, we jointly optimize uplink and downlink bandwidth
configuration and delay components to minimize the total bandwidth required to
guarantee the overall packet loss and end-to-end delay, which includes uplink
and downlink transmission delays, queueing delay and backhaul delay. We propose
a two-step method to find the optimal solution. Simulation and numerical
results validate our analysis and show remarkable performance gain by jointly
optimizing uplink and downlink configuration.

structures near physical boundaries. Different from previous contributions in
literature, the current approach constructs a fourth order accurate
approximation to boundary conditions by only using the Jacobian of the flux
function (characteristic information) instead of its successive differentiation
leading to tensors of high ranks in the inverse Lax-Wendroff method.
Technically, data in several ghost cells are constructed with interpolation so
that the interior scheme can be implemented over boundary cells, and
theoretical boundary condition has to be modified properly at intermediate
stages so as to make the two-stage scheme over boundary cells fully consistent
with that over interior cells. This highlights the fact that {\em continuous
boundary conditions only match continuous partial differential equations

melting early in their history. Fractionation during magma-ocean freezing leads
to unstable stratification within the related cumulate layers due to
progressive iron enrichment upward, but the effects of incremental cumulate
overturns during MO crystallization remain to be explored. Here, we use
geodynamic models with a moving-boundary approach to study convection and
mixing within the growing cumulate layer, and thereafter within the fully
crystallized mantle. For fractional crystallization, cumulates are efficiently
stirred due to subsequent incremental overturns, except for strongly
iron-enriched late-stage cumulates, which persist as a stably stratified layer
at the base of the mantle for billions of years. Less extreme crystallization
scenarios can lead to somewhat more subtle stratification. In any case, the
long-term preservation of at least a thin layer of extremely enriched cumulates
with Fe#>0.4, as predicted by all our models, is inconsistent with seismic
constraints. Based on scaling relationships, however, we infer that final-stage
Fe-rich magma-ocean cumulates originally formed near the surface should have
overturned as small diapirs, and hence undergone melting and reaction with the
host rock during sinking. The resulting moderately iron-enriched
metasomatized/hybrid rock assemblages should have accumulated at the base of

on the effect of length polydispersity, which -- in the absence of a field --
is known to produce a percolation threshold that scales with the inverse weight
average of the particle length. Using a model of non-interacting
spherocylinders in conjunction with connectedness percolation theory, we show
that a quadrupolar field always increases the percolation threshold and that
the universal scaling with the inverse weight average no longer holds if the
field couples to the particle length. Instead, the percolation threshold
becomes a function of higher moments of the length distribution, where the
order of the relevant moments crucially depends on the strength and type of
field applied. The theoretical predictions compare well with the results of our
Monte Carlo simulations, which eliminate finite size effects by exploiting the
fact that the universal scaling of the wrapping probability function holds even
in anisotropic systems. Theory and simulation demonstrate that the percolation
threshold of a polydisperse mixture can be lower than that of the individual
components, confirming recent work based on a mapping onto a Bethe lattice as
well as earlier computer simulations involving dipole fields. Our work shows
how the formulation of nanocomposites may be used to compensate for the adverse
effects of aligning fields that are inevitable under practical manufacturing

observe differences in ensembling efficacy under these two methods. Annealed
learning rates are important in general to the training of deep neural network

local optima. While both variants show performance exceeding those of built-in
AI agents of the game, the known stabilizing effects of double-Q learning are

usefulness by showing immediate results early on in agent development, with the
caveat that value overestimation is accelerated in this case. In addition, some
unique behaviors are observed to develop for priority experience replay (PER)

with the required skills and high collaboration compatibility has been
extensively studied. However, existing methods have not considered the specific
collaboration relationships among different team members, i.e., structural
constraints, which are typically needed in practice. In this study, we first
propose a novel graph pattern matching approach for top-k team formation, which
incorporates both structural constraints and capacity bounds. Second, we
formulate and study the dynamic top-k team formation problem due to the growing
need of a dynamic environment. Third, we develop an unified incremental
approach, together with an optimization technique, to handle continuous pattern
and data updates, separately and simultaneously, which has not been explored
before. Finally, using real-life and synthetic data, we conduct an extensive
experimental study to show the effectiveness and efficiency of our graph
pattern matching approach for (dynamic) top-k team formation.

further investigation, replication, re-analysis and follow up research. For
example, in our corpus, the median apparent bug resolution time (elapsed time
from raise to resolve) for Ruby was 4X that for Go and 2.5X for Java. We also
found that patches tend to touch more files for the corpus of strongly typed

from statically typed languages. These findings, if replicated in subsequent

establish an optimal rate of density for the values of polynomials maps in a
number of other natural problems, including the values of linear forms
restricted to suitable quadratic surfaces, and the values of the polynomial map
defined by the generators of the ring of conjugation-invariant polynomials on
$M_3(\C)$.
  These results are instances of a general approach that we develop, which
considers a rational affine algebraic subvariety of Euclidean space, invariant
and homogeneous under an action of a semisimple Lie group $G$. Given a
polynomial map $F$ defined on the Euclidean space which is invariant under a
semisimple subgroup $H$ of the acting group $G$, consider the family of its
translates $F\circ g$ by elements of the group. We study the restriction of
these polynomial functions to the integer points on the variety confined to a
large Euclidean ball. Our main results establish an explicit rate of density
for their values, for generic polynomials in the family. This problem has been
extensively studied before when the polynomials in question are linear, in the
context of classical Diophantine approximation, but very little was known about
it for polynomial of higher degree. We formulate a heuristic pigeonhole lower
bound for the density and an explicit upper bound for it, formulate a
sufficient condition for the coincidence of the lower and upper bounds, and in
a number of natural examples establish that they indeed match. Finally, we also
establish a rate of density for values of homogeneous polynomials on
homogeneous projective varieties.

apply local correlation tracking (LCT) to a two-hour time series on 2011 Nov.
16 of the AIA images to derive horizontal flow velocities of the filament. To
enhance the contrast of the AIA images, noise adaptive fuzzy equalization is
employed, which allows us to identify and quantify counter-streaming flows in
the filament. We detect counter-streaming flows in the filament, which are
visible in the time-lapse movies in all examined AIA wavelength bands. In the
time-lapse movies we see that these persistent flows lasted for at least two
hours. Furthermore, by applying LCT to the images we clearly determine
counter-streaming flows in time series of 171 and 193\AA\ images. In the
304\AA\ wavelength band, we only see minor indications for counter-streaming
flows with LCT, while in the 211\AA\ wavelength band the counter-streaming
flows are not detectable. The average horizontal flows reach mean flow speeds
of 0.5 km/s. The highest horizontal flow speeds are identified in the 171\AA\
band with flow speeds of up to 2.5 km/s. The results are averaged over a time
series of 90 min. Because the LCT sampling window has finite width, a spatial
degradation cannot be avoided leading to lower estimates of the flow velocities
as compared to feature tracking or Doppler measurements. The counter-streaming
flows cover about 15-20% of the whole area of the EUV filament channel and are
located in the central part of the spine. In conclusion, we confirm the
omnipresence of counter-streaming flows also in giant quiet-Sun filaments.

used gas tracers or clump giants. Here, we explore A and F stars as
alternatives: these provide a much denser sampling in the outer disc than gas
tracers and have experienced significantly less velocity scattering than older
clump giants. This first investigation confirms the suitability of A stars in
this role. Our work is based on spectroscopy of $\sim$ 1300
photometrically-selected stars in the red calcium-triplet region, chosen to
mitigate against the effects of interstellar extinction. The stars are located
in two low Galactic latitude sightlines, at longitudes $\ell = 118^{\circ}$,
sampling strong Galactic rotation shear, and $\ell = 178^{\circ}$, near the
Anticentre. With the use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo parameter fitting, stellar
parameters and radial velocities are measured, and distances computed. The
obtained trend of radial velocity with distance is inconsistent with existing
flat or slowly rising rotation laws from gas tracers (Brand & Blitz 1993; Reid
et al. 2014). Instead, our results fit in with those obtained by Huang et al.
(2016) from disc clump giants that favoured rising circular speeds. An
alternative interpretation in terms of spiral arm perturbation is not straight
forward. We assess the role that undetected binaries in the sample and distance
error may have in introducing bias, and show that the former is a minor factor.
The random errors in our trend of circular velocity are within $\pm 5$ km
s$^{-1}$.

non-hydrostatic equations of motion and uses a flexible and accurate radiative
transfer scheme, based on the two-stream and correlated-$k$ approximations, to
calculate the heating rates. In this work we consistently couple a well-tested
Gibbs energy minimisation scheme to solve for the chemical equilibrium
abundances locally in each grid cell for a general set of elemental abundances,
further improving the flexibility and accuracy of the model. As the metallicity
of the atmosphere is increased we find significant changes in the dynamical and
thermal structure, with subsequent implications for the simulated phase curve.
The trends that we find are qualitatively consistent with previous works,
though with quantitative differences. We investigate in detail the effect of
increasing the metallicity by splitting the mechanism into constituents,
involving the mean molecular weight, the heat capacity and the opacities. We
find the opacity effect to be the dominant mechanism in altering the
circulation and thermal structure. This result highlights the importance of
accurately computing the opacities and radiative transfer in 3D GCMs.

taken over all graphs $G$ with $n$ vertices.
  Let $f(n,h) = \Pi_{i}^h a_i$ where $\sum_{i=1}^h a_i = n$ and the $a_i$ are
as equal as possible. Let $g(n,h) = f(n,h) + \sum_{i=1}^h g(a_i,h)$. It is
proved that for almost all graphs $H$ on $h$ vertices it holds that
$i_H(n)=g(n,h)$ for all $n \le 2^{\sqrt{h}}$. More precisely, we define an
explicit graph property ${\cal P}_h$ which, when satisfied by $H$, guarantees
that $i_H(n)=g(n,h)$ for all $n \le 2^{\sqrt{h}}$. It is proved, in particular,
that a random graph on $h$ vertices satisfies ${\cal P}_h$ with probability
$1-o_h(1)$. Furthermore, all extremal $n$-vertex graphs yielding $i_H(n)$ in
the aforementioned range are determined.
  We also prove a stability result. For $H \in {\cal P}_h$ and a graph $G$ with
$n \le 2^{\sqrt{h}}$ vertices satisfying $i_H(G) \ge f(n,h)$, it must be that
$G$ is obtained from a balanced blowup of $H$ by adding some edges inside the
blowup parts.
  The {\em inducibility} of $H$ is $i_H = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}
i_H(n)/\binom{n}{h}$. It is known that $i_H \ge h!/(h^h-h)$ for all graphs $H$
and that a random graph $H$ satisfies almost surely that $i_H \le h^{3\log
h}h!/(h^h-h)$. We improve upon this upper bound almost matching the lower
bound. It is shown that a graph $H$ which satisfies ${\cal P}_h$ has $i_H

quantum computers. Quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics are expected
to benefit from these technological developments. Several quantum simulation
methods are known to prepare a state on a quantum computer and measure the
desired observables. The most resource economic procedure is the variational
quantum eigensolver (VQE), which has traditionally employed unitary coupled
cluster as the ansatz to approximate ground states of many-body fermionic
Hamiltonians. A significant caveat of the method is that the initial state of
the procedure is a single reference product state with no entanglement
extracted from a classical Hartree-Fock calculation. In this work, we propose
to improve the method by initializing the algorithm with a more general
fermionic Gaussian state, an idea borrowed from the field of nuclear physics.
We show how this Gaussian reference state can be prepared with a linear-depth
circuit of quantum matchgates. By augmenting the set of available gates with
nearest-neighbor phase coupling, we generate a low-depth circuit ansatz that
can accurately prepare the ground state of correlated fermionic systems. This
extends the range of applicability of the VQE to systems with strong pairing
correlations such as superconductors, atomic nuclei, and topological materials.

Rotation invariants are useful tools for such purposes, allowing to extract

have been characterized in terms of interevent times and correlations between
interevent times. The inhomogeneities of interevent times have been extensively
studied, while the correlations between interevent times, often called
correlated bursts, are far from being fully understood. For measuring the
correlated bursts, two relevant approaches were suggested, i.e., memory
coefficient and burst size distribution. Here a burst size denotes the number
of events in a bursty train detected for a given time window. Empirical
analyses have revealed that the larger memory coefficient tends to be
associated with the heavier tail of burst size distribution. In particular,
empirical findings in human activities appear inconsistent, such that the
memory coefficient is close to $0$, while burst size distributions follow a
power law. In order to comprehend these observations, by assuming the
conditional independence between consecutive interevent times, we derive the
analytical form of the memory coefficient as a function of parameters
describing interevent time and burst size distributions. Our analytical result
can explain the general tendency of the larger memory coefficient being
associated with the heavier tail of burst size distribution. We also find that
the apparently inconsistent observations in human activities are compatible
with each other, indicating that the memory coefficient has limits to measure
the correlated bursts.

population has adaptive dynamic synaptic strengths governed by the inhibitory
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (iSTDP). In previous works without iSTDP,
fast sparsely synchronized rhythms, associated with diverse cognitive
functions, were found to appear in a range of large noise intensities for fixed
strong synaptic inhibition strengths. Here, we investigate the effect of iSTDP
on fast sparse synchronization (FSS) by varying the noise intensity $D$. We
employ an asymmetric anti-Hebbian time window for the iSTDP update rule [which
is in contrast to the Hebbian time window for the excitatory STDP (eSTDP)].
Depending on values of $D$, population-averaged values of saturated synaptic
inhibition strengths are potentiated [long-term potentiation (LTP)] or
depressed [long-term depression (LTD)] in comparison with the initial mean
value, and dispersions from the mean values of LTP/LTD are much increased when
compared with the initial dispersion, independently of $D$. In most cases of

dispersion, good FSS (with higher spiking measure) is found to get better via
LTD, while bad FSS (with lower spiking measure) is found to get worse via LTP.
This kind of Matthew effect in inhibitory synaptic plasticity is in contrast to
that in excitatory synaptic plasticity where good (bad) synchronization gets
better (worse) via LTP (LTD). Emergences of LTD and LTP of synaptic inhibition
strengths are intensively investigated via a microscopic method based on the
distributions of time delays between the pre- and the post-synaptic spike
times. Furthermore, we also investigate the effects of network architecture on
FSS by changing the rewiring probability $p$ of the SWN in the presence of
iSTDP.

the world DIS data of proton and deuteron targets, if the uncertainties caused
by model-dependent corrections are taken into account. Furthermore, our
obtained $F_2^{\rm n}/F_{2}^{\rm p}$ ratio basically agrees with BONuS
experimental results after considering both the contamination from the nucleon

However, when fewer electrodes are used, less spatial information is available,
making it harder to detect artifacts. In this study, we investigate the
performance of a deep learning algorithm, CNN-LSTM, on several channel
configurations. Each configuration was designed to minimize the amount of

reduced number of channels ranging from 8 to 20 achieved sensitivities between

continuum and solve differential equations or we can treat it discretely and
solve massive N-body problems. The differential equations produced by
meaningful problems can be extremely difficult to formulate and much more
difficult to solve, if not impossible. Hence, in most cases, the resultant
differential equation is discretized and approximated numerically. We know that
matter is discrete, so why all the circular work of taking a discrete
phenomenon, putting a continuous model on it, and then discretizing this
continuous model into something that is solvable? We do this because the sheer
number of particles that make up any meaningful amount of matter is daunting
and impossible to handle even with todays largest supercomputer. One discrete
approach to deal with this problem is to group large numbers of particles
together and treat them as individual units called quasimolecules. Then pray
that the bulk behavior of this model behaves in a similar manner to the matter
being studied. The mathematical skills needed to set up such problems are much
more attainable than those needed to set up the differential equation, but the
N-body problem that ensues usually requires a supercomputer to propagate it
through time. Until recently the cost of such machines made this approach out
of the financial reach of all except the privileged few. But, thanks to the
gaming industry and recent advances in the ease to which one can program modern
graphics processing units (GPUs), this is no longer true. Supercomputing has
finally reached the masses. Here we use a simple example of a vibrating string

  structure",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The spin current can result in a spin-transfer torque in the
normal-metal(NM)|ferromagnetic-insulator(FMI) or
normal-metal(NM)|ferromagnetic-metal(FMM) bilayer. In the earlier study on this
issue, the spin relaxations were ignored or introduced phenomenologically. In
this paper, considering the FMM or FMI with spin relaxations described by a
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we derive an effective spin-transfer torque and an
effective spin mixing conductance in the non-Hermitian bilayer. The dependence
of the effective spin mixing conductance on the system parameters (such as
insulating gap, \textit{s-d} coupling, and layer thickness) as well as the
relations between the real part and the imaginary part of the effective spin
mixing conductance are given and discussed. We find that the effective spin
mixing conductance can be enhanced in the non-Hermitian system. This provides
us with the possibility to enhance the spin mixing conductance.

probabilistic nature of human iris templates. This model is an Ising model in
which the values at certain lattice points are held fixed throughout Ising
model evolution. Using this we show how to reconstruct the full iris template
from partial information, and we show that about 1/6 of the given template is
needed to recover almost all information content of the original one in the
sense that the resulting Hamming distance is well within the range to assert
correctly the identity of the subject. This leads us to propose the concept of
effective statistical degree of freedom of iris templates and show it is about
1/6 of the total number of bits. In particular, for a template of $2048$ bits,
its effective statistical degree of freedom is about $342$ bits, which
coincides very well with the degree of freedom computed by the completely
different method proposed by Daugman.

treatment for scattering. The weighted delta-tracking routine adds survival
biasing to normal delta-tracking, improving problem figure of merit. In the
original formulation of this method, only absorption events were considered. We
have expanded the method to include scattering and investigated the method's
effectiveness with two test cases: a pressurized water reactor pin cell and a
fast reactor pin cell. We compare the figure of merit for calculating infinite
flux and total cross-section while incrementally changing the amount of
weighted delta-tracking used. We find that this new WDT routine has strong
potential to improve the efficiency of fast reactor calculations, and may be
useful for light water reactor calculations.

demonstrated. The PA sensor is a standalone system controlled by a
Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The PA cell has been designed for flow
noise immunity using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. The aim of
the CFD analysis was to investigate and minimize the influence of the gas
distribution and the flow noise on the PA signal. PA measurements were
conducted at different flow rates by exciting molecular C-H stretch vibrational
bands of hexane (C$_6$H$_{14}$) and decane (C$_{10}$H$_{22}$) molecules in
clean air at 2950 cm$^{-1}$ (3.38 $\mu$m) with a custom made mid-infrared
interband cascade laser (ICL). We observe a (1$\sigma$, standard deviation)
sensitivity of 0.4 $\pm0.1$ ppb (nmol/mol) for hexane in clean air at flow
rates up to 1.7 L/min, corresponding to a normalized noise equivalent
absorption (NNEA) coefficient of 2.5$\times 10^{-9}$ W cm$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$,
demonstrating high sensitivity and fast real-time gas analysis. An Allan
deviation analysis for decane shows that the detection limit at optimum
integration time is 0.25 ppbV (nmol/mol).
