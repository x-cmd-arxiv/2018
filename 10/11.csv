data generated every day. Biological data is also growing in terms of the
quantity and quality of data considerably. Despite the attempts for building a
uniform platform to handle data management in Plant Science, researchers are
facing the challenge of not only accessing and integrating data stored in
heterogeneous data sources but also representing the implicit and explicit
domain knowledge based on the available plant genomic and phenomic data.
Ontologies provide a framework for describing the structures and vocabularies
to support the semantics of information and facilitate automated reasoning and
knowledge discovery. In this paper, we focus on building an ontology for
Arabidopsis Thaliana in Plant Science domain. The aim of this study is to
provide a conceptual model of Arabidopsis Thaliana as a reference plant for
botany and other plant sciences, including concepts and their relationships.

explosion of huge data sets being captured and recorded in different fields,
but also given rise to concerns the security and protection of data storage,
transmission, processing, and access to data. The blockchain is a distributed
ledger that records transactions in a secure, flexible, verifiable and
permanent way. Transactions in a blockchain can be an exchange of an asset, the
execution of the terms of a smart contract, or an update to a record. In this
paper, we have developed a blockchain access control ecosystem that gives asset
owners the sovereign right to effectively manage access control of large data
sets and protect against data breaches. The Linux Foundation's Hyperledger
Fabric blockchain is used to run the business network while the Hyperledger
composer tool is used to implement the smart contracts or transaction

systems. As a consequence, it is increasingly difficult to predict, explain,
let alone optimize the performance of software running on such
microarchitectures. As a basis for performance predictions and optimizations,
we would need faithful models of their behavior, which are, unfortunately,
seldom available.
  In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a tool to
construct faithful models of the latency, throughput, and port usage of x86
instructions. To this end, we first discuss common notions of instruction
throughput and port usage, and introduce a more precise definition of latency
that, in contrast to previous definitions, considers dependencies between
different pairs of input and output operands. We then develop novel algorithms
to infer the latency, throughput, and port usage based on
automatically-generated microbenchmarks that are more accurate and precise than
existing work.
  To facilitate the rapid construction of optimizing compilers and tools for
performance prediction, the output of our tool is provided in a
machine-readable format. We provide experimental results for processors of all
generations of Intel's Core architecture, i.e., from Nehalem to Coffee Lake,
and discuss various cases where the output of our tool differs considerably

repair for any $t~(t\!>\!1)$ node failures in a cooperative way. In particular,
an MSCR (minimum storage cooperative regenerating) code retains the same
storage overhead as an $(n,k)$ MDS code. Suppose each node stores $\alpha$
symbols which indicates the sub-packetization level of the code. A scalar MSCR
code attains the minimum sub-packetization, i.e., $\alpha=d-k+t$. By now, all
existing constructions of scalar MSCR codes restrict to very special
parameters, eg. $d=k$ or $k=2$, etc. In a recent work, Ye and Barg construct
MSCR codes for all $n,k,d,t$, however, their construction needs
$\alpha\approx{\rm exp}(n^t)$ which is almost infeasible in practice. In this
paper, we give an explicit construction of scalar MSCR codes for all $d\geq
\max\{2k-1-t,k\}$, which covers all possible parameters except the case of
$k\leq d\leq 2k-2-t$ when $k<2k-1-t$. Moreover, as a complementary result, for
$k<d<2k-2-t$ we prove the nonexistence of linear scalar MSCR codes that have
invariant repair spaces. Our construction and most of the previous scalar MSCR
codes all have invariant repair spaces and this property is appealing in
practice because of convenient repair. As a result, this work presents an
almost full description of linear scalar MSCR codes.

abundances are good proxies of planetary abundances, but only for refractory
elements. This is particularly true for terrestrial planets, as evidenced by
the relative differences in bulk chemical composition between the Sun and the
Earth and other inner solar system bodies. The elemental abundances of a planet
host star must therefore be devolatilised in order to correctly represent the
bulk chemical composition of its terrestrial planets. Furthermore, nickel and
light elements make an important contribution alongside iron to the core of
terrestrial planets. We therefore adopt an extended chemical network of the
core, constrained by an Fe/Ni ratio of 18 $\pm$ 4 (by number). By applying
these constraints to the Sun, our modelling reproduces the composition of the
mantle and core, as well as the core mass fraction of the Earth. We also apply
our modelling to four exoplanet host stars with precisely measured elemental

would also host terrestrial planets in their habitable zone, we find that such

community detection has been widely used. However, the fundamental question of
whether communities exist or not in an observed hypergraph still remains
unresolved. The aim of the present paper is to tackle this important problem.
Specifically, we study when a hypergraph with community structure can be
successfully distinguished from its Erd\""{o}s-Renyi counterpart, and propose
concrete test statistics based on hypergraph cycles when the models are
distinguishable. Our contributions are summarized as follows. For uniform
hypergraphs, we show that successful testing is always impossible when average
degree tends to zero, might be possible when average degree is bounded, and is
possible when average degree is growing. We obtain asymptotic distributions of
the proposed test statistics and analyze their power. Our results for growing
degree case are further extended to nonuniform hypergraphs in which a new test
involving both edge and hyperedge information is proposed. The novel aspect of
our new test is that it is provably more powerful than the classic test
involving only edge information. Simulation and real data analysis support our
theoretical findings. The proofs rely on Janson's contiguity theory
(\cite{J95}) and a high-moments driven asymptotic normality result by Gao and

formalism for building covariance functions for multi-output Gaussian
processes. The non-linearity is introduced via Volterra series, one series per
each output. We provide closed-form expressions for the mean function and the
covariance function of the approximated Gaussian process at the output of the
Volterra series. The mean function and covariance function for the joint
Gaussian process are derived using formulae for the product moments of Gaussian

classical process convolution approach in one synthetic dataset and two real

Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_{4+{\delta}}$ that, in combination with prior data,
provide crucial links between the normal and superconducting states and between
the electron- and hole-doped parts of the phase diagram. The characteristics of
the normal state (magnetoresistivity, quantum oscillations, and Hall

upper critical field) consistently indicate two-band (electron and hole)
features and clearly point to hole-pocket-driven superconductivity in these

been placed on models that use audio features in building well-performing

model that utilizes text data and audio signals simultaneously to obtain a
better understanding of speech data. As emotional dialogue is composed of sound
and spoken content, our model encodes the information from audio and text
sequences using dual recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and then combines the
information from these sources to predict the emotion class. This architecture
analyzes speech data from the signal level to the language level, and it thus
utilizes the information within the data more comprehensively than models that
focus on audio features. Extensive experiments are conducted to investigate the
efficacy and properties of the proposed model. Our proposed model outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods in assigning data to one of four emotion
categories (i.e., angry, happy, sad and neutral) when the model is applied to
the IEMOCAP dataset, as reflected by accuracies ranging from 68.8% to 71.8%.

a regime in which current flows along the concentration gradient, a phenomenon
which is known in the literature as \textit{uphill diffusion}. The model we
consider here is a version of that proposed in [G. B. Giacomin, J. L. Lebowitz,
Phase segregation dynamics in particle system with long range interactions,
Journal of Statistical Physics 87(1) (1997): 37-61], which is the continuous
mesoscopic limit of a $1d$ discrete Ising chain with a Kac potential. The
magnetization profile lies in the interval
$\left[-\varepsilon^{-1},\varepsilon^{-1}\right]$, $\varepsilon>0$, staying in
contact at the boundaries with infinite reservoirs of fixed magnetization
$\pm\mu$, $\mu\in(m^*\left(\beta\right),1)$, where
$m^*\left(\beta\right)=\sqrt{1-1/\beta}$, $\beta>1$ representing the inverse
temperature. At last, an external field of Heaviside-type of intensity
$\kappa>0$ is introduced. According to the axiomatic non-equilibrium theory, we
derive from the mesoscopic free energy functional the corresponding stationary
equation and prove the existence of a solution, which is antisymmetric with
respect to the origin and discontinuous in $x=0$, provided $\varepsilon$ is
small enough. When $\mu$ is metastable, the current is positive and bounded
from below by a positive constant independent of $\kappa$, this meaning that
both phase transition as well as external field contributes to uphill
diffusion, which is a regime that actually survives when the external bias is
removed.

homogeneous one-zone synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) leptonic model. The

resulting in a well-constrained combination of values providing a good

bias between them. Multi-task learning is inherently a multi-objective problem
because different tasks may conflict, necessitating a trade-off. A common
compromise is to optimize a proxy objective that minimizes a weighted linear
combination of per-task losses. However, this workaround is only valid when the
tasks do not compete, which is rarely the case. In this paper, we explicitly
cast multi-task learning as multi-objective optimization, with the overall
objective of finding a Pareto optimal solution. To this end, we use algorithms
developed in the gradient-based multi-objective optimization literature. These
algorithms are not directly applicable to large-scale learning problems since
they scale poorly with the dimensionality of the gradients and the number of
tasks. We therefore propose an upper bound for the multi-objective loss and
show that it can be optimized efficiently. We further prove that optimizing
this upper bound yields a Pareto optimal solution under realistic assumptions.
We apply our method to a variety of multi-task deep learning problems including
digit classification, scene understanding (joint semantic segmentation,
instance segmentation, and depth estimation), and multi-label classification.
Our method produces higher-performing models than recent multi-task learning
formulations or per-task training.

used in stellar evolution codes, and concluded that three-dimensional (3D)
fluid dynamical simulations were needed to clarify several important issues. We
have critically explored the limitations of the numerical methods and conclude
that they are approaching the required accuracy. Implicit large eddy
simulations (ILES) automatically connect large scale turbulence to a Kolmogorov
cascade below the grid scale, allowing turbulent boundary layers to remove
singularities that appear in the theory. Interactions between coherent
structures give multi-modal behavior, driving intermittency and fluctuations.
Reynolds averaging (RA) allows us to abstract the essential features of this
dynamical behavior of boundaries which are appropriate to stellar evolution,
and consider how they relate static boundary conditions (Richardson,
Schwarzschild or Ledoux). We clarify several questions concerning when and why
MLT works, and does not work, using both analytical theory and 3D high
resolution numerical simulations. The composition gradients and boundary layer
structure which are produced by our simulations suggest a self-consistent
approach to boundary layers, removing the need for ad hoc procedures for
'convective overshooting' and `semi-convection'. In a companion paper we
quantify the adequacy of our numerical resolution, determine of the length
scale of dissipation (the `mixing length') without astronomical calibration,
quantify agreement with the four-fifths law of Kolmogorov for weak
stratification, and extend MLT to deal with strong stratification.

recast as an exterior differential system so as to leverage the isovector

to traditional symmetry analysis approaches are revealed through its use in the
context of a 2nd order PDE. In this context, various material properties
appearing in the mathematical model (e.g., a diffusion coefficient and

of this work is thus the determination of analytic material property functions

multitasking has become a way of life for most knowledge workers, our current
understanding of how users use window management features to switch between
multiple tasks---which may comprise multiple application windows---is limited.
In this paper, we present a study providing an in-depth analysis of how task
switching is supported in Windows 7. As part of analysis, we developed an
interface-agnostic classification of common task switching operations supported
by window managers which can be used to quantify the time spent on each
constituting action. Our study shows that task switching is a time intensive
activity and highlights the dominant actions that contribute to task switch
time. Furthermore, our classification highlights the specific operations that
are optimized by more recent and experimental window managers and allows
identifying opportunities for design that could further reduce the overhead of
switching between tasks.

interstellar medium (possibly over different epochs of enhanced activity).
Cooler shock-heated gas is likely the origin also of the optical bubble and
lobes near the X-ray structure, detected in images from the Hubble Space

region with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, and discovered an elongated

Adopting a simple illustrative scenario in which the DM state results from the

higher order corrections to the scalar effective operator contributions to
$\sigma_{\rm SI}$, stemming from both triangle and box diagrams involving the
SM and dark sector fields. It is observed that in a significant region of the
singlet-doublet model-space, the one-loop corrections ``unblind'' the

$\mathcal{O}(1)$ Yukawa couplings. Furthermore, we find that there always
exists a new SI blind spot at the next-to-leading order, which is
perturbatively shifted from the leading order one in the singlet-doublet mass
parameters. For comparison, we also present the tree-level spin-dependent
scattering cross-sections near the SI blind-spot region, that could lead to a
larger signal. Our results can be mapped to the blind-spot scenario for

galaxies according to their SFRs relative to the main sequence. We find that
the AGN fraction is significantly elevated for galaxies that are still
star-forming but with SFRs below the main sequence, indicating further
triggering mechanisms enhance AGN activity within these sub-main-sequence

maximum energy MSE of 2.3x10$^{-7}$ was predicted. This method demonstrates a
significant computational speedup, which has the potential for significant
computational savings for larger compositional design spaces.

cyclic evolution depending on the joint photonic state of the cavities, which
produces a conditional geometric phase. We first realize phase gates for

continuous-variable-based quantum computation. Then we use this geometric

still unknown. Large fractions of dense molecular gas might provide part of the
explanation, but there are few observational constraints on the amount of dense
gas in high-z systems dominated by star formation. We present the results of
our ALMA program targeting dense-gas tracers (HCN(5-4), HCO+(5-4), and
HNC(5-4)) in 5 strongly lensed galaxies from the SPT SMG sample. We detected
two of these lines (SNR>5) in SPT-125-47 at z=2.51 and tentatively detected all
three (SNR~3) in SPT0551-50 at z=3.16. Since a significant fraction of our
target lines is not detected, we developed a statistical method to derive
unbiased mean properties taking into account both detections and
non-detections. On average, the HCN(5-4) and HCO+(5-4) luminosities of our
sources are a factor of ~1.7 fainter than expected, based on the local
L'HCN(5-4)-LIR relation, but this offset corresponds to only ~2 sigma. We find
that both the HCO+/HCN and HNC/HCN flux ratios are compatible with unity. The
first ratio is expected for PDRs while the second is consistent with PDRs or
XDRs and/or mid-IR pumping of HNC. Our sources are at the high end of the local
relation between the star formation efficiency, determined using the LIR/[CI]
and LIR/CO ratios, and the dense gas fraction, estimated using the HCN/[CI] and
HCN/CO ratios. In SPT0125-47, we found that the velocity profiles of the lines
tracing dense (HCN, HCO+) and lower-density (CO, [CI]) gas are similar. In
addition to these lines, we obtained one robust and one tentative detection of
13CO(4-3) and found an average I12CO(4-3)/I13CO(4-3) flux ratio of
26.1$_{-3.5}^{+4.5}$, indicating a young but not pristine interstellar medium.
We argue that the combination of large and slightly enriched gas reservoirs and
high dense-gas fractions could explain the prodigious star formation in these
systems.

However, there exist relations among crystal operators that are not implied by

posets, we use poset topology to study them. Using the lexicographic discrete
Morse functions of Babson and Hersh, we relate the M\""obius function of a given
interval in a crystal poset of simply laced or doubly laced type to the types
of relations that can occur among crystal operators within this interval.
  For a crystal of a highest weight representation of finite classical Cartan
type, we show that whenever there exists an interval whose M\""obius function is
not equal to -1, 0, or 1, there must be a relation among crystal operators
within this interval not implied by Stembridge or Sternberg relations. As an
example of an application, this yields relations among crystal operators in

structure of Sternberg relations in the doubly laced case, we prove that

spatially modulated to obtain a diatomic configuration, and to produce a
non-trivial interface by breaking spatial inversion symmetry. For small
amplitudes of motion, the interactions are approximately linear, and the system
supports topologically protected interface modes at frequencies inside the bulk

the bulk bands. The resulting edge-to-bulk transition causes the extinction of
the topologically protected interface mode and extends it to the entire length

supernova ('mono-enriched'). However, recent numerical simulations show that
the first stars form in small clusters. Consequently, we expect several

We analyse seven recently observed EMP stars from the TOPoS survey by applying

bow-tie structures, core-periphery structures and bipartite structures. Here we

2) just between the (empty) layers of a bipartite network. From a technical
point of view, this is achieved by employing a multinomial hypergeometric

the latter case, this allows a p-value to be assigned to any given

report the results of its application to several real-world networks, including

fine-grained and stable measure of system equivalence than crisp notions of
bisimilarity. They correlate strongly to quantitative probabilistic logics, and
in fact the distance induced by a probabilistic modal logic taking values in
the real unit interval has been shown to coincide with behavioural distance.
For probabilistic systems, probabilistic modal logic thus plays an analogous
role to that of Hennessy-Milner logic on classical labelled transition systems.
In the quantitative setting, invariance of modal logic under bisimilarity
becomes non-expansivity of formula evaluation w.r.t. behavioural distance. In
the present paper, we provide a characterization of the expressive power of
probabilistic modal logic based on this observation: We prove a probabilistic
analogue of the classical van Benthem theorem, which states that modal logic is
precisely the bisimulation-invariant fragment of first-order logic.
Specifically, we show that quantitative probabilistic modal logic lies dense in
the bisimulation-invariant fragment, in the indicated sense of non-expansive
formula evaluation, of quantitative probabilistic first-order logic; more
precisely, bisimulation-invariant first-order formulas are approximable by
modal formulas of bounded rank.

types, e.g. carbon and nitrogen, each represented in the environment by
multiple metabolites. We demonstrate that our model has an exponentially large
number of potential stable states realized for different environmental
parameters. Using game theoretical methods adapted from the stable marriage
problem we predict all of these states based only on ranked lists of
competitive abilities of species for each of the nutrients. We show that for
every set of nutrient influxes, several mutually uninvadable stable states are
generally feasible and we distinguish them based upon their dynamic stability.
We further explore an intricate network of discontinuous transitions (regime
shifts) between these alternative states both in the course of community
assembly, or upon changes of nutrient influxes.

Holmes","Buckling of geometrically confined shells","11 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the periodic buckling patterns that emerge when elastic shells are
subjected to geometric confinement. Residual swelling provides access to range
of shapes (saddles, rolled sheets, cylinders, and spherical sections) which
vary in their extrinsic and intrinsic curvatures. Our experimental and
numerical data show that when these structures are radially confined, a single
geometric parameter -- the ratio of the total shell radius to the amount of
unconstrained material -- predicts the number of lobes formed. We then
generalize our model to account for a relaxation of the in-plane constraint by
interpreting this parameter as an effective foundation stiffness.
Experimentally, we show that reducing the transverse confinement of saddles
causes the lobe number to decrease according to our effective stiffness model.
Hence, one geometric parameter captures the wave number through a wide range of
radial and transverse confinement, connecting the shell shape to the shape of
the boundary that confines it. We expect these results to be relevant for an
expanse of shell shapes, and thus apply to the design of shape--shifting
materials and the swelling and growth of soft structures.

networks has focused on a student's centrality to predict academic performance.
And even though a growing amount of sociological literature has supported that
academic success is contagious, identifying central students in the network
alone does not capture how peer interactions facilitate the spread of academic
success throughout the network. Consequently, we propose novel predictors that
treat academic success as a contagion by identifying a student's learning
community, consisting of the peers that are most likely to influence a
student's performance in a course. We evaluate the importance of these learning
communities by predicting academic outcomes in an introductory college
statistics course with 103 students. In particular, we observe that by
including these learning community predictors, the resulting model is 68 times
more likely to be the correct model than the current state-of-the-art
centrality network models in the literature.

the CARMENES spectrograph visible channel revealed a much weaker signal at 9
days which also appeared to vary chromatically and temporally leading to the
conclusion that the origin of the 9 day signal was more likely to be related to
stellar activity than to being planetary. Here we conduct a detailed
re-analysis of all available RV time-series, including a set of 31 previously
unpublished HARPS measurements, to investigate the effects of time-sampling and
of simultaneous modelling of planetary + activity signals on the existence and
origin of the curious 9 day signal. We conclude that the 9 day signal is real
and was initially seen to be suppressed in the CARMENES data due to a small
number of anomalous measurements, although the exact cause of these anomalies
remains unknown. Investigation of the signal's evolution in time, with
wavelength, and detailed model comparison reveals that the 9 day signal is most
likely planetary in nature. By this analysis, we reconcile the conflicting
HARPS and CARMENES results and measure precise and self-consistent planet

useful because it allows for formal statistical tests of both nested and
non-nested models. However, only the test of non-nested models has been applied
in the context of IRT models to date. After summarizing the statistical theory
underlying the tests, we investigate the performance of all three distinct
Vuong tests in the context of IRT models using simulation studies and real
data. In the non-nested case we observed that the tests can reliably
distinguish between the graded response model and the generalized partial
credit model. In the nested case, we observed that the tests typically perform
as well as or sometimes better than the traditional likelihood ratio test.
Based on these results, we argue that Vuong's approach provides a useful set of
tools for researchers and practitioners to effectively compare competing nested

approaches that must simultaneously evolve both (actuated) body and brain.
Exploration fidelity is emphasised in areas of the robot most likely to benefit
from shape optimisation, whilst exploiting existing robot structure and
control. Our approach uses a Genetic Algorithm to optimise collections of
Bezier splines that together define the shape of a legged robot's tibia, and
leg performance is evaluated in parallel in a high-fidelity simulator. The leg
is represented in the simulator as 3D-printable file, and as such can be
readily instantiated in reality. Provisional experiments in three distinct
environments show the evolution of environment-specific leg structures that are
both high-performing and notably different to those evolved in the other
environments. This proof-of-concept represents an important step towards the
environment-dependent optimisation of performance-critical components for a
range of ubiquitous, standard, and already-capable robots that can carry out a

Gran Telescopio Canarias (La Palma, Spain) reveals that this system is beyond
the Local Group and is mainly composed of old stars. The absence of young stars
and HI emission in the ALFALFA survey are typical of quenched dwarf galaxies.
Our photometry suggests a distance modulus for this galaxy of (m-M)=27.6 +/-
0.2 (3.3 Mpc), although this distance cannot yet be established securely owing
to the crowding effects in our color--magnitude diagram. At this distance,
Donatiello I's absolute magnitude (M_v =-8.3), surface brightness (mu_v=26.5

Performance of Zest is compared against performance of random modules of (GCC's

of more than 10.

status of ecosystems. The respective indicators are based on the taxonomic
composition of biological communities of interest, currently estimated through
the proportions computed from sampling multivariate counts. In this work we
present a novel method able to work with only one sample to estimate the
taxonomic composition when the data are affected by overdispersion. The
presence of overdispersion in taxonomic counts may be the result of significant
environmental factors which are often unobservable but influence communities.
Following the empirical Bayes approach, we combine a Bayesian model with the
marginal likelihood method to jointly estimate the taxonomic proportions and
the level of overdispersion from one sample of multivariate counts. Our
proposal is compared to the classical maximum likelihood method in an extensive
simulation study with different realistic scenarios. An application to real
data from aquatic biomonitoring is also presented. In both the simulation study
and the real data application, we consider communities characterized by a large
number of taxonomic categories, such as aquatic macroinvertebrates or bacteria
which are often overdispersed. The applicative results demonstrate an overall
superiority of the empirical Bayes method in almost all examined cases, for
both assessments of diversity and similarity. We would recommend practitioners
in biomonitoring to use the proposed approach in addition to the traditional
procedures. The empirical Bayes estimation allows to better control the error
propagation due to the presence of overdispersion in biological data, with a
more efficient managerial decision making.

supplies of rare earth metals and supplying resources in space, such as water.
Existing research on asteroid mining has mainly looked into its economic
viability, technological feasibility, cartography of asteroids, and legal
aspects. More recently, potential environmental benefits for asteroid mining
have been considered. However, no quantitative estimate of these benefits has
been given. This paper attempts to determine if and under which conditions
asteroid mining would have environmental benefits, compared to either
Earth-based mining or launching equipment and resources into space. We focus on
two cases: Water supply to cis-lunar orbit and platinum mining. First, we
conduct a state-of-the-art of current environmental life cycle assessment for
the space domain and platinum mining. Second, a first order environmental life
cycle assessment is conducted, including goal and scope definition, inventory
analysis, and impact assessment. We compare water supply to cis-lunar orbit
with and without asteroid mining and go on to compare terrestrial with
space-based platinum mining. The results indicate that asteroid water mining
would have environmental benefits, as soon as the amount of water supplied via
mining is larger than the mass of the spacecraft used for mining. For platinum
mining, we find that by comparing the operations phase of terrestrial and space
mining, space mining would have a lower environmental impact, if the spacecraft
is able to return between 0.3 to 7% of its mass in platinum to Earth, assuming
100% primary platinum or 100% secondary platinum, respectively. For future
work, we propose a more detailed analysis, based on a more precise inventory
and a larger system boundary, including the production of the launcher and
spacecraft.

imposes a stringent condition on the input-output leakage rates, we demonstrate
that this condition can be significantly relaxed in systems of coupled

across a range of driving frequencies in coupled cavities by tuning the output
leakage rate alone. Numerical calculations based on the driven-dissipative

defining a novel end-to-end trainable model called as Deep Recurrent Level Set
(DRLS). The proposed DRLS consists of three layers, i.e, Convolutional layers,
Deconvolutional layers with skip connections and LevelSet layers. Brain tumor
segmentation is taken as an instant to illustrate the performance of the
proposed DRLS. Convolutional layer learns visual representation of brain tumor
at different scales. Since brain tumors occupy a small portion of the image,
deconvolutional layers are designed with skip connections to obtain a high
quality feature map. Level-Set Layer drives the contour towards the brain
tumor. In each step, the Convolutional Layer is fed with the LevelSet map to
obtain a brain tumor feature map. This in turn serves as input for the LevelSet
layer in the next step. The experimental results have been obtained on
BRATS2013, BRATS2015 and BRATS2017 datasets. The proposed DRLS model improves
both computational time and segmentation accuracy when compared to the the
classic VLS-based method. Additionally, a fully end-to-end system DRLS achieves

introduce a systematic analytic approach by focusing on solutions with spectra

that in the gravitational case the returns are not exact. Furthermore, our
analysis predicts and explains specific integer numbers of direct-reverse
cascade sequences that result in particularly accurate energy returns

appropriate longer multiple periods in this manner). In addition, we explain,
at least in this regime, the ubiquitous appearance of direct-reverse cascades

human-generated sensory data varies significantly among different users. To
better utilize sensory data, the problem of truth discovery, whose goal is to
estimate user quality and infer reliable aggregated results through
quality-aware data aggregation, has emerged as a hot topic. Although the
existing truth discovery approaches can provide reliable aggregated results,
they fail to protect the private information of individual users. Moreover,
crowd sensing systems typically involve a large number of participants, making
encryption or secure multi-party computation based solutions difficult to
deploy. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an efficient
privacy-preserving truth discovery mechanism with theoretical guarantees of
both utility and privacy. The key idea of the proposed mechanism is to perturb
data from each user independently and then conduct weighted aggregation among
users' perturbed data. The proposed approach is able to assign user weights
based on information quality, and thus the aggregated results will not deviate
much from the true results even when large noise is added. We adapt local
differential privacy definition to this privacy-preserving task and demonstrate
the proposed mechanism can satisfy local differential privacy while preserving
high aggregation accuracy. We formally quantify utility and privacy trade-off
and further verify the claim by experiments on both synthetic data and a

short note, we give an affirmative answer to this question. We show that the FW
method (with a line search for the step size) for optimization over a strongly

$O(\max(1/\epsilon^{1-\theta}, \log(1/\epsilon)))$ where $\theta\in[0,1]$ is a
constant that characterizes the error bound condition. Our results imply that
if the constrained set is characterized by a strongly convex function and the

then the FW method enjoys a fast rate of $O(1/t^2)$.

is uniquely suited for this task through its Beam Energy Scan (BES) program
which allowed for a large range in baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ as was
successfully demonstrated after the completion of Phase 1 in 2014. Phase 2 of
the BES at RHIC is scheduled to start in 2019 and will explore with precision
measurements the intermediate-to-high $\mu_B$ region of the QCD phase diagram,
five energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ from 7.7 to 19.6 GeV in collider mode and eight
energies $\sqrt{s{_{NN}}}$ from 3.0 to 7.7 GeV in fixed-target mode. Some of
the key measurements are: the net-protons kurtosis that could pinpoint the
position of a critical point, the directed flow that might prove a softening of
the EOS, and the chiral restoration in the dielectron channel. These
measurements will be possible with an order of magnitude better statistics
provided by the electron cooling upgrade of RHIC and with the detector upgrades
planned to improve STAR's acceptance. These proceedings review the BES Phase-2

transportation analysis and several attempts to perform road safety assessments
have recently been carried out. However, these approaches often ignore causal
relationships between different levels of vehicle interactions and/or accident
types and they lack a physical representation of the accident phenomena itself.
In this paper, a new generic probabilistic safety assessment framework for
traffic microscopic simulation tools is proposed. The probability of a specific
accident occurring is estimated by an accident propensity function that
consists of a deterministic safety score component and a random component. The
formulation of the safety score depends on the type of occurrence, on detailed
vehicle interactions and maneuvers and on its representation in a simulation
environment. This generic model is applied to the case of an urban motorway and
specified to four types of outcomes: non-accident events and three types of
accidents in a nested structure: rear-end, lane-changing, and run-off-road
accidents. The model was estimated and validated using simulated microscopic
data. To obtained the consistent simulated data, a two-step simulation
calibration procedure was adopted: (1) using real trajectories collected on
site for detailed behavior representation; and (2) using aggregate data from
each event used in safety model estimation. The final estimated safety model is
able to identify and interpret several simulated vehicle interactions. The fact
that these outcomes were extracted from simulated analysis shows the real
potential of calibrated traffic microscopic simulation for detailed safety
assessments.

individuals, professionals, and companies, that upload massive amounts of
content, such as text, pictures, and video, every day. Content creators retain
the intellectual property (IP) rights on the content they share with these
networks, however, very frequently they implicitly grant them, a sometimes,
overly broad license to use that content, which enables the services to use it
in possibly undesirable ways. For instance, Facebook claims a transferable,
sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license on all user-provided content.
Professional content creators, like photographers, are particularly affected.
In this paper we propose a design for decoupling user data from social
networking services without any loss of functionality for the users. Our design
suggests that user data are kept off the social networking service, in third
parties that enable the hosting of user-generated content under terms of
service and overall environment (e.g., a different location) that better suit
the user's needs and wishes. At the same time, indirection schemata are
seamlessly integrated in the social networking service, without any cooperation
from the server side necessary, so that users can transparently access the
off-site data just as they would if hosted in-site. We have implemented our
design as an extension for the Chrome Web browser, called Redirect2Own, and
show that it incurs negligible overhead on accessing 'redirected' content. We
offer the extension as free software and its code as an open-source project.

age-at-event and calendar time, together with the evident fact of memory fading

multinomial regression function. Establishing consistency and asymptotic
normality of the parametric MLE requires a bit of tweaking of the standard

a non-parametric MLE, propose a computationally simpler approximation, and
establish the consistency of both these estimators under mild conditions. We
study the small sample performance of the parametric and non-parametric

consumption have been widely studied as a potential candidate for millimeter
wave (mmWave) communications. Channel estimators that require knowledge of the
array response, such as those using compressive sensing (CS) methods, may
suffer from performance degradation when array-inherent impairments bring
unknown phase errors and gain errors to the antenna elements. In this paper, we
design matrix completion (MC)-based channel estimation schemes which are robust
against the array-inherent impairments. We first design an open-loop training
scheme that can sample entries from the effective channel matrix randomly and
is compatible with the phase shifter-based hybrid system. Leveraging the
low-rank property of the effective channel matrix, we then design a channel
estimator based on the generalized conditional gradient (GCG) framework and the
alternating minimization (AltMin) approach. The resulting estimator is immune
to array-inherent impairments and can be implemented to systems with any array
shapes for its independence of the array response. In addition, we extend our
design to sample a transformed channel matrix following the concept of
inductive matrix completion (IMC), which can be solved efficiently using our
proposed estimator and achieve similar performance with a lower requirement of
the dynamic range of the transmission power per antenna. Numerical results
demonstrate the advantages of our proposed MC-based channel estimators in terms
of estimation performance, computational complexity and robustness against
array-inherent impairments over the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-based CS
channel estimator.

  Factor Runge--Kutta Methods","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1708.02595",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Strong stability preserving (SSP) Runge-Kutta methods are desirable when
evolving in time problems that have discontinuities or sharp gradients and
require nonlinear non-inner-product stability properties to be satisfied.
Unlike the case for L2 linear stability, implicit methods do not significantly
alleviate the time-step restriction when the SSP property is needed. For this
reason, when handling problems with a linear component that is stiff and a
nonlinear component that is not, SSP integrating factor Runge--Kutta methods
may offer an attractive alternative to traditional time-stepping methods. The
strong stability properties of integrating factor Runge--Kutta methods where
the transformed problem is evolved with an explicit SSP Runge--Kutta method
with non-decreasing abscissas was recently established. In this work, we
consider the use of downwinded spatial operators to preserve the strong
stability properties of integrating factor Runge--Kutta methods where the
Runge--Kutta method has some decreasing abscissas. We present the SSP theory
for this approach and present numerical evidence to show that such an approach
is feasible and performs as expected. However, we also show that in some cases
the integrating factor approach with explicit SSP Runge--Kutta methods with
non-decreasing abscissas performs nearly as well, if not better, than with
explicit SSP Runge--Kutta methods with downwinding. In conclusion, while the
downwinding approach can be rigorously shown to guarantee the SSP property for
a larger time-step, in practice using the integrating factor approach by
including downwinding as needed with optimal explicit SSP Runge--Kutta methods
does not necessarily provide significant benefit over using explicit SSP
Runge--Kutta methods with non-decreasing abscissas.

multiple regression analysis as the downstream task. Records are linked via a
random partition model, which allows for a wide class to be considered. In
addition, we jointly model the record linkage and downstream task, which allows
one to account for the record linkage uncertainty exactly. Moreover, one is
able to generate a feedback propagation mechanism of the information from the

the dominant source of the far-infrared luminosity. On the other hand, the same
lines were undetected in the outflow region associated with the northern
nucleus, whose primary heating source is likely related to starburst activity
without obvious signs of AGN. Both HCO+(1-0)/CO(1-0) line ratio (i.e. dense gas
fraction) and the CO(3-2)/CO(1-0) line ratio are larger in the southern outflow
(0.20$\pm$0.04 and 1.3$\pm$0.2, respectively) than in the southern nucleus

quantum technologies. We design and realize a degenerate entangled-photon
source from an ultrafast pulsed laser pumped spontaneous parametric
down-conversion (SPDC), which show simultaneously ~97% heralding efficiency and
~96% indistinguishability between independent single photons. Such a
high-efficiency and frequency-uncorrelated SPDC source allows generation of the
first 12-photon genuine entanglement with a state fidelity of 0.572(24). We
further demonstrate a blueprint of scalable scattershot boson sampling using 12
SPDC sources and a 12*12-modes interferometer for three-, four-, and five-boson
sampling, which yields count rates more than four orders of magnitudes higher
than all previous SPDC experiments. Our work immediately enables
high-efficiency implementations of multiplexing, scattershot boson sampling,
and heralded creation of remotely entangled photons, opening up a promising
pathway to scalable photonic quantum technologies.

actions and taking proactive measures to optimize business outcome is a crucial
step towards sustaining the steady business growth. In this work, we focus on
pre- dicting attrition, which is one of typical user intended actions.
Conventional attrition predictive modeling strategies suffer a few inherent
drawbacks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel end-to-end
learning scheme to keep track of the evolution of attrition patterns for the
predictive modeling. It integrates user activity logs, dynamic and static user
profiles based on multi-path learning. It exploits historical user records by
establishing a decaying multi-snapshot technique. And finally it employs the
precedent user intentions via guiding them to the subsequent learning
procedure. As a result, it addresses all disadvantages of conventional methods.
We evaluate our methodology on two public data repositories and one private
user usage dataset provided by Adobe Creative Cloud. The extensive experiments
demonstrate that it can offer the appealing performance in comparison with
several existing approaches as rated by different popular metrics. Furthermore,
we introduce an advanced interpretation and visualization strategy to
effectively characterize the periodicity of user activity logs. It can help to
pinpoint important factors that are critical to user attrition and retention
and thus suggests actionable improvement targets for business practice. Our
work will provide useful insights into the prediction and elucidation of other
user intended actions as well.

3) approximately 70% of the organs are easy-to-transplant. Implementing our
transplantation strategy for different kinds of organs, we manually extract 30
organs in three different programming languages, namely Java, Python, and C,
and make unit tests for them utilizing four testing tools (two for Java, one
for Python, and one for C). At last, we transplant three Java organs into a

in the new system. All the 30 organs extracted by our strategy possess good
performances in unit test with the highest passing rate reaching 97% and the
lowest one still passing 80% and the three Java organs work well in the new

and optical properties of these two emerging 2D semiconductors, and evaluated
their performance for the application of localized surface plasmon resonance
(LSPR) at extreme conditions: in-plane direction versus out-of-plane direction
and monolayer versus multilayer. First, the energy band structure and
dielectric constants were calculated for both the monolayer and multilayer
structures using Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) with van der
Waals (vdW) corrections. A parallel-band effect observed in the monolayer band
structure indicates a strong light-matter interaction. Then, based on the
calculated dielectric constants, the performance of the LSPR excited by Au
sphere nanoparticles (NPs) was quantitatively characterized, including
polarizability, scattering and absorption cross-sections, and radiative
efficiency using Mie theory. For the multilayer HfSe2 and ZrSe2, the LSPR
showed very comparable intensities in both the in-plane and out-of-plane
directions, suggesting an isotropy-like light-matter interaction. In a
comparison, the LSPR excited on the monolayer HfSe2 and ZrSe2 was clearly
observed in the in-plane direction but effectively suppressed in the
out-of-plane direction due to the unique anisotropic nature. In addition to
this extraordinary anisotropy-to-isotropy transition as the layer number
increases, a red-shift of the LSPR wavelength was also found. Our work has
predicated the thickness-dependent anisotropic light-matter interaction on the

give rise to para-$S$-modules much in the same way as cyclic modules and mixed

with a natural framework to get analogues for paracyclic modules and parachain
complexes of various constructions and equivalence results for cyclic modules
or mixed complexes. The datum of a para-$S$-module does not provide us with a
chain complex, and so notions of homology and quasi-isomorphisms do not make
sense. We establish some generalizations for para-$S$-modules and parachain
complexes of the basic perturbation lemma of differential homological algebra.
These generalizations provide us with general recipes for converting
deformation retracts of Hoschschild chain complexes into deformation retracts
of para-$S$-modules. By using ideas of Kassel this then allows us to get
comparison results between the various para-$S$-modules associated with
para-precyclic modules, and between them and Connes' cyclic chain complex.
These comparison results lead us to alternative descriptions of Connes'
periodicity operator. This has some applications in periodic cyclic homology.
We also describe the counterparts of these results in cyclic cohomology. In
particular, we obtain an explicit way to convert a periodic $(b,B)$-cocycle
into a cohomologous periodic cyclic cocycle.

involves estimating different subjective aspects of the text, like structure,
clarity, etc. Such subjective aspects are better handled using cognitive
information. One such source of cognitive information is gaze behaviour. In
this paper, we show that gaze behaviour does indeed help in effectively
predicting the rating of text quality. To do this, we first model text quality
as a function of three properties - organization, coherence and cohesion. Then,
we demonstrate how capturing gaze behaviour helps in predicting each of these
properties, and hence the overall quality, by reporting improvements obtained
by adding gaze features to traditional textual features for score prediction.
We also hypothesize that if a reader has fully understood the text, the
corresponding gaze behaviour would give a better indication of the assigned
rating, as opposed to partial understanding. Our experiments validate this
hypothesis by showing greater agreement between the given rating and the
predicted rating when the reader has a full understanding of the text.

(PCC-OFDM) is a form of OFDM that has waveforms which are very well localized
in both the time and frequency domains and so it is ideally suited for use in
the 5G network. This paper analyzes the performance of PCC-OFDM in the uplink
of a multiuser system using orthogonal frequency division multiple access
(OFDMA) and compares it with conventional cyclic prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM), and
universal filtered multicarrier (UFMC). PCC-OFDM is shown to be much less
sensitive than either CP-OFDM or UFMC to time and frequency offsets. For a
given constellation size, PCC-OFDM in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
requires 3dB lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a given bit-error-rate, and
the SNR advantage of PCC-OFDM increases rapidly when there are timing and/or
frequency offsets. For PCC-OFDM no frequency guard band is required between
different OFDMA users. PCC-OFDM is completely compatible with CP-OFDM and adds
negligible complexity and latency, as it uses a simple mapping of data onto
pairs of subcarriers at the transmitter, and a simple weighting-and-adding of
pairs of subcarriers at the receiver. The weighting and adding step, which has
been omitted in some of the literature, is shown to contribute substantially to
the SNR advantage of PCC-OFDM. A disadvantage of PCC-OFDM (without overlapping)
is the potential reduction in spectral efficiency because subcarriers are
modulated in pairs, but this reduction is more than regained because no guard
band or cyclic prefix is required and because, for a given channel, larger
constellations can be used.

Interestingly, it is found that the thermal conductivity of GNPM is counter
intuitively enhanced by isotope engineering, which is strong contrast to the
common notion that isotope engineering reduces thermal conductivity.Further
mode analysis and atomic Green function calculation reveal that the unexpected
increasing in thermal conductivity originates from the breaking of the resonant
hybridization wave effect between the resonant modes and the propagating modes
induced by isotope engineering. Besides, factors including the system width and
pillar height can also efficiently tune the thermal conductivity of GNPM. This
abnormal mechanism provides a new dimension to manipulate phonon transport in
nanoribbon based nanostructures through wave effect.

the factor analysis (FA) model and its mixture version (known as mixtures of
factor analyzers (MFA)) using non-normal and asymmetric distributions. These
models adopt various types of skew densities for either the factors or the
errors. While the relationships between various choices of skew distributions
have been discussed in the literature, the differences between placing the
assumption of skewness on the factors or on the errors have not been closely

between these two types of formulations for skew factor models. In doing so, we
introduce a further formulation that unifies these two formulations; that is,
placing a skew distribution on both the factors and the errors.

vehicles and roadside systems. This allocation for DSRC in the ITS band has
been a co-primary allocation while the band is shared with the Fixed Satellite
Service (FSS), fixed microwave service, amateur radio services and other
Federal users authorized by the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration (NTIA). In recent time, Cellular V2X (C-V2X), introduced in 3GPP
Release 14 LTE standard, has received significant attention due to its
perceived ability to deliver superior performance with respect to vehicular
safety applications. There is a strong momentum in the industry for C-V2X to be
considered as a viable alternative to DSRC and accordingly, to operate in the
ITS spectrum. In another recent notice, the FCC is soliciting input for a
proposed rulemaking to open up more bandwidth for unlicensed Wi-Fi devices,
mainly based on the 802.11ac standard. The FCC plans to work with the
Department of Transportation (DoT), and the automotive and communications
industries to evaluate potential sharing techniques in the ITS band between
DSRC and Wi-Fi devices. This paper analyzes the expected scenarios that might
emerge from FCC and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
regulation options and identifies the technical challenge associated with each

technical challenges remain open research problems that need to be addressed.
We conclude that the most challenging issue is related to the interoperability

irreplaceable sensor, LiDAR can provide continuous and high-frequency pose
estimation by means of mapping, on condition that enough environment features
are available. The error of mapping can accumulate over time. Therefore, LiDAR
is usually integrated with other sensors. In diverse urban scenarios, the
environment feature availability relies heavily on the traffic (moving and
static objects) and the degree of urbanization. Common LiDAR-based SLAM
demonstrations tend to be studied in light traffic and less urbanized area.
However, its performance can be severely challenged in deep urbanized cities,
such as Hong Kong, Tokyo, and New York with dense traffic and tall buildings.
This paper proposes to analyze the performance of standalone NDT-based graph
SLAM and its reliability estimation in diverse urban scenarios to further
evaluate the relationship between the performance of LiDAR-based SLAM and
scenario conditions. The normal distribution transform (NDT) is employed to
calculate the transformation between frames of point clouds. Then, the LiDAR
odometry is performed based on the calculated continuous transformation. The
state-of-the-art graph-based optimization is used to integrate the LiDAR
odometry measurements to implement optimization. The 3D building models are
generated and the definition of the degree of urbanization based on Skyplot is
proposed. Experiments are implemented in different scenarios with different
degrees of urbanization and traffic conditions. The results show that the
performance of the LiDAR-based SLAM using NDT is strongly related to the
traffic condition and degree of urbanization.

lower-triangular structure of the uncertainty propagator, this model can be
approximated efficiently using the Wiener chaos expansion in the probability
space. Such a Wick-type model provides, in general, a second-order
approximation of the classical one in terms of the standard deviation of the
underlying Gaussian process. Furthermore, when the correlation length of the
underlying Gaussian process goes to infinity, the Wick-type model yields the
same solution as the classical one. These observations imply that the Wick-type
elliptic equation can provide an effective preconditioner for the classical
random elliptic equation under appropriate conditions. We use the Wick-type
elliptic model to accelerate the Monte Carlo method and the stochastic Galerkin
finite element method. Numerical results are presented and discussed.

convergence to achieve regularization on model parameters. The augmented noises
can be designed to achieve various regularization effects on graph estimation,
such as the bridge (including lasso and ridge), elastic net, adaptive lasso,
and SCAD penalization; it also realizes the group lasso and fused ridge. We
examine the tail bound of the noise-augmented loss function and establish that
the noise-augmented loss function and its minimizer converge almost surely to
the expected penalized loss function and its minimizer, respectively. We derive
the asymptotic distributions for the regularized parameters through PANDA in
generalized linear models, based on which, inferences for the parameters can be
obtained simultaneously with variable selection. We show the non-inferior
performance of PANDA in constructing graphs of different types in simulation
studies and apply PANDA to an autism spectrum disorder data to construct a
mixed-node graph. We also show that the inferences based on the asymptotic
distribution of regularized parameter estimates via PANDA achieve nominal or
near-nominal coverage and are far more efficient, compared to some existing
post-selection procedures. Computationally, PANDA can be easily programmed in
software that implements (GLMs) without resorting to complicated optimization

self-buckling of columns can be treated as a process of second order phase
transition by considering the straight column as disorder state, the bending
column as order state, and the temperature as the inverse of column length. The
critical temperature corresponds to the inverse of critical length for
buckling, 1/Lcr, and the deviation angle made by column free end relative to
vertical direction satisfies a scaling relationship with a scaling power of
0.485. Changing of the column geometry from the vertically upward to the
bending state can be considered as a transition from disorder state to order
state.

simply maximization of the expected margin, while more recent proposals
consider simultaneous variance control and proxy objectives based on robust

concentrated in a desirable region. While conceptually appealing, these new
approaches are often computationally unwieldy, and theoretical guarantees are

implemented using gradient descent, and admits finite-sample bounds on the
excess risk under unbounded inputs. Empirical tests on real-world benchmark

suggestive of a promising new technique for classification.

this integration by using models. We start by identifying some key technical

fashion security relevant information from safety assessments by translating
GSN-Models into ADTs; (2) We show how security results can impact the

challenging, but also appealing since a learning-based system should not

real environment the training process can be costly, time-consuming, and even
dangerous since failures are common at the start of training. For this reason,
it is desirable to be able to leverage \textit{simulation} and
\textit{off-policy} data to the extent possible to train the robot. In this
work, we introduce a robust framework that plans in simulation and transfers
well to the real environment. Our model incorporates a gradient-descent based
planning module, which, given the initial image and goal image, encodes the
images to a lower dimensional latent state and plans a trajectory to reach the
goal. The model, consisting of the encoder and planner modules, is trained
through a meta-learning strategy in simulation first. We subsequently perform
adversarial domain transfer on the encoder by using a bank of unlabelled but
random images from the simulation and real environments to enable the encoder
to map images from the real and simulated environments to a similarly
distributed latent representation. By fine tuning the entire model (encoder +
planner) with far fewer real world expert demonstrations, we show successful
planning performances in different navigation tasks.

intra-dense blocks, which extract and compress abundant local features via
densely connected convolutional layers and compression layers for further

the convenience of having cheap and renewable energy to power house appliances.
In contrast to other energy sources solar installations are distributed very
decentralized and spread over hundred-thousands of locations. On a global level
more than 25% of solar photovoltaic (PV) installations were decentralized. The
effect of the quick energy transition from a carbon based economy to a green
economy is though still very difficult to quantify. As a matter of fact the
quick adoption of solar panels by households is difficult to track, with local
registries that miss a large number of the newly built solar panels. This makes
the task of assessing the impact of renewable energies an impossible task.
Although models of the output of a region exist, they are often black box
estimations. This project's aim is twofold: First automate the process to
extract the location of solar panels from aerial or satellite images and
second, produce a map of solar panels along with statistics on the number of
solar panels. Further, this project takes place in a wider framework which
investigates how official statistics can benefit from new digital data sources.
At project completion, a method for detecting solar panels from aerial images
via machine learning will be developed and the methodology initially developed

solved with vector arithmetic. However, it is unclear why arithmetic operators
correspond to non-linear embedding models such as skip-gram with negative
sampling (SGNS). We provide a formal explanation of this phenomenon without
making the strong assumptions that past theories have made about the vector
space and word distribution. Our theory has several implications. Past work has
conjectured that linear substructures exist in vector spaces because relations
can be represented as ratios; we prove that this holds for SGNS. We provide
novel justification for the addition of SGNS word vectors by showing that it
automatically down-weights the more frequent word, as weighting schemes do ad
hoc. Lastly, we offer an information theoretic interpretation of Euclidean
distance in vector spaces, justifying its use in capturing word dissimilarity.

directly measured $M_\text{BH}$ values; 35 of these galaxies have been alleged
to contain pseudobulges, 21 have water maser measurements, and three appear

with a finessed image analysis. We have analyzed near-infrared images,
accounting for not only the bulge, disk (exponential, truncated, or inclined),

$\log\left(M_\text{BH}/M_{\odot}\right)=\left(2.44_{-0.31}^{+0.35}\right)\log\left\{M_{\rm*,sph}/[\upsilon(1.15\times10^{10}\,M_{\odot})]\right\}+(7.24\pm0.12)$,

properties of a galaxy's bulge and samples dominated by (high-mass) early-type
galaxies. Studying late-type galaxies should provide greater insight into the
mutual growth of black holes and galaxies in more gas-rich environments. We
have used 40 spiral galaxies to establish how $M_{BH}$ scales with both the
total stellar mass ($M_{*,tot}$) and the disk's stellar mass, having measured
the spheroid (bulge) stellar mass ($M_{*,sph}$) and presented the
$M_{BH}$-$M_{*,sph}$ relation in Paper I. The relation involving $M_{*,tot}$
may be beneficial for estimating $M_{BH}$ either from pipeline data or at
higher redshift, conditions that are not ideal for the accurate isolation of
the bulge. A symmetric Bayesian analysis finds
$\log\left(M_{BH}/M_{\odot}\right)=\left(3.05_{-0.49}^{+0.57}\right)\log\left\{M_{*,tot}/[\upsilon(6.37\times10^{10}\,M_{\odot})]\right\}+(7.25_{-0.14}^{+0.13})$.

0.56 dex for $M_{BH}$ on $M_{*,sph}$ and $0.57$ dex for $M_{BH}$ on $\sigma_*$.
The slope is $>2$ times that obtained using core-S\'ersic early-type galaxies,
echoing a similar result involving $M_{*,sph}$, and supporting a varied growth
mechanism among different morphological types. This steeper relation has
consequences for galaxy/black hole formation theories, simulations, and
predicting black hole masses. We caution that (i) an $M_{BH}$-$M_{*,tot}$

assumption or geometric invariances of individual residuals are encountered
through statistical averaging or the addition of robust kernels and smoothness

higher-order shape priors, the community more recently shifted its attention to
deep end-to-end models for solving geometric localization and mapping problems.
However, at test-time, these feed-forward models ignore the more traditional
geometric or photometric consistency terms, thus leading to a low ability to
recover fine details and potentially complete failure in corner case scenarios.
With an application to dense object modeling from RGBD images, our work aims at
taking the best of both worlds by embedding modern higher-order object shape
priors into classical iterative residual minimization objectives. We

capture (besides any arbitrary finite structure) a large variety of infinite

particle filters (CPFs). CPFs are used for the sequential estimation of the
difference of expectations w.r.t. filters which are in some sense close.
Examples include the estimation of the filtering distribution associated to
different parameters (finite difference estimation) and filters associated to
partially observed discretized diffusion processes (PODDP) and the
implementation of the multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) identity. We develop new
theory for CPFs and based upon several results, we propose a new CPF which
approximates the maximal coupling (MCPF) of a pair of predictor distributions.
In the context of ML estimation associated to PODDP with discretization
$\Delta_l$ we show that the MCPF and the approach in Jasra et al. (2018) have,
under assumptions, an asymptotic variance that is upper-bounded by an
expression that is (almost) $\mathcal{O}(\Delta_l)$, uniformly in time. The
$\mathcal{O}(\Delta_l)$ rate preserves the so-called forward rate of the
diffusion in some scenarios which is not the case for the CPF in Jasra et al
(2017).

induced under linearly polarized illumination. The vortex modes are obtained
only when the incident polarization direction differs from one of the ellipse
axes. Such a direct observation of the vortex modes is possible thanks to the
ability of the SNOM technique to obtain information on both the amplitude and
the phase of the near field. The presence of the vortex mode is determined by
the rotational symmetry breaking of the system and it can be considered the
counterpart of the photonic spin Hall effect. Finite element method
calculations show that such a vorticity originates from the presence of nodal
points where the phase of the field is undefined, leading to a circulation of
the energy flow. The configuration producing vortex modes corresponds to a
nonzero total topological charge (+1).

Considering the huge amount number of features in real-world applications, FS

especially when data arrive sequentially. In this paper, we propose an online
feature selection system which resolves this problem. More specifically, we
treat the problem of online supervised feature selection for binary

problem leads to a hybridization between two important domains: feature
selection using online learning technique (OFS) and automated negotiation (AN).
The proposed OFS system called MOANOFS (Multi-Objective Automated Negotiation

level, from n learners (or OFS methods), we decide which are the k trustful
ones (with high confidence or trust value). These elected k learners will
participate in the second level. In this level, we integrate our proposed
Multilateral Automated Negotiation based OFS (MANOFS) method to decide finally
which is the best solution or which are relevant features. We show that MOANOFS

generally ignore the traffic dynamics in the network. This restricts the proper
evaluation and dimensioning of the network from the perspective of a mobile
operator. To address the effect of dynamic traffic, recently, the mean cell
approach has been introduced, which approximates the average network load by
the zero cell load. However, this is not a realistic characterization of the
network load, since a zero cell is statistically larger than a random cell
drawn from the population of cells, i.e., a typical cell. In this paper, we
analyze the load of a noise-limited network characterized by high signal to
noise ratio (SNR). The noise-limited assumption can be applied to a variety of
scenarios, e.g., millimeter wave networks with efficient interference
management mechanisms. First, we provide an analytical framework to obtain the
cumulative density function of the load of the typical cell. Then, we obtain
two approximations of the average load of the typical cell. We show that our
study provides a more realistic characterization of the average load of the
network as compared to the mean cell approach. Moreover, the prescribed
closed-form approximation is more tractable than the mean cell approach.

Self-similarity is an emergent symmetry of gravitational collapse near the

has been intensively studied in the past for self-gravitating scalar fields or
perfect fluids, but little is known concerning other systems. Here we assess
the impact of gauge fields on critical collapse, in the context of low-energy
string theories. Matter fields need not inherit the symmetries of a spacetime.
We determine the homothetic conditions that scale-invariance of the metric
imposes on the dilaton and electromagnetic fields, and we obtain their general
solution. The inclusion of a potential for the dilaton is compatible with the
homothetic conditions if and only if it is of the Liouville type. By imposing
also spherical symmetry, a detailed analysis of critical collapse in these
systems is possible by casting the field equations as an autonomous system. We
find analytically that Choptuik's critical exponent depends on the dilaton
coupling. Despite this and the presence of two novel fixed points, the
electromagnetic field necessarily vanishes for the critical solution.

helps to dissect neutral and adaptive evolutionary mechanisms that shape
genetic and phenotypic variation in natural populations along environmental

laws of circulation of international news predicted half a century ago by
Galtung and Ruge and by {\""O}stgaard are still valid. The salience of countries
in media remains strongly determined by size effects (area, population), with
prominent coverage of rich countries (GDP/capita) with elite status (permanent
members of UNSC, the Holy See). The effect of geographical distance and a
common language remains a major factor of media coverage in newsrooms.
Contradicting the flat world hypothesis, global journalism remains an
exception, and provincialism is the rule. The disaggregation of the model by
media demonstrates that newspapers are not following exactly the same rules and
are more or less sensitive to distance, a common language or elite status. The
disaggregation of the model by week suggests that the rules governing foreign
news can also be temporarily modified by exceptional events that eliminate the
usual effects of salience and relatedness, producing short periods of 'global
consensus' that can benefit small, poor and remote countries. This paper
concludes by recommending the use of a sample of carefully chosen diversified
media rather than a large aggregation of data for global studies.

systems as the number of particles tends to infinity. We consider two types of
particles, called positive and negative. Same-sign particles repel each other,
and opposite-sign particles attract each other. The interaction potential is
the same for all particles, up to the sign, and has a logarithmic singularity
at zero. The central example of such systems is that of dislocations in
crystals.
  Because of the singularity in the interaction potential, the discrete
evolution leads to blow-up in finite time. We remedy this situation by
regularising the interaction potential at a length-scale $\delta_n>0$, which
converges to zero as the number of particles $n$ tends to infinity.
  We establish two main results. The first one is an evolutionary convergence
result showing that the empirical measures of the positive and of the negative
particles converge to a solution of a set of coupled PDEs which describe the
evolution of their continuum densities. In the setting of dislocations these
PDEs are known as the Groma-Balogh equations. In the proof we rely on the
theory of $\lambda$-convex gradient flows, a priori estimates for the
Groma-Balogh equations and Orlicz spaces. The proof require $\delta_n$ to
converge to zero sufficiently slowly. The second result is a counterexample,
demonstrating that if $\delta_n$ converges to zero sufficiently fast, then the
limits of the empirical measures of the positive and the negative dislocations
do not satisfy the Groma-Balogh equations.
  These results show how the validity of the Groma-Balogh equations as the
limit of many-particle systems depends in a subtle way on the scale at which
the singularity of the potential is regularised.

For the first time, a rather detailed analysis of the CM effect for an
arbitrary direction of the cosmic magnetic field with respect to photon
direction of propagation is done. Considering the CMB linearly polarized at the
decoupling time, it is shown that the CM effect is one of the most substantial
effects in generating circular polarization especially in the low part of the
CMB spectrum. It is shown that in the frequency range $10^8$ Hz $\leq \nu_0\leq
10^9$ Hz, the degree of circular polarization of the CMB at present for
perpendicular propagation with respect to the cosmic magnetic field is in the
range $ 10^{-13}\lesssim P_C(t_0)\lesssim 7.65\times 10^{-7}$ or Stokes
circular polarization parameter $2.7 \times 10^{-13}$ K $\lesssim
|V(t_0)|\lesssim 2 \times 10^{-6}$ K for values of the cosmic magnetic field
amplitude at present in the range $10^{-9}$ G $\lesssim B\lesssim 8\times

range. Estimates on the rotation angle of the CMB polarization plane

balance between the superconductivity and the competing order has been
controlled mainly by changing thermodynamic parameters, such as the
physical/chemical pressure and carrier density. However, such a thermodynamic
approach may not be the only way to materialize the superconductivity. Here, we
present a new kinetic approach to avoiding the competing order and thereby

including the effects of weak-lensing convergence. To do so, we introduce the
lognormal function as the convergence PDF modeling the lensing scatter of SN Ia
magnitude, and apply a sample selection for SNe Ia to avoid strongly lensed
samples. Comparing with the contribution of other uncertainties (e.g., the
intrinsic magnitude scatter), we find that the lensing effect is dominant at $z
> 1$. Then forecasting the parameter constraints for the Wide-Field InfraRed
Survey Telescope survey, we show that considering the weak-lensing effect, the
constraints on the density parameters $\Omega_m$ or $\Omega_{\Lambda}$, and the
dark energy equation of state $w$ are improved, especially for SNe Ia samples
at higher redshift $z > 1$. Furthermore, we see that the degeneracy between the
total mass of neutrino $\Sigma m_{\nu}$ and the (cold) dark matter density
parameter $\Omega_{c}$ can be resolved.

study, the cross sections and astrophysical rates of (g,p) and (g,a) reactions
for about 3000 target nuclei with 10<Z<100 ranging from stable to proton
dripline nuclei are computed. To study the sensitivity of the calculations to
the optical model potentials (OMPs), both the phenomenological Woods-Saxon and
the microscopic folding OMPs are taken into account. The systematic comparisons
show that the reaction rates, especially for the (g,a) reaction, are
dramatically influenced by the OMPs. Thus the better determination of the OMP
is crucial to reduce the uncertainties of the photodisintegration reaction
rates involving charged particles. Meanwhile, a gamma-beam facility at ELI-NP
is being developed, which will open new opportunities to experimentally study
the photodisintegration reactions of astrophysics interest. Considering both
the important reactions identified by the nucleosynthesis studies and the
purpose of complementing the experimental results for the reactions involving
p-nuclei, the measurements of six (g,p) and eight (g,a) reactions based on the
gamma-beam facility at ELI-NP and the ELISSA detector for the charged particles

performed. The minimum required energies of the gamma-beam to measure these

photonuclear reactions within the Gamow windows at T_9=2.5 for p-process are
fairly feasible and promising at ELI-NP. The expected experimental results will

measurements of this dipole are barely above the expected noise and unable to
provide a robust test. Upcoming radio continuum surveys with the SKA should be
able to detect the dipole at high signal to noise. We simulate number count

of this summary is that it allows one to apply tools from statistics and

persistence landscapes is stable and invertible. We introduce a weighted
version of the persistence landscape and define a one-parameter family of
Poisson-weighted persistence landscape kernels that may be useful for learning.
We also demonstrate some additional properties of the persistence landscape.
First, the persistence landscape may be viewed as a tropical rational function.
Second, in many cases it is possible to exactly reconstruct all of the
component persistence diagrams from an average persistence landscape. It
follows that the persistence landscape kernel is characteristic for certain
generic empirical measures. Finally, the persistence landscape distance may be
arbitrarily small compared to the interleaving distance.

constants $t$, $t'=-0.3t$ and $t''=0.2t$, respectively. The nonzero values of

half-filling, while for larger $U$ they arise as the Fermi level leaves the
Mott gap. The peaks are connected with a narrow band emerging at low

the physics leading to the decrease of the total divertor ion current (It), or
'roll-over', is experimentally explored on the TCV tokamak through
characterization of the location, magnitude and role of the various divertor
ion sinks and sources including a complete analysis of particle and power
balance. These first measurements of the profiles of divertor ionisation and
hydrogenic radiation along the divertor leg are enabled through novel
spectroscopic techniques. Over a range in TCV plasma conditions (plasma current
and electron density, with/without impurity-seeding) the $I_t$ roll-over is
ascribed to a drop in the divertor ion source; recombination remains small or
negligible farther into the detachment process. The ion source reduction is
driven by both a reduction in the power available for ionization, Precl, and
concurrent increase in the energy required per ionisation, $E_{ion}$: often
described as 'power starvation' (or 'power limitation'). The detachment
threshold is found experimentally (in agreement with analytic model
predictions) to be $\sim P_{recl}/I_t {E_{ion}} \sim 2$, corresponding to a
target electron temperature, $T_t \sim E_{ion}/{\gamma}$ where ${\gamma}$ is
the sheath transmission coefficient. The target pressure reduction, required to
reduce the target ion current, is driven both by volumetric momentum loss as
well as upstream pressure loss. The measured evolution through detachment of
the divertor profile of various ion sources/sinks as well as power losses are
quantitatively reproduced through full 2D SOLPS modelling through the
detachment process as the core density is varied.

evolution. This yields direct insight into the time-ordering contributions to
the unitary time evolution. In order to prove extraction of the quantities of

renewable sources of electric power. The latter are connected to the grid via
inverters and as such have little, if any rotational inertia. The resulting
reduction of total inertia raises important issues of power grid stability,
especially over short-time scales. We have constructed a model of the
synchronous grid of continental Europe with which we numerically investigate
frequency deviations as well as rates of change of frequency (RoCoF) following
abrupt power losses. The magnitude of RoCoF's and frequency deviations strongly
depend on the fault location, and we find the largest effects for faults
located on the slowest mode - the Fiedler mode - of the network Laplacian
matrix. This mode essentially vanishes over Belgium, Eastern France, Western
Germany, northern Italy and Switzerland. Buses inside these regions are only
weakly affected by faults occuring outside. Conversely, faults inside these
regions have only a local effect and disturb only weakly outside buses.
Following this observation, we reduce rotational inertia through three
different procedures by either (i) reducing inertia on the Fiedler mode, (ii)
reducing inertia homogeneously and (iii) reducing inertia outside the Fiedler
mode. We find that procedure (iii) has little effect on disturbance
propagation, while procedure (i) leads to the strongest increase of RoCoF and
frequency deviations. These results for our model of the European transmission
grid are corroborated by numerical investigations on the ERCOT transmission
grid.

becomes a linear combination of the self and antiself conjugate spinors with

preserves the self/antiself conjugacy of these spinors! This apparently
paradoxical situation is fully resolved. This new effect, to the best of our

imaging (FLIM) are powerful imaging techniques in bio-molecular science. The
need for elaborate light sources for TPEF and speed limitations for FLIM,
however, hinder an even wider application. We present a way to overcome this
limitations by combining a robust and inexpensive fiber laser for nonlinear
excitation with a fast analog digitization method for rapid FLIM imaging. The
applied sub nanosecond pulsed laser source is synchronized to a high analog
bandwidth signal detection for single shot TPEF- and single shot FLIM imaging.
The actively modulated pulses at 1064nm from the fiber laser are adjustable
from 50ps to 5ns with kW of peak power. At a typically applied pulse lengths
and repetition rates, the duty cycle is comparable to typically used
femtosecond pulses and thus the peak power is also comparable at same cw-power.
Hence, both types of excitation should yield the same number of fluorescence
photons per time on average when used for TPEF imaging. However, in the 100ps
configuration, a thousand times more fluorescence photons are generated per
pulse. In this paper, we now show that the higher number of fluorescence
photons per pulse combined with a high analog bandwidth detection makes it
possible to not only use a single pulse per pixel for TPEF imaging but also to
resolve the exponential time decay for FLIM. To evaluate the performance of our
system, we acquired FLIM images of a Convallaria sample with pixel rates of 1

digitizer. With the presented results, we show that longer pulses in the
many-10ps to nanosecond regime can be readily applied for TPEF imaging and
enable new imaging modalities like single pulse FLIM.

architecture and error back propagation algorithm with unsupervised learning
for minimizing the error function and modification of the parameters (weights

modified dynamical model of cosmology based on imposing Neumann boundary
condition on cosmological perturbation equations. Then, it is shown that a new
term appears in the equation of motion, which leads to a modified Poisson
equation. In addition, a modified Hubble parameter is derived due to the
presence of the new term. Moreover, it is proved that, without a cosmological
constant, such a model has a late time-accelerated expansion with an equation
of state converging to $w < -1$. Also, the luminosity distance in the present
model is shown to differ from that of the $\Lambda CDM$ model at high
redshifts. Furthermore, it is found that the adiabatic sound speed squared is
positive in radiation-dominated era and then converges to zero at later times.
Theoretical implications of the Neumann boundary condition have been discussed,
and it is shown that, by fixing the value of the conjugate momentum (under
certain conditions), one could derive a similar version of modified dynamics.
In a future work, we will confine the free parameters of the Neumann model

attackers and advanced persistent threats, which are known to exploit USB thumb
drives as an effective spreading vector. In ICSes, thumb drives are widely used
to transfer files among disconnected systems and represent a serious security
risks, since, they may be promiscuously used in both critical and regular
systems. The threats come both from malware hidden in files stored in the thumb
drives and from BadUSB attacks [16]. BadUSB leverages the modification of
firmware of USB devices in order to mimic the behaviour of a keyboard and send

spread by regular file infection or by firmware infection. The main component

be in the middle between a critical machine and all USB devices. We do not
require users to change the way they use thumb drives. To avoid human-errors,
we do not require users to take any decision. The proposed approach is highly

nearest-neighbor interaction only is well known to exhibit a macroscopic
(exponential in the system size $L$) ground-state degeneracy. With increasing
temperature, this degeneracy is expected to be lifted and the model undergoes a
first-order phase transition. For a model with an exponential degeneracy in the
whole low-temperature phase, it was recently found that the finite-size scaling
behavior is governed by leading correction terms $\sim L^{-2}$ instead of $\sim
L^{-3}$ as usual. To test the conjecture that such a transmuted behavior may
effectively persist also for the fcc antiferromagnet up to some crossover
system size, we have performed parallel multicanonical Monte Carlo simulations
for lattices of linear size $L \le 18$ with periodic boundary conditions and
determined various inverse pseudo phase transition temperatures, as well as the
extremal values of the specific heat and the energetic Binder parameter. We
indeed find that, for the simulated lattice sizes, the conjectured transmuted
finite-size scaling ansatz fits the data better than the standard ansatz. On
this basis, we extrapolate for the transition temperature an estimate of $T_0 =
1.735047(46)$.

demonstration, often in one attempt. Humans use this ability to quickly solve a
task instance, and to bootstrap learning of new tasks. Achieving these
abilities in autonomous agents is an open problem. In this paper, we introduce
an off-policy RL algorithm (MetaMimic) to narrow this gap. MetaMimic can learn
both (i) policies for high-fidelity one-shot imitation of diverse novel skills,
and (ii) policies that enable the agent to solve tasks more efficiently than
the demonstrators. MetaMimic relies on the principle of storing all experiences
in a memory and replaying these to learn massive deep neural network policies
by off-policy RL. This paper introduces, to the best of our knowledge, the
largest existing neural networks for deep RL and shows that larger networks
with normalization are needed to achieve one-shot high-fidelity imitation on a
challenging manipulation task. The results also show that both types of policy
can be learned from vision, in spite of the task rewards being sparse, and
without access to demonstrator actions.

a progressively shrinking (decaying) radius, and attracted towards the current
best solution with an increasing force. In the second phase, the particles are
mutated and recombined according to a multi-strategy approach in the fashion of
the ensemble of mutation strategies in Differential Evolution. The proposed
algorithm is tested, at different dimensionalities, on two complete black-box
optimization benchmarks proposed at the Congress on Evolutionary Computation
2010 and 2013. To demonstrate the applicability of the approach, we also test
MS-CAP to train a Feedforward Neural Network modelling the kinematics of an

luminosity range $42.2 \leq \log L_\mathrm{Ly\alpha} [\mathrm{erg\,s}^{-1}]\leq
43.5$ within a volume of $2.3\times10^5$ Mpc$^3$. For the LF construction we
utilise three different non-parametric estimators: The classical
$1/V_\mathrm{max}$ method, the $C^{-}$ method, and an improved binned estimator
for the differential LF. All three methods deliver consistent results, with the
cumulative LAE LF being $\Phi(\log L_\mathrm{Ly\alpha} [\mathrm{erg\,s}^{-1}] =
43.5) \simeq 3\times 10^{-6}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ and $\Phi(\log L_\mathrm{Ly\alpha}

bright- and faint-end of our survey, respectively. By employing a
non-parametric statistical test, as well as by comparing the full sample to
sub-samples in redshift bins, we find no supporting evidence for an evolving
LAE LF over the probed redshift and luminosity range. We determine the
best-fitting Schechter function parameters $\alpha = -1.84^{+0.42}_{-0.41}$ and
$\log L^* [\mathrm{erg\,s}^{-1}] = 42.2^{+0.22}_{-0.16}$ with the corresponding
normalisation $\log \phi^* [\mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}] = -2.71$. When correcting for
completeness in the LAE LF determinations, we take into account that LAEs
exhibit diffuse extended low surface-brightness haloes. We compare the
resulting LF to one obtained where we apply a correction assuming compact
point-like emission. We find that the standard correction underestimates the

nonlocality has yielded over the years many conceptual conundrums. Among the
latter are nonlocal aspects of single particles which have been of major
interest. In this paper, the nonlocality of single quanta is studied in a
square nested Mach-Zehnder interferometer with spatially separated detectors
using a delayed choice modification of quantum measurement outcomes that depend
on the complex-valued weak values. We show that if spacelike separated Bob and
Alice are allowed to freely control their quantum devices, the geometry of the
setup constrains the local hidden variables models. In particular, hidden
signaling and a list of contextual instructions are required to split a quantum
state characterized by a positive Wigner function into two quantum states with
non-positive Wigner functions. This implies that local hidden variables models
could rely neither on only two hidden variables for position and momentum, nor
on simultaneous factorizability of both the hidden probability densities and
weights of splitting to reproduce the correct quantum distributions. While our
analysis does not fully exclude the existence of nonfactorizable local hidden
variables models, it demonstrates that the recently proposed weak values of
quantum histories necessitate contextual splitting of prior commitments to
measurement outcomes, due to functional dependence on the total Feynman sum
that yields the complex-valued quantum probability amplitude for the studied
quantum transition. This analysis also highlights the quantum nature of weak
measurements.

transversity distribution of the proton at the physical pion mass. Within the
framework of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET), we compute the
transversity quasi-distributions using clover valence fermions on 2+1+1-flavor
(up/down, strange, charm) HISQ-lattice configurations with boosted proton
momenta as large as 3.0~GeV. The relevant lattice matrix elements are
nonperturbatively renormalized in regularization-independent
momentum-subtraction (RI/MOM) scheme and systematically matched to the physical
transversity distribution. With high statistics, large proton momenta and
meticulous control of excited-state contamination, we provide the best
theoretical prediction for the large-$x$ isovector quark transversity
distribution, with better precision than the most recent global analyses of
experimental data. Our result also shows that the sea quark asymmetry in the
proton transversity distribution is consistent with zero, which has been
assumed in all current global analyses.

with noise. By the sampling strategy, the fitness of a solution is evaluated
multiple times (called \emph{sample size}) independently, and its true fitness
is then approximated by the average of these evaluations. Most previous studies
on sampling are empirical, and the few theoretical studies mainly showed the
effectiveness of sampling with a sufficiently large sample size. In this paper,
we theoretically examine what strategies can work when sampling with any fixed
sample size fails. By constructing a family of artificial noisy examples, we
prove that sampling is always ineffective, while using parent or offspring
populations can be helpful on some examples. We also construct an artificial
noisy example to show that when using neither sampling nor populations is
effective, a tailored adaptive sampling (i.e., sampling with an adaptive sample
size) strategy can work. These findings may enhance our understanding of
sampling to some extent, but future work is required to validate them in
natural situations.

galaxies currently being discovered in the deepest ALMA and NOEMA cosmological

hypervisors are designed for general-purpose information processing systems,
they rely on large system stacks, so that they are not suitable for mixed

  We present the design and implementation of T-Visor, a hypervisor specialized

guarantees that the centralizer of a $C^1$-generic vector field is indeed
small, namely \textit{collinear}. The other criterion states that a $C^1$

actually be promoted to a stronger one, refered as \textit{quasi-triviality}.
In particular, the $C^1$-centralizer of a $C^1$-generic vector field is
quasi-trivial. In certain cases, we obtain the triviality of the centralizer of
a $C^1$-generic vector field, which includes $C^1$-generic Axiom A (or

many chain recurrent classes. For sufficiently regular vector fields, we also
obtain various criteria which ensure that the centralizer is \textit{trivial}

mixed states: two states are in the same phase if there exists a time
independent, fast and local Lindbladian evolution driving one state into the
other. The underlying idea, motivated by K\""onig and Pastawski in 2013, is that
it takes time to create new topological correlations, even with the use of
dissipation. We show that it is a good definition in the following sense: (1)
It divides the set of states into equivalent classes and it establishes a
partial order between those according to their level of ""topological
complexity"". (2) It provides a path between any two states belonging to the
same phase where observables behave smoothly. We then focus on pure states to
relate the new definition in this particular case with the usual definition for
quantum phases of closed systems in terms of the existence of a gapped path of
Hamiltonians connecting both states in the corresponding ground state path. We
show first that if two pure states are in the same phase in the Hamiltonian
sense, they are also in the same phase in the Lindbladian sense considered
here. We then turn to analyse the reverse implication, where we point out a
very different behaviour in the case of symmetry protected topological (SPT)
phases in 1D. Whereas at the Hamiltonian level, phases are known to be
classified with the second cohomology group of the symmetry group, we show that
symmetry cannot give any protection in 1D in the Lindbladian sense: there is
only one SPT phase in 1D independently of the symmetry group. We finish
analysing the case of 2D topological quantum systems. There we expect that
different topological phases in the Hamiltonian sense remain different in the
Lindbladian sense. We show this formally only for the $\mathbb{Z}_n$ quantum
double models.

  Little is known about how well experts perform at upper ontology integration.
To develop methodological and tool support, we first need to understand how
well experts do this task. We designed a study to measure the performance of
human experts at manually classifying classes in a general knowledge domain
ontology with entities in the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), an upper ontology

  We conclude that manually classifying domain entities under upper ontology

Expansion data of specimens composed of 54 different mixtures were measured
periodically throughout the entire test program. In this analysis, the mixtures
were first classified into three groups using K-means clustering based on their
expansion patterns. Within each group, the expansion rate was predicted as an
exclusive regression function of the water-cement ratio (W/C), tricalcium
aluminate (C_3 A) content of cement, cement content of cement or time of
expansion. Then, a support vector machine (SVM) was employed to determine the
classification criteria by relying on the characteristics of the mixture
proportions rather than the experimental performance, thereby enabling the
model to offer predictions for new mixtures without test data. An analysis of
the model indicated that concrete specimens with different mixture proportions,
especially with different W/C values or C_3 A contents, are unlikely to share
identical expansion patterns and should be considered and predicted
separately.separately.

Gaussian model, the CDG(Constrained Double Gaussians) model provides much

demonstrate the improvement of RV precision with CDG model. We find that the
improvement of CDG model is about 40\%$\sim$60\% for wavelength calibration

entanglement entropy production was discovered in non-integrable quenches in
the paramagnetic Ising quantum spin chain. Here we study the dynamics of
analogous quenches in the quantum Potts spin chain. Tuning the parameters of
the system, we observe a sudden increase in the entanglement production rate,
which is shown to be related to the appearance of new quasiparticle excitations
in the post-quench spectrum. Our results demonstrate the generality of the
effect and support its interpretation as the non-equilibrium version of the
well-known Gibbs paradox related to mixing entropy which appears in systems
with a non-trivial quasi-particle spectrum.

Tensor factorization (TF) based approaches have been applied to identify
characteristic metabolic patterns for differential diagnosis. However, these
conventional dimension-reduction strategies assume linear or multi-linear
relationships inside data, and are therefore insufficient to distinguish
nonlinear metabolic differences between various parkinsonian syndromes. In this
paper, we propose a Deep Projection Neural Network (DPNN) to identify
characteristic metabolic pattern for early differential diagnosis of
parkinsonian syndromes. We draw our inspiration from the existing TF methods.
The network consists of a (i) compression part: which uses a deep network to
learn optimal 2D projections of 3D scans, and a (ii) classification part: which
maps the 2D projections to labels. The compression part can be pre-trained
using surplus unlabelled datasets. Also, as the classification part operates on
these 2D projections, it can be trained end-to-end effectively with limited
labelled data, in contrast to 3D approaches. We show that DPNN is more
effective in comparison to existing state-of-the-art and plausible baselines.

incompressible hydrodynamic equations that govern the flow field, respectively.
With a truncated equilibrium distribution function as well as a temporal
derivative added to the source term, the macroscopic governing equations can be
exactly recovered from the kinetic models through the Chapmann-Enskog analysis.
Calculation of source terms involving high-order derivatives existed in the
quasi-incompressible model is simplified. A series of benchmark cases including
four interface-capturing tests and four binary flow tests are carried out.
Results compared to that of lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) have been obtained.
A convergence rate of second-order can be guaranteed in the test of interface
diagonal translation. The capability of present method in interface tracking

shallower (the size of the hot spot is much larger) than that, predicted by
simulations with simplified chemical models. These findings suggest that the
scenario leading to the deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) may depend
greatly on the chemical model used in simulations and that the Zeldovich
gradient mechanism is not necessary a universal mechanism triggering DDT. The
obtained results indicate that the conclusions derived from the simulations of
DDT with simplified chemical models should be viewed with great caution.

few years, new techniques based on graph embedding have emerged as a powerful
alternative to heuristics. In this article, we study the problem of systematic
biases in the prediction, and show that some methods based on graph embedding
offer less biased results than those based on heuristics, despite reaching
lower scores according to usual quality scores. We discuss the relevance of
this finding in the context of the filter bubble problem and the algorithmic
fairness of recommender systems.
