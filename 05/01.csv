$\Phi(A)$ defined on any subset $A \in (X,\c{A})$ on the sum of values in that

equations that has the structure of a viscous or nonviscous Cahn--Hilliard
system in which nonlinearities of double-well type occur. Standard cases like
regular or logarithmic potentials, as well as non-differentiable potentials
involving indicator functions, are admitted. The operators appearing in the
system equations are fractional versions of general linear operators $A$ and
$B$, where the latter are densely defined, unbounded, self-adjoint and monotone
in a Hilbert space of functions defined in a smooth domain and have compact
resolvents. We remark that our definition of the fractional power of operators
uses the approach via spectral theory. Typical cases are given by standard
second-order elliptic operators (e.g., the Laplacian) with zero Dirichlet or
Neumann boundary conditions, but also other cases like fourth-order systems or
systems involving the Stokes operator are covered by the theory. We derive
general well-posedness and regularity results that extend corresponding results
which are known for either the non-fractional Laplacian with zero Neumann
boundary condition or the fractional Laplacian with zero Dirichlet condition.
It turns out that the first eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ of $A$ plays an important
und not entirely obvious role: if $\lambda_1$ is positive, then the operators
$\,A\,$ and $\,B\,$ may be completely unrelated; if, however, $\lambda_1=0$,
then it must be simple and the corresponding one-dimensional eigenspace has to
consist of the constant functions and to be a subset of the domain of
definition of a certain fractional power of $B$. We are able to show general
existence, uniqueness, and regularity results for both these cases, as well as
for both the viscous and the nonviscous system.

involved in the neural circuit model. Furthermore, predicted response to varied
stimulation strength is calculated stochastically. Based on this theory, many
empirical models, such as strength-duration relationship and LNP model, can be
theoretically explained, derived, and amended. This theory can explain the
complex nonlinear interactions in electrical stimulation and fit in vivo
experiment data on stimulation-responses of many experiments. As such, the C-P

machine learning systems for computer vision, reinforcement learning, and other

apprised, especially after high classification accuracy has been attained. In
this paper, we evaluate the robustness of three recurrent neural networks to
tiny perturbations, on three widely used datasets, to argue that high accuracy
does not always mean a stable and a robust (to bounded perturbations,
adversarial attacks, etc.) system. Especially, normalizing the spectrum of the
discrete recurrent network to bound the spectrum (using power method, Rayleigh
quotient, etc.) on a unit disk produces stable, albeit highly non-robust neural
networks. Furthermore, using the $\epsilon$-pseudo-spectrum, we show that
training of recurrent networks, say using gradient-based methods, often result
in non-normal matrices that may or may not be diagonalizable. Therefore, the
open problem lies in constructing methods that optimize not only for accuracy
but also for the stability and the robustness of the underlying neural network,
a criterion that is distinct from the other.

found that yaw angles as small as 5{\deg} cause significant changes in both

  overlap with arXiv:1705.03070",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite the significant advances in vehicle automation and electrification,
the next-decade aspirations for massive deployments of autonomous electric
mobility on demand (AEMoD) services are still threatened by two major
bottlenecks, namely the computational and charging delays. This paper proposes
a solution for these two challenges by suggesting the use of fog computing for
AEMoD systems, and developing an optimized charging scheme for its vehicles
with and multi-class dispatching scheme for the customers. A queuing model
representing the proposed multi-class management scheme with sub-class service
is first introduced. The stability conditions of the system in a given city
zone are then derived. Decisions on the proportions of each class vehicles to
partially/fully charge, or directly serve customers of possible sub-classes are
then optimized in order to minimize the maximum response time of the system.
Results show the merits of our optimized model compared to a previously
proposed scheme and other non-optimized policies.

spatio-temporal full discretization are analyzed for the stochastic Allen-Cahn
equation driven by additive noise in space dimension $d \leq 3$. The full
discretization is realized by combining the standard finite element method with
the backward Euler time-stepping scheme. Distinct from the globally Lipschitz
setting, the error analysis becomes rather challenging and demanding, due to
the presence of the cubic nonlinearity in the underlying model. By introducing
two auxiliary approximation processes, we propose an appropriate decomposition
of the considered error terms and introduce a novel approach of error analysis,
to successfully recover the convergence rates of the numerical schemes. The
approach is original and does not rely on high-order spatial regularity
properties of the approximation processes. It is shown that the fully discrete
scheme possesses convergence rates of order $ O(h^{\gamma} ) $ in space and
order $ O( \tau^{ \frac{\gamma}{2} } )$ in time, subject to the spatial
correlation of the noise process, characterized by $
\|A^{\frac{\gamma-1}2}Q^{\frac12}\|_{\mathcal{L}_2}<\infty, \, \gamma \in[\frac
d3,2] $, $ d\in\{1,2,3\}$. In particular, a classical convergence rate of order
$O(h^2 +\tau)$ is reachable, even in multiple space dimensions, when the
aforementioned condition is fulfilled with $ \gamma = 2 $. Numerical examples
confirm the previous findings.

field of their models by using either a downsampling path composed of

is not clear which operation leads to best results. In this paper, we
systematically study the differences introduced by distinct receptive field
enlargement methods and their impact on the performance of a novel
architecture, called Fully Convolutional DenseResNet (FC-DRN). FC-DRN has a
densely connected backbone composed of residual networks. Following standard
image segmentation architectures, receptive field enlargement operations that
change the representation level are interleaved among residual networks. This
allows the model to exploit the benefits of both residual and dense
connectivity patterns, namely: gradient flow, iterative refinement of
representations, multi-scale feature combination and deep supervision. In order
to highlight the potential of our model, we test it on the challenging CamVid
urban scene understanding benchmark and make the following observations: 1)
downsampling operations outperform dilations when the model is trained from
scratch, 2) dilations are useful during the finetuning step of the model, 3)
coarser representations require less refinement steps, and 4) ResNets (by model
construction) are good regularizers, since they can reduce the model capacity
when needed. Finally, we compare our architecture to alternative methods and
report state-of-the-art result on the Camvid dataset, with at least twice fewer

aspects of enabling FD operation in various legacy wireless technologies.
Recently, the adoption of a simultaneous transmit and receive (STR) mode for
next generation wireless local area networks (WLANs) has received significant
attention. Enabling STR mode (FD communication mode) in 802.11 WLANs creates
bi-directional FD (BFD) and uni-directional FD (UFD) links. STR mode in 802.11
WLANs must be enabled with minimal protocol modifications while accounting for
the co-existence and compatibility with legacy nodes and protocols. This paper
provides a novel solution, that can leverage carrier sense multiple access with
enhanced collision avoidance (CSMA/ECA) and adaptive sensitivity control
mechanisms, for enabling STR operation. The key aspects of the proposed
solution include co-existence with legacy nodes, identification of eligible
nodes for UFD, optimization of secondary BFD and UFD transmissions, and
creation of UFD opportunities. Performance evaluation demonstrates that the
proposed solution is effective in achieving the gains provided by STR
operation.

kinematics of halo globular clusters (GCs) determined by Gaia. The second Gaia
data release (DR2) contained a catalogue of absolute proper motions (PMs) for a
set of Galactic GCs and satellite galaxies measured using Gaia DR2 data. We
select from the catalogue only halo GCs, identifying a total of 34 GCs spanning
$2.0 < r < 21.1$ kpc, and use their 3D kinematics to estimate the anisotropy
over this range to be $\beta = 0.46^{+0.15}_{-0.19}$, in good agreement, though
slightly lower than, a recent estimate for a sample of halo GCs using HST PM
measurements further out in the halo. We then use the Gaia kinematics to
estimate the mass of the MW inside the outermost GC to be $M(< 21.1
\mathrm{kpc}) = 0.21^{+0.04}_{-0.03} 10^{12} \mathrm{M_\odot}$, which
corresponds to a circular velocity of $v_\mathrm{circ}(21.1 \mathrm{kpc}) =
206^{+19}_{-16}$ km/s. The implied virial mass is $M_\mathrm{virial} =
1.28^{+0.97}_{-0.48} 10^{12} \mathrm{M_\odot}$. The error bars encompass the
uncertainties on the anisotropy and on the density profile of the MW dark halo,
and the scatter inherent in the mass estimator we use. We get improved
estimates when we combine the Gaia and HST samples to provide kinematics for 46
GCs out to 39.5 kpc: $\beta = 0.52^{+0.11}_{-0.14}$, $M(< 39.5 \mathrm{kpc}) =
0.42^{+0.07}_{-0.06} 10^{12} \mathrm{M_\odot}$, and $M_\mathrm{virial} =
1.54^{+0.75}_{-0.44} 10^{12} \mathrm{M_\odot}$. We show that these results are
robust to potential substructure in the halo GC distribution. While a wide
range of MW virial masses have been advocated in the literature, from below
$10^{12} \mathrm{M_\odot}$ to above $2 \times 10^{12}\mathrm{M_\odot}$, these
new data imply that an intermediate mass is most likely.

properties with the second data release (DR2) of {\em Gaia}, focusing on
dynamically confirmed and strong candidate black hole transients. DR2 provides
five-parameter astrometric solutions including position, parallax and proper
motion for 11 of a sample of 24 systems. Distance estimates are tested with
parallax inversion as well as Bayesian inference. We derive an empirically
motivated characteristic scale length of $L$=2.17$\pm$0.12 kpc for this BHXRB
population to infer distances based upon an exponentially decreasing space
density prior. Geometric DR2 parallaxes provide new, independent distance
estimates, but the faintness of this population in quiescence results in
relatively large fractional distance uncertainties. Despite this, DR2 estimates
generally agree with literature distances. The most discrepant case is BW Cir,
for which detailed studies of the donor star have suggested a distant location
at >~25 kpc. A large DR2 measured parallax and relatively high proper motion
instead prefer significantly smaller distances, suggesting that the source may
instead be amongst the nearest of XRBs. However, both distances create problems
for interpretation of the source, and follow-up data are required to resolve
its true nature. DR2 also provides a first distance estimate to one source,
MAXI J1820+070, and novel proper motion estimates for 7 sources. Peculiar
velocities relative to Galactic rotation exceed $\sim$ 50 km s$^{-1}$ for the
bulk of the sample, with a median system kinetic energy of peculiar motion of
$\sim$ 5 $\times$ 10$^{47}$ erg. BW Cir could be a new high-velocity BHXRB if
its astrometry is confirmed. A putative anti-correlation between peculiar
velocity and black hole mass is found, as expected in mass-dependent BH kick
formation channels, but this trend remains weak in the DR2 data.

hysteresis, seen in the recent mean-field dynamo model and the direct numerical
simulations of turbulent dynamos. The BL model with 'magnetic noise' as an
additional weak-source of the poloidal field recovers the solar cycle every
time from grand minima, which BL source alone cannot do. The noise-incorporated
model exhibits a bimodal distribution of toroidal field energy confirming two
modes of solar activity. It also shows intermittency and reproduces phase space
collapse, an experimental signature of the Maunder Minimum. The occurrence
statistics of grand minima in our model agree reasonably well with the observed
statistics in the reconstructed sunspot number. Finally, we demonstrate that
the level of magnetic noise controls the duration of grand minima and even has
a handle over its waiting period, suggesting a triggering effect of grand
minima by the noise and thus shutting down the global dynamo. Therefore, we
conclude that the 'magnetic noise' due to small-scale turbulent dynamo action
(or other sources) plays a vital role even in Babcock-Leighton dynamo models.

fluctuations in three dimensions using ultrafast coherent phonon spectroscopy.
We focus our attention on long wavelength charge density fluctuations
(plasmons), and charged nematic fluctuations where the direction of the
propagation vector is fixed perpendicular to the plane of anisotropy. By
treating phonons and light classically and decoupling interactions to integrate
out the fermionic degrees of freedom, we arrive at an effective theory of order
parameter fluctuations about the spatially uniform saddle-point solution. We
find that, due to the $(k_x^2-k_y^2) (B_{1g})$ symmetry of the form factor
appearing in the vertex, nematic fluctuations couple to light only at fourth
order, unlike isotropic density fluctuations which couple at second order.
Hence, to lowest order, the interaction between electrons and the
electromagnetic field contributes a driving force for plasmon oscillations
while it provides a frequency shift for nematic fluctuations. From the
resulting coupled harmonic oscillator equations of motion, we argue that
ultrafast coherent phonon spectroscopy could be a useful tool to extract and
analyze various electronic properties of interest such as the frequency of the
collective mode and the coupling between electrons and phonons. Specific
experiments are proposed on the normal state of FeSe to observe the frequency
shift predicted here resulting directly from orbital ordering (nematic)
fluctuations. Our paper presents a new mechanism for generating coherent
phonons from long-range interactions (coherent long-range interaction induced
phonons) that does not require the existence of multiple bands to act as
intermediary states for quasiparticles.

1240 that hosts double radio relics. In combination with the GMRT $595-629$ MHz
and VLA $2-4$ GHz data, we characterised the spectral and polarimetric
properties of the radio emission. The spectral indices for the relics steepen
from their outer edges towards the cluster centre and the electric field
vectors are approximately perpendicular to the major axes of the relics. The
results are consistent with the picture that these relics trace large-scale
shocks propagating outwards during the merger. Assuming diffusive shock
acceleration (DSA), we obtain shock Mach numbers of $\mathcal{M}=2.4$ and $2.3$
for the northern and southern shocks, respectively. For $\mathcal{M}\lesssim3$
shocks, a pre-existing population of mildly relativistic electrons is required
to explain the brightness of the relics due to the high ($>10$ per cent)
particle acceleration efficiency required. However, for $\mathcal{M}\gtrsim4$
shocks the required efficiency is $\gtrsim1\%$ and $\gtrsim0.5\%$,
respectively, which is low enough for shock acceleration directly from the
thermal pool. We used the fractional polarization to constrain the viewing
angle to $\geqslant(53\pm3)^\circ$ and $\geqslant(39\pm5)^\circ$ for the
northern and southern shocks, respectively. We found no evidence for diffuse
emission in the cluster central region. If the halo spans the entire region
between the relics ($\sim1.8\,\text{Mpc}$) our upper limit on the power is
$P_\text{1.4 GHz}=(1.4\pm0.6)\times10^{23}\,\text{W}\text{Hz}^{-1}$ which is
approximately equal to the anticipated flux from a cluster of this mass.
However, if the halo is smaller than this, our constraints on the power imply
that the halo is underluminous.

that the Ni56 in the ejecta of SN 1991bg-like events is off-center by ~1000

D-branes, which also directly generates the instanton-induced charged field
theory operator. In this paper we describe the D-brane instanton backreaction
in terms of a combinatorial operation in the bipartite dimer diagram of the
original theory. Interestingly, the resulting theory is a general Bipartite
Field Theory (BFT), defined by a bipartite graph tiling a general (possibly
higher-genus) Riemann surface. This provides the first string theory
realization of such general BFTs. We study the general properties of the
resulting theories, including the construction of the higher-dimensional toric
diagrams and the interplay between backreaction and Seiberg duality. In cases
where the non-perturbative effects relate to complex deformations, we show that
the procedure reproduces and explains earlier existing combinatorial recipes.
The combinatorial operation and its properties generalize to an operation on
the class of general BFTs, even including boundaries, relating BFTs defined on
Riemann surfaces of different genus.

uncertainty in galaxy formation studies. Progress is hampered by the limited
empirical constraints outside the restricted environment of the Local Group. In
particular, the poorly-quantified time evolution of the molecular cloud
lifecycle, star formation, and feedback obstructs robust predictions on the
scales smaller than the disc scale height that are resolved in modern galaxy
formation simulations. We present a new statistical method to derive the
evolutionary timeline of molecular clouds and star-forming regions. By
quantifying the excess or deficit of the gas-to-stellar flux ratio around peaks
of gas or star formation tracer emission, we directly measure the relative
rarity of these peaks, which allows us to derive their lifetimes. We present a
step-by-step, quantitative description of the method and demonstrate its
practical application. The method's accuracy is tested in nearly 300
experiments using simulated galaxy maps, showing that it is capable of
constraining the molecular cloud lifetime and feedback time-scale to $<0.1$ dex
precision. Access to the evolutionary timeline provides a variety of additional
physical quantities, such as the cloud-scale star formation efficiency, the
feedback outflow velocity, the mass loading factor, and the feedback energy or
momentum coupling efficiencies to the ambient medium. We show that the results
are robust for a wide variety of gas and star formation tracers, spatial
resolutions, galaxy inclinations, and galaxy sizes. Finally, we demonstrate
that our method can be applied out to high redshift ($z\lesssim4$) with a
feasible time investment on current large-scale observatories. This is a major
shift from previous studies that constrained the physics of star formation and
feedback in the immediate vicinity of the Sun.

nebular dust attenuation, metallicity, and star formation rate (SFR). The
inferred parameters of the stellar population (reddening, age, SFR, and stellar
mass) are strongly dependent on the details of the assumed stellar population
model and the shape of the attenuation curve. Nebular reddening is generally
larger than continuum reddening, but with large scatter. Compared to local
galaxies, high-redshift galaxies have lower gas-phase metallicities (and/or
higher nebular excitation) at fixed nebular reddening, and higher nebular
reddening at fixed stellar mass, consistent with gas fractions that increase
with redshift. We find that continuum reddening is correlated with
$12+\log(\mathrm{O}/\mathrm{H})_{\mathrm{O3N2}}$ at $3.0\sigma$ significance,
whereas nebular reddening is correlated with only $1.1\sigma$ significance.
This may reflect the dependence of both continuum reddening and O3N2 on the
shape of the ionizing radiation field produced by the massive stars. Finally,
we show that H$\alpha$-based and SED-based estimates of SFR exhibit significant
scatter relative to one another, and agree on average only for particular
combinations of spectral synthesis models and attenuation curves. We find that
the SMC extinction curve predicts consistent SFRs if we assume the sub-solar
($0.14Z_{\odot}$) binary star models that are favored for high-redshift
galaxies.

mainly through giant-impacts with large planetary embryos. The Earth's Moon was
suggested to form through one of these impacts. However, since the proto-Earth
has experienced many giant-impacts, several moons are naturally expected to
form through a sequence of multiple (including smaller scale) impacts. Each
impact potentially forms a sub-Lunar mass moonlet that interacts
gravitationally with the proto-Earth and possibly with previously-formed
moonlets. Such interactions result in either moonlet-moonlet mergers, moonlet
ejections or infall of moonlets on the Earth. The latter possibility, leading
to low-velocity moonlet-Earth collisions is explored here for the first time.
We make use of SPH simulations and consider a range of moonlet masses,
collision impact-angles and initial proto-Earth rotation rates. We find that
grazing/tidal-collisions are the most frequent and produce comparable fractions
of accreted-material and debris. The latter typically clump in smaller moonlets
that can potentially later interact with other moonlets. Other collision
geometries are more rare. Head-on collisions do not produce much debris and are
effectively perfect mergers. Intermediate impact angles result in debris
mass-fractions in the range of 2-25% where most of the material is unbound.
Retrograde collisions produce more debris than prograde collisions, whose
fractions depend on the proto-Earth initial rotation rate. Moonfalls can
slightly change the rotation-rate of the proto-Earth. Accreted moonfall
material is highly localized, potentially explaining the isotopic
heterogeneities in highly siderophile elements in terrestrial rocks, and
possibly forming primordial super-continent topographic features. Our results
can be used for simple scaling laws and applied to n-body studies of the
formation of the Earth and Moon.

of astrophysical relevance results in a delay of galaxy formation. As a
consequence, such scenarios can be constrained using the global 21-cm
absorption signal initiated by the UV radiation of the first stars. The
Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionization Signature (EDGES)
recently reported the first detection of such an absorption signal at redshift
$\sim 17$. While its amplitude might indicate the need for new physics, we
solely focus on the timing of the signal to test non-cold DM models. Assuming
conservative limits for the stellar-to-baryon fraction ($f_{*}<0.03$) and for
the minimum cooling temperature ($T_{\rm vir}>10^3$ Kelvin) motivated by
radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, we are able to derive unprecedented
constraints on a variety of non-cold DM models. For example, the mass of
thermal warm DM is limited to $m_{\rm TH}>6.1$ keV, while mixed DM scenarios
(featuring a cold and a hot component) are constrained to a hot DM fraction
below 17 percent. The ultra-light axion DM model is limited to masses
$m_{a}>8\times10^{-21}$ eV, a regime where its wave-like nature is pushed far
below the kiloparsec scale. Finally, sterile neutrinos from resonant production
can be fully disfavoured as a dominant DM candidate. The results of this paper
show that the 21-cm absorption signal is a powerful discriminant of non-cold
dark matter, allowing for significant improvements over to the strongest
current limits. Confirming the result from EDGES is paramount in this context.

support the core accretion theory of planet formation, in which the cores of

planets are found around stars with a wide range of metallicities and occur
more frequently around lower mass stars. This indicates that planet formation
takes place in a wide range of environments, yet it is not clear why planets

collimated jets can circularly polarize light. In this work, we measured
circular polarization of two SLSNe-I with the FOcal Reducer and low dispersion

evidence of circularly polarized light, however, these non-detections do not
rule out the magnetar scenario as the powering engine for SLSNe-I. We calculate
the strength of the magnetic field and the expected circular polarization as a
function of distance from the magnetar, which decreases very fast.
Additionally, we observed no significant linear polarization for PS17bek at

observations in nearby galaxies resolve individual stars and provide us with

from simulations and observations is a crucial task. We introduce a novel
approach to consistently populate star particles with stars. We developed a
technique to generate a theoretical catalogue of mock stars whose
characteristics are derived from the properties of parent star particles from a
cosmological simulation. Also, a library of stellar evolutionary tracks and
synthetic spectra is used to mimic the photometric properties of mock stars.
The aim of this tool is to produce a database of synthetic stars from the
properties of parent star particles in simulations: such a database represents
the observable stellar content of simulated galaxies and allows a comparison as
accurate as possible with observations of resolved stellar populations. With
this innovative approach we are able to provide a colour-magnitude diagram from
a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. This method is flexible and can be
tailored to fit output of different codes used for cosmological simulations.
Also, it is of paramount importance with ongoing survey data releases (e.g.
GAIA and surveys of resolved stellar populations), and will be useful to
predict properties of stars with peculiar chemical features and to compare
predictions from hydrodynamical models with data of different tracers of

filament alignment displays a more complex trend changing from preferentially
parallel at low masses to preferentially perpendicular at high masses. This
""spin flip"" occurs at an average mass of $5\times10^{11}~h^{-1}M_\odot$. This

of magnitude between the thinnest and thickest filament samples. We also find
that the inner parts of haloes have a spin flip mass that is several times
smaller than that of the halo as a whole. These results confirm that recent
accretion is responsible for the complex behaviour of the halo spin - filament
alignment. Low-mass haloes mainly accrete mass along directions perpendicular
to their host filament and thus their spins tend to be oriented along the
filaments. In contrast, high-mass haloes mainly accrete along their host
filaments and have their spins preferentially perpendicular to them.
Furthermore, haloes located in thinner filaments are more likely to accrete

growing through the merging and accretion of smaller structures. Numerical
simulations predict that a fraction of their energy content is not yet
thermalized, mainly in the form of kinetic motions (turbulence, bulk motions).
Measuring the level of non-thermal pressure support is necessary to understand
the processes leading to the virialization of the gas within the potential well
of the main halo and to calibrate the biases in hydrostatic mass estimates. We
present high-quality measurements of hydrostatic masses and intracluster gas
fraction out to the virial radius for a sample of 12 nearby clusters with
available XMM-Newton and Planck data. We compare our hydrostatic gas fractions
with the expected universal gas fraction to constrain the level of non-thermal
pressure support. We find that hydrostatic masses require little correction and
infer a median non-thermal pressure fraction of $\sim6\%$ and $\sim10\%$ at
$R_{500}$ and $R_{200}$, respectively. Our values are lower than the
expectations of hydrodynamical simulations, possibly implying a faster
thermalization of the gas. If instead we use the mass calibration adopted by
the Planck team, we find that the gas fraction of massive local systems implies
a mass bias $1-b=0.85\pm0.05$ for SZ-derived masses, with some evidence for a
mass-dependent bias. Conversely, the high bias required to match Planck CMB and
cluster count cosmology is excluded by the data at high significance, unless
the most massive halos are missing a substantial fraction of their baryons.

mean masses of these bins using their stacked weak lensing signal. By modeling
the scaling relation as $\langle M_{\rm 200m}|\lambda,z\rangle = M_0
(\lambda/40)^F ((1+z)/1.35)^G$, we constrain the normalization of the scaling

error: shear and photometric redshift errors, cluster miscentering, cluster
member dilution of the source sample, systematic uncertainties in the modeling
of the halo--mass correlation function, halo triaxiality, and projection
effects. We discuss prospects for reducing this systematic error budget, which
dominates the uncertainty on $M_0$. Our result is in excellent agreement with,
but has significantly smaller uncertainties than, previous measurements in the

for precision cosmology and upcoming galaxy surveys such as LSST, Euclid and

paper, we explore streaming videos encoded using Scalable Video Coding scheme
(SVC) over highly variable bandwidth conditions such as cellular networks.
SVC's unique encoding scheme allows the quality of a video chunk to change
incrementally, making it more flexible and adaptive to challenging network
conditions compared to other encoding schemes. Our contribution is threefold.
First, we formulate the quality decisions of video chunks constrained by the
available bandwidth, the playback buffer, and the chunk deadlines as an
optimization problem. The objective is to optimize a novel QoE metric that
models a combination of the three objectives of minimizing the stall/skip
duration of the video, maximizing the playback quality of every chunk, and
minimizing the number of quality switches. Second, we develop Layered Bin
Packing (LBP) Adaptation Algorithm, a novel algorithm that solves the proposed
optimization problem. Moreover, we show that LBP achieves the optimal solution
of the proposed optimization problem with linear complexity in the number of
video chunks. Third, we propose an online algorithm (online LBP) where several
challenges are addressed including handling bandwidth prediction errors, and
short prediction duration. Extensive simulations with real bandwidth traces of
public datasets reveal the robustness of our scheme and demonstrate its
significant performance improvement as compared to the state-of-the-art SVC
streaming algorithms. The proposed algorithm is also implemented on a TCP/IP
emulation test bed with real LTE bandwidth traces, and the emulation confirms
the simulation results and validates that the algorithm can be implemented and
deployed on today's mobile devices.

properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) out to the virial radius for a
sample of 12 galaxy clusters selected from the Planck all-sky survey. We
determine the universal profiles of gas density, temperature, pressure, and

information from XMM and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich constraints from Planck to recover
thermodynamic properties out to 2 R500. We provide average functional forms for
the radial dependence of the main quantities and quantify the slope and
intrinsic scatter of the population as a function of radius. We find that gas
density and pressure profiles steepen steadily with radius, in excellent
agreement with previous observational results. Entropy profiles beyond R500
closely follow the predictions for the gravitational collapse of structures.
The scatter in all thermodynamical quantities reaches a minimum in the range
[0.2-0.8] R500 and increases outwards. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that
pressure is substantially more scattered than temperature and density. Our

an iron K line and its associated reflection spectrum which are lagged behind
the continuum variability by the light-travel time from the source to the disc.
The measured lag timescales in the iron band can be as short as $\sim R_g/c$,
where $R_g$ is the gravitational radius, which is often interpreted as evidence
for a very small continuum source close to the event horizon of a rapidly
spinning black hole. However, the short lags can also be produced by reflection
from more distant material, because the primary photons with no time-delay
dilute the time-lags caused by the reprocessed photons. We perform a
Monte-Carlo simulation to calculate the dilution effect in the X-ray
reverberation lags from a half-shell of neutral material placed at $100\,R_g$
from the central source. This gives lags of $\sim2\,R_g/c$, but the iron line
is a distinctly narrow feature in the lag-energy plot, whereas the data often
show a broader line. We show that both the short lag and the line broadening
can be reproduced if the scattering material is outflowing at $\sim0.1c$. The
velocity structure in the wind can also give shifts in the line profile in the
lag-energy plot calculated at different frequencies. Hence we propose that the
observed broad iron reverberation lags and shifts in profile as a function of
frequency of variability can arise from a disc wind at fairly large distances
from the X-ray source.

We consider both binary lens and binary source models and we explore their
degeneracies, some of which have not previously been recognized. There are two
families of binary lens solutions, one with a mass ratio
$q\approx4\times10^{-4}$ and a separation s~4.6 and the other with q~0.015 and
s~0.22, i.e, both have companions in the planetary regime. We search for
solutions by using Bayesian analysis that includes planet frequency as a prior
and find that the s~4.6 family is the preferred one with ~4 M_Uranus mass
planet on an orbit of ~10 AU. The degeneracies arise from a paucity of
information on the anomaly, demonstrating that high-cadence observations are
essential for characterizing wide-orbit microlensing planets. Hence, we predict
that the planned WFIRST microlensing survey will be less prone to these
degeneracies than the ongoing ground-based surveys. We discuss the known
low-mass, wide-orbit companions and we notice that for the largest projected
separations the mass ratios are either high (consistent with brown dwarf
companions) or low (consistent with Uranus analogs), but intermediate mass
ratios (Jupiter analogs on wide orbits) have not been detected to date, despite
the fact that the sensitivity to such planets should be higher than that of
Uranus analogs. This is therefore tentative evidence of the existence of a
massive ice giant desert at wide separations. On the other hand, given their
low intrinsic detection sensitivity, Uranus analogs may be ubiquitous.

properties of these distributions for different classes of models. When in the
Fokker-Planck equation the diffusion coefficient is positive (nonzero) and the
drift term is bounded, as in the case of a Brownian walker, both distributions
may exhibit a power-law decay with exponent -3/2 for intermediate times. We
discuss how the influence of an absorbing state changes this exponent. The
absorbing state is characterized by a vanishing diffusion coefficient and/or a
diverging drift term. Remarkably, the exponent of the Brownian walker class of
models is still found, as long as the departure and arrival regions are far
enough from the absorbing state, but the range of times where the power law is
observed narrows. Close enough to the absorbing point, though, a new exponent
may appear. The particular value of the exponent depends on the behavior of the
diffusion and the drift terms of the Fokker-Planck equation. We focus on the
case of a diffusion term vanishing linearly at the absorbing point. In this
case, the FP and FR distributions are similar to those of the voter model,
characterized by a power law with exponent -2. As an illustration of the
general theory, we compare it with exact analytical solutions and extensive

conditions even after long times, a phenomenon called many-body localization
(MBL). Numerous studies support the stability of the MBL phase in strongly
disordered one-dimensional systems. However, the situation is much less clear
when a small part of the system is ergodic, a scenario which also has important
implications for the existence of many-body localization in higher dimensions.
Here we address this question experimentally using a large-scale quantum
simulator of ultracold bosons in a two-dimensional optical lattice. We prepare
two-component mixtures of varying relative population and implement a disorder
potential which is only experienced by one of the components. The second
non-disordered ''clean'' component plays the role of a bath of adjustable size
that is collisionally coupled to the ''dirty'' component. Our experiments show
how the dynamics of the dirty component, which, when on its own, show strong
evidence of localization, become affected by the coupling to the clean
component. For a high clean population, the clean component appears to behave
as an effective bath for the system which leads to its delocalization, while
for a smaller clean population, the ability of the bath to destabilize the
system becomes strongly reduced. Our results reveal how a finite-sized quantum
system can bring another one towards thermalization, in a regime of complex
interplay between disorder, tunneling and intercomponent interactions. They
provide a new benchmark for effective theories aiming to capture the complex
physics of MBL in the weakly localized regime.

an ML framework based on a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a weighted
expectation maximization (WEM) algorithm is introduced to predict the potential
network congestion. Then, the optimal deployment of UAVs is studied to minimize
the transmit power needed to satisfy the communication demand of users in the
downlink, while also minimizing the power needed for UAV mobility, based on the
predicted cellular traffic. To this end, first, the optimal partition of
service areas of each UAV is derived, based on a fairness principle. Next, the
optimal location of each UAV that minimizes the total power consumption is
derived. Simulation results show that the proposed ML approach can reduce the
required downlink transmit power and improve the power efficiency by over 20%,

depend on the loading configuration adopted to drive the slider along the

above a critical size corresponding to the appearance of a localized

is a fingerprint of superlubricity, does not conflict with the possibility to
observe shear-induced localized commensurate regions at the contact interface.

average rank for linear ranking functions, however, the recently developed
SVM-PropRank method has shown that counterfactual inference techniques can be
used to provably overcome the distorting effect of presentation bias. Going
beyond this special case, this paper provides a general and theoretically
rigorous framework for counterfactual learning-to-rank that enables unbiased
training for a broad class of additive ranking metrics (e.g., Discounted
Cumulative Gain (DCG)) as well as a broad class of models (e.g., deep
networks). Specifically, we derive a relaxation for propensity-weighted
rank-based metrics which is subdifferentiable and thus suitable for
gradient-based optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this general
approach by instantiating two new learning methods. One is a new type of
unbiased SVM that optimizes DCG -- called SVM PropDCG --, and we show how the
resulting optimization problem can be solved via the Convex Concave Procedure
(CCP). The other is Deep PropDCG, where the ranking function can be an
arbitrary deep network. In addition to the theoretical support, we empirically
find that SVM PropDCG significantly outperforms existing linear rankers in

the idea that polymorphically typed System F programs preserve all relations
between inputs. But as Reynolds himself later showed, his theory can only be
formalized in a meta-theory with an impredicative universe, such as the
Calculus of Inductive Constructions. Abstracting from Reynolds' ideas, Dunphy
and Reddy developed their well-known framework for parametricity that uses
parametric limits in reflexive graph categories and aims to subsume a variety
of parametric models. As we observe, however, their theory is not sufficiently
general to subsume the very model that inspired parametricity, namely Reynolds'
original model, expressed inside type theory. To correct this, we develop an
abstract framework for relational parametricity that generalizes the notion of
a reflexive graph categories and delivers Reynolds' model as a direct instance
in a natural way. This framework is uniform with respect to a choice of
meta-theory, which allows us to obtain the well-known PER model of Longo and
Moggi as a direct instance in a natural way as well. In addition, we offer two
novel relationally parametric models of System F: i) a categorical version of
Reynolds' model, where types are functorial on isomorphisms and all polymorphic
functions respect the functorial action, and ii) a proof-relevant categorical
version of Reynolds' model (after Orsanigo), where, additionally, witnesses of
relatedness are themselves suitably related. We show that, unlike previously
existing frameworks for parametricity, ours recognizes both of these new models
in a natural way. Our framework is thus descriptive, in that it accounts for
well-known models, as well as prescriptive, in that it identifies abstract
properties that good models of relational parametricity should satisfy and
suggests new constructions of such models.

instantiating meta-rules, which is implemented by the Metagol system based on
Prolog. Viewing MIL-problems as combinatorial search problems, they can
alternatively be solved by employing Answer Set Programming (ASP), which may
result in performance gains as a result of efficient conflict propagation.
However, a straightforward ASP-encoding of MIL results in a huge search space
due to a lack of procedural bias and the need for grounding. To address these
challenging issues, we encode MIL in the HEX-formalism, which is an extension
of ASP that allows us to outsource the background knowledge, and we restrict
the search space to compensate for a procedural bias in ASP. This way, the
import of constants from the background knowledge can for a given type of
meta-rules be limited to relevant ones. Moreover, by abstracting from term
manipulations in the encoding and by exploiting the HEX interface mechanism,
the import of such constants can be entirely avoided in order to mitigate the
grounding bottleneck. An experimental evaluation shows promising results.

provided a route to compact frequency combs of high repetition rate, which have
already been employed for optical frequency synthesizers, ultrafast ranging,
coherent telecommunication and dual-comb spectroscopy. Silicon nitride
(Si$_3$N$_4$) microresonators are promising for photonic integrated soliton
microcombs. Yet to date, soliton formation in Si$_3$N$_4$ microresonators at
electronically detectable repetition rates, typically less than 100 GHz, is
hindered by the requirement of external power amplifiers, due to the low
quality ($Q$) factors, as well as by thermal effects which necessitate the use
of frequency agile lasers to access the soliton state. These requirements
complicate future photonic integration, heterogeneous or hybrid, of soliton
microcomb devices based on Si$_3$N$_4$ microresonators with other active or
passive components. Here, using the photonic Damascene reflow process, we
demonstrate ultralow-power single soliton formation in high-Q
($Q_0>15\times10^6$) Si$_3$N$_4$ microresonators with 9.8 mW input power (6.2
mW in the waveguide) for devices of electronically detectable, 99 GHz
repetition rate. We show that solitons can be accessed via simple, slow laser
piezo tuning, in many resonances in the same sample. These power levels are
compatible with current silicon-photonics-based lasers for full photonic
integration of soliton microcombs, at repetition rates suitable for
applications such as ultrafast ranging and coherent communication. Our results
show the technological readiness of Si$_3$N$_4$ optical waveguides for future
all-on-chip soliton microcomb devices.

  Cyber-Physical Systems",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Securing cyber-physical systems (CPS) against malicious attacks is of
paramount importance because these attacks may cause irreparable damages to
physical systems. Recent studies have revealed that control programs running on
CPS devices suffer from both control-oriented attacks (e.g., code-injection or
code-reuse attacks) and data-oriented attacks (e.g., non-control data attacks).
Unfortunately, existing detection mechanisms are insufficient to detect runtime
data-oriented exploits, due to the lack of runtime execution semantics
checking. In this work, we propose Orpheus, a new security methodology for
defending against data-oriented attacks by enforcing cyber-physical execution
semantics. We first present a general method for reasoning cyber-physical
execution semantics of a control program (i.e., causal dependencies between the
physical context and program control flows), including the event identification
and dependence analysis. As an instantiation of Orpheus, we then present a new
program behavior model, i.e., the event-aware finite-state automaton (eFSA).
eFSA takes advantage of the event-driven nature of CPS control programs and
incorporates event checking in anomaly detection. It detects data-oriented
exploits if a specific physical event is missing along with the corresponding
event dependent state transition. We evaluate our prototype's performance by
conducting case studies under data-oriented attacks. Results show that eFSA can
successfully detect different runtime attacks. Our prototype on Raspberry Pi
incurs a low overhead, taking 0.0001s for each state transition integrity
checking, and 0.063s~0.211s for the cyber-physical contextual consistency
checking.

of problems. The first problem is related to random graph statistics. We
consider a certain class of Galton-Watson random trees and look at the total
height statistic. We provide an automated procedure for computing values of the
moments of this statistic.
  Next, we investigate several problems related to lattice paths staying below
a line of rational slope. These results are largely data-based. Using the
generated data, we are able to find recurrences for the number of such paths
for the cases of slopes 3/2 and 5/2. There is also investigation of a
generalization of these problems to three dimensions.
  We also examine generalizations of Sister Celine's method and Gosper's
algorithm for evaluating summations. For both, we greatly extend the classes of
applicable functions and applications to proving, or reproving in an automated
way, interesting combinatorial problems. For the generalization of Sister
Celine's method, we allow summations of arbitrary products of hypergeometric
terms and linear recurrent sequences with rational coefficients.
  We also show a partial result related to the bunk bed conjecture, a problem
concerning random finite graphs. Let $G$ be a finite graph. Remove edges from
$G\square K_2$ independently and with the same probability. In $G\square K_2$,
there is an edge placed between all vertices of $G$ and the corresponding
vertex in a copy of $G$. Then, label these vertices as either $(v,0)$ or
$(v,1)$ for each $v\in V(G)$. The conjecture says that for any $x,y \in V(G)$,
it is least as likely to have $(x,0)$ connected to $(y,0)$ as to have $(x,0)$
connected to $(y,1)$. We prove the conjecture in the case that only two of the
edges going between the two copes of $G$ are retained.

distinguish many-body quantum phases, it is usually hard to quantify the amount
of entanglement in mixed states of open quantum systems, while measuring
entanglement experimentally, even for the closed systems, requires in general
quantum state tomography. In this work we show how to remedy this situation in
system with a fixed or conserved charge, e.g., density or magnetization, due to
an emerging relation between quantum correlations and coherence. First, we show
how, in these cases, the presence of multipartite entanglement or quantumness
can be faithfully witnessed simply by detecting coherence in the quantum
system, while bipartite entanglement or bipartite quantum discord are implied
by asymmetry (block coherence) in the system. Second, we prove that the
relation between quantum correlations and coherence is also quantitative.
Namely, we establish upper and lower bounds on the amount of multipartite and
bipartite entanglement in a many-body system with a fixed local charge, in
terms of the amount of coherence and asymmetry present in the system.
Importantly, both for pure and mixed quantum states, these bounds are expressed
as closed formulas, and furthermore, for bipartite entanglement, are
experimentally accessible by means of the multiple quantum coherence spectra.
In particular, in one-dimensional systems, our bounds may detect breaking of
the area law of entanglement entropy. We illustrate our results on the example
of a many-body localized system, also in the presence of dephasing.

  Methods and Materials: The proton center at our institution uses a Hitachi
PROBEAT V synchrotron that delivers beams with energies ranging from 70 to 230
MeV to five treatment rooms, four of which have gantries and one fixed beam.
For this study, the magnetic field strengths of all optics in the transport
line were varied to measure the dispersion of 230 MeV beams in each of the four
gantry rooms. Beam position was measured using the Spot Position Monitor (SPM),
a multi-wire proportional counter (MWPC) in the nozzle approximately 0.5 meters
upstream of the treatment isocenter. Measured beam positions as a function of
momentum offset were fitted to a linear function to extract dispersion. In one
gantry, dispersions for 70 and 140 MeV beams were also measured. Because spot
position is continuously monitored during treatments and a position deviation
will abort the beam delivery, the dispersion at the spot position monitor was
used to set an upper limit of range uncertainty originating from momentum
deviation. When dispersion was approximately zero, dose rate measurements were
used to set an upper limit of momentum deviation that could reach the patient.
  Results: Dispersion was 0.45 m, 0.48 m and 0.30 m for 70 MeV, 140 MeV, and
230 MeV beams in a gantry, respectively, corresponding to 0.3 mm, 1.0 mm and
3.5 mm maximum range uncertainty during treatments. For 230 MeV beams,
dispersion ranged from 0 to 0.73 m across the four gantries, corresponding to
the upper limits of range uncertainty due to momentum deviation of 1.4 to 6.2
mm (0.4 to 1.9% in fractional range uncertainty).
  Conclusions: The measured dispersion was both energy- and gantry-dependent
and ranged from 0 to 0.73 m.

roles for uni- and multiflagellar swimmers. For a uniflagellar swimmer, hook
and/or flagellar buckling occurs above a critical flexibility relative to the
torque exerted by the flagellar motor. Addition of a second flagellum greatly
expands the parameter regime of stable locomotion, because flexible hooks that
would lead to buckling instability in the uniflagellar case provide the
flexibility required for flagellar bundling in the biflagellar case. Similar
observations hold for tri- and quadriflagellar swimmers. Indeed the stability
regimes for uni- and quadriflagellar swimming are virtually inverted -- to a
first approximation what is stable in one case is unstable in the other.
Swimming speed is also examined: it increases very weakly with number of
flagella and a simple theory is developed that explains this observation.

semimetallic candidates PdTe$_{2}$ and PtTe$_{2}$ \emph{via} the temperature
and the angular dependence of the de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) and Shubnikov-de
Haas (SdH) effects. In high quality single crystals of both compounds, i.e.
displaying carrier mobilities between $10^3$ and $10^4$ cm$^2$/Vs, we observed
a large non-saturating magnetoresistivity (MR) which in PtTe$_2$ at a
temperature $T = 1.3$ K, leads to an increase in the resistivity up to $5
\times 10^{4}$ % under a magnetic field $\mu_0 H = 62$ T. These high mobilities
correlate with their light effective masses in the range of 0.04 to 1 bare
electron mass according to our measurements. For PdTe$_{2}$ the experimentally
determined Fermi surface cross-sectional areas show an excellent agreement with
those resulting from band-structure calculations. Surprisingly, this is not the
case for PtTe$_{2}$ whose agreement between calculations and experiments is
relatively poor even when electronic correlations are included in the
calculations. Therefore, our study provides a strong support for the existence
of a Dirac type-II node in PdTe$_2$ and probably also for PtTe$_2$. Band
structure calculations indicate that the topologically non-trivial bands of
PtTe$_2$ do not cross the Fermi-level ($\varepsilon_F$). In contrast, for
PdTe$_2$ the Dirac type-II cone does intersect $\varepsilon_F$, although our
calculations also indicate that the associated cyclotron orbit on the Fermi
surface is located in a distinct $k_z$ plane with respect to the one of the
Dirac type-II node. Therefore it should yield a trivial Berry-phase.

close-in gas giants. Most of them have weaker than expected spectral features
in the $1.1-1.7\mu m$ bandpass probed by HST/WFC3 but stronger spectral
features at longer wavelengths probed by Spitzer. This led previous authors to
puzzling conclusions about the thermal structures and chemical abundances of
these planets. Using the SPARC/MITgcm, we investigate how thermal dissociation,
ionization, H$^-$ opacity and clouds shape the thermal structures and spectral
properties of ultra hot Jupiters with a special focus on WASP-121b. We expand
our findings to the whole population of ultra hot Jupiters through analytical
quantification of the thermal dissociation and its influence on the strength of
spectral features.
  We predict that most molecules are thermally dissociated and alkalies are
ionized in the dayside photospheres of ultra hot Jupiters. This includes
H$_{\rm 2}$O, TiO, VO, and H$_{\rm 2}$ but not CO, which has a stronger
molecular bond. The vertical molecular gradient created by the dissociation
significantly weakens the spectral features from water while the $4.5\mu m$ CO
feature remain unchanged. The water band in the HST/WFC3 bandpass is further
weakened by H$^-$ continuum opacity. Molecules are expected to recombine before
reaching the limb, leading to order of magnitude variations of the chemical
composition and cloud coverage between the limb and the dayside. Overall,
molecular dissociation provides a qualitative understanding of the lack of
strong spectral feature of water in the $1-2\mu m$ bandpass observed in most
ultra hot Jupiters. Quantitatively, however, our model does not provide a
satisfactory match to the WASP-121b emission spectrum. Together with WASP-33b
and Kepler-33Ab, they seem the outliers among the population of ultra hot
Jupiters in need of a more thorough understanding.

local operators over a null line. However for non-integer J, light-ray
operators are genuinely nonlocal and give the analytic continuation of CFT data
in spin described by Caron-Huot. A key role in our construction is played by a
novel set of intrinsically Lorentzian integral transforms that generalize the
shadow transform. Matrix elements of light-ray operators can be computed via
the integral of a double-commutator against a conformal block. This gives a
simple derivation of Caron-Huot's Lorentzian OPE inversion formula and lets us
generalize it to arbitrary four-point functions. Furthermore, we show that
light-ray operators enter the Regge limit of CFT correlators, and generalize
conformal Regge theory to arbitrary four-point functions. The average null
energy operator is an important example of a light-ray operator. Using our
construction, we find a new proof of the average null energy condition (ANEC),

escape the interstellar medium, is adjusted to match observations of the

mass-star formation rate relation of galaxies; the number density and
metallicity of damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) at $z\sim5$; the
abundance of weak metal absorbers; the ultraviolet background (UVB) amplitude;
and the Lyman-$\alpha$ flux power spectrum at $z=5.4$. The galaxy stellar mass
and UV luminosity functions are underproduced by $\leq2\times$, suggesting an
overly vigorous feedback model. The mean transmission in the Lyman-$\alpha$
forest is underproduced at $z<6$, indicating tension between measurements of
the UVB amplitude and Lyman-$\alpha$ transmission. The observed SiIV column
density distribution is reasonably well-reproduced ($\sim 1\sigma$ low). By
contrast, CIV remains significantly underproduced despite being boosted by an
intense $>4$ Ryd UVB. Solving this problem by increasing metal yields would
overproduce both weak absorbers and DLA metallicities. Instead, the observed
strength of high-ionization emission from high-redshift galaxies and absorption
from their environments suggest that the ionizing flux from conventional
stellar population models is too soft.

molecular dynamics (NEMD) using the so-called direct method are known to be
severely under-predicted since finite simulation length-scales are unable to

by means of thermostatting tends to impact phonon transport adversely.
Additionally, NEMD predictions are tightly coupled with the choice of the
inter-atomic potential and the underlying values associated with its
parameters. In the case of silicon (Si), nominal estimates of the
Stillinger-Weber (SW) potential parameters are largely based on a constrained
regression approach aimed at agreement with experimental data while ensuring
structural stability. However, this approach has its short-comings and it may
not be ideal to use the same set of parameters to study a wide variety of
Si-based systems subjected to different thermodynamic conditions. In this
study, NEMD simulations are performed on a Si bar to investigate the impact of
bar-length, and the applied thermal gradient on the discrepancy between
predictions and the available measurement for bulk thermal conductivity at 300
K by constructing statistical response surfaces at different temperatures. The
approach helps quantify the discrepancy, observed to be largely dependent on
the system-size, with minimal computational effort. A computationally efficient
approach based on derivative-based sensitivity measures to construct a
reduced-order polynomial chaos surrogate for NEMD predictions is also
presented. The surrogate is used to perform parametric sensitivity analysis,
forward propagation of the uncertainty, and calibration of the important SW
potential parameters in a Bayesian setting. It is found that only two (out of
seven) parameters contribute significantly to the uncertainty in bulk thermal

dependence at the level of individual values. On the other extreme are
coarse-grained type systems (like HLIO) that track dependence coarsely, by
associating a single label with an entire computation context and not labeling
all values individually.

styles are, in fact, equally expressive. To do this, we show a semantics- and
type-preserving translation from a coarse-grained type system to a fine-grained

translation is: It requires a construct to arbitrarily limit the scope of a
context label in the coarse-grained type system (e.g., HLIO's ""toLabeled""
construct). As a separate contribution, we show how to extend work on logical

a zero preference recommendation is a valid solution for most common objective

zero preference recommendation for most of the available items. In this paper
we propose a novel objective function, the \emph{Missing Information Loss}

competitive performance in ranking-aware metrics when applied to three

obtained while displaying popular items less frequently (up to a $20 \%$
decrease with respect to the best competing method). This debiasing from the
recommendation of popular items favours the appearance of infrequent items (up

capabilities in comparison to traditional rigid-bodied robots. A subclass of
soft fluid-driven actuators known as fiber reinforced elastomeric enclosures
(FREEs) is particularly well suited as actuators for these types of systems.
FREEs are inherently soft and can impart spatial forces without imposing a
rigid structure. Furthermore, they can be configured to produce a large variety
of force and moment combinations. In this paper we explore the potential of
combining multiple differently configured FREEs in parallel to achieve fully
controllable multi-dimensional soft actuation. To this end, we propose a novel
methodology to represent and calculate the generalized forces generated by soft
actuators as a function of their internal pressure. This methodology relies on
the notion of a state dependent fluid Jacobian that yields a linear expression
for force. We employ this concept to construct the set of all possible forces
that can be generated by a soft system in a given state. This force zonotope
can be used to inform the design and control of parallel combinations of soft
actuators. The approach is verified experimentally with the parallel

morphologies, ranging from homogeneous to turbulent configurations. A
Sedov-Taylor explosion in a homogeneous magnetic field generates an oblate
ellipsoidal shock surface due to the slower propagating blast wave in the
direction of the magnetic field. This is because of the efficient cosmic ray
(CR) production in the quasi-parallel polar cap regions, which softens the
equation of state and increases the compressibility of the post-shock gas. We
find that the solution remains self-similar because the ellipticity of the
propagating blast wave stays constant in time. This enables us to derive an
effective ratio of specific heats for a composite of thermal gas and CRs as a
function of the maximum acceleration efficiency. We finally discuss the
behavior of supernova remnants expanding into a turbulent magnetic field with

Since the shape of their luminosity function is sensitive to the characteristic
cooling time, it is possible to use its slope to test the existence of
additional sources or sinks of energy, such as those predicted by alternative
physical theories. The aim of this paper is to study if the changes in the
slope of the white dwarf luminosity function around bolometric magnitudes
ranging from 8 to 10 and previously attributed to axion emission are,
effectively, a consequence of the existence of axions and not an artifact
introduced by the star formatio rate. We compute theoretical luminosity
functions of the thin and thick disk, and of the stellar halo including axion
emission and we compare them with the existing observed luminosity functions.
Since these stellar populations have different star formation histories, the
slope change should be present in all of them at the same place if it is due to
axions or any other intrinsic cooling mechanism. The signature of an unexpected
cooling seems to be present in the luminosity functions of the thin and thick
disks, as well as in the halo luminosity function. This additional cooling is
compatible with axion emission, thus supporting the idea that DFSZ axions, with
a mass in the range of 4 to 10 meV, could exist. If this were the case, these
axions could be detected by the future solar axioscope IAXO.

ratio, a strong vortical structure forms on the leeside of the sharp blade
edge. This has unexpected effects on blade aerodynamics. A differential onset
velocity gradient due to rotor rotation creates an envelope of reverse flow
extending from the hub. A Sharp Edge Vortex (SEV) is observed at the geometric
trailing edge, forming soon after the blade enters the retreating-blade side.
The SEV grows radially inwards in size and strength as the blade retreats. The
SEV convects and evolves along with the rotor blade until dissipation. In this
paper, a coherent vortex is observed at 240 degrees azimuth. Vortex size and
strength increase as the blade retreats, ceasing to grow before 270 degrees.
The reverse flow envelope increases at higher advance ratios with increased
vortical strength. The solid body rotation core of the vortex stretches at
lower advance ratios and shows the signs of a burst vortex in the dissipation
phase. The proximity of the SEV to the blade causes large excursions in surface
static pressures which in turn generates significant negative lift on the
retreating blade. The attached, coherent sharp edge vortex shows similar
morphological features as the leading edge vortex on a delta wing.

microbursts of Crab pulsar, which is an active GP emitter, zebra-pattern-like
spectral structures are observed, which are reminiscent of the `zebra bands'
that are observed in type IV solar radio flares. However, band spacing linearly
increases with the band center frequency of $\sim5-30$\,GHz. In this study, we
propose that the Crab pulsar GP can originate from the coherent instability of
plasma near a light cylinder. Further, the growth of coherent instability can
be attributed to the resonance observed between the cyclotron-resonant-excited
wave and the background plasma oscillation. The particles can be injected into
the closed-field line regions owing to magnetic reconnection near a light
cylinder. These particles introduce a large amount of free energy that further
causes cyclotron-resonant instability, which grows and amplifies radiative
waves at frequencies close to the electron cyclotron harmonics that exhibit
zebra-pattern-like spectral band structures. Further, these structures can be
modulated by the resonance between the cyclotron-resonant-excited wave and the
background plasma oscillation. In this scenario, the band structures of the
Crab pulsar can be well fitted by a coherent instability model, where the
plasma density of a light cylinder should be $\sim10^{13-15}\,\rm{cm^{-3}}$,
with an estimated gradient of $>5.5\times10^5\,\rm{cm^{-4}}$. This process may
be accompanied by high-energy emissions. Similar phenomena are expected to be
detected in other types of GP sources that have magnetic fields of
$\simeq10^6$\,G in a light cylinder.

of integrating user feedback, improving retrieval results. However, most

which limits their impact. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to
interactive image search that enables users to provide feedback via natural
language, allowing for more natural and effective interaction. We formulate the
task of dialog-based interactive image retrieval as a reinforcement learning
problem, and reward the dialog system for improving the rank of the target
image during each dialog turn. To mitigate the cumbersome and costly process of
collecting human-machine conversations as the dialog system learns, we train
our system with a user simulator, which is itself trained to describe the
differences between target and candidate images. The efficacy of our approach
is demonstrated in a footwear retrieval application. Experiments on both
simulated and real-world data show that 1) our proposed learning framework
achieves better accuracy than other supervised and reinforcement learning
baselines and 2) user feedback based on natural language rather than
pre-specified attributes leads to more effective retrieval results, and a more
natural and expressive communication interface.

external memory augments the representation of hidden states of traditional
recurrent neural networks through storing more context information. To update

distribution falls with a given probability. In a centralized setting where the
cumulative distribution function (CDF) is unknown, the empirical CDF (ECDF) can
be used to estimate such quantiles after aggregating the data. In a fully
distributed sensor network, however, it is challenging to estimate quantiles.
This is because each sensor node observes local measurement data with limited
storage and data transmission power which make it difficult to obtain the
global ECDF. This paper proposes consensus-based quantile estimation for such a
distributed network. The states of the proposed algorithm are recursively
updated with two-steps at each iteration: one is a local update based on the
measurement data and the current state, and the other is averaging the updated
states with neighboring nodes. We consider the realistic case of communication
links between nodes being corrupted by independent random noise. It is shown
that the estimated state sequence is asymptotically unbiased and converges
toward the sample quantile in the mean-square sense. The two step-size
sequences corresponding to the averaging and local update steps result in a
mixed-time scale algorithm with proper decay rates in order to achieve
convergence. We also provide applications to distributed estimation of trimmed
mean, computation of median, maximum, or minimum values and identification of

starting from the static semantics developed in recent work on Hazelnut. We
model incomplete functional programs as expressions with holes, with empty
holes standing for missing expressions or types, and non-empty holes operating
as membranes around static and dynamic type inconsistencies. Rather than
aborting when evaluation encounters any of these holes as in some existing
systems, evaluation proceeds around holes, tracking the closure around each
hole instance as it flows through the remainder of the program. Editor services
can use the information in these hole closures to help the programmer develop
and confirm their mental model of the behavior of the complete portions of the
program as they decide how to fill the remaining holes. Hole closures also
enable a fill-and-resume operation that avoids the need to restart evaluation
after edits that amount to hole filling. Formally, the semantics borrows
machinery from both gradual type theory (which supplies the basis for handling
unfilled type holes) and contextual modal type theory (which supplies a logical
basis for hole closures), combining these and developing additional machinery
necessary to continue evaluation past holes while maintaining type safety. We
have mechanized the metatheory of the core calculus, called Hazelnut Live,
using the Agda proof assistant.
  We have also implemented these ideas into the Hazel programming environment.
The implementation inserts holes automatically, following the Hazelnut edit
action calculus, to guarantee that every editor state has some (possibly
incomplete) type. Taken together with this paper's type safety property, the
result is a proof-of-concept live programming environment where rich dynamic
feedback is truly available without gaps, i.e. for every reachable editor
state.

points (APs) in high-density wireless networks with both channel fading and
flow-level dynamics, where each incoming flow has a certain amount of service
demand and leaves the system once its service request is complete (referred as
flow-level dynamic model). The efficient load-balancing design is strongly
needed for supporting high-quality wireless connections in high-density areas.
Despite the presence of a variety of earlier works on the design and analysis
of the load-balancing schemes in wireless networks, there does not exist a work
on the load-balancing design in the realistic flow-level dynamic model.
  In this work, we propose a Join-the-Least-Workload (JLW) Algorithm that
always forwards the incoming flows to the AP with the smallest workload in the
presence of flow-level dynamics. However, our considered flow-level dynamic
model differs from traditional queueing model for wireless networks in the
following two aspects: (1) the dynamics of the flows is short-term and flows
will leave the network once they received the desired amount of service; (2)
each individual flow faces an independent channel fading. These differences
pose significant challenges on the system performance analysis. To tackle these
challenges, we perform Lyapunov-drift-based analysis of the stochastic network
taking into account sharp flow-level dynamics. Our analysis reveals that our
proposed JLW Algorithm not only achieves maximum system throughput, but also
minimizes the total system workload in heavy-traffic regimes. Moreover, we
observe from both our theoretical and simulation results that the mean total
workload performance under the proposed JLW Algorithm does not degrade as the
number of APs increases, which is strongly desirable in high-density wireless
networks.

an optimization problem with x-ray spectrum as unknown variables, and a
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence constraint is employed to incorporate prior
knowledge of the spectrum and enhance numerical stability of the estimation
process. The formulated constrained optimization problem is convex and can be
solved efficiently by use of the exponentiated-gradient (EG) algorithm. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the simulated and
experimental data. The comparison to the expectation-maximization (EM) method
is also discussed. In simulations, the proposed algorithm is seen to yield
x-ray spectra that closely match the ground truth and represent the attenuation
process of x-ray photons in materials, both included and not included in the
estimation process. In experiments, the calculated transmission curve is in
good agreement with the measured transmission curve, and the estimated spectra
exhibits physically realistic looking shapes. The results further show the
comparable performance between the proposed optimization-based approach and EM.
In conclusion, our formulation of a constrained optimization provides an
interpretable and flexible framework for spectrum estimation. Moreover, a
KL-divergence constraint can include a prior spectrum and appears to capture
important features of x-ray spectrum, allowing accurate and robust estimation

selection graph neural network (GNN), which replaces linear time invariant
filters with linear shift invariant graph filters to generate convolutional
features and reinterprets pooling as a possibly nonlinear subsampling stage
where nearby nodes pool their information in a set of preselected sample nodes.
A key component of the architecture is to remember the position of sampled
nodes to permit computation of convolutional features at deeper layers. The
second architecture, dubbed aggregation GNN, diffuses the signal through the
graph and stores the sequence of diffused components observed by a designated
node. This procedure effectively aggregates all components into a stream of
information having temporal structure to which the convolution and pooling
stages of regular CNNs can be applied. A multinode version of aggregation GNNs
is further introduced for operation in large scale graphs. An important
property of selection and aggregation GNNs is that they reduce to conventional
CNNs when particularized to time signals reinterpreted as graph signals in a

this compound? To study these properties, here we employ a combination of
ab-initio band structure, tight-binding model, and an effective quantum field
theory. Within a density-functional theory (DFT) calculation, we find an
unexpected bulk Dirac cone without spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Tracing back to
its origin, we identify, for the first time, the presence of a
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) like dimerized Cu chain lying in the 3D crystal
structure. The SSH chain, combined with SOC, stipulates an anisotropic 3D Dirac
cone where chiral and helical states are intertwined. As a Heisenberg
interaction is introduced, we show that the dimerized Cu sublattices of the SSH
chain condensate into spin-singlet, dimerized magnets. In the magnetic ground
state, we also find a topological phase, distinguished by the axion angle.
Finally, to study how the topological axion term couples to magnetic
excitations, we derive a Chern-Simons-Ginzburg-Landau action from the 3D SSH
Hamiltonian. We find that axion term provides an additional mass term to the
Higgs mode, and a lifetime to paramagnons, which are independent of the quantum
critical physics. The axion-Higgs interplay can be probed with electric and
magnetic field applied parallel or anti-parallel to each other.

The lepto-quark $X^{\pm 2/3}_{\mu}$ corresponding to gauge group $ SU(2)_X$
allows the quark-lepton transitions and hence giving a framework to construct
the effective Lagrangian for the LFV decays. The mass of lepto-quark $m_{X}$

conversational interfaces are becoming increasingly popular around the world.
Retrieval-based conversation models have the advantages of returning fluent and
informative responses. Most existing studies in this area are on open domain
""chit-chat"" conversations or task / transaction oriented conversations. More
research is needed for information-seeking conversations. There is also a lack
of modeling external knowledge beyond the dialog utterances among current
conversational models. In this paper, we propose a learning framework on the
top of deep neural matching networks that leverages external knowledge for
response ranking in information-seeking conversation systems. We incorporate
external knowledge into deep neural models with pseudo-relevance feedback and
QA correspondence knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments with three
information-seeking conversation data sets including both open benchmarks and
commercial data show that, our methods outperform various baseline methods
including several deep text matching models and the state-of-the-art method on
response selection in multi-turn conversations. We also perform analysis over
different response types, model variations and ranking examples. Our models and
research findings provide new insights on how to utilize external knowledge
with deep neural models for response selection and have implications for the
design of the next generation of information-seeking conversation systems.

avoiding an edge $e$, where $s \in S$ and $t \in V$. When $\sigma=n$,
Demetrescu, Thorup, Chowdhury and Ramachandran (SIAM Journal of Computing,
2008) designed an algorithm with $\tilde O(n^2)$ space ($\tilde O(\cdot)$ hides
poly $\log n$ factor.) and $O(1)$ query time. A natural open question is to
generalize this result to any number of sources. Recently, Bil{\`o} et. al.
(STACS 2018) designed a data-structure of size $\tilde O(\sigma^{1/2}n^{3/2})$
with the query time of $O(\sqrt{n\sigma})$ for the above problem. We improve
their result by designing a data-structure of size $\tilde O(\sigma^{1/2}
n^{3/2})$ that can answer queries in $\tilde O(1)$ time.
  In a related problem of finding fault tolerant subgraph, Parter and Peleg
(ESA 2013) showed that if detours of the {\em replacement} paths ending at a
vertex $t$ are disjoint, then the number of such paths is $O(\sqrt{n\sigma})$.
This eventually gives a bound of $O( n \sqrt{n \sigma}) =
O(\sigma^{1/2}n^{3/2})$ for their problem. {\em Disjointness of detours} is a
very crucial property used in the above result. We show a similar result for a
subset of replacement path which \textbf{may not} be disjoint. This result is
the crux of our paper and may be of independent interest.?

give a generalized way to obtain numerical advantage in the sense of
reconditioning to check the fusion frame condition. For this end, we introduce
the notion of Q-duality for Controlled fusion frames. Also, we survey the
robustness of Controlled fusion frames under some perturbations.

output represents an important feedback mechanism capable of halting accretion

reached widely varying conclusions about the effectiveness of this feedback. In
this paper I show that much of the divergence in the literature is a result of
failure to obey an important resolution criterion: whether radiation feedback
is able to reverse an accretion flow is determined on scales comparable to the
dust destruction radius, which is $\lesssim 1000$ AU even for the most luminous
stellar sources. Simulations that fail to resolve this scale can produce
unphysical results, in many cases leading to a dramatic overestimate of the
effectiveness of radiation feedback. Most published simulations of radiation
feedback on molecular cloud and galactic scales fail to satisfy this condition.
I show how the problem can be circumvented by introducing a new subgrid model
that explicitly accounts for momentum balance on unresolved scales, making it
possible to simulate dusty accretion flows safely even at low resolution.

small quantum systems is the celebrated Clausius inequality form of the second
law. However, its application to small quantum systems suffers from two
cardinal problems: (i) The Clausius inequality does not hold when the system
and environment are initially correlated - a commonly encountered scenario in
microscopic setups. (ii) In some other cases, the Clausius inequality does not
provide any useful information (e.g. in dephasing scenarios). We address these
deficiencies by developing the notion of global passivity and employing it as a
tool for deriving thermodynamic inequalities on observables. For initially
uncorrelated thermal environments the global passivity framework recovers the
Clausius inequality. More generally, global passivity provides an extension of
the Clausius inequality that holds even in the presences of strong initial
system-environment correlations. Crucially, the present framework provides
additional thermodynamic bounds on expectation values. To illustrate the role
of the additional bounds we use them to detect unaccounted heat leaks and weak
feedback operations (""Maxwell's demons"") that the Clausius inequality cannot
detect. In addition, it is shown that global passivity can put practical upper
and lower bounds on the buildup of system-environment correlation for dephasing
interactions. Our findings are highly relevant for experiments in various
systems such as ion traps, superconducting circuits, atoms in optical cavities

so-called ultimate regime, in which the boundary layers (BL) are of turbulent

10^{13}-10^{14}$ a transition in the scaling of the global Nusselt number $Nu$
(the dimensionless heat transfer) and the Reynolds number with $Ra$ has been
observed in experiments and very recently in direct numerical simulations (DNS)
of two-dimensional (2D) RB. In this paper we analyse the local scaling
properties of the lateral temperature structure functions in the BLs of this
simulation of 2D RB, employing extended self-similarity (ESS) (i.e., plotting
the structure functions against each other, rather than only against the scale)
in the spirit of the attached eddy hypothesis, as we have recently introduced
for velocity structure functions in wall turbulence (Krug \textit{et al.},
\textit{J. Fluid Mech.}, vol. 830, 2017, pp. 797-819). We find no ESS scaling
below the transition and in the near wall region. However, beyond the
transition and for large enough wall distance $z^+ > 100$, we find clear ESS
behaviour, as expected for a scalar in a turbulent boundary layer. In striking
correspondence to the $Nu$ scaling, the ESS scaling region is negligible at $Ra
= 10^{11}$ and well developed at $Ra = 10^{14}$, thus providing strong evidence
that the observed transition in the global Nusselt number at $Ra \approx
10^{13}$ indeed is the transition from a laminar type BL to a turbulent type
BL. Our results further show that the relative slopes for scalar structure
functions in the ESS scaling regime are the same as for their velocity
counterparts extending their previously established universality. The findings
are confirmed by comparing to scalar structure functions in 3D turbulent
channel flow.

To address these issues, a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs)

objective is divided into three sub-objectives: object localization,
segmentation and matching transformation. Object localization step establishes
an initial correspondence between the images. A modified version of single shot

solved by determining the collision-free path that satisfies the chosen
criteria for shortest distance and path smoothness. The proposed path planning
algorithm mimics the real world by adding the actual size of the mobile robot
to that of the obstacles and formulating the problem as a moving point in the
free-space. The proposed algorithm consists of three modules. The first module
forms an optimized path by conducting a hybridized Particle Swarm
Optimization-Modified Frequency Bat (PSO-MFB) algorithm that minimizes distance
and follows path smoothness criteria. The second module detects any infeasible
points generated by the proposed hybrid PSO-MFB Algorithm by a novel Local
Search (LS) algorithm integrated with the hybrid PSO-MFB algorithm to be
converted into feasible solutions. The third module features obstacle detection
and avoidance (ODA), which is triggered when the mobile robot detects obstacles
within its sensing region, allowing it to avoid collision with obstacles. The
simulation results indicate that this method generates an optimal feasible path
even in complex dynamic environments and thus overcomes the shortcomings of
conventional approaches such as grid methods. Moreover, compared to recent path
planning techniques, simulation results show that the proposed hybrid PSO-MFB
algorithm is highly competitive in terms of path optimality.

attracted substantial research attention from both wireless industry and

two-dimensional active antenna system (AAS) that not only allows a large number
of antenna elements to be placed within feasible base station (BS) form
factors, but also provides the ability of adaptive electronic beam control over
both the elevation and the traditional azimuth dimensions. This paper presents
a tutorial on elevation beamforming analysis for cellular networks utilizing FD
Massive MIMO antenna arrays. In contrast to existing works that focus on the
standardization of FD-MIMO in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP),
this tutorial is distinguished by its depth with respect to the theoretical
aspects of antenna array and 3D channel modeling. In an attempt to bridge the
gap between industry and academia, this preliminary tutorial introduces the
relevant array and transceiver architecture designs proposed in the 3GPP
Release 13 that enable elevation beamforming. Then it presents and compares two
different 3D channel modeling approaches that can be utilized for the
performance analysis of elevation beamforming techniques. The spatial
correlation in FD-MIMO arrays is characterized and compared based on both
channel modeling approaches and some insights into the impact of different
channel and array parameters on the correlation are drawn. All these aspects
are put together to provide a mathematical framework for the design of
elevation beamforming schemes in single-cell and multi-cell scenarios.
Simulation examples associated with comparisons and discussions are also
presented. To this end, this paper highlights the state-of-the-art research and
points out future research directions.

find a solution of differential equations for master integrals in the form of
an $\epsilon$-expansion series with numerical coefficients. The algorithm is
based on using generalized power series expansions near singular points of the
differential system, solving difference equations for the corresponding
coefficients in these expansions and using matching to connect series
expansions at two neighboring points. Here we use our algorithm and the
corresponding code for our example of four-loop generalized sunset diagrams
with three massive and two massless propagators, in order to obtain new
analytical results. We analytically evaluate the master integrals at threshold,
$p^2=9 m^2$, in an expansion in $\epsilon$ up to $\epsilon^1$. With the help of
our code, we obtain numerical results for the threshold master integrals in an
$\epsilon$-expansion with the accuracy of 6000 digits and then use the PSLQ
algorithm to arrive at analytical values. Our basis of constants is build from
bases of multiple polylogarithm values at sixth roots of unity.

bright ears to the southwest and northeast, although the main shell outside the
ears is roughly circular. Based on an earlier proposal that the supernova
ejecta has a jet component with extra energy, the dynamical evolution of the
remnant is solved using 3D hydrodynamical (HD) simulation to investigate the
formation of the periphery of the remnant. Assuming the ejecta with a kinetic
energy of $10^{51}$\,erg and a mass of $3~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ evolved in a
uniform ambient medium for a time of $\sim 4000$\,yr and the jet component has
cylindrical symmetry with a half open angle of $10^\circ$, the result indicates
that the energy contained in the jet is about $10-15\%$ of the kinetic energy
of the entire ejecta to reproduce the detected profile. This study supports
that the remnant originated from a jet-driven core-collapse supernova.

stellar astrophysics and exoplanet research has been the lack of precise radii
and evolutionary states for most of the observed stars. We report revised radii
of 177,911 $Kepler$ stars derived by combining parallaxes from $Gaia$ Data
Release 2 with the DR25 $Kepler$ Stellar Properties Catalog. The median radius
precision is $\approx$ 8%, a typical improvement by a factor of 4-5 over
previous estimates for typical $Kepler$ stars. We find that $\approx$ 67%
($\approx$ 120,000) of all $Kepler$ targets are main-sequence stars, $\approx$
21% ($\approx$ 37,000) are subgiants, and $\approx$ 12% ($\approx$ 21,000) are
red giants, demonstrating that subgiant contamination is less severe than some
previous estimates and that Kepler targets are mostly main-sequence stars.
Using the revised stellar radii, we recalculate the radii for 2123 confirmed
and 1922 candidate exoplanets. We confirm the presence of a gap in the radius
distribution of small, close-in planets, but find that the gap is mostly
limited to incident fluxes $>$ 200$F_\oplus$ and its location may be at a
slightly larger radius (closer to $\approx$ 2$R_\oplus$) when compared to
previous results. Further, we find several confirmed exoplanets occupying a
previously-described ""hot super-Earth desert"" at high irradiance, show the
relation between gas-giant planet radius and incident flux, and establish a
bona-fide sample of eight confirmed planets and 30 planet candidates with
$R_{\mathrm{p}}$ $<$ 2$R_\oplus$ in circumstellar ""habitable zones"" (incident

human and machine vision. In this paper, we present a novel approach for
translating an object photo to a sketch, mimicking the human sketching process.
This is an extremely challenging task because the photo and sketch domains
differ significantly. Furthermore, human sketches exhibit various levels of
sophistication and abstraction even when depicting the same object instance in
a reference photo. This means that even if photo-sketch pairs are available,
they only provide weak supervision signal to learn a translation model.
Compared with existing supervised approaches that solve the problem of
D(E(photo)) -> sketch, where E($\cdot$) and D($\cdot$) denote encoder and
decoder respectively, we take advantage of the inverse problem (e.g.,
D(E(sketch)) -> photo), and combine with the unsupervised learning tasks of
within-domain reconstruction, all within a multi-task learning framework.
Compared with existing unsupervised approaches based on cycle consistency
(i.e., D(E(D(E(photo)))) -> photo), we introduce a shortcut consistency
enforced at the encoder bottleneck (e.g., D(E(photo)) -> photo) to exploit the
additional self-supervision. Both qualitative and quantitative results show
that the proposed model is superior to a number of state-of-the-art
alternatives. We also show that the synthetic sketches can be used to train a
better fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) model, effectively
alleviating the problem of sketch data scarcity.

oriented surface, $L$ is a framed, colored link in $\Sigma \times S^1$, and $G$
is a simple, simply-connected, compact Lie group. We demonstrate that the torus
gauge approach allows a rather quick explicit evaluation of $Z(\Sigma \times
S^1,L)$. Moreover, we verify in several special cases that the explicit values
obtained for $Z(\Sigma \times S^1,L)$ agree with the values of the

corresponding Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant. If this is indeed the case then
this could lead to progress towards the solution of several open questions in

solve the word-trigger mismatch problem by directly proposing entire trigger

NPNs perform event detection in a character-wise paradigm, where a hybrid

character compositional structures of Chinese event triggers. Experiments on

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and dual learning. However, existing
models lack the ability to control the translated results in the target domain

usually leads to (almost) deterministic translation result. In this paper, we
study a new problem, conditional image-to-image translation, which is to
translate an image from the source domain to the target domain conditioned on a
given image in the target domain. It requires that the generated image should
inherit some domain-specific features of the conditional image from the target
domain. Therefore, changing the conditional image in the target domain will
lead to diverse translation results for a fixed input image from the source
domain, and therefore the conditional input image helps to control the
translation results. We tackle this problem with unpaired data based on GANs
and dual learning. We twist two conditional translation models (one translation
from A domain to B domain, and the other one from B domain to A domain)
together for inputs combination and reconstruction while preserving domain
independent features. We carry out experiments on men's faces from-to women's

large effort to study seller revenue maximization, following Myerson's seminal
work, both theoretically and practically. We take the point of view of the
buyer in classical auctions and ask the question of whether she has an
incentive to shade her bid even in auctions that are reputed to be truthful,
when aware of the revenue optimization mechanism.
  We show that in auctions such as the Myerson auction or a VCG with reserve
price set as the monopoly price, the buyer who is aware of this information has
indeed an incentive to shade. Intuitively, by selecting the revenue maximizing
auction, the seller introduces a dependency on the buyers' distributions in the
choice of the auction. We study in depth the case of the Myerson auction and
show that a symmetric equilibrium exists in which buyers shade non-linearly
what would be their first price bid. They then end up with an expected payoff
that is equal to what they would get in a first price auction with no reserve
price.
  We conclude that a return to simple first price auctions with no reserve
price or at least non-dynamic anonymous ones is desirable from the point of
view of both buyers, sellers and increasing transparency.

Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of aromatic thiols were grown on the gold film

simultaneously stitching the CNM edges to the edges of graphene and MoS2,

transport in complex materials. The lattice thermal conductivity can be
computed either using the Green-Kubo formula in equilibrium MD (EMD)
simulations or using Fourier's law in nonequilibrium MD (NEMD) simulations.
These two methods have not been systematically compared for materials with
different dimensions and inconsistencies between them have been occasionally
reported in the literature. Here we give an in-depth comparison of them in
terms of heat transport in three allotropes of Si: three dimensional bulk
silicon, two-dimensional silicene, and quasi-one-dimensional silicon nanowire.
By multiplying the correlation time in the Green-Kubo formula with an
appropriate effective group velocity, we can express the running thermal
conductivity in the EMD method as a function of an effective length and
directly compare it with the length-dependent thermal conductivity in the NEMD
method. We find that the two methods quantitatively agree with each other for
all the systems studied, firmly establishing their equivalence in computing
thermal conductivity.

to a number of constrained optimization problems. Many of them adopt mutation

do not explicitly utilise features of fitness landscapes. To improve the
performance of algorithms, this paper aims at designing a search operator
adapting to fitness landscapes. Through an observation, we find that principle
component analysis (PCA) can be used to characterise fitness landscapes. Based
on this finding, a new search operator, called PCA-projection, is proposed. In
order to verify the effectiveness of PCA-projection, we design two algorithms
enhanced with PCA-projection for solving constrained optimization problems,
called PMODE and HECO-PDE, respectively. Experiments have been conducted on the
IEEE CEC 2017 competition benchmark suite in constrained optimisation. PMODE
and HECO-PDE are compared with the algorithms from the IEEE CEC 2018
competition and another recent MOEA for constrained optimisation. Experimental
results show that an algorithm enhanced with PCA-projection performs better
than its corresponding opponent without this operator. Furthermore, HECO-PDE is
ranked first on all dimensions according to the competition rules. This study
reveals that decomposition-based MOEAs, such as HECO-PDE, are competitive with
best single-objective and multiobjective evolutionary algorithms for
constrained optimisation, but MOEAs based on non-dominance, such as PMODE, may

view of the MW bulge stellar population properties with unprecedented accuracy.
This in turn allows us to explore the correlation between kinematics and
stellar density distribution, crucial to constraint the models of Galactic
bulge formation. GIBS revealed the presence of a velocity dispersion peak in
the central few degrees of the Galaxy by consistently measuring high velocity
dispersion in three central most fields. Due to suboptimal distribution of
these fields, all being at negative latitudes and close to each other, the
shape and extension of the sigma peak is poorly constrained. In this study we
address this by adding new observations distributed more uniformly and in
particular including fields at positive latitudes that were missing in
GIBS.MUSE observations were collected in four fields at
(l,b)=(0,+2),(0,-2),(+1,-1),(-1,+2). Individual stellar spectra were extracted
for a number of stars comprised between ~500 and ~1200, depending on the seeing
and the exposure time. Velocity measurements are done by cross-correlating
observed stellar spectra in the CaT region with a synthetic template, and
velocity errors obtained through Monte Carlo simulations, cross-correlating
synthetic spectra with a range of different metallicities and different noise
characteristics. We measure the central velocity dispersion peak within a
projected distance from the Galactic center of ~280pc, reaching sigma~140 km/s
at b=-1. This is in agreement with the results obtained previously by GIBS at
negative longitude. The central sigma peak is symmetric with respect to the
Galactic plane, with a longitude extension at least as narrow as predicted by
GIBS. As a result of the Monte Carlo simulations we present analytical
equations for the Rvel measurement error as a function of metallicity and SNR
for giant and dwarf stars.

research of high-temperature superconductivity. In particular, whether the
pseudogap is associated with a crossover or phase transition has been a
long-standing controversial issue. The tetragonal cuprate
HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$, with only one CuO$_2$ layer per primitive cell, is an
ideal system to tackle this puzzle. Here, we measure the anisotropy of magnetic
susceptibility within the CuO$_2$ plane with exceptionally high-precision
magnetic torque experiments. Our key finding is that a distinct two-fold
in-plane anisotropy sets in below the pseudogap temperature $T^*$, which
provides thermodynamic evidence for a nematic phase transition with broken
four-fold symmetry. Most surprisingly, the nematic director orients along the
diagonal direction of the CuO$_2$ square lattice, in sharp contrast to the bond
nematicity reported in various iron-based superconductors and double-layer
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+\delta}$, where the anisotropy axis is along the Fe-Fe and
Cu-O-Cu directions, respectively. Another remarkable feature is that the
enhancement of the diagonal nematicity with decreasing temperature is
suppressed around the temperature at which short-range charge-density-wave
(CDW) formation occurs. This is in stark contrast to
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+\delta}$, where the bond nematicity is not influenced by the
CDW. Our result suggests a competing relationship between diagonal nematic and

vertical currents - to 15 active regions that span a wide range of magnetic
conditions. We use a distance metric to assess how well each of these models is
able to match field lines to the 12,202 loops traced in coronal images. These
distances are typically 1-2"". We also compute the misalignment angle between
each traced loop and the local magnetic field vector, and find values of
5-12$^\circ$. We find that the NLFF models generally outperform the potential

changes in obliquity and eccentricity cause the ice edge, the lowest latitude
extent of the ice caps, to become unstable and grow to the equator. We apply an
analytical theory of the ice edge latitude to show that obliquity is the
primary driver of the instability. The thermal inertia of the ice sheets and
the spectral energy distribution of the G dwarf star increase the sensitivity
of the model to triggering runaway glaciation. Finally, we apply a machine

two charged Higgs bosons $H^\pm$. We first show that the parameter space of
HTM0, usually delimited by combined constraints originating from unitarity and
BFB as well as experimental limits from LEP and LHC, is severely reduced when
the modified Veltman conditions at one loop are also imposed. Then, we perform
an rigorous analysis of Higgs decays either when $h^0$ is the SM-like or when
the heaviest neutral Higgs $H^0$ is identified to the observed $125$ GeV Higgs
boson at LHC. In these scenarios, we perform an extensive parameter scan, in
the lower part of the scalar mass spectrum, with a particular focus on the
Higgs to Higgs decay modes $H^0 \to h^0h^0, H^\pm\,H^\mp$ leading predominantly
to invisible Higgs decays. Finally, we also study the scenario where $h^0, H^0$
are mass degenerate. We thus find that consistency with LHC signal strengths
favours a light charged Higgs with a mass about $176\sim178$ GeV.
  Our analysis shows that the diphoton Higgs decay mode and $H \to Z \gamma$
are not always positively correlated as claimed in a previous study.
Anti-correlation is rather seen in the scenario where $h$ is SM like, while
correlation is sensitive to the sign of the potential parameter $\lambda$ when

task to benefit from generalizations learned for others. In this paper we
tackle the challenging task of improving semantic parsing performance, taking
UCCA parsing as a test case, and AMR, SDP and Universal Dependencies (UD)
parsing as auxiliary tasks. We experiment on three languages, using a uniform
transition-based system and learning architecture for all parsing tasks.
Despite notable conceptual, formal and domain differences, we show that
multitask learning significantly improves UCCA parsing in both in-domain and

a giant planet, and a massless secondary, say a terrestrial planet or an
asteroid, which moves under their gravitational attraction. We study the
dynamics of this system in the framework of the circular and elliptic
restricted TBP, when the motion of the giant planet describes circular and
elliptic orbits, respectively. Originating from the circular family, families
of symmetric periodic orbits in the 3/2, 5/2, 3/1, 4/1 and 5/1 mean-motion
resonances are continued in the circular and the elliptic problems. New
bifurcation points from the circular to the elliptic problem are found for each
of the above resonances and thus, new families, continued from these points are
herein presented. Stable segments of periodic orbits were found at high
eccentricity values of the already known families considered as whole unstable
previously. Moreover, new isolated (not continued from bifurcation points)
families are computed in the elliptic restricted problem. The majority of the
new families mainly consist of stable periodic orbits at high eccentricities.
The families of the 5/1 resonance are investigated for the first time in the
restricted three-body problems. We highlight the effect of stable periodic
orbits on the formation of stable regions in their vicinity and unveil the
boundaries of such domains in phase space by computing maps of dynamical
stability. The long-term stable evolution of the terrestrial planets or
asteroids is dependent on the existence of regular domains in their dynamical
neighbourhood in phase space, which could host them for long time spans. This
study, besides other celestial architectures that can be efficiently modelled
by the circular and elliptic restricted problems, is particularly appropriate
for the discovery of terrestrial companions among the single-giant planet
systems discovered so far.

  theory",,,,,"cs.LO cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Just like any other branch of mathematics, denotational semantics of
programming languages should be formalised in type theory, but adapting
traditional domain theoretic semantics, as originally formulated in classical
set theory to type theory has proven challenging. This paper is part of a
project on formulating denotational semantics in type theories with guarded
recursion. This should have the benefit of not only giving simpler semantics
and proofs of properties such as adequacy, but also hopefully in the future to
scale to languages with advanced features, such as general references, outside
the reach of traditional domain theoretic techniques. Working in Guarded
Dependent Type Theory (GDTT), we develop denotational semantics for FPC, the
simply typed lambda calculus extended with recursive types, modelling the
recursive types of FPC using the guarded recursive types of GDTT. We prove
soundness and computational adequacy of the model in GDTT using a logical
relation between syntax and semantics constructed also using guarded recursive
types. The denotational semantics is intensional in the sense that it counts
the number of unfold-fold reductions needed to compute the value of a term, but
we construct a relation relating the denotations of extensionally equal terms,
i.e., pairs of terms that compute the same value in a different number of
steps. Finally we show how the denotational semantics of terms can be executed
inside type theory and prove that executing the denotation of a boolean term
computes the same value as the operational semantics of FPC.

advent of powerful computers, it is now possible to train the machine to learn
complex patterns in the data, which may not be easily realized using the
traditional methods. Among the various machine learning methods, the artificial
neural networks (ANNs) have received enormous attention. A variant of ANNs,
autoassociative neural network (autoNN) tries to learn the reconstruction of
input itself using backpropagation. In an autoNN, the input and output are the
same, and an approximation to the identity mapping is obtained in a nonlinear
setting. AutoNNs have primarily been used to extract sparse internal
representations of any input and reduce its dimensionality. In this paper, we
explore the potential of autoNNs in reducing random noise in geophysical data.
In this paper, the first results of this study are presented. The synthetic
mathematical example demonstrates the concept of autoNN. For the test seismic
data, it is observed that autoNN can significantly remove the vertical time-
and frequency-local noise, however, the resolution of the output signal is
compromised to a certain extent. Future work includes testing larger examples
with several different types of noise, and using deep-stacked-autoNNs to
further reduce the noise, ensuring minimal compromise with the resolution of
the signal.

observing multiple quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in the post-merger signal. Current
methods to achieve this goal rely on matching the data with a superposition of
exponentially damped sinusoids with amplitudes fitted to numerical-relativity
(NR) simulations of binary black-hole (BBH) mergers. These models presume the
ability to correctly estimate the time at which the gravitational-wave (GW)
signal starts to be dominated by the QNMs of a perturbed BH. Here we show that
this difficulty can be overcome by using multipolar inspiral-merger-ringdown
waveforms, calibrated to NR simulations, as already developed within the
effective-one-body formalism (EOBNR). We build a parameterized (nonspinning)
EOBNR waveform model in which the QNM complex frequencies are free parameters
(pEOBNR), and use Bayesian analysis to study its effectiveness in measuring
QNMs in GW150914, and in synthetic GW signals of BBHs injected in Gaussian
noise. We find that using the pEOBNR model gives, in general, stronger
constraints compared to the ones obtained when using a sum of damped sinusoids
and using Bayesian model selection, we also show that the pEOBNR model can
successfully be employed to find evidence for deviations from General
Relativity in the ringdown signal. Since the pEOBNR model properly includes
time and phase shifts among QNMs, it is also well suited to consistently
combine information from several observations --- e.g., we find on the order of
$\sim 30$ GW150914-like BBH events would be needed for Advanced LIGO and Virgo
at design sensitivity to measure the fundamental frequencies of both the

directed graphs. In addition to computing the non-commutative curve-counting

consistent with the flat, low-frequency part of the power spectrum measured
previously in Mrk 335. The UV-optical structure functions of Mrk 335 are
comparable with those of other Seyfert 1 galaxies and of Mrk 335 itself when it
was in a normal bright state. There is no indication that the current X-ray
low-flux state is attributed to changes in the accretion disc structure of Mrk
335. The characteristic timescales measured in the structure functions can be
attributed to thermal (for the UV) and dynamic (for the optical) timescales in
a standard accretion disc. The high-quality UVW2 (~1800 A in the source frame)
structure function appears to have two breaks and two different slopes between
10-160 days. Correlations between the X-ray and other bands are not highly
significant when considering the entire 11-year light curves, but more
significant behaviour is present when considering segments of the light curves.
A correlation between the X-ray and UVW2 in 2014 (Year-8) may be predominately
caused by an giant X-ray flare that was interpreted as jet-like emission. In
2008 (Year-2), possible lags between the UVW2 emission and other UV-optical

renormalisation scheme that is hybrid between on-shell SM-like renormalised
parameters and running $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ Wilson coefficients. The
resulting amplitude is then finite, renormalisation scale invariant,
independent of the gauge choice ($\xi$) and respects SM Ward identities.
Remarkably, the $S$-matrix amplitude calculation resembles very closely the one
usually known from renormalisable theories and can be automatised to a high
degree. We use this gauge invariant amplitude and recent LHC data to check upon
sensitivity to various Wilson coefficients entering from a more complete theory
at the matching energy scale. We present a closed expression for the ratio
$\mathcal{R}_{h\to \gamma\gamma}$, of the Beyond the SM versus the SM

important contributions arise at tree level from the operators $Q_{\varphi B},
Q_{\varphi W}, Q_{\varphi WB}$, and at one-loop level from the dipole operators
$Q_{uB},Q_{uW}$. Our calculation shows also that, for operators that appear at
tree level in SMEFT, one-loop corrections can modify their contributions by
less than 10%. Wilson coefficients corresponding to these five operators are
bounded from current LHC $h\to \gamma\gamma$ data -- in some cases an order of

standing wave, and partially synchronized states and reveal bistability
regions. When we turn our attention to the asymmetric case we find that the
symmetry-breaking complicates the bifurcation diagram. For instance, a
pitchfork bifurcation in the symmetric case is broken, giving rise to a Hopf

target $a\in\mathbb{R}$ with known distribution $\mu$. The searcher begins at
the origin and performs Brownian motion with diffusion constant $D$. The
searcher is also armed with an exponential clock with spatially dependent rate
$r$, so that if it has failed to locate the target by the time the clock rings,
then its position is reset to the origin and it continues its search anew from
there. Denote the position of the searcher at time $t$ by $X(t)$. Let
$E_0^{(r)}$ denote expectations for the process $X(\cdot)$.
  The search ends at time $T_a=\inf\{t\ge0:X(t)=a\}$. The expected time of the

quantitative growth rates for $E_0^{(r)}T_a$ as a function of $a$ in terms of
the asymptotic behavior of the rate function $r$, and also a rather precise
dichotomy on the asymptotic behavior of the resetting function $r$ to determine

Citizens participate in mass demonstrations to express themselves and exercise

it is important to predict such demonstrations in advance to safeguard against
such damages. Recent research has shown that about 75 percent of protests that
are regarded as legal, are planned in advance. Twitter, the prominent
micro-blogging website, has been used as a tool by protestors for planning,
organizing, and announcing many of the recent protests worldwide such as those
that led to the Arab Spring, Britain riots, and those against Mr. Trump after
the presidential election in the U.S. In this paper, we aim to predict protests
by means of machine learning algorithms. In particular, we consider the case of
protests against the then-president-elect Mr. Trump after the results of the
presidential election were announced in November 2016. We first identify the
hashtags calling for demonstration from Trending Topics on Twitter, and
download the corresponding tweets. We then apply four machine learning
algorithms to make predictions. Our findings indicate that Twitter can be used
as a powerful tool for predicting future protests with an average prediction
accuracy of over 75 percent (up to 100 percent). We further validate our model
by predicting the protests held in the U.S. airports after President Trump's
executive order banning citizens of seven Muslim countries from entering the

both indicate that there is a first-order phase transition in the spreading

internal memory instead of outside DRAM. It classifies 224x224 RGB image inputs
at more than 140fps with peak power consumption at less than 300mW and an
accuracy comparable to the VGG benchmark. The CNN-DSA accelerator is
reconfigurable to support CNN model coefficients of various layer sizes and
layer types, including convolution, depth-wise convolution, short-cut
connections, max pooling, and ReLU. Furthermore, in order to better support
real-world deployment for various application scenarios, especially with
low-end mobile and embedded platforms and MCUs (Microcontroller Units), we also

  Neighboring Flares: SDO/AIA Observations and 3D MHD Modeling","The Astrophysical Journal, in press",,"10.3847/1538-4357/aac2e8",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since their discovery by SDO/AIA in EUV, rapid (phase speeds of 1000 km/s),
quasi-periodic, fast-mode propagating wave trains (QFPs) have been observed
accompanying many solar flares. They typically propagate in funnel-like
structures associated with the expanding magnetic field topology of the active
regions (ARs). The waves provide information on the associated flare pulsations
and the magnetic structure through coronal seismology. The reported waves
usually originate from a single localized source associated with the flare.
Here, we report the first detection of counter-propagating QFPs associated with
two neighboring flares on 2013 May 22, apparently connected by large-scale,
trans-equatorial coronal loops. We present the first results of 3D MHD model of
counter-propagating QFPs an idealized bi-polar AR. We investigate the
excitation, propagation, nonlinearity, and interaction of the
counter-propagating waves for a range of key model parameters, such as the
properties of the sources and the background magnetic structure. In addition to
QFPs, we also find evidence of trapped fast (kink) and slow mode waves
associated with the event. We apply coronal seismology to determine the
magnetic field strength in an oscillating loop during the event. Our model
results are in qualitative agreement with the AIA-observed counter propagating
waves and are used to identify the various MHD wave modes associated with the
observed event providing insights into their linear and nonlinear interactions.
Our observations provide the first direct evidence of counter-propagating fast
magnetosonic waves that can potentially lead to turbulent cascade and carry
significant energy flux for coronal heating in low-corona magnetic structures.

task on a dataset without the need for human annotation. The main objective,
however, is to transfer this model to a target domain and task. Currently, the
most effective transfer strategy is fine-tuning, which restricts one to use the
same model or parts thereof for both pretext and target tasks. In this paper,
we present a novel framework for self-supervised learning that overcomes
limitations in designing and comparing different tasks, models, and data

allows us to: 1) quantitatively assess previously incompatible models including
handcrafted features; 2) show that deeper neural network models can learn
better representations from the same pretext task; 3) transfer knowledge

omics annotation. The inclusion of this information in the analysis may enhance
classification performance and feature selection, but is not straightforward in
the standard regression setting. As a solution to this problem, we propose a
group-regularized (logistic) elastic net regression method, where each penalty
parameter corresponds to a group of features based on the external information.
The method, termed gren, makes use of the Bayesian formulation of logistic
elastic net regression to estimate both the model and penalty parameters in an
approximate empirical-variational Bayes framework. Simulations and an
application to a colon cancer microRNA study show that, if the partitioning of
the features is informative, classification performance and feature selection
are indeed enhanced.

  one is faster?",,,"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.07.020",,"physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A two-compartment model of diffusion in white matter, which accounts for
intra- and extra-axonal spaces, is associated with two plausible mathematical
scenarios: either the intra-axonal axial diffusivity is higher than the
extra-axonal (Branch 1), or the opposite (Branch 2). This duality calls for an
independent validation of compartment axial diffusivities, to determine which
of the two cases holds. The aim of the present study was to use an
intracerebroventricular injection of a gadolinium-based contrast agent to
selectively reduce the extracellular water signal in the rat brain, and compare
diffusion metrics in the genu of the corpus callosum before and after
gadolinium infusion. The diffusion metrics considered were diffusion and
kurtosis tensor metrics, as well as compartment-specific estimates of the
WMTI-Watson two-compartment model. A strong decrease in genu T1 and T2
relaxation times post-Gd was observed (p < 0.001), as well as an increase of
48% in radial kurtosis (p < 0.05), which implies that the relative fraction of
extracellular water signal was selectively decreased. This was further
supported by a significant increase in intra-axonal water fraction as estimated
from the two-compartment model, for both branches (p < 0.01 for Branch 1, p <
0.05 for Branch 2). However, pre-Gd estimates of axon dispersion in Branch 1
agreed better with literature than those of Branch 2. Furthermore, comparison
of post-Gd changes in diffusivity and dispersion between data and simulations
further supported Branch 1 as the biologically plausible solution, i.e. the
intra-axonal axial diffusivity is higher than the extra-axonal one. This result
is fully consistent with other recent measurements of compartment axial
diffusivities that used entirely different approaches, such as diffusion tensor
encoding.

characterize the set of admissible scattering states which produce finite tree

higher spins obeying two-derivative equations of motion. We use conformal

the usual spinor helicity formalism allows us to encode these scattering states
efficiently in terms of `twistor-spinors'. This leads to compact momentum space
expressions for all finite tree-level 3-point amplitudes of conformal higher

sensors, controllers, and actuators connected through a local cloud in order to
intelligently control physical devices. Because cloud services are vulnerable
to advanced persistent threats (APTs), each device in the IoCT must
strategically decide whether to trust cloud services that may be compromised.
In this paper, we present iSTRICT, an interdependent strategic trust mechanism
for the cloud-enabled IoCT. iSTRICT is composed of three interdependent layers.
In the cloud layer, iSTRICT uses FlipIt games to conceptualize APTs. In the
communication layer, it captures the interaction between devices and the cloud
using signaling games. In the physical layer, iSTRICT uses optimal control to
quantify the utilities in the higher level games. Best response dynamics link
the three layers in an overall ""game-of-games,"" for which the outcome is
captured by a concept called Gestalt Nash equilibrium (GNE). We prove the
existence of a GNE under a set of natural assumptions and develop an adaptive
algorithm to iteratively compute the equilibrium. Finally, we apply iSTRICT to
trust management for autonomous vehicles that rely on measurements from remote
sources. We show that strategic trust in the communication layer achieves a
worst-case probability of compromise for any attack and defense costs in the

problem I investigate is the problem of candour in the WPA slave narratives: it
is widely held in the historical community that the strict racial caste system
of the Deep South compelled black ex-slaves to tell white interviewers what
they thought they wanted to hear, suggesting that there was a significant
difference candour depending on whether their interviewer was white or black.
In this work, I attempt to quantitatively characterise this race-related
problem of candour. Prior work has either been of an impressionistic,
qualitative nature, or utilised exceedingly simple quantitative methodology. In
contrast, I use more sophisticated statistical methods: in particular word
frequency and sentiment analysis and comparative topic modelling with LDA to
try and identify differences in the content and sentiment expressed by
ex-slaves in front of white interviewers versus black interviewers. While my
sentiment analysis methodology was ultimately unsuccessful due to the
complexity of the task, my word frequency analysis and comparative topic
modelling methods both showed strong evidence that the content expressed in
front of white interviewers was different from that of black interviewers. In
particular, I found that the ex-slaves spoke much more about unfavourable
aspects of slavery like whipping and slave patrollers in front of interviewers
of their own race. I hope that my more-sophisticated statistical methodology
helps improve the robustness of the argument for the existence of this problem
of candour in the slave narratives, which some would seek to deny for
revisionist purposes.

comparison and ordering, (ii) the dependence in the arrival process and the
service process have a dual potency to influence the system performance, and
(iii) the manipulation of the dependence in the free dimensions of the arrival
or service process transforms the dependence structure of the arrival or
service process. In addition, we apply the theory to the Markov additive
process, which is a general model for a class of arrival processes and a
versatile model for wireless channel capacity, and derive a set of results for
various performance measures, including delay, backlog, and delay-constrained
capacity. To demonstrate the use of the theory, we focus on dependence
manipulation in wireless channel capacity, where we use copula to represent the
dependence structure of the underlying Markov process of wireless channel
capacity. We show that, based on a priori information of the temporal
dependence of the uncontrollable parameters and the spatial dependence between
the uncontrollable and controllable parameters, we can construct a sequence of
temporal copulas of the Markov process and obtain a sequence of transition
matrices of the controllable parameters to achieve the demanded dependence
properties of the wireless channel capacity. This dependence manipulation
technique is validated by simulation.

paradigm shift from Tobler's law to scaling law, from Euclidean geometry to
fractal geometry, from Gaussian statistics to Paretian statistics, and - more
importantly - from Descartes' mechanistic thinking to Alexander's organic
thinking. Fractal geometry falls under the third definition of fractal - that
is, a set or pattern is fractal if the scaling of far more small things than
large ones recurs multiple times (Jiang and Yin 2014) - rather than under the
second definition of fractal, which requires a power law between scales and
details (Mandelbrot 1982). The new fractal geometry is more towards living
geometry that ""follows the rules, constraints, and contingent conditions that
are, inevitably, encountered in the real world"" (Alexander et al. 2012, p.
395), not only for understanding complexity, but also for creating complex or
living structure (Alexander 2002-2005). This editorial attempts to clarify why
the paradigm shift is essential and to elaborate on several concepts, including
spatial heterogeneity (scaling law), scale (or the fourth meaning of scale),
data character (in contrast to data quality), and sustainable transport in the
big data era.

significant barriers or traps exist between different social or economic
strata; and two, the extent to which intergenerational outcomes do (or can be
used to) affect individual investment and consumption decisions. We develop a
model to explicitly relate these two questions, and prove the first such `rat
race' theorem, showing that a fundamental relationship exists between high
levels of individual investment and the existence of a wealth trap, which traps
otherwise identical agents at a lower level of wealth. Our simple model of
intergenerational wealth dynamics involves agents which balance current
consumption with investment in a single descendant. Investments then determine
descendant wealth via a potentially nonlinear and discontinuous competitiveness
function about which we do not make concavity assumptions. From this model we
demonstrate how to infer such a competitiveness function from investments,
along with geometric criteria to determine individual decisions. Additionally
we investigate the stability of a wealth distribution, both to local
perturbations and to the introduction of new agents with no wealth.

multi-channel networks (MCNs). These networks offer services such as brand
deals, equipment, and strategic advice in exchange for a share of the
YouTubers' revenue. A major strategy to gain more subscribers and, hence,
revenue is collaborating with other YouTubers. Yet, collaborations on YouTube
have not been studied in a detailed quantitative manner. This paper aims to
close this gap with the following contributions. First, we collect a YouTube
dataset covering video statistics over three months for 7,942 channels. Second,
we design a framework for collaboration detection given a previously unknown
number of persons featuring in YouTube videos. We denote this framework for the
analysis of collaborations in YouTube videos using a Deep Neural Network (DNN)
based approach as CATANA. Third, we analyze about 2.4 years of video content
and use CATANA to answer research questions providing guidance for YouTubers
and MCNs for efficient collaboration strategies. Thereby, we focus on (i)
collaboration frequency and partner selectivity, (ii) the influence of MCNs on
channel collaborations, (iii) collaborating channel types, and (iv) the impact
of collaborations on video and channel popularity. Our results show that
collaborations are in many cases significantly beneficial in terms of viewers
and newly attracted subscribers for both collaborating channels, showing often
more than 100% popularity growth compared with non-collaboration videos.
