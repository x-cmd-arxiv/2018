$\kappa$ holds if and only if $\kappa$ is supercomact. However, just like the
tree property, it can hold at successor cardinals. We show that ITP holds at
the successor of the limit of $\omega$ many supercompact cardinals. Then we
show that it can consistently hold at $\aleph_{\omega+1}$. We also consider a
stronger principle, ISP, and certain weaker variations of it. We determine
which level of ISP can hold at a successor of a singular. These results fit in
the broad program of testing how much compactness can exist in the universe,
and obtaining large cardinal-type properties at smaller cardinals.

series of time-sensitive tasks. One of the tasks involves picking up critical
resources (e.g., first aid kits, blankets, water) from warehouses and
delivering them to the affected people. To successfully deliver these items to
the people in need, the organization needs to make decisions that range from
the quick acquisition of vehicles from the local market, to the preparation of
pickup and delivery schedules and vehicle routes. During crises, the supply of
vehicles is often limited, their acquisition cost is steep, and special rental
periods are imposed. At the same time, the affected area needs the aid
materials as fast as possible, and deliveries must be made within due time.
Therefore, it is imperative that the decisions of acquiring, scheduling, and
routing of vehicles are made optimally and quickly. In this paper, we consider
a variant of a truckload open vehicle routing problem with time windows, which
is suitable for modeling vehicle routing operations during a humanitarian
crisis. We present two integer linear programming models to formulate the
problem, with the first one being an arc-based mixed integer linear programming
model. The second model is a path-based integer linear programming model, for
which we design two fast path generation algorithms. The first model is solved
exactly using the commercial solver, while we propose to solve the second model
within a column generation framework. Finally, we perform numerical experiments
and compare the results obtained from the two models. We show that the
path-based model, when solved with our column generation algorithm, outperforms
the arc-based model in terms of solution time without sacrificing the solution
quality.

element in both of these, accounting for approximately half of the present day
greenhouse effect, and comprising the most important gaseous source of
atmospheric infrared opacity. Specifically, it functions as the fuel for the
development of convective storm clouds. This parameter, however, is considered
one of the least studied due to the limitations of conventional monitoring
instruments. The current predominate monitoring tools are humidity gauges and
satellites which suffer from a lack of spatial representativeness and
difficulties in measuring at ground level altitudes, respectively. This study
demonstrates for the first time the potential to reconstruct the 2-Dimensional
humidity field using commercial microwave links which form the infrastructure
for data transmission in cellular networks. Water vapor attenuates the waves
transmitted by the system and thus these microwave links can potentially form
as a virtual network for monitoring the humidity field. The results show a
correlation of between 0.6 and 0.92 with root mean square differences ranging
from 1.9 to 4.15 gr/m^3 between conventional humidity gauges and the humidity
estimates calculated for the same points in space by the proposed technology.
The results obtained are the first to point out the improved performance of
humidity measurements when using data from multiple microwave links. These
results indicate the tremendous potential of this novel approach for improving
the initialization of meteorological forecasting models thus potentially
improving the ability to cope with the dangers associated with extreme weather.

pose multiple design and consistency challenges. In this instance, we consider
the case of concurrent sets. A set is a collection of elements, where the
elements are ordered and distinct. These two invariants are always maintained
at every point in time. Currently, multiple implementations of concurrent sets
already exist. LazyList, Hand-over-hand List and Harris List are some of the
well-known implementations. However none of these implementations employ, or
are concerned with garbage collection of deleted nodes. Instead each
implementation ignores deleted nodes or depends on the garbage collector of the
language to handle them. Additionally, Garbage collection in concurrent lists,
that use optimistic traversals or that are lock-free, is not trivial. For
example, in LazyList and Harris List, they allow a thread to traverse a node or
a sequence of nodes after these nodes have already been removed from the list,
and hence possibly deleted. If deleted nodes are to be reused, this will
potentially lead to the ABA problem. Moreover, some languages like C++ do not
have an inbuilt garbage collector. Some constructs like Shared Pointers provide
a limited garbage collection facility, but it degrades performance by a large
scale. Integrating Shared Pointers into a concurrent code is also not a trivial
task. In this paper, we propose a new representation of a concurrent set,
GCList, which employs inbuilt garbage collection. We propose a novel garbage
collection scheme that implements in-built memory reclamation whereby it reuses
deleted nodes from the list. We propose both lock-based and lock-free
implementations of GCList. The garbage collection scheme works in parallel with
the Set operations.

hyperspectral images. Pixel-wise classifiers, such as the classical support
vector machine (SVM), consider spectral information only; therefore they would
generate noisy classification results as spatial information is not utilized.
Many existing methods, such as morphological profiles, superpixel segmentation,
and composite kernels, exploit the spatial information too. In this paper, we
propose a two-stage approach to incorporate the spatial information. In the
first stage, an SVM is used to estimate the class probability for each pixel.
The resulting probability map for each class will be noisy. In the second
stage, a variational denoising method is used to restore these noisy
probability maps to get a good classification map. Our proposed method
effectively utilizes both spectral and spatial information of the hyperspectral
data sets. Experimental results on three widely used real hyperspectral data
sets indicate that our method is very competitive when compared with current
state-of-the-art methods, especially when the inter-class spectra are similar

space can be traversed using various algorithms, such as DFS and A*.
Furthermore, program state is represented in a way that enables scanning a
state space using parallel and distributed algorithms. Executable models
created with this tool can be directly embedded in Java applications, enabling
a model-first approach to system engineering, where initially a model is
created and verified, and then a working application is gradually built around
the model. The model itself consists of a collection of small scripts written
in JavaScript (hence ""BPjs""). Using a variety of case-studies, this paper shows
how the combination of a lenient programming language with formal model
analysis tools creates an efficient way of developing robust complex systems.
Additionally, as we learned from an experimental course we ran, the usage of

proton-proton collision data collected at $\sqrt{s} =$ 13 TeV corresponding to
an integrated luminosity of up to 36 fb$^{-1}$. A low-mass search, for
resonances with masses between 0.6 and 1.6 TeV, is performed based on events
with dijets reconstructed at the trigger level from calorimeter information. A
high-mass search, for resonances with masses above 1.6 TeV, is performed using
dijets reconstructed offline with a particle-flow algorithm. The dijet mass
spectrum is well described by a smooth parameterization and no evidence for the
production of new particles is observed. Upper limits at 95% confidence level
are reported on the production cross section for narrow resonances with masses
above 0.6 TeV. In the context of specific models, the limits exclude string
resonances with masses below 7.7 TeV, scalar diquarks below 7.2 TeV, axigluons
and colorons below 6.1 TeV, excited quarks below 6.0 TeV, color-octet scalars

Randall-Sundrum gravitons below 1.8 TeV and in the range 1.9 to 2.5 TeV, and
dark matter mediators below 2.6 TeV. The limits on both vector and axial-vector
mediators, in a simplified model of interactions between quarks and dark matter
particles, are presented as functions of dark matter particle mass and coupling
to quarks. Searches are also presented for broad resonances, including for the
first time spin-1 resonances with intrinsic widths as large as 30% of the
resonance mass. The broad resonance search improves and extends the exclusions
of a dark matter mediator to larger values of its mass and coupling to quarks.

designing such programs lies in how to balance between large search space of
the network structures and high computational costs. Existing works either
impose strong restrictions on the search space or use enormous computing

that are observed to be helpful: (i) aggressively selecting strongest
individuals for survival and reproduction, and killing weaker individuals at a
very early age; (ii) increasing mutation frequency to encourage diversity and
faster evolution. The combined strategy with additional optimization techniques
allows us to explore a large search space but with affordable computational

evidence to show that the attention mechanism in ATAML has a synergistic effect

including active regions. The magnetic field along which a jet emerges is often
open to interplanetary space, offering a clear ""escape route"" for any
flare-accelerated electrons and making jets lucrative targets for studying
particle acceleration and the solar sources of transient heliospheric events.
Bremsstrahlung hard X-rays (HXRs) could, in principle, trace the accelerated
electrons that escape along the paths of the jets, but measurements of the
escaping electron beams are customarily difficult due to the low densities of
the corona. In this work, we augment HXR observations with gyrosynchrotron
emission observed in microwaves, as well as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission
and modeling to investigate flare-accelerated electrons in a coronal jet. HXR
and microwave data from RHESSI and OVSA, respectively, give complementary
insight into electron spectra and locations, including the presence of
accelerated electrons in the jet itself. High-time-resolution HXR data from the
Konus-Wind instrument suggest electron acceleration timescales on the order of
1 second or shorter. We model the energetic electron distributions in the GX
Simulator framework using SoHO/MDI, RHESSI, TRACE, and OVSA data as
constraints. The result is a modeled distribution, informed and constrained by
measurements, of accelerated electrons as they escape the Sun. Combining the
detection of microwave gyrosynchrotron emission from an open, rather than
closed, magnetic configuration, with realistic 3D modeling constrained by
magnetograms, EUV, and X-ray emission, we obtain the most stringent constraints
to date on the accelerated electrons within a solar jet.

specific heat, a special class of exactly solvable planar layered Ising models
has been studied in the thermodynamic limit. The Ising models consist of
repeated uniform horizontal strips of width $m$ connected by sequences of
vertical strings of length $n$ mutually separated by distance $N$, with $N=1,2$
and $3$. We find that the critical temperature $T_c(N,m,n)$, arising from the
collective effects, decreases as $n$ and $N$ increase, and increases as $m$
increases, as it should be. The amplitude $A(N,m,n)$ of the logarithmic
divergence at the bulk critical temperature $T_c(N,m,n)$ becomes smaller as $n$
and $m$ increase. A rounded peak, with size of order $\ln m$ and signifying the
one-dimensional behavior of strips of finite width $m$, appears when $n$ is
large enough. The appearance of these rounded peaks does not depend on $m$ as
much, but depends rather more on $N$ and $n$, which is rather perplexing.
Moreover, for fixed $m$ and $n$, the specific heats are not much different for
different $N$. This is a most surprising result. For $N=1$, the spin-spin
correlation in the center row of each strip can be written as a Toeplitz
determinant with a generating function which is much more complicated than in
Onsager's Ising model. The spontaneous magnetization in that row can be
calculated numerically and the spin-spin correlation is shown to have
two-dimensional Ising behavior.

optimization which inserts coherent, high-frequency detail from
contextually-similar images of the same physical scene/subject provided from
either a personal image collection or a large online database. The resulting
image is visually plausible and contains coherent high frequency information.
We demonstrate the robustness of our algorithm by testing it on a large number

state-of-the-art approaches, a result that is verified to be statistically

According to the virtual discretization approach, the bilinear form is split as
the sum of a consistency and a stability term. The consistency term is given by
substituting the functions of the virtual space and their gradients with their
polynomial projection in each term of the bilinear form (including the SUPG
stabilization term). Polynomial projections can be computed exactly from the
degrees of freedom. The stability term is also built from the degrees of
freedom by ensuring the correct scalability properties with respect to the mesh
size and the equation coefficients. The nonconforming formulation relaxes the
continuity conditions at cell interfaces and a weaker regularity condition is
considered involving polynomial moments of the solution jumps at cell
interface. Optimal convergence properties of the method are proved in a
suitable norm, which includes a contribution from the advective stabilization
terms. Experimental results confirm the theoretical convergence rates.

decomposition approach hold in the more general setting: reduced complexity and
increased power of computational independence tests. Moreover, latent (hidden)
variables can be represented in MVR CGs by using bidirected edges, and our
algorithm correctly recovers any independence structure that is faithful to an
MVR CG, thus greatly extending the range of applications of decomposition-based

the competitive performance of our method in comparison with the PC-like

However, the resolution of this technique is limited by the Stark effect. As

based on the principle of `causal sufficiency': that it should be possible to
make inferences about interventions using only the probabilities from a single
`reference experiment' plus causal structure in the form of a DAG. This leads
to several interesting results: we find that quantum measurements deserve a
special status distinct from interventions, and that a special rule is needed
for making inferences about what would happen if they are not performed
(`un-measurements'). One natural candidate for this rule is found to be an
equation of importance to the QBist interpretation of quantum mechanics. We
find that the causal structure of quantum systems must have a `layered'
structure, and that the model can naturally be made symmetric under reversal of
the causal arrows.

physiological role in preventing cell death by alleviating high membrane

alone to cell survival after osmotic shock at single cell resolution using
quantitative fluorescence microscopy. We conduct these experiments in an E.

modifications of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. While theoretical models suggest
that only a few MscL channels would be needed to alleviate even large changes

obtain a good initial guess of $X$ as long as the number of Gaussian random
measurements is $O(nr)$, and our iteration algorithm can converge linearly to
the true $X$ (up to an orthogonal matrix) with $m=O\left(nr\log (cr)\right)$

which incrementally described in the form of graph in big data applications.
Most currently, graph processing methods treat the underlying map data as black
boxes. However, as shown in experimental evaluation, graph structures often
have diversity, different graph processing methods are very sensitive to the
graph structure and show different performance for different data sets. Based
on this, a graph processing method for graph structure analysis is proposed in
this paper: (1) This paper calculates the vertex activity of a graph according
to the in-degree and out-degree, and divide the corresponding vertices into the
hot or cold partitions; (2) According to the change of graph structure caused
by partial vertex convergence after iteration, this paper reclassifies the
partitions, divides the lower active vertices into cold partition and reduces
the frequency of calculation, which thereby reducing the cache miss rate and
the I/O overhead caused by active vertices as well; (3) The partition with
highest vertex status degree are given a priority calculation in this paper. In
detail, more pronounced and more frequent vertices have higher processing
priority. In this way, the convergence speed of the graph vertices is
accelerated, and the running time of the graph algorithm in the big data
environment is reduced. Our experiments show that compared with the latest
system, the proposed method can double the performance of different graph
algorithms and data sets.

  Preserving Framework for Recommender Systems",,,,,"cs.IR cs.HC cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most industrial recommender systems rely on the popular collaborative
filtering (CF) technique for providing personalized recommendations to its
users. However, the very nature of CF is adversarial to the idea of user
privacy, because users need to share their preferences with others in order to
be grouped with like-minded people and receive accurate recommendations. While
previous privacy preserving approaches have been successful inasmuch as they
concealed user preference information to some extent from a centralized
recommender system, they have also, nevertheless, incurred significant
trade-offs in terms of privacy, scalability, and accuracy. They are also
vulnerable to privacy breaches by malicious actors. In light of these
observations, we propose a novel selective privacy preserving (SP2) paradigm
that allows users to custom define the scope and extent of their individual
privacies, by marking their personal ratings as either public (which can be
shared) or private (which are never shared and stored only on the user device).
Our SP2 framework works in two steps: (i) First, it builds an initial
recommendation model based on the sum of all public ratings that have been
shared by users and (ii) then, this public model is fine-tuned on each user's
device based on the user private ratings, thus eventually learning a more
accurate model. Furthermore, in this work, we introduce three different
algorithms for implementing an end-to-end SP2 framework that can scale
effectively from thousands to hundreds of millions of items. Our user survey
shows that an overwhelming fraction of users are likely to rate much more items
to improve the overall recommendations when they can control what ratings will
be publicly shared with others.

users' locations. It is therefore important that cooperative spectrum sensing
schemes be empowered with privacy preserving capabilities so as to provide SUs
with incentives for participating in the sensing task. In this paper, we
propose privacy preserving protocols that make use of various cryptographic
mechanisms to preserve the location privacy of SUs while performing reliable
and efficient spectrum sensing. We also present cost-performance tradeoffs. The
first consists on using an additional architectural entity at the benefit of
incurring lower computation overhead by relying only on symmetric cryptography.
The second consists on using an additional secure comparison protocol at the
benefit of incurring lesser architectural cost by not requiring extra entities.
Our schemes can also adapt to the case of a malicious fusion center as we

multi-dimensional, compressible flows can be studied in detail. In particular,
there are flows of this type that exhibit imploding shocks and cavities. In
such flows the primary flow variables (density, velocity, pressure,
temperature) become unbounded at time of collapse. In both cases the solution
can be propagated beyond collapse by having an expanding shock wave reflect off
the center of motion.
  These types of flows are of relevance in bomb-making and inertial confinement
fusion, and also as benchmarks for computational codes; they have been
investigated extensively in the applied literature. However, despite their
obvious theoretical interest as examples of unbounded solutions to the
multi-dimensional Euler system, the existing literature does not address to
what extent such solutions are bona fide weak solutions.
  In this work we review the construction of globally defined radial similarity
shock and cavity flows, and give a detailed description of their behavior
following collapse. We then prove that similarity shock solutions provide
genuine weak solutions, of unbounded amplitude, to the multi-dimensional Euler
system. However, both types of similarity flows involve regions of vanishing
pressure prior to collapse (due to vanishing temperature and vacuum,
respectively) - raising the possibility that Euler flows may remain bounded in
the absence of such regions.

  Recognition","6 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Scene text recognition has attracted a great many researches due to its
importance to various applications. Existing methods mainly adopt recurrence or
convolution based networks. Though have obtained good performance, these
methods still suffer from two limitations: slow training speed due to the
internal recurrence of RNNs, and high complexity due to stacked convolutional
layers for long-term feature extraction. This paper, for the first time,
proposes a no-recurrence sequence-to-sequence text recognizer, named NRTR, that
dispenses with recurrences and convolutions entirely. NRTR follows the
encoder-decoder paradigm, where the encoder uses stacked self-attention to
extract image features, and the decoder applies stacked self-attention to
recognize texts based on encoder output. NRTR relies solely on self-attention
mechanism thus could be trained with more parallelization and less complexity.
Considering scene image has large variation in text and background, we further
design a modality-transform block to effectively transform 2D input images to
1D sequences, combined with the encoder to extract more discriminative
features. NRTR achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance on
both regular and irregular benchmarks, while requires only a small fraction of
training time compared to the best model from the literature (at least 8 times
faster).

  confounding: Estimating health effects of exposure to low levels of ambient
  fine particulate matter",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Clean Air Act mandates that the National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(NAAQS) must be routinely assessed to protect populations based on the latest
science. Therefore, researchers should continue to address whether exposure to
levels of air pollution below the NAAQS is harmful to human health. The
contentious nature surrounding environmental regulations urges us to cast this
question within a causal inference framework. Parametric and semi-parametric
regression approaches have been used to estimate the exposure-response (ER)
curve between ambient air pollution and health outcomes. Most of these
approaches are not formulated within a causal framework, adjust for the same
covariates across all levels of exposure, and do not account for model
uncertainty. We introduce a Bayesian framework for the estimation of a causal
ER curve called LERCA (Local Exposure Response Confounding Adjustment), which
allows for different confounders and different strength of confounding at the
different exposure levels; and propagates uncertainty regarding confounders'
selection and the shape of the ER. LERCA provides a principled way of assessing
the covariates' confounding importance at different exposure levels, providing
researchers with information regarding the variables to adjust for in
regression models. Using simulations, we show that state of the art approaches
perform poorly in estimating the ER curve in the presence of local confounding.
LERCA is used to evaluate the relationship between exposure to ambient PM2.5
and cardiovascular hospitalizations for 5,362 zip codes in the US, while
adjusting for a potentially varying set of confounders across the exposure
range. Ambient PM2.5 leads to an increase in cardiovascular hospitalization
rates when focusing at the low exposure range. Our results indicate that there
is no threshold for the effect of PM2.5 on cardiovascular hospitalizations.

20% uncertainty. The average biases in determining the chemical composition
using archival CCD spectra from $XMM$-$Newton$ and $Suzaku$ range typically
from 15-40%. A simple model in which the enrichment pattern in the Perseus

$\chi^2=10.7$ for 10 d.o.f. However, this pattern is challenging to reproduce

third order extensions of Chern-Simons. Once the gravity is minimally included
into the third order vector field equations, the theory is shown to admit a
two-parameter series of symmetric tensors with on-shell vanishing covariant
divergence. The canonical energy-momentum is included into the series. For a
certain range of the model parameters, the series include the tensors that meet
the weak energy condition, while the canonical energy is unbounded in all the
instances. Because of the on-shell vanishing covariant divergence, any of these
tensors can be considered as an appropriate candidate for the right hand side
of Einstein's equations. If the source differs from the canonical energy
momentum, the coupling is non-Lagrangian while the interaction remains
consistent with any of the tensors. We reformulate these not necessarily
Lagrangian third order equations in the first order formalism which is
covariant in the sense of 1+2 decomposition. After that, we find the Poisson
bracket such that the first order equations are Hamiltonian in all the
instances, be the original third order equations Lagrangian or not. The
brackets differ from canonical ones in the matter sector, while the gravity
admits the usual PB's in terms of ADM variables. The Hamiltonian constraints
generate lapse, shift and gauge transformations of the vector field with
respect to these Poisson brackets. The Hamiltonian constraint, being the lapse
generator, is interpreted as strongly conserved energy. The matter contribution
to the Hamiltonian constraint corresponds to 00-component of the tensor
included as a source in the right hand side of Einstein equations. Once the
00-component of the tensor is bounded, the theory meets the usual sufficient
condition of classical stability, while the original field equations are of
third order.

increasingly popular in optimization. In fact, it is now widely recognized that
the success of deep learning is not only due to the special deep architecture
of the models, but also due to the behavior of the stochastic descent methods
used, which play a key role in reaching ""good"" solutions that generalize well
to unseen data. In an attempt to shed some light on why this is the case, we
revisit some minimax properties of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for the
square loss of linear models---originally developed in the 1990's---and extend
them to general stochastic mirror descent (SMD) algorithms for general loss
functions and nonlinear models. In particular, we show that there is a
fundamental identity which holds for SMD (and SGD) under very general
conditions, and which implies the minimax optimality of SMD (and SGD) for
sufficiently small step size, and for a general class of loss functions and
general nonlinear models. We further show that this identity can be used to
naturally establish other properties of SMD (and SGD), namely convergence and
implicit regularization for over-parameterized linear models (in what is now
being called the ""interpolating regime""), some of which have been shown in
certain cases in prior literature. We also argue how this identity can be used
in the so-called ""highly over-parameterized"" nonlinear setting (where the

into why SMD (and SGD) may have similar convergence and implicit regularization

by principal component analysis (PCA), which in its basic form is not robust to
outliers. Much research has focused on handling rowwise outliers, i.e. rows
that deviate from the majority of the rows in the data (for instance, they
might belong to a different population). In recent years also cellwise outliers
are receiving attention. These are suspicious cells (entries) that can occur
anywhere in the table. Even a relatively small proportion of outlying cells can
contaminate over half the rows, which causes rowwise robust methods to break
down. In this paper a new PCA method is constructed which combines the
strengths of two existing robust methods in order to be robust against both
cellwise and rowwise outliers. At the same time, the algorithm can cope with
missing values. As of yet it is the only PCA method that can deal with all
three problems simultaneously. Its name MacroPCA stands for PCA allowing for
Missingness And Cellwise & Rowwise Outliers. Several simulations and real data
sets illustrate its robustness. New residual maps are introduced, which help to
determine which variables are responsible for the outlying behavior. The method
is well-suited for online process control.

lead to a unitary evolution of system states when satisfying a static discrete

pairs can interact, analyzing first their different representations and showing
there is always a special clock basis for which the evolution for a given
initial state can be described by a constant Hamiltonian $H$. It is also shown,
however, that when the evolution operators form a complete orthogonal set, the
history state is maximally entangled for any initial state, as opposed to the
case of a constant $H$, and can be generated with a simple two-clock setting.
We then examine the quadratic system-time entanglement entropy, providing an
analytic evaluation and showing it satisfies strict upper and lower bounds
determined by the energy spread and the geodesic evolution connecting the
initial and final states. We finally show that the unitary operator that
generates the history state can itself be considered as an operator history
state, whose quadratic entanglement entropy determines its entangling power.
Simple measurements on the clock enable to efficiently determine overlaps
between system states and also evolution operators at any two times.

Successful synthesis of GNRs has triggered efforts to realize field-effect

and reproducible fabrication of single-ribbon FETs is still a challenge that
impedes applications and the understanding of the charge transport. Here, we
present reproducible fabrication of armchair GNR-FETs based on a network of

and, in particular, five-atom-wide GNRs with unprecedented conductivity. We
show formation of reliable Ohmic contacts and a yield of functional FETs close
to unity by lamination of GNRs on the electrodes. Modeling the charge carrier
transport in the networks reveals that this process is governed by inter-ribbon
hopping mediated by nuclear tunneling, with a hopping length comparable to the
physical length of the GNRs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that nuclear tunneling
is a general charge transport characteristic of the GNR networks by using two
different GNRs. Overcoming the challenge of low-yield single-ribbon transistors

in flow. Recent experimental evidence has shown that polymer chains compress in
Couette flow in a manner counter to expectation. Here, scaling arguments
developed previously are used to determine the relationship between the
viscosity and chain radius of gyration. Scaling arguments determine the
viscosity-radius of gyration relationship to be such that the viscosity is
proportional to the radius to the power of 9. The viscosity is shown to be a
power law function of the radius, and to decrease with decreasing radius under
conditions where the chains are ideal random walks in concentrated solution.
Furthermore, this relationship is consistent with both the widely observed
viscosity-temperature and viscosity-shear rate behavior observed in polymer
rheology. The assumption of extension is not consistent with these observations
as it would require that the chains increase in size with increasing
temperature. Shear thinning is thus a result of a decreasing radius with
increasing shear rate as the radius is proportional to the the shear rate
raised to the power law exponent divided by 9. The thermal expansion
coefficient determines the variation in the power law exponents that are
measured for different polymer systems. Typical values on n enable the measured
reduction in coils size behavior to be fitted. Furthermore, the absurd notion
that polymer chains extend to reduce the viscosity implies that an increasing
chain size results in a reduced viscosity is addressed. This assumption would
require that the viscosity increases with reducing coil radius which is simply
unphysical.

stabilizing effects of the stellar magnetic field, we revisit the issue of
whether the inertial modes of a neutron star can become unstable when the
neutron and proton condensates flow with respect to one another. The neutron
and proton condensates are coupled through the motion of imperfectly pinned
vorticity (vortex slippage) and vortex-mediated scattering (mutual friction).
Two-stream instabilities that occur when the two condensates rotate with
respect to one another in the outer core are stabilized by the toroidal
component of the magnetic field. This stabilization occurs when the Alfv\'en
speed of the toroidal component of the magnetic field becomes larger than the
relative rotational velocity of the condensates, corresponding to toroidal
field strengths in excess of $\simeq 10^{10}\,{\rm G}$. In contrast with
previous studies, we find that spin down of a neutron star under a steady
torque is stable. The Donnelly--Glaberson instability is not stabilized by the
magnetic field, and could play an important role if neutron stars undergo
precession.

depends only on the geometry of $M$ and $\omega$. Luc Miller (JDE, 2004)
conjectured that $K$ is (universally) proportional to the square of the maximal
distance from $\omega$ to a point of $M$. We show in particular geometries that
$K$ may blow up like $|\log(r)|^2$ when $\omega$ is a ball of radius $r$, hence
disproving the conjecture. We then prove in the general case the associated
upper bound on this blowup. We also show that the conjecture is true for
positive solutions of the heat equation.
  The proofs rely on the study of the maximal vanishing rate of (sums of)
eigenfunctions. They also yield lower and upper bounds for other geometric
constants appearing as tunneling constants or approximate control costs.
  As an intermediate step in the proofs, we provide a uniform Carleman estimate

In attractor network models of grid formation, the grid scale of a single

that the MEC forms a hierarchy of discrete modules if a smooth increase in
inhibition distance along its dorso-ventral axis is accompanied by excitatory

grids and have values that fall within the observed range. We discuss how

determine which base station a user connects to in order to balance base
station loads and maximize throughput. Given that mmWave connections are highly
directional and vulnerable to small channel variations, user association
changes these connections and hence significantly affects the user's
instantaneous rate as well as network interference. In this paper, we introduce
a new load balancing user association scheme for mmWave MIMO networks which
considers this dependency on user association of user's transmission rates and
network interference. We formulate the user association problem as mixed
integer nonlinear programming and design a polynomial-time algorithm, called
Worst Connection Swapping (WCS), to find a near-optimal solution. Simulation
results confirm that the proposed user association scheme improves network
performance significantly by moving the traffic of congested base stations to
lightly-loaded ones and adjusting the interference accordingly. Further, the
proposed WCS algorithm outperforms other generic algorithms for combinatorial
programming such as the genetic algorithm in both accuracy and speed at several
orders of magnitude faster, and for small networks where exhaustive search is
possible it reaches the optimal solution.

(CSTF) exhibits the circular Bragg phenomenon and can therefore be used as a
circular- polarization filter in a spectral regime called the circular Bragg
regime. This has been already demonstrated in the near-infrared and
short-wavelength infrared regimes. If two CSTFs are fabricated in identical
conditions to differ only in the helical pitch, and if both are made of a
material whose bulk refractive index is constant in a wide enough spectral
regime, then the center wavelengths of the circular Bragg regimes of the two
CSTFs must be in the same ratio as their helical pitches by virtue of the scale
invariance of the frequency-domain Maxwell postulates. This theoretical result
was confirmed by measuring the linear-transmittance spectrums of two
zinc-selenide CSTFs with helical pitches in the ratio 1:7:97. The center
wavelengths were found to be in the ratio 1:7:1, the deviation from the ratio
of helical pitches being explainable at least in part be- cause the bulk
refractive index of zinc selenide decreased a little with wavelength. We
concluded that CSTFs can be fabricated to function as circular-polarization

line at 63.2 micron with high angular (6"") and spectral resolution, using GREAT
on board SOFIA. The OI emission distribution is compared to the CO 16-15, CII
158 micron, and CO 11-10 lines, mm-molecular lines, and continuum. It is
composed of several velocity components in the range from -30 km/s to 25 km/s.
The high-velocity blue- and redshifted emission can be explained as arising
from accelerated photodissociated (PDR) gas associated with a dark lane close
to the massive binary system S106 IR, and from shocks caused by the stellar
wind and/or a disk--envelope interaction. At velocities from -9 to -4 km/s and
0.5 to 8 km/s line wings are observed that we attribute to cooling in PDRs
created by the ionizing radiation impinging on the cavity walls. The bulk
velocity range is dominated by PDR emission from the clumpy molecular cloud.
Modelling the emission in the different velocity ranges with the KOSMA-tau code
constrains a radiation field chi of a few times 10^4 and densities n of a few
times 10^4 cm^-3. Considering self-absorption of the OI line results in higher
densities (up to 10^6 cm^-3) only for the gas component seen at high blue- and
red velocities. The dark lane has a mass of 275 Msun and shows a velocity
difference of 1.4 km/s along its projected length of 1 pc, determined from
H13CO+ 1-0 mapping. It can be interpreted as a massive accretion flow, or the
remains of it, linked to S106 IR/FIR. The most likely explanation is that the
binary system is at a stage of its evolution where gas accretion is
counteracted by the stellar winds and radiation, leading to the very complex
observed spatial and kinematic emission distribution of the various tracers.

But what does one obtain if one considers $all\ possible$ morsifications and

This work proposes a novel adaptive SI cancellation algorithm in the digital

techniques. Inspired by recent progress in acoustic echo control, we introduce
a composite state-space model of the nonlinear SI channel in cascade structure.
We derive a SI cancellation algorithm that decouples the identification of
linear and nonlinear elements of the composite state. They are estimated
separately and consecutively in each adaptation cycle by a Kalman filter in DFT
domain. We show that this adaptation can be supported by a-priori signal
orthogonalization and decoding of the signal-of-interest (SoI). In our
simulation results, we analyze the performance by evaluating residual
interference, system identification accuracy and communication rate. Based on
the results, we provide recommendations for system design. In case of input
orthogonalization, our Kalman filter solution in cascade structure delivers
best performance with low computational complexity. In this configuration, the
performance lines up with that of the monolithic (parallel) Kalman filter or
the recursive-least squares (RLS) algorithms. We show that the Kalman-based
algorithm is superior over the RLS under time-variant conditions if the SoI is
decoded and in this way the covariance information required by the Kalman

utilized for such analyses. The same modeling framework may also be used to not
only derive a combined estimate, but also to borrow strength for a particular
study from another by deriving a shrinkage estimate. For instance, a
small-scale randomized controlled trial could be supported by a non-randomized
study, e.g. a clinical registry. This would be particularly attractive in the
context of rare diseases. We demonstrate that a meta-analysis still makes sense
in this extreme two-study setup, as illustrated using a recent trial and a
clinical registry in Creutzfeld-Jakob disease. Derivation of a shrinkage

improve a given estimate even based on only a single additional estimate while
accounting for potential effect heterogeneity between the studies.
Alternatively, inference may equivalently be motivated via a model
specification that does not require a common overall mean parameter but
considers the treatment effect in one study, and the difference in effects
between the studies. The proposed approach is quite generally applicable to
combine different types of evidence originating e.g. from meta-analyses or
individual studies. An application of this more general setup is provided in

networks. It is built upon a sparse, random and large hidden infrastructure
called reservoir. ESNs have succeeded in dealing with several non-linear
problems such as prediction, classification, etc. Thanks to its rich dynamics,
ESN is used as an Autoencoder (AE) to extract features from original data
representations. ESN is not only used with its basic single layer form but also
with the recently proposed Multi-Layer (ML) architecture. The well setting of
ESN (basic and ML) architectures and training parameters is a crucial and hard
labor task. Generally, a number of parameters (hidden neurons, sparsity rates,
input scaling) is manually altered to achieve minimum learning error. However,
this randomly hand crafted task, on one hand, may not guarantee best training
results and on the other hand, it can raise the network's complexity. In this
paper, a hierarchical bi-level evolutionary optimization is proposed to deal
with these issues. The first level includes a multi-objective architecture
optimization providing maximum learning accuracy while sustaining the
complexity at a reduced standard. Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization
(MOPSO) is used to optimize ESN structure in a way to provide a trade-off
between the network complexity decreasing and the accuracy increasing. A
pareto-front of optimal solutions is generated by the end of the MOPSO process.
These solutions present the set of candidates that succeeded in providing a
compromise between different objectives (learning error and network
complexity). At the second level, each of the solutions already found undergo a
mono-objective weights optimization to enhance the obtained pareto-front.
Empirical results ensure the effectiveness of the evolved ESN recurrent AEs
(basic and ML) for noisy and noise free data.

revealing two possible ways to generate the temporal solitons. One way includes
the dynamics of raised relaxation oscillation, quasi mode-locking stage,
spectral beating behavior, and finally the stable single-soliton mode-locking.
The other way contains, however, an extra transient bound-state stage before
the final single-pulse mode-locking operation.

prove that Schneiders' pyramid has no hexahedral meshes with fewer than 18
interior vertices and 17 hexahedra, and introduce a valid mesh with 44

with 40 hexahedra and 42 interior vertices. These results were obtained through
a general purpose algorithm that computes the hexahedral meshes conformal to a
given quadrilateral surface boundary. The lower bound for Schneiders' pyramid
is obtained by exhaustively listing the hexahedral meshes with up to 17
interior vertices and which have the same boundary as the pyramid. Our
44-element mesh is obtained by modifying a prior solution with 88 hexahedra.
The number of elements was reduced using an algorithm which locally simplifies
groups of hexahedra. Given the boundary of such a group, our algorithm is used
to find a mesh of its interior that has fewer elements than the initial
subdivision. The resulting mesh is untangled to obtain a valid hexahedral mesh.

as well as an improved version including perturbative triple excitations
(ECCSD(T)). These theories incorporate electron-electron correlation into the
effective paradigm and through their computational implementation, a diverse
set of small muonic species is considered as a benchmark at these post-EHF
levels. A comparative computational study on this set demonstrates that the
muonic bond length is in general non-negligibly longer than corresponding
hydrogenic analogs. Next, the developed post-EHF theories are applied for the
muoniated N-Heterocyclic carbene/silylene/germylene and the muoniated
triazolium cation revealing the relative stability of the sticking sites of the
muon in each species. The computational results, in line with previously

attach to the divalent atom with carbeneic nature. A detailed comparison of

radiation from a population of compact, actively star-forming galaxies at
redshift z~0.3, also known as ""green peas"". We here study the peculiar green
pea Lyman-alpha (Lya) spectra, which are mostly double-peaked, unlike in any
other galaxy sample. We select a sample of twelve archival green peas and we
apply numerical radiative transfer models to reproduce the observed Lya
spectral profiles, using the geometry of expanding, homogeneous spherical
shells. We use ancillary optical and ultraviolet data to constrain the model
parameters, and we evaluate the match between the models and the observed Lya
spectra. As a second step, we allow all the fitting parameters to be free, and
examine the agreement between the interstellar medium parameters derived from
the models and those from ancillary data. The green pea double-peaked Lya line
profiles are not correctly reproduced by the constrained shell models.
Conversely, unconstrained models fit the spectra, but parameters derived from
the best-fitting models are not in agreement with the ancillary data. In
particular: 1) the best-fit systemic redshifts are larger by 10 - 250 km/s than
those derived from optical emission lines, 2) the double-peaked Lya profiles
are best reproduced with low-velocity (<150 km/s) outflows that contradict the
observed ultraviolet absorption lines of low-ionization-state elements with
characteristic velocities as large as 300 km/s, and 3) the models need to
consider intrinsic Lya profiles that are on average three times broader than
the observed Balmer lines. Differences between the modelled and observed
velocities are larger for targets with prominent Lya blue peaks. The blue peak
position and flux appear to be connected to low column densities of neutral
hydrogen, leading to Lya and Lyman-continuum escape.

the intrinsic anisotropy of BP, which exhibits few dependence on the incident

in response rate across system components remains unconsidered. Here I vary the
component response rates ($\boldsymbol{\gamma}$) of randomly generated complex
systems. I use numerical simulations to show that when component response rates
vary, the potential for system stability increases. These results are robust to
common network structures, including small-world and scale-free networks, and
cascade food webs. Variation in $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ is especially important
for stability in highly complex systems, in which the probability of stability
would otherwise be negligible. At such extremes of simulated system complexity,
the largest stable complex systems would be unstable if not for variation in

with previous calculations including radiative feedback, we find that the
dependence of the characteristic stellar mass, $M_{\rm c}$, on the initial mean

Jeans mass. However, unlike previous calculations, which found no statistically
significant variation in the median mass with density, we find a weak
dependence approximately of the form $M_{\rm c} \propto \rho^{-1/5}$. The
distributions of properties of multiple systems do not vary significantly
between the calculations. We compare our results to the result of observational

work we study the performances of our optical potential in comparison with
those of a successful nonrelativistic phenomenological optical potential in the

energies around and above 200 MeV.
  We use the same framework and the same approximations of our previous papers,
where the nonrelativistic optical potential is derived at the first-order term
within the spectator expansion of the multiple scattering theory and adopting
the impulse approximation and the optimum factorization approximation.
  The cross sections and analyzing powers for elastic proton scattering off

applications, ranging from catalysts in solid oxide fuel cells to light
absorbing layers in solar photovoltaics. The thermodynamic phase stability is a
key parameter that broadly governs whether the material is expected to be
synthesizable, and whether it may degrade under certain operating conditions.
Phase stability can be calculated using Density Functional Theory (DFT), but
the significant computational cost makes such calculation potentially
prohibitive when screening large numbers of possible compounds. In this work,
we developed machine learning models to predict the thermodynamic phase
stability of perovskite oxides using a dataset of more than 1900 DFT-calculated
perovskite oxide energies. The phase stability was determined using convex hull
analysis, with the energy above the convex hull (Ehull) providing a direct
measure of the stability. We generated a set of 791 features based on elemental
property data to correlate with the Ehull value of each perovskite compound.
For classification, the extra trees algorithm achieved the best prediction
accuracy of 0.93 (+/- 0.02), with an F1 score of 0.88 (+/- 0.03). For
regression, leave-out 20% cross-validation tests with kernel ridge regression
achieved the minimal root mean square error (RMSE) of 28.5 (+/- 7.5) meV/atom
between cross-validation predicted Ehull values and DFT calculations, with the
mean absolute error (MAE) in cross-validation energies of 16.7 (+/- 2.3)
meV/atom. We further validated our model by predicting the stability of
compounds not present in the training set and demonstrated our machine learning
models are a fast and effective means of obtaining qualitatively useful
guidance for a wide-range of perovskite oxide stability, potentially impacting
materials design choices in a variety of technological applications.

great variability in frequency and time. We present spatially resolved spectral
radio observations of type IIIb bursts in the $30-80$ MHz range made by the Low
Frequency Array (LOFAR). The bursts show well-defined fine frequency
structuring called ""stria"" bursts. The spatial characteristics of the stria
sources are determined by the propagation effects of radio waves; their
movement and expansion speeds are in the range of 0.1-0.6c. Analysis of the
dynamic spectra reveals that both the spectral bandwidth and the frequency
drift rate of the striae increase with an increase of their central frequency;
the striae bandwidths are in the range of ~20-100 kHz and the striae drift
rates vary from zero to ~0.3 MHz s^-1. The observed spectral characteristics of
the stria bursts are consistent with the model involving modulation of the type
III burst emission mechanism by small-amplitude fluctuations of the plasma
density along the electron beam path. We estimate that the relative amplitude
of the density fluctuations is of dn/n~10^-3, their characteristic length scale
is less than 1000 km, and the characteristic propagation speed is in the range
of 400-800 km/s. These parameters indicate that the observed fine spectral
structures could be produced by propagating magnetohydrodynamic waves.

Normative modeling is based on single-output Gaussian process regression that

Gaussian process regression (S-MTGPR) approach to address this problem. To this
end, we exploit a combination of a low-rank approximation of the spatial
covariance matrix with algebraic properties of Kronecker product in order to
reduce the computational complexity of Gaussian process regression in
high-dimensional output spaces. On a public fMRI dataset, we show that S-MTGPR:
1) leads to substantial computational improvements that allow us to estimate
normative models for high-dimensional fMRI data whilst accounting for spatial
structure in data; 2) by modeling both spatial and across-sample variances, it
provides higher sensitivity in novelty detection scenarios.

fundamental test ground for understanding biological motility. However, until
now, multi-filament collisions,depletion agents or binding molecules has been
required for the emergence of ordered patterns in motility assay. Thus, whether
simple physical interactions during collisions such as steric effect without
depletion nor binding agents are sufficient or not for producing ordered
patterns in motility assays remains still elusive. In this article, we
constructed a motility assay purely consists of kinesin motor and microtubule
in which the frequency of binary collision can be controlled without using
depletion nor binding agents. By controlling strength of steric interaction and
density of microtubules, we found different states; disordered state,
long-range orientationally ordered state, liquid-gas-like phase separated
state, and transitions between them. We found that a balance between cross over
and aligning events in collisions controls transition from disorder to global
ordered state, while excessively strong steric effect leads to the phase
separated clusters. Furthermore, macroscopic chiral symmetry breaking observed
as a global rotation of nematic order observed in this experiment could be
attributed to the chirality at molecular level. Numerical simulations in which
we change strength of volume exclusion reproduce these experimental results.
Moreover, it reveals the transition from long-range alignment to nematic bands
then to aggregations. This study may provide new insights into dynamic ordering

seismicity in recent years, providing new datasets of earthquake recordings to
develop ground motion prediction models for this particular region of the
Central and Eastern North America (CENA). This paper outlines a framework for
using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to develop attenuation models from the
ground motion recordings in this region. While attenuation models exist for the
CENA, concerns over the increased rate of seismicity in this region necessitate
investigation of ground motions prediction models particular to these states.
To do so, an ANN-based framework is proposed to predict peak ground
acceleration (PGA) and peak ground velocity (PGV) given magnitude, earthquake
source-to-site distance, and shear wave velocity. In this framework,
approximately 4,500 ground motions with magnitude greater than 3.0 recorded in
these three states (Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas) since 2005 are considered.
Results from this study suggest that existing ground motion prediction models
developed for CENA do not accurately predict the ground motion intensity
measures for earthquakes in this region, especially for those with low
source-to-site distances or on very soft soil conditions. The proposed ANN
models provide much more accurate prediction of the ground motion intensity
measures at all distances and magnitudes. The proposed ANN models are also
converted to relatively simple mathematical equations so that engineers can
easily use them to predict the ground motion intensity measures for future
events. Finally, through a sensitivity analysis, the contributions of the
predictive parameters to the prediction of the considered intensity measures
are investigated.

Recently our ability to study stars using asteroseismic techniques
has increased dramatically, largely through the use of space based photometric
observations. Work has also been done using ground based spectroscopic
observations and more is expected in the near future from the SONG network.
Unfortunately, the intensity observations have an inferior signal to noise
ratio and details of the observations do not agree with theory, while the data
analysis used in the spectroscopic method has often been based on overly simple
models of the spectra. Aims. The aim is to improve the reliability of
measurements of the parameters of stellar oscillations using spectroscopic
observations and to enable the optimal use of the observations. Methods. While
previous investigations have used 1D models, I use realistic
magnetohydrodynamic simulations, combined with radiative transfer calculations,
to estimate the effects of the oscillations on the spectra. I then calculate
the visibility of the oscillation modes for a variety of stellar parameters and
using various fitting methods. In addition to the methods used in previous
investigations, I use a Singular Value Decomposition technique, which allows
one to determine the information content available from the spectral
perturbations and how that can be expressed most compactly. Finally I describe
how the time series obtained may be analyzed. Results. It is shown that it is
important to model the visibilities carefully and that the results deviate
substantially from models previously used, especially in the presence of
rotation. Detailed spectral modeling may be exploited to measure the properties
of a larger number of modes than possible using the commonly used
cross-correlation method. With moderate rotation, there is as much information
in the line shape changes as in the Doppler shift and an outline of how to
extract this is given.

ground by a drone. SS is challenging due to its combinatorial explosion nature,
because the number of possible combination of sensor positions increases
exponentially with the increase in the number of sensors. In this paper, we
propose an online planning method called SubModular Optimization Sensor
Scattering (SuMo-SS). Unlike existing methods, the proposed method can deal
with uncertainty in sensor positions. It does not suffer from combinatorial
explosion but obtains a (1-1/e)-approximation of the optimal solution. We built
a physical drone that can scatter sensors in an indoor environment as well as a
simulation environment based on the drone and the environment. In this paper,
we present the theoretical background of our proposed method and its
experimental validation.

phase imaging technique, which enables the reconstruction of the 3D refractive
index (RI) distribution of a transparent sample. Due to its fast, non-invasive,
and quantitative 3D imaging capability, ODT has emerged as one of the most
powerful tools for various applications. However, the spatial resolution of ODT
has only been quantified along the lateral and axial directions for limited
conditions; it has not been investigated for arbitrary-oblique directions. In
this paper, we systematically quantify the 3D spatial resolution of ODT by
exploiting the spatial bandwidth of the reconstructed scattering potential. The
3D spatial resolution is calculated for various types of ODT systems, including
the illumination-scanning, sample-rotation, and hybrid scanning-rotation
methods. In particular, using the calculated 3D spatial resolution, we provide
the spatial resolution as well as the arbitrary sliced angle. Furthermore, to
validate the present method, the point spread function of an ODT system is
experimentally obtained using the deconvolution of a 3D RI distribution of a
microsphere and is compared with the calculated resolution. The present method
for defining spatial resolution in ODT is directly applicable for various 3D
microscopic techniques, providing a solid criterion for the accessible finest
3D structures.

time-varying treatment in the presence of time-dependent confounding via
weighted regression. The standard approach of using inverse probability of
treatment weighting (IPTW) can lead to high-variance estimates due to extreme
weights and be sensitive to model misspecification. Various methods have been
proposed to partially address this, including truncation and stabilized-IPTW to
temper extreme weights and covariate balancing propensity score (CBPS) to
address treatment model misspecification. In this paper, we present Kernel
Optimal Weighting (KOW), a convex-optimization-based approach that finds
weights for fitting the MSM that optimally balance time-dependent confounders
while simultaneously controlling for precision, directly addressing the above
limitations. KOW directly minimizes the error in estimation due to
time-dependent confounding via a new decomposition as a functional. We further
extend KOW to control for informative censoring. We evaluate the performance of
KOW in a simulation study, comparing it with IPTW, stabilized-IPTW, and CBPS.
We demonstrate the use of KOW in studying the effect of treatment initiation on

harmonic traps. Sets of available \textit{ab initio} results are used as
benchmark pseudo-data for adjusting the additional parameters (with respect to
the nuclear matter case) that have to be introduced for finite-size systems.
Several quantities are predicted and compared to \textit{ab initio} and other
EDF results such as, for instance, total energies, potentials, and density
profiles. The associated effective masses are also analyzed. In cases where
\textit{ab initio} results are available, two of these functionals globally
provide predictions which are close one to the other as well as to \textit{ab

currently used Skyrme functionals. Directions for improving the third

constructions of Brown and Bloch-Esnault-Kreimer. A fundamental role is played
by the Newton polytope of the product of the Symanzik polynomials, which we
show to be a generalized permutahedron for generic kinematics. As an
application, we review two approaches to dimensional regularization of Feynman

variations among astrophysical sources, depending both on the type of target
and on the molecular tracer used. These variations cannot be reproduced by the
current chemical models.
  Aims: Until now, the $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio in N$_2$H$^+$ has been
accurately measured in only one prestellar source, L1544, where strong levels
of fractionation, with depletion in $^{15}$N, are found ($^{14}$N/$^{15}$N$\:
\approx 1000$). In this paper we extend the sample to three more bona fide
prestellar cores, in order to understand if the antifractionation in N$_2$H$^+$
is a common feature of this kind of sources.
  Methods: We observed N$_2$H$^+$,N$^{15}$NH$^+$ and $^{15}$NNH$^+$ in L183,
L429 and L694-2 with the IRAM 30m telescope. We modeled the emission with a
non-local radiative transfer code in order to obtain accurate estimates of the
molecular column densities, including the one for the optically thick
N$_2$H$^+$. We used the most recent collisional rate coefficients available,
and with these we also re-analysed the L1544 spectra previously published.
  Results: The obtained isotopic ratios are in the range $630-770$ and
significantly differ with the value, predicted by the most recent chemical
models, of $\approx 440$, close to the protosolar value. Our prestellar core
sample shows high level of depletion of $^{15}$N in diazenylium, as previously
found in L1544. A revision of the N chemical networks is needed in order to
explain these results.

This entropy arises due to decoherence of eigenstates with different energies
during the time evolution after the collisions with the target. We define it
rigorously as the entanglement entropy of the produced system with the
experimental apparatus. We compute the time dependent single event entropy in
the limit of weak projectile field. Further we compute the entropy for the
ensemble of events defined by the McLerran-Venugopalan model for the projectile
wave function. Interestingly the entropy of the ensemble has a much weaker time
dependence than the entropy in any single event. We attribute this feature to
the so called monogamy of entanglement.

time - and analyze its features for each correlation source. We find that the
coherence time behaves very different for the different interference scenarios

Galactic Center. With respect to the Bremsstrahlung X-ray emission of the hot
plasma in that region the Galactic Center casts a 'shadow'. The 'shadow' is
caused by the Circum Nuclear Disk that surrounds SgrA* at a distance of about 1
to 2 parsec. This detection allows us to do a detailed investigation of the
physical properties of the surroundings of the super massive black hole.
Further in, the cluster of high velocity stars orbiting the central super
massive black hole SgrA* represents an ideal probe for the gravitational
potential and the degree of relativity that one can attribute to this area.
Recently, three of the closest stars (S2, S38, and S55/S0-102) have been used
to conduct these investigations. In addition to the black hole mass and
distance a relativistic parameter defined as ${\Upsilon}=r_s/r_p$ could be
derived for star S2. The quantity $r_s$ is the Schwarzschild radius and $r_p$
is the pericenter distance of the orbiting star. Here, in this publication, we
highlight the robustness and significance of this result. If one aims at
investigating stronger relativistic effects one needs to get closer to SgrA*.
Here, one can use the emission of plasma blobs that orbit SgrA*. This
information can be obtained by modeling lightcurves of bright X-ray flares.
Finally, we comment on the shadow of the SgrA* black hole expected due to light
bending and boosting in its vicinity.

chemical modelling we expect a strong radial variation for the abundances of
these species, which mostly are emitted in the external layer where non thermal
desorption of other species has previously been observed. We show that the

conclude that a strong sulphur depletion is necessary to fully reproduce our

supposedly makes M-branes exhibit the nonabelian gauge degrees of freedom that
are seen perturbatively in the limit of 10d string theory. In fact, since only
the twisted K-theory classes represented by nonabelian Chan-Paton gauge fields
on D-branes have invariant meaning, the problem is really the lift to M-theory
of the twisted K-theory classification of D-brane charges. Here we show how
this problem has a solution by universal constructions in super homotopy
theory, at least rationally. We recall how double dimensional reduction of
super M-brane charges is described by the cyclification adjunction applied to
the 4-sphere, and how M-theory degrees of freedom hidden at ADE-singularities
are induced by the suspended Hopf action on the 4-sphere. Combining these, we
demonstrate, at the level of rational homotopy theory, that gauge enhancement
in M-theory is exhibited by lifting against the fiberwise stabilization of the
unit of this cyclification adjunction on the A-type orbispace of the 4-sphere.
This explains how the fundamental D6 and D8 brane cocycles can be lifted from
twisted K-theory to a cohomology theory for M-brane charge, at least
rationally.

theory. Several alternative formulations of cohesive subgraph have been
proposed, a notable example being $s$-club, which is a subgraph where each
vertex is at distance at most $s$ to the others. Here we consider the problem
of covering a given graph with the minimum number of $s$-clubs. We study the
computational and approximation complexity of this problem, when $s$ is equal
to 2 or 3. First, we show that deciding if there exists a cover of a graph with
three $2$-clubs is NP-complete, and that deciding if there exists a cover of a
graph with two $3$-clubs is NP-complete. Then, we consider the approximation
complexity of covering a graph with the minimum number of $2$-clubs and
$3$-clubs. We show that, given a graph $G=(V,E)$ to be covered, covering $G$
with the minimum number of $2$-clubs is not approximable within factor
$O(|V|^{1/2 -\varepsilon})$, for any $\varepsilon>0$, and covering $G$ with the
minimum number of $3$-clubs is not approximable within factor $O(|V|^{1

scores on certain rating scales which are then aggregated into Mean Opinion
Scores (MOS). From the observed sample data, the expected value is to be
estimated. While the sample average only provides a point estimator, confidence
intervals (CI) are an interval estimate which contains the desired expected
value with a given confidence level. In subjective studies, the number of
subjects performing the test is typically small, especially in lab
environments. The used rating scales are bounded and often discrete like the
5-point ACR rating scale. Therefore, we review statistical approaches in the
literature for their applicability in the QoE domain for MOS interval
estimation (instead of having only a point estimator, which is the MOS). We
provide a conservative estimator based on the SOS hypothesis and binomial
distributions and compare its performance (CI width, outlier ratio of CI
violating the rating scale bounds) and coverage probability with well known CI
estimators. We show that the provided CI estimator works very well in practice
for MOS interval estimators, while the commonly used studentized CIs suffer
from a positive outlier ratio, i.e., CIs beyond the bounds of the rating scale.
As an alternative, bootstrapping, i.e., random sampling of the subjective
ratings with replacement, is an efficient CI estimator leading to typically
smaller CIs, but lower coverage than the proposed estimator.

a complete (or sufficiently quickly expanding) topology as underlying migration
graph most efficient for optimization, even though a quick dissemination of
individuals leads to a loss of diversity. We suggest a simple fitness function
FORK with two local optima parametrized by $r \geq 2$ and a scheme for
composite fitness functions. We show that, while the (1+1) EA gets stuck in a
bad local optimum and incurs a run time of $\Theta(n^{2r})$ fitness evaluations
on FORK, island models with a complete topology can achieve a run time of
$\Theta(n^{1.5r})$ by making use of rare migrations in order to explore the
search space more effectively. Finally, the ring topology, making use of rare
migrations and a large diameter, can achieve a run time of
$\tilde{\Theta}(n^r)$, the black box complexity of FORK. This shows that the
ring topology can be preferable over the complete topology in order to maintain
diversity.

neutrino mass generation, a possible unification to $SU(7)$, along with
spontaneous symmetry breaking of $SU(2)_N$ resulting in massive gauge bosons.
None of the SM particles are charged under $SU(2)_N$ and therefore $X,\bar{X}$

including non-zero DM-DM interactions, to comply with relic density and direct

of embedded systems as an answer to the rampant increase in complexity.
  While mature desktop and server solutions exist, they cannot be easily reused
on embedded systems because of markedly different requirements. Unfortunately,
optimizations aimed at throughput, important for servers, often compromise on
aspects like predictable real-time behavior, which are crucial to many embedded
systems. In a similar vein, the requirements for small trusted computing bases,
lightweight inter-VM communication, and small footprints are often not
accommodated. This observation suggests that virtual machines for embedded

the specific requirements.

security-conscious workloads and describe the steps necessary to achieve good
event-handling latencies. That evolution is possible because the underlying
microkernel is well suited to satisfy real-time requirements. As the guest
system we chose Linux with the PREEMPT_RT configuration, which itself was

tropospheric methane has been relatively stable and that the polar region has
been brightening over time as a result of increased aerosol scattering. This
interpretation is confirmed by near-IR imaging from HST and from the Keck
telescope using NIRC2 adaptive optics imaging. Our analysis of the 2015
spectra, as well as prior spectra from 2012, shows that there is a factor of
three decrease in the effective upper tropospheric methane mixing ratio between
30\deg N and 70\deg N. The absolute value of the deep methane mixing ratio,
which probably does not vary with latitude, is lower than our previous
estimate, and depends significantly on the style of aerosol model that we
assume, ranging from a high of 3.5$\pm$0.5% for conservative non-spherical
particles with a simple Henyey-Greenstein phase function to a low of
2.7%$\pm$0.3% for conservative spherical particles. Our previous higher
estimate of 4$\pm$0.5% was a result of a forced consistency with occultation
results of Lindal et al. (1987, JGR 92, 14987-15001). That requirement was
abandoned in our new analysis because new work by Orton et al. (2014, Icarus

fields. The non-Gaussian deflections are produced by ray-tracing through

environment, on the Oscillator Death (OD) states of a group of Stuart-Landau
oscillators. The group of oscillators yield a completely symmetric OD state
when uncoupled to the external system, i.e. the two OD states occur with equal
probability. However, remarkably, when coupled to a common external system this
symmetry is significantly broken. For exponentially decaying external systems,
the symmetry breaking is very pronounced for low environmental damping and
strong oscillator-environment coupling. This is evident through the sharp
transition from the symmetric to asymmetric state occurring at a critical
oscillator-environment coupling strength and environmental damping rate.
Further, we consider time-varying connections to the common external
environment, with a fraction of oscillator-environment links switching on and
off. Interestingly, we find that the asymmetry induced by environmental
coupling decreases as a power law with increase in fraction of such on-off
connections. The suggests that blinking oscillator-environment links can
restore the symmetry of the OD state. Lastly, we demonstrate the generality of
our results for a constant external drive, and find marked breaking of symmetry
in the OD states there as well. When the constant environmental drive is large,
the asymmetry in the OD states is very large, and the transition between the
symmetric and asymmetric state with increasing oscillator-environment coupling
is very sharp. So our results demonstrate an environmental coupling-induced
mechanism for the prevalence of certain OD states in a system of oscillators,
and suggests an underlying process for obtaining certain states preferentially
in ensembles of oscillators with environment-mediated coupling.

techniques to investigate the complex dynamics of neuronal networks. An ongoing
challenge is to achieve minimally-invasive and high-resolution observations of
neuronal activity in vivo inside deep brain areas. A perspective strategy is to
utilise holographic control of light propagation in complex media, which allows
converting a hair-thin multimode optical fibre into an ultra-narrow imaging
tool. Compared to current endoscopes based on GRIN lenses or fibre bundles,
this concept offers a footprint reduction exceeding an order of magnitude,
together with a significant enhancement in resolution. We designed a compact
and high-speed system for fluorescent imaging at the tip of a fibre, achieving
micron-scale resolution across a 50 um field of view, and yielding 7-kilopixel
images at a rate of 3.5 frames/s. Furthermore, we demonstrate in vivo
observations of cell bodies and processes of inhibitory neurons within deep
layers of the visual cortex and hippocampus of anesthetised mice. This study
forms the basis for several perspective techniques of modern microscopy to be
delivered deep inside the tissue of living animal models while causing minimal
impact on its structural and functional properties.

compact exotic hadrons which can be approximated as the diquark-anti-diquark
correlations. In the flavor SU(3) symmetry, they form an SU(3) triplet or
anti-sextet. The spectra of the stable doubly heavy tetraquark states are
predicted by Sakharov-Zeldovich formula. We find that the
$T^+_{cc\bar{u}\bar{d}}({\bf 3})$ is about 16MeV below the $DD^*$ threshold,
while $T^{-}_{bb\bar{u}\bar{d}}({\bf 3})$ is about 73MeV below the $BB^*$
threshold. We then study the semileptonic and nonleptonic weak decays of the
stable doubly heavy tetraquark states. The decay amplitudes are parametrized in
terms of SU(3)-irreducible amplitudes. Ratios between decay widths of different
channels are also derived. At the end, we collect the Cabibbo allowed two-body

stable doubly heavy tetraquark states at LHCb and Belle II experiments.

propagate within a wireless environment. Free space path loss, signal
absorption, as well as reflections, refractions and diffractions caused by
physical objects within the environment highly affect the performance of
wireless communications. Currently, such effects are intractable to account for

different approach, enabling deterministic, programmable control over the
behavior of the wireless environments. The key-enabler is the so-called
HyperSurface tile, a novel class of planar meta-materials which can interact
with impinging electromagnetic waves in a controlled manner. The HyperSurface
tiles can effectively re-engineer electromagnetic waves, including steering
towards any desired direction, full absorption, polarization manipulation and
more. Multiple tiles are employed to coat objects such as walls, furniture,
overall, any objects in the indoor and outdoor environments. An external
software service calculates and deploys the optimal interaction types per tile,
to best fit the needs of communicating devices. Evaluation via simulations
highlights the potential of the new concept.

average-excitatory case, a blow-up phenomenon occurs. This article is devoted
to the theoretical study of the NNLIF model in the case where a delay in the

global-in-time existence and uniqueness of classical solutions, independently
of the sign of the connectivity parameter, that is, for both cases: excitatory

asymptotic convergence to the stationary state for weak interconnections and a
non-existence result for periodic solutions if the connectivity parameter is
large enough. The proofs are mainly based on an appropriate change of variables
to rewrite the NNLIF equation as a Stefan-like free boundary problem,
constructions of universal super-solutions, the entropy dissipation method and

perceived color of a central region. There are two different types of color
induction: color contrast (the color of the central region shifts away from
that of the inducer) and color assimilation (the color shifts towards the color
of the inducer). Several studies on these effects used uniform and striped
surrounds, reporting color contrast and color assimilation, respectively. Other
authors (Kaneko and Murakami, J Vision, 2012) studied color induction using
flashed uniform surrounds, reporting that the contrast was higher for shorter
flash duration. Extending their work, we present new psychophysical results
using both flashed and static (i.e., non-flashed) equiluminant stimuli for both
striped and uniform surround. Similarly to them, for uniform surround stimuli
we observed color contrast, but we did not obtain the maximum contrast for the
shortest (10 ms) flashed stimuli, but for 40 ms. We only observed this maximum
contrast for red, green and lime inducers, while for a purple inducer we
obtained an asymptotic profile along flash duration. For striped stimuli, we
observed color assimilation only for the static (infinite flash duration)
red-green surround inducers (red 1st inducer, green 2nd inducer). For the other
inducers' configurations, we observed color contrast or no induction. Since
other works showed that non-equiluminant striped static stimuli induce color
assimilation, our results also suggest that luminance differences could be a
key factor to induce it.

identifies nonlinearities by sensitively detecting correlations among the
Fourier phases. The method, being called phase walk analysis, is based on well
established measures from random walk analysis, which are now applied to the
unwrapped Fourier phases of time series. We provide an analytical description
of its functionality and demonstrate its capabilities on systematically
controlled leptokurtic noise. Hereby, we investigate the properties of
leptokurtic time series and their influence on the Fourier phases of time
series. The phase walk analysis is applied to measured and simulated
intermittent time series, whose probability density distribution are
approximated by power laws. We use the day-to-day returns of the Dow-Jones
industrial average, a synthetic time series with tailored nonlinearities
mimicing the power law behavior of the Dow-Jones and the acceleration of wind
at an Atlantic offshore site. Testing for nonlinearities by means of surrogates
shows that the new method yields strong significances for nonlinear behavior.
Due to the drastically decreased computing time as compared to embedding space
methods the number of surrogate realizations can be increased by orders of
magnitude. Thereby, the probability distribution of the test statistics can
very accurately be derived and parametrized which allows for much more precise
tests on nonlinearities.
