some magnetically dominated regions. For instance, the funnel that is generated
in some highly magnetized disks configurations whereby relativistic jets are
thought to spread, or in pulsars where the fluids are subject to very intense
magnetic fields. With the aim of dealing with magnetic media in the
astrophysical context, we present for the first time the conservative form of
the GRMHD equations with a non-zero magnetic polarization vector $m^{\mu}$.
Then, we follow the Anile method to compute the eigenvalue structure in the
case where the magnetic polarization is parallel to the magnetic field, and it
is parametrized by the magnetic susceptibility $\chi_m$. This approximation
allows us to describe diamagnetic fluids, for which $\chi_m<0$, and
paramagnetic fluids where $\chi_m>0$. The theoretical results were implemented
in the CAFE code to study the role of the magnetic polarization in some 1D
Riemann problems. We found that independently of the initial condition, the
first waves that appear in the numerical solutions are faster in diamagnetic
materials than in paramagnetic ones. Moreover, the constant states between the
waves change notably for different magnetic susceptibilities. All these effects
are more appreciable if the magnetic pressure is much bigger than the fluid
pressure. Additionally, with the aim of analysing a magnetic media in a strong
gravitational field, we carry out for the first time the magnetized Michel
accretion of a magnetically polarized fluid. With this test, we found that the
numerical solution is effectively maintained over time ($t>4000$), and that the
global convergence of the code is $\gtrsim$ 2 for $\chi_{m}\lesssim 0.005$, for
all the magnetic field strength $\beta$ we considered.

dots leads to the formation of electron spin precession modes about an external
magnetic field which are resonant with the pumping periodicity. As the electron
spin is localized within a nuclear spin bath, its polarization imprints onto
the spin polarization of the bath. The latter acts back on the electron spin
polarization. We implement a pulse protocol where a train of laser pulses is
followed by a long, dark gap. It allows us to obtain a high-resolution
precession mode spectrum from the free evolution of the electron spin
polarization. Additionally, we vary the number of pump pulses in a train to
investigate the build-up of the precession modes. To separate out nuclear
effects, we suppress the nuclear polarization by using a radio-frequency field.
We find that a long-living nuclear spin polarization imprinted by the periodic
excitation significantly speeds up the buildup of the electron spin
polarization and induces the formation of additional electron spin precession
modes. To interpret these findings, we extend an established dynamical nuclear
polarization model to take into account optically detuned quantum dots for
which nuclear spins activate additional electron spin precession modes.

radial oxygen gradient calculated for the general PN population, which probes
the region between the Galactic center and out to $\sim$28 kpc, is shallow,
with slope $\sim$-0.02 dex kpc$^{-1}$, in agreement with previous findings. We
looked for time evolution of the metallicity gradient using PNe with different

are younger than 1 Gyr (YPPNe), and those whose progenitor stars are older than
7.5 Gyr (OPPNe), based on the comparison between evolutionary yields and
elemental abundances of the PNe. By studying OPPNe and YPPNe separately we
found that: (i) The OPPNe oxygen gradient is shallower ($\sim-0.015$ dex
kpc$^{-1}$) than that derived from YPPNe ($\sim-0.027$ dex kpc$^{-1}$); (ii)
the OPPNe inner radial distribution of oxygen is compatible with no gradient to
the radial extent of the thick disk population ($\sim$10 kpc), similarly to
what has been observed in thick disk stars; (iii) planetary nebulae (especially
OPPNe) indicate that significant gradient slope is limited to Galactocentric
distances between $\sim$10 to $\sim$13.5 kpc, as observed for open clusters and
field stars. Outside this range, the distribution is almost flat. We found that
the radial oxygen gradient is steeper for a PN population closer to the

Their significance is enormous since they have a strong influence on many

physics behind them. Inspired by this, we present a new family of analytical
models for thin disks composed by magnetized material. The solutions are
axially symmetric, conformastatic and are obtained by solving the
Einstein-Maxwell Field Equations for continuum media without the test field

energy density, the pressure, the polarization vector, the electromagnetic

proved. Since the solutions are well-behaved, they may be used to model
astrophysical thin disks, and also may contribute as initial data in numerical
simulations. In addition, the process to obtain the solutions is described in
detail, which may be used as a guide to find solutions with magnetized material

profile and of the pulsed fraction with flux points to a change of the emission
region geometry at the critical luminosity $L_{\rm crit}\sim3\times10^{38}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ both in the rising and declining parts of the outburst. We associate
the observed change with the onset of the accretion column, which allows us to

of filaments and their distribution with the Galactic disk where filaments form
self-consistently as part of large-scale molecular cloud evolution. In this
thesis, I perform dust radiative transfer calculations to study the effect of
inclination on dust observations of filaments to evaluate whether the
variations enable the identification of more filaments within dust surveys. I
address the early evolution of pc-scale filaments that form within individual
clouds and focus on how and when the filaments fragment, and how the
fragmentation relates to typically used observables. For evaluating the
equilibrium state of filaments and the nature of their fragmentation I examine
three simulated molecular clouds formed in kpc-scale numerical simulations
modelling a self-gravitating, magnetised, stratified, supernova-driven ISM. The
first fragments appear when the line masses of the simulated filaments lie well
below the critical line mass of Ostrikers isolated hydrostatic equilibrium
solution. This indicate that, although the turbulence of the entire clouds is
mostly driven by gravitational contraction, fragmentation does not occur do to
gravitational instability, but is supported by colliding flow motions. I
conclude that there is no single quantity in my analysis that can uniquely
trace the inclination and 3D structure of a filament based on dust observations
alone. A simple model of an isolated, isothermal cylinder may not provide a
good approach for fragmentation analysis, independently of the dominant driving
source of the parental cloud.

main results obtained in the recent years at the Quantum Technology Lab of the
Department of Physics ""Aldo Pontremoli"" of the University of Milan, also in
collaboration with national and international institutions. In particular we
focus on the application of continuous-variable optical quantum states and
operations to improve different field of research, ranging from interferometry
to more fundamental problems, such as the testing of quantum gravity.

Chargino-neutralino pair production, with decays via W/Z bosons, is studied in
final states involving leptons and jets and missing transverse momentum for
scenarios with large and intermediate mass-splittings between the parent
particle and lightest supersymmetric particle, as well as for the scenario
where this mass splitting is close to the mass of the Z boson. The latter case
is challenging since the vector bosons are produced with kinematic properties
that are similar to those in Standard Model processes. Results are found to be
compatible with the Standard Model expectations in the signal regions targeting
large and intermediate mass-splittings, and chargino-neutralino masses up to
600 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level for a massless lightest
supersymmetric particle. Excesses of data above the expected background are
found in the signal regions targeting low mass-splittings, and the largest
local excess amounts to 3.0 standard deviations.

Milanfar, is powerful image-recovery framework that aims to minimize an
explicit regularization objective constructed from a plug-in image-denoising
function. Experimental evidence suggests that the RED algorithms are
state-of-the-art. We claim, however, that explicit regularization does not
explain the RED algorithms. In particular, we show that many of the expressions

Jacobian, and we demonstrate that such symmetry does not occur with practical
denoisers such as non-local means, BM3D, TNRD, and DnCNN. To explain the RED
algorithms, we propose a new framework called Score-Matching by Denoising
(SMD), which aims to match a ""score"" (i.e., the gradient of a log-prior). We
then show tight connections between SMD, kernel density estimation, and
constrained minimum mean-squared error denoising. Furthermore, we interpret the
RED algorithms from Romano et al. and propose new algorithms with acceleration
and convergence guarantees. Finally, we show that the RED algorithms seek a
consensus equilibrium solution, which facilitates a comparison to plug-and-play
ADMM.

image interpretation, Bayesian modeling, and algorithmic processing. Such
atlases are typically constructed by grouping subjects with similar demographic
information. Importantly, use of the same scanner minimizes inter-group
variability. However, generalizability and spatial specificity of such
approaches is more limited than one might like. Inspired by Commowick
""Frankenstein's creature paradigm"" which builds a personal specific anatomical
atlas, we propose a data-driven framework to build a personal specific
probabilistic atlas under the large-scale data scheme. The data-driven
framework clusters regions with similar features using a point distribution
model to learn different anatomical phenotypes. Regional structural atlases and
corresponding regional probabilistic atlases are used as indices and targets in
the dictionary. By indexing the dictionary, the whole brain probabilistic
atlases adapt to each new subject quickly and can be used as spatial priors for
visualization and processing. The novelties of this approach are (1) it
provides a new perspective of generating personal specific whole brain
probabilistic atlases (132 regions) under data-driven scheme across sites. (2)
The framework employs the large amount of heterogeneous data (2349 images). (3)
The proposed framework achieves low computational cost since only one affine
registration and Pearson correlation operation are required for a new subject.
Our method matches individual regions better with higher Dice similarity value
when testing the probabilistic atlases. Importantly, the advantage the
large-scale scheme is demonstrated by the better performance of using
large-scale training data (1888 images) than smaller training set (720 images).

from the same flavor symmetry group in combination with CP symmetry. The first
approach is based on the residual symmetry $Z_2$ in the charged lepton sector
and $Z_2\times CP$ in the neutrino sector. All lepton mixing angles and CP
violation phases depend on three real parameters $\theta_{l}$, $\delta_{l}$ and
$\theta_{\nu}$. This approach is extended to the quark sector, the up and down
quark mass matrices are assumed to be invariant under a $Z_2$ subgroup and
$Z_2\times CP$. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the equivalence of
two mixing patterns are derived. The second approach has an abelian subgroup
and a single CP transformation as residual symmetries of the charged lepton and
neutrino sectors respectively. The lepton mixing would be determined up to a
real orthogonal matrix multiplied from the right hand side. Analogously we
assume that a single CP transformation is preserved by the down (or up) quark
mass matrix, and the residual symmetry of the up (or down) quark sector is be
an abelian subgroup. As an example, we analyze the possible mixing patterns
which can be obtained from the breaking of $\Delta(6n^2)$ and CP symmetries. We
find $\Delta(294)$ combined with CP is the smallest flavor group which can give
a good fit to the experimental data of quark and lepton mixing in both
approaches.

presence of very many redundant covariates. The variable selection problem is
most familiar in parametric environments such as the linear model or additive
variants thereof. In this work, we abandon the linear model framework, which
can be quite detrimental when the covariates impact the outcome in a non-linear
way, and turn to tree-based methods for variable selection. Such variable
screening is traditionally done by pruning down large trees or by ranking
variables based on some importance measure. Despite heavily used in practice,
these ad-hoc selection rules are not yet well understood from a theoretical
point of view. In this work, we devise a Bayesian tree-based probabilistic
method and show that it is consistent for variable selection when the
regression surface is a smooth mix of $p>n$ covariates. These results are the
first model selection consistency results for Bayesian forest priors.
Probabilistic assessment of variable importance is made feasible by a
spike-and-slab wrapper around sum-of-trees priors. Sampling from posterior
distributions over trees is inherently very difficult. As an alternative to
MCMC, we propose ABC Bayesian Forests, a new ABC sampling method based on
data-splitting that achieves higher ABC acceptance rate. We show that the
method is robust and successful at finding variables with high marginal
inclusion probabilities. Our ABC algorithm provides a new avenue towards
approximating the median probability model in non-parametric setups where the
marginal likelihood is intractable.

Dilatation of the lateral ventricles in the brain is a risk factor for poorer
neurodevelopment outcomes in infants. Hence, 3D US has the ability to assess
the volume of the lateral ventricles similar to clinically standard MRI, but
manual segmentation is time consuming. The objective of this study is to
develop an approach quantifying the ratio of lateral ventricular dilatation
with respect to total brain volume using 3D US, which can assess the severity
of macrocephaly. Automatic segmentation of the lateral ventricles is achieved
with a multi-atlas deformable registration approach using locally linear
correlation metrics for US-MRI fusion, followed by a refinement step using
deformable mesh models. Total brain volume is estimated using a 3D ellipsoid
modeling approach. Validation was performed on a cohort of 12 infants, ranging
from 2 to 8.5 months old, where 3D US and MRI were used to compare brain
volumes and segmented lateral ventricles. Automatically extracted volumes from
3D US show a high correlation and no statistically significant difference when
compared to ground truth measurements. Differences in volume ratios was 6.0 +/-
4.8% compared to MRI, while lateral ventricular segmentation yielded a mean
Dice coefficient of 70.8 +/- 3.6% and a mean absolute distance (MAD) of 0.88
+/- 0.2mm, demonstrating the clinical benefit of this tool in paediatric
ultrasound.

  models through predictive simulations","24 pages, 13 figures, 2 tables",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Typically, discrete choice modelers develop ever-more advanced models and
estimation methods. Compared to the impressive progress in model development
and estimation, model-checking techniques have lagged behind. Often, choice
modelers use only crude methods to assess how well an estimated model
represents reality. Such methods usually stop at checking parameter signs,
model elasticities, and ratios of model coefficients. In this paper, I greatly
expand the discrete choice modelers' assessment toolkit by introducing model
checking procedures based on graphical displays of predictive simulations.
  Overall, my contributions are as follows. Methodologically, I introduce a
general and 'semi-automatic' algorithm for checking discrete choice models via
predictive simulations. By combining new graphical displays with existing
plots, I introduce methods for checking one's data against one's model in terms
of the model's predicted distributions of choices (P(Y)), choices given
explanatory variables (P(Y|X)), and explanatory variables given choices
(P(X|Y)). Empirically, I demonstrate my proposed methods by checking the models
from Brownstone and Train (1998). Through this case study, I show that my
proposed methods can point out lack-of-model-fit in one's models and suggest

by writing programs that displayed intelligent behavior. Many good ideas came
out from this work but programs written by hand were not robust or general.
After the 80s, research increasingly shifted to the development of learners
capable of inferring behavior and functions from experience and data, and
solvers capable of tackling well-defined but intractable models like SAT,
classical planning, Bayesian networks, and POMDPs. The learning approach has
achieved considerable success but results in black boxes that do not have the
flexibility, transparency, and generality of their model-based counterparts.
Model-based approaches, on the other hand, require models and scalable
algorithms. Model-free learners and model-based solvers have close parallels
with Systems 1 and 2 in current theories of the human mind: the first, a fast,
opaque, and inflexible intuitive mind; the second, a slow, transparent, and
flexible analytical mind. In this paper, I review developments in AI and draw
on these theories to discuss the gap between model-free learners and
model-based solvers, a gap that needs to be bridged in order to have
intelligent systems that are robust and general.

IV (an association inhibited by cyanide) and diffusible reactive oxygen species
(DROS) are considered wasteful and toxic products. With new mechanistic
insights on heme and flavin enzymes, an oxygen or DROS centric explanation
(called murburn concept) was recently proposed for mOxPhos. In the new
mechanism, TMP is not directly harnessed, protons are a rate limiting reactant
and DROS within matrix serve as the chemical coupling agents that directly link
NADH oxidation with ATP synthesis. Herein, we report multiple ADP binding sites
and solvent accessible DROS channels in respiratory proteins, which validate
the oxygen or DROS centric power generation (ATP synthesis) system in mOxPhos.
Since cyanide's heme binding Kd is high (mM), low doses (uM) of cyanide is
lethal because cyanide disrupts DROS dynamics in mOxPhos. The critical study
also provides comprehensive arguments against Mitchell's and Boyer's

($\epsilon'/\epsilon$) and lepton-flavor universality violation in $B$ meson
decays ($R_{K^{(*)}},{R_{D^{(*)}}}$), by proposing flavorful and chiral vector
bosons as the new physics constitution at around TeV scale. The
chiral-flavorful vectors (CFVs) are introduced as a 63-plet of the global
$SU(8)$ symmetry, identified as the one-family symmetry for left-handed quarks
and leptons in the standard model (SM) forming the 8-dimensional vector. Thus
the CFVs include massive gluons, vector leptoquarks, and $W',Z'$-type bosons,
which are allowed to have flavorful couplings with left-handed quarks and
leptons, and flavor-universal couplings to right-handed ones, where the latter
arises from mixing with the SM gauge bosons. The flavor texture is assumed to
possess a ""minimal"" structure to be consistent with the current flavor
measurements on the $K$ and $B$ systems. Among the presently reported
significant flavor anomalies in the Kaon and $B$ meson systems
($\epsilon'/\epsilon$, $R_{K^{(*)}}, {R_{D^{(*)}}}$), the first two
$\epsilon'/\epsilon$ and $R_{K^{(*)}}$ anomalies can simultaneously be
interpreted by the presence of CFVs, the ${R_{D^{(*)}}}$ anomaly is predicted
not to survive, due to the approximate $SU(8)$ flavor symmetry. Remarkably, we
find that as long as both of the $\epsilon'/\epsilon$ and $R_{K^{(*)}}$
anomalies persist beyond the SM, the CFVs predict the enhanced $K^+ \to \pi^+
\nu \bar{\nu}$ and $K_L \to \pi^0 \nu \bar{\nu}$ decay rates compared to the SM
values, which will readily be explored by the NA62 and KOTO experiments, and

tumor segmentation, specifically, fully convolutional networks (FCNs). FCNs can
segment a set of voxels at once, having a direct spatial correspondence between
units in feature maps (FMs) at a given location and the corresponding

so, channel combination is crucial. However, not all FMs have the same
relevance for a given class. Recently, in classification problems,
Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks have been proposed to re-calibrate FMs as a
whole, and suppress the less informative ones. However, this is not optimal in
FCN due to the spatial correspondence between units and voxels. In this

compression to create more complex features for semantic segmentation.

recalibration that collects contextual information, while maintaining the
spatial meaning. Finally, we evaluate the proposed methods in brain tumor

interaction (SSI) regulations of ASCE 7-16 on seismic performance of building
structures. The motivation for this research stems from the significant changes
in the new SSI provisions of ASCE 7-16 compared to the previous 2010 edition.
Generally, ASCE 7 considers SSI as a beneficial effect, and allows designer to
reduce the design base shear. However, literature shows that this idea cannot
properly capture the SSI effects on nonlinear systems. ASCE 7-16 is the first
edition of ASCE 7 that considers the SSI effect on yielding systems. This study
investigates the consequences of practicing the new provisions on a wide range
of buildings with different dynamic characteristics on different soil types.
Ductility demand of the structure forms the performance metric of this study,
and the probability that practicing SSI provisions, in lieu of fixed-base
provisions, increases the ductility demand of the structure is computed. The
analyses are conducted within a probabilistic framework which considers the
uncertainties in the ground motion and in the properties of the soil-structure
system. It is concluded that, for structures with surface foundation on
moderate to soft soils, SSI regulations of both ASCE 7-10 and ASCE 7-16 are
fairly likely to result in a similar and larger structural responses than those
obtained by practicing the fixed-base design regulations. However, for squat
and ordinary stiff structures on soft soil or structures with embedded
foundation on moderate to soft soils, the SSI provisions of ASCE 7-16 result in
performance levels that are closer to those obtained by practicing the
fixed-base regulations. Finally, for structures on very soft soils, the new SSI
provisions of ASCE 7-16 are likely to rather conservative designs.

transition, including empirical, simulation-based, and theoretical
prescriptions. Most of these models rely on the surface density of neutral
hydrogen and the ultraviolet (UV) flux in the Lyman-Werner band as input
parameters. Computing these quantities on the kiloparsec scales resolved by the

length approximation to the column density of a system can be biased and
exhibits large cell-to-cell scatter. Instead, we propose to compute all surface
quantities in face-on projections and perform the modeling in two dimensions.
In general, the two methods agree on average, but their predictions diverge for
individual galaxies and for models based on the observed midplane pressure of
galaxies. We model the UV radiation from young stars by assuming a constant
escape fraction and optically thin propagation throughout the galaxy. With
these improvements, we find that the five models for the atomic-to-molecular

for individual galaxies and the spatial distribution of molecular hydrogen. We
emphasize that the estimated molecular fractions are approximate due to the
significant systematic uncertainties.

consistent with an average wind column density that is fairly steady between
observations but varies rapidly with the source on timescales of seconds. The

driven by present-day trends in computing architectures. Discontinuous Galerkin
methods have recently gained some traction in astrophysics, because of their
arbitrarily high order and controllable numerical diffusion, combined with
attractive characteristics for high performance computing. In this paper, we
describe and test our implementation of a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme
for ideal magnetohydrodynamics in the AREPO-DG code. Our DG-MHD scheme relies
on a modal expansion of the solution on Legendre polynomials inside the cells
of an Eulerian octree-based AMR grid. The divergence-free constraint of the
magnetic field is enforced using one out of two distinct cell-centred schemes:
either a Powell-type scheme based on nonconservative source terms, or a
hyperbolic divergence cleaning method. The Powell scheme relies on a basis of
locally divergence-free vector polynomials inside each cell to represent the
magnetic field. Limiting prescriptions are implemented to ensure
non-oscillatory and positive solutions. We show that the resulting scheme is
accurate and robust: it can achieve high-order and low numerical diffusion, as
well as accurately capture strong MHD shocks. In addition, we show that our
scheme exhibits a number of attractive properties for astrophysical
simulations, such as lower advection errors and better Galilean invariance at
reduced resolution, together with more accurate capturing of barely resolved
flow features. We discuss the prospects of our implementation, and DG methods
in general, for scalable astrophysical simulations.

In this paper, we use electromagnetic observations to constrain the SMBBH

background, we suppose that equal-mass SMBBH mergers fully account for the
local black hole number density. This yields a maximum characteristic signal
amplitude at a period of one year $A_{\rm{yr}}<2.4\times 10^{-15}$, which is

requires an electromagnetic observation of an SMBBH. While a number of

evolution of neutron star-neutron star and black hole-neutron star mergers.
Most notably, they determine the properties of the bright optical/infrared
transients observable after a merger. Unfortunately, Boltzmann's equations of
radiation transport remain too costly to be evolved directly in merger
simulations. Simulations rely instead on approximate transport algorithms with
unquantified modeling errors. In this paper, we use for the first time a
time-dependent general relativistic Monte-Carlo (MC) algorithm to solve
Boltzmann's equations and estimate important properties of the neutrino
distribution function ~10ms after a neutron star merger. We do not fully couple
the MC algorithm to the fluid evolution, but use a short evolution of the
merger remnant to critically assess errors in our approximate gray two-moment
transport scheme. We demonstrate that the analytical closure used by the moment
scheme is highly inaccurate in the polar regions, but performs well elsewhere.
While the average energy of polar neutrinos is reasonably well captured by the
two-moment scheme, estimates for the neutrino energy become less accurate at
lower latitudes. The two-moment formalism also overestimates the density of
neutrinos in the polar regions by ~50%, and underestimates the neutrino
pair-annihilation rate at the poles by factors of 2-3. Although the latter is
significantly more accurate than one might have expected before this study, our
results indicate that predictions for the properties of polar outflows and for
the creation of a baryon-free region at the poles are likely to be affected by
errors in the two-moment scheme, thus limiting our ability to reliably model
kilonovae and gamma-ray bursts.

accounting for the first time for the evolution of GCs within their host

to its present value due to evaporation and tidal disruption. Many BH binaries
that were ejected long before their merger, originated in GCs that no longer

magnetic reconnection in magnetars, triggered by Axion Quark Nugget (AQN) dark
matter. In this model, the magnetic reconnection is ignited by the shock wave
which develops when the nuggets' Mach number $M \gg 1$. These shock waves
generate very strong and very short impulses expressed in terms of pressure
$\Delta p/p\sim M^2$ and temperature $\Delta T/T\sim M^2$ in the vicinity of
(would be) magnetic reconnection area. We find that the proposed mechanism
produces a coherent emission which is consistent with current data, in
particular the FRB energy requirements, the observed energy distribution, the
frequency range and the burst duration. Our model allows us to propose
additional tests which future data will be able to challenge.

large-angle CMB features in order to evaluate their covariance in LCDM. We do
so using two sets of simulated CMB temperature maps; an ensemble of 100,000
simple Gaussian simulations, and 1000 Full Focal Plane (FFP) simulations

pay particular attention to analysis choices, making sure that we can reproduce
previous results in the literature, and explain differences where appropriate.
The covariance structure we find is consistent with expectations given that
many of the features studied are functions of the angular power spectrum.
Notably, we find significant differences in the covariance entries associated
with the quadrupole-octopole alignments derived from the Gaussian and FFP
simulations. We additionally perform a principal component analysis to
quantitatively gauge what combinations of features capture the most information
about how simulation measurements vary, and to provide an alternative
assessment of the ways in which the real sky is anomalous. The first four
principal components explain about 90\% of the simulations' variance, with the
first two roughly quantifying the lack of large-angle correlations, and the
next two quantifying the phase-dependent anomalies (multipole alignments and

By running a randomized benchmarking protocol in the logical code space of the

the benefit of carrying out computation in a code space that can detect errors.
Although the fault-tolerant gates offer an impressive improvement in fidelity,
the computation as a whole is not below the fault-tolerance threshold because
of noise associated with state preparation and measurement on this device.

environments are less understood than classical elliptical galaxies in
high-density environments. Isolated galaxies are defined as galaxies without
massive neighbors within scales of galaxy groups. The effect of the environment
at several Mpc scales on their properties has been barely explored. Here we
study the role of large-scale environment in some physical properties of 573
isolated elliptical galaxies out to z=0.08. We use three environmental
estimators of the large-scale structure within a projected radius of 5 Mpc
around isolated galaxies: the tidal strength parameter, the projected density
eta_k, and the distance to the fifth nearest neighbor galaxy. We find 80% of
galaxies at lower densities correspond to 'red and dead' elliptical galaxies.
Blue and red galaxies do not tend to be located in different environments
according to eta_k. Almost all the isolated ellipticals in the densest
large-scale environments are red or quenched, where a third of them are
low-mass galaxies. The percentage of isolated elliptical galaxies located in
the AGN region of the BPT diagram is 64%. We have identified 33 blue,
star-forming isolated ellipticals using both color and sSFR. Half of them are
star-forming nuclei in the BPT diagram, which is 5% of the galaxies in this
diagram. The large-scale environment is not playing the primary role to
determine the color or sSFR of isolated elliptical galaxies. The large-scale
environment seems to be negligible from a stellar mass scale around 10^10.6
Msun, probably because of the dominant presence of AGN at higher masses. For
lower masses, the processes of cooling and infall of gas from large scales are
very inefficient in ellipticals. AGN might also be an essential ingredient to
keep most of the low-mass isolated elliptical galaxies quenched.

In the transition from star-forming to quenched galaxies, Active galactic
nuclei (AGN) have also a principal action. However, the connections between
these three actors are still uncertain. In this work we investigate the effects
of stellar mass and the large-scale environment (LSS), on the fraction of
optical nuclear activity in a population of isolated galaxies, where AGN would
not be triggered by recent galaxy interactions or mergers. As a continuation of
a previous work, we focus on isolated galaxies to study the effect of stellar
mass and the LSS in terms of morphology (early- and late-type), colour (red and
blue), and specific star formation rate (quenched and star-forming). To explore
where AGN activity is affected by the LSS we fix the stellar mass into low- and
high-mass galaxies. We use the tidal strength parameter to quantify their
effects. We found that AGN is strongly affected by stellar mass in 'active'
galaxies (namely late-type, blue, and star-forming), however it has no
influence for 'quiescent' galaxies (namely early-type, red, and quenched), at
least for masses down to $\rm 10^{10}\,[M_\odot]$. In relation to the LSS, we
found an increment on the fraction of SFN with denser LSS in low-mass star
forming and red isolated galaxies. Regarding AGN, we find a clear increment of
the fraction of AGN with denser environment in quenched and red isolated
galaxies, independently of the stellar mass. AGN activity would be 'mass
triggered' in 'active' isolated galaxies. This means that AGN is independent of
the intrinsic property of the galaxies, but on its stellar mass. On the other
hand, AGN would be 'environment triggered' in 'quiescent' isolated galaxies,
where the fraction of AGN in terms of sSFR and colour increases from void
regions to denser LSS, independently of its stellar mass.

\to \ell^+ \ell^-$) process, we find the most stringent limits obtained to
date, outperforming bounds from pair production and atomic parity violation. We
show that, with 3000 fb$^{-1}$ of data, combined measurements of the transverse
mass in $p p \to \ell^\pm \nu$ events and invariant mass in $p p \to \ell^+
\ell^-$ events can probe masses between 8 TeV and 18 TeV, depending on the
species of leptoquark, for electroweak-sized couplings. In light of such robust
sensitivities, we strongly encourage the LHC experiments to interpret Drell-Yan
(dilepton and monolepton) events in terms of leptoquarks, alongside usual
scenarios like $Z'$ bosons and contact interactions.

this purpose, a frequentionistic interpretation of the DST developed in
{Klopotek:93b} is exploited. A special notion of conditionality for DST is
introduced and demonstrated to behave with respect to Pearl's d-separation
{Geiger:90} much the same way as conditional probability (though some
differences like non-uniqueness are evident). Based on this, an algorithm
analogous to that from {Spirtes:90b} is developed.
  The notion of a partially oriented graph (pog) is introduced and within this
graph the notion of p-d-separation is defined. If direct dependence test and
head-to-head meeting test are used to orient the pog then its p-d-separation is
shown to be equivalent to the Pearl's d-separation for any compatible dag.

searches that analyze GBM continuous time tagged event (CTTE) data. Here we
examine the efficiency of a method developed to search CTTE data for
sub-threshold transient events in temporal coincidence with LIGO/Virgo compact
binary coalescence triggers. This targeted search operates by coherently
combining data from all 14 GBM detectors by taking into account the complex
spatial and energy dependent response of each detector. We use the method to
examine a sample of SGRBs that were independently detected by the Burst Alert
Telescope on board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, but which were too
intrinsically weak or viewed with unfavorable instrument geometry to initiate
an on-board trigger of GBM. We find that the search can successfully recover a
majority of the BAT detected sample in the CTTE data. We show that the targeted
search of CTTE data will be crucial in increasing the GBM sensitivity, and
hence the gamma-ray horizon, to weak events such as GRB 170817A. We also
examine the properties of the GBM signal possibly associated with the LIGO
detection of GW150914 and show that it is consistent with the observed
properties of other sub-threshold SGRBs in our sample. We find that the
targeted search is capable of recovering true astrophysical signals as weak as

constraints on what one can infer about the final state of a system based on
its initial state, where such inferences are based not just on the cause-effect

particularly broadened after its hybridization with the gold surface states. In
addition, the boron atoms shift the conduction and valence bands of the

dust-replenishing requires the presence of a reservoir of planetesimals. These
planetesimals in the parent belt of debris disks orbit their host star and
continuously supply the disk with fine dust through their mutual collisions.
  Aims: We aim to understand effects of different collisional parameters on the
observational appearance of eccentric debris disks.
  Methods: The collisional evolution of selected debris disk configurations was
simulated with the numerical code ACE. Subsequently, selected observable
quantities are simulated with our newly developed code DMS. The impact of the
eccentricity, dynamical excitation, and the material strength is discussed with
respect to the grain size distribution, the spectral energy distribution, and
spatially resolved images of debris disk systems.
  Results: The most recognizable features in different collisional evolutions
are as follows. First, both the increase of dynamical excitation in the
eccentric belt of the debris disk system and the decrease of the material
strength of dust particles result in a higher production rate of smaller
particles. This reduces the surface brightness differences between the
periastron and the apastron sides of the disks. For very low material
strengths, the ""pericenter glow"" phenomenon is reduced and eventually even
replaced by the opposite effect, the ""apocenter glow"". Second, it is possible
to constrain the level of collisional activity from the appearance of the disk,
for example, the wavelength-dependent apocenter-to-pericenter flux ratio.
Within the considered parameter space, the impact of the material strength on
the appearance of the disk is stronger than that of dynamical excitation of the
system. Finally, we find that the impact of the collisional parameters on the

universe should be teeming with intelligent life is linked to models like the
Drake equation, which suggest that even if the probability of intelligent life
developing at a given site is small, the sheer multitude of possible sites
should nonetheless yield a large number of potentially observable
civilizations. We show that this conflict arises from the use of Drake-like
equations, which implicitly assume certainty regarding highly uncertain
parameters. We examine these parameters, incorporating models of chemical and
genetic transitions on paths to the origin of life, and show that extant
scientific knowledge corresponds to uncertainties that span multiple orders of
magnitude. This makes a stark difference. When the model is recast to represent
realistic distributions of uncertainty, we find a substantial {\em ex ante}
probability of there being no other intelligent life in our observable
universe, and thus that there should be little surprise when we fail to detect
any signs of it. This result dissolves the Fermi paradox, and in doing so
removes any need to invoke speculative mechanisms by which civilizations would
inevitably fail to have observable effects upon the universe.

follows: (a) From the root channel $W$ synthesize recursively a series of
channels $W_N^{(1)},\dotsc,W_N^{(N)}$. (b) Select sophisticatedly a subset $A$
of synthetic channels. (c) Transmit information using synthetic channels
indexed by $A$ and freeze the remaining synthetic channels.
  Arikan gives each synthetic channel a score (called the Bhattacharyya
parameter) that determines whether it should be selected or frozen. As $N$
grows, a majority of the scores are either very high or very low, i.e., they
polarize. By characterizing how fast they polarize, Arikan showed that polar
coding is able to produce a series of codes that achieve capacity on symmetric
binary-input memoryless channels.
  In measuring how the scores polarize the relation among block length, gap to
capacity, and block error probability are studied. In particular, the error
exponent regime fixes the gap to capacity and varies the other two. The scaling
exponent regime fixes the block error probability and varies the other two. The
moderate deviation regime varies all three factors at once.
  The latest result [arxiv:1501.02444, Theorem 7] in the moderate deviation
regime does not imply the scaling exponent regime as a special case. We give a
result that does. (See Corollary 8.)

extension of space-time has the following features: (i) It admits an infinite
number of trapped, anti-trapped and asymptotic regions; (ii) All curvature
scalars have uniform (i.e., mass independent) upper bounds; (iii) In the large
mass limit, all asymptotic regions of the extension have the same ADM mass;
(iv) In the low curvature region (e.g., near horizons) quantum effects are
negligible, as one would physically expect; and (v) Final results are
insensitive to the fiducial structures that have to be introduced to construct
the classical phase space description (as they must be). Previous effective
theories [1-10] shared some but not all of these features. We compare and

practice that is associated with societal, economic and public-safety benefits.
Despite this fact, broadband subscribers are usually hesitant to freely share
their broadband connection with guests for a multitude of reasons; one of them
being sharing their network might hinder their own broadband quality of
experience. In this paper, we investigate experimentally the impact of uplink
guest traffic on the sharer's broadband quality of experience under both
generic and broadband-sharing-specific packet scheduling policies. Both
guest-user traffic and access point profiles employed in our study are
developed by analyzing real-world traffic traces and measurements, captured
from actual broadband sharing networking environments. Our results validate the
suitability of hybrid packet scheduling policies for broadband sharing schemes
and show that only a few dozen kilobytes per second of uplink guest traffic can
be tolerated by sharers without hampering their broadband quality of
experience. In this context, we show that the selection of the most appropriate
packet scheduling policy for broadband sharing, as well as its respective
configuration, depend largely on the capacity of the broadband connection and
the policy's packet-dropping behavior on guest traffic.

concerns inference in an important subclass of HBNs, the conditional Gaussian
(CG) networks, in which all continuous random variables have Gaussian
distributions and all children of continuous random variables must be
continuous. Inference in CG networks can be NP-hard even for special-case
structures, such as poly-trees, where inference in discrete Bayesian networks
can be performed in polynomial time. Therefore, approximate inference is
required. In approximate inference, it is often necessary to trade off accuracy
against solution time. This paper presents an extension to the Hybrid Message
Passing inference algorithm for general CG networks and an algorithm for
optimizing its accuracy given a bound on computation time. The extended
algorithm uses Gaussian mixture reduction to prevent an exponential increase in
the number of Gaussian mixture components. The trade-off algorithm performs
pre-processing to find optimal run-time settings for the extended algorithm.
Experimental results for four CG networks compare performance of the extended
algorithm with existing algorithms and show the optimal settings for these CG
networks.

a stochastic variational inference method for Gaussian process (GP) preference

convincingness from crowdsourced data, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art, particularly when trained with small amounts of unreliable
data. We demonstrate how the Bayesian approach enables more effective active
learning, thereby reducing the amount of data required to identify convincing

with neural networks, our results show that word embeddings in combination with
linguistic features also benefit GPs when predicting argument convincingness.

human mental and physical activities such as Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act,

semantically rich representation to handle a complex real world situation and
ability to reason under uncertainty about the situation. Multi-Entity Bayesian
Networks (MEBNs) combines First-Order Logic with Bayesian Networks for
representing and reasoning about uncertainty in complex, knowledge-rich
domains. MEBN goes beyond standard Bayesian networks to enable reasoning about
an unknown number of entities interacting with each other in various types of
relationships, a key requirement for the OODA process of an AI system. MEBN
models have heretofore been constructed manually by a domain expert. However,
manual MEBN modeling is labor-intensive and insufficiently agile. To address
these problems, an efficient method is needed for MEBN modeling. One of the
methods is to use machine learning to learn a MEBN model in whole or in part
from data. In the era of Big Data, data-rich environments, characterized by
uncertainty and complexity, have become ubiquitous. The larger the data sample
is, the more accurate the results of the machine learning approach can be.
Therefore, machine learning has potential to improve the quality of MEBN models
as well as the effectiveness for MEBN modeling. In this research, we study a
MEBN learning framework to develop a MEBN model from a combination of domain
expert's knowledge and data. To evaluate the MEBN learning framework, we
conduct an experiment to compare the MEBN learning framework and the existing
manual MEBN modeling in terms of development efficiency.

entirely the result of grammar constraints, and thus some repetition must
result from human choice. While the evidence we find of similar repetitive

scene geometry, is an ill-posed problem. Recent methods have gained significant
improvement by exploring image-level information and hierarchical features from
deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). These methods model depth
estimation as a regression problem and train the regression networks by
minimizing mean squared error, which suffers from slow convergence and
unsatisfactory local solutions. Besides, existing depth estimation networks
employ repeated spatial pooling operations, resulting in undesirable
low-resolution feature maps. To obtain high-resolution depth maps,
skip-connections or multi-layer deconvolution networks are required, which
complicates network training and consumes much more computations. To eliminate
or at least largely reduce these problems, we introduce a spacing-increasing
discretization (SID) strategy to discretize depth and recast depth network
learning as an ordinal regression problem. By training the network using an
ordinary regression loss, our method achieves much higher accuracy and
\dd{faster convergence in synch}. Furthermore, we adopt a multi-scale network
structure which avoids unnecessary spatial pooling and captures multi-scale
information in parallel.

combining Bayesian Networks (BN) with First-Order Logic (FOL). MEBN has
sufficient expressive power for general-purpose knowledge representation and
reasoning. Developing a MEBN model to support a given application is a
challenge, requiring definition of entities, relationships, random variables,
conditional dependence relationships, and probability distributions. When
available, data can be invaluable both to improve performance and to streamline
development. By far the most common format for available data is the relational
database (RDB). Relational databases describe and organize data according to
the Relational Model (RM). Developing a MEBN model from data stored in an RDB
therefore requires mapping between the two formalisms. This paper presents
MEBN-RM, a set of mapping rules between key elements of MEBN and RM. We
identify links between the two languages (RM and MEBN) and define four levels

  Situation Awareness",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  During the past quarter-century, situation awareness (SAW) has become a
critical research theme, because of its importance. Since the concept of SAW
was first introduced during World War I, various versions of SAW have been
researched and introduced. Predictive Situation Awareness (PSAW) focuses on the
ability to predict aspects of a temporally evolving situation over time. PSAW
requires a formal representation and a reasoning method using such a
representation. A Multi-Entity Bayesian Network (MEBN) is a knowledge
representation formalism combining Bayesian Networks (BN) with First-Order
Logic (FOL). MEBN can be used to represent uncertain situations (supported by
BN) as well as complex situations (supported by FOL). Also, efficient reasoning
algorithms for MEBN have been developed. MEBN can be a formal representation to
support PSAW and has been used for several PSAW systems. Although several MEBN
applications for PSAW exist, very little work can be found in the literature
that attempts to generalize a MEBN model to support PSAW. In this research, we
define a reference model for MEBN in PSAW, called a PSAW-MEBN reference model.
The PSAW-MEBN reference model enables us to easily develop a MEBN model for
PSAW by supporting the design of a MEBN model for PSAW. In this research, we
introduce two example use cases using the PSAW-MEBN reference model to develop
MEBN models to support PSAW: a Smart Manufacturing System and a Maritime Domain
Awareness System.

  efficient data augmentation",,,,,"stat.CO stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Advances in sampling schemes for Markov jump processes have recently enabled
multiple inferential tasks. However, in statistical and machine learning
applications, we often require that these continuous-time models find support
on structured and infinite state spaces. In these cases, exact sampling may
only be achieved by often inefficient particle filtering procedures, and
rapidly augmenting observed datasets remains a significant challenge. Here, we
build on the principles of uniformization and present a tractable framework to
address this problem, which greatly improves the efficiency of existing
state-of-the-art methods commonly used in small finite-state systems, and
further scales their use to infinite-state scenarios. We capitalize on the
marginal role of variable subsets in a model hierarchy during the process
jumps, and describe an algorithm that relies on measurable mappings between
pairs of states and carefully designed sets of synthetic jump observations. The
proposed method enables the efficient integration of slice sampling techniques
and it can overcome the existing computational bottleneck. We offer evidence by
means of experiments addressing inference and clustering tasks on both
simulated and real data sets.

to sterile neutrino oscillation signatures in the anti-neutrino energy spectrum
as a function of the distance to the core and energy. Performing a precise
search requires high light yield of the scintillating elements and uniformity
of the response in the detector volume. The SoLid experiment uses an innovative
hybrid technology with two different scintillators: polyvinyltoluene
scintillator cubes and $^6$LiF:ZnS(Ag) screens. A precision test bench based on
a $^{207}$Bi calibration source has been developed to study improvements on the
energy resolution and uniformity of the prompt scintillation signal of
antineutrino interactions. A trigger system selecting the 1~MeV conversion
electrons provides a Gaussian energy peak and allows for precise comparisons of
the different detector configurations that were considered to improve the SoLid
detector light collection. The light collection efficiency is influenced by the
choice of wrapping material, the position of the $^6$LiF:ZnS(Ag) screen, the
type of fibre, the number of optical fibres and the type of mirror at the end
of the fibre. This study shows that large gains in light collection efficiency
are possible compared to the SoLid SM1 prototype. The light yield for the SoLid

with a relative non-uniformity of 6 %, demonstrating that the required energy

examine factors associated with preterm related mortality rate (PMR). Methods:
Using linked birth-infant deaths files, we examined patterns in the leading
causes of IMR. We compared these rates at both national and state levels to
find reduction trends. Creating a cross-sectional time series of states' PMR
and some explanatory variables, we implemented a fixed-effect regression model.
Results: We found substantial state-level variations in changes of the IMR
(range= -2.87 to 2.08) and PMR (-1.77 to 0.67). Twenty-one states in which the
IMR declined more than the national average of 0.99 (6.89 to 5.90) were labeled
as successful. In the successful states, we found a reduction in the PMR
accounted for the largest decline in the IMR (0.90 fewer deaths). Changes in
the other subgroups of leading causes did not differ significantly in
successful and unsuccessful states. Policy Implications: Although its impact is
not large, reducing the percentage of pregnant women with inadequate care is
one of the mechanisms through which the PMR might decrease.

excellent spin lifetimes up to 7.8 ns in dual-gated bilayer graphene.
Remarkably, this realizes the manipulation of spins in graphene by
electrically-controlled spin-orbit fields, which is unexpected due to
graphene's weak intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. We utilize both the in-plane
magnetic field Hanle precession and oblique Hanle precession measurements to
directly compare the lifetimes of out-of-plane vs. in-plane spins. We find that
near the charge neutrality point, the application of a perpendicular electric
field opens a band gap and generates an out-of-plane spin-orbit field that
stabilizes out-of-plane spins against spin relaxation, leading to a large spin
lifetime anisotropy. This intriguing behavior occurs because of the unique
spin-valley coupled band structure of bilayer graphene. Our results demonstrate
the potential for highly tunable spintronic devices based on dual-gated 2D
materials.

study the low-energy two-body scattering processes of spin-$1/2$ fermions in
spin-orbit coupled optical lattices. We demonstrate that, under weak SOC,
adding a small lattice potential would destabilize shallow two-body bound
states, contrary to conventional wisdom. On the other hand, when lattice is
sufficiently deep, two-body bound states are always stabilized by increasing
the lattice depth. This intriguing non-monotonic behavior of the bound-state
stability derives from the competition between SOC and optical lattices, and
can be explained by analyzing the low-energy density of states. We also discuss
the impact of high-band effects on such a behavior, as well as potential

the extensive use of downsampling and upsampling in the interlinking layers,

proposed for face parsing and both stages use iCNN. The first stage localizes

In homogeneous environments, the alternative states are separated by a smooth
front moving at a constant velocity. This simple picture can break down in
structured environments such as tissues, patchy landscapes, and microfluidic
devices. Habitat fragmentation can pin the front at a particular location or
lock invasion velocities into specific values. Locked velocities are not
sensitive to moderate changes in dispersal or growth and are determined by the
spatial and temporal periodicity of the environment. The synchronization with
the environment results in discontinuous fronts that propagate as periodic
pulses. We characterize the transition from continuous to locked invasions and
show that it is controlled by positive density-dependence in dispersal or
growth. We also demonstrate that velocity locking is robust to demographic and
environmental fluctuations and examine stochastic dynamics and evolution in

""controls"" a lower-level dynamic problem, which optimizes dispensing decisions
that take into consideration the heterogeneous utility functions of the random

affect the timing performance of the PET detector are investigated. By
experimental measurement, we found that the CTR is heavily related to the
bandwidth of the amplifier, bias voltage of SiPM, comparator threshold, and PZ
network parameter. The test setup has two detectors, one with LYSO crystal (3

LaBr3 coupled to a PMT-R9800. After the optimization of the readout circuit

Jones, Rami Melhem","Mitigating Wordline Crosstalk using Adaptive Trees of Counters","12 pages",,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  High access frequency of certain rows in the DRAM may cause data loss in
cells of physically adjacent rows due to crosstalk. The malicious exploit of
this crosstalk by repeatedly accessing a row to induce this effect is known as
row hammering. Additionally, inadvertent row hammering may also occur due to
the natural weighted nature of applications' access patterns.
  In this paper, we analyze the efficiency of existing approaches for
mitigating wordline crosstalk and demonstrate that they have been
conservatively designed. Given the unbalanced nature of DRAM accesses, a small
group of dynamically allocated counters in banks can deterministically detect
hot rows and mitigate crosstalk. Based on our findings, we propose a
Counter-based Adaptive Tree (CAT) approach to mitigate wordline crosstalk using
adaptive trees of counters to guide appropriate refreshing of vulnerable rows.
The key idea is to tune the distribution of the counters to the rows in a bank
based on the memory reference patterns. In contrast to deterministic solutions,
CAT utilizes fewer counters, making it practically feasible to be implemented
on-chip. Compared to existing probabilistic approaches, CAT more precisely
refreshes rows vulnerable to crosstalk based on their access frequency.
  Experimental results on workloads from four benchmark suites show that CAT
reduces the Crosstalk Mitigation Refresh Power Overhead in quad-core systems to
7%, which is an improvement over the 21% and 18% incurred in the leading
deterministic and probabilistic approaches, respectively. Moreover, CAT incurs
very low performance overhead (0.5%). Hardware synthesis evaluation shows that
CAT can be implemented on-chip with only a nominal area overhead.

the underlying true reward, we derive an approach to infer a common reward

series of experiments that measure the sensitivity of these results to
different properties of the reward design task, such as the number of

multi-class classification problem is a class of important problem in machine
learning. However, in order to solve those types of multi-class classification
problems effectively, the required network size should have hyper-linear growth
with respect to the number of classes. Therefore, it is infeasible to solve the
multi-class classification problem using deep neural network when the number of
classes are huge. This paper presents a method, so called Label Mapping (LM),
to solve this problem by decomposing the original classification problem to
several smaller sub-problems which are solvable theoretically. Our method is an
ensemble method like error-correcting output codes (ECOC), but it allows base
learners to be multi-class classifiers with different number of class labels.
We propose two design principles for LM, one is to maximize the number of base
classifier which can separate two different classes, and the other is to keep
all base learners to be independent as possible in order to reduce the
redundant information. Based on these principles, two different LM algorithms
are derived using number theory and information theory. Since each base learner
can be trained independently, it is easy to scale our method into a large scale
training system. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms the
standard one-hot encoding and ECOC significantly in terms of accuracy and model
complexity.

synchronization barriers. We have custom-designed the batch sizing algorithm

It plays a similar role as the matrix nuclear norm which is the convex
surrogate of the matrix rank. Considering that the TNN based Tensor Robust PCA
[Lu et al., 2018a] is an elegant extension of Robust PCA with a similar tight
recovery bound, it is natural to solve other low rank tensor recovery problems
extended from the matrix cases. However, the extensions and proofs are
generally tedious. The general atomic norm provides a unified view of
low-complexity structures induced norms, e.g., the $\ell_1$-norm and nuclear
norm. The sharp estimates of the required number of generic measurements for
exact recovery based on the atomic norm are known in the literature. In this
work, with a careful choice of the atomic set, we prove that TNN is a special

necessary for the sharp estimate, we achieve a simple bound for guaranteed low

that by solving a TNN minimization problem, the underlying tensor of size

optimal when comparing with the degrees of freedom $r(n_1+n_2-r)n_3$. Beyond

the physics of inflation. Here we study the feasibility of measuring the
runnings when information from upcoming large-volume galaxy surveys is used to
supplement the information provided by a CMB-S4 experiment, particularly
focusing on the effect of including high-$k$, nonlinear scales. Since these
measurements will be sensitive to modeling uncertainties for the nonlinear
power spectrum, we examine how three different ways of parameterizing those
systematics---introducing zero, two, or several hundred nuisance
parameters---affect constraints and protect against parameter biases.
Considering statistical errors alone, we find that including strongly nonlinear
scales can substantially tighten constraints. However, these constraints weaken
to levels not much better than those from a CMB-S4 experiment alone when we
limit our analysis to scales where estimates are not strongly affected by
systematic biases. Given these considerations, near-future large-scale
structure surveys are unlikely to add much information to the CMB-S4
measurement of the first running $\alpha_s$. There is more potential for
improvement for the second running, $\beta_s$, for which large-scale structure
information will allow constraints to be improved by a factor of 3--4 relative
to using the CMB alone. Though these constraints are still above the value
predicted by slow roll inflation, they do probe regions of parameter space
relevant to nonstandard inflationary models with large runnings, for example
those that can generate an appreciable abundance of primordial black holes.

current rather than the net magnetization. The temperature robustness of the
FIM based THz emitter is also demonstrated. On the other hand, an AFM plays a
different role in THz emission. The IrMn/Pt bilayer shows negligible THz
signals, whereas Co/IrMn induces sizable THz outputs, indicating that IrMn is
not a good spin current generator, but a good detector. Our results not only
suggest that a compensated magnet can be utilized for robust THz emission, but
also provide a new approach to study the magnetization dynamics especially near
the magnetization compensation point.

this study is to investigate the adiabatic following dynamics in such

behaviour of stable cyclic (Floquet) states in the slow-driving limit. It is
found that the stable cyclic states can either behave as intuitively expected
by following instantaneous eigenstates, or exhibit piecewise adiabatic
following by sudden-switching between instantaneous eigenstates. We aim to
cover broad categories of non-Hermitian systems under a variety of different
driving scenarios. We systematically analyse the sudden-switch behaviour by a
universal route. That is, the sign change of the critical exponent in our
asymptotic analysis of the solutions is always found to be the underlying
mechanism to determine if the adiabatic following dynamics is trivial or
piecewise. This work thus considerably extends our early study on the same

we report herein a study of few-layer NbSe2 films, with a well-defined
single-domain orientation, epitaxially grown on Gallium Arsenide (GaAs).
Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) was used to determine the
electronic band structure and the Fermi surface as a function of layer
thickness; first-principles band structure calculations were performed for
comparison. The results show interesting changes as the film thickness
increases from a monolayer (ML) to several layers. The most notable changes
occur between a ML and a bilayer, where the inversion symmetry in bulk NbSe2 is
preserved in the bilayer but not in the ML. The results illustrate some basic
dimensional effects and provide a basis for further exploring and understanding

consider the locations of the sensors to be imperfectly known, which entails
that they represent another source of error in the model. The propagation model
includes shadowing which is considered to be a zero-mean Gaussian process where
the correlation of attenuation between two spatial points is quantified by an
exponential function of the distance between the points. The location of the
transmitter is also unknown and estimated from the data with a weighted
centroid approach. We propose to estimate time-varying RSS fields by a
recursive Bayesian method and crowdsourcing. The method is based on Gaussian
processes (GP), and it produces the joint distribution of the spatial field.
Further, it summarizes all the acquired information by keeping the size of the

processes, such as separation and dispersion in food industry, crystal
formation of pharmaceutical products, concentrating and analysis in medical

and numerical simulations, we \textit{quantitatively} study the dissolution
dynamics of femtoliter surface droplets in a highly ordered array under a
uniform flow. Our results show that the dissolution of femoliter droplets
strongly depends on their spatial positions relative to the flow direction,
drop-to-drop spacing in the array, and the imposed flow rate. In some
particular case, the droplet at the edge of the array can dissolve about 30%
faster than the ones located near the centre. The dissolution rate of the
droplet increases by 60% as the inter-droplet spacing is increased from 2.5
$\mu$m to 20 $\mu$m. Moreover, the droplets close to the front of flow commence
to shrink earlier than those droplets in the center of the array. The average
dissolution rate is faster for faster flow. As a result, the dissolution time
$T_{i}$ decreases with the Reynolds number Re of the flow as $T_{i}\propto
Re^{-3/4}$. The experimental results are in good agreement with numerical
simulations where the advection-diffusion equation for the concentration field
is solved and the concentration gradient on the surface of the drop is
computed. The findings suggest potential approaches to manipulate nanodroplet
sizes in droplet arrays simply by dissolution controlled by an external flow.
The obtained droplets with varying curvatures may serve as templates for
generating multifocal microlens in one array.

  Autoencoder",,,,,"cs.CE stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Identifying customer segments in retail banking portfolios with different
risk profiles can improve the accuracy of credit scoring. The Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) has shown promising results in different research domains,
and it has been documented the powerful information embedded in the latent
space of the VAE. We use the VAE and show that transforming the input data into
a meaningful representation, it is possible to steer configurations in the
latent space of the VAE. Specifically, the Weight of Evidence (WoE)
transformation encapsulates the propensity to fall into financial distress and
the latent space in the VAE preserves this characteristic in a well-defined
clustering structure. These clusters have considerably different risk profiles
and therefore are suitable not only for credit scoring but also for marketing
and customer purposes. This new clustering methodology offers solutions to some
of the challenges in the existing clustering algorithms, e.g., suggests the
number of clusters, assigns cluster labels to new customers, enables cluster
visualization, scales to large datasets, captures non-linear relationships
among others. Finally, for portfolios with a large number of customers in each
cluster, developing one classifier model per cluster can improve the credit
scoring assessment.

bosons interacting with contact interactions in one spatial dimension.
Crystallization is what happens for sufficiently strongly interacting repulsive
bosons with dipolar interactions in one spatial dimension. Crystallization and
fermionization resemble each other: in both cases -- due to their repulsion --
the bosons try to minimize their spatial overlap. We trace these two hallmark
phases of strongly correlated one-dimensional bosonic systems by exploring
their ground state properties using the one- and two-body density matrix. We
solve the $N$-body Schr\""odinger equation accurately and from first principles
using the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree for bosons (MCTDHB) and
for fermions (MCTDHF) methods. Using the one- and two-body density,
fermionization can be distinguished from crystallization in position space. For
$N$ interacting bosons, a splitting into an $N$-fold pattern in the one-body
and two-body density is a unique feature of both, fermionization and
crystallization. We demonstrate that the splitting is incomplete for
fermionized bosons and restricted by the confinement potential. This incomplete
splitting is a consequence of the convergence of the energy in the limit of
infinite repulsion and is in agreement with complementary results that we
obtain for fermions using MCTDHF. For crystalline bosons, in contrast, the
splitting is complete: the interaction energy is capable of overcoming the
confinement potential. Our results suggest that the spreading of the density as
a function of the dipolar interaction strength diverges as a power law. We
describe how to distinguish fermionization from crystallization experimentally
from measurements of the one- and two-body density.

estimation under different degrees of observability is studied. Observability
degree is the depth of the buses' reachability by the placed PMUs and thus
constitutes an important characteristic for PMU placement. However, the sole
observability as addressed in many works still does not guarantee a good
estimate for the grid state. Some existing works also considered the PMU
placement for minimizing the mean squared error or maximizing the mutual
information between the measurement output and grid state. However, they ignore
the observability requirements for computational tractability and thus
potentially lead to artificial results such as acceptance of the estimate for
an unobserved state component as its unconditional mean. In this work, the PMU
placement optimization problem is considered by minimizing the mean squared
error or maximizing the mutual information between the measurement output and
grid state, under grid observability constraints. The provided solution is free
from the mentioned fundamental drawbacks in the existing PMU placement designs.
The problems are posed as binary nonlinear optimization problems, for which
this paper develops efficient algorithms for computational solutions. The

classical configuration of spins (qubits). In contrast to the conventional
formulation, where one starts from a uniform superposition of all possible
states (classical configurations), quantum fluctuations are first increased and
only then decreased. One then reads out the state as a proposed solution to the
given combinatorial optimization problem. We formulate a mean-field theory of
reverse annealing using the fully-connected ferromagnetic $p$-spin model, with
and without random longitudinal fields, and analyze it in order to understand
how and when reverse annealing is effective at solving this problem. We find
that the difficulty arising from the existence of a first-order quantum phase
transition, which leads to an exponentially long computation time in
conventional quantum annealing, is circumvented in the context of this
particular problem by reverse annealing if the proximity of the initial state
to the (known) solution exceeds a threshold. Even when a first-order transition
is unavoidable, the difficulty is mitigated due to a smaller jump in the order
parameter at a first-order transition, which implies a larger rate of quantum
tunneling. This is the first analytical study of reverse annealing and paves
the way toward a systematic understanding of this relatively unexplored
protocol in a broader context.

are poorly described by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) when

excitations would require an exchange-correlation response differing
substantially from the usual (semi-)local one. It has recently been shown that
functionals of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) type can yield
unusual potentials, mimicking features of the exact exchange derivative
discontinuity and showing divergences on orbital nodal surfaces. We here
investigate whether these unusual potential properties translate into
beneficial response properties. Using the Sternheimer formalism we closely
investigate the response obtained with the 2013 exchange approximation by
Armiento and K\""ummel (AK13) and the 1988 exchange approximation by Becke
(B88), both of which show divergences on orbital nodal planes. Numerical
calculations for Na2 as well as analytical and numerical calculations for the
hydrogen atom show that the response of AK13 behaves qualitatively different
from usual semi local functionals. However, the AK13 functional leads to
fundamental instabilities in the asymptotic region that prevent its practical
application in TDDFT. Our findings may help the development of future improved
functionals, and corroborate that the frequency-dependent Sternheimer formalism
is excellently suited for running and analyzing TDDFT calculations.

from such mesas made of InP (which can be exchanged with AlGaInAs
lattice-matched to InP) for two cases: monolithic InP material or InP/AlGaInAs
distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) underneath the mesa. The calculations are

values above 20% can be obtained in the range of 60 nm around 1550 nm. When the

reachable within the proposed solution. The extraction efficiency is rather
weakly sensitive to the in-plane dipole alignment (in the range of 100-200 nm),

measuring the heat generated by a uniformly moving wire immersed in superfluid
$^3$He. We introduce the basis for the calculation of the drag force on a
macroscopic object using the Fermi-liquid theory of superfluidity. As a
technical tool in the calculations we propose a boundary condition that
describes diffuse reflection of quasiparticles from a surface on a scale that
is larger than the superfluid coherence length. We calculate the drag force on
steadily moving objects of different sizes. For an object that is small
compared to the coherence length, we find a drag force that is in accordance
with the expectation. For a macroscopic object we need to take into account the
spatially varying flow field around the object. At low velocities this arises
from ideal flow of the superfluid. At higher velocities the flow field is
modified by excitations that are created when the flow velocity locally exceeds
$v_L$. The flow field causes Andreev reflection of quasiparticles and thus
leads to change in the drag force. We calculate multiple limiting cases for a
cylinder-shaped object. In the absence of quasiparticle-quasiparticle
collisions we find that the critical velocity is larger than $v_L$ and the drag
force (per cross-sectional area) at $2v_L$ is reduced by an order of magnitude
compared to the case of a small object. In a collision-dominated limit the flow
shows signs of instability at a velocity below $v_L$.

second-order differential operators. These operators are termed shift
operators. In the flat space, they are intertwining operators which are closely
related to symmetry breaking differential operators. In the curved case, they
are closely connected with ideas of holography and the works of
Fefferman-Graham, Gover-Waldron and one of the authors. In particular, we
obtain an alternative description of the so-called residue families in
conformal geometry in terms of compositions of shift operators. This relation
allows easy new proofs of some of their basic properties. In addition, we
derive new holographic formulas for $Q$-curvatures in even dimension. Since
these turn out to be equivalent to earlier holographic formulas, the novelty
here is their conceptually very natural proof. The overall discussion leads to
a unification of constructions in representation theory and conformal geometry.

  Classification","Accepted at The Web Conference 2019 (WWW 2019). Please include WWW in
  any citations",,,,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Sentiment classification typically relies on a large amount of labeled data.
In practice, the availability of labels is highly imbalanced among different
languages, e.g., more English texts are labeled than texts in any other
languages, which creates a considerable inequality in the quality of related
information services received by users speaking different languages. To tackle
this problem, cross-lingual sentiment classification approaches aim to transfer
knowledge learned from one language that has abundant labeled examples (i.e.,
the source language, usually English) to another language with fewer labels
(i.e., the target language). The source and the target languages are usually
bridged through off-the-shelf machine translation tools. Through such a
channel, cross-language sentiment patterns can be successfully learned from
English and transferred into the target languages. This approach, however,
often fails to capture sentiment knowledge specific to the target language, and
thus compromises the accuracy of the downstream classification task. In this
paper, we employ emojis, which are widely available in many languages, as a new
channel to learn both the cross-language and the language-specific sentiment
patterns. We propose a novel representation learning method that uses emoji
prediction as an instrument to learn respective sentiment-aware representations
for each language. The learned representations are then integrated to
facilitate cross-lingual sentiment classification. The proposed method
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, which is
sustained even when sentiment labels are scarce.

in inversion symmetric WSe$_{2}$ and MoSe$_{2}$ bulk crystals to study this
spin-layer polarization and unveil its dynamics. Our measurements show that the
spin-layer relaxation time in WSe$_2$ is limited by phonon-scattering at high
temperatures and that the inter-layer hopping can be tunned by a small in-plane
magnetic field at low temperatures, enhancing the relaxation rates. We find a
significantly lower lifetime for MoSe$_{2}$ which agrees with theoretical

existing quadrangular bounding box based detectors are difficult to locate
texts with arbitrary shapes, which are hard to be enclosed perfectly in a
rectangle; 2) most pixel-wise segmentation-based detectors may not separate the
text instances that are very close to each other. To address these problems, we
propose a novel Progressive Scale Expansion Network (PSENet), designed as a
segmentation-based detector with multiple predictions for each text instance.
These predictions correspond to different `kernels' produced by shrinking the
original text instance into various scales. Consequently, the final detection
can be conducted through our progressive scale expansion algorithm which
gradually expands the kernels with minimal scales to the text instances with
maximal and complete shapes. Due to the fact that there are large geometrical
margins among these minimal kernels, our method is effective to distinguish the
adjacent text instances and is robust to arbitrary shapes. The state-of-the-art
results on ICDAR 2015 and ICDAR 2017 MLT benchmarks further confirm the great
effectiveness of PSENet. Notably, PSENet outperforms the previous best record
by absolute 6.37\% on the curve text dataset SCUT-CTW1500. Code will be

excess so that symmetry cannot be spontaneously broken. An archetypal way
around the no-go theorems is to augment interaction energy by increasing the
range of interaction. Here we introduce new ways around the no-go theorems by
investigating entropy depletion instead. We implement this for the Potts model
with invisible states.Because spins in such a state do not interact with their
surroundings, they contribute to the entropy but not the interaction energy of
the system. Reducing the number of invisible states to a negative value
decreases the entropy by an amount sufficient to induce a positive-temperature
classical phase transition. This approach is complementary to the long-range
interaction mechanism. Alternatively, subjecting positive numbers of invisible
states to imaginary or complex fields can trigger such a phase transition. We

of energy fluxes. Third, the selection of the solver for the radiative transfer

condensed matter systems and models of high-energy physics (HEP). They occur as
stable spin textures in certain planar magnetic materials and as configurations
in chiral nematic liquid crystals, having been originally proposed as model of
atomic nuclei. Since magnetic Skyrmions can be accelerated with a current, they
have the potential to encode bits in low-power magnetic storage devices.
Drawing on techniques from HEP, we demonstrate that magnetic and liquid crystal
Skyrmions interact like orientation dependent, localised particles, explaining
previously observed Skyrmion behaviour. This interaction motivates the
construction of Skyrmion bags: textures of high topological degree which we
realise experimentally in liquid crystals, and in magnetic materials by
computer simulations. These Skyrmion bags configurations are nested multiple
Skyrmions, which act like single Skyrmions in pairwise interaction, and under
the influence of a current in magnetic materials. These results emphasize
equivalent Skyrmion behaviour in different physical systems, and suggest new,
high-density magnetic memory storage devices based on Skyrmion bags.

have a significant degree of internal rotation. However, three-dimensional
kinematics from a combination of proper motions and line-of-sight velocities
are needed to unveil the role of angular momentum in the formation and
evolution of these old stellar systems. Here we present the first quantitative
study of internal rotation on the plane-of-the-sky for a large sample of
globular clusters using proper motions from Gaia DR2. We detect signatures of
rotation in the tangential component of proper motions for 11 out of 51
clusters at a $>$3-sigma confidence level, confirming the detection reported in
Gaia collaboration et al. (2018) for 8 clusters, and additionally identify 11
GCs with a 2-sigma rotation detection. For the clusters with a detected global
rotation, we construct the two-dimensional rotation maps and proper motion
rotation curves, and we assess the relevance of rotation with respect to random
motions ($V/\sigma\sim0.08-0.51$). We find evidence of a correlation between
the degree of internal rotation and relaxation time, highlighting the
importance of long-term dynamical evolution in shaping the clusters current
properties. This is a strong indication that angular momentum must have played
a fundamental role in the earliest phases of cluster formation. Finally,
exploiting the spatial information of the rotation maps and a comparison with
line-of-sight data, we provide an estimate of the inclination of the rotation
axis for a subset of 8 clusters. Our work demonstrates the potential of Gaia
data for internal kinematic studies of globular clusters and provides the first
step to reconstruct their intrinsic three-dimensional structure.

issue. For the general screened modified gravity (SMG), the post-Keplerian
parameters in the neutron star (NS) - white dwarf (WD) binaries differ from
those of general relativity (GR), and the differences are quantified by the
scalar charge $\epsilon_{\scriptscriptstyle\rm WD}$ of WD. After deriving the
constraints on $\epsilon_{\scriptscriptstyle\rm WD}$ from four different NS-WD
binaries, we find that $\epsilon_{\scriptscriptstyle\rm WD}$ is different from
zero at the 2$\sigma$ level in all the cases studied, and there exists an
inverse correlation between masses and scalar charges of low-mass WDs, which is
consistent with the screening mechanisms. In particular, two independent
binaries with measured radii of WDs follow the coincident constraints on the
vacuum expectation value of the scalar field. These self-consistent results
indicate that the observations in NS-WD binary pulsars seem in favor of SMG,
rather than GR.

  Stereo-SCIDAR is a technique specifically designed to characterise the
Earth's atmospheric turbulence with high altitude resolution and high
sensitivity. Together with ESO, Durham University has commissioned a
Stereo-SCIDAR instrument at Cerro Paranal, Chile, the site of the Very Large

Telescope (ELT).
  Here we provide results from the first 18 months of operation at ESO Paranal
including instrument comparisons and atmospheric statistics. Based on a sample
of 83 nights spread over 22 months covering all seasons, we find the median
seeing to be 0.64"" with 50% of the turbulence confined to an altitude below 2
km and 40% below 600 m. The median coherence time and isoplanatic angle are
found as 4.18 ms and 1.75"" respectively.
  A substantial campaign of inter-instrument comparison was also undertaken to
assure the validity of the data. The Stereo-SCIDAR profiles (optical turbulence
strength and velocity as a function of altitude) have been compared with the
Surface-Layer SLODAR, MASS-DIMM and the ECMWF weather forecast model. The

non-minimal couplings to the Ricci scalar and the Einstein tensor with

initially holds one of $k$ opinions. The goal is to eventually agree on the
initially dominant opinion. We consider an asynchronous communication model in
which each node is equipped with a random clock. Whenever the clock of a node
ticks, it may open communication channels to a constant number of other nodes,
chosen uniformly at random or from a list of constantly many addresses acquired
in previous steps. The tick rates and the delays for establishing communication
channels (channel delays) follow some probability distribution. Once a channel
is established, communication between nodes can be performed instantaneously.
  We consider distributions for the waiting times between ticks and channel
delays that have constant mean and the so-called positive aging property. In
this setting, asynchronous plurality consensus is fast: if the initial bias
between the largest and second largest opinion is at least $\sqrt{n}\log n$,
then after $O(\log\log_\alpha k\cdot\log k+\log\log n)$ time all but a $1/
\text{polylog } n$ fraction of nodes have the initial plurality opinion. Here
$\alpha$ denotes the initial ratio between the largest and second largest
opinion. After additional $O(\log n)$ steps all nodes have the same opinion
w.h.p., and this result is tight.
  If additionally the distributions satisfy a certain density property, which
is common in many well-known distributions, we show that consensus is reached
in $O(\log \log_\alpha k + \log \log n)$ time for all but $n/\text{polylog } n$
nodes, w.h.p. This implies that for a large range of initial configurations
partial consensus can be reached significantly faster in this asynchronous
communication model than in the synchronous setting.

  communication system with receive diversity",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the main problems in mobile communication systems is the degradation
of Radio Frequency (RF) connection when mobile user is far from base station.
One way to solve this problem is to increase the transmitter power, but the
mobile transmitter is not able to supply much power. Another way is to use a
relay; among relay schemes, amplify and forward is better for long range
communications. Amplify and forward relay is not affordable in terms of power
consumption and performance, because it consumes a lot of power inefficiently
and enhances the noise. Therefore, in other cases, except in the case of long
range links, other relay protocols, such as decode and forward, as well as
demodulate and forward, are preferable. In this paper, a novel multi-hop hybrid
Free Space Optical (FSO) / RF link is presented; it is made up of two main
parts. The first part establishes the connection between the mobile user and
source base station, and the second part establishes the connection between the
source and the destination base stations. In the first part, a mobile user
wants to connect to the source base station via a long range link; therefore, a
fixed gain amplify and forward relay with multiple receive antennas is used for
communication establishment. In the second part, the source and the destination
base stations are connected via a multi-hop hybrid parallel FSO / RF link with
demodulate and forward relaying. Considering the FSO link in Gamma-Gamma
atmospheric turbulence with the effect of pointing error in moderate to strong
regime and the Negative Exponential atmospheric turbulence in saturate regime,
and the RF link in Rayleigh fading, new closed form exact and asymptotic
expressions are derived for the Outage Probability and Bit Error Rate of the
proposed structure. Derived expressions are verified with MATLAB simulations.

learning algorithms, thereby providing a more nuanced view of the factors

recently used to study relations between the spin polarization and fluid
vorticity in systems consisting of spin-one-half particles. The thermodynamic
approach refers to general properties of global thermal equilibrium with a
rigid-like rotation and demonstrates that the spin-polarization and
thermal-vorticity tensors are equal. On the other hand, the kinetic approach
uses the concept of the Wigner function and its semi-classical expansion. In
most of the works done so far, the Wigner functions satisfy kinetic equations
with a vanishing collision term. We show that this assumption restricts
significantly applicability of such frameworks and, in contrast to many claims
found in the literature, does not allow for drawing any conclusions regarding
the relation between the thermal-vorticity and spin-polarization tensors,
except for the fact that the two should be constant in global equilibrium. We
further show how the kinetic-theory equations including spin degrees of freedom
can be used to formulate a hydrodynamic framework for particles with spin. We
define hydrodynamic equations starting separately from the formulation by
de~Groot, van~Leeuwen, and van~Weert and from the canonical formalism. In the
former case the energy-momentum tensor is symmetric and the spin tensor is
conserved, while in the later case the energy-momentum tensor is not symmetric
and the spin tensor is not conserved. Nevertheless, in the two cases the total
angular momentum is always conserved. Interestingly, the two approaches are
connected by the pseudo-gauge transformation, which we explicitly define.

Surprisingly, it turns out that the instability region of the {\gamma} Dor

stars should not be considered a separate class of variable. The observed red

analysis to incorporate local and global structure information into the
embedding. Besides, this model can be generalized to integrate network
information into other insufficiently trained embeddings at speed. Benefiting
from sparse spectral network embedding, our experiment on four different
datasets shows that Progle outperforms or is comparable to state-of-the-art
unsupervised comparison approaches---DeepWalk, LINE, node2vec, GraRep, and

due to physical and performance limitations, UWAC packets rarely include
encryption, leaving the UWAN exposed to external attacks faking legitimate
messages. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for message authentication
in a UWAN setting. We begin by observing that, due to the strong spatial
dependency of the underwater acoustic channel, an attacker can attempt to mimic
the channel associated with the legitimate transmitter only for a small set of
receivers, typically just for a single one. Taking this into account, our
scheme relies on trusted nodes that independently help a sink node in the
authentication process. For each incoming packet, the sink fuses beliefs
evaluated by the trusted nodes to reach an authentication decision. These
beliefs are based on estimated statistical channel parameters, chosen to be the
most sensitive to the transmitter-receiver displacement. Our simulation results
show accurate identification of an attacker's packet. We also report results
from a sea experiment demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

locate the nuclear system close to the unitary limit. This particular position
strongly constrains the low-energy observables in the three-nucleon system as
depending on one parameter, the triton binding energy, and introduces
correlations in the low energy sector of light nuclei. Here we analyze the
propagation of these correlations to infinite nuclear matter showing that its
saturation properties, the equation of state of $\beta$-stable nuclear matter
and several properties of neutron stars, as their maximum mass, are well
determined solely by a few number of low-energy quantities of the two- and

behavior observed in the low-energy region of few-nucleon systems and
fundamental properties of nuclear matter and neutron stars.

need for strong, emotionally intense relationships and a diversity of weaker
ties. Egocentric network structure can be quantified with 'social signatures',
which describe how people distribute their communication effort across the
members (alters) of their personal networks. Social signatures based on call
data have indicated that people mostly communicate with a few close alters;
they also have persistent, distinct signatures. To examine if these results
hold for other channels of communication, here we compare social signatures
built from call and text message data, and develop a way of constructing mixed
social signatures using both channels. We observe that all types of signatures
display persistent individual differences that remain stable despite the
turnover in individual alters. We also show that call, text, and mixed
signatures resemble one another both at the population level and at the level
of individuals. The consistency of social signatures across individuals for
different channels of communication is surprising because the choice of channel
appears to be alter-specific with no clear overall pattern, and ego networks
constructed from calls and texts overlap only partially in terms of alters.
These results demonstrate individuals vary in how they allocate their
communication effort across their personal networks and this variation is
persistent over time and across different channels of communication.

using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) generate checkerboard artifacts. A
condition to avoid the checkerboard artifacts is proposed in this paper. So
far, checkerboard artifacts have been mainly studied for linear multirate
systems, but the condition to avoid checkerboard artifacts can not be applied
to CNNs due to the non-linearity of CNNs. We extend the avoiding condition for
CNNs, and apply the proposed structure to some typical SR methods to confirm
the effectiveness of the new scheme. Experiment results demonstrate that the
proposed structure can perfectly avoid to generate checkerboard artifacts under
two loss conditions: mean square error and perceptual loss, while keeping
excellent properties that the SR methods have.

about the class, like a textual description or a set of attributes. Learning
from attributes could benefit from explicitly modeling structure of the
attribute space. Unfortunately, learning of general structure from empirical
samples is hard with typical dataset sizes.
  Here we describe LAGO, a probabilistic model designed to capture natural soft
and-or relations across groups of attributes. We show how this model can be
learned end-to-end with a deep attribute-detection model. The soft group
structure can be learned from data jointly as part of the model, and can also
readily incorporate prior knowledge about groups if available. The soft and-or
structure succeeds to capture meaningful and predictive structures, improving
the accuracy of zero-shot learning on two of three benchmarks.
  Finally, LAGO reveals a unified formulation over two ZSL approaches: DAP
(Lampert et al., 2009) and ESZSL (Romera-Paredes & Torr, 2015). Interestingly,
taking only one singleton group for each attribute, introduces a new
soft-relaxation of DAP, that outperforms DAP by ~40.

a novel approach to ownership that remains highly programmable.
  In this talk, we will describe our ongoing work on designing a formal
semantics for Rust that captures ownership and borrowing without the details of
lifetime analysis. This semantics models a high-level understanding of
ownership and as a result is close to source-level Rust (but with full type
annotations) which differs from the recent RustBelt effort that essentially
models MIR, a CPS-style IR used in the Rust compiler. Further, while RustBelt
aims to verify the safety of unsafe code in Rust's standard library, we model
standard library APIs as primitives, which is sufficient to reason about their
behavior. This yields a simpler model of Rust and its type system that we think
researchers will find easier to use as a starting point for investigating Rust
extensions. Unlike RustBelt, we aim to prove type soundness using progress and
preservation instead of a Kripke logical relation. Finally, our semantics is a
family of languages of increasing expressive power, where subsequent levels
have features that are impossible to define in previous levels. Following
Felleisen, expressive power is defined in terms of observational equivalence.
Separating the language into different levels of expressive power should
provide a framework for future work on Rust verification and compiler
optimization.

function has Lipschitz continuous gradient, which is not necessary for the
other approaches. Convergence of the whole sequence to a minimizer, without any
level set boundedness assumption, is proved. Iteration-complexity bound for
functions with Lipschitz continuous gradient is also presented. Numerical
experiments are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the method in this
new setting and certify the obtained theoretical results. In particular, we
consider the problem of finding the Riemannian center of mass and the so-called
Karcher's mean. Our numerical experiences indicate that the adaptive stepsize
is a promising scheme that is worth considering.

theoretical particle physics. The main part shows measurements of
$\ell^+\ell^-\ell'^+\ell'^-$ production (where $\ell$, $\ell'$ is either an
electron or a muon) in proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV centre-of-mass
energy. The collisions were produced by the Large Hadron Collider in 2015 and
2016 and observed with the ATLAS detector. In a phase space sensitive to Z
boson pair production, the integrated cross section as well as differential
cross sections with respect to twenty-one observables are measured. Ten of
these directly measure associated jet activity. The measurements provide an
important test of the Standard Model of particle physics. A direct search for
effects beyond the Standard Model affecting ZZ production is performed in a
generic effective field theory approach. No significant deviations from the
Standard Model predictions are observed. Exclusion limits are set on the
parameters describing new physics in the effective field theory. In theoretical
developments, the automated description of loop-induced processes with the
Herwig 7 event generator is presented. These are processes that can only occur
via a quantum loop of virtual particles. Preliminary results in leading-order
quantum chromodynamics are shown for the production of a Higgs boson, of a pair
of Higgs bosons, and of four leptons. The Higgs boson results show that the
full loop-induced description can deviate significantly from the common
approximation where the mass of the top quark is treated as infinitely large.
Thus, including loop effects is crucial to obtaining precise predictions to
compare to measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. Developments towards a
next-to-leading-order description of arbitrary loop-induced processes are
shown.

in understanding problems associated with the perturbative theory of quantum

locking up to 10--20% of the elemental carbon. Sequential fragmentation induced
by energetic photons leads to the formation of new species, including
fullerenes. However, the exact chemical routes involved in this process remain
largely unexplored. In this work, we focus on the first photofragmentation
steps, which involve the dehydrogenation of these molecules. For this, we
consider a multidisciplinary approach, taking into account the results from
experiments, DFT calculations, and modeling using dedicated Monte-Carlo
simulations. By considering the simplest isomerization pathways --- i.e.,
hydrogen roaming along the edges of the molecule --- we are able to
characterize the most likely photodissociation pathways for the molecules
studied here. These comprise nine PAHs with clearly different structural
properties. The formation of aliphatic-like side groups is found to be critical
in the first fragmentation step and, furthermore, sets the balance of the
competition between H- and H2-loss. We show that the presence of trio
hydrogens, especially in combination with bay regions in small PAHs plays an
important part in the experimentally established variations in the odd-to-even
H-atom loss ratios. In addition, we find that, as PAH size increases, H2
formation becomes dominant, and sequential hydrogen loss only plays a marginal
role. We also find disagreements between experiments and calculations for
large, solo containing PAHs, which need to be accounted for. In order to match
theoretical and experimental results, we have modified the energy barriers and
restricted the H-hopping to tertiary atoms. The formation of H2 in large PAHs
upon irradiation appears to be the dominant fragmentation channel, suggesting
an efficient formation path for molecular hydrogen in PDRs.

mainly focus on situations where all the objectives are fully conflicting with
each other. In such cases, an m-objective optimisation problem has an
(m-1)-dimensional Pareto front in the objective space. However, in some
optimisation problems, there may be unexpected characteristics among

multiobjective problem having a degenerate Pareto front, i.e., the dimension of
the Pareto front of the $m$-objective problem be less than (m-1). In this
paper, we systematically study degenerate multiobjective problems. We abstract
three general characteristics of degenerate problems, which are not formulated
and systematically investigated in the literature. Based on these
characteristics, we present a set of test problems to support the investigation
of multiobjective optimisation algorithms under situations with redundant

explicitly formulates these three characteristics of degenerate problems, thus
allowing the resulting test problems to be featured by their generality, in

largely determined by the influence of far ultraviolet radiation. Far-UV
photons can efficiently dissociate molecular hydrogen, a process that must be
balanced at the HI/H2 interface of the PDR. Given that reactions involving
hydrogen atoms in the gas phase are highly inefficient under interstellar
conditions, H2 formation models mostly rely on catalytic reactions on the
surface of dust grains. Additionally, molecular hydrogen formation in
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) through the Eley-Rideal mechanism has
been considered as well, although it has been found to have low efficiency in
PDR fronts. In a previous work, we have described the possibility of efficient
H2 release from medium to large sized PAHs upon photodissociation, with the
exact branching between H-/H2-loss reactions being molecule dependent. Here we
investigate the astrophysical relevance of this process, by using a model for
the photofragmentation of PAHs under interstellar conditions. We focus on three
PAHs cations (coronene, ovalene and circumcoronene), which represent three
possibilities in the branching of atomic and molecular hydrogen losses. We find
that, for ovalene (H2-loss dominated) the rate coefficient for H2 formation
reaches values of the same order as H2 formation in dust grains. This result
suggests that this hitherto disregarded mechanism can account, at least partly,
for the high level of molecular hydrogen formation in dense PDRs.

  accounting for phonon dispersion and polarization","24 pages and 21 figures",,,,"physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An efficient implicit kinetic scheme is developed to solve the stationary
phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) based on the non-gray model including
the phonon dispersion and polarization. Due to the wide range of the dispersed
phonon mean free paths, the phonon transport under the non-gray model is
essentially multiscale, and has to be solved differently and appropriately for
varied phonon frequencies and branches. The proposed implicit kinetic scheme is
composed of a microscopic iteration and a macroscopic iteration. The
microscopic iteration is capable of automatically adapting with varied phonon
mean free path of each phonon frequency and branch through solving the phonon
BTE. The energy transfer of all phonons is gathered together by the microscopic
iteration to evaluate the heat flux. The temperature field is predicted through
a macroscopic heat transfer equation according to the heat flux, and the
equilibrium state in the phonon BTE is also updated. The combination of the
phonon BTE solver and the macroscopic equation makes the present method very
efficient in a wide length scale. Three numerical tests, including the
cross-plane, in-plane and nano-porous heat transfer in silicon, validate that
the present scheme can handle with the phonon dispersion and polarization
correctly and predict the multiscale heat transfer phenomena efficiently in a
wide range. The present method could be tens of times faster than the typical
implicit DOM and keeps the same amount of the memory requirements as the
Fourier solver for multiscale heat transfer problem.

alignment-free techniques, which are based on measures referring to the
composition of sequences in terms of their constituent patterns. These
measures, such as $q$-gram distance, are usually computed in time linear with
respect to the length of the sequences. In this paper, we focus on the
complementary idea: how two sequences can be efficiently compared based on
information that does not occur in the sequences. A word is an {\em absent
word} of some sequence if it does not occur in the sequence. An absent word is
{\em minimal} if all its proper factors occur in the sequence. Here we present
the first linear-time and linear-space algorithm to compare two sequences by
considering {\em all} their minimal absent words. In the process, we present
results of combinatorial interest, and also extend the proposed techniques to
compare circular sequences. We also present an algorithm that, given a word $x$
of length $n$, computes the largest integer for which all factors of $x$ of
that length occur in some minimal absent word of $x$ in time and space
$\cO(n)$. Finally, we show that the known asymptotic upper bound on the number

show a highly improved polarization coverage and resolution compared to earlier
100 $\mu$m observations. The 850 $\mu$m data have a resolution and coverage
similar to previous 350 $\mu$m polarimetry data. However, with a proper
sampling on a 10$""$ grid, we find the 850 $\mu$m data trace the morphological
structures of the CND substantially better. Furthermore, because the 850 $\mu$m
trace the field deeper into the material near Sgr A*, they represent the
highest resolution submillimeter probe to date of the CND magnetic field. The
observed $B$-field morphology is well described by a self-similar axisymmetric
disk model where the radial infall velocity is one quarter of the rotational
velocity. A detailed comparison with higher-resolution interferometric maps
from the Submillimeter Array further reveals that the $B$-field aligns with the
neutral gas streamers connecting to the CND. Moreover, the innermost observed
$B$-field structure also appears to trace and align with the mini-spiral
located inside the CND. This suggests that there is one underlying $B$-field
structure that is connecting the CND with its streamers and the inner
mini-spiral. An estimate of $\beta_{\rm Plasma} \lesssim 1-$based on the global
B-field morphology that constrains the azimuthal-to-vertical field strength
ratio of around 40 combined with a measurement of the azimuthal

thermal management of nanoscale devices of graphene and other 2D materials.
Previous attempts to search for metal contacts with high thermal conductance
yielded limited success due to incomplete understanding of the origins of the
low thermal conductance. In this paper, we carefully study the intrinsic
thermal conductance across metal/graphene/metal interfaces to identify the heat
transport mechanisms across graphene interfaces. We find that unlike metal
contacts on diamond, the intrinsic thermal conductance of most graphene
interfaces (except Ti and TiNx) is only about 50 % of the phonon radiation
limit, suggesting that heat is carried across graphene interfaces mainly
through elastic transmission of phonons. We thus propose a convenient approach
to substantially enhance the phononic heat transport across metal contacts on
graphene, by better matching the energy of phonons in metals and graphene,
e.g., using metallic nitrides. We test the idea with TiNx, with phonon
frequencies of up to 1.18*10^14 rad/s, 47 % of the highest phonon frequencies
in graphene of 2.51*10^14 rad/s . Interestingly, we obtain a huge thermal
conductance of 270 MW m-2 K-1 for TiNx/graphene interfaces, which is about 140
% of the phonon radiation limit. The huge thermal conductance could be
partially attributed to inelastic phonon transport across the TiNx/graphene
interface. Our work provides guidance for the search for good metal contacts on
2D materials and devices.

doubly challenging: it is difficult to collect enough annotated data to enable
learning of this reasoning process from scratch, and also difficult to

an approach to vision-and-language navigation that addresses both these issues
with an embedded speaker model. We use this speaker model to (1) synthesize new
instructions for data augmentation and to (2) implement pragmatic reasoning,
which evaluates how well candidate action sequences explain an instruction.
Both steps are supported by a panoramic action space that reflects the
granularity of human-generated instructions. Experiments show that all three

altitude of a DSC has a huge impact on the performance of downlink, the
downlink interference control problem is mapped to an altitude control problem
in this paper. All DSCs adjust their altitude to improve the available
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The control problem is modeled
as a mean-field game (MFG), where the cost function is designed to combine the
available SINR with the cost of altitude controling. The interference
introduced from a big amount of DSCs is derived through a mean-field
approximation approach. Within the proposed MFG framework, the related
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations are deduced to
describe and explain the control policy. The optimal altitude control policy is
obtained by solving the partial differential equations with a proposed finite
difference algorithm based on the upwind scheme. The simulations illustrate the
optimal power controls and corresponding mean field distribution of DSCs. The
numerical results also validate that the proposed control policy achieves
better SINR performance of DSCs compared to the uniform control scheme.

is commonly outflowing at speeds of several hundred km$\,\textrm{s}^{-1}$. This
observational fact poses a severe challenge to our theoretical models of galaxy
evolution since most feedback mechanisms (e.g., supernovae feedback) accelerate
hot gas, and the timescale it takes to accelerate a blob of cold gas via a hot
wind is much larger than the time it takes to destroy the blob. We revisit this
long-standing problem using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with
radiative cooling. Our results confirm previous findings, that cooling is often
not efficient enough to prevent the destruction of cold gas. However, we also
identify regions of parameter space where the cooling efficiency of the mixed,
`warm' gas is sufficiently large to contribute new comoving cold gas which can
significantly exceed the original cold gas mass. This happens whenever,
$t_{\mathrm{cool, mix}}/t_{\mathrm{cc}} < 1$, where $t_{\mathrm{cool,mix}}$ is
the cooling time of the mixed warm gas and $t_{\mathrm{cc}}$ is the
cloud-crushing time. This criterion is always satisfied for a large enough
cloud. Cooling `focuses' stripped material onto the tail where mixing takes
place and new cold gas forms. A sufficiently large simulation domain is crucial
to capturing this behavior.

tissue components may be confounded by non-diffusion properties such as T2
relaxation. Third, the domain of validity for the estimated parameters to serve
as indices of neurite density is incompletely explored. We investigated these
challenges by acquiring data with 'b-tensor encoding' and multiple echo times
in both healthy brain and white matter lesions. Results showed that microscopic
anisotropy from b-tensor data is associated with myelinated axons but not with
dendrites. Furthermore, b-tensor and multi-echo data showed that unbiased
density estimates in white matter lesions require data-driven estimates of
compartment-specific T2 times. Finally, the 'stick' fractions of different
biophysical models could generally not serve as neurite density indices across
the healthy brain and white matter lesions, where outcomes of comparisons
depended on the choice of constraints. In particular, constraining
compartment-specific T2 times was ambiguous in the healthy brain and had a
large impact on estimated values. In summary, estimating neurite density may
require accounting for different diffusion and/or T2 properties between axons
and dendrites. Constrained 'index' parameters could be valid within limited
domains that should be delineated by future studies.

a difficult task due to the large differences in crystallization energy between
these types of materials. This aspect is problematic in the context of
spintronics, where coherent spin-injection must proceed via ballistic transport
through sharp interfacial Schottky barriers. We report the realization of
single-crystalline ferromagnet/semiconductor/ferromagnet hybrid trilayers using
solid-phase epitaxy, with combinations of Fe3Si, Co2FeSi, and Ge. The slow
annealing of amorphous Ge over Fe3Si results in a crystalline filmlm identified
as FeGe2. When the annealing is performed over Co2FeSi, reflected high-energy
electron diffraction and X-ray diffraction indicate the creation of a different
crystalline Ge(Co,Fe,Si) compound, which also preserves growth orientation. It
was possible to observe independent magnetization switching of the
ferromagnetic layers in a Fe3Si/FeGe2/Co2FeSi sample, thanks to the different
coercive fields of the two metals and to the quality of the interfaces. This
result is a step towards the implementation of vertical spin-selective
transistor-like devices.

that there exist non-zero column vectors $x_v\in\mathbb{C}^\xi$ for $v\in V$
satisfying the orthogonality condition $x_v^\dagger x_w=0$ for all $vw\in E$.
We prove that many spectral lower bounds for the chromatic number, $\chi$, are
also lower bounds for $\xi$. This result complements a previous result by the
authors, in which they showed that spectral lower bounds for $\chi$ are also
lower bounds for the quantum chromatic number $\chi_q$. It is known that the
quantum chromatic number and the orthogonal rank are incomparable.
  We conclude by proving an inertial lower bound for the projective rank
$\xi_f$, and conjecture that a stronger inertial lower bound for $\xi$ is also
a lower bound for $\xi_f$.

different diameter are considered. Different defects are exemplarily
represented by monovacancies and divacancies. We show the energy-dependent
transmission and the temperature-dependent conductance as a function of the
number of defects. In the limit of many defetcs, the transport is described by
strong localization. Corresponding localization lengths are calculated (energy
dependent and temperature dependent) and systematically compared for a large
number of CNTs. It is shown, that a distinction by $(m-n)\,\mathrm{mod}\,3$ has
to be drawn in order to classify CNTs with different bandgaps. Besides this,
the localization length for a given defect probability per unit cell depends
linearly on the CNT diameter, but not on the CNT chirality. Finally, elastic
mean free paths in the diffusive regime are computed for the limit of few
defects, yielding qualitatively same statements.

of the perception of space from a fundamental sensorimotor perspective. Despite
its pervasive nature in our perception of the world, the origin of the concept
of space remains largely mysterious. For example in the context of artificial
perception, this issue is usually circumvented by having engineers pre-define
the spatial structure of the problem the agent has to face. We here show that
the structure of space can be autonomously discovered by a naive agent in the
form of sensorimotor regularities, that correspond to so called compensable
sensory experiences: these are experiences that can be generated either by the
agent or its environment. By detecting such compensable experiences the agent
can infer the topological and metric structure of the external space in which
its body is moving. We propose a theoretical description of the nature of these
regularities and illustrate the approach on a simulated robotic arm equipped
with an eye-like sensor, and which interacts with an object. Finally we show
how these regularities can be used to build an internal representation of the
sensor's external spatial configuration.

outlines the implementation of a convex algorithm statistical image
reconstruction framework applicable to the geometry of most neutron tomography
instruments with the aim of obtaining similar imaging quality to conventional
ramp filtered back-projection via the inverse Radon transform, but using a
lower number of measured projections to increase object throughput. Through
comparison of the output of these two frameworks using a tomographic scan of a
known 3 material cylindrical phantom obtain with the DINGO neutron radiography
instrument (ANSTO, Australia), this work illustrates the advantages of
statistical image reconstruction techniques over conventional filter
back-projection. It was found that the statistical image reconstruction
framework was capable of obtaining image estimates of similar quality with
respect to filtered back-projection using only 12.5% the number of projections,
potentially increasing object throughput at neutron imaging facilities such as
DINGO eight-fold.

digital libraries, which is particularly challenging on large and diverse

refer only to the relevance of particular subjects, disregarding indicators of
insufficient content representation at the document-level. Therefore, we
propose a novel approach that detects documents rather than concepts where
quality criteria are met. Our approach uses a deep, multi-layered regression
architecture, which comprises a variety of content-based indicators. We
evaluated multiple configurations using text collections from law and
economics, where the available content is restricted to very short texts.
Notably, we demonstrate that the proposed quality estimation technique can
determine subsets of the previously unseen data where considerable gains in
document-level recall can be achieved, while upholding precision at the same
time. Hence, the approach effectively performs a filtering that ensures high
data quality standards in operative information retrieval systems.

discovery of General Relativity (GR). It is intended for students learning GR
or specialist that will find new lights and connexions on these historic
derivations. Since 1915, it is well known that the observed light bending stems
from two contributions : the first one is directly deduced from the equivalence
principle alone and was obtained by Einstein in 1911; the second one comes from
the spatial curvature of spacetime. In GR, those two components are equal, but
other relativistic theories of gravitation can give different values to those
contributions. In this paper, we give a simple explanation, based on the
wave-particle picture of why the first term, which relies on the equivalence
principle, is identical to the one obtained by a purely Newtonian analysis. In
this context of wave analysis, we emphasize that the dependency of the velocity
of light with the gravitational potential, as deduced by Einstein concerns the
phase velocity. Then, we wonder whether Einstein could have envisaged already
in 1911 the second contribution, and therefore the correct result. We argue
that considering a length contraction in the radial direction, along with the
time dilation implied by the equivalence principle, could have led Einstein to
the correct result.

Riemann solver for cheap and accurate computation of high speed gasdynamical
flows. Unfortunately this scheme is known to be plagued by various forms of
numerical shock instability. In this paper we present various strategies to
save the HLLEM scheme from developing such spurious solutions. A linear scale
analysis of its mass and interface-normal momentum flux discretizations reveal
that its antidiffusive terms, which are primarily responsible for resolution of
linear wavefields, are inadvertently activated along a normal shock front due
to numerical perturbations. These erroneously activated terms counteract the
favourable damping mechanism provided by its inherent HLL-type diffusive terms
and trigger the shock instability. To avoid this, two different strategies are
proposed for discretization of these critical flux components in the vicinity
of a shock: one that deals with increasing the magnitude of inherent HLL-type
dissipation through careful manipulation of specific non-linear wave speed
estimates while the other deals with reducing the magnitude of these critical
antidiffusive terms. A linear perturbation analysis is performed to gauge the
effectiveness of these cures and estimate von-Neumann type stability bounds on
the CFL number arising from their use. Results from classic numerical test
cases show that both types of modified HLLEM schemes are able to provide
excellent shock stable solutions while retaining commendable accuracy on shear
dominated viscous flows.

  measures","Preprint paper to appear in Network Science journal, Cambridge
  University Press",,,,"cs.SI cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recently developed bag-of-paths (BoP) framework consists in setting a
Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution on all feasible paths of a graph. This probability
distribution favors short paths over long ones, with a free parameter (the
temperature $T$) controlling the entropic level of the distribution. This
formalism enables the computation of new distances or dissimilarities,
interpolating between the shortest-path and the resistance distance, which have
been shown to perform well in clustering and classification tasks. In this
work, the bag-of-paths formalism is extended by adding two independent equality
constraints fixing starting and ending nodes distributions of paths (margins).
When the temperature is low, this formalism is shown to be equivalent to a
relaxation of the optimal transport problem on a network where paths carry a
flow between two discrete distributions on nodes. The randomization is achieved
by considering free energy minimization instead of traditional cost
minimization. Algorithms computing the optimal free energy solution are
developed for two types of paths: hitting (or absorbing) paths and non-hitting,
regular, paths, and require the inversion of an $n \times n$ matrix with $n$
being the number of nodes. Interestingly, for regular paths on an undirected
graph, the resulting optimal policy interpolates between the deterministic
optimal transport policy ($T \rightarrow 0^{+}$) and the solution to the
corresponding electrical circuit ($T \rightarrow \infty$). Two distance
measures between nodes and a dissimilarity between groups of nodes, both

combining X-ray micro tomography (XMT) with scanning electron microscope (SEM)
based image analysis additional information about the mineralogical composition
from certain planar sections can be gained. For the analysis of tomographic
images of particle systems the extraction of single particles is essential.
This is performed with a marker-based watershed algorithm and a post-processing
step utilizing a neural network to reduce oversegmentation. The results are
validated by comparing the 3D particle-wise segmentation empirically with 2D
SEM images which have been obtained with a different imaging process and
segmentation algorithm. Finally, a stereological application is shown, in which
planar SEM images are embedded into the tomographic 3D image. This allows the
estimation of local X-ray attenuation coefficients, which are material-specific
quantities, in the entire tomographic image.

spread of infectious diseases, such as public vaccination of asymptomatic
individuals, quarantine (isolation) and treatment of symptomatic individuals.
Epidemic models have a long history of assisting in public health planning and
policy making. In this paper, we introduce epidemic models including variable
population size, degree-related imperfect vaccination and quarantine on
scale-free networks. More specifically, the models are formulated both on the
population with and without permanent natural immunity to infection, which
corresponds respectively to the
susceptible-vaccinated-infected-quarantined-recovered (SVIQR) model and the
susceptible-vaccinated-infected-quarantined (SVIQS) model. We develop different
mathematical methods and techniques to study the dynamics of two models,
including the basic reproduction number, the global stability of disease-free
and endemic equilibria. For the SVIQR model, we show that the system exhibits a
forward bifurcation. Meanwhile, the disease-free and unique endemic equilibria
are shown to be globally asymptotically stable by constructing suitable
Lyapunov functions. For the SVIQS model, conditions ensuring the occurrence of
multiple endemic equilibria are derived. Under certain conditions, this system
cannot undergo a backward bifurcation. The global asymptotical stability of
disease-free equilibrium, and the persistence of the disease are proved. The
endemic equilibrium is shown to be globally attractive by using monotone
iterative technique. Finally, stochastic network simulations yield quantitative
agreement with the deterministic mean-field approach.

There are though some problems with this solid-state type of model beyond the

little-known property of these networks: although the value of the
assortativity coefficient is close to zero, they look disassortative if one
considers only a bounded range of degrees, including the smallest ones, and
slightly assortative on the range of the higher degrees. We also find that if
the trickle-down character of the diffusion process is enhanced by a larger
initial stimulus on the hubs (via a inhomogeneous linear term in the Bass
model), the relative difference between the diffusion times for BA networks and
uncorrelated networks is even larger, reaching for instance the 34% in a
