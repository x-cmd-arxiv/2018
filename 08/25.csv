crucial component is a multiplicative noise term of the voter model type in the
dynamics of the local polarization whose magnitude is inversely proportional to
the local density. We show that there is an important subtlety in determining
the physically appropriate noise, in that it depends on a careful choice of the

fresh decomposition approach, orthogonal to existing methods, that explores the
decomposition of the specification into separate input and output components.
We make use of an input-output decomposition of a given specification described
as a CNF formula, by alternatingly analyzing the separate input and output
components. We exploit well-defined properties of these components to
ultimately synthesize a solution for the entire specification. We first provide
a theoretical result that, for input components with specific structures,
synthesis for CNF formulas via this framework can be performed more efficiently

algorithm performs well also in practice on instances which are challenging for
existing state-of-the-art tools, serving as a good complement to modern

node similarity, graphlet-orbit transitions (GoTs). Here, we use GoTs instead
of DGDVs as a new dynamic NC measure within DynaWAVE, resulting in a new

  On synthetic networks, GoT-WAVE improves DynaWAVE's accuracy by 25% and speed
by 64%. On real networks, when optimizing only dynamic NC, each method is
superior ~50% of the time. While DynaWAVE benefits more from also optimizing
dynamic EC, only GoT-WAVE can support directed edges. Hence, GoT-WAVE is a
promising new temporal GPNA algorithm, which efficiently optimizes dynamic NC.

this modulated phase is related to the more exhaustively studied pseudogap and

energy scale $\Delta_{CDW}$ associated with the charge modulations, and to
compare it with the pseudogap (PG) $\Delta_{PG}$ and the superconducting gap

dependence of $\Delta_{PG}$ and $\Delta_{SC}$. This shows that CDW is an
unconventional order, and that the above three phases are controlled by the

\Delta_{SC}$ over a substantial doping range, which is suggestive of an
approximate emergent symmetry connecting the charge modulated phase with

coverage probabilities that greatly exceed the nominal confidence level. There
are, however, many applications where the resampling bootstrap method cannot be
used. These include situations where the data are heavily censored, logistic
regression when the success response is a rare event or where there is
insufficient mixing of successes and failures across the explanatory

prove that pointwise convergence of a sequence of $F$-norms to an $F$-norm is
equivalent to convergence of the pertaining distribution functions in the
Wasserstein metric. On the statistical side, an $F$-norm can easily be
estimated by an empirical $F$-norm, whose consistency and weak convergence we
establish.
  The concept of $F$-norms can be extended to arbitrary random vectors under
suitable integrability conditions fulfilled by, for instance, normal
distributions. The set of $F$-norms is endowed with a semigroup operation
which, in this context, corresponds to ordinary convolution of the underlying
distributions. Limiting results such as the central limit theorem can then be
formulated in terms of pointwise convergence of products of $F$-norms.
  We conclude by showing how, using the geometry of $F$-norms, we may
characterize nonnegative integrable distributions in $\mathbb{R}^d$ by simple
compact sets in $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$. We then relate convergence of those

events recognized by different ubiquitous systems and derive actionable causal
relationships from an event ledger. Understanding of user habits and health

potential of Epelbaum, Krebs, and Mei{\ss}ner (EKM). There are many NN
scattering data, up to high energies, and with rather small errors, so imposing
a penalty for unnatural low-energy constants (LECs) usually has a small effect
on the fits. In contrast, we have found that including an estimate of higher
orders in $\chi$EFT plays an important role in robust parameter estimation.We
present two case studies where our Bayesian machinery illuminates physics
issues. The first involves the EKM potential at fourth order in the $\chi$EFT
expansion: the two-dimensional posterior probability density function (pdf) for
the fourth-order $s$-wave LECs obtained from the Nijmegen PWA93 phase shifts
indicates these parameters in the NN potential are degenerate. We trace this
feature of the pdf to the presence of an operator in the fourth-order NN
potential that vanishes on-shell. The second case study examines the stability
of LEC extractions as more data at higher energies are included in the fit. We
show that as long as $\chi$EFT truncation errors are properly accounted for in
the parameter estimation, the LEC values extracted using our Bayesian approach
are not sensitive to the maximum energy chosen for the fit.Uncorrelated and
fully correlated models for the truncation errors are compared, pointing the
way to the use of Gaussian processes to more generally model the correlation

driven over random pinning. For weak pinning, the skyrmions depin elastically,
retaining sixfold ordering; however, at the onset of motion there is a dip in
the magnitude of the structure factor peaks due to a decrease in positional
ordering, indicating that the depinning transition can be detected using the
structure factor even within the elastic depinning regime. At higher drives the
moving skyrmion lattice regains full ordering. For increasing pinning strength,
we find a transition from elastic to plastic depinning that is accompanied by a
sharp increase in the depinning threshold due to the proliferation of
topological defects, similar to the peak effect found at the elastic to plastic
depinning transition in superconducting vortex systems. For strong pinning and
strong Magnus force, the skyrmions in the moving phase can form a strongly
clustered or phase separated state with highly modulated skyrmion density,
similar to that recently observed in continuum-based simulations for strong
disorder. As the Magnus force is decreased, the density phase separated state
crosses over to a dynamically phase separated state with uniform density but
with flow localized in bands of motion, while in the strongly damped limit,
both types of phase separated states are lost. In the strong pinning limit, we
find highly nonlinear velocity-force curves in the transverse and longitudinal
directions, along with distinct regions of negative differential conductivity
in the plastic flow regime. The negative differential conductivity is absent in
the overdamped limit. The Magnus force is responsible for both the negative
differential conductivity and the clustering effects, since it causes faster
moving skyrmions to partially rotate around slower moving or pinned skyrmions.

solutions) or entropy stable (for discontinuous solutions) space-time
discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for systems of non-linear hyperbolic
conservation laws. The resulting numerical scheme is fully discrete and
provides a bound on the mathematical entropy at any time according to its
initial condition and boundary conditions. The crux of the method is that
discrete derivative approximations in space and time are summation-by-parts
(SBP) operators. This allows the discrete method to mimic results from the
continuous entropy analysis and ensures that the complete numerical scheme
obeys the second law of thermodynamics. Importantly, the novel method described
herein does not assume any exactness of quadrature in the variational forms
that naturally arise in the context of DG methods. Typically, the development
of entropy stable schemes is done on the semi-discrete level ignoring the
temporal dependence. In this work we demonstrate that creating an entropy
stable DG method in time is similar to the spatial discrete entropy analysis,
but there are important (and subtle) differences. Therefore, we highlight the
temporal entropy analysis throughout this work. For the compressible Euler
equations, the preservation of kinetic energy is of interest besides entropy
stability. The construction of kinetic energy preserving (KEP) schemes is,
again, typically done on the semi-discrete level similar to the construction of
entropy stable schemes. We present a generalization of the KEP condition from
Jameson to the space-time framework and provide the temporal components for
both entropy stability and kinetic energy preservation. The properties of the
space-time DG method derived herein is validated through numerical tests for
the compressible Euler equations.

disturbance on the shear-induced dynamics of well-entangled DNA solutions.
Using a custom high-aspect-ratio planar-Couette cell, we systematically measure
the velocity profiles of sheared DNA samples at different distances away from
the edge of the shear cell. Under a weak oscillatory shear with the
corresponding Weissenberg number (Wi) smaller than 1, where DNA solutions
exhibit linear velocity profiles with strong wall slip, the penetration depth
of the edge disturbance is on the order of the gap thickness of the shear cell,
consistent with the behavior of Newtonian fluids. However, under a strong
oscillatory shear with Wi > 1 that produces shear-banding flows, the
penetration depth is an order of magnitude larger than the gap thickness and
becomes spatially anisotropic. Moreover, we find that the shear-banding flows
persist deep inside the sheared sample, where the effect of edge disturbance
diminishes. Hence, our experiments demonstrate an abnormally long penetration
depth of edge disturbance and illustrate the bulk nature of shear-banding flows

based on zero-temperature mean-field theory reveal several vortex splitting
behaviors that stem from the multicomponent nature of the system and do not

Bogoliubov excitations of stationary axisymmetric composite vortices, we find
nonreal excitation frequencies (dynamical instabilities) for the singly

quantized vortices, which we define by the condition
$\max_{j=1,2}|\kappa_j|=2$. While the short-time predictions of the linear
Bogoliubov analysis are confirmed by direct time integration of the
Gross-Pitaevskii equations of motion, the time integration also reveals
intricate long-time decay behavior not captured by the linearized dynamics.
First, the $(1,\pm 1)$ vortex is found to be unstable against splitting into a
$(1,0)$ vortex and a $(0,\pm 1)$ vortex. Second, the $(2,1)$ vortex exhibits a
two-step decay process in which its initial splitting into a $(2,0)$ vortex and
a $(0,1)$ vortex is followed by the off-axis splitting of the $(2,0)$ vortex
into two $(1,0)$ vortices. Third, the $(2,-2)$ vortex is observed to split into
a $(-1,1)$ vortex, three $(1,0)$ vortices, and three $(0,-1)$ vortices. Each of
these splitting processes is the dominant decay mechanism of the respective
stationary composite vortex for a wide range of intercomponent interaction
strengths and relative populations of the two condensate components and should

design. The topics considered here are driven by physics and scientific
applications. Furthermore, the main consequences of implementation decisions on
performance are outlined. We highlight the computational performance as an
important aspect guiding the design since future scientific applications will
heavily depend on an efficient use of computational resources.

used in SpEC (the Spectral Einstein Code). We introduce new boundary conditions
for the extended conformal thin sandwich elliptic equations that enforce the
excision surfaces to be slightly inside rather than on the apparent horizons,
thus avoiding extrapolation into the black holes at the last stage of initial
data construction. We find that this improves initial data constraint
violations near and inside the apparent horizons by about 3 orders of
magnitude. We construct several initial data sets that are intended to be
astrophysically equivalent but use different free data, boundary conditions,
and initial gauge conditions. These include free data chosen as a superposition
of two black holes in time-independent horizon-penetrating harmonic and damped
harmonic coordinates. We also implement initial data for which the initial
gauge satisfies the harmonic and damped harmonic gauge conditions; this can be
done independently of the free data, since this amounts to a choice of the time
derivatives of the lapse and shift. We compare these initial data sets by
evolving them. We show that the gravitational waveforms extracted during the
evolution of these different initial data sets agree very well after excluding
initial transients. However, we do find small differences between these
waveforms, which we attribute to small differences in initial orbital
eccentricity, and in initial BH masses and spins, resulting from the different
choices of free data. Among the cases considered, we find that superposed
harmonic initial data leads to significantly smaller transients, smaller
variation in BH spins and masses during these transients, smaller constraint
violations, and more computationally efficient evolutions. Finally, we study
the impact of initial data choices on the construction of zero-eccentricity
initial data.

function (IMF). However, true multiple imaging lens systems are rare, hindering

derive upper limits on $\Upsilon$ in galaxies with single close-projected
background sources, where no counter-image is detected, down to some relative
flux limit. We present a proof-of-principle application to three galaxies with
integral field observations from different instruments. In our first case
study, only a weak constraint on $\Upsilon$ is obtained. In the second, the
absence of a detectable counter-image excludes stellar masses higher than
expected for a Salpeter IMF. In the third system, the current observations do
not yield a useful limit, but our analysis indicates that deeper observations
should reveal a counter-image if the stellar mass is any larger than expected
for a Milky Way IMF. We discuss how our method can help enlarge the current
samples of low-$z$ galaxies with lensing constraints, both by adding upper
limits on $\Upsilon$ and by guiding follow-up of promising single-image systems

photoexcited systems. We present a theory for nonequilibrium x-ray absorption
spectroscopy in one-dimensional strongly correlated systems. The core hole
created by x-ray is modeled as an additional effective potential of the core
hole site which changes the spectrum qualitatively. In equilibrium, the
spectrum reveals the charge gap at half-filling and the metal-insulator
transition in the presence of the core hole effect. Furthermore, a pump-probe
scheme is introduced to drive the system out of equilibrium before the x-ray

equations readily furnish analytical dispersion relations for box arrays, slabs
and crystals, that agree favourably with finite-element simulations of the
physical problem. Our results reveal that the entire acoustic branch is
uniformly squeezed into a subwavelength regime; consequently, phononic box
crystals exhibit nonlinear-dispersion effects (such as dynamic anisotropy) in a
relatively wide band, as well as a high effective refractive index in the
long-wavelength limit. We also study the sound field produced by sources placed
within one of the boxes by comparing and contrasting monopole- with dipole-type
forcing; for the former the pressure field is asymptotically enhanced whilst
for the latter there is no asymptotic enhancement and the translation from the
microscale to the discrete description entails evaluating singular limits,
using a regularized and efficient scheme, of the Neumann's Green's function for
a cube. We conclude with an example of using our asymptotic framework to
calculate localized modes trapped within a defected box array.

meanwhile, will achieve by the LISA launch date a sensitivity that ensures
complete detection of all mergers within a volume $>\!\mathcal{O}(10)\,{\rm
Gpc}^{3}$. We propose a method to use the information from the ground to
revisit the LISA data in search for sub-threshold events. By discarding
spurious triggers that do not overlap with the ground-based catalogue, we show
that the signal-to-noise threshold $\rho_{\rm LISA}$ employed in LISA can be
significantly lowered, greatly boosting the detection rate. The efficiency of
this method depends predominantly on the rate of false-alarm increase when the
threshold is lowered and on the uncertainty in the parameter estimation for the
LISA events. As an example, we demonstrate that while all current LIGO
BBH-merger detections would have evaded detection by LISA when employing a
standard $\rho_{\rm LISA}=8$ threshold, this method will allow us to easily
(possibly) detect an event similar to GW150914 (GW170814) in LISA. Overall, we
estimate that the total rate of stellar-mass BBH mergers detected by LISA can
be boosted by a factor $\sim\!4$ ($\gtrsim\!8$) under conservative (optimistic)
assumptions. This will enable new tests using multi-band GW observations,
significantly aided by the greatly increased lever arm in frequency.

process to generate new program inputs. In this work, we present a machine
learning approach that builds on AFL, the preeminent grey-box fuzzer, by
adaptively learning a probability distribution over its mutation operators on a
program-specific basis. These operators, which are selected uniformly at random
in AFL and mutational fuzzers in general, dictate how new inputs are generated,
a core part of the fuzzer's efficacy. Our main contributions are two-fold:
First, we show that a sampling distribution over mutation operators estimated
from training programs can significantly improve performance of AFL. Second, we
introduce a Thompson Sampling, bandit-based optimization approach that
fine-tunes the mutator distribution adaptively, during the course of fuzzing an
individual program. A set of experiments across complex programs demonstrates
that tuning the mutational operator distribution generates sets of inputs that
yield significantly higher code coverage and finds more crashes faster and more
reliably than both baseline versions of AFL as well as other AFL-based learning
approaches.

Four transitions are observed with upper level energies ranging between 115 and
459 K. The emission is spatially resolved with the 0.14"" beam and follows the
Keplerian rotation previously observed for C$^{18}$O. Using a rotational
diagram analysis, we find a disk-averaged column density of $\sim10^{17}$
cm$^{-2}$ and a rotational temperature of $\sim90-100$ K, suggesting that the
methanol has thermally desorbed from the dust grains. We derive outer radii
between 120 and 140 AU for the different transitions, compared to the 360 AU
outer radius for C$^{18}$O. Depending on the exact physical structure of the
disk, the methanol emission could originate in the surface layers beyond the
water snowline. Alternatively, the bulk of the methanol emission originates
inside the water snowline, which can then be as far out as ~100 AU, instead of
42 AU as was previously inferred from the continuum opacity. In addition, these
results show that outbursting young stars like V883 Ori are good sources to

on economic output and to the sustenance of social networks. The time
allocation problem motivates our formal analysis of the resource allocation
game, where agents on a social network, who have asymmetric, private
interaction preferences, make decisions on how to allocate time, a bounded
endowment, over their neighbors. Unlike the well-known opinion formation game
on a social network, our game appears not to be a potential game, and the
Best-Response dynamics is non-differentiable making the analysis of
Best-Response dynamics non-trivial.
  In our game, we consider two types of player behavior, namely optimistic or
pessimistic, based on how they use their time endowment over their neighbors.
To analyze Best-Response dynamics, we circumvent the problem of the game not
being a potential game, through the lens of a novel two-level potential
function approach. We show that the Best-Response dynamics converges point-wise
to a Nash Equilibrium when players are all: optimistic; pessimistic; a mix of
both types. Finally, we show that the Nash Equilibrium set is non-convex but
connected, and Price of Anarchy is unbounded while Price of Stability is one.
Extensive simulations over a stylized grid reveals that the distribution of
quality of the convergence points is unimodal-we conjecture that presence of
unimodality is tied to the connectedness of Nash Equilibrium.

statistically significant improvements on task metrics when comparing a

interaction of an intense laser pulse with a relativistically transparent
target. For a relativistically transparent target, kinetic modeling shows that
the generation of energetic electrons is dominated by energy transfer within
the main, classically overdense, plasma volume. The laser pulse produces a
narrowing, funnel-like channel inside the plasma volume that generates a field
structure responsible for the electron heating. The field structure combines a
slowly evolving azimuthal magnetic field, generated by a strong laser-driven
longitudinal electron current, and, unexpectedly, a strong propagating
longitudinal electric field, generated by reflections off the walls of the
funnel-like channel. The magnetic field assists electron heating by the
transverse electric field of the laser pulse through deflections, whereas the
longitudinal electric field directly accelerates the electrons in the forward
direction. The longitudinal electric field produced by reflections is 30 times
stronger than that in the incoming laser beam and the resulting direct laser
acceleration contributes roughly one third of the energy transferred by the
transverse electric field of the laser pulse to electrons of the
super-ponderomotive tail.

realistic geometric data. The goal of such models is to generate plausible 3D
geometries and textures. Perhaps the best known of its kind is the linear 3D
morphable model (3DMM) for faces. Such models can be found at the core of many
computer vision applications such as face reconstruction, recognition and
authentication to name just a few.
  Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown great promise in imitating
high dimensional data distributions. State of the art GANs are capable of
performing tasks such as image to image translation as well as auditory and
image signal synthesis, producing novel plausible samples from the data
distribution at hand.
  Geometric data is generally more difficult to process due to the inherent
lack of an intrinsic parametrization. By bringing geometric data into an
aligned space, we are able to map the data onto a 2D plane using a universal
parametrization. This alignment process allows for efficient processing of
digitally scanned geometric data via image processing tools.
  Using this methodology, we propose a novel face synthesis model for
generation of realistic facial textures together with their corresponding
geometry. A GAN is employed in order to imitate the space of parametrized human
textures, while corresponding facial geometries are generated by learning the
best 3DMM coefficients for each texture. The generated textures are mapped back
onto the corresponding geometries to obtain new generated high resolution 3D
faces.

features due to the linear vanishing of the pristine material's density of
states at the Dirac point. Despite several attempts, conclusive experimental
observation of the phenomenon remains elusive. One likely obstacle to
identification is a very small Kondo temperature scale $T_K$ in situations
where the chemical potential lies near the Dirac point. We propose tailored
mechanical deformations of monolayer graphene as a means of revealing unique
fingerprints of the Kondo effect. Inhomogeneous strains are known to produce
specific alternating changes in the local density of states (LDOS) away from
the Dirac point that signal sublattice symmetry breaking effects. Small LDOS
changes can be amplified in an exponential increase or decrease of $T_K$ for
magnetic impurities attached at different locations. We illustrate this
behavior in two deformation geometries: a circular 'bubble' and a long fold,
both described by Gaussian displacement profiles. We calculate the LDOS changes
for modest strains and analyze the relevant Anderson impurity model describing
a magnetic atom adsorbed in either a 'top-site' or a 'hollow-site'
configuration. Numerical renormalization-group solutions of the impurity model
suggest that higher expected $T_K$ values, combined with distinctive spatial
patterns under variation of the point of graphene attachment, make the top-site
configuration the more promising for experimental observation of signatures of
the Kondo effect. The strong strain sensitivity of $T_K$ may lift top-site
Kondo physics into the range experimentally accessible using local probes such
as scanning tunneling microscopy.

pipeline consists of independent image reconstruction of single time frames,
followed by the application of a suitable kinetic model to time activity curves

PET direct reconstruction, by contrast, seeks to move beyond this scheme and
incorporate information from multiple time frames within the reconstruction
task. Existing 4D direct models are based on a deterministic description of
voxels' TACs, captured by the chosen kinetic model, considering the photon
counting process the only source of uncertainty. In this work, we introduce a
new probabilistic modeling strategy based on the key assumption that activity
time course would be subject to uncertainty even if the parameters of the
underlying dynamic process were known. This leads to a hierarchical Bayesian
model, which we formulate using the formalism of Probabilistic Graphical
Modeling (PGM). The inference of the joint probability density function arising
from PGM is addressed using a new gradient-based iterative algorithm, which
presents several advantages compared to existing direct methods: it is flexible
to an arbitrary choice of linear and nonlinear kinetic model; it enables the
inclusion of arbitrary (sub)differentiable priors for parametric maps; it is
simpler to implement and suitable to integration in computing frameworks for
machine learning. Computer simulations and an application to real patient scan
showed how the proposed approach allows us to weight the importance of the
kinetic model, providing a bridge between indirect and deterministic direct
methods.

data as the services. One of the security concerns of the outsourcing paradigm
is the integrity of the returned query results on the outsourced data. In this
paper, we consider the outsourcing of probabilistic databases, on which query
evaluation is of high complexity. A dishonest server may return cheap (and
incorrect) query answers, hoping that the client who has weak computational
power cannot catch the incorrect results. To address this issue, we design
efficient integrity verification methods for both all-answer and top-k query
evaluation on outsourced probabilistic databases. Our empirical results
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our verification methods.

conclusively determined visually or via physical examination, but by medical

we explored the approach of machine learning in developing a low-cost

recognition system that models patterns in the cries of known asphyxiating
infants (and normal infants) and then uses the developed model for
classification of `new' infants as having asphyxia or not. Our prototype has
been tested in a laboratory setting to give prediction accuracy of up to
88.85%. If higher accuracies can be obtained, this research may be a key

UHV-compatible sputter source, resulting in layer-by-layer growth and good
uniformity of the films. For thicknesses of 2-4 ML, a layer-dependent influence
of the substrate on the structure of the thin films is observed. Beyond this
thickness, films show a (2 $\times$ 1) or a distorted (2 $\times$ 2) surface
structure with respect to cubic ZrO$_2$(111); these structures correspond to
tetragonal and monoclinic zirconia, respectively. The tetragonal phase occurs
for annealing temperatures of up to 730 {\deg}C; transformation to the
thermodynamically stable monoclinic phase occurs after annealing at 850 {\deg}C
or above. High-temperature annealing also breaks up the films and exposes the
Rh(111) substrate. We argue that the tetragonal films are stabilized by oxygen
deficiency, while the monoclinic films are only weakly defective and show band
bending at defects and grain boundaries. This observation is in agreement with
positive charge being responsible for the grain-boundary blocking effect in
zirconia-based solid electrolytes. Our work introduces the tetragonal and

attachment. A simple pathological malignancy prediction model is also
introduced. We used the publicly-available LIDC-IDRI dataset pathologists

radiomics models containing this feature, and then externally validate the
models. We achieved AUC$=$0.80 and 0.76, respectively, with the models trained

reconstructed with an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.47 mm, and an
average 95th percentile 3D positional error of 2.80 mm compared with the

Jacobian of the resulting transformation was computed to measure the local MTV

robust to the bond disorder, since it does not mix different $n=0$ states
within a given valley. The mechanism of broadening of the $n=0$ LL is the
inter-valley scattering. Several numerical simulations of graphene with bond
disorder had established that $n=0$ LL is not only anomalously narrow but also
that its shape is very peculiar with three maxima, one at zero energy, $E=0$,
and two others at finite energies $\pm E$. We study theoretically the structure
of the states in $n=0$ LL in the presence of bond disorder. Adopting the
assumption that the bond disorder is strongly anisotropic, namely, that one
type of bonds is perturbed much stronger than other two, allowed us to get an
analytic expression for the density of states which agrees with numerical
simulations remarkably well. On the qualitative level, our key finding is that
delocalization of $E=0$ state has a dramatic back effect on the density of
states near $E=0$. The origin of this unusual behavior is the strong
correlation of eigenstates in different valleys.

clusterability vary radically, making it challenging to select a suitable

Janus particles exhibit a velocity-dependent tilt accompanied by a weak
variation in drag force, but never an enhancement of the drag force beyond the
value when fully immersed. This velocity dependence arises when the interface
is pinned at heterogeneities and prevents the particle from rotating, and
similar behavior is observed for homogeneous but non-spherical particles. The
occurrence of different particle orientations having different drag
coefficients may lead to an apparent violation of the Stokes-Einstein relation.

numerically simulated and explained via vortex dynamics ($\lambda_2$ method).
The instabilities on the liquid-gas interface reflect well the vortex
interactions around the interface. Certain key features are identified for the
first time. Two types of surface deformations are distinguished, which are
separated by a large indentation on the jet stem: First, those near the jet
start-up cap are encapsulated inside the recirculation zone behind the cap.
These deformations are directly related to the dynamics of the growing cap and
well explained by the vortices generated there. Second, deformations occurring
farther upstream of the cap are mainly driven by the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH)
instability at the interface. Three-dimensional deformations occur in the
vortex structures first, and the initially axisymmetric KH vortices deform and
lead to several liquid lobes, which stretch first as thinning sheets and then
either continue stretching directly into elongated ligaments - at lower
relative velocity - or perforate to create liquid bridges and holes - at higher
relative velocity. The different scenarios depend on Weber and Reynolds numbers
based on the relative gas-liquid velocity as was found in the temporal studies.
The deformations in the upstream region are well portrayed in a frame moving
with the convective velocity of the liquid jet. The usefulness of the temporal
analyses are now established.

Cancellation (SIC) is required at each receiver to remove the multicast stream
before decoding its intended unicast stream. In this paper, we first show that
a linearly-precoded 1-layer Rate-Splitting (RS) strategy at the transmitter can
efficiently exploit this existing SIC receiver architecture. We further propose
multi-layer transmission strategies based on the generalized RS and
power-domain Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA). Two different objectives
are studied for the design of the precoders, namely, maximizing the Weighted
Sum Rate (WSR) of the unicast messages and maximizing the system Energy
Efficiency (EE), both subject to Quality of Service (QoS) rate requirements of
all the messages and a sum power constraint. A Weighted Minimum Mean Square
Error (WMMSE)-based algorithm and a Successive Convex Approximation (SCA)-based

Numerical results show that the proposed RS-assisted NOUM transmission
strategies are more spectrally and energy efficient than the conventional
Multi-User Linear-Precoding (MU-LP), Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) and
power-domain NOMA in a wide range of user deployments (with a diversity of

varying quality to estimate underlying binary latent variables in the presence
of restrictions imposed to respect the scientific context. The resulting
algorithms cluster the multivariate binary data in a manner partly guided by
prior knowledge. The primary model assumptions are that 1) subjects belong to
classes defined by unobserved binary states, such as the true presence or
absence of pathogens in epidemiology, or of antibodies in medicine, or the
""ability"" to correctly answer test questions in psychology, 2) a binary design
matrix $\Gamma$ specifies relevant features in each class, and 3) measurements
are independent given the latent class but can have different error rates.
Conditions ensuring parameter identifiability from the likelihood function are
discussed and inform the design of a novel posterior inference algorithm that
simultaneously estimates the number of clusters, design matrix $\Gamma$, and
model parameters. In finite samples and dimensions, we propose prior
assumptions so that the posterior distribution of the number of clusters and
the patterns of latent states tend to concentrate on smaller values and sparser
patterns, respectively. The model readily extends to studies where some
subjects' latent classes are known or important prior knowledge about
differential measurement accuracy is available from external sources. The
methods are illustrated with an analysis of protein data to detect clusters
representing auto-antibody classes among scleroderma patients.

DPP model, which is a four-field mathematical model, describes the flow of a
single-phase incompressible fluid in a porous medium with two distinct
pore-networks and with a possibility of mass transfer between them. Using the
composable solvers feature available in PETSc and the finite element libraries
available under the Firedrake Project, we illustrate two different ways by
which one can effectively precondition these large systems of equations.
Second, we employ the recently developed performance model called the
Time-Accuracy-Size (TAS) spectrum to demonstrate that the proposed composable
block solvers are scalable in both the parallel and algorithmic sense.
Moreover, we utilize this spectrum analysis to compare the performance of three
different finite element discretizations (classical mixed formulation with
H(div) elements, stabilized continuous Galerkin mixed formulation, and
stabilized discontinuous Galerkin mixed formulation) for the DPP model. Our
performance spectrum analysis demonstrates that the composable block solvers
are fine choices for any of these three finite element discretizations. Sample
computer codes are provided to illustrate how one can easily implement the
proposed block solver methodologies through PETSc command line options.

networks (DANNs) in this context. DANNs are designed to be trained in one
domain (simulated data) but tested in a second domain (physics data) and
utilize unlabeled data from the second domain so that during training only
features which are unable to discriminate between the domains are promoted.
MINERvA is a neutrino-nucleus scattering experiment using the NuMI beamline at
Fermilab. $A$-dependent cross sections are an important part of the physics
program, and these measurements require vertex finding in complicated events.
To illustrate the impact of the DANN we used a modified set of simulation in
place of physics data during the training of the DANN and then used the label
of the modified simulation during the evaluation of the DANN. We find that deep
learning based methods offer significant advantages over our prior track-based
reconstruction for the task of vertex finding, and that DANNs are able to
improve the performance of deep networks by leveraging available unlabeled data
and by mitigating network performance degradation rooted in biases in the
physics models used for training.

result is based on eigenspace at eigenvalue 0 of the associated Koopman
operator, which is realized via time-averages of observables, and provides a
constructive way to visualize a low-dimensional slice through a
high-dimensional invariant set. We apply the result to the systems with a
finite number of attractors and show that the time-average of a continuous
observable is well-defined and reveals the invariant sets, namely, a finite
number of basins of attraction. We provide a characterization of invariant sets
in the quasiperiodically forced systems. A theoretical result on uniform
boundedness of the invariant sets is presented. The series of theoretical
results enables numerical analysis of invariant sets in the quasiperiodically
forced systems based on the ergodic partition and time-averages. Using this, we
analyze a nonlinear model of complex power grids that represents the short-term
swing instability, named the coherent swing instability. We show that our

system at underwater environments, several problems should be compensated,
i.e., refraction, disturbance by fluctuation and bubbles. Further, since
surface of the objects are interfered by the bubbles, projected patterns, etc.,
those noises and patterns should be removed from captured images to recover
original texture. To solve these problems, we propose three approaches; a
depth-dependent calibration, Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)-stereo method
and CNN-based texture recovery method. A depth-dependent calibration is our
analysis to find the acceptable depth range for approximation by center
projection to find the certain target depth for calibration. In terms of CNN
stereo, unlike common CNNbased stereo methods which do not consider strong
disturbances like refraction or bubbles, we designed a novel CNN architecture
for stereo matching using multi-scale information, which is intended to be
robust against such disturbances. Finally, we propose a multi-scale method for
bubble and a projected-pattern removal method using CNNs to recover original

reconstruction of a live swimming fish is demonstrated to confirm the

standalone hardware to networked smart devices. Smart traffic control enables
operators to decrease traffic congestion and environmental impact by acquiring
real-time traffic data and changing traffic signals from fixed to adaptive
schedules. However, these capabilities have inadvertently exposed traffic
control to a wide range of cyber-attacks, which adversaries can easily mount
through wireless networks or even through the Internet. Indeed, recent studies
have found that a large number of traffic signals that are deployed in practice
suffer from exploitable vulnerabilities, which adversaries may use to take
control of the devices. Thanks to the hardware-based failsafes that most
devices employ, adversaries cannot cause traffic accidents directly by setting
compromised signals to dangerous configurations. Nonetheless, an adversary
could cause disastrous traffic congestion by changing the schedule of
compromised traffic signals, thereby effectively crippling the transportation
network. To provide theoretical foundations for the protection of
transportation networks from these attacks, we introduce a game-theoretic model
of launching, detecting, and mitigating attacks that tamper with traffic-signal

challenging problem, and we propose efficient heuristic algorithms for finding
near optimal strategies. We also introduce a Gaussian-process based anomaly

preconditions for using nonlinear optical materials in nonlinear optical
devices. For a crystal, such large coefficients can be achieved by matching
photon energies with resonant energies between different bands, and so the
details of the crystal band structure play an important role. Here we
demonstrate that large third-order nonlinearities can also be generally
obtained by a different strategy: As any of the incident frequencies or the sum
of any two or three frequencies approaches zero, the doped or excited
populations of electronic states lead to divergent contributions in the induced
current density. We refer to these as intraband divergences, by analogy with
the behavior of Drude conductivity in linear response. Physically, such
resonant processes can be associated with a combination of inraband and
interband optical transitions. Current-induced second order nonlinearity,
coherent current injection, and jerk currents are all related to such
divergences, and we find similar divergences in degenerate four wave mixing and
cross-phase modulation under certain conditions. These divergences are limited
by intraband relaxation parameters, and lead to a large optical response from a
high quality sample; we find they are very robust with respect to variations in
the details of the band structure. To clearly track all of these effects, we
analyze gapped graphene, describing the electrons as massive Dirac fermions;
under the relaxation time approximation, we derive analytic expressions for the
third order conductivities, and identify the divergences that arise in

significant error performance advantages over orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) in delay--Doppler channels. In order to detect OTFS
modulated data, the channel impulse response needs to be known at the receiver.
In this paper, we propose embedded pilot-aided channel estimation schemes for
OTFS. In each OTFS frame, we arrange pilot, guard, and data symbols in the
delay--Doppler plane to suitably avoid interference between pilot and data
symbols at the receiver. We develop such symbol arrangements for OTFS over
multipath channels with integer and fractional Doppler shifts, respectively. At
the receiver, channel estimation is performed based on a threshold method and
the estimated channel information is used for data detection via a message
passing (MP) algorithm. Thanks to our specific embedded symbol arrangements,
both channel estimation and data detection are performed within the same OTFS
frame with a minimum overhead. We compare by simulations the error performance
of OTFS using the proposed channel estimation and OTFS with ideally known
channel information and observe only a marginal performance loss. We also
demonstrate that the proposed channel estimation in OTFS significantly
outperforms OFDM with known channel information. Finally, we present extensions
of the proposed schemes to MIMO and multi-user uplink/downlink.

for data with a singular behavior of the form relevant for gravitational waves,

learning algorithms. We attempt to classify a sample of Orion YSOs into
different classes, where each source has already been classified using
multiwavelength SED analysis. We used 8 different learning algorithms to
classify the target YSOs, namely a decision tree, random forest, gradient
boosting machine (GBM), logistic regression, na\""ive Bayes classifier,
$k$-nearest neighbour classifier, support vector machine, and neural network.
The classifiers were trained and tested by using a 10-fold cross-validation
procedure. As the learning features, we employed ten continuum flux densities
spanning from the near-IR to submm. With a classification accuracy of 82% (with
respect to the SED-based classes), a GBM algorithm was found to exhibit the
best performance. The lowest accuracy of 47% was obtained with a na\""ive Bayes
classifier. Our analysis suggests that the inclusion of the 3.6 $\mu$m and 24
$\mu$m flux densities is useful to maximise the YSO classification accuracy.
Although machine learning has the potential to provide a rapid and fairly
reliable way to classify YSOs, an SED analysis is still needed to derive the
physical properties of the sources, and to create the labelled training data.
The classification accuracies can be improved with respect to the present
results by using larger data sets, more detailed missing value imputation, and
advanced ensemble methods. Overall, the application of machine learning is
expected to be very useful in the era of big astronomical data, for example to
quickly assemble interesting target source samples for follow-up studies.

investigate the detectability of biosignatures in anoxic atmospheres analogous

detect carbon dioxide and constrain methane abundances sufficiently well to
rule out known, non-biological CH$_{4}$ production scenarios to ~90%

Each object also carries semantic information which is refined over time and an
existence probability to account for spurious instance predictions. We
demonstrate our approach on a hand-held RGB-D sequence from a cluttered office

and Schwarzschild radius $(R_S \propto M$) are dual under the transformation $M
\rightarrow M_{P}^2/M$, where $M_{P}$ is the Planck mass. This suggests that
there could be a fundamental link -- termed the Black Hole Uncertainty
Principle or Compton-Schwarzschild correspondence -- between elementary
particles with $M < M_{P}$ and black holes in the $M > M_{P}$ regime. In the
presence of $n$ extra dimensions, compactified on some scale $R_E$ exceeding
the Planck length $R_P$, one expects $R_S \propto M^{1/(1+n)}$ for $R_P < R <
R_E$, which breaks this duality. However, it may be restored in some
circumstances because the {\it effective} Compton wavelength of a particle
depends on the form of the $(3+n)$-dimensional wavefunction. If this is
spherically symmetric, then one still has $R_C \propto M^{-1}$, as in the
$3$-dimensional case. The effective Planck length is then increased and the
Planck mass reduced, allowing the possibility of TeV quantum gravity and black
hole production at the LHC. However, if the wave function of a particle is
asymmetric and has a scale $R_E$ in the extra dimensions, then $R_C \propto
M^{-1/(1+n)}$, so that the duality between $R_C$ and $R_S$ is preserved. In
this case, the effective Planck length is increased even more but the Planck
mass is unchanged, so that TeV quantum gravity is precluded and black holes
cannot be generated in collider experiments. Nevertheless, the extra dimensions
could still have consequences for the detectability of black hole evaporations
and the enhancement of pair-production at accelerators on scales below $R_E$.
Though phenomenologically general for higher-dimensional theories, our results
are shown to be consistent with string theory via the minimum positional
uncertainty derived from $D$-particle scattering amplitudes.

Galactic Archeology. With the expected excellent data from the TESS and PLATO
missions, red giants will again play a key role in Galactic studies and stellar
physics, thanks to the precise masses and radii determined by asteroseismology.
The determination of these quantities is often based on so-called scaling laws,
which have been used extensively for main-sequence stars. We show how the SOLA
inversion technique can provide robust determinations of the mean density of
red giants within 1 per cent of the real value, using only radial oscillations.
Combined with radii determinations from Gaia of around 2 per cent precision,
this approach provides robust, less model-dependent masses with an error lower
than 10 per cent. It will improve age determinations, helping to accurately
dissect the Galactic structure and history. We present results on artificial
data of standard models, models including an extended atmosphere from averaged
3D simulations and non-adiabatic frequency calculations to test surface
effects, and on eclipsing binaries. We show that the inversions provide very
robust mean density estimates, using at best seismic information. However, we
also show that a distinction between red-giant branch and red-clump stars is
required to determine a reliable estimate of the mean density. The stability of
the inversion enables an implementation in automated pipelines, making it
suitable for large samples of stars.

originates from the inner accretion disk. Here we report the detection of a new
ultra-fast outflow (UFO) with a velocity of $v_{\rm
out}=0.319^{+0.005}_{-0.008}c$ in addition to a relativistic disk reflection
component in a poorly studied NLS1 WKK~4438, based on archival \nustar and
\suzaku observations. The spectra of both \suzaku and \nustar observations show
an Fe~\textsc{xxvi} absorption feature and the \suzaku data also show evidence
for an Ar~\textsc{xviii} with the same blueshift. A super-solar argon abundance
($Z^{\prime}_{\rm Ar}>6Z_{\odot}$) and a slight iron over-abundance
($Z^{\prime}_{\rm Fe}=2.6^{+1.9}_{-2.0}Z_{\odot}$) are found in our spectral
modelling. Based on Monte-Carlo simulations, the detection of the UFO is
estimated to be around at 3$\sigma$ significance. The fast wind most likely
arises from a radius of $\geq20r_g$ away from the central black hole. The disk
is accreting at a high Eddington ratio ($L_{\rm bol}=0.4-0.7L_{\rm Edd}$). The
mass outflow rate of the UFO is comparable with the disk mass inflow rate
($\dot M_{\rm out}>30\%\dot M_{\rm in}$), assuming a maximum covering factor.
The kinetic power of the wind might not be high enough to have influence in AGN
feedback ($\dot E_{\rm wind}/L_{\rm bol}\approx 3-5\%$) due to a relatively
small column density ($12^{+9}_{-4}\times10^{22}$~cm$^{-2}$). However note that
both the inferred velocity and the column density could be lower limits owing
to the low viewing angle ($i=23^{+3}_{-2}$$^{\circ}$).

tourism are exposed to high tourism pressures and those are mainly coastal
marine regions. Our current tourism management approaches are not achieving
biodiversity conservation. The global increase in nature tourism and recreation

Lindsten et al. (2017) to investigate the smoothing problem in a hidden Markov

sub-models with intermediate target distributions based on an auxiliary tree
structure and produce independent samples from the sub-models at the leaf nodes
towards the original model of interest at the root. We review the target
distribution in the sub-models suggested by Lindsten et al. and propose two new
classes of target distributions, which are the estimates of the (joint)
filtering distributions and the (joint) smoothing distributions. The first
proposed type is straightforwardly constructible by running a filtering
algorithm in advance. The algorithm using the second type of target
distributions has an advantage of roughly retaining the marginals of all random
variables invariant at all levels of the tree at the cost of approximating the
marginal smoothing distributions in advance. We further propose the
constructions of these target distributions using pre-generated Monte Carlo
samples. We show empirically the algorithms with the proposed intermediate
target distributions give stable and comparable results as the conventional
smoothing methods in a linear Gaussian model and a non-linear model.

This results in a drastically lower latency without reducing throughput or
forfeiting reliability and security guarantees. To demonstrate the wide

a potential alternative to traditional databases and, thanks to its streaming

realistic colors, fonts, and character composition from a small number of real,

accuracy improvement caused by data generation becomes more significant when
the number of labeled images is reduced. Data augmentation also plays a more
significant role when the number of labeled images is increased.

neuronal avalanching. In a large class of continuous-time branching processes,
we study the temporal scaling of the moments of the instant population size,
the survival probability, expected avalanche duration, the so-called avalanche
shape, the $n$-point correlation function and the probability density function
of the total avalanche size. Previous studies have shown universality in
certain observables of branching processes using probabilistic arguments,
however, a comprehensive description is lacking. We derive the field theory
that describes the process and demonstrate how to use it to calculate the
relevant observables and their scaling to leading order in time, revealing the
universality of the moments of the population size. Our results explain why the
first and second moment of the offspring distribution are sufficient to fully
characterise the process in the vicinity of criticality, regardless of the
underlying offspring distribution. This finding implies that branching
processes are universal. We illustrate our analytical results with computer
simulations.

classic $(\Delta+1)$-coloring problem, and its generalization
$(\Delta+1)$-list-coloring, in three well-studied models of distributed,
parallel, and centralized computation:
  Distributed Congested Clique: We present an $O(1)$-round randomized algorithm
for $(\Delta+1)$-list coloring in the congested clique model of distributed
computing. This settles the asymptotic complexity of this problem. It moreover
improves upon the $O(\log^\ast \Delta)$-round randomized algorithms of Parter
and Su [DISC'18] and $O((\log\log \Delta)\cdot \log^\ast \Delta)$-round
randomized algorithm of Parter [ICALP'18].
  Massively Parallel Computation: We present a $(\Delta+1)$-list coloring
algorithm with round complexity $O(\sqrt{\log\log n})$ in the Massively
Parallel Computation (MPC) model with strongly sublinear memory per machine.
This algorithm uses a memory of $O(n^{\alpha})$ per machine, for any desirable
constant $\alpha>0$, and a total memory of $\widetilde{O}(m)$, where $m$ is the
size of the graph. Notably, this is the first coloring algorithm with
sublogarithmic round complexity, in the sublinear memory regime of MPC. For the
quasilinear memory regime of MPC, an $O(1)$-round algorithm was given very
recently by Assadi et al. [SODA'19].
  Centralized Local Computation: We show that $(\Delta+1)$-list coloring can be
solved with $\Delta^{O(1)} \cdot O(\log n)$ query complexity, in the
centralized local computation model. The previous state-of-the-art for
$(\Delta+1)$-list coloring in the centralized local computation model are based
on simulation of known LOCAL algorithms.

Chaplygin model (QCM) with three different equation-of-states within
ultraviolet (UV) deformed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmologies without
Big-Bang singularity. The UV deformation is inspired by the non-commutative
(NC) Snyder spacetime approach in which by keeping the transformation groups
and rotational symmetry there is a dimensionless, Planck scale characteristic
parameter $\mu_0$ with dual implications dependent on its sign that addresses
the required invariant cutoffs for length and momentum in nature, in a separate
manner. Our stability analysis is done in the $(H,\rho)$ phase space at a
finite domain concerning the hyperbolic critical points. According to our
analysis, due to constraints imposed on the signs of $\mu_0$ from the
phenomenological parameters involved in quartessence models $(\Omega_m^*,
c_s^2, \rho_*)$, for an expanding and accelerating late universe, all three
QCMs can be stable in the vicinity of the critical points. The requirement of
stability for these quartessence models in case of admission of a minimum
invariant length, can yield a flat as well as non-flat expanding and
accelerating universe in which Big-Bang singularity is absent. This feedback
also phenomenologically credits to braneworld-like framework versus loop
quantum cosmology-like one as two possible scenarios which can be NC Snyder
spacetime generators (correspond to $\mu_0<0$ and $\mu_0>0$, respectively). As
a result, our analysis show that between quartessence models with Chaplygin gas
equation-of-states and accelerating FRW backgrounds occupied by a minimum
invariant length, there is a possibility of viability.

parallel paraphrases in multiple languages from various sources. We treat
paraphrases as foreign languages, tag source sentences with paraphrase labels,

outperforms the multilingual baselines. Adding paraphrases improves the rare
word translation and increases entropy and diversity in lexical choice. Adding
the source paraphrases boosts performance better than adding the target ones.

UV radiation that modulates the photochemistry of planets atmospheres. After
correcting the SOLSTICE data for residual instrumental effects that produced
asymmetric signals during different phases of the cycles analyzed, the authors
found that the UV color index is linearly correlated with the Mg II index.In
this paper we employ an irradiance reconstruction technique to synthetize the
UV color and Mg II index with the purpose of investigating whether the
correction applied by \citet{lovric2017} to SORCE/SOLSTICE data might have
compensated for solar variations, and to investigate the physical mechanisms
that produce such a strong correlation between the UV color index and the solar
activity. Reconstructed indices reproduce very well the observations and
present the same strong linear dependence. Moreover our reconstruction, which
extends back to 1989, shows that the UV color - Mg II index relation can be
described by the same linear relation for almost three cycles, thus ruling out
an overcompensation of SORCE/SOLTICE data in the analysis of
\citet{lovric2017}. We suggest that the strong correlation between the indices
results from the fact that most of the Far- and Middle- UV radiation originates
in the chromosphere, where atmosphere models of quiet and magnetic features
present similar temperature and density gradients.

  The answer relies on the potential responses, which can incorporate
information about what would have happened to the outcome as we had observed a
different value of the exposure. However, even given the best possible
statistical evidence for the association between exposure and outcome, we can
typically only provide bounds for the PC. Dawid et al. (2016) highlighted some
fundamental conditions, namely, exogeneity, comparability, and sufficiency,
required to obtain such bounds, based on experimental data. The aim of the
present paper is to provide methods to find, in specific cases, the best
subsample of the reference dataset to satisfy such requirements. To this end,
we introduce a new variable, expressing the desire to be exposed or not, and we
set the question up as a model selection problem. The best model will be
selected using the marginal probability of the responses and a suitable prior

critical domains, urgently calling for ways to test their correctness and
robustness. Testing of DL systems has traditionally relied on manual collection
and labelling of data. Recently, a number of coverage criteria based on neuron
activation values have been proposed. These criteria essentially count the
number of neurons whose activation during the execution of a DL system
satisfied certain properties, such as being above predefined thresholds.
However, existing coverage criteria are not sufficiently fine grained to
capture subtle behaviours exhibited by DL systems. Moreover, evaluations have
focused on showing correlation between adversarial examples and proposed
criteria rather than evaluating and guiding their use for actual testing of DL
systems. We propose a novel test adequacy criterion for testing of DL systems,
called Surprise Adequacy for Deep Learning Systems (SADL), which is based on
the behaviour of DL systems with respect to their training data. We measure the
surprise of an input as the difference in DL system's behaviour between the
input and the training data (i.e., what was learnt during training), and
subsequently develop this as an adequacy criterion: a good test input should be
sufficiently but not overtly surprising compared to training data. Empirical
evaluation using a range of DL systems from simple image classifiers to
autonomous driving car platforms shows that systematic sampling of inputs based
on their surprise can improve classification accuracy of DL systems against
adversarial examples by up to 77.5% via retraining.

actions toward accomplishing a specific task under a certain scene, which is a
new problem in computer vision research. The primary challenges are how to
model task-specific knowledge and how to integrate this knowledge into the
learning procedure. In this work, we propose training a recurrent long
short-term memory (LSTM) network to address this problem, i.e., taking a scene
image (including pre-located objects) and the specified task as input and
recurrently predicting action sequences. However, training such a network
generally requires large numbers of annotated samples to cover the semantic
space (e.g., diverse action decomposition and ordering). To overcome this
issue, we introduce a knowledge and-or graph (AOG) for task description, which
hierarchically represents a task as atomic actions. With this AOG
representation, we can produce many valid samples (i.e., action sequences
according to common sense) by training another auxiliary LSTM network with a
small set of annotated samples. Furthermore, these generated samples (i.e.,
task-oriented action sequences) effectively facilitate training of the model
for semantic task planning. In our experiments, we create a new dataset that
contains diverse daily tasks and extensively evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach.

the numerical results as functions of the fields $B$ and $E_z$ for finite

conduction band, to a beating in the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations when
it's weak, and to their splitting when it's strong. The Zeeman terms and
$E_{z}$ suppress the beating and change the positions of the beating nodes of
the SdH oscillations at low $B$ fields and enhance their splitting at high $B$
fields. Similar beating patterns are observed in the spin and valley
polarizations at low $B$ fields. Interestingly, a $90\%$ spin polarization and

being at risk of conforming to a negative stereotype about one's social,
gender, or racial group. This can lead women scientists to underperform or to
leave their scientific career because of negative stereotypes such as, not
being as talented or as interested in science as men. Sadly, history rarely
provides role models for women scientists; instead, it often renders these
women invisible. In response to this situation, we present a selection of
twelve outstanding women who helped to develop nuclear astrophysics.

  Wechselwirkungen der Natur in der Quantentheorie der Ur-Alternativen","110 pages, in German, 2 figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this research work the quantum theory of Ur-alternatives of Carl Friedrich
von Weizs\""acker is considered. In This theory all objects and interactions in
nature are constituted by abstract purely quantum logical relations in time.
Such structures can be devided into binary alternatives, which are called
Ur-Alternatives with respect to this principle meaning, and this leads to a
tensor space of many Ur-alternatives. The indistinguishability of the
Ur-alternatives yields two Hilbert spaces, the tensor space of symmetric and
antisymmetric states under permutations of the Ur-alternatives. It is shown how
the structures in the symmetric space can be represented in a three dimensional
real position space connected to time according to special relativity.
Accordingly this theory obtains ultimately a deep understanding of the
EPR-paradox, since logic is independent of topological structures and causal
relations in space. The antisymmetric space, which because of the Pauli
principle contains much less degress of freedem, yields the additional quantum
numbers of the elementary particles. Based on the demand for the highest
possible symmetry in the tensor space, the Yang-Mills gauge theories of the
standard model as well as a translational gauge formulation of general
relativity in a purely quantum logical description are derived. The equations
determine entanglements of states containing many Ur-alternatives and this
concept is the analogue to classical pointwise interactions between separated
objects. This means that the main structures of the SU(N)-interactions of the
standard model of elementary particle physics as well as gravitation according
to general relativiy are unified in a purely quantum theoretical conceptional
framework. Finally it is derived an extended version of the E8-group, the
biggest exceptional Lie-group.

Cheng, and Guo-En Chang","Mid-infrared GeSn Electro-Absorption Optical Modulators on Silicon","14 pages, 5 figures",,,,"physics.app-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mid-infrared silicon photonics has recently emerged as a new technology for a
wide range of applications such as optical communication, lidar, and
bio-sensing. One key component enabling this technology is the mid-infrared
optical modulator used for encoding optical signals. Here, we present a GeSn
electro-absorption modulator that can operate in the mid-infrared range.
Importantly, this device is monolithically integrated on a silicon substrate,
which provides compatibility with standard complementary
metal-oxide-semiconductor technology for scalable manufacturing. By alloying Ge
with Sn to engineer the bandgap, we observed a clear Franz-Keldysh effect and
achieved optimal modulation in the mid-infrared range of 2067-2208 nm with a
maximum absorption ratio of 1.8. The results on the Si-based mid-infrared
optical modulator open a new avenue for next-generation mid-infrared silicon
photonics.
