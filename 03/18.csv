near to the event horizon. It reveals that the radial motion has exponential
growing nature which indicates that there is a possibility of inducing chaos in
the particle motion of an integrable system when it comes under the influence
of the horizon. This is being confirmed by investigating the Poincar$\acute{e}$
section of the trajectories with the introduction of a harmonic trap to confine
the particle's motion. Two situations are investigated: (a) {\it any} static,
spherically symmetric black hole and, (b) spacetime represents a stationary,
axisymmetric black hole (e.g., Kerr metric). In both cases, the largest
Lyapunov exponent has upper bound which is the surface gravity of the horizon.
We find that the inclusion of rotation in the spacetime introduces more chaotic
fluctuations in the system. The possible implications are finally discussed.

Though structured knowledge bases were considered in content-based approaches,
they have been largely neglected recently due to the availability of vast

  However, structured knowledge bases exhibit unique advantages in personalized

using knowledge bases for recommendation is how to integrated large-scale

similar superpixels into regions. This approach raises two key issues: (1) how
to compute the similarity between superpixels in order to perform accurate
merging and (2) in which order those superpixels must be merged together. In
this perspective, we firstly introduce a robust adaptive multi-scale superpixel
similarity in which region comparisons are made both at content and common
border level. Secondly, we propose a global merging strategy to efficiently
guide the region merging process. Such strategy uses an adpative merging
criterion to ensure that best region aggregations are given highest priorities.
This allows to reach a final segmentation into consistent regions with strong
boundary adherence. We perform experiments on the BSDS500 image dataset to
highlight to which extent our method compares favorably against other
well-known image segmentation algorithms. The obtained results demonstrate the

program verifier. The main novelty of Meta-F* is allowing the use of tactics
and metaprogramming to discharge assertions not solvable by SMT, or to just
simplify them into well-behaved SMT fragments. Plus, Meta-F* can be used to
generate verified code automatically.
  Meta-F* is implemented as an F* effect, which, given the powerful effect
system of F*, heavily increases code reuse and even enables the lightweight
verification of metaprograms. Metaprograms can be either interpreted, or
compiled to efficient native code that can be dynamically loaded into the F*
type-checker and can interoperate with interpreted code. Evaluation on
realistic case studies shows that Meta-F* provides substantial gains in proof
development, efficiency, and robustness.

a new method to design a fixed-order controller by minimizing the $L_\infty$

all nonsmooth and nonconvex we use a sequential quadratic programming method
based on quasi-Newton updating that is intended for this problem class,
available in the open-source software package GRANSO. Using a publicly

We suggest
here an extension of this concept to the case of functional data. More
precisely, the proposed definition concerns those statistical problems where
the sample data are real functions defined on a compact interval of the real
line. The obvious difficulty for such a functional extension is the
non-invertibility of the covariance operator in infinite-dimensional cases.
Unlike other recent proposals, our definition is suggested and motivated in
terms of the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) associated with the
stochastic process that generates the data. The proposed distance is a true
metric; it depends on a unique real smoothing parameter which is fully
motivated in RKHS terms. Moreover, it shares some properties of its finite
dimensional counterpart: it is invariant under isometries, it can be
consistently estimated from the data and its sampling distribution is known
under Gaussian models. An empirical study for two statistical applications,
outliers detection and binary classification, is included. The obtained results
are quite competitive when compared to other recent proposals of the

time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) was previously proposed to measure
in-plane anisotropic thermal conductivity. However, a detailed analysis of the

be large if the laser spot size or the modulation frequency is not properly
chosen. Here we propose an alternative approach based on TDTR to measure
in-plane anisotropic thermal conductivity using a highly elliptical pump
(heating) beam. The highly elliptical pump beam induces a quasi-one-dimensional
temperature profile on the sample surface that has a fast decay along the short
axis of the pump beam. The detected TDTR signal is exclusively sensitive to the
in-plane thermal conductivity along the short axis of the elliptical beam. By
conducting TDTR measurements as a function of delay time with the rotation of
the elliptical pump beam to different orientations, the in-plane thermal
conductivity tensor of the sample can be determined. In this work, we first
conduct detailed signal sensitivity analyses for both techniques and provide
guidelines in determining the optimal experimental conditions. We then compare
the two techniques under their optimal experimental conditions by measuring the
in-plane thermal conductivity tensor of a ZnO [11-20] sample. The accuracy and
limitations of both methods are discussed.

first multi-device, multi-tenant algorithm for GP-EI that is aware of

laminates (formed in a macroscopic crystal) comprise domains that are a few
nanometers in size, the domain-wall energy becomes significant, and the
behaviour of laminate patterns at this scale is not known. Here, a phase-field
model, which accounts for gradient energy and strain energy contributions, is
employed to explore the stability and evolution of the nanoscale multi-rank

laminates are computed. The effect of scaling is also discussed. In the absence
of external loading, stripe domain patterns are found to be lower energy states
than the more complex, multi-rank laminates, which mostly collapse into simpler
patterns. However, complex laminates can be stabilized by imposing external
loads such as electric field, average strain and polarization. The study
provides insight into the domain patterns that may form on a macroscopic single
crystal but comprising of nanoscale periodic patterns, and on the effect of
external loads on these patterns.

of neural networks, i.e., obtaining provable guarantees that neural networks
satisfy specifications relating their inputs and outputs (robustness to bounded

was limited in its applicability by the size of the network, network
architecture and the complexity of properties to be verified. In contrast, our
framework applies to a general class of activation functions and specifications
on neural network inputs and outputs. We formulate verification as an
optimization problem (seeking to find the largest violation of the
specification) and solve a Lagrangian relaxation of the optimization problem to
obtain an upper bound on the worst case violation of the specification being
verified. Our approach is anytime i.e. it can be stopped at any time and a
valid bound on the maximum violation can be obtained. We develop specialized
verification algorithms with provable tightness guarantees under special
assumptions and demonstrate the practical significance of our general
verification approach on a variety of verification tasks.

conditional means. In the second step, the predictions are included in a linear
model for the latent outcome variable. We show that this procedure is
consistent and identifies its asymptotic distribution. We also illustrate how
this framework easily allows the association between latent variables to be

make efficient medical decisions about the severely ill patients staying in
intensive care units. As a result, various methods have been developed to
address this problem based on clinical records. However, some of the laboratory
test results are time-consuming and need to be processed. In this paper, we
propose a novel method to predict mortality using features extracted from the
heart signals of patients within the first hour of ICU admission. In order to
predict the risk, quantitative features have been computed based on the heart
rate signals of ICU patients. Each signal is described in terms of 12
statistical and signal-based features. The extracted features are fed into
eight classifiers: decision tree, linear discriminant, logistic regression,
support vector machine (SVM), random forest, boosted trees, Gaussian SVM, and
K-nearest neighborhood (K-NN). To derive insight into the performance of the
proposed method, several experiments have been conducted using the well-known
clinical dataset named Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III
(MIMIC-III). The experimental results demonstrate the capability of the
proposed method in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The decision tree classifier
satisfies both accuracy and interpretability better than the other classifiers,
producing an F1-score and AUC equal to 0.91 and 0.93, respectively. It
indicates that heart rate signals can be used for predicting mortality in
patients in the ICU, achieving a comparable performance with existing
predictions that rely on high dimensional features from clinical records which
need to be processed and may contain missing information.

double Dirac points along the high symmetry points and the corresponding Fermi

(SDE) in the Euclidean formulation of local quantum gauge field theory, with
Coulomb gauge condition $\partial_i A_i = 0$. We continue a previous study
which kept only instantaneous terms in the SDE that are proportional to
$\delta(t)$ in order to calculate the instantaneous part of the time component
of the gluon propagator $D_{A_0 A_0}(t, R)$. We compare the results of that
study with a numerical simulation of lattice gauge theory and find that the
infrared critical exponents and related quantities agree to within 1\% to 3\%.
This raises the question, ""Why is the agreement so good, despite the systematic
neglect of non-instantaneous terms?"" We discovered the happy circumstance that
all the non-instantaneous terms are in fact zero. They are forbidden by the
symmetry of the local action in Coulomb gauge under time-dependent gauge
transformations $g(t)$. This remnant gauge symmetry is not fixed by the Coulomb
gauge condition. The numerical result of the present calculation is the same as
in the previous study; the novelty is that we now demonstrate that all the
non-instantaneous terms in the SDE vanish. We derive some elementary properties
of propagators which are a consequence of the remnant gauge symmetry. In
particular the time component of the gluon propagator is found to be purely
instantaneous $D_{A_0 A_0}(t, R) = \delta(t) V(R)$, where $V(R)$ is the
color-Coulomb potential. Our results support the simple physical scenario in
which confinement is the result of a linearly rising color-Coulomb potential,
$V(R) \sim \sigma R$ at large $R$.

outperform the traditional gradient descent based methods in both accuracy and

regressor's training data comes from the output of previous regressor.
Moreover, training multiple regressors requires lots of computing resources,
especially for deep learning based methods. In this paper, we develop a
Self-Iterative Regression (SIR) framework to improve the model efficiency. Only
one self-iterative regressor is trained to learn the descent directions for
samples from coarse stages to fine stages, and parameters are iteratively
updated by the same regressor. Specifically, we proposed Landmarks-Attention
Network (LAN) as our regressor, which concurrently learns features around each
landmark and obtains the holistic location increment. By doing so, not only the
rest of regressors are removed to simplify the training process, but the number
of model parameters is significantly decreased. The experiments demonstrate
that with only 3.72M model parameters, our proposed method achieves the

in terahertz (THz) regime holds fascinating prospects for filling the THz gap
in various functional devices. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid
metamaterial to actively manipulate the resonance strength of EIT effect. By
integrating a monolayer graphene into a THz metal metamaterial, an on-to-off
modulation of the EIT transparency window is achieved under different Fermi
levels of graphene. According to the classical two-particle model and the
distributions of the electric field and surface charge density, the physical
mechanism is attributable to the recombination effect of conductive graphene.
This work reveals a novel manipulation mechanism of EIT resonance in the hybrid

$\beta$-function, which relates the $\beta$-function to the anomalous
dimensions of the quantum gauge superfield, of the Faddeev--Popov ghosts, and
of the chiral matter superfields. Namely, for the general renormalizable ${\cal
N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theory, regularized by higher covariant derivatives,
the sum of all three-loop contributions to the $\beta$-function containing the
Yukawa couplings is compared with the corresponding two-loop contributions to
the anomalous dimensions of the quantum superfields. It is demonstrated that
for the considered terms both new and original forms of the NSVZ relation are
valid independently of the subtraction scheme if the renormalization group
functions are defined in terms of the bare couplings. This result is obtained
from the equality relating the loop integrals, which, in turn, follows from the
factorization of the integrals for the $\beta$-function into integrals of
double total derivatives. For the renormalization group functions defined in
terms of the renormalized couplings we verify that the NSVZ scheme is obtained
with the higher covariant derivative regularization supplemented by the
subtraction scheme in which only powers of $\ln\Lambda/\mu$ are included into
the renormalization constants.

In the proposed method, temporal dependencies of the moving objects are
considered to make the clustering meaningful using Temporally Incremental

intuitive to estimate the model parameters. Further, we have extended TIGM
hierarchically as Dynamically Evolving Model (DEM) to represent notable traffic
dynamics of a scene. Experimental validation reveals that the proposed method
can learn a scene quickly without prior knowledge about the number of paths

have also highlighted the advantages of the proposed method over existing
techniques popularly used for designing traffic monitoring applications. It can
be used for administrative decision making to control traffic at junctions or

not all performance motions could be guided haptically for most instruments.
Our system breaks such restrictions using a semi-haptic interface. For the
first time, the pitch range of the haptically learned pieces goes beyond an

of $\gtrsim$ 100 $M_\odot$. Pair instability supernova (PISN) is a common fate
for such a massive star. Our final goal is to prove the existence of PISN and
thus the high mass nature of the initial mass function in the early universe by
conducting {\it abundance profiling}, in which properties of a hypothetical
first star is constrained by metal-poor star abundances. In order to determine
reliable and useful abundances, we investigate the PISN nucleosynthesis taking
both rotating and non-rotating progenitors for the first time. We show that the
initial and CO core mass ranges for PISNe depend on the envelope structures:
non-magnetic rotating models developing inflated envelopes have a lower-shifted
CO mass range of $\sim$ 70--125 $M_\odot$, while non-rotating and magnetic
rotating models with deflated envelopes have a range of $\sim$ 80--135
$M_\odot$. However, we find no significant difference in explosive yields from
rotating and non-rotating progenitors, except for large nitrogen production in
non-magnetic rotating models. Furthermore, we conduct the first systematic
comparison between theoretical yields and a large sample of metal-poor star
abundances. We find that the predicted low [Na/Mg] $\sim$ $-1.5$ and high
[Ca/Mg] $\sim$ $0.5$--$1.3$ abundance ratios are the most important to
discriminate PISN signatures from normal metal-poor star abundances, and
confirm that no currently observed metal-poor star matches with the PISN
abundance. Extensive discussion on the non-detection is finally made.

conventional perturbation theory in powers of the non-linear terms.
Unfortunately, this often produces divergent asymptotic series, collectively
dismissed by Abel as ""an invention of the devil."" An alternative method, the
self-consistent expansion (SCE), has been introduced by Schwartz and Edwards.
Its basic idea is a rescaling of the zeroth-order system around which the
solution is expanded, to achieve optimal results. While low-order SCEs have
been remarkably successful in describing the dynamics of non-equilibrium
many-body systems (e.g., the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation), its convergence
properties have not been elucidated before. To address this issue we apply this
technique to the canonical partition function of the classical harmonic
oscillator with a quartic $gx^{4}$ anharmonicity, for which perturbation
theory's divergence is well-known. We obtain the $N$th order SCE for the
partition function, which is rigorously found to converge exponentially fast in
$N$, and uniformly in $g\ge0$. We use our results to elucidate the relation
between the SCE and the class of approaches based on the so-called
""order-dependent mapping."" Moreover, we put the SCE to test against other
methods that improve upon perturbation theory (Borel resummation,
hyperasymptotics, Pad\'e approximants, and the Lanczos $\tau$-method), and find
that it compares favorably with all of them for small $g$ and dominates over
them for large $g$. The SCE is shown to successfully capture the correct
partition function for the double-well potential case, where no perturbative
expansion exists. Our treatment is generalized to the case of many oscillators,
as well as to any nonlinearity of the form $g|x|^{q}$ with $q\ge0$ and complex
$g$. These results allow us to treat the Airy function, and to see the
fingerprints of Stokes lines in the SCE.

the expression for the degenerate pressure and the total energy gets modified
accordingly. We discuss the number density and mass dependence of the

the SR limit. We then take the example of white dwarfs to explore the possible
implications. Using this modified degenerate pressure, we calculate the
possible modification to the Chandrashekhar limit for white dwarfs using the
Magueijo-Smolin (MS) modified dispersion relation. The mass-radius M-R plot
shows that the modified/corrected radius of the white dwarf can be greater
than, equal to and smaller than the usual special relativity (SR) value for
particular masses. We found that the Chandrasekhar mass limit gets a positive
correction. We note that the presence of observed white dwarfs having radius
smaller than the SR Chandrasekhar limit may find an explanation if they are
modeled using a modified dispersion relation. As the correction is perturbative
in the SR limit, therefore this correction is solely because of the modified
dispersion relation. The value of the obtained degenerate pressure for a given
mass is found to be greater than, equal to and smaller than the usual special
relativity (SR) value for particular masses as expected. We have also
calculated the luminosity of the white dwarf by taking the model of partially

self-adaptation approach for CNN training, utilizing both synthetic training

feeding real stereo pairs of different domains to stereo models pre-trained

well to the new domain, producing artifacts at boundaries and ill-posed
regions; however, ii) feeding an up-sampled stereo pair leads to a disparity
map with extra details. To avoid i) while exploiting ii), we formulate an
iterative optimization problem with graph Laplacian regularization. At each
iteration, the CNN adapts itself better to the new domain: we let the CNN learn
its own higher-resolution output; at the meanwhile, a graph Laplacian
regularization is imposed to discriminatively keep the desired edges while
smoothing out the artifacts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in

Computation (2018).
  The conceptual and methodological framework that underpins approximate
Bayesian computation (ABC) is targetted primarily towards problems in which the
likelihood is either challenging or missing. ABC uses a simulation-based
non-parametric estimate of the likelihood of a summary statistic and assumes
that the generation of data from the model is computationally cheap. This
chapter reviews two alternative approaches for estimating the intractable
likelihood, with the goal of reducing the necessary model simulations to
produce an approximate posterior. The first of these is a Bayesian version of
the synthetic likelihood (SL), initially developed by Wood (2010), which uses a
multivariate normal approximation to the summary statistic likelihood. Using
the parametric approximation as opposed to the non-parametric approximation of
ABC, it is possible to reduce the number of model simulations required. The
second likelihood approximation method we consider in this chapter is based on
the empirical likelihood (EL), which is a non-parametric technique and involves
maximising a likelihood constructed empirically under a set of moment
constraints. Mengersen et al (2013) adapt the EL framework so that it can be
used to form an approximate posterior for problems where ABC can be applied,
that is, for models with intractable likelihoods. However, unlike ABC and the
Bayesian SL (BSL), the Bayesian EL (BCel) approach can be used to completely
avoid model simulations in some cases. The BSL and BCel methods are illustrated
on models of varying complexity.

framework of the Peyrard-Bishop-Holstein model which has been widely used to
address charge dynamics in this macromolecule. To analyze these mechanisms we
consider characteristic size and time scales of the fluctuations of the
electronic and vibrational subsystems. It is shown, in particular, that due to
substantial differences in these timescales polaron formation is unlikely
within a broad range of temperatures. We demonstrate that at low temperatures
electronic transport can be quasi-ballistic. For high temperatures, we propose
an alternative to polaronic charge migration mechanism: the
fluctuation-assisted one, in which the electron dynamics is governed by
relatively slow fluctuations of the vibrational subsystem. We argue also that
the discussed methods and mechanisms can be relevant for other organic
macromolecular systems, such as conjugated polymers and molecular aggregates.

the Milky Way. These stars may have more precise distance estimates from
spectrophotometry than from Gaia parallaxes beyond 3 kpc. However, RC stars
have $T_{\rm eff}$ and log g very similar to some red giant branch (RGB) stars.
Especially for low-resolution spectroscopic studies where $T_{\rm eff}$, log g,
and [Fe/H] can only be estimated with limited precision, separating RC stars
from RGB through established method can incur ~20% contamination. Recently,
Hawkins et al. (2018) demonstrated that the additional information in
single-epoch spectra, such as the C/N ratio, can be exploited to cleanly
differentiate RC and RGB stars. In this second paper of the series, we
establish a data-driven mapping from spectral flux space to independently
determined asteroseismic parameters, the frequency and the period spacing. From
this, we identify 210,371 RC stars from the publicly available LAMOST DR3 and
APOGEE DR14 data, with ~9% of contamination. We provide an RC sample of 92,249
stars with a contamination of only ~3%, by restricting the combined analysis to
LAMOST stars with ${\rm S/N}_{\rm pix}$ > 75. This demonstrates that high-S/N,
low-resolution spectra covering a broad wavelength range can identify RC
samples at least as pristine as their high-resolution counterparts. As coming
and ongoing surveys such as TESS, DESI, and LAMOST will continue to improve the
overlapping training spectroscopic-asteroseismic sample, the method presented
in this study provides an efficient and straightforward way to derive a vast
yet pristine RC stars to reveal the 3D structure of the Milky Way.

property of cylindrical warp and a horizontal pixel selection strategy. The
proposed ratio-preserving half-cylindrical warp is a combination of homography
and cylindrical warps which guarantees alignment by homography and possesses
less projective distortion by cylindrical warp. Unlike previous approaches
applying cylindrical warp before homography, we use partition lines to divide
the image into different parts and apply homography in the overlapping region
while a composition of homography and cylindrical warps in the non-overlapping

reconstructs the image via interpolation to further reduce horizontal

half-cylindrical warp and horizontal pixel selection, the projective distortion
in vertical and horizontal is mitigated simultaneously. Experiments show that
our warp is efficient and produces a more natural-looking stitched result than

With such a combination, modifications in structural and optical properties do

Na+ ions behave as interstitial sites which enhance strain, lattice disorder
and thereby creating defects. Formation of interstitial defects leads to
reduction in bandgap energy and produce orange-red luminescence. For higher

opportunities: stereo-monocular fusion, stereo-ToF fusion and stereo-stereo

for computing maximum likelihood estimates from incomplete data. Despite its
numerous advantages, a main drawback of the EM algorithm is its frequently
observed slow convergence which often hinders the application of EM algorithms

for more rapidly convergent EM algorithms, we describe a new class of
acceleration schemes that build on the Anderson acceleration technique for
speeding fixed-point iterations. Our approach is effective at greatly
accelerating the convergence of EM algorithms and is automatically scalable to
high dimensional settings. Through the introduction of periodic algorithm
restarts and a damping factor, our acceleration scheme provides faster and more
robust convergence when compared to un-modified Anderson acceleration while
also improving global convergence. Crucially, our method works as an
""off-the-shelf"" method in that it may be directly used to accelerate any EM
algorithm without relying on the use of any model-specific features or
insights. Through a series of simulation studies involving five representative
problems, we show that our algorithm is substantially faster than the existing
state-of-art acceleration schemes.

is that we are lacking of control over the view update strategy to deal with
inherited ambiguity of view update for a given view.
  This vision paper aims to provide a new language-based approach to
controlling and integrating decentralized data based on the view, and establish
a software foundation for systematic construction of such data management
systems. Our key observation is that a view should be defined through a view
update strategy rather than a query. In other words, the view definition should
be extracted from the view update strategy, which is in sharp contrast to the
traditional approaches where the view update strategy is derived from the view
definition.
  In this paper, we present the first programmable architecture with a
declarative language for specifying update strategies over views, whose unique
view definition can be automatically derived, and show how it can be
effectively used to control data access, integrate data generally allowing
coexistence of GAV (global as view) and LAV (local as view), and perform both
analysis and updates on the integrated data. We demonstrate its usefulness

discuss its application scope, and highlight future challenges.

sets to control the conservativeness of the solutions. The associated lack of
interpretability and parameter specification procedures, as well as the high

challenging task. Existing rigid registration methods failed to use the
physical 3D uncertainty distribution of each point from a real sensor in the

static and invariant and it is hard to describe the change of these physical
uncertainty models in the registration process. Additionally, the existing
Gaussian mixture alignment architecture cannot be efficiently implement these

  This paper proposes a simple architecture combining error estimation from
sample covariances and dual dynamic global probability alignment using the
convolution of uncertainty-based Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) from point
clouds. Firstly, we propose an efficient way to describe the change of each 3D
uncertainty model, which represents the structure of the point cloud much
better. Unlike the invariant GMM (representing a fixed point cloud) in
traditional Gaussian mixture alignment, we use two uncertainty-based GMMs that
change and interact with each other in each iteration. In order to have a wider
basin of convergence than other local algorithms, we design a more robust
energy function by convolving efficiently the two GMMs over the whole 3D space.

in bilayer graphene [1,2]. The main factors, which may shed light on the
mechanism of the formation of this superconductivity, are the following.
Superconductivity is observed in bilayer graphene, when the two layers are
twisted, and the maximum of $T_c$ takes place at the ""magic angle"" of twist, at
which the electronic band structure becomes nearly flat. The same factors have
been suggested [3] to explain the experiments in graphite [4-8], which reported
high-T superconductivity in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). The
hints of room-T superconductivity are present, only when the sample contains
quasi two-dimensional interfaces between the domains of HOPG. These domains
should be twisted with respect to each other in order to form the flat band in
electronic spectrum. This dispersionless energy spectrum has a singular density
of states, which provides the transition temperature being proportional to the
coupling constant instead of the exponential suppression. The graphite and its
superconductivity is now becoming the mainstream. One may say that we are
coming to graphite era of superconductivity. It is time to combine the
theoretical and experimental efforts to reach the bulk room-T superconductivity

traditional empirically defined concepts, such as positions in space and time,
mass, energy, or momentum. Instead, the aim is to derive these concepts, and
their empirically determined relationships, from a more primitive model. It is
postulated that there exist things, which we call particles, that influence one
another in a discrete and directed fashion resulting in a partially ordered set
of influence events. We consider the problem of consistent quantification of
the influence events. Observers are modeled as particle chains (observer
chains) as if an observer were able to track a particle and quantify the
influence events that the particle experiences. From these quantified influence
events, we study consistent quantification of the universe of events based on
the observer chains. In this paper, we both review and further develop the
kinematics and dynamics of particles from the perspective of influence theory.

Relativity according to the most common definition of observables (0 Poisson
bracket with all first-class constraints). But other definitions have been
proposed. Seeking Hamiltonian-Lagrangian equivalence, Pons, Salisbury and
Sundermeyer use the Anderson-Bergmann-Castellani gauge generator G, a tuned sum
of first-class constraints. Kucha\v{r} waived the 0 Poisson bracket condition
for the Hamiltonian constraint to achieve changing observables. A systematic
combination of the two reforms might use the gauge generator but permit
non-zero Lie derivative Poisson brackets.
  One can test definitions by calculation using two formulations of a theory,
one without gauge freedom and one with it, which must have equivalent
observables. For de Broglie-Proca non-gauge massive electromagnetism, all
constraints are second-class, so everything is observable. Demanding equivalent
observables from gauge Stueckelberg-Utiyama electromagnetism, one finds that
the usual definition fails while the Pons-Salisbury-Sundermeyer definition with
G succeeds. This definition does not readily yield change in GR, however.
  Should GR's external gauge freedom of General Relativity share with internal
gauge symmetries the 0 Poisson bracket (invariance), or is covariance (a
transformation rule) sufficient? A graviton mass breaks the gauge symmetry
(general covariance), but it can be restored by parametrization with clock
fields. By requiring equivalent observables, one vindicates the Lie derivative
as the Poisson bracket of observables with the gauge generator G.

comprehensive. However, the social and environmental impacts are also immense
and far-reaching to its surrounding areas. Mapping land use /land cover changed
(LUCC) is critical for tracking the impacts. Remote sensing has been proved to
be an effective way to map and monitor land use change in real time and in
large areas such as the Three Gorges Reservoir Area(TGRA) by using pixel based
or oriented based classifier in different resolution. In this paper, we first
test the state of the art semantic segmentation deep learning classifiers for
LUCC mapping with 7 categories in the TGRA area with rapideye 5m resolution

mountain area. By compared with the pixel-based classifier, the semantic
segmentation deep learning method has better accuracy and robustness at 5m

Dynamic Depth Normal Images (DDNI) and Dynamic Depth Motion Normal Images

images are constructed from a segmented sequence of depth maps using
hierarchical bidirectional rank pooling to effectively capture the
spatial-temporal information. Specifically, DDI exploits the dynamics of
postures over time and DDNI and DDMNI exploit the 3D structural information
captured by depth maps. Upon the proposed representations, a ConvNet based
method is developed for action recognition. The image-based representations
enable us to fine-tune the existing Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet)
models trained on image data without training a large number of parameters from
scratch. The proposed method achieved the state-of-art results on three large
datasets, namely, the Large-scale Continuous Gesture Recognition Dataset (means
Jaccard index 0.4109), the Large-scale Isolated Gesture Recognition Dataset

some externally determined list. Being presented with a new point the algorithm
learns the comparability status of this new point to all previously presented
ones. As each point is received, the algorithm assigns this new point to a
chain in an irrevocable manner and this assignment is made without knowledge of
future points. Kierstead presented an algorithm using $(5^w-1)/4$ chains to
cover each poset of width $w$. Felsner proved that width $2$ posets can be
partitioned on-line into $5$ chains. We present an algorithm using $16$ chains
on posets of width $3$. This result significantly narrows down the previous
bound of $31$. Moreover, we address the on-line chain partitioning problem for
interval orders. Kierstead and Trotter presented an algorithm using $3w-2$
chains. We deal with an up-growing version of an on-line chain partition of
interval orders, i.e. we restrict possible inputs by the rule that each new
point is maximal at the moment of its arrival. We present an algorithm using
$2w-1$ chains and show that there is no better one. These problems come from a
need for better algorithms that can be applied to scheduling. Each on-line
chain partitioning algorithm schedules tasks in a multiprocessor environment,
and therefore can be applied in order to minimize number of processors.

  Wireless Powered Devices over Fading Channels","Single column, 31 pages",,,,"cs.IT cs.LG eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a promising technology that provides the
network a way to replenish the batteries of the remote devices by utilizing RF
transmissions. We study a class of harvest-first-transmit-later type of WPT
policy, where an access point (AP) first employs RF power transfer to recharge
a wireless powered device (WPD) for a certain period subjected to optimization,
and then, the harvested energy is subsequently used by the WPD to transmit its
data bits back to the AP over a finite horizon. A significant challenge
regarding the studied WPT scenario is the time-varying nature of the wireless
channel linking the WPD to the AP. We first investigate as a benchmark the
offline case where the channel realizations are known non-causally prior to the
starting of the horizon. For the offline case, by finding the optimal WPT
duration and power allocations in the data transmission period, we derive an
upper bound on the throughput of the WPD. We then focus on the online
counterpart of the problem where the channel realizations are known causally.
We prove that the optimal WPT duration obeys a time-dependent threshold form
depending on the energy state of the WPD. In the subsequent data transmission
stage, the optimal transmit power allocation for the WPD is shown to be of a
fractional structure where at each time slot a fraction of energy depending on
the current channel and a measure of future channel state expectations is
allocated for data transmission. We numerically show that the online policy
performs almost identical to the upper bound. We then consider a data sensing
application, where the WPD adjusts the sensing resolution to balance between
the quality of the sensed data and the probability of successfully delivering
it. We use Bayesian inference as a reinforcement learning method to provide a
mean for the WPD in learning to balance the sensing resolution.

increasingly popular in the field of precision medicine by providing a means
for comparing sequences of treatments tailored to the individual patient, i.e.,
dynamic treatment regime (DTR). The construction of evidence-based DTRs
promises a replacement to adhoc one-size-fits-all decisions pervasive in
patient care. However, there are substantial statistical challenges in sizing
SMART designs due to the complex correlation structure between the DTRs
embedded in the design. Since the primary goal of SMARTs is the construction of
an optimal DTR, investigators are interested in sizing SMARTs based on the
ability to screen out DTRs inferior to the optimal DTR by a given amount which
cannot be done using existing methods. In this paper, we fill this gap by
developing a rigorous power analysis framework that leverages multiple
comparisons with the best methodology. Our method employs Monte Carlo
simulation in order to compute the minimum number of individuals to enroll in
an arbitrary SMART. We will evaluate our method through extensive simulation
studies. We will illustrate our method by retrospectively computing the power
in the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone SMART study.

facilitates Bayesian inference and offers a convenient and interpretable
