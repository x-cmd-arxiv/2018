of information diffusion through a social network, and present insights while
considering various aspects. In particular, we focus on the independent cascade
model with the possibility of adaptively selecting seed nodes in multiple
phases based on the observed diffusion in preceding phases, and conduct a
detailed simulation study on real-world network datasets and various values of
seeding budgets. We first present a negative result that more phases do not
guarantee a better spread, however the adaptability advantage of more phases
generally leads to a better spread in practice, as observed on real-world
datasets. We study how diffusing in multiple phases affects the mean and
standard deviation of the distribution representing the extent of diffusion. We
then study how the number of phases impacts the effectiveness of multiphase
diffusion, how the diffusion progresses phase-by-phase, and what is an optimal
way to split the total seeding budget across phases. Our experiments suggest a
significant gain when we move from single phase to two phases, and an
appreciable gain when we further move to three phases, but the marginal gain
thereafter is usually not very significant. Our main conclusion is that, given
the number of phases, an optimal way to split the budget across phases is such
that the number of nodes influenced in each phase is almost the same.

nanostructured electronic devices, it greatly facilitates the manipulation of
mechanical resonators in the quantum regime, and could unveil a new route in
quantum communications using phonons as carriers of information. Acoustic
phonons also constitute a versatile platform for the study of fundamental wave
dynamics, including Bloch oscillations, Wannier Stark ladders and other
localization phenomena. Many of the phenomena studied in nanophononics were
indeed inspired by their counterparts in optics and electronics. In these
fields, the consideration of topological invariants to control wave dynamics
has already had a great impact for the generation of robust confined states.
Interestingly, the use of topological phases to engineer nanophononic devices
remains an unexplored and promising field. Conversely, the use of acoustic
phonons could constitute a rich platform to study topological states. Here, we
introduce the concept of topological invariants to nanophononics and
experimentally implement a nanophononic system supporting a robust topological
interface state at 350 GHz. The state is constructed through band inversion,
i.e. by concatenating two semiconductor superlattices with inverted spatial
mode symmetries. The existence of this state is purely determined by the Zak
phases of the constituent superlattices, i.e. that one-dimensional Berry phase.
We experimentally evidenced the mode through Raman spectroscopy. The reported
robust topological interface states could become part of nanophononic devices
requiring resonant structures such as sensors or phonon lasers.

coniferous/deciduous classification of individual trees from airborne LiDAR
data. To enable efficient processing by a deep convolutional neural network
(CNN), we designed two discrete representations using leaf-off and leaf-on
LiDAR data: a digital surface model with four channels (DSMx4) and a set of
four 2D views (4x2D). A training dataset of labeled tree crowns was generated
via segmentation of tree crowns, followed by co-registration with field data.
Potential mislabels due to GPS error or tree leaning were corrected using a
statistical ensemble filtering procedure. Because the training data was heavily
unbalanced (~8% conifers), we trained an ensemble of CNNs on random balanced
sub-samples of augmented data (180 rotational variations per instance). The
4x2D representation yielded similar classification accuracies to the DSMx4
representation (~82% coniferous and ~90% deciduous) while converging faster.
The data augmentation improved the classification accuracies, but more real
training instances (especially coniferous) likely results in much stronger
improvements. Leaf-off LiDAR data were the primary source of useful
information, which is likely due to the perennial nature of coniferous foliage.
LiDAR intensity values also proved to be useful, but normalization yielded no
significant improvements. Lastly, the classification accuracies of overstory
trees (~90%) were more balanced than those of understory trees (~90% deciduous
and ~65% coniferous), which is likely due to the incomplete capture of
understory tree crowns via airborne LiDAR. Automatic derivation of optimal
features via deep learning provide the opportunity for remarkable improvements
in prediction tasks where captured data are not friendly to human visual system
- likely yielding sub-optimal human-designed features.

we analyze the model order reduction of the local harmonic extension basis and
prove its convergence in the energy norm. These theoretical findings shed
insights into the mechanism behind the efficiency of the GMsFEMs.

different frequencies using a double-$\Lambda$ system pumped by a bi-frequency
field. The Raman lasers are phase-locked to one another, and the beat-frequency
matches the energy difference between the two meta-stable ground states. Akin
to a conventional Raman laser, the phase-locked Raman laser pair is expected to
be subluminal. As such, it is expected to be highly stable against
perturbations in cavity length, and have a quantum noise limited linewidth that
is far below that of a conventional laser. Because of these properties, the
phase-locked Raman laser pair may find important applications in precision
metrology, including atomic interferometry and magnetometry. To elucidate the
behavior of this laser pair, we develop an analytical model that describes the
stimulated Raman interaction in a double-$\Lambda$ system using an effective
2-level transition. The approximation is valid as long as the excited states
adiabatically follow the ground states, as verified by numerical simulations.
The effective model is used to identify the optimal operating conditions for
the bi-frequency Raman lasing process. This model may also prove useful in
other potential applications of the double-$\Lambda$ system, including
generation of squeezed light and spatial solitons.

  There is a natural system of linear equations whose nonnegative integer

real solutions to this system are called fractional isomorphisms, and two
graphs are fractionally isomorphic if and only if the color refinement
algorithm cannot distinguish them (Tinhofer 1986, 1991). We show that, if we

  We lift the results for trees to an equivalence between numbers of
homomorphisms from graphs of tree width k, the k-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman
algorithm, and the level-k Sherali-Adams relaxation of our linear program. We
also obtain a partial result for graphs of bounded path width and solutions to

construct a unifying framework for the gravitational and electromagnetic
interaction and wave mechanics. Using a sort of ""general relativistic quantum
mechanics"" Rosenfeld introduced a wave equation on a curved background. He
investigated the metric created by what he called `quantum phenomena',
represented by wave functions. Rosenfeld integrated Einstein equations in the
weak field limit, with wave functions as source of the gravitational field. The

order the Reissner-Nordstr\""om metric. We analyse how Rosenfeld's work is part

The global parameters of flares, such as the total energy released, duration,
physical size, etc., are routinely measured, and the hydrodynamics of a coronal
loop subjected to intense heating have been extensively studied. It is not
clear, however, how many loops comprise a flare, nor how the total energy is
partitioned between them. In this work, we employ a hydrodynamic model to
better understand the energy partition by synthesizing Si IV and Fe XXI line
emission and comparing to observations of these lines with IRIS. We find that
the observed temporal evolution of the Doppler shifts holds important
information on the heating duration. To demonstrate this we first examine a
single loop model, and find that the properties of chromospheric evaporation
seen in Fe XXI can be reproduced by loops heated for long durations, while
persistent red-shifts seen in Si IV cannot be reproduced by any single loop
model. We then examine a multi-threaded model, assuming both a fixed heating
duration on all loops, and a distribution of heating durations. For a fixed
heating duration, we find that durations of 100 -- 200 s do a fair job of
reproducing both the red- and blue-shifts, while a distribution of durations,
with a median of about 50 -- 100 s, does a better job. Finally, we compare our
simulations directly to observations of an M-class flare seen by IRIS, and find
good agreement between the modeled and observed values given these constraints.

learning of graph embeddings has benefited from the information contained in
random walks. In this paper, we propose a model: Network of GCNs (N-GCN), which
marries these two lines of work. At its core, N-GCN trains multiple instances
of GCNs over node pairs discovered at different distances in random walks, and
learns a combination of the instance outputs which optimizes the classification
objective. Our experiments show that our proposed N-GCN model improves
state-of-the-art baselines on all of the challenging node classification tasks
we consider: Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, and PPI. In addition, our proposed method
has other desirable properties, including generalization to recently proposed
semi-supervised learning methods such as GraphSAGE, allowing us to propose
N-SAGE, and resilience to adversarial input perturbations.

black hole, so that stars move on nearly Keplerian orbits and the total
potential is almost stationary in time. Yet, the deviations of the potential
from the Keplerian one, due to the enclosed stellar mass and general
relativity, will cause the stellar orbits to precess. Moreover, as a result of
the finite number of stars, small deviations of the potential from spherical
symmetry induce residual torques that can change the stars' angular momentum
faster than the standard two-body relaxation. The combination of these two
effects drives a stochastic evolution of orbital angular momentum, a process
named ""resonant relaxation"". Owing to recent developments in the description of
the relaxation of self-gravitating systems, we can now fully describe scalar
resonant relaxation (relaxation of the magnitude of the angular momentum) as a
diffusion process. In this framework, the potential fluctuations due to the
complex orbital motion of the stars are described by a random correlated noise,
whose statistical properties are fully characterized by the stars' mean field
motion. On long timescales, the cluster can be regarded as a diffusive system,
whose diffusion coefficients depend explicitly on the mean field stellar
distribution through the properties of the noise. We show here, for the first
time, how the diffusion coefficients of scalar resonant relaxation, for a
spherically symmetric system, can be fully calculated from first principles,
without any free parameters. We also provide an open source code that evaluates
these diffusion coefficients numerically.

converges locally and superlinearly to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points.
Computational complexity analysis shows that the cost of the SSN algorithm per

weaker than the Lipschitz Hessian property and allows us to show faster
convergence bounds for a much larger class of distributions than would be
possible with the usual Lipschitz Hessian constant alone. Important
distributions that satisfy our regularity condition include posterior
distributions used in Bayesian logistic regression for which the data satisfies
an ""incoherence"" property. Our result compares favorably with the best
available bounds for the class of strongly log-concave distributions, which
grow like $d^{{1}/{2}}$ gradient evaluations with the dimension. Moreover, our
simulations on synthetic data suggest that, when our regularity condition is
satisfied, leapfrog HMC performs better than its competitors -- both in terms
of accuracy and in terms of the number of gradient evaluations it requires.

models for thermosphere are either physics-based or empirical. Physics-based
models offer the potential for good predictive/forecast capabilities but
require dedicated parallel resources for real-time evaluation and data
assimilative capabilities that have yet to be developed. Empirical models are
fast to evaluate, but offer very limited forecasting abilities. This paper
presents a methodology of developing a reduced-order dynamic model from

behavior. This work develops a quasi-physical reduced order model (ROM) for
thermospheric mass density using simulated output from NCAR's

ROM is derived using a dynamic system formulation from a large dataset of

Towards this end, a new reduced order modeling approach, based on Dynamic Mode
Decomposition with control (DMDc), that uses the Hermitian space of the problem
to derive the dynamics and input matrices in a tractable manner is developed.
Results show that the ROM performs well in serving as a reduced order surrogate
for TIE-GCM while almost always maintaining the forecast error to within 5\% of
the simulated densities after 24 hours.

circumstances during its next apparition followed by a close encounter with
Jupiter in 1779. Since then, the fate of D/Lexell has attracted interest from
the scientific community, and now we revisit this long-standing question. We
investigate the dynamical evolution of D/Lexell based on a set of orbits
recalculated using the observations made by Charles Messier, the comet's
discoverer, and find that there is a $98\%$ chance that D/Lexell remains in the

non-gravitational effect is imposed. Messier's observations also suggest that
the comet is one of the largest known near-Earth comets, with a nucleus of
$\gtrsim 10$ km in diameter. This implies that the comet should have been
detected by contemporary NEO surveys regardless of its activity level if it has
remained in the inner Solar System. We identify asteroid 2010 JL$_{33}$ as a
possible descendant of D/Lexell, with a $0.8\%$ probability of chance
alignment, but a direct orbital linkage of the two bodies has not been
successfully accomplished. We also use the recalculated orbit to investigate
the meteors potentially originating from D/Lexell. While no associated meteors
have been unambiguously detected, we show that meteor observations can be used
to better constrain the orbit of D/Lexell despite the comet being long lost.

privacy implications of machine learning models trained on sensitive data, such
as medical records or other personal information. To address those concerns,
one promising approach is Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles, or PATE,
which transfers to a ""student"" model the knowledge of an ensemble of ""teacher""
models, with intuitive privacy provided by training teachers on disjoint data
and strong privacy guaranteed by noisy aggregation of teachers' answers.
However, PATE has so far been evaluated only on simple classification tasks
like MNIST, leaving unclear its utility when applied to larger-scale learning
tasks and real-world datasets.
  In this work, we show how PATE can scale to learning tasks with large numbers
of output classes and uncurated, imbalanced training data with errors. For
this, we introduce new noisy aggregation mechanisms for teacher ensembles that
are more selective and add less noise, and prove their tighter
differential-privacy guarantees. Our new mechanisms build on two insights: the
chance of teacher consensus is increased by using more concentrated noise and,
lacking consensus, no answer need be given to a student. The consensus answers
used are more likely to be correct, offer better intuitive privacy, and incur
lower-differential privacy cost. Our evaluation shows our mechanisms improve on

to recover the images from highly undersampled measurements. A computationally
efficient algorithm, which relies on the bandlimited approximation of the

demonstrated on several patients with different breathing patterns and cardiac

free-breathing and ungated data, providing reconstructions that are
qualitatively similar to breath-held scans performed on the same patients. This

QSO field, LAEs and LBGs are clustering in 4-20 comoving Mpc angular scales,

mitigation techniques available to the user. However, while attackers often
abandon one form of exploitation in favor of a more lucrative one, mitigation
techniques are rarely abandoned. Mitigations are rarely retired or disabled
since proving they have outlived their usefulness is often impossible. As a
result, performance overheads, maintenance costs, and false positive rates
induced by the different mitigations accumulate, culminating in an outdated,
inefficient, and costly security solution.
  We advocate for a new kind of tunable framework on which to base security
mechanisms. This new framework enables a more reactive approach to security
allowing us to optimize the deployment of security mechanisms based on the
current state of attacks. Based on actual evidence of exploitation collected
from the field, our framework can choose which mechanisms to enable/disable so
that we can minimize the overall costs and false positive rates while
maintaining a satisfactory level of security in the system.
  We use real-world Snort signatures to simulate the benefits of reactively
disabling signatures when no evidence of exploitation is observed and compare
them to the costs of the current state of deployment. Additionally, we evaluate
the responsiveness of our framework and show that in case disabling a security
mechanism triggers a reappearance of an attack we can respond in time to
prevent mass exploitation.
  Through large-scale simulations that use integer linear and Bayesian solvers,
we discover that our responsive strategy is both computationally affordable and
results in significant reductions in false positives (~20% over traces that are
about 9 years long), at the cost of introducing a moderate number of false
negatives. Finding the optimal sampling strategy takes less than 2.5 minutes in
the vast majority of cases.

often possible to reverse engineer a circuit function by combining a
camouflaged circuit model and the ability to have oracle access to the
obfuscated combinational circuit. Especially in small circuits it is easy to
reverse engineer the circuit function in this way, but SAT-based reverse
engineering techniques provide no guarantees of recovering a circuit that is
gate-by-gate equivalent to the original design. In this work we show that an
attacker who does not know gate functions or connections of an aggressively
camouflaged circuit cannot learn the correct gate-level schematic even if able
to control inputs and probe all combinational nodes of the circuit. We then
present a stronger attack that extends SAT-based reverse engineering with fault
analysis to allow an attacker to recover the correct gate-level schematic. We
analyze our reverse engineering approach on an S-Box circuit.

for expert labeling. Deep learning was able to infer perfusion of
microvasculature from structural OCT images with similar fidelity to OCTA and
significantly better than expert clinicians (P < 0.00001). OCTA suffers from
need of specialized hardware, laborious acquisition protocols, and motion

applications, including array bounds checking and resource usage estimation.
However, designing a scalable numeric static analysis for real-world Java
programs presents a multitude of design choices, each of which may interact
with others. For example, an analysis could handle method calls via either a
top-down or bottom-up interprocedural analysis. Moreover, this choice could
interact with how we choose to represent aliasing in the heap and/or whether we
use a relational numeric domain, e.g., convex polyhedra. In this paper, we
present a family of abstract interpretation-based numeric static analyses for
Java and systematically evaluate the impact of 162 analysis configurations on
the DaCapo benchmark suite. Our experiment considered the precision and
performance of the analyses for discharging array bounds checks. We found that
top-down analysis is generally a better choice than bottom-up analysis, and
that using access paths to describe heap objects is better than using summary
objects corresponding to points-to analysis locations. Moreover, these two
choices are the most significant, while choices about the numeric domain,
representation of abstract objects, and context-sensitivity make much less
difference to the precision/performance tradeoff.

applications laboratory (eCal) that developed a model for price prediction of
the energy day-ahead market (DAM) and a stochastic load scheduling for
distributed energy resources (DER) with DAM based objective\cite{Travacca}. In
similar fashion to the work of Travacca et al., in this project we take the
standpoint of a DER aggregator pooling a large number of electricity consumers
- each of which have an electric vehicle and solar PV panels - to bid their
pooled energy resources into the electricity markets. The primary contribution
of this project is the optimization of an aggregated load schedule for
participation in the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) real time
(15-minute) electricity market. The goal of the aggregator is to optimally
manage its pool of resources, particularly the flexible resources, in order to
minimize its cost in the real time market. We achieves this through the use of
a model predictive control scheme. A critical difference between the prior work
in \cite{Travacca} is that the structure of the optimization problem is
drastically different. Based upon our review of the current and public
literature, no similar approaches exist. The main objective of this project
were building methods. Nevertheless, to illustrate a simulation with 100
prosumers was realized. The results should therefore be taken with a grain of
salt. We find that the Real Time operation does not substantially decrease or
increase the total cost the aggregator faces in the RT market, but this is
probably due to parameters that need further tuning and data, that need better
processing.

particularly important. There will be two types of Calabi-Yau structures in the
setting of ring spectra: one that applies to compact algebras and one that
applies to smooth algebras. The main application of twisted compact Calabi-Yau
ring spectra that we will study is to describe, prove, and explain a certain
duality phenomenon in string topology. This is a duality between the manifold
string topology of Chas-Sullivan and the Lie group string topology of
Chataur-Menichi. This will extend and generalize work of Gruher. Then,
generalizing work of the first author and Jones, we show how the gauge group of
the principal bundle acts on this compact Calabi-Yau structure, and compute
some explicit examples. We then extend the notion of the Calabi-Yau structure
to smooth ring spectra, and prove that Thom ring spectra of (virtual) bundles
over the loop space, $\Omega M$, have this structure. In the case when $M$ is a
sphere we will use these twisted smooth Calabi-Yau ring spectra to study
Lagrangian immersions of the sphere into its cotangent bundle. We recast the
work of Abouzaid-Kragh to show that the topological Hochschild homology of the
Thom ring spectrum induced by the $h$-principle classifying map of the
Lagrangian immersion, detects whether that immersion can be Lagrangian isotopic
to an embedding. We then compute some examples. Finally, we interpret these
Calabi-Yau structures directly in terms of topological Hochschild homology and
cohomology.

from seismological imaging combined with geodetic modeling may form the basis

the structural complexity of faults and shear zones in numerical models of

techniques for high-precision models of deformation and stress around both
curvilinear faults and volumes undergoing anelastic (irreversible) strain in a
heterogenous elastic half-space. To that end, we enhance the software Gamra to
model triangular and rectangular fault patches and tetrahedral and cuboidal

can be roughly classified into two categories. The first category treats scene
text as a type of general objects and follows general object detection paradigm
to localize scene text by regressing the text box locations, but troubled by
the arbitrary-orientation and large aspect ratios of scene text. The second one
segments text regions directly, but mostly needs complex post processing. In
this paper, we present a method that combines the ideas of the two types of
methods while avoiding their shortcomings. We propose to detect scene text by
localizing corner points of text bounding boxes and segmenting text regions in
relative positions. In inference stage, candidate boxes are generated by
sampling and grouping corner points, which are further scored by segmentation
maps and suppressed by NMS. Compared with previous methods, our method can
handle long oriented text naturally and doesn't need complex post processing.
The experiments on ICDAR2013, ICDAR2015, MSRA-TD500, MLT and COCO-Text
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves better or comparable results
in both accuracy and efficiency. Based on VGG16, it achieves an F-measure of

from noisy segments with unknown positions of the observation windows. One
example arises in DNA sequence assembly, which is typically solved by matching
short reads to form longer sequences. Instead of trying to locate the segment

formulate the problem as a constrained nonlinear least-squares. The

Type Ia supernova (SC-SN), have been studied through detailed three dimensional
radiation transfer simulations. With the detected near-infrared excess from SN
2012dn, we show that it has a disk-like dusty CS environment whose mass is
roughly consistent with a branch of an accreting white dwarf system (the single
degenerate scenario). We show that a similar system should produce polarization
signals up to $\sim 8$ \% in the $B$ band, depending on the viewing direction
if polarimetric observation is performed. We predict that the maximum
polarization is reached around $\sim 60$ days after the $B$-band maximum. We
show that the temporal and wavelength dependence of the polarization signals,
together with other unique features, can be easily distinguished from the
interstellar polarization and intrinsic SN polarization. Indeed, the small
polarization degree observed for normal Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) can constrain a
parameter space in the CS dust mass and distribution. We thus encourage
multi-band polarimetric observations for SNe Ia, especially for outliers
including SC-SNe for which some arguments for the single degenerate scenario
exist but the polarization data are very rare so far.

of the robot is, for example, relevant for navigation, manipulation, or
planning. Semantic segmentation labels each pixel of an image with a class
label and thus provides a detailed semantic annotation of the surroundings to
the robot. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are popular methods for
addressing this type of problem. The available software for training and the
integration of CNNs for real robots, however, is quite fragmented and often
difficult to use for non-experts, despite the availability of several
high-quality open-source frameworks for neural network implementation and
training. In this paper, we propose a tool called Bonnet, which addresses this
fragmentation problem by building a higher abstraction that is specific for the
semantic segmentation task. It provides a modular approach to simplify the
training of a semantic segmentation CNN independently of the used dataset and
the intended task. Furthermore, we also address the deployment on a real

approachable in the context of autonomous systems. In this sense, we aim at
closing a gap between computer vision research and its use in robotics
research. We provide an open-source codebase for training and deployment. The
training interface is implemented in Python using TensorFlow and the deployment
interface provides a C++ library that can be easily integrated in an existing
robotics codebase, a ROS node, and two standalone applications for label
prediction in images and videos.

accelerate the convergence of the steady state flow on unstructured grids. The
dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) technique is used to analyze the convergence
process of steady flow field according to the solution vectors from the
previous time steps. Unlike the traditional multigrid method, we project the
flowfield solutions from the physical space into the modal space, and truncate
all the high-frequency modes but only the first-order mode are retained based
on the DMD analysis. The real solutions in the physical space can be obtained
simply by the inverse transformation from the modal space. The developed MMG
method ingeniously avoids the complicated process of coarsening computational
mesh, and does not need to make any change for the grid in physical space.
Therefore, it is very convenient to be applied to any numerical schemes with
just little change for the flow solver, which is also suitable for unstructured
grids and easy for parallel computing. Several typical test cases have been
used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, which demonstrates
that the MMG can dramatically reduce the number of iterative steps for the
different mesh types, different accuracy of spatial discretization and
different time-marching schemes. The method is 3 to 6 times faster than the
original method while ensuring the computational accuracy.

have the potential to improve our health, user engagement and retention are
critical factors for their success. However, long-term user engagement patterns
in real-world activity tracking applications are not yet well understood. Here
we study user engagement patterns within a mobile physical activity tracking
application consisting of 115 million logged activities taken by over a million
users over 31 months. Specifically, we show that over 75% of users return and
re-engage with the application after prolonged periods of inactivity, no matter
the duration of the inactivity. We find a surprising result that the
re-engagement usage patterns resemble those of the start of the initial
engagement period, rather than being a simple continuation of the end of the
initial engagement period. This evidence points to a conceptual model of
multiple lives of user engagement, extending the prevalent single life view of
user activity. We demonstrate that these multiple lives occur because the users
have a variety of different primary intents or goals for using the app. We find
evidence for users being more likely to stop using the app once they achieved
their primary intent or goal (e.g., weight loss). However, these users might
return once their original intent resurfaces (e.g., wanting to lose newly
gained weight). Based on insights developed in this work, including a marker of
improved primary intent performance, our prediction models achieve 71% ROC AUC.
Overall, our research has implications for modeling user re-engagement in
health activity tracking applications and has consequences for how
notifications, recommendations as well as gamification can be used to increase
engagement.

relationship management. A mass of work exists in which machine learning models
or business rules are established to predict churn. However, targeting users at
an early stage when they start to show a downward trend is a better strategy.
In downward trend prediction, the reasons why customers show a downward trend
is of great interest in the industry as it helps the business to understand the
pain points that customers suffer and to take early action to prevent them from
churning. A commonly used method is to collect feedback from customers by
either aggressively reaching out to them or by passively hearing from them.
However, it is believed that there are a large number of customers who have
unpleasant experiences and never speak out. In the literature, there is limited
research work that provides a comprehensive and scientific approach to identify
these ""silent suffers"". In this study, we propose a novel two-part framework:
developing the downward prediction process and establishing the methodology to
identify the reasons why customers are in the downward trend. In the first
prediction part, we focus on predicting the downward trend, which is an earlier
stage of the customer lifecycle compared to churn. In the second part, we
propose an approach to figuring out the cause (of the downward trend) based on
a causal inference method and semi-supervised learning. The proposed approach
is capable of identifying potential silent sufferers. We take bad shopping
experiences as inputs to develop the framework and validate it via a marketing
A/B test in the real world. The test readout demonstrates the effectiveness of
the framework by driving 88.5% incremental lift in purchase volume.

in the two dimensional plane decay, as time goes to infinity, provided the

sub-critical case this decay can be resolved by a steady, self-similar

system of several interacting populations, under the existence of an additional
drift for each component which decays in time at the rate $O(1/\sqrt{t})$. We
show that self-similar solutions always exists in the sub-critical case, while
the existence of such self-similar solution in the critical case depends on the
gap between the decaying drifts for each of the components. For this, we study
the conditions for existence/non existence of solutions for the corresponding

distribution algorithm (EDA) possesses unique characteristics and has been
widely applied to global optimization. However, the common-used Gaussian EDA
(GEDA) usually suffers from premature convergence which severely limits its
search efficiency. This study first systematically analyses the reasons for the
deficiency of the traditional GEDA, then tries to enhance its performance by
exploiting its evolution direction, and finally develops a new GEDA variant
named EDA2. Instead of only utilizing some good solutions produced in the
current generation when estimating the Gaussian model, EDA2 preserves a certain
number of high-quality solutions generated in previous generations into an
archive and takes advantage of these historical solutions to assist estimating
the covariance matrix of Gaussian model. By this means, the evolution direction
information hidden in the archive is naturally integrated into the estimated
model which in turn can guide EDA2 towards more promising solution regions.
Moreover, the new estimation method significantly reduces the population size
of EDA2 since it needs fewer individuals in the current population for model
estimation. As a result, a fast convergence can be achieved. To verify the
efficiency of EDA2, we tested it on a variety of benchmark functions and
compared it with several state-of-the-art EAs, including IPOP-CMAES, AMaLGaM,
three high-powered DE algorithms, and a new PSO algorithm. The experimental
results demonstrate that EDA2 is efficient and competitive.

Previous results showed that the formation of system-environment bound state
governs the quantum speedup. Although a stronger bound state in the
system-environment spectrum may seem like it should cause greater speed of
evolution, this seemingly intuitive thinking may not always be correct. We
illustrate this by investigating a qubit driven by a classical field and
coupled to a photonic crystal waveguide in the presence of a mirror. The
perfect mirror can force part of the emitted light to return back to the qubit,
and thus induce non-Markovian dynamics. Within the considered model, we show
how the evolution speed is influenced by the memory time and the classical
driving strength. In particular, we find that the formation of bound state is
not the essential reason for the acceleration of evolution. The quantum speedup
is attributed to the flow of information, regardless of the direction in which
the information flows. Our conclusion can also be used to other non-Markovian
environments.

social choice, scheduling, etc., were achieved by applying the theory of
so-called $n$-fold integer programming. An $n$-fold integer program (IP) has a
highly uniform block structured constraint matrix. Hemmecke, Onn, and Romanchuk
[Math. Programming, 2013] showed an algorithm with runtime $a^{O(rst + r^2s)}
n^3$, where $a$ is the largest coefficient, $r,s$, and $t$ are dimensions of
blocks of the constraint matrix and $n$ is the total dimension of the IP; thus,
an algorithm efficient if the blocks are of small size and with small
coefficients. The algorithm works by iteratively improving a feasible solution
with augmenting steps, and $n$-fold IPs have the special property that
augmenting steps are guaranteed to exist in a not-too-large neighborhood.
  We have implemented the algorithm and learned the following along the way.
The original algorithm is practically unusable, but we discover a series of
improvements which make its evaluation possible. Crucially, we observe that a
certain constant in the algorithm can be treated as a tuning parameter, which
yields an efficient heuristic (essentially searching in a
smaller-than-guaranteed neighborhood). Furthermore, the algorithm uses an
overly expensive strategy to find a ""best"" step, while finding only an
""approximatelly best"" step is much cheaper, yet sufficient for quick
convergence. Using this insight, we improve the asymptotic dependence on $n$
from $n^3$ to $n^2 \log n$.
  We show that decreasing the tuning parameter initially leads to an increased
number of iterations needed for convergence and eventually to getting stuck in
local optima, as expected. However, surprisingly small values of the parameter
already exhibit good behavior. Second, our new strategy for finding
""approximatelly best"" steps wildly outperforms the original construction.

\chi_{c1}K(\pi)$ in the conventional perturbative QCD (PQCD) formalism. The
predictions of branching ratios and $CP$ asymmetries are given in detail. We
compare our results with available experimental data as well as predictions of
other theoretical studies existing in the literature. It seems that the
branching ratios of $B\rightarrow \chi_{c1} K$ are more consistent with data
than the earlier analyses. For the Cabibbo-suppressed $B_s$ decay, the
branching ratio can reach the order of $10^{-5}$, which would be straight
forward for experimental observations. The numerical results show that the
direct $CP$ asymmetries of the concerned decays are rather small. The
mixing-induced $CP$ asymmetry in the $B^0\rightarrow \chi_{c1}K_S$ is very
close to $\sin{2\beta}$, which suggests that this channel offer an alternative
method for measuring the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) angle $\beta$. The
obtained results in the present work could be tested by further experiments in
the LHCb and forthcoming Belle II.

of Hermitian matrices. As the role played by Hermitian matrices in matrix
theory and quadratic optimization, CPS tensors have shown growing interest
recently in tensor theory and optimization, particularly in many
application-driven complex polynomial optimization problems. In this paper, we
study CPS tensors with a focus on ranks, rank-one decompositions and
approximations, as well as their applications. The analysis is conducted along
side with a more general class of complex tensors called partial-symmetric
tensors. We prove constructively that any CPS tensor can be decomposed into a
sum of rank-one CPS tensors, which provides an alternative definition of CPS
tensors via linear combinations of rank-one CPS tensors. Three types of ranks
for CPS tensors are defined and shown to be different in general. This leads to
the invalidity of the conjugate version of Comon's conjecture. We then study
rank-one approximations and matricizations of CPS tensors. By carefully
unfolding CPS tensors to Hermitian matrices, rank-one equivalence can be
preserved. This enables us to develop new convex optimization models and
algorithms to compute best rank-one approximation of CPS tensors. Numerical
experiments from various data are performed to justify the capability of our
methods.

  structures","36 pages, 11 figures",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A hypergraph $(V,E)$ is called an interval hypergraph if there exists a
linear order $l$ on $V$ such that every edge $e\in E$ is an interval w.r.t.
$l$; we also assume that $\{j\}\in E$ for every $j\in V$. Our main result is a
de Finetti-type representation of random exchangeable interval hypergraphs on
$\mathbb{N}$ (EIHs): the law of every EIH can be obtained by sampling from some
random compact subset $K$ of the triangle $\{(x,y):0\leq x\leq y\leq 1\}$ at
iid uniform positions $U_1,U_2,\dots$, in the sense that, restricted to the
node set $[n]:=\{1,\dots,n\}$ every non-singleton edge is of the form
$e=\{i\in[n]:x<U_i<y\}$ for some $(x,y)\in K$. We obtain this result via the
study of a related class of stochastic objects: erased-interval processes
(EIPs). These are certain transient Markov chains
$(I_n,\eta_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ such that $I_n$ is an interval hypergraph on
$V=[n]$ w.r.t. the usual linear order (called interval system). We present an
almost sure representation result for EIPs. Attached to each transient Markov
chain is the notion of Martin boundary. The points in the boundary attached to
EIPs can be seen as limits of growing interval systems. We obtain a one-to-one
correspondence between these limits and compact subsets $K$ of the triangle
with $(x,x)\in K$ for all $x\in[0,1]$. Interval hypergraphs are a
generalizations of hierarchies and as a consequence we obtain a representation
result for exchangeable hierarchies, which is close to a result of Forman,
Haulk and Pitman. Several ordered discrete structures can be seen as interval
systems with additional properties, i.e. Schr\""oder trees and binary trees. We
describe limits of Schr\""oder trees as certain tree-like compact sets.
Considering binary trees we thus obtain a homeomorphic description of the
Martin boundary of R\'emy's tree growth chain, which has been analyzed by

partial miscibility between multiple fluids. We prove a novel relation among
the pressure, temperature and chemical potentials, which results in a new
formulation of the momentum conservation equation indicating that the gradients
of chemical potentials and temperature become the primary driving force of the
fluid motion except for the external forces. A key challenge in numerical
simulation is to develop entropy stable numerical schemes preserving the laws
of thermodynamics. Based on the convex-concave splitting of Helmholtz free
energy density with respect to molar densities and temperature, we propose an
entropy stable numerical method, which solves the total energy balance equation
directly, and thus, naturally satisfies the first law of thermodynamics.
Unconditional entropy stability (the second law of thermodynamics) of the
proposed method is proved by estimating the variations of Helmholtz free energy
and kinetic energy with time steps. Numerical results validate the proposed
method.

The aim of the technique is to realize viable inflationary scenarios, and the
only assumption that must hold true in order for the reconstruction technique
to work is that the dynamical evolution of the scalar field obeys the slow-roll

expansion quantified by the parameter $\rho_c$, which is the critical density
of the quantum theory. Finally, by using the formalism of slow-roll

chain in dilute solution is formulated. We give a detailed analytical
expression for the end-to-end distance auto-correlation function of a long
chain polymer in solution. The physical problem of dynamics of end-to-end
distance can be modeled mathematically with the use of a Smoluchowski-like
equation. Using this equation analytical expression for end-to-end distance
auto-correlation function is derived. We find that this auto-correlation
function varies with several parameters such as length of the polymer (N), bond
length (b) and the relaxation time ${\tau_R}$.

meteorites of non-igneous composition, primarily of sedimentary origin,
distinct from SNC meteorites. The paper reviews evidence on putative
sedimentary-origin meteorites and potential parent bodies for sedimentary
meteorites. Authors conclude that the list of candidate parent bodies for
sedimentary meteorites includes, but is not limited by the Earth, Mars,
Enceladus, Ganymede, Europa, and hypothetical planets that could exist between
orbits of Mars and Jupiter in the past. Authors argue that extraterrestrial
origin and a parent body for meteoritic sedimentary rocks may be identified
based on the entire body of evidence which is not limited solely by tests of
oxygen and noble gas isotopes whose signatures may undergo terrestrial
contamination and may exhibit significant heterogeneity within the Solar system
and within the parent cosmic bodies. Observed fall of a cosmic body, evidence
of hypervelocity fall, signs of impact in target, and the presence of fusion
crust, melting, and/or shock deformation features in the fragments should be
considered as priority signs of meteoritic origin.

  spatial and structural heterogeneity","34 pages",,,,"q-bio.CB math.DS q-bio.MN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sensing and reciprocating cellular systems (SARs) are important for the
operation of many biological systems. Production in interferon (IFN) SARs is
achieved through activation of the Jak-Stat pathway, and downstream
upregulation of IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-3 and IFN transcription, but the
role that high and low affinity IFNs play in this process remains unclear. We
present a comparative between a minimal spatio-temporal partial differential
equation (PDE) model and a novel spatio-structural-temporal (SST) model for the
consideration of receptor, binding, and metabolic aspects of SAR behaviour.
Using the SST framework, we simulate single- and multi-cluster paradigms of IFN
communication. Simulations reveal a cyclic process between the binding of IFN
to the receptor, and the consequent increase in metabolism, decreasing the
propensity for binding due to the internal feed-back mechanism. One observes
the effect of heterogeneity between cellular clusters, allowing them to
individualise and increase local production, and within clusters, where we
observe `sub popular quiescence'; a process whereby intra-cluster
subpopulations reduce their binding and metabolism such that other such
subpopulations may augment their production. Finally, we observe the ability
for low affinity IFN to communicate a long range signal, where high affinity
cannot, and the breakdown of this relationship through the introduction of cell
motility. Biological systems may utilise cell motility where environments are
unrestrictive and may use fixed system, with low affinity communication, where
a localised response is desirable.

approximations to algorithmic complexity by lossless compression and an

polyominoes, polytopes, regular and quasi-regular polyhedra as well as
polyhedral networks, thereby demonstrating its profiling capabilities.
