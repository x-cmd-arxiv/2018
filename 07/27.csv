  Embeddings of Social and Semantic Networks",,,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Research has repeatedly demonstrated the influence of social connection and
communication on convergence in cultural tastes, opinions and ideas. Here we
review recent studies and consider the implications of social connection on
cultural, epistemological and ideological contraction, then formalize these
intuitions within the language of information theory. To systematically examine
connectivity and cultural diversity, we introduce new methods of manifold
learning to map both social networks and topic combinations into comparable,
two-dimensional hyperbolic spaces or Poincar\'e disks, which represent both
hierarchy and diversity within a system. On a Poincar\'e disk, radius from
center traces the position of an actor in a social hierarchy or an idea in a
cultural hierarchy. The angle of the disk required to inscribe connected actors
or ideas captures their diversity. Using this method in the epistemic culture
of 21st Century physics, we empirically demonstrate that denser university
collaborations systematically contract the space of topics discussed and ideas
investigated more than shared topics drive collaboration, despite the extreme
commitments academic physicists make to research programs over the course of
their careers. Dense connections unleash flows of communication that contract
otherwise fragmented semantic spaces into convergent hubs or polarized
clusters. We theorize the dynamic interplay between structural expansion and
cultural contraction and explore how this introduces an essential tension
between the enjoyment and protection of difference.

outage probability associated with every transmit power. As a function of data
loss tolerance parameters, and minimum rate and peak power constraints, we
formulate an optimization problem that adapts rate and power to minimize the

optimization problem is formulated where transmission rate is assumed to be
fixed for each packet transmission. We use Markov chain to model constraints of

the direct-to-reverberant energy ratio (DRR) and also estimates and tracks the
$T_{60}$ and the DRR in every frequency bin in order to improve the estimation
of the speech log-magnitude spectrum. The Kalman filtering algorithm is tested

correspondence of the behavior of these tubes to the analytical model. A proof
of the principle of the novel method of power control in magnetrons, based on
the developed model, was demonstrated in the experiments. The method is
attractive for high-current superconducting rf accelerators. This paper also
discusses vector methods of power control with the rates required for
superconducting accelerators, the impact of the rf resonant signal injected
into the magnetron on the rate of phase control of the injection-locked tubes,
and a conceptual scheme of the magnetron transmitter with highest efficiency
for high-current accelerators.

dust opacity index (hence grain size and composition), based on the new PPMAP

opacity index reported by other recent studies, including the central decrease
within ~ 3 kpc of the nucleus. We also investigate the detailed distribution of
dust in the nuclear region, a prominent feature of which is a ~ 500 pc bar-like
structure seen previously in H{\alpha}. The nature of this feature has been the
subject of some debate. Our maps show it to be the site of the warmest dust,
with a mean line-of-sight temperature ~ 30 K. A comparison with the stellar
distribution, based on 2MASS data, provides strong evidence that it is a
gravitationally induced bar. A comparison with radial velocity maps suggests
the presence of an inflow towards the nucleus from opposite directions along
this bar, fed presumably by the nuclear spiral with which it appears to
connect. Such behaviour is common in large-scale bars in spiral galaxies, as is
the phenomenon of nested bars whereby a subkiloparsec nuclear bar exists within
a large-scale primary bar. We suggest that M31 represents an example of such
nesting.

Since then many authors have sought to apply this technique to control problems

  A crucial assumption is that the input process is essentially unconstrained.
For example, if the nominal dynamics include randomness from nature (e.g., the
impact of wind on a moving vehicle), then the optimal control solution does not
respect the exogenous nature of this disturbance.
  This paper introduces a technique to solve a more general class of

($\mathsf{CA}$), as introduced in Simpson '17, in terms of quantifier
alternations of formulae occurring. Writing $C\Sigma_n$ for (the logical
consequences of) cyclic proofs containing only $\Sigma_n$ formulae, our main
result is that $I\Sigma_{n+1}$ and $C\Sigma_n$ prove the same $\Pi_{n+1}$
theorems, for all $n\geq 0$. Furthermore, due to the 'uniformity' of our
method, we also show that $\mathsf{CA}$ and Peano Arithmetic ($\mathsf{PA}$)
proofs of the same theorem differ only exponentially in size.
  The inclusion $I\Sigma_{n+1} \subseteq C\Sigma_n$ is obtained by proof
theoretic techniques, relying on normal forms and structural manipulations of
$\mathsf{PA}$ proofs. It improves upon the natural result that $I\Sigma_n$ is
contained in $C\Sigma_n$. The converse inclusion, $C\Sigma_n \subseteq
I\Sigma_{n+1}$, is obtained by calibrating the approach of Simpson '17 with
recent results on the reverse mathematics of B\""uchi's theorem in
Ko{\l}odziejczyk, Michalewski, Pradic & Skrzypczak '16 (KMPS'16), and
specialising to the case of cyclic proofs. These results improve upon the
bounds on proof complexity and logical complexity implicit in Simpson '17 and
also an alternative approach due to Berardi & Tatsuta '17.
  The uniformity of our method also allows us to recover a metamathematical
account of fragments of $\mathsf{CA}$; in particular we show that, for $n\geq
0$, the consistency of $C\Sigma_n$ is provable in $I\Sigma_{n+2}$ but not
$I\Sigma_{n+1}$. As a result, we show that certain versions of McNaughton's

undetectable with current methods. Aims: We identify and analyse traces of
exomoons in the temporal variation of total and polarised fluxes of starlight
reflected by an Earth-like exoplanet and its spatially unresolved moon across
all phase angles, with both orbits viewed in an edge-on geometry. Methods: We
compute the total and linearly polarised fluxes, and the degree of linear
polarization P of starlight that is reflected by the exoplanet with its moon
along their orbits, accounting for the temporal variation of the visibility of
the planetary and lunar disks, and including effects of mutual transits and
mutual eclipses. Our computations pertain to a wavelength of 450 nm. Results:
Total flux F shows regular dips due to planetary and lunar transits and
eclipses. Polarization P shows regular peaks due to planetary transits and
lunar eclipses, and P can increase and/or slightly decrease during lunar
transits and planetary eclipses. Changes in F and P will depend on the radii of
the planet and moon, on their reflective properties, and their orbits, and are
about one magnitude smaller than the smooth background signals. The typical
duration of a transit or an eclipse is a few hours. Conclusions: Traces of an
exomoon due to planetary and lunar transits and eclipses show up in F and P of
sunlight reflected by planet-moon systems and could be searched for in

associated with the second branch of the dispersion relation depends on the
value of the sound speed. In the subluminal case, the second branch has a mass
gap. On the contrary, in the superluminal case, this branch is vulnerable to a
tachyonic instability. We also discuss the special case of the P(X)-theories
with an imaginary sound speed leading to the catastrophic gradient instability.
The complex field models provide with a cutoff on the momenta involved in the
instability.

leads to very high $N_{\textrm{eff}}$ which might be in conflict with bounds
from BBN. Our analysis indicates that fully thermalized sterile neutrinos with

the utility of quantum states as a computational resource. Our work is
motivated by the magic state model of fault-tolerant quantum computation. In
this model, all unitaries belong to the Clifford group. Non-Clifford operations
are effected by injecting non-stabiliser states, which are referred to as magic
states in this context. The robustness of magic measures the complexity of
simulating such a circuit using a classical Monte Carlo algorithm. It is
closely related to the degree negativity that slows down Monte Carlo
simulations through the infamous sign problem. Surprisingly, the robustness of
magic is submultiplicative. This implies that the classical simulation overhead
scales subexponentially with the number of injected magic states - better than
a naive analysis would suggest. However, determining the robustness of n copies
of a magic state is difficult, as its definition involves a convex optimisation
problem in a 4^n-dimensional space. In this paper, we make use of inherent
symmetries to reduce the problem to n dimensions. The total run-time of our
algorithm, while still exponential in n, is super-polynomially faster than
previously published methods. We provide a computer implementation and give the
robustness of up to 10 copies of the most commonly used magic states. Guided by
the exact results, we find a finite hierarchy of approximate solutions where
each level can be evaluated in polynomial time and yields rigorous upper bounds
to the robustness. Technically, we use symmetries of the stabiliser polytope to
connect the robustness of magic to the geometry of a low-dimensional convex
polytope generated by certain signed quantum weight enumerators. As a
by-product, we characterised the automorphism group of the stabiliser polytope,
and, more generally, of projections onto complex projective 3-designs.

making EPIC 246851721 the fourth hottest star to host a Jovian planet with $P >

primordial rather than a result of tidal damping. The host star also has a
bound stellar companion, a $0.4 \ M_\odot$ M dwarf at a projected separation of
2100 AU, but the companion is likely incapable of emplacing EPIC 246851721 b in
its current orbit via high eccentricity Kozai-Lidov migration.

introduce Variational Autoencoding Learning of Options by Reinforcement

contexts from a noise distribution into trajectories, and the decoder recovers
the contexts from the complete trajectories. Second: we propose a curriculum

training for VALOR and prior variational option discovery methods, allowing a

combining atomic property weighted radial distribution function (AP-RDF)

performance of the Bag-of-Bonds descriptor, when the bond type restriction is

the kernel which captures the multidimensional representation of the AP-RDF. On
the other hand, the numerical version of the AP-RDF is a constant size

also discussed a connection between molecular quantum similarity and machine

a robot's performance in problems like object recognition often depends on the
angle from which the object is observed. Traditionally, robot sorting tasks
rely on a fixed top-down view of an object. By changing its viewing angle, a
robot can select a more semantically informative view leading to better
performance for object recognition. In this paper, we introduce the problem of
semantic view selection, which seeks to find good camera poses to gain semantic
knowledge about an observed object. We propose a conceptual formulation of the
problem, together with a solvable relaxation based on clustering. We then
present a new image dataset consisting of around 10k images representing
various views of 144 objects under different poses. Finally we use this dataset
to propose a first solution to the problem by training a neural network to
predict a ""semantic score"" from a top view image and camera pose. The views
predicted to have higher scores are then shown to provide better clustering
results than fixed top-down views.

that is, the discrete-time model whose state matches that of the
continuous-time nonlinear system at the sampling instants may be difficult or
even impossible to obtain. In this context, one approach to the analysis of
stability is based on the use of an approximate discrete-time model and a bound
on the mismatch between the exact and approximate models. This approach
requires three conceptually different tasks: i) ensure the stability of the
(approximate) discrete-time model, ii) ensure that the stability of the
approximate model carries over to the exact model, iii) if necessary, bound
intersample behaviour. Existing conditions for ensuring the stability of a
discrete-time model as per task i) have some or all of the following drawbacks:
are only sufficient but not necessary; do not allow for varying sampling rate;
cannot be applied in the presence of state-measurement or actuation errors. In
this paper, we overcome these drawbacks by providing characterizations of, i.e.
necessary and sufficient conditions for, two stability properties: semiglobal
asymptotic stability, robustly with respect to bounded disturbances, and
semiglobal input-to-state stability, where the (disturbance) input may
successfully represent state-measurement or actuation errors. Our results can

waves in the tissue or in a phantom medium is modeled using the compressible
Navier-Stokes equations on a fixed grid, while the microbubbles dynamics and
motion are modeled as discrete singularities, which are tracked in a Lagrangian
framework. These two models are coupled to each other such that both the
acoustic field and the bubbles influence each other. The temperature rise in
the field is calculated by solving a heat transfer equation applied over a much
longer time scale. The compressible continuum part of the model is validated by
conducting HIFU simulation without microbubbles and comparing the pressure and
temperature fields against available experiments. The coupled
Eulerian-Lagrangian approach is then validated against existing experiments
with a phantom tissue. The various mechanisms through which microbubbles
enhance heat deposition are then examined in detail. The effects of the initial
void fraction in the cloud are then sought by considering the changes in the
attenuation of the primary ultrasonic wave and the modifications of the
enhanced heat deposition in the focal region. Finally, the effects of the
microbubble cloud size and its localization in the focal region are shown and
the effects of these parameters in altering the temperature rise and the

  a Hamming square","30 pages",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bootstrap percolation on a graph is a deterministic process that iteratively
enlarges a set of occupied sites by adjoining points with at least $\theta$
occupied neighbors. The initially occupied set is random, given by a uniform
product measure with a low density $p$. Our main focus is on this process on
the product graph $\mathbb{Z}^2\times K_n^2$, where $K_n$ is a complete graph.
We investigate how $p$ scales with $n$ so that a typical site is eventually
occupied. Under critical scaling, the dynamics with even $\theta$ exhibits a
sharp phase transition, while odd $\theta$ yields a gradual percolation
transition. We also establish a gradual transition for bootstrap percolation on
$\mathbb{Z}^2\times K_n$. The main tool is heterogeneous bootstrap percolation
on $\mathbb{Z}^2$.

  Bose-Einstein condensate- optomechanical cavity via coherent modulation","11 pages, 5 figures",,"10.1016/j.aop.2019.03.019",,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider an optomechanical cavity with a movable end-mirror as a quantum
mechanical oscillator (MO) containing an interacting cigar-shaped
Bose-Eisenstein condensate (BEC). It is assumed that both the MO and the BEC
interact with the radiation pressure of the cavity field in the red-detuned and
weak coupling regimes while the two-body atomic collisions frequency of the BEC
and the mechanical spring coefficient of the MO are coherently modulated. By
analyzing the scattering matrix we find that a frequency-dependent squeezing is
induced to the three subsystems only due to the coherent modulations. In the
largely different cooperativities regime together with strong modulations, the
mechanical mode of the MO and the Bogoliubov mode of the BEC exhibit quadrature
squeezing which can surpass the so-called 3dB limit (up to 75 dB) with high
robustness to the thermal noises. Surprisingly, in this regime by controlling
the system and modulation parameters, a very high degree of squeezing (up to 16
dB) together with high purity of quantum state for the output cavity field is
achievable. Furthermore, one can attain simultaneous strong quantum
amplification, added-noise suppression, and controllable gain-bandwidth for the
complementary quadratures of squeezed ones in the subsystems.

clustering algorithm for data in $\mathbb{R}^p$. SCAMP is motivated from the
point of view of non-parametric mixture modeling. Rather than maximizing a
classification likelihood to determine cluster assignments, SCAMP casts
clustering as a search and selection problem. One consequence of this problem
formulation is that the number of clusters is $\textbf{not}$ a SCAMP tuning
parameter. The search phase of SCAMP consists of finding sub-collections of the
data matrix, called candidate clusters, that obey shape constraints along each
coordinate projection. An extension of the dip test of Hartigan and Hartigan
(1985) is developed to assist the search. Selection occurs by scoring each
candidate cluster with a preference function that quantifies prior belief about
the mixture composition. Clustering proceeds by selecting candidates to
maximize their total preference score. SCAMP concludes by annotating each
selected cluster with labels that describe how cluster-level statistics compare
to certain dataset-level quantities. SCAMP can be run multiple times on a
single data matrix. Comparison of annotations obtained across iterations
provides a measure of clustering uncertainty. Simulation studies and
applications to real data are considered. A C++ implementation with R interface
is $\href{https://github.com/RGLab/scamp}{available\ online}$.

have been experimentally realized in classical, optical settings with balanced
gain and loss, or in quantum systems with localized loss. In both realizations,
the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking transition occurs at the exceptional point
of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, where its eigenvalues and the corresponding
eigenvectors both coincide. Here, we show that in lossy systems, the
$\mathcal{PT}$ transition is a phenomenon that broadly occurs without an
attendant exceptional point, and is driven by the potential asymmetry between
the neutral and the lossy regions. With experimentally realizable quantum
models in mind, we investigate dimer and trimer waveguide configurations with
one lossy waveguide. We validate the tight-binding model results by using the
beam propagation method analysis. Our results pave a robust way toward studying
the interplay between passive $\mathcal{PT}$ transitions and quantum effects in
dissipative photonic configurations.

systematic effects in galaxy redshift surveys. Our goal is to demonstrate the
viability of using Counts-in-Cells (CiC), a statistical measure of the galaxy
distribution, as a competitive method to determine linear and higher-order
galaxy bias and assess clustering systematics. We measure the galaxy bias by
comparing the first four moments of the galaxy density distribution with those
of the dark matter distribution. We use data from the MICE simulation to
evaluate the performance of this method, and subsequently perform measurements
on the public Science Verification (SV) data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES).
We find that the linear bias obtained with CiC is consistent with measurements
of the bias performed using galaxy-galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing,
CMB lensing, and shear+clustering measurements. Furthermore, we compute the
projected (2D) non-linear bias using the expansion $\delta_{g} = \sum_{k=0}^{3}
(b_{k}/k!) \delta^{k}$, finding a non-zero value for $b_2$ at the $3\sigma$
level. We also check a non-local bias model and show that the linear bias
measurements are robust to the addition of new parameters. We compare our 2D
results to the 3D prediction and find compatibility in the large scale regime

with theories ranging from classical Zeeman origins to predominantly non-Zeeman
anisotropic excitation or propagation effects. Features with an internal
electric vector position angle (EVPA) rotation of $\sim \pi /2$ offer unique
constraints on theoretical models. In this work, results are presented for one
such feature that persisted across five epochs of SiO $\nu=1, J=1-0$ VLBA

linear polarization and EVPA on angle ($\theta$) between the line of sight and
the magnetic field against theoretical models. We also present results on the
dependence of $m_c$ on $\theta$ and their theoretical implications. Finally, we
discuss potential causes of the observed differences, and continuing work.

of information. Speckle noise gives SAR images a granular appearance that makes
interpretation and analysis hard tasks. A major issue is the assessment of
information content in these kind of images, and how it is affected by usual
processing techniques. Previous works have resulted in various approaches for
quantifying image information content. As Narayanan, Desetty, and
Reichenbach(2002) we study this problem from the classification accuracy
viewpoint, focusing in the filtering and the classification stages. Thus,
through classified images we verify how changing properties of the input data
affects their quality. Our input is an actual PolSAR image, the control
parameters are the filter (Local Mean or Model Based PolSAR, MBPolSAR), the
size of them and the classification method (Maximum Likelihood, ML, or Support
Vector Machine, SVM), and the output are the classification precision obtained
applying the classification algorithm to the filtered data. To expand the
conclusions, this study deals not only with Classification Accuracy, but also
with Kappa and Overall Accuracy as measures of map precision. Experiments were
conducted on two airborne PolSAR images. Unless Narayanan, Desetty, and
Reichenbach(2002) almost all measure values are good and increase with
degradation, i.e. the filtering algorithm that we used always improves the
classification results at least up to 7x7.

the DUNE Far Detector modules in preparation for the full TDR to be published
in 2019. It is intended as an intermediate milestone on the path to a full TDR,
justifying the technical choices that flow down from the high-level physics
goals through requirements at all levels of the Project. These design choices
will enable the DUNE experiment to make the ground-breaking discoveries that
will help to answer fundamental physics questions. Volume 1 contains an
executive summary that describes the general aims of this document. The
remainder of this first volume provides a more detailed description of the DUNE
physics program that drives the choice of detector technologies. It also
includes concise outlines of two overarching systems that have not yet evolved
to consortium structures: computing and calibration. Volumes 2 and 3 of this
IDR describe, for the single-phase and dual-phase technologies, respectively,
each detector module's subsystems, the technical coordination required for its
design, construction, installation, and integration, and its organizational
structure.

making imperceptible adversarial perturbations to an image. Recent studies have
shown that these perturbations can be detected even without information about
the neural network if the strategy taken by the adversary is known beforehand.
Unfortunately, these studies suffer from the generalization limitation -- the
detection method has to be recalibrated every time the adversary changes his
strategy. In this study, we attempt to overcome the generalization limitation
by deriving a metric which reliably identifies adversarial images even when the
approach taken by the adversary is unknown. Our metric leverages key
differences between the spectra of clean and adversarial images when an image
is treated as a matrix. Our metric is able to detect adversarial images across
different datasets and attack strategies without any additional re-calibration.
In addition, our approach provides geometric insights into several unanswered
questions about adversarial perturbations.

scene understanding. The task is challenging due to disjoint views and
illumination variation in different cameras. In this direction, many
graph-based methods were proposed using appearance-based features. However, the
appearance information fades with high illumination variation in the different
camera FOVs. We, in this paper, use spatial and temporal information as the
state of the target to learn a policy that predicts the next camera given the
current state. The policy is trained using Q-learning and it does not assume
any information about the topology of the camera network. We will show that the
policy learns the camera network topology. We demonstrate the performance of
the proposed method on the NLPR MCT dataset.

unexpected decrease in the value of the $\rho$ parameter and a $\sigma_{tot}$
value in agreement with the trend of previous measurements at 7 and 8 TeV.
These data at 13 TeV are not simultaneously described by the predictions from
Pomeron models selected by the COMPETE Collaboration, but show agreement with
the maximal Odderon dominance, as recently demonstrated by Martynov and
Nicolescu. Here we present a detailed analysis on the applicability of Pomeron
dominance by means of a general class of forward scattering amplitude,
consisting of even-under-crossing leading contributions associated with single,
double and triple poles in the complex angular momentum plane. We carry out
fits to $pp$ and $\bar{p}p$ data in the interval 5 GeV - 13 TeV. The data set
comprises all the accelerator data below 7 TeV and we consider two independent
ensembles by adding either only the TOTEM data or TOTEM and ATLAS data at the
LHC energy region. In the data reductions to each ensemble the uncertainty
regions are evaluated with both one and two standard deviation ($\sim$ 68 \%
and $\sim$ 95 \% CL, respectively). Besides the general analytic model, we
investigate four particular cases of interest, three of them typical of
outstanding models in the literature. We conclude that, within the experimental
and theoretical uncertainties and both ensembles, the general model and three
particular cases are not able to describe the $\sigma_{tot}$ and $\rho$ data at
13 TeV simultaneously. However, if the discrepancies between the TOTEM and
ATLAS data are not resolved, one Pomeron model, associated with double and
triple poles and with only 7 free parameters, seems not to be excluded by the
complete set of experimental information presently available.

we find values for the critical exponent and echoing period of the discretely

moreover we find that such small deformations behave like damped oscillations
whose damping coefficient and oscillation frequencies are consistent with those
predicted in the linear perturbation calculations of Martin-Garcia and
Gundlach. However, we also find that the critical exponent and echoing period
appear to decrease with increasing departure from sphericity, and that, for
sufficiently large departures from spherical symmetry, the deviations become
unstable and grow, confirming earlier results by Choptuik et.al.. We find some
evidence that these growing modes lead to a bifurcation, similar to those
reported by Choptuik et.al., with two centers of collapse forming on the
symmetry axis above and below the origin. These findings suggest that nonlinear
perturbations of the critical solution lead to changes in the effective values
of the critical exponent, echoing period and damping coefficient, and may even
change the sign of the latter, so that perturbations that are stable in the

applications, including magnets, electric machines, and fault current limiters,
because they can enable a compact, lightweight and high efficiency design. In
applications such those mentioned above, superconducting coils are always a key
component. For example, in a superconducting electric machine, the
superconducting coils are used to generate the main flux density in the air
gap, which is significantly important for the energy conversion. It is the
performance of the superconducting coils that plays an essential role in
determining the performance of the device. However, the performance of a
superconducting coil is limited by its critical current, which is determined by
temperature and the magnitude and orientation of the magnetic field inside the
superconductors. Hence, in-depth investigations to estimate the critical
current of the superconducting coils are necessary before manufacturing.
Available transient simulation models to estimate the critical current are
through the H- and T-A formulations of Maxwell's equations. Both methods
consider the same current ramp-up process occurring in experiments. Besides
these transient models, static simulations can also be used: a modified
load-line method and the so-called P-model, which is based on the asymptotic
limit of Faraday's equation when time approaches infinity. To find the best way
to calculate the critical current, the four methods are used to estimate the
critical current of a double pancake superconducting coils and results are
compared with experiments. As a conclusion, T-A formulation, P-model, and the
modified load-line methods are recommended for estimating the critical current
of the superconducting coils.

the star $u = GM/c^2 R$, the maximum value $u = 0.2660858316$ which allow to
describe compact stars like quark stars or neutron stars. Although there is a
diversity of stars for which the model can be used, we only apply this solution
to describe the interior of a neutron star PSR J0348$+$0432. According to the
observations, it is known that its mass $M = (2.01 \pm 0.04)M_{\odot}$ and its
radius is between 12.062Km and 12.957Km, so the value of the compactness is in
the range $u \in [0.2244845, 0.2509338]$. In addition to the decreasing
behavior of the mentioned pressure and density functions, the results are
consistent with the density values range typical of neutron stars and the
maximal central density of the star result to be 1.283818 $\times 10^{18}

extrapolated properties for long polymer chains. We show that message-passing

obtained without using optimized 3D geometry as an input. We further show that

methodology towards computing motion plans for complex robotic systems by
learning a plannable latent representation. Recent works in control of robotic
systems have effectively leveraged local, low-dimensional embeddings of
high-dimensional dynamics. In this paper we combine these recent advances with
techniques from sampling-based motion planning (SBMP) in order to design a
methodology capable of planning for high-dimensional robotic systems beyond the
reach of traditional approaches (e.g., humanoids, or even systems where
planning occurs in the visual space). Specifically, the learned latent space is
constructed through an autoencoding network, a dynamics network, and a
collision checking network, which mirror the three main algorithmic primitives
of SBMP, namely state sampling, local steering, and collision checking.
Notably, these networks can be trained through only raw data of the system's
states and actions along with a supervising collision checker. Building upon
these networks, an RRT-based algorithm is used to plan motions directly in the
latent space - we refer to this exploration algorithm as Learned Latent RRT
(L2RRT). This algorithm globally explores the latent space and is capable of
generalizing to new environments. The overall methodology is demonstrated on
two planning problems, namely a visual planning problem, whereby planning
happens in the visual (pixel) space, and a humanoid robot planning problem.

the familiar multivariate regression framework and propose an integrative
reduced-rank regression (iRRR), where each view has its own low-rank

supervised fashion. For model estimation, we develop a convex composite nuclear

several special cases of iRRR including Lasso, group Lasso and nuclear norm
penalized regression. Therefore, iRRR seamlessly bridges group-sparse and

analyze the oscillatory solutions for the universe in a modified theory of
gravity THED (Torsion Hides Extra-Dimension) and evaluate them by fitting Type
1a supernovae redshift data. THED-gravity exactly mimics General Relativity at
the kinematical level, while the modifications in its dynamical equations allow
the universe to bounce between a minimum size and a maximum size with a zero
average energy within each oscillation. The optimally fit oscillatory solutions
correspond to a universe with (i) a small matter density requiring little to no
dark matter, (ii) a significantly negative spatial curvature, (iii) a tiny
negative dark energy. Alternatively, there exists non-oscillating solutions
that appear as an ever-expanding universe from a single bounce preceded by a
collapse from the infinite past. These ever-expanding solutions provide
marginally better fits to the supernova redshift data, but require larger
matter densities and positive dark energy along with a positive spatial
curvature. A qualitative analysis of CMB power spectrum in the modified theory
suggests a significant negative spatial curvature, which is in stark contrast
to a near-zero curvature in the standard big bang theory. An independent
constraint on the spatial curvature can further shed light on discriminating
the ever expanding and oscillatory universe scenarios.

higher dimension, i.e., qutrits (D = 3) and especially qudits (D = 4 or
higher), offer significant advantages. Particularly, they can provide
noise-resistant quantum cryptography, simplify quantum logic and improve
quantum metrology. Flying and solid-state qudits have been implemented on the
basis of photonic chips and superconducting circuits, respectively. However,
there is still a lack of room-temperature qudits with long coherence time and
high spectral resolution. The silicon vacancy centers in silicon carbide (SiC)
with spin S = 3/2 are quite promising in this respect, but until now they were
treated as a canonical qubit system. Here, we apply a two-frequency protocol to
excite and image multiple qudit modes in a SiC spin ensemble under ambient
conditions. Strikingly, their spectral width is about one order of magnitude
narrower than the inhomogeneous broadening of the corresponding spin resonance.
By applying Ramsey interferometry to these spin qudits, we achieve a spectral
selectivity of 600 kHz and a spectral resolution of 30 kHz. As a practical
consequence, we demonstrate absolute DC magnetometry insensitive to thermal
noise and strain fluctuations.

the observed colors to be much redder than the model predictions, and that
these offsets are unlikely to be caused by dust reddening. We confirm previous

the colors for dust reddening by assuming a constant b-v color we find no
correlation between the uvw1-v or u-v colors and the ejecta velocities for 25
SNe Ia with published velocities and/or spectra. When assuming an optical
color-velocity relation, a correlation of 2 and 3.6 sigma is found for uvw1-v

correction and can be reproduced with random colors which are corrected for
reddening. The significance of a correlation between the UV colors and the
velocity is thus dependent on the assumed slope of the optical color-velocity
relation. After such a correction, the uvw1-v versus velocity slope is
shallower than that predicted by the models and offset to redder colors. A
significant scatter still remains in the uvw1-v colors including a large spread
at low velocities. This demonstrates that the NUV-blue/red spread is not caused
solely by the photospheric velocity. The uvm2-uvw1 colors also show a large
dispersion which is uncorrelated with the velocity.

regions of spectrum OFCs can be generated intrinsically by the free-running
quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) with high efficiency. These combs do not look
like conventional OFCs as the phases of each mode are different and in temporal
domain the OFC is a seemingly random combination of amplitude- and
phase-modulated signals rather than a short pulse. Despite this
pseudo-randomness, the experimental evidence suggests that the linewidth of the
QCL OFC is just as narrow as that of a QCL operating in the single mode. While
universally acknowledged, this seemingly observation is not fully understood.

isotropic and homogeneous elastic body (virtual problem) to that of an
anisotropic and inhomogeneous elastic body with a hole surrounded by a cloak
that is to be designed (physical problem). The virtual body has a desired
mechanical response while the physical body is designed to mimic the same
response outside the cloak using a cloaking transformation. We show that
nonlinear elastodynamics transformation cloaking is not possible while
nonlinear elastostatics cloaking may be possible for special deformations,
e.g., radial deformations in a body with either a cylindrical or a spherical
cavity. For linear elastodynamics, in line with the previous observations in
the literature, we show that the elastic constants in the cloak are not fully
symmetric; they do not possess the minor symmetries. We prove that
transformation cloaking is not possible regardless of the shape of the hole and
the cloak. We next show that linear elastodynamics transformation cloaking
cannot be achieved for gradient elastic solids either; similar to classical
linear elasticity the balance of angular momentum is the obstruction to
transformation cloaking. We finally prove that transformation cloaking is not
possible for linear elastic generalized Cosserat solids in 2D for any shape of
the hole and the cloak. Particularly, in 2D, transformation cloaking cannot be
achieved in linear Cosserat elasticity. We also show that transformation
cloaking for a spherical cavity covered by a spherical cloak is not possible in
the setting of linear elastic generalized Cosserat solids. We conjecture that
this result holds for a cavity of any shape.

a curved, Schwarzschild metric background to calculate the coupling between the
gravitational field and the optical signal. The analysis is extended to include
the injection of a squeezed vacuum to the Mach-Zehnder arrangement and also to
consider an active, two-mode SU(1,1) interferometer in a similar arrangement.
When detection loss is larger than $8\%$, the SU(1,1) interferometer shows an
advantage over the MZ interferometer with single-mode squeezing input. The
proposed system is based on current technology and could be used to examine the
intersection of quantum theory and general relativity as well as for possible
applications.

The entropy is extracted from the Gibbs-Duhem relation and shows complex

variations in the supercritical region. The free energy allows us to identify
the thermodynamic phase boundary, to discuss phases stability and
metastability, and to touch upon nucleation and spinodal decomposition
mechanisms for the transition. We complement this thermodynamic description of
the Mott transition by an information-theoretic description. We achieve this by
calculating the local entropy, which is a measure of entanglement, and the
single-site total mutual information, which quantifies quantum and classical
correlations. These information-theoretic measures exhibit characteristic

find that they are dominated by spin-orbit interactions originating from the
vector potential, consistent with recent theoretical predictions. Conversely,
by populating the double dot with two electrons we probe the mixing of singlet

is dominated by momentum-term spin-orbit interactions that varies from 1.85 MHz
up to 27.5 MHz depending on the magnetic field orientation. Finally, we exploit
the tunability of the derivative of the Stark shift of one of the dots to
reduce its sensitivity to electric noise and observe an 80 % increase in

crucial for scalable quantum computing in silicon and that the optimal setting

due to an A_V < 1 mag condition imposed while initializing the Markov chains in

non-linear phenomena such as high-harmonic generations 1, 2 and attosecond
charge dynamics 3, 4. They are distinct from conventional photonics. However,
main targets have been limited to insulators and semiconductors, although
theoretical approaches have been made also for correlated metals and
superconductors 5. Here, in a layered organic superconductor, a non-linear
charge oscillation driven by a nearly single-cycle strong electric field of >10
megavolts /cm is observed as a stimulated emission. The charge oscillation is
different from a linear response and ascribed to a polar charge oscillation
with a period of 6 fs. This non-linear polar charge oscillation is enhanced by
critical fluctuations near a superconducting transition temperature and a
critical end point of first order Mott transitions. Its observation on an
ultrafast timescale of 10 fs clarifies that the Coulomb repulsion plays an
essential role in superconductivity of organic superconductors.

observations of M33 taken in 2017 March and July, with M33 X-8 in the field of
view. The source demonstrates a nearly constant flux during the observations,
and its 3-20 keV spectrum can be well described by two distinct components: a
standard accretion disc with a temperature of ~1 keV at the inner radius and a
power law with a photon index ~3, which is significantly detected up to 20 keV.
There is also an indication of a high-energy cutoff in the spectrum,
corresponding to a temperature of the Comptonizing medium of >10 keV. The
broad-band spectral properties of M33 X-8 resemble black hole X-ray binaries in
their very high states, suggesting that M33 X-8 is a black hole accreting at a
nearly Eddington rate, in contrast to super-Eddington accretion believed to
take place in more luminous ULXs.

growth of monolayer MoS2 on not only planar but also micro- and nano-rugged
SiO2/Si substrates via metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. The continuity
of monolayer MoS2 on the rugged surface is evidenced by scanning electron
microscopy, cross-section high-resolution transmission electron microscopy,
photoluminescence (PL) mapping, and Raman mapping. Interestingly, the
photo-responsivity (~254.5 mA/W) of as-grown MoS2 on the nano-rugged substrate
exhibits 59 times higher than that of the planar sample (4.3 mA/W) under a
small applied bias of 0.1 V. This value is record high when compared with all
previous MoS2-based photocurrent generation under low or zero bias. Such a
large enhancement in the photo-responsivity arises from a large active area for
light-matter interaction and local strain for PL quenching, where the latter
effect is the key factor and unique in the conformally grown monolayer on the
nano-rugged surface. The result is a step toward the batch fabrication of

abilities and interests. An important problem in crowdsourcing is the task
recommendation problem, in which tasks that best match a particular worker's
preferences and reliabilities are recommended to that worker. A task
recommendation scheme that assigns tasks more likely to be accepted by a worker
who is more likely to complete it reliably results in better performance for
the task requester. Without prior information about a worker, his preferences
and reliabilities need to be learned over time. In this paper, we propose a
multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework to learn a worker's preferences and his
reliabilities for different categories of tasks. However, unlike the classical
MAB problem, the reward from the worker's completion of a task is unobservable.
We therefore include the use of gold tasks (i.e., tasks whose solutions are
known \emph{a priori} and which do not produce any rewards) in our task
recommendation procedure. Our model could be viewed as a new variant of MAB, in
which the random rewards can only be observed at those time steps where gold
tasks are used, and the accuracy of estimating the expected reward of
recommending a task to a worker depends on the number of gold tasks used. We
show that the optimal regret is $O(\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ is the number of tasks
recommended to the worker. We develop three task recommendation strategies to
determine the number of gold tasks for different task categories, and show that
they are order optimal. Simulations verify the efficiency of our approaches.

often analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). However, for effects with
more than one numerator degrees of freedom, e.g., for experimental factors with
more than two levels, the ANOVA omnibus F-test is not informative about the
source of a main effect or interaction. Because researchers typically have
specific hypotheses about which condition means differ from each other, a
priori contrasts (i.e., comparisons planned before the sample means are known)
between specific conditions or combinations of conditions are the appropriate
way to represent such hypotheses in the statistical model. Many researchers
have pointed out that contrasts should be ""tested instead of, rather than as a
supplement to, the ordinary `omnibus' F test"" (Hays, 1973, p. 601). In this
tutorial, we explain the mathematics underlying different kinds of contrasts
(i.e., treatment, sum, repeated, polynomial, custom, nested, interaction
contrasts), discuss their properties, and demonstrate how they are applied in
the R System for Statistical Computing (R Core Team, 2018). In this context, we
explain the generalized inverse which is needed to compute the coefficients for
contrasts that test hypotheses that are not covered by the default set of
contrasts. A detailed understanding of contrast coding is crucial for
successful and correct specification in linear models (including linear mixed
models). Contrasts defined a priori yield far more useful confirmatory tests of
experimental hypotheses than standard omnibus F-test. Reproducible code is

system using information that is neither classified nor labeled, with a view to
modeling the underlying structure or distribution in a dataset. Since
unsupervised machine learning systems are widely used in many real-world
applications, assessing the appropriateness of these systems and validating
their implementations with respect to individual users' requirements and
specific application scenarios$\,/\,$contexts are indisputably two important
tasks. Such assessment and validation tasks, however, are fairly challenging
due to the absence of a priori knowledge of the data. In view of this
challenge, we develop a $\textbf{MET}$amorphic $\textbf{T}$esting approach to
assessing and validating unsupervised machine $\textbf{LE}$arning systems,
abbreviated as METTLE. Our approach provides a new way to unveil the (possibly
latent) characteristics of various machine learning systems, by explicitly
considering the specific expectations and requirements of these systems from
individual users' perspectives. To support METTLE, we have further formulated
11 generic metamorphic relations (MRs), covering users' generally expected
characteristics that should be possessed by machine learning systems. To
demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of METTLE we have performed an
experiment involving six commonly used clustering systems. Our experiment has
shown that, guided by user-defined MR-based adequacy criteria, end users are
able to assess, validate, and select appropriate clustering systems in
accordance with their own specific needs. Our investigation has also yielded
insightful understanding and interpretation of the behavior of the machine
learning systems from an end-user software engineering's perspective, rather

technique used to improve the robustness of discriminator by combining
adversarial attacker and discriminator in the training phase. GAN is commonly
used for image generation by jointly optimizing discriminator and generator. We
show these two concepts are indeed closely related and can be used to
strengthen each other---adding a generator to the adversarial training
procedure can improve the robustness of discriminators, and adding an
adversarial attack to GAN training can improve the convergence speed and lead
to better generators. Combining these two insights, we develop a framework
called Rob-GAN to jointly optimize generator and discriminator in the presence
of adversarial attacks---the generator generates fake images to fool
discriminator; the adversarial attacker perturbs real images to fool the
discriminator, and the discriminator wants to minimize loss under fake and
adversarial images. Through this end-to-end training procedure, we are able to
simultaneously improve the convergence speed of GAN training, the quality of
synthetic images, and the robustness of discriminator under strong adversarial
attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that the obtained classifier is more
robust than the state-of-the-art adversarial training approach, and the
generator outperforms SN-GAN on ImageNet-143.

the optimization to computing the Nash equilibrium of a particular zero-sum
convex-concave game. Zero-sum games can be solved using online learning
dynamics, where a classical technique involves simulating two no-regret
algorithms that play against each other and, after $T$ rounds, the average
iterate is guaranteed to solve the original optimization problem with error
decaying as $O(\log T/T)$. In this paper we show that the technique can be
enhanced to a rate of $O(1/T^2)$ by extending recent work \cite{RS13,SALS15}
that leverages \textit{optimistic learning} to speed up equilibrium
computation. The resulting optimization algorithm derived from this analysis
coincides \textit{exactly} with the well-known \NA \cite{N83a} method, and
indeed the same story allows us to recover several variants of the Nesterov's
algorithm via small tweaks. We are also able to establish the accelerated
linear rate for a function which is both strongly-convex and smooth. This
methodology unifies a number of different iterative optimization methods: we
show that the \HB algorithm is precisely the non-optimistic variant of \NA, and
recent prior work already established a similar perspective on \FW

promising to gain tremendous energy-efficiency for many error resilient

provides the approximate results, while the predictor predicts whether the
input data is safe to approximate with the given quality requirement. However,
it is non-trivial and time-consuming to make these two neural network
coordinate---they have different optimization objectives---by training them
separately. This paper proposes a novel neural network structure---AXNet---to
fuse two NNs to a holistic end-to-end trainable NN. Leveraging the philosophy
of multi-task learning, AXNet can tremendously improve the invocation
(proportion of safe-to-approximate samples) and reduce the approximation error.
The training effort also decrease significantly. Experiment results show 50.7%
more invocation and substantial cuts of training time when compared to existing

have been measured on participants, a joint analysis strategy, whereby the
traits are analyzed jointly, can improve statistical power over a single-trait
analysis strategy. There are two questions of interest to be addressed when
conducting a joint GWAS analysis with multiple traits. The first question
examines whether a genetic loci is significantly associated with any of the
traits being tested. The second question focuses on identifying the specific
trait(s) that is associated with the genetic loci. Since existing methods
primarily focus on the first question, this paper seeks to provide a
complementary method that addresses the second question. We propose a novel
method, Variational Inference for Multiple Correlated Outcomes (VIMCO), that
focuses on identifying the specific trait that is associated with the genetic
loci, when performing a joint GWAS analysis of multiple traits, while
accounting for correlation among the multiple traits. We performed extensive
numerical studies and also applied VIMCO to analyze two datasets. The numerical
studies and real data analysis demonstrate that VIMCO improves statistical
power over single-trait analysis strategies when the multiple traits are
correlated and has comparable performance when the traits are not correlated.

spin 1/2 Fermi gas at low nonzero temperature T, undergoes with time a phase
change with a random component, due to coupling to the gas thermal phonons.
With the quantum second Josephson relation relating the derivative of the
condensate phase operator to the phonon occupation numbers, and linearised
kinetic equations giving the evolution of occupation number fluctuations, we
access the behaviour of the phase change variance at times much longer than the
phonon collision time. The case of a convex phonon branch is similar to the
Bose gas case: the leading collisional processes are the Beliaev-Landau
3-phonons processes, and the variance is the sum of a ballistic term and of a
delayed diffusive term, whose analytical expressions are given in the
thermodynamic limit. The concave case is more exotic. It is analysed at time
scales $T^{-9}$, allowing one to restrict to 2 phonons $\rightarrow$ 2 phonons
small-angle Landau-Khalatnikov processes. The total number of phonons is
conserved and the phonon mean occupation numbers at equilibrium can exhibit a
negative chemical potential, assumed isotropic. The phase change variance is
then the sum of a ballistic term, of a diffusive term, of exotic subsubleading
terms and of a constant term. The analytic expression of some of the
corresponding coefficients is obtained, as well as the diverging leading
behavior of the other ones when the phonon chemical potential tends to 0. When
this chemical potential is 0, the variance sub-ballistic part becomes
superdiffusive, with an exponent 5/3 and an exactly-known coefficient. For a
nonzero infinitesimal phonon chemical potential, a law is found, interpolating
between superdiffusive and diffusive phase spreading. Also new results are
obtained on the phonon Landau-Khalatnikov damping rate, in particular at
negative phonon chemical potential.

research and for the development of technologies with significant impact on
society. It provides methods that facilitate the discovery of regularities in
data and that give predictions without explicit knowledge of the rules
governing a system. However, a price is paid for exploiting such flexibility:
machine learning methods are typically black-boxes where it is difficult to
fully understand what the machine is doing or how it is operating. This poses
constraints on the applicability and explainability of such methods. Methods:
Our research aims to open the black-box of recurrent neural networks, an
important family of neural networks used for processing sequential data. We
propose a novel methodology that provides a mechanistic interpretation of
behaviour when solving a computational task. Our methodology uses mathematical
constructs called excitable network attractors, which are invariant sets in
phase space composed of stable attractors and excitable connections between
them. Results and Discussion: As the behaviour of recurrent neural networks
depends both on training and on inputs to the system, we introduce an algorithm
to extract network attractors directly from the trajectory of a neural network
while solving tasks. Simulations conducted on a controlled benchmark task
confirm the relevance of these attractors for interpreting the behaviour of
recurrent neural networks, at least for tasks that involve learning a finite
number of stable states and transitions between them.

demand in 5G networks that results from the emerging services like machine to
machine and vehicle to infrastructure communication. The idea is to allow a set
of entities access the spectrum whenever and wherever it is unused by the
licensed users. In the proposed framework, different spectrum provider (SP)
networks with surplus spectrum available may rank the operators requiring the
spectrum, called spectrum users (SUs) hereafter, differently in terms of their
preference to lease spectrum, based for example on target business market
considerations of the SUs. Similarly, SUs rank SPs depending on a number of
criteria, for example based on coverage and availability in a service area.
Ideally, both SPs and SUs prefer to provide/get spectrum to/from the operator
of their first choice, but this is not necessarily always possible due to
conflicting preferences. We apply matching theory algorithms with the aim to
resolve the conflicting preferences of the SPs and SUs and quantify the effect
of the proposed matching theory approach on establishing preferred (spectrum)
provider-user network pairs. We discuss both one-to-one and many-to-one
spectrum sharing scenarios and evaluate the performance using Monte Carlo
simulations. The results show that comprehensive gains in terms of preferred
matching of the provider-user network pairs can be achieved by applying
matching theory for spectrum sharing as compared to uncoordinated spectrum

In this work, we introduce a deep open-world group-based person re-id model
based on adversarial learning to alleviate the attack problem caused by similar
non-target people. The main idea is learning to attack feature extractor on the
target people by using GAN to generate very target-like images (imposters), and
in the meantime the model will make the feature extractor learn to tolerate the
attack by discriminative learning so as to realize group-based verification.
The framework we proposed is called the adversarial open-world person
re-identification, and this is realized by our Adversarial PersonNet (APN) that
jointly learns a generator, a person discriminator, a target discriminator and
a feature extractor, where the feature extractor and target discriminator share
the same weights so as to makes the feature extractor learn to tolerate the
attack by imposters for better group-based verification. While open-world
person re-id is challenging, we show for the first time that the
adversarial-based approach helps stabilize person re-id system under imposter
attack more effectively.

Very Large Telescope and the NIRI instrument on the Gemini observatory, coupled
with M-band imaging from Juno's JIRAM instrument during the first seven Juno
orbits. The wave is compact, with a $1.1-1.4^\circ$ longitude wavelength
(wavelength 1,300-1,600 km, wavenumber 260-330) that is stable over time, with
wave crests aligned largely north-south between $14$ and $17^\circ$N
(planetographic). The waves were initially identified in small ($10^\circ$
longitude) packets immediately west of cyclones in the NEB at $16^\circ$N, but
extended to span wider longitude ranges over time. The waves exhibit a 7-10 K
brightness temperature amplitude on top of a $\sim210$-K background at 5
$\mu$m. The thermal structure of the NEB allows for both inertio-gravity waves
and gravity waves. Despite detection at 5 $\mu$m, this does not necessarily
imply a deep location for the waves, and an upper tropospheric aerosol layer
near 400-800 mbar could feature a gravity wave pattern modulating the
visible-light reflectivity and attenuating the 5-$\mu$m radiance originating
from deeper levels. Strong rifting activity appears to obliterate the pattern,
which can change on timescales of weeks. The NEB underwent a new expansion and
contraction episode in 2016-17 with associated cyclone-anticyclone formation,
which could explain why the mesoscale wave pattern was more vivid in 2017 than
ever before.

with prescribed lower and upper bounds at specified high probability; the
estimator does not require the calculation of stability (coercivity, or
inf-sup) constants; the online cost to evaluate the a posteriori error
estimator is commensurate with the cost to find the reduced order
approximation; the probabilistic bounds extend to many queries with only modest
increase in cost. To build this estimator, we first estimate the norm of the
error with a Monte-Carlo estimator using Gaussian random vectors whose
covariance is chosen according to the desired error measure, e.g. user-defined
norms or quantity of interest. Then, we introduce a dual problem with random
right-hand side the solution of which allows us to rewrite the error estimator
in terms of the residual of the original equation. In order to have a
fast-to-evaluate estimator, model order reduction methods can be used to
approximate the random dual solutions. Here, we propose a greedy algorithm that
is guided by a scalar quantity of interest depending on the error estimator.
Numerical experiments on a multi-parametric Helmholtz problem demonstrate that
this strategy yields rather low-dimensional reduced dual spaces.

directly by the Soundness Theorem of program extraction. In order to get the

disciplines such as computer science, bioinformatics and economics. In this
problem, unknown links between nodes are discovered based on numerous
information such as network topology, profile information and user generated
contents. Most of the previous researchers have focused on the structural
features of the networks. While the recent researches indicate that contextual
information can change the network topology. Although, there are number of
valuable researches which combine structural and content information, but they
face with the scalability issue due to feature engineering. Because, majority
of the extracted features are obtained by a supervised or semi supervised
algorithm. Moreover, the existing features are not general enough to indicate
good performance on different networks with heterogeneous structures. Besides,
most of the previous researches are presented for undirected and unweighted
networks. In this paper, a novel link prediction framework called ""DeepLink"" is
presented based on deep learning techniques. In contrast to the previous
researches which fail to automatically extract best features for the link
prediction, deep learning reduces the manual feature engineering. In this
framework, both the structural and content information of the nodes are
employed. The framework can use different structural feature vectors, which are
prepared by various link prediction methods. It considers all proximity orders
that are presented in a network during the structural feature learning. We have
evaluated the performance of DeepLink on two real social network datasets

  Droplet Simulations with Large Density ratio",,,,,"physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) is one of the popular one-fluid mixed
Eulerian-Lagrangian methods to simulate motion of droplets. While the treatment
of a moving complex boundary is an extremely time consuming and formidable task
in a traditional boundary-fitted fluid solver, the one-fluid methods provide a
relatively easier way to track moving interfaces on a fixed Cartesian grid
since the regeneration of a mesh system that conforms to the interface at every
time step can be avoided. In the IBM, a series of connected Lagrangian markers
are used to represent a fluid-fluid interface and the boundary condition is
enforced by adding a forcing term to the Navier-Stokes equations. It is known
that the IBM suffers two problems. One is spontaneous generation of unphysical
kinetic energy, which is known as parasitic currents, and the other is spurious
reconstruction of interface. These two problems need to be solved for useful
long-time-scale simulations of droplets with high density ratio and large
surface tension. This work detects that the discrete delta function is the
cause of unphysical parasitic currents. Specifically, the irrotational
condition is not preserved when the common discrete delta function is used to
spread the surface tension from Lagrangian markers to Cartesian grid cells. To
solve this problem, a new scheme that preserves the irrotational condition is
proposed to remove the spurious currents. Furthermore, for a smooth
reconstruction of an interface, a B-spline fitting by least squares is adopted
to relocate the Lagrangian markers. The conventional and new interpolation
schemes are implemented in a multigrid finite volume Direct Numerical
Simulation (DNS) solver and are subjected to standard test cases. It is
confirmed that the unphysical parasitic currents are substantially reduced in
the new scheme and droplet's surface fluctuation is eliminated.

$\sim$300 TeV neutrino potentially correlated with the flaring $\gamma$-ray
source TXS 0506+056, directs attention toward BL Lac objects (BL Lacs), the
subclass of blazars with weak emission lines. While high-energy neutrinos can
be produced via photohadronic interactions between protons accelerated in their
jets and ambient low-energy photons, the density of the latter in such objects
had generally been thought to be too low for efficient neutrino emission. Here
we consider the role of radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs), which
can plausibly exist in the nuclei of BL Lacs, as the source of target photons
for neutrino production. Based on simple model prescriptions for the spectra of
RIAFs at different accretion rates, we find that they can be sufficienly
intense to allow appreciable neutrino emission for the class of
low-synchrotron-peak BL Lacs such as TXS 0506+056. In constrast, for
high-synchrotron-peak BL Lacs including Mkn 421 and Mkn 501, the contribution
of RIAFs is subdominant and their neutrino production efficiency can remain
low, consistent with their non-detection by IceCube to date.

landscape. For many companies today, moving their entire infrastructure and
workloads to the cloud reduces complexity, time to deployment, and saves money.
Spot Instances, a subset of Amazon's cloud computing infrastructure (EC2),
expands on this. They allow a user to bid on spare compute capacity in Amazon's
data centres at heavily discounted prices. If demand was ever to increase such
that the user's maximum bid is exceeded, their instance is terminated.
  In this paper, we conduct one of the first detailed analyses of how location
affects the overall cost of deployment of a spot instance. We analyse pricing
data across all available Amazon Web Services regions for 60 days for a variety
of spot instance types. We relate the data we find to the overall AWS region as
well as to the Availability Zone within that region.
  We conclude that location does play a critical role in spot instance pricing
and also that pricing differs depending on the granularity of that location -
from a more coarse-grained AWS region to a more fine-grained Availability Zone
within a region. We relate the pricing differences we find to the price's
reliability, confirming whether one can be confident in the prices reported and
subsequently, in the ensuing bids one makes.
  We conclude by showing that it is possible to run workloads on Spot Instances
achieving both a very low risk of termination as well as paying very low
amounts per hour.

it opens opportunities to expand the model using elements from other resources,

linewidths measured at 50% of the peak flux W_50 /2 (from the hydrodynamical

contributing processes. 1) Lower mass galaxies are less rotationally supported.
This is confirmed observationally from the skewness of linewidths in bins of HI
mass in both ALFALFA and HIPASS observations. 2) The HI distributions are less
extended (relative to the dark matter halo) in dwarf galaxies. Coupled to the
lower baryon-to-halo ratio results in rotation curves that are still rising at
the last measured data point, in agreement with observations from SPARC.
Combining these two effects, in both simulations and observations lower mass
galaxies have on average lower W_50 / W_20. Additionally, mass loss driven by
supernovae and projection effects (dwarf galaxies are in general not thin
disks) further reduce the linewidths. The implied HI linewidth velocity
function from NIHAO is in good agreement with observations in the nearby

domain. Here, we formulate a consistent time domain theory of the generation
and sampling of few-cycle and subcycle pulsed squeezed states, allowing for a
relativistic interpretation in terms of induced changes in the local flow of
time. Our theory enables the use of such states as a resource for novel
ultrafast applications in quantum optics and quantum information.

accurate but statistically correlated simplified or reduced models, in order to
accelerate the estimation of statistics of high-fidelity models without
compromising the accuracy of the estimates. This approach has recently gained
widespread attention in uncertainty quantification. This is partly due to the
availability of optimal strategies for the estimation of the expectation of
scalar quantities-of-interest. In practice, the optimal strategy for the
expectation is also used for the estimation of variance and sensitivity
indices. However, a general strategy is still lacking for vector-valued
problems, nonlinearly statistically-dependent models, and estimators for which
a closed-form expression of the error is unavailable. The focus of the present
work is to generalize the standard multifidelity estimators to the above cases.
The proposed generalized estimators lead to an optimization problem that can be
solved analytically and whose coefficients can be estimated numerically with
few runs of the high- and low-fidelity models. We analyze the performance of
the proposed approach on a selected number of experiments, with a particular
focus on cardiac electrophysiology, where a hierarchy of physics-based

broadening, up to 2270 km/s. An ionization stratification (higher line shift at
higher ionization potential) implies that we see a large-scale outflow rather
than single, localized jet-cloud interactions. Similarly, the paucity of
zero-velocity [OIII]$\lambda$5007 emitting gas implies the absence of a second
narrow-line region (NLR) component at rest, and therefore a large part of the
high-ionization NLR is affected by the outflow. Given the radio loudness of
these NLS1 galaxies, the observations are consistent with a pole on view onto
their central engines, so that the effects of polar outflows are maximized. In
addition, a very efficient driving mechanism is required, to reach the high
observed velocities. We explore implications from recent hydrodynamic
simulations of the interaction between fast winds or jets with the large-scale

in five transnational organizations, the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs).
Each of these RIRs manage the address pool for a large number of countries.
Because the RIRs are private organizations, they are subject to the legal
framework of the country where they are based. This configuration results in a
jurisdictional overflow from the legal framework of the countries where the RIR
is based to all the countries that the RIRs are serving (the countries served
by the RIRs de facto become subjects of the legal system of the country where
the RIR is hosted). The situation is aggravated by the deployment of new
security techniques such as the RPKI and BGPsec, that enable enforcement of
allocations by the RIRs. In this paper we present InBlock, a blockchain-based
distributed governance body aimed to provide de-centralized management of IP
addresses. InBlock also aims to fulfil the same objectives as the current IP
address allocation system, namely, uniqueness, fairness, conservation,
aggregation, registration and minimized overhead. InBlock is implemented as a
Decentralized Autonomous Organization, i.e., as a set of blockchain's smart
contracts in Ethereum. Any entity may request an allocation of addresses to the
InBlock registry by solely performing a (crypto)currency transfer to the
InBlock. The fee required, along with the annual renewal fee, serves as a
mechanism to deter stockpiling and other wasteful practices. As with any novel
technology, there are many open questions about the usage of blockchains to
build an IP address registry. For this reason, we believe that practical
experimentation is required in order to have hands-on experiences about such a
system. We propose to conduct an experiment on distributed address management
using InBlock as a starting point to inform future directions in this area.

transverse modes with an interesting gap in momentum space developing in the

holographic bottom-up models, and it is strikingly similar to the gap in
liquids in several respects. Firstly, the appropriately defined relaxation time
in the holographic models decreases with temperature in the same way. More
importantly, the holographic $k$-gap increases with temperature and with the
inverse of the relaxation time. Our results suggest that the Maxwell-Frenkel
approach to liquids, involving the additivity of liquid hydrodynamic and
solid-like elastic responses, can be applicable to a much wider class of
physical systems and effects than thought previously, including relativistic
models and strongly-coupled quantum field theories. More precisely, the
dispersion relation of the propagating shear waves is in perfect agreement with
the Maxwell-Frenkel approach. On the contrary the relaxation time appearing in
the holographic models considered does not match the Maxwell prediction in
terms of the shear viscosity and the instantaneous elastic modulus but it
shares the same temperature dependence.

three previously reported. Reoccurring separations between these modes leads us
to suggest a large frequency separation, $\Delta\nu$, of 78.9 $\mu$Hz, twice
that reported in the literature. Other frequency separations we detect may
represent the small frequency separation, $\delta\nu$, but this is inconclusive
at this stage due to magnetic perturbation of the frequencies. Due to the
highly non-linear pulsation in 33 Lib, we identify harmonics to four times the
principal frequency. Furthermore, we note a unique occurrence of non-linear
interactions of the 11 identified modes. The frequency separations of the modes
around the principal frequency are replicated around the first harmonic, with
some interaction with the second harmonic also. Such a phenomenon has not been
seen in roAp stars before. With revised stellar parameters, linear
non-adiabatic modelling of 33 Lib shows that the pulsations are not greater
than the acoustic cutoff frequency, and that the $\kappa$-mechanism can excite
the observed modes. Our observations are consistent with 33 Lib having a
rotation period much larger than 88 d as presented in the literature.

particular, the demand of scoring of natural language responses has created a
need for tools that can be applied to automatically grade these responses. In
this paper, we focus on the concept of automatic grading of short answer
questions such as are typical in the UK GCSE system, and providing useful
feedback on their answers to students. We present experimental results on a
dataset provided from the introductory computer science class in the University
of North Texas. We first apply standard data mining techniques to the corpus of
student answers for the purpose of measuring similarity between the student
answers and the model answer. This is based on the number of common words. We
then evaluate the relation between these similarities and marks awarded by
scorers. We then consider an approach that groups student answers into
clusters. Each cluster would be awarded the same mark, and the same feedback
given to each answer in a cluster. In this manner, we demonstrate that clusters
indicate the groups of students who are awarded the same or the similar scores.
Words in each cluster are compared to show that clusters are constructed based
on how many and which words of the model answer have been used. The main
novelty in this paper is that we design a model to predict marks based on the
similarities between the student answers and the model answer.

  Environment",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper looks into the problem of grasping unknown objects in a cluttered
environment using 3D point cloud data obtained from a range or an RGBD sensor.
The objective is to identify graspable regions and detect suitable grasp poses
from a single view, possibly, partial 3D point cloud without any apriori
knowledge of the object geometry. The problem is solved in two steps: (1)
identifying and segmenting various object surfaces and, (2) searching for
suitable grasping handles on these surfaces by applying geometric constraints
of the physical gripper. The first step is solved by using a modified version
of region growing algorithm that uses a pair of thresholds for smoothness
constraint on local surface normals to find natural boundaries of object
surfaces. In this process, a novel concept of edge point is introduced that
allows us to segment between different surfaces of the same object. The second
step is solved by converting a 6D pose detection problem into a 1D linear
search problem by projecting 3D cloud points onto the principal axes of the
object surface. The graspable handles are then localized by applying physical
constraints of the gripper. The resulting method allows us to grasp all kinds
of objects including rectangular or box-type objects with flat surfaces which
have been difficult so far to deal with in the grasping literature. The
proposed method is simple and can be implemented in real-time and does not
require any off-line training phase for finding these affordances. The
improvements achieved is demonstrated through comparison with another
state-of-the-art grasping algorithm on various publicly-available and
self-created datasets.

  evolutive differential inclusions",,,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ageing's sensitivity to natural selection has long been discussed because of
its apparent negative effect on individual's fitness. Thanks to the recently
described (Smurf) 2-phase model of ageing we were allowed to propose a fresh
angle for modeling the evolution of ageing. Indeed, by coupling a dramatic loss
of fertility with a high-risk of impending death - amongst other multiple
so-called hallmarks of ageing - the Smurf phenotype allowed us to consider
ageing as a couple of sharp transitions. The birth-death model (later called
bd-model) we describe here is a simple life-history trait model where each
asexual and haploid individual is described by its fertility period $x_b$ and
survival period $x_d$. We show that, thanks to the Lansing effect, $x_b$ and
$x_d$ converge during evolution to configurations $x_b-x_d\approx 0$. This
guarantees that a certain proportion of the population maintains the Lansing
effect which in turn, confers higher evolvability to individuals. \\To do so,
we built an individual-based stochastic model which describes the age and trait
distribution dynamics of such a finite population. Then we rigorously derive
the adaptive dynamics models, which describe the trait dynamics at the
evolutionary time-scale. We extend the Trait Substitution Sequence with age
structure to take into account the Lansing effect. Finally, we study the
limiting behaviour of this jump process when mutations are small. We show that
the limiting behaviour is described by a differential inclusion whose solutions
$x(t)=(x_b(t),x_d(t))$ reach the diagonal $\lbrace x_b=x_d\rbrace$ in finite
time and then remain on it. This differential inclusion is a natural way to
extend the canonical equation of adaptive dynamics in order to take into
account the lack of regularity of the invasion fitness function on the diagonal
$\lbrace x_b=x_d\rbrace$.

high-resolution 1D hydrodynamic simulations (using Pluto code) and subsequently
calculate the radiation from the remnant. The equations are solved in the test

of the shock: damped magnetic field which accounts for the damping of strong
magnetic turbulence downstream, and transported magnetic field. Neither of

onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is the chief cause of dementia, leading
to reduced cognitive capacity and autonomy and increased mortality risk. More
recently, researchers have sought to investigate whether TBI experienced in
early-life may influence trajectories of cognitive dysfunction in adulthood. It
has been speculated that early-life participation in collision sports may lead
to poor cognitive and mental health outcomes. However, to date, the few studies
to investigate this relationship have produced mixed results. We propose to
extend this literature by conducting a prospective study on the effects of
early-life participation in collision sports on later-life cognitive health
using the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study on Aging (SATSA). The SATSA is unique in
its sampling of monozygotic and dizygotic twins reared together (respectively
MZT, DZT) and twins reared apart (respectively MZA, DZA). The proposed analysis
is a prospective study of 660 individuals comprised of 270 twin pairs and 120
singletons. Seventy-eight (11.8% individuals reported participation in
collision sports. Our primary outcome will be an indicator of cognitive
impairment determined by scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). We
will also consider several secondary cognitive outcomes including verbal and
spatial ability, memory, and processing speed. Our sample will be restricted to
individuals with at least one MMSE score out of seven repeated assessments
spaced approximately three years apart. We will adjust for age, sex, and
education in each of our models.

discover invariances in the responses of hidden layer units of deep neural
networks. Our approach is based on simultaneously searching for a batch of
images that strongly activate a unit while at the same time being as distinct
from each other as possible. We find that even early convolutional layers in
VGG-19 exhibit various forms of response invariance: near-perfect phase
invariance in some units and invariance to local diffeomorphic transformations
in others. At the same time, we uncover representational differences with
ResNet-50 in its corresponding layers. We conclude that invariance
transformations are a major computational component learned by DNNs and we
provide a systematic method to study them.

Coupled Atmosphere Biogeochemistry model to investigate the coupling between
the biosphere, geosphere and atmosphere to gain deeper insight into the
atmospheric evolution of Earth-like planets orbiting M-dwarfs. Our main goal is
to understand better atmospheric processes affecting biosignatures and climate
on such worlds. Furthermore, this is the first study to our knowledge which
applies an automated chemical pathway analysis quantifying the production and
destruction pathways of O$_2$ for an Earth-like planet with an Archean O$_2$
abundance orbiting in the habitable zone of the M-dwarf AD Leo. Results suggest
that the main production arises in the upper atmosphere from CO$_2$ photolysis
followed by catalytic HO$_x$ reactions. The strongest destruction does not take
place in the troposphere, as was the case in Gebauer et al. (2017) for an
early-Earth analog planet around the Sun, but instead in the middle atmosphere
where H$_2$O photolysis is the strongest. This result was driven by the strong
Lyman-$\alpha$-radiation output of AD Leo, which efficiently photolyzes H$_2$O.
Results further suggest that early Earth-like atmospheres of planets orbiting
an M-dwarf like AD Leo are in absolute terms less destructive for atmospheric
O$_2$ than for early-Earth analog planets around the Sun despite higher
concentrations of reduced gases such as e.g. H$_2$, CH$_4$ and CO. Hence the
net primary productivity (NPP) required to produce the same amount of
atmospheric O$_2$ at the surface is reduced. This implies that a possible Great
Oxidation event, analogous to that on Earth, would have occurred earlier in
time in analog atmospheres around M-dwarfs.

connection functions. We adopt a general non-uniform density which can model
the stationary distribution of different mobility models, with the interesting
case being when the density goes to zero along the boundaries. The global
connectivity properties of these non-uniform networks are likely to be
determined by highly isolated nodes, where isolation can be caused by the
spatial distribution or the local geometry (boundaries). We extend the analysis
to temporal-spatial networks where we fix the underlying non-uniform
distribution of points and the dynamics are caused by the temporal variations
in the link set, and explore the probability a node near the corner is isolated
at time $T$. This work allows for insight into how non-uniformity (caused by
mobility) and boundaries impact the connectivity features of temporal-spatial
networks. We provide a simple method for approximating these probabilities for
a range of different connection functions and verify them against simulations.
Boundary nodes are numerically shown to dominate the connectivity properties of
these finite networks with non-uniform measure.

to unveil the physical properties of WASP-17b through an accurate measurement
of the sodium absorption in the transmission spectrum. We analyze 37

model the effects of differential limb-darkening, and the changing planetary
radial velocity on the light curves. We also analyze the sodium absorption
directly in the transmission spectrum, which is obtained through dividing
in-transit by out-of-transit spectra (i.e., the division approach). We then
compare our measurements with a radiative transfer atmospheric model. Our
analysis results in a tentative detection of exoplanetary sodium: we measure
the width and amplitude of the exoplanetary sodium feature to be

and improve the scaling of orbital space variational Monte Carlo (VMC). First,
we show that by appropriately screening the one- and two-electron integrals of
the Hamiltonian one can improve the efficiency of the algorithm by several
orders of magnitude. This improved efficiency comes with the added benefit that
the resulting algorithm scales as the second power of the system size $O(N^2)$,
down from the fourth power $O(N^4)$. Using numerical results, we demonstrate
that the practical scaling obtained is in fact $O(N^{1.5})$ for a chain of
Hydrogen atoms, and $O(N^{1.2})$ for the Hubbard model. Second, we introduce
the use of the rejection-free continuous time Monte Carlo (CTMC) to sample the
determinants. CTMC is usually prohibitively expensive because of the need to
calculate a large number of intermediates. Here, we take advantage of the fact
that these intermediates are already calculated during the evaluation of the
local energy and consequently, just by storing them one can use the CTCM
algorithm with virtually no overhead. Third, we show that by using the adaptive
stochastic gradient descent algorithm called AMSGrad one can optimize the
wavefunction energies robustly and efficiently. The combination of these three
improvements allows us to calculate the ground state energy of a chain of 160
hydrogen atoms using a wavefunction containing $\sim 2\times 10^5$ variational
parameters with an accuracy of 1 $mE_h$/particle at a cost of just 25 CPU
hours, which when split over 2 nodes of 24 processors each amounts to only
about half hour of wall time. This low cost coupled with embarrassing
parallelizability of the VMC algorithm and great freedom in the forms of usable
wavefunctions, represents a highly effective method for calculating the
electronic structure of model and \emph{ab initio} systems.

shown that the interplay between interfacial and ordering energies, plus active

heterogeneously nucleated on a pre-existing copper-rich precipitate exceeds the
energy penalty of a predominantly Fe/Cu interface, leading to initial
appendage, rather than core-shell, formation. Diffusion of Mn, Ni and Si around

of about 0.1 - 0.4 GK. During these events, 10-7 - 10-3 Msun enriched in
intermediate-mass elements (with respect to solar abundances) are ejected into
the interstellar medium. However, the origin of the large metallicity
enhancements and the inhomogeneous distribution of chemical species observed in
high-resolution spectra of ejected nova shells is not fully understood. Aims.
Recent multidimensional simulations have demonstrated that Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities that operate at the core-envelope interface can naturally produce
self-enrichment of the accreted envelope with material from the underlying
white dwarf at levels that agree with observations. However, such
multidimensional simulations have been performed for a small number of cases,
and much of the parameter space remains unexplored. Methods. Here we
investigate the dredge-up, driven by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, for white
dwarf masses in the range 0.8-1.25 Msun and different core compositions
(CO-rich and ONe-rich substrates). We present a set of five numerical
simulations performed in two dimensions aimed at analyzing the possible impact
of the white dwarf mass (and composition) on the metallicity enhancement and on
the explosion characteristics. Results. We observe greater mixing (about 30 per
cent higher when measured in the same conditions), at the time we stop the
simulations, and more energetic outbursts for ONe-rich substrates than for
CO-rich substrates and for more massive white dwarfs.

manipulation and magnetic-trapping experiments of paramagnetic atoms and
molecules. The 0.49 m MTZD consists of a combination of a 2D magnetic
quadrupole guide and deceleration coils, which together produce an array of 3D
magnetic traps. The design is based on that of Trimeche et al. with significant
modifications. The 2D quadrupole is driven by fast rising and falling square
pulses of current (up to 700 A) of arbitrary lengths of time. The traps can be
made to move at velocities from ca. 370 m/s down to zero, which is done by
driving through the deceleration coils a sinusoidal current with frequencies
ranging from zero to ca. 9 kHz and peak currents up to 1000 A. The trap
velocity is proportional to the current frequency. The MTZD manipulates the
velocities of molecular beams by traveling initially at the same velocity as
the beam. 3D guiding is achieved with a constant current frequency and
deceleration is achieved with a downward chirp of the current frequency at a
rate corresponding to the desired deceleration. We explain the technical design
and operation principles of the MTZD and we detail the custom power electronics
that drive the 2D quadrupole guide and the decelerator coils. We present
extensive Monte-Carlo trajectory simulations to demonstrate the properties of
the MTZD and we conclude that decelerations should be kept below 30000 m/s/s to
maintain a good 6D phase-space acceptance. In proof-of-principle experiments,
with the deceleration coils operating with a reduced current in the range
100-200 A, we demonstrate the 3D guiding of a beam of metastable argon atoms at
373 m/s and deceleration at 25000 m/s/s from 342 m/s to 304 m/s. The
deceleration corresponds to the removal of 21% of the kinetic energy of the

able to explore the full concentration range, while the real samples were only
obtained for 0 <= x <= 0.7. The calculated magnetic moments, Curie

decrease with increasing Co concentration. Co substitution allows for tuning
the Curie temperature in a wide range of values, from about six hundred to zero
kelvins. As the MAE depends on the electronic structure in the vicinity of
Fermi energy, the geometry of the Fermi surface of Fe$_5$PB$_2$ and the
k-resolved contributions to the MAE are discussed. Low temperature measurements
of an effective anisotropy constant for a series of
(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_5$PB$_2$ samples determined the highest value of 0.94 MJ
m$^{-3}$ for the terminal Fe$_5$PB$_2$ composition, which then decreases with
increasing Co concentration, thus confirming the computational result that Co
alloying of Fe$_5$PB$_2$ is not a good strategy to increase the MAE of the

reveals that a reduction in the magnetic moment of Fe$_5$PB$_2$, by about 25%,
produces a fourfold increase of the MAE. Furthermore, calculations for
(Fe$_{0.95}$X$_{0.05}$)$_5$PB$_2$ (X = 5$d$ element) indicate that 5% doping of

refine the structural and photometric properties of Dra II: the distribution of
stars in colour-magnitude space implies Dra II is old (13.5 $ \pm 0.5 $ Gyr),
very metal poor, very faint ($ L_V = 180 ^{+124}_{-72} L_\odot $), and at a

Pristine photometry confirms this very low metallicity ([Fe/H]$ = -2.7 \pm 0.1$
dex). Even though our study benefits from a doubling of the spectroscopic
sample size compared to previous investigations, the velocity dispersion of the
system is still only marginally resolved ($\sigma_{vr}<5.9$ km s$^{-1}$ at the
95 per cent confidence level) and confirms that Dra II is a dynamically cold
stellar system with a large recessional velocity ($\langle v_{r}\rangle =
-342.5^{+1.1}_{-1.2} $ km s$^{-1}$). We further show that the spectroscopically
confirmed members of Dra~II have a mean proper motion of
$(\mu_\alpha^*,\mu_\delta)=(1.26 \pm 0.27,0.94 \pm 0.28) $ mas yr$^{-1}$ in the
Gaia DR2 data, which translates to an orbit with a pericenter and an apocenter

altogether, these properties favour the scenario of Dra~II being a potentially

effect has been detected in QWs of 20 nm thickness with inverted band structure
and a rather low mobility of about 3 $\times$ 10$^5$ cm$^2$/V s. In a number of
other structures with QW widths ranging from 5 to 20 nm and lower mobility we
observed an unconventional non-oscillatory photoconductivity signal which
changes its sign upon magnetic field increase. This effect was observed in
structures characterized by both normal and inverted band ordering, as well as
in QWs with critical thickness and linear dispersion. In samples having Hall
bar and Corbino geometries an increase of the magnetic field resulted in a
single and double change of the sign of the photoresponse, respectively. We
show that within the bolometric mechanism of the photoresponse these unusual
features imply a non-monotonic behavior of the transport scattering rate, which
should decrease (increase) with temperature for magnetic fields below (above)
the certain value. This behavior is found to be consistent with the results of
dark transport measurements of magnetoresistivity at different sample
temperatures. Our experiments demonstrate that photoconductivity is a very
sensitive probe of the temperature variations of the transport characteristics,

the description of low-energy graphene. We provide a $4$-band short range

first model plus a narrow reflection component, and (iii) the second model with
an additional relativistic broadened reflection. The Bayesian evidence for the
full sample of sources selects the model with the additional broad component as
being 10^5 times more probable to describe the data better than the second
model. For the two brightest sources in our sample, CID 190 (z=0.734) and CID
104 (z=0.543), BXA reveals the relativistic signatures in the individual
spectra. We estimate the fraction of sources containing a broad component to be
54^{+35}_{-37}% (107/199 sources). Considering that the low signal-to-noise
ratio of some spectra prevents the detection of the broad iron K alpha line, we
infer an intrinsic fraction with broad emission of around two thirds. The
detection of relativistic signatures in the X-ray spectra of these sources
suggests that they are powered by a radiatively efficient accretion disk.
Preliminary evidence is found that the spin of the black hole is high, with a
maximally spinning Kerr BH model (a=1) providing a significantly better fit
than a Schwarzschild model (a=0). Our analysis demonstrate the potential of
X-ray spectroscopy to measure this key parameter in typical SMBH systems at the

role for the ferromagnetic coupling between Cr ions. We observe that the
bandgaps and the interlayer magnetic order vary notably depending on the
magnitude of on-site Coulomb interaction $U$ for Cr $d$ electrons. The bandgaps
are formed between the Cr $e_{\mathrm{g}}$ conduction bands and the Te $p$
valence bands for both CrSiTe$_3$ and CrGeTe$_3$ in the majority-spin channel.
The dominant Te $p$ antibonding character in the valence bands just below the
Fermi level is related to the decrease of the bandgap for the increase of $U$.
We elucidate the energy band diagram, which may serve to understand the
electronic and magnetic properties of the $ABX_3$-type transition metal
tri-chalcogenides in general.

They have a typical wavelength of about 1.2{\deg} (1400 km), variable-length

General Circulation Model simulations generate inertia-gravity waves from
vortices interacting with the environment and can reproduce the observed

main aspects affecting its performance is the way resources are allocated.
Allocations can be either managed by the network or in a distributed way,

refine the solution. This led to solutions in greater agreement with manual
segmentation than the standard Morel atlas based approach. Furthermore, we show
that the multi-contrast approach boosts segmentation performances. We then
investigated whether prior knowledge using the training-template contours could
further improve convex segmentation accuracy and robustness, which led to
highly precise multi-contrast segmentations in single subjects. This approach
can be extended to most 3D imaging data types and any region of interest
discernible in single scans or multi-subject templates.

inability of Markov models to capture criticality in human mobility. In
particular, the assumed Markovian nature of mobility was used to establish a
theoretical upper bound on the predictability of human mobility (expressed as a
minimum error probability limit), based on temporally correlated entropy. Since
its inception, this bound has been widely used and empirically validated using
Markov chains. We show that recurrent-neural architectures can achieve
significantly higher predictability, surpassing this widely used upper bound.
In order to explain this anomaly, we shed light on several underlying
assumptions in previous research works that has resulted in this bias. By
evaluating the mobility predictability on real-world datasets, we show that
human mobility exhibits scale-invariant long-range correlations, bearing
similarity to a power-law decay. This is in contrast to the initial assumption
that human mobility follows an exponential decay. This assumption of
exponential decay coupled with Lempel-Ziv compression in computing Fano's
inequality has led to an inaccurate estimation of the predictability upper
bound. We show that this approach inflates the entropy, consequently lowering
the upper bound on human mobility predictability. We finally highlight that
this approach tends to overlook long-range correlations in human mobility. This
explains why recurrent-neural architectures that are designed to handle
long-range structural correlations surpass the previously computed upper bound
on mobility predictability.

between radio and X-rays, with radio brightness declining more steeply than the
X-ray brightness. This trend is opposite to that generally observed in giant
radio halos, thus marking a possible difference in the physics of the two radio

role in multiple modern disciplines, from Cooper pairing of electrons in
superconductivity to formation of supramolecules in biochemistry. Optical
solitons, which are analogous in many ways to particles, arise from a balance
between nonlinearity and dispersion and have only been known to be able to form
molecule-like, localized structures through covalent interactions due to direct
overlapping. Non-covalent binding of optical solitons that based on long-rang
interactions have, however, so far escaped experimental observations.
Long-range interactions between optical solitons have proven almost impossible
to control, generally leading to disorder. In this paper, however we show that
by tailoring weak, long-range soliton interactions, a large population of
optical solitons in an optoacoustic mode-locking fiber laser can assemble into
stable, highly-ordered structures that resemble biochemical supramolecules. We

stochastic elasticity. For the deterministic elastic problem, involving
homogeneous isotropic incompressible hyperelastic spheres under radially
symmetric tension, there is a critical dead-load traction at which cavitation
can occur for some materials. In addition to the well-known case of stable
cavitation post-bifurcation at the critical dead load, we show the existence of
unstable snap cavitation for some isotropic materials satisfying Baker-Ericksen
inequalities. For the stochastic problem, we derive the probability
distribution of the deformations after bifurcation. In this case, we find that,
due to the probabilistic nature of the material parameters, there is always a
competition between the stable and unstable states. Therefore, at a critical
load, stable or unstable cavitation occurs with a given probability, and there
is also a probability that the cavity may form under smaller or greater loads
than the expected critical value. We refer to these phenomena as `likely
cavitation'. Moreover, we provide examples of homogeneous isotropic
incompressible materials exhibiting stable or unstable cavitation together with
their stochastic equivalent.

Stomatopods or the shell of bivalve mollusks, the defining functional and
structural properties are determined by locally varying orientations of
inorganic building blocks within each layer. One approach to artificially
produce textured microstructures inspired by such complex composites is
magnetically assisted slip-casting (MASC). MASC is a colloidal process in which
anisotropic particles are oriented at arbitrarily defined angles using a
magnetic field. The orientation of the particles is maintained during growth as
particles are collected from the wall of a porous mold. Whereas a number of
proof-of-concept studies have established the potential of the technique, the
full design space available for MASC-fabricated structures, and the limits of
the approach, have so far not been explored in a systematic manner. To fill
this gap, we have studied both theoretically and experimentally the various
torques that act on the particles at different stage of the assembly process.
We define the boundary conditions of the MASC process for magnetically
responsive alumina platelets suspended in a low-viscosity aqueous suspension,
considering the composition of the colloidal suspension and the dynamics of the
particle-alignment process under a rotating magnetic field. Taken together,
these findings define a design strategy for the fabrication of designed
multi-lamellar microstructures using MASC. Our guidelines are based on a
comprehensive understanding of the physical mechanisms governing the
orientation and assembly of anisotropic particles during MASC and indicate a
route to expanding this technique to building blocks of various chemistries,
and thus to broadening the range of bio-inspired composites with customized
multi-scale structures that can be produced for specific applications.

  environment",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this article we study the stabilizing of a primitive pattern of behaviour
for the two-species community with chemotaxis due to the short-wavelength
external signal. We use a system of Patlak-Keller-Segel type as a model of the
community. It is well-known that such systems can produce complex unsteady
patterns of behaviour which are usually explained mathematically by
bifurcations of some basic solutions that describe simpler patterns. As far as
we aware, all such bifurcations in the models of the Patlak-Keller-Segel type
had been found for homogeneous (i.e. translationally invariant) systems where
the basic solutions are equilibria with homogeneous distributions of all
species. The model considered in the present paper does not possess the
translational invariance: one of species (the predators) is assumed to be
capable of moving in response to a signal produced externally in addition to
the signal emitted by another species (the prey). For instance, the external
signal may arise from the inhomogeneity of the distribution of an environmental
characteristic such as temperature, salinity, terrain relief, etc. Our goal is
to examine the effect of short-wavelength inhomogeneity. To do this, we employ
a certain homogenization procedure. We separate the short-wavelength and smooth
components of the system response and derive a slow system governing the latter
one. Analysing the slow system and comparing it with the case of homogeneous
environment shows that, generically, a short-wavelength inhomogeneity results
in an exponential decrease in the motility of the predators. The loss of
motility prevents, to a great extent, the occurrence of complex unsteady
patterns and dramatically stabilizes the primitive basic solution. In some
sense, the necessity of dealing with intensive small-scale changes of the
environment makes the system unable to respond to other challenges.

to recognize human's emotional states only considering a single modality.
Second, it is expensive to manually annotate the emotional data. Third,
emotional data often suffers from missing modalities due to unforeseeable

problems under a novel multi-view deep generative framework. Specifically, we
propose to model the statistical relationships of multi-modality emotional data
using multiple modality-specific generative networks with a shared latent
space. By imposing a Gaussian mixture assumption on the posterior approximation
of the shared latent variables, our framework can learn the joint deep
representation from multiple modalities and evaluate the importance of each
modality simultaneously. To solve the labeled-data-scarcity problem, we extend
our multi-view model to semi-supervised learning scenario by casting the
semi-supervised classification problem as a specialized missing data imputation
task. To address the missing-modality problem, we further extend our
semi-supervised multi-view model to deal with incomplete data, where a missing
view is treated as a latent variable and integrated out during inference. This
way, the proposed overall framework can utilize all available (both labeled and
unlabeled, as well as both complete and incomplete) data to improve its
generalization ability. The experiments conducted on two real multi-modal
emotion datasets demonstrated the superiority of our framework.

matching between the region of interest (ROI) in the query image and the whole
target image for similarity computation. Due to the inconsistency in the visual
appearance, this practice tends to degrade the retrieval accuracy particularly
when the image ROI, which is usually interpreted as the image objectness,
accounts for a smaller region in the image. Since Privileged Information (PI),
which can be viewed as the image prior, enables well characterizing the image
objectness, we are aiming at leveraging PI for further improving the
performance of the multi-view re-ranking accuracy in this paper. Towards this
end, we propose a discriminative multi-view re-ranking approach in which both
the original global image visual contents and the local auxiliary PI features
are simultaneously integrated into a unified training framework for generating
the latent subspaces with sufficient discriminating power. For the on-the-fly
re-ranking, since the multi-view PI features are unavailable, we only project
the original multi-view image representations onto the latent subspace, and
thus the re-ranking can be achieved by computing and sorting the distances from
the multi-view embeddings to the separating hyperplane. Extensive experimental
evaluations on the two public benchmarks Oxford5k and Paris6k reveal our
approach provides further performance boost for accurate image re-ranking,
whilst the comparative study demonstrates the advantage of our method against
other multi-view re-ranking methods.

second round. In this paper, we discuss the possibility of matches with limited
importance (called non-competitive) for final group standing for both 4-team
and 3-team groups and we introduce our definitions of collusion and dead rubber
games. Next, we discuss scenarios in both 4-team and 3-team group formats that

that this variation has the potential of reducing significantly the number of
both collusion and dead rubber matches thus becoming an interesting option to
be considered for adoption by FIFA. In conclusion, we recommend FIFA to
implement a predefined order of group matches prior to the drawing. The seeded
