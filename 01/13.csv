reconstruction algorithms. While noise models are well known for traditional
imaging techniques, the noise distribution of a novel sensor may be difficult
to determine a priori. Therefore, we propose learning arbitrary noise
distributions. To do so, this paper proposes a fully connected neural network
model to map samples from a uniform distribution to samples of any explicitly
known probability density function. During the training, the Jensen-Shannon
divergence between the distribution of the model's output and the target
distribution is minimized. We experimentally demonstrate that our model
converges towards the desired state. It provides an alternative to existing
sampling methods such as inversion sampling, rejection sampling, Gaussian
mixture models and Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo. Our model has high sampling
efficiency and is easily applied to any probability distribution, without the
need of further analytical or numerical calculations.

from malaria and arboviral diseases. In Kedougou (Senegal), these illnesses are
all endemic due to the climate and its geographical position. The
co-circulation of malaria parasites and arboviruses can explain the observation
of coinfected cases. Indeed there is strong resemblance in symptoms between
these diseases making problematic targeted medical care of coinfected cases.
This is due to the fact that the origin of illness is not obviously known. Some
cases could be immunized against one or the other of the pathogens, immunity
typically acquired with factors like age and exposure as usual for endemic
area. Then, coinfection needs to be better diagnosed. Using data collected from
patients in Kedougou region, from 2009 to 2013, we adjusted a multinomial
logistic model and selected relevant variables in explaining coinfection
status. We observed specific sets of variables explaining each of the diseases
exclusively and the coinfection. We tested the independence between arboviral
and malaria infections and derived coinfection probabilities from the model
fitting. In case of a coinfection probability greater than a threshold value to
be calibrated on the data, duration of illness above 3 days and age above 10
years-old are mostly indicative of arboviral disease while body temperature
higher than 40{\textdegree}C and presence of nausea or vomiting symptoms during
the rainy season are mostly indicative of malaria disease.

In
this paper, we investigate the extinction properties of dust formed in the type
IIn SN 2005ip. The observed light curves of SN 2005ip all exhibit a sudden drop
around 50 days after discovery. This has been attributed to dust formation in
the dense circumstellar medium. We modeled the intrinsic light curves in six
optical bands, adopting a theoretical model for the luminosity evolution of
supernovae interacting with their circumstellar material. From the difference
between the observed and intrinsic light curves, we calculated extinction
curves as a function of time. The total-to-selective extinction ratio, $R_V$,
was determined from the extinction in the B and V bands. The resulting
extinction, $A_V$, increases monotonically up to about 1 mag, 150 days after
discovery. The inferred $R_V$ value also increases slightly with time, but
appears constant in the range 4.5--8, beyond 100 days after discovery. The
analysis confirms that dust is likely formed in SN 2005ip, starting about two
months after explosion. The high value of $R_V$, that is, gray dust, suggests
dust properties different from of the Milky Way. While this result hinges on
the assumed theoretical intrinsic light curve evolution, it is encouraging that
the fitted light curves are as expected for standard ejecta and circumstellar
medium density structures.

sedimentary mounds, but the connections between mound form and wind erosion are
unclear. We perform mesoscale simulations of different crater and mound
morphologies to understand the formation of sedimentary mounds. As crater depth
increases, slope winds produce increased erosion near the base of the crater
wall, forming mounds. Peak erosion rates occur when the crater depth is ~2 km.
Mound evolution depends on the size of the host crater. In smaller craters
mounds preferentially erode at the top, becoming more squat, while in larger
craters mounds become steeper-sided. This agrees with observations where
smaller craters tend to have proportionally shorter mounds, and larger craters
have mounds encircled by moats. If a large-scale sedimentary layer blankets a
crater, then as the layer recedes across the crater it will erode more towards
the edges of the crater, resulting in a crescent-shaped moat. When a 160 km
diameter mound-hosting crater is subject to a prevailing wind, the surface wind
stress is stronger on the leeward side than on the windward side. This results
in the center of the mound appearing to `march upwind' over time, and forming a
`bat-wing' shape, as is observed for Mt. Sharp in Gale crater.

we develop a biophysical model for retroviral integrations as stochastic and
quasi-equilibrium topological reconnections between polymers. We discover that
physical effects, such as DNA accessibility and elasticity, play important and
universal roles in this process. Our simulations predict that integration is
favoured within nucleosomal and flexible DNA, in line with experiments, and
that these biases arise due to competing energy barriers associated with DNA
deformations. By considering a long chromosomal region in human T-cells during
interphase, we discover that at these larger scales integration sites are
predominantly determined by chromatin accessibility. Finally, we propose and
solve a reaction-diffusion problem that recapitulates the distribution of HIV
hot-spots within T-cells. With few generic assumptions, our model can
rationalise experimental observations and identifies previously unappreciated
physical contributions to retroviral integration site selection.

Every source message must be recovered perfectly at the destination subject to

to three different types of devices (bulk, thin film, and multi-junction) we
could exploit the relationships among losses for the main three generations of

high-temperature superconductors. Unlike the pseudogap in hole-doped cuprates,
however, the pseudogap in the electron-doped counterpart has been attributed to
band folding due to short-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) order. We performed
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements on electron-doped
cuprates showing spin-glass and disordered AFM behaviors at low temperatures,
and found that the gap magnitude \textit{decreases} in the antinodal region
contrary to the hole-doped case. Moreover, the gap opening position was not
always on the AFM Brillouin zone boundary in contradiction with the requirement
of the AFM band-folding picture. These features are consistent with cluster
dynamical-mean-field-theory calculations which predict an $s$-symmetry
pseudogap that shrinks in the andinodal region. The present results support the
scenario that the proximity to the Mott insulator, without relying on the
well-developed AFM correlation, gives rise to a momentum-dependent pseudogap of
$s$-symmetry with indirect gap commonly in the electron-doped and hole-doped
cuprates, implying a universal origin of the pseudogap with a similarity to the
Mott gap formation.

applications by letting the programmer designate certain code blocks as atomic.
Programmers using a TM often would like to access the same data both inside and
outside transactions, e.g., to improve performance or to support legacy code.
In this case, programmers would ideally like the TM to guarantee strong
atomicity, where transactions can be viewed as executing atomically also with
respect to non-transactional accesses. Since guaranteeing strong atomicity for
arbitrary programs is prohibitively expensive, researchers have suggested
guaranteeing it only for certain data-race free (DRF) programs, particularly
those that follow the privatization idiom: from some point on, threads agree
that a given object can be accessed non-transactionally. Supporting
privatization safely in a TM is nontrivial, because this often requires
correctly inserting transactional fences, which wait until all active
transactions complete.
  Unfortunately, there is currently no consensus on a single definition of
transactional DRF, in particular, because no existing notion of DRF takes into
account transactional fences. In this paper we propose such a notion and prove
that, if a TM satisfies a certain condition generalizing opacity and a program
using it is DRF assuming strong atomicity, then the program indeed has strongly
atomic semantics. We show that our DRF notion allows the programmer to use
privatization idioms. We also propose a method for proving our generalization
of opacity and apply it to the TL2 TM.

future surveys. There are two main techniques to analyse a cosmic shear survey;
a tomographic method, where correlations between the lensing signal in
different redshift bins are used to recover redshift information, and a 3D
approach, where the full redshift information is carried through the entire
analysis. Here we compare the two methods, by forecasting cosmological
constraints for future surveys like Euclid. We extend the 3D formalism for the
first time to theories beyond the standard model, belonging to the Horndeski
class. This includes the majority of universally coupled extensions to
$\Lambda$CDM with one scalar degree of freedom in addition to the metric, still
in agreement with current observations. Given a fixed background, the evolution
of linear perturbations in Horndeski gravity is described by a set of four
functions of time only. We model their time evolution assuming proportionality
to the dark energy density fraction and place Fisher matrix constraints on the
proportionality coefficients. We find that a 3D analysis can constrain
Horndeski theories better than a tomographic one, in particular with a decrease
in the errors of the order of 20$\%$. This paper shows for the first time a
quantitative comparison on an equal footing between Fisher matrix forecasts for
both a fully 3D and a tomographic analysis of cosmic shear surveys. The

the squeezing in one dimension is experimentally achievable. We show that while
dipole-dipole interaction induced by ordinary vacuum depends on the emitter

positions of the emitters with respect to the squeezing sources. The dephasing
rate, decay rate and the resonance fluorescence of the waveguide-QED in the

distribution $D$. Two sub-Riemannian metrics on $(M,D)$ are said to be
projectively (resp. affinely) equivalent if they have the same geodesics up to
reparameterization (resp. up to affine reparameterization). A sub-Riemannian
metric $g$ is called rigid (resp. conformally rigid) with respect to
projective/affine equivalence, if any sub-Riemannian metric which is
projectively/affinely equivalent to $g$ is constantly proportional to $g$
(resp. conformal to $g$). In the Riemannian case the local classification of
projectively and affinely equivalent metrics is classical (Levi-Civita,
Eisenhart). In particular, a Riemannian metric which is not rigid satisfies the
following two special properties: its geodesic flow possesses nontrivial
integrals and the metric induces certain canonical product structure on the
ambient manifold. These classification results were extended to contact and
quasi-contact distributions by Zelenko. Our general goal is to extend these
results to arbitrary sub-Riemannian manifolds, and we establish two types of
results toward this goal: if a sub-Riemannian metric is not projectively
conformally rigid, then, first, its flow of normal extremals has at least one
nontrivial integral quadratic on the fibers of the cotangent bundle and,
second, the nilpotent approximation of the underlying distribution at any point
admits a product structure. As a consequence we obtain two types of genericity
results: first, we show that a generic sub-Riemannian metric on a fixed pair
$(M,D)$ is projectively conformally rigid. Second, we prove that, except for
special pairs $(m,n)$, every sub-Riemannian metric on a rank $m$ generic
distribution in an $n$-dimensional manifold is projectively conformally rigid.
For the affine equivalence in both genericity results conformal rigidity can be
replaced by usual rigidity.

a promising direction for advancing the state-of-the-art in image compression.
The key challenge in learning such networks is twofold: To deal with
quantization, and to control the trade-off between reconstruction error
(distortion) and entropy (rate) of the latent image representation. In this
paper, we focus on the latter challenge and propose a new technique to navigate
the rate-distortion trade-off for an image compression auto-encoder. The main
idea is to directly model the entropy of the latent representation by using a
context model: A 3D-CNN which learns a conditional probability model of the
latent distribution of the auto-encoder. During training, the auto-encoder
makes use of the context model to estimate the entropy of its representation,
and the context model is concurrently updated to learn the dependencies between
the symbols in the latent representation. Our experiments show that this
approach, when measured in MS-SSIM, yields a state-of-the-art image compression
system based on a simple convolutional auto-encoder.

giant branch their envelope density drops and so does the power injected
through orbital decay, scaling approximately as $L_{\rm decay} \propto
R_*^{-9/2}$. Their luminosity, however, increases along the giant branch. These
opposed scalings indicate a crossing, where $L_{\rm decay}= L_*$. We consider
the engulfment of planets along isochrones in the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R)
diagram. We find that the conditions for such a crossing occur around
$L_*\approx 10^2$~$L_\odot$ (or $a\approx 0.1$~au) for Jovian planetary
companions. The consumption of closer-in giant planets, such as hot Jupiters,
leads to $L_{\rm decay}\gg L_*$, while more distant planets such as warm
Jupiters, $a\approx 0.5$~au, lead to minor perturbations of their host stars
with $L_{\rm decay} \ll L_*$. Our results map out the parameter space along the
giant branch in the H-R Diagram where interaction with planetary companions
leads to significant energetic disturbance of host stars.

population and on its gravitational-wave-driven merger rate, by combining the
constraints on the DWD population from two previous radial-velocity-variation
studies: One based on a sample of white dwarfs (WDs) from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS, which with its low spectral resolution probes systems at
separations a<0.05 au), and one based on the ESO-VLT Supernova-Ia Progenitor
surveY (SPY, which, with high spectral resolution, is sensitive to a<4 au).
From a joint likelihood analysis, the DWD fraction among WDs is
fbin=0.095+/-0.020 (1-sigma, random) +0.010 (systematic) in the separation
range ~<4 au. The index of a power-law distribution of initial WD separations
(at the start of solely gravitational-wave-driven binary evolution), N(a)da ~
a^alpha da, is alpha=-1.30+/-0.15 (1-sigma) +0.05 (systematic). The Galactic WD
merger rate per WD is R_merge=(9.7+/-1.1)e-12 /yr. Integrated over the Galaxy
lifetime, this implies that 8.5-11 per cent of all WDs ever formed have merged
with another WD. If most DWD mergers end as more-massive WDs, then some 10 per
cent of WDs are DWD-merger products, consistent with the observed fraction of
WDs in a ""high-mass bump"" in the WD mass function. The DWD merger rate is 4.5-7
times the Milky Way's specific Type-Ia supernova (SN Ia) rate. If most SN Ia
explosions stem from the mergers of some DWDs (say, those with massive-enough
binary components) then ~15 per cent of all WD mergers must lead to a SN Ia.

galactic nucleus (AGN) on the intracluster medium in a galaxy cluster
environment with short central cooling time. We investigate appearance and
properties of the resulting cavities, and the efficiency of jets in providing
near-isotropic heating to the cooling cluster core.
  Methods: We use numerical simulations to explore four models of jets over
several active/inactive cycles. We keep the jet power and duration fixed,
varying only the jet angle prescription. We track the total energy of the
intracluster medium (ICM) in the cluster core over time, and the fraction of
the jet energy transferred to the ICM, paying attention to where the energy is
deposited. We also compare synthetic X-ray images of the simulated cluster to
actual observations.
  Results: Jets whose re-orientation is minimal ($\lesssim 20^{\circ}$)
typically produce conical structures of interconnected cavities, with the
opening angle of the cones being $\sim 15-20^{\circ}$, extending to $\sim 300$
kpc from the cluster centre. Such jets transfer about $60\%$ of their energy to
the ICM, yet they are not very efficient at heating the cluster core, as the
jet energy is deposited further out. Jets that re-orient by $\gtrsim
20^{\circ}$ generally produce multiple pairs of detached cavities. Although
smaller, these cavities are inflated within the central 50~kpc and are more
isotropically distributed, resulting in more effective heating of the core.
Such jets, over few hundreds Myr, can deposit up to $80\%$ of their energy
where it is required. Consequently, these models come the closest to an
heating/cooling balance and to mitigating runaway cooling of the core, even
though all models have identical power/duration profiles. Additionally, the
corresponding synthetic X-ray images exhibit structures closely resembling
those seen in real cool-core clusters.

$10.25<{\rm log}(M_*/M_\odot)<10.75$ and $z<0.2$ classified according to their
intrinsic $u^*-r^*$ colour. From single component S\'ersic fits, we find that
the stellar mass-sensitive $K-$band profiles of red and green galaxy
populations are very similar, while $g-$band profiles indicate more disk-like
morphologies for the green galaxies: apparent (optical) morphological
differences arise primarily from radial mass-to-light ratio variations.
Two-component fits show that most green galaxies have significant bulge and
disk components and that the blue to red evolution is driven by colour change
in the disk. Together, these strongly suggest that galaxies evolve from blue to
red through secular disk fading and that a strong bulge is present prior to any
decline in star formation. The relative abundance of the green population
implies a typical timescale for traversing the green valley $\sim 1-2$~Gyr and
is independent of environment, unlike that of the red and blue populations.
While environment likely plays a r\^ole in triggering the passage across the
green valley, it appears to have little effect on time taken. These results are
consistent with a green valley population dominated by (early type) disk
galaxies that are insufficiently supplied with gas to maintain previous levels
of disk star formation, eventually attaining passive colours. No single event
is needed quench their star formation.

the nuclei coalesced 1.8-3 Gyr ago, and where the first passage took place 7 to
10 Gyr ago at a large pericentre distance (32 kpc). We also show that within a
family of orbital parameters, the Giant Stream (GS) can be formed with various
merger mass-ratios, from 2:1 to 300:1. A recent major merger may be the only
way to create the very unusual age-dispersion relation in the disk. It
reproduces and explains the long-lived 10 kpc ring, the widespread and recent
star formation event, the absence of a remnant of the GS progenitor, the
apparent complexity of the 3D spatial distribution of the GS, the NE and G
Clumps and their formation process, and the observed slope of the halo profile.
These modelling successes lead us to propose that the bulk of the substructure

spectral analysis is performed over the broad 0.5-24 keV energy range,
combining NuSTAR with Chandra and/or XMM-Newton data and employing empirical
and physically motivated models. This constitutes the largest sample of AGN
selected at $ >10$ keV to be homogeneously spectrally analyzed at these flux
levels. We study the distribution of spectral parameters such as photon index,
column density ($N_{\rm H}$), reflection parameter ($R$) and 10-40 keV
luminosity ($L_{X}$). Heavily obscured ($\log [N_{\rm H}/cm^{-2}]\ge23$) and
Compton Thick (CT; $\log [N_{\rm H}/cm^{-2}]\ge24$) AGN constitute $\sim$25%
(15-17 sources) and $\sim$2-3% ( 1-2 sources) of the sample, respectively. The
observed $N_{\rm H}$ distribution fairly agrees with predictions of Cosmic
X-ray Background population synthesis models (CXBPSM). We estimate the
intrinsic fraction of AGN as a function of $N_{H}$, accounting for the bias
against obscured AGN in a flux-selected sample. The fraction of CT AGN relative
to $\log [N_{\rm H}/cm^{-2}]=20-24$ AGN is poorly constrainted, formally in the
range 2-56% (90% upper limit of 66%). We derived a fraction ($f_{abs}$) of
obscured AGN ($\log [N_{\rm H}/cm^{-2}]=22-24$) as a function of $L_{X}$ in
agreement with CXBPSM and previous z < 1 X-ray determinations. Furthermore
$f_{abs}$ at z=0.1-0.5 and $\log (L_{X}/erg$ $s^{-1})\approx43.6-44.3$ agrees
with observational measurements/trends obtained over larger redshift intervals.

the acceleration due to gravity ($g$) and the free-fall time ($t_{\rm ff}

is crucial because according to numerical simulations cold gas condensation and
strong feedback occur in cluster cores with min($t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}$)
below a threshold value close to 10. Recent observations which include the BCG
gravity show that the observed threshold in min($t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}$) lies
at a somewhat higher value, close to 10-30; there are only a few clusters in
which this ratio falls much below 10. In this paper we compare numerical
simulations of feedback AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei) jets interacting with the
intracluster medium (ICM), with and without a BCG potential. We find that, for
a fixed feedback efficiency, the presence of a BCG does not significantly
affect the temperature but increases (decreases) the core density (entropy) on
average. Most importantly, min($t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}$) is only affected
slightly by the inclusion of the BCG gravity. Also notable is that the lowest
value of min($t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}$) in the NFW+BCG runs are about twice
larger than in the NFW runs. We also look at the role of depletion of cold gas
due to star formation and show that it only affects the rotationally dominant
component (torus), while the radially dominant component (which regulates the
feedback cycle) remains largely unaffected. The distribution of metals due to
AGN jets in our simulations is predominantly along the jet direction and the
radial spread of metals is less. We also show that the turbulence in cool core
clusters is weak, consistent with recent Hitomi results on Perseus cluster.

maps, we examine the global and resolved star-forming main sequences of SAMI
galaxies as a function of morphology, environmental density, and stellar mass.
Galaxies further below the star-forming main sequence are more likely to have
flatter star formation profiles. Early-type galaxies split into two populations
with similar stellar masses and central stellar mass surface densities. The
main sequence population has centrally-concentrated star formation similar to
late-type galaxies, while galaxies >3{\sigma} below the main sequence show
significantly reduced star formation most strikingly in the nuclear regions.
The split populations support a two-step quenching mechanism, wherein halo mass
first cuts off the gas supply and remaining gas continues to form stars until
the local stellar mass surface density can stabilize the reduced remaining fuel
against further star formation. Across all morphologies, galaxies in denser
environments show a decreased specific star formation rate from the outside in,
supporting an environmental cause for quenching, such as ram-pressure stripping
or galaxy interactions.

Different origins for the KN ejecta may be distinguished by their predictions
for the emission in the first hours after the merger, when the luminosity is
enhanced by heating from internal shocks; the latter are likely generic to any
temporally-extended ejecta source (e.g. magnetar or accretion disk wind) and
are not unique to the emergence of a relativistic jet. The same shocks could
mix and homogenizes the composition to a low but non-zero lanthanide mass
fraction, X_La ~ 1e-3, as advocated by some authors, but only if the mixing
occurs after neutrons are consumed in the r-process on a timescale >~ 1 s.

standard interfaces for different optimal control solvers. To date, we support
Single Shooting, the iterative Linear-Quadratic Regulator, Gauss-Newton

speeds, large total column densities log N_H(cm^-2) > 23, and large kinetic
energies that could be important for feedback to the host galaxy. A UV spectrum
of PDS 456 obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope in 2000 contains one
well-measured broad absorption line (BAL) at ~1346A (observed) that might be
Ly-alpha at v ~ 0.06c or NV 1240 at v ~ 0.08c. However, we use photoionisation
models and comparisons to other outflow quasars to show that these BAL
identifications are problematic because other lines that should accompany them
are not detected. We argue that the UV BAL is probably CIV 1549 at v ~ 0.30c.
This would be the fastest UV outflow ever reported, but its speed is similar to
the X-ray outflow and its appearance overall is similar to relativistic UV BALs
observed in other quasars. The CIV BAL identification is also supported
indirectly by the tentative detection of another broad CIV line at v ~ 0.19c.
The high speeds suggest that the UV outflow originates with the X-ray UFO
crudely 20 to 30 r_g from the central black hole. We speculate that the CIV BAL
might form in dense clumps embedded in the X-ray UFO, requiring density
enhancements of only >0.4 dex compared clumpy structures already inferred for
the soft X-ray absorber in PDS 456. The CIV BAL might therefore be the first
detection of low-ionisation clumps proposed previously to boost the opacities

that the vorticity modifies significantly the modulational instability of
gravity-capillary wave trains, namely the growth rate and instability
bandwidth. It is found that the rate of growth of modulational instability of
short gravity waves influenced by surface tension behaves like pure gravity
waves: (i) in infinite depth, the growth rate is reduced in the presence of
positive vorticity and amplified in the presence of negative vorticity, (ii) in
finite depth, it is reduced when the vorticity is positive and amplified and
finally reduced when the vorticity is negative. The combined effect of

14m.7<I<20m.5. The proper motion measurements are based on several all-sky
surveys with an epoch difference of 60-70 years for the bright objects. The
proper motions allowed us to discriminate the cluster members from field
objects and resulted in 14 proper motion members of the Hyades. We rediscover
Hy 6 as a proper motion member and classify it as a substellar object candidate
(BD) based on the comparison of the observed colour-magnitude diagram with
theoretical model isochrones. With our results, the mass function of the Hyades
continues to be shallow below 0.15 $M_\odot$ indicating that the Hyades have
probably lost their lowest mass members by means of dynamical evolution. We
conclude that the Hyades core represents the `VLM/BD desert' and that most of
the substeller objects may have already left the volume of the cluster.

have been developed and widely applied since 1930's. Some methods (e.g., the
minimal $p$-value) are optimal for sparse signals, and some others (e.g.,
Fisher's combination) are optimal for dense signals. To address a wide spectrum
of signal patterns, this paper proposes a unifying family of statistics, called
TFisher, with general $p$-value truncation and weighting schemes. Analytical
calculations for the $p$-value and the statistical power of TFisher under
general hypotheses are given. Optimal truncation and weighting parameters are
studied based on Bahadur Efficiency (BE) and the proposed Asymptotic Power
Efficiency (APE), which is superior to BE for studying the signal detection
problem. A soft-thresholding scheme is shown to be optimal for signal detection
in a large space of signal patterns. When prior information of signal pattern
is unavailable, an omnibus test, oTFisher, can adapt to the given data.
Simulations evidenced the accuracy of calculations and validated the
theoretical properties. The TFisher tests were applied to analyzing a whole
exome sequencing data of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Relevant tests and
calculations have been implemented into an R package $TFisher$ and published on
the CRAN.

region is subject to a fundamental tension in which nodes individually benefit
at the expense of others. The complexity of the region depends on all the ways
of resolving this tension. Two sets of constraints define an outer-bound on the
decode-forward region: first, the conventional mutual-information inequalities
implied by the one-relay channel, and second, causality constraints that ensure
nodes only forward messages they have already decoded. The framework of flow
decomposition is introduced to show these constraints are also sufficient. Flow
decomposition provides a way of manipulating regular decode-forward schemes
without the long encoding delays and restrictions on bidirectional
communication of backward decoding. The two structures that define a flow
decomposition are flows and layerings. Flows specify the nodes which encode
messages from each source (i.e., the routes) and the encoding delays. Layerings
specify the messages decoded at a specific node in the channel. We focus on two
types of flow: hierarchical flow, with tree-like routes, and all-cast flow,
where each route covers all nodes. For arbitrary flows of either type and any
rate-vector satisfying the mutual-information constraints at a specific node,
we prove there are equivalent flows and a layering that satisfy both the
mutual-information and causality constraints. In separate work, we show that
only the mutual-information constraints are active in channels with
hierarchical flow, which implies the achievable region has minimal complexity.
In channels with all-cast flow, the achievable region is computable.

availability of practical light field capturing systems that offer a wide range
of applications in the field of computer vision. However, capturing
high-resolution light fields remains technologically challenging since the
increase in angular resolution is often accompanied by a significant reduction
in spatial resolution. This paper describes a learning-based spatial light
field super-resolution method that allows the restoration of the entire light
field with consistency across all sub-aperture images. The algorithm first uses
optical flow to align the light field and then reduces its angular dimension
using low-rank approximation. We then consider the linearly independent columns
of the resulting low-rank model as an embedding, which is restored using a deep
convolutional neural network (DCNN). The super-resolved embedding is then used
to reconstruct the remaining sub-aperture images. The original disparities are
restored using inverse warping where missing pixels are approximated using a
novel light field inpainting algorithm. Experimental results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing light field super-resolution algorithms,
achieving PSNR gains of 0.23 dB over the second best performing method. This
performance can be further improved using iterative back-projection as a
post-processing step.

Perpetual free-choice nets are free-choice Petri nets that are live and bounded
and have a home cluster, i.e., there is a cluster such that from any reachable
state there is a reachable state marking the places of this cluster. A home
cluster in a perpetual net serves as a ""regeneration point"" of the process,
e.g., to start a new process instance (case, job, cycle, etc.). Many
""well-behaved"" process models fall into this class. For example, the class of
short-circuited sound workflow nets is perpetual. Also, the class of processes
satisfying the conditions of the $\alpha$ algorithm for process discovery falls
into this category. This paper shows that the states in a perpetual marked
free-choice net are fully characterized by the transitions they enable, i.e.,
these process models are lucent. Having a one-to-one correspondence between the
actions that can happen and the state of the process, is valuable in a variety
of application domains. The full characterization of markings in terms of
enabled transitions makes perpetual free-choice nets interesting for workflow
analysis and process mining. In fact, we anticipate new verification, process
discovery, and conformance checking techniques for the subclasses identified.

believed to be accelerated either by CME shock or by magnetic reconnection. The
latter also produces solar flares, in which the white light flares (WLFs) are
among the most energetic ones. Magnetic reconnections occur in the corona and
the accelerated particles propagate both downward and upward along the magnetic
loops. The former is the source of flare emission and the latter is thought to
be SEPs. Therefore, a comparison between flare emission and SEP events provides
valuable constraint in determining the acceleration site of SEPs. We collect 43
SEP events, observed from 2010 to 2017, and investigate their correlation with
WL emission and SXR flus, observed by SDO/HMI and GOES, respectively. Our
preliminary results show: 1) Among 47 SEP events, 39 of which do not have
detectable flare emissions in white light and SXR. 2) Most strong WLFs are not
associated with SEPs. 3) No clear correlation is found between the proton flux
and the equivalent area, a quantity that measures the magnitude of WLF
emission. A straightforward speculation is that the acceleration process could
be different for SEPs and the energetic electrons powering WLFs in the events
analyzed.

  Classification and Reporting in Chest X-rays","v1: Main paper + supplementary material",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Chest X-rays are one of the most common radiological examinations in daily
clinical routines. Reporting thorax diseases using chest X-rays is often an
entry-level task for radiologist trainees. Yet, reading a chest X-ray image
remains a challenging job for learning-oriented machine intelligence, due to
(1) shortage of large-scale machine-learnable medical image datasets, and (2)
lack of techniques that can mimic the high-level reasoning of human
radiologists that requires years of knowledge accumulation and professional
training. In this paper, we show the clinical free-text radiological reports
can be utilized as a priori knowledge for tackling these two key problems. We
propose a novel Text-Image Embedding network (TieNet) for extracting the
distinctive image and text representations. Multi-level attention models are
integrated into an end-to-end trainable CNN-RNN architecture for highlighting
the meaningful text words and image regions. We first apply TieNet to classify
the chest X-rays by using both image features and text embeddings extracted
from associated reports. The proposed auto-annotation framework achieves high
accuracy (over 0.9 on average in AUCs) in assigning disease labels for our
hand-label evaluation dataset. Furthermore, we transform the TieNet into a
chest X-ray reporting system. It simulates the reporting process and can output
disease classification and a preliminary report together. The classification
results are significantly improved (6% increase on average in AUCs) compared to
the state-of-the-art baseline on an unseen and hand-labeled dataset (OpenI).

from traditional MHD turbulence mainly in two aspects, one being the existence
of many linearly stable small-scale modes which cause an effective damping

the scale dependent anisotropy frequently encountered in traditional weak
turbulence or critically balanced turbulence theory. These two differences

taking the form of a power law multiplied by an exponential falloff. Numerical
simulation is carried out using viscous resistive MHD equations to verify our

problem in statistical network analysis since the early work of Goodman
\cite{Goodman1949} and Frank \cite{Frank1978}. We revisit a problem formulated
by Frank \cite{Frank1978} of estimating the number of connected components in a
large graph based on the subgraph sampling model, in which we randomly sample a
subset of the vertices and observe the induced subgraph. The key question is
whether accurate estimation is achievable in the \emph{sublinear} regime where
only a vanishing fraction of the vertices are sampled. We show that it is
impossible if the parent graph is allowed to contain high-degree vertices or
long induced cycles. For the class of chordal graphs, where induced cycles of
length four or above are forbidden, we characterize the optimal sample
complexity within constant factors and construct linear-time estimators that
provably achieve these bounds. This significantly expands the scope of previous
results which have focused on unbiased estimators and special classes of graphs
such as forests or cliques.
  Both the construction and the analysis of the proposed methodology rely on
combinatorial properties of chordal graphs and identities of induced subgraph
counts. They, in turn, also play a key role in proving minimax lower bounds
based on construction of random instances of graphs with matching structures of
small subgraphs.

emergency maneuvers while avoiding other vehicles on the road. To accomplish
this, the sensor-failed vehicle must predict the future semantic behaviors of
other drivers, such as lane changes, as well as their future trajectories given
a recent window of past sensor observations. We address the first issue of
semantic behavior prediction in this paper, which is a precursor to trajectory
prediction, by introducing a framework that leverages the power of recurrent
neural networks (RNNs) and graphical models. Our goal is to predict the future
categorical driving intent, for lane changes, of neighboring vehicles up to
three seconds into the future given as little as a one-second window of past
LIDAR, GPS, inertial, and map data.

methodology of Structural Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to learn factor
functions and take advantage of both the high-level structure of graphical
models and the sequence modeling power of RNNs, which we expect to afford more
transparent modeling and activity than opaque, single RNN models. To
demonstrate our approach, we validate our model using authentic interstate
highway driving to predict the future lane change maneuvers of other vehicles
neighboring our autonomous vehicle. We find that our composite Structural RNN
outperforms baselines by as much as 12% in balanced accuracy metrics.

near-adiabatic limit where the system evolves slowly enough that most but not

of leaving the ground state oscillates in $\tau$ with a frequency determined by
the integral of the spectral gap along the trajectory of the Hamiltonian, so

limited to a few hundreds of femtoseconds, preventing the imaging of ultrafast
dynamics of matter on the scale of several tens of femtoseconds. Then, we

profile and density compression ratio of shock fronts associated with Coronal
Mass Ejections (CMEs) observed in white light coronagraph images. We
demonstrate the method with two examples of fast halo CMEs ($\sim$ 2000 km
s$^{-1}$) observed on 2011 March 7 and 2014 February 25. Our method uses the
ellipsoid model to derive the three-dimensional (3D) geometry and kinematics of
the fronts. The density profiles of the sheaths are modeled with
double-Gaussian functions with four free parameters and the electrons are
distributed within thin shells behind the front. The modeled densities are
integrated along the lines of sight to be compared with the observed brightness
in COR2-A, and a $\chi^2$ approach is used to obtain the optimal parameters for
the Gaussian profiles. The upstream densities are obtained from both the
inversion of the brightness in a pre-event image and an empirical model. Then
the density ratio and Alfv\'{e}nic Mach number are derived. We find that the
density compression peaks around the CME nose, and decreases at larger position
angles. The behavior is consistent with a driven shock at the nose and a
freely-propagating shock wave at the CME flanks. Interestingly, we find that
the supercritical region extends over a large area of the shock and last longer
(several tens of minutes) than past reports. It follows that CME shocks are
capable of accelerating energetic particles in the corona over extended spatial
and temporal scales and are likely responsible for the wide longitudinal
distribution of these particles in the inner heliosphere. Our results also
demonstrate the power of multi-viewpoint coronagraphic observations and forward

architecture, denoted the FeATure TransfEr Network (FATTEN), is proposed for
the modeling of feature trajectories induced by variations of object pose. This
architecture exploits a parametrization of the pose manifold in terms of pose
and appearance. This leads to a deep encoder/decoder network architecture,
where the encoder factors into an appearance and a pose predictor. Unlike
previous attempts at trajectory transfer, FATTEN can be efficiently trained
end-to-end, with no need to train separate feature transfer functions. This is
realized by supplying the decoder with information about a target pose and the
use of a multi-task loss that penalizes category- and pose-mismatches. In
result, FATTEN discourages discontinuous or non-smooth trajectories that fail
to capture the structure of the pose manifold, and generalizes well on object
recognition tasks involving large pose variation. Experimental results on the
artificial ModelNet database show that it can successfully learn to map source
features to target features of a desired pose, while preserving class identity.

transfer of energy from the photoexcited carriers to the spin degrees of
freedom is still elusive and not understood. Here, we address this problem by
combining spectroscopic ellipsometry, ultrafast broadband optical spectroscopy
and ab initio calculations. Upon photoexcitation, we observe the emergence of a
complex collective response, which is due to high-energy coherent optical
phonons coupled to the out-of-equilibrium charge density. This response
precedes the magnetic order melting and is interpreted as the fingerprint of
the formation of anti-Jahn Teller polarons. We propose that the charge
localization in a long-lived self-trapped state hinders the emission of magnons
and other spin-flip mechanisms, causing the energy transfer from the charge to
the spin system to be mediated by the reorganization of the lattice.

likelihood theory. It is often asserted, however, that profile likelihood is
not a 'true' likelihood. One implication is that likelihood theory lacks the
generality of e.g. Bayesian inference, wherein marginalization is the universal
tool for dealing with nuisance parameters. Here we argue that profile
likelihood has as much claim to being a true likelihood as a marginal
probability has to being a true probability distribution. The crucial point we
argue is that a likelihood function is naturally interpreted as a maxitive
possibility measure: given this, the associated theory of integration with
respect to maxitive measures delivers profile likelihood as the direct analogue
of marginal probability in additive measure theory. Thus, given a background
likelihood function, we argue that profiling over the likelihood function is as
natural (or as unnatural, as the case may be) as marginalizing over a
background probability measure. The connections to Bayesian inference can also
be further clarified with the introduction of a suitable logarithmic distance
function, in which case the present theory can be naturally described as
'Tropical Bayes' in the sense of tropical algebra.

during an M1.6 flare SOL2015-03-12T11:50. At the flare ribbons, the Mg II
2791.59 line shows quasi-periodic short-duration red-wing enhancement, which is
likely related to repetitive chromospheric condensation as a result of episodic
heating. On the contrary, the Si IV 1402.77 line reveals a persistent red-wing
asymmetry in both the impulsive and decay phases, suggesting that this line
responds to both cooling downflows and chromospheric condensation. The first
two episodes of red-wing enhancement occurred around 11:42 UT and 11:45 UT,
when two moving brightenings indicative of heating fronts crossed the IRIS
slit. The greatly enhanced red wings of the Si IV and Mg II lines at these
occasions are accompanied by an obvious increase in the line intensities and
the HXR flux, suggesting two episodes of energy injection into the lower
atmosphere in the form of nonthermal electrons. The Mg II k/h ratio has a small
value of ~1.2 at the ribbons and decreases to ~1.1 at these two occasions.
Correspondingly, the Fe XXI 1354 line reveals two episodes of chromospheric
evaporation, which is characterized as a smooth decrease of the blue shift from
~300 km/s to nearly zero within ~3 minutes. The Fe XXI 1354 line is entirely
blueshifted in the first episode, while appears to contain a nearly stationary
component and a blueshifted component in the second episode. More episodes of
blueshifted Fe XXI emission is found around the northern ribbon in the decay
phase, though no obvious response is detected in the Si IV and Mg II emission.
We have also examined the Fe XXI emission at the flare loop top and identified
a secondary component with a ~200 km/s red shift, which possibly results from
the downward moving reconnection outflow. Our analysis also suggests a
reference wavelength of 1354.0878 Angstrom for this Fe XXI line.

white-light flares (WLFs) occur in a flare-productive active region (NOAA

and magnetic transients (MTs). We use the full-disk continuum filtergrams and
line-of-sight magnetograms taken by SDO/HMI to identify WLFs and MTs,
respectively. Images taken by SDO/AIA are also used to show the morphology of
the flares in the upper atmosphere. We found at least 20 WLFs out of a total of
70 flares above C class (28.6%) in NOAA active region 11515 during its passage
across the solar disk. Each of these WLFs occurred in a small region, with a
short duration of about 5 minutes. The enhancement of white-light continuum
intensity is usually small, with an average enhancement of 8.1%. The 20 WLFs
observed were found along an unusual configuration of the magnetic field
characterized by a narrow ribbon of negative field. Furthermore, the WLFs were
found to be accompanied by MTs, with radical changes in magnetic field strength
(or even a sign reversal) observed during the flare. In contrast, there is no
obvious signature of MTs in those 50 flares without white-light enhancements.
Our results suggest that WLFs occur much more frequently than what was
previously thought, with most WLFs being fairly weak enhancements. This may
explain why WLFs are not frequently reported. Our observations also suggest
that MTs and WLFs are closely related and appear co-spatial and co-temporal,
when considering HMI data. A larger enhancement of WL emission is often
accompanied by a larger change of the line-of-sight component of the unsigned
magnetic field. Considering the close relationship between MTs and WLFs, many
previously reported flares with MTs may be WLFs.

By hijacking a vulnerable component in victim apps, an attack app can escalate
its privilege for operations originally prohibited. Many prior studies have
been performed to understand and mitigate this issue, but no defense is being
deployed in the wild, largely due to the deployment difficulties and
performance concerns. In this paper we present SCLib, a secure component
library that performs in-app mandatory access control on behalf of app
components. It does not require firmware modification or app repackaging as in
previous works. The library-based nature also makes SCLib more accessible to
app developers, and enables them produce secure components in the first place
over fragmented Android devices. As a proof of concept, we design six mandatory
policies and overcome unique implementation challenges to mitigate attacks
originated from both system weaknesses and common developer mistakes. Our
evaluation using ten high-profile open source apps shows that SCLib can protect
their 35 risky components with negligible code footprint (less than 0.3% stub
code) and nearly no slowdown to normal intra-app communications. The worst-case
performance overhead to stop attacks is about 5%.

transitions of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO , and C$^{18}$O, and the J=2-1 of

the peak of which is close to the temperature of the Galactic emission

plausible explanation for the apparent difficulty to map this abundant molecule
in emission. The opacities of OH were found to be small and peak around 0.01.
For gas at intermediate extinctions (A$\rm_V$ $\sim$ 0.05-2 mag), the detection
rate of OH with detection limit $N(\mathrm{OH})\simeq 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ is
approximately independent of $A\rm_V$. We conclude that OH is abundant in the
diffuse molecular gas and OH absorption is a good tracer of `dark molecular gas
(DMG)'. The measured fraction of DMG depends on assumed detection threshold of
the CO data set. The next generation of highly sensitive low frequency radio
telescopes, FAST and SKA, will make feasible the systematic inventory of
diffuse molecular gas, through decomposing in velocity the molecular (e.g. OH

with the relativistic ejecta, especially for some active galactic nuclei
(AGNs), gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and micro-quasars, although these objects are
largely different in their lifetimes, sizes and features. We compare the
apparent superluminal motions of GRBs with AGNs and different sub-classes of
AGNs (e.g., Radio galaxies, BL Lac objects, and Quasars). Particularly, we
focus on two low luminosity GRBs, namely 060218 and 170817A, that are
ultra-long and short bursts associated with supernova and gravitational wave,
respectively. The apparent transverse velocity ($\beta_{app}$) of Swift and
pre-Swift GRBs are tightly correlated with the Doppler factor $\delta$ as
$\beta_{app}\propto\delta^{0.5}$, while all AGNs distribute around the line of
$\beta_{app}= \delta$ behaving a weak correlation of $\beta_{app}$ with
$\delta$ . In contrast, $\beta_{app}$ is positively correlated with Lorenz
factor $\gamma$ or $\gamma^2(1+z)^{-1}$, not for GRBs but for AGNs.
$\beta_{app}$ and $1+z$ are independent for neither GRBs nor AGNs, but
apparently exhibit a positive correlation of $\beta_{app}$ with $1+z$ from AGNs
to GRBs, showing a cosmological effect of evolution with redshift. I also found
that GRB 170817A and GRB 060218 are outliers of the above correlations.
Superluminal properties of GRBs are significantly different from those of AGNs.
However, there are no obvious differences between radio galaxies, BL Lac
objects, and quasars in terms of their superluminal motion. In despite of
radiation mechanism, beaming effect and cosmological expanding would play the
same roles on the superluminal motion for AGNs and GRBs.

star formation rate (SFR) and the gas surface density has three distinct power
laws that may result from one model in which gas collapses at a fixed fraction
of the dynamical rate. The power law slope is 1 when the observed gas has a
characteristic density for detection, 1.5 for total gas when the thickness is
about constant as in the main disks of galaxies, and 2 for total gas when the
thickness is regulated by self-gravity and the velocity dispersion is about
constant, as in the outer parts of spirals, dwarf irregulars, and giant
molecular clouds. The observed scaling of the star formation efficiency (SFR
per unit CO) with the dense gas fraction (HCN/CO) is derived from the KS
relationship when one tracer (HCN) is on the linear part and the other (CO) is
on the 1.5 part. Observations of a threshold density or column density with a
constant SFR per unit gas mass above the threshold are proposed to be selection
effects, as are observations of star formation in only the dense parts of
clouds. The model allows a derivation of all three KS relations using the
probability distribution function of density with no thresholds for star
formation. Failed galaxies and systems with sub-KS SFRs are predicted to have
gas that is dominated by an equilibrium warm phase where the thermal Jeans
length exceeds the Toomre length. A squared relation is predicted for molecular
gas-dominated young galaxies.

of storage nodes, where it can download the stored data. The dealer wants to
securely convey a specific secret $s_j$ to user $j$ via storage nodes, for
$j=1,2,...,m$. More specifically, two secrecy conditions are considered in this
multi-user context. The weak secrecy condition is that each user does not get
any information about the individual secrets of other users, while the perfect
secrecy condition implies that a user does not get any information about the
collection of all other users' secrets. In this system, the dealer encodes
secrets into several secret shares and loads them into the storage nodes. Given
a certain number of storage nodes we find the maximum number of users that can
be served in such a system and construct schemes that achieve this with perfect
secrecy. Lower bounds on the minimum communication complexity and the storage
overhead are characterized given any $n$ and $m$. We construct distributed
secret sharing protocols, under certain conditions on the system parameters,
that attain the lower bound on the communication complexity while providing
perfect secrecy. Furthermore, we construct protocols, again under certain
conditions, that simultaneously attain the lower bounds on the communication
complexity and the storage overhead while providing weak secrecy, thereby
demonstrating schemes that are optimal in terms of both the parameters. It is
shown how to modify the proposed protocols in order to construct schemes with
balanced storage load and communication complexity.

themselves with large mass loss rate few years before the SNe. Based on the

significantly limits their applications in electronics. Conventional top-down
methods e.g. electrospinning usually result in aligned structure for linear
polymers thus satisfactory enhancement on thermal conductivity, but they are
deficient for epoxy resin polymerized by monomers and curing agent due to
completely different cross-linked network structure. Here, we proposed a
bottom-up strategy, namely parallel-linking method, to increase the intrinsic
thermal conductivity of bulk epoxy resin. Through equilibrium molecular
dynamics simulations, we reported on a high thermal conductivity value of
parallel-linked epoxy resin (PLER) as 0.80 Wm-1K-1, more than twofold higher
than that of amorphous structure. Furthermore, by applying uniaxial tensile
strains along the intra-chain direction, a further enhancement in thermal
conductivity was obtained, reaching 6.45 Wm-1K-1. Interestingly, we also
observed that the inter-chain thermal conductivities decrease with increasing
strain. The single chain of epoxy resin was also investigated and,
surprisingly, its thermal conductivity was boosted by 30 times through tensile
strain, as high as 33.8 Wm-1K-1. Our study may provide a new insight on the
design and fabrication of epoxy resins with high thermal conductivity.

the WSM, three-dimensional quantum anomalous Hall insulator (3D QAHI), and
normal insulator (NI) phases in the clean limit. Based on the calculation of
the localization length and the Hall conductivity, we present rich phase
diagrams due to the interplay of intra- and interorbital disorders. We find
that the WSM with well-separated Weyl nodes is stable to both weak intra- and
interorbital disorders. However, weak intraorbital disorder can gap out a WSM
close to the 3D QAHI phase in the clean phase diagram, forming a 3D QAHI, and
it can also drive a NI near the WSM phase to a WSM. By contrast, weak
interorbital disorder can cause a 3D QAHI-WSM transition for a 3D QAHI in
proximity to the WSM phase in the clean limit, and it can annihilate a WSM near
the NI phase, bringing about a WSM-NI transition. We observe a diffusive
anomalous Hall metal (DAHM) phase at moderate disorder strength. The DAHM
appears in a wide range of the phase diagram when the intraorbital disorder
dominates over the interorbital disorder, while the DAHM is found to exist in a
narrow region or be missing in the phase diagram when the interorbital disorder
dominates.

and information processing. In the present work, we propose theoretically that
a honeycomb-structured LC circuit with short-range textures in inductance can
generate a topological photonic state accompanied by inversion between p- and
d-orbital like EM modes carrying optic orbital angular momenta (OAM). We
realize experimentally the topological photonic state in planar microstrips, a
sandwich structure of bottom metallic substrate, middle dielectric film and top
metallic strips with hexagonal patterns in strip width, in microwave frequency.
Measuring accurately the amplitude and phase of EM fields, we demonstrate
explicitly that topological interfacial EM waves launched from a linearly
polarized dipole source propagate in opposite directions according to the sign
of OAM, with the relative weight of p- and d-orbital like EM modes tunable
precisely by sweeping the frequency in the topological band gap, which can
hardly be achieved in other photonic systems and condensed-matter systems.
Achieving the topological photonic state in a simple and easy fabricable

manipulating EM modes with rich internal degrees of freedom, which can be
exploited for various applications.

tackling ITSC problems with deep learning. An adaptive cost-sensitive learning

proposed strategy, classifiers could automatically assign misclassification
penalties to each class. In the experimental section, the proposed method was
utilized to modify five neural networks. They were evaluated on a large volume,
real-life and imbalanced time-series dataset with six metrics. Each single

Gessel obtained the generating function of the number of permutations on $[n]$

significant shift in the peak position of A$_{2g}$ phonon mode has been
observed using Raman spectroscopy, which indicates the change in the coupling
due to the structural distortion with Nb substitution. The core-level
photoemission study confirms that the Nb is present in 5+ valence state. Our
study reveals that the nonmagnetic Nb$^{5+}$ ($d^0$) substitution converts
Co$^{3+}$ ions to Co$^{2+}$ and stabilize both in the high-spin state. Our
results suggest that structural and spin-state transitions as well as the
difference in the ionic radii between Nb$^{5+}$ and Co$^{3+}$ are playing an
important role in tuning the physical properties.

to construct a weighted Tikhonov-like functional. The key element of this
functional is the presence of the so-called Carleman Weight Function (CWF).
This is the function which is involved in the Carleman estimate for the Laplace
operator. This functional is strictly convex on any appropriate ball in a
Hilbert space for an appropriate choice of the parameters of the CWF. Thus,
both the absence of local minima and convergence of minimizers to the exact
solution are guaranteed. Numerical tests demonstrate a good performance of the
resulting algorithm. Unlikeprevious the so-called tail functions globally

phase-ordering (choosing the order of applying optimizations). The compiler
optimization space continues to grow due to the advancement of applications,

Generic optimization passes in compilers cannot fully leverage newly introduced

machine learning for the compiler optimization field, particularly on the two
major problems of (1) selecting the best optimizations and (2) the

not always convergent. Furthermore, we discuss regularization strategies that
were recently proposed to stabilize GAN training. Our analysis shows that GAN
training with instance noise or zero-centered gradient penalties converges. On
the other hand, we show that Wasserstein-GANs and WGAN-GP with a finite number
of discriminator updates per generator update do not always converge to the
equilibrium point. We discuss these results, leading us to a new explanation
for the stability problems of GAN training. Based on our analysis, we extend
our convergence results to more general GANs and prove local convergence for
simplified gradient penalties even if the generator and data distribution lie

machine learning pipelines based on genetic programming (GP), is a novel
example of this kind of applications. Recently we have proposed a way to
introduce imputation methods as part of TPOT. While our approach was able to
deal with problems with missing data, it can produce a high number of
unfeasible pipelines. In this paper we propose a strongly-typed-GP based

we introduce is based on the redefinition of the operators and implicit

small filament eruption in NOAA active region 11476 on 2012 May 10. During this
flare, a circular flare ribbon appeared in the east and a remote brightening
occurred in the northwest of the active region. Multi-wavelength data are
employed to analyze the WLF, including white light (WL), ultraviolet, extreme
ultraviolet, hard X-ray (HXR) and microwave. A close spatial and temporal
relationship between the WL, HXR and microwave emissions is found in this WLF.
However, the peak time of the WL emission lagged that of the HXR and microwave
emissions by about 1-2 minutes. Such a result tends to support the back-warming
mechanism for the WL emission. Interestingly, the enhanced WL emission occurred
at the two footpoints of the filament. Through forced and potential field
extrapolations, we find that the three-dimensional magnetic field in the flare
region has a fan-spine feature and that a flux rope lies under the dome-like
field structure. We describe the entire process of flare evolution into several
steps, each producing the sequent brightening below the filament, the circular
flare ribbons and the WL enhancement respectively. We suggest that reconnection
between the magnetic field of the filament and the overlying magnetic field or
reconnection within the flux rope leads to the WL enhancement.

appropriate value can be found automatically in the sampling process, which

nuclear pairing and shell effects are added to the input layer in addition to
the proton and mass numbers. As a result, the theoretical accuracies are
significantly improved not only for nuclear masses but also for single-nucleon

the distortion of the embedding, and for an $n$-dimensional vector $y$,
$\|y\|_p$ is the $\ell_p$-norm. Another important property is the sparsity of
$\Pi$, that is, the maximum number of non-zero entries per column, as this
determines the running time of computing $\Pi \cdot A$. While for $p = 2$ there
are nearly optimal tradeoffs in terms of the dimension, distortion, and
sparisty, for the important case of $1 \leq p < 2$, much less was known. In
this paper we obtain nearly optimal tradeoffs for $\ell_p$ oblivious subspace

factors. We also give sparse oblivious subspace embeddings for every $1 \leq p

removal of the stored data. In large scale networks like the Internet of Things
(IoT), however, this feature significantly increases BC storage size and raises
privacy challenges. In this paper, we propose a Memory Optimized and Flexible
BC (MOF-BC) that enables the IoT users and service providers to remove or
summarize their transactions and age their data and to exercise the ""right to
be forgotten"". To increase privacy, a user may employ multiple keys for
different transactions. To allow for the removal of stored transactions, all
keys would need to be stored which complicates key management and storage.
MOF-BC introduces the notion of a Generator Verifier (GV) which is a signed
hash of a Generator Verifier Secret (GVS). The GV changes for each transaction
to provide privacy yet is signed by a unique key, thus minimizing the
information that needs to be stored. A flexible transaction fee model and a
reward mechanism is proposed to incentivize users to participate in optimizing
memory consumption. Qualitative security and privacy analysis demonstrates that
MOF-BC is resilient against several security attacks. Evaluation results show
that MOF-BC decreases BC memory consumption by up to 25\% and the user cost by
more than two orders of magnitude compared to conventional BC instantiations.

the presence of an external eavesdropper. In this problem, an eavesdropper
receives a signal with a lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to the
legitimate receiver and all transmitted messages should be kept confidential
against the eavesdropper. For this purpose, we propose a secure coding scheme
on this channel which utilizes low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes by
employing random bit insertion and puncturing techniques. At each encoder, the
confidential message with some random bits as a random message are
systematically encoded, and then the associated bits to the confidential
message are punctured. Next, the encoders send their unpunctured bits over a
Gaussian multiple access wiretap channel (GMAC-WT). The puncturing distribution
applied to the LDPC code is considered in two cases: random and optimized. We
utilize a modified extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart analysis to
optimize the puncturing distribution for each encoder. The security gap is used
as a measure of secrecy for the sent messages over GMAC-WT which should be made
as small as possible. We compare the achieved secure rate pair with an
achievable secrecy rate region of GMAC-WT to show the effective performance of
the proposed scheme. In this paper, equal and unequal power conditions at the
transmitters are investigated. For both cases, we attain a fairly small
security gap which is equivalent to achieve the points near the secrecy rate
region of GMAC-WT.

We prove that FeB$_4$ is particularly prone to ferromagnetic spin fluctuations
due to the presence of iron, resulting in a large Stoner interaction strength,
$I=1.5$ eV, as calculated from first principles. The other important factor is
its Fermi surface that consists of three separate sheets, among which two
nested ellipsoids. The resulting susceptibility has a ferromagnetic peak around
$\textbf{q}=0$, from which we calculated the repulsive interaction between
Cooper pair electrons using the random phase approximation. Subsequently, we
combined the electron-phonon interaction calculated from first principles with
the spin fluctuation interaction in fully anisotropic Eliashberg theory
calculations. We show that the resulting superconducting gap spectrum is
conventional, yet very strongly depleted due to coupling to the spin
fluctuations. The critical temperature decreases from $T_{\mathrm{c}}= 41$ K,
if they are not taken into account, to $T_{\mathrm{c}}= 1.7$ K, in good
agreement with the experimental value.

future 5G and beyond cellular systems is crucial for developing efficient

non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA). In this paper, we derive an explicit
rigorous closed-form analytical expression for the optimum spectral efficiency
in the large-system limit of regular sparse NOMA, where only a fixed and finite
number of orthogonal resources are allocated to any designated user, and vice
versa. The basic Verd\'u-Shamai formula for (dense) randomly-spread
code-division multiple-access (RS-CDMA) turns out to coincide with the limit of
the derived expression, when the number of orthogonal resources per user grows
large. Furthermore, regular sparse NOMA is rigorously shown to be spectrally
more efficient than RS-CDMA across the entire system load range. It may
therefore serve as an efficient means for reducing the throughput gap to
orthogonal transmission in the underloaded regime, and to the ultimate
Cover-Wyner bound in overloaded systems. The results analytically reinforce
preliminary conclusions in [1], which mostly relied on heuristics and numerical
observations. The spectral efficiency is also derived in closed form for the
suboptimal linear minimum-mean-square-error (LMMSE) receiver, which again
extends the corresponding Verd\'u-Shamai LMMSE formula to regular sparse NOMA.

anharmonicity is associated with the soft transverse optical (TO) phonon modes
and arises from the long-range interactions driven by the orbital governed
resonant bonding. Our study highlights the physical origin of the phonon
anharmonicity in phosphorene, and also provides new insights into phonon

SFR(global)-M*(global) relation, is crucial for understanding star formation
history and evolution of galaxies. However, many studies have dealt with SFR
using unresolved measurements, which makes it difficult to separate out the
contamination from other ionizing sources, such as active galactic nuclei and
evolved stars. Using the integral field spectroscopic observations from SDSS-IV
MaNGA, we spatially disentangle the contribution from different H{\alpha}
powering sources for ~1000 galaxies. We find that, when including regions
dominated by all ionizing sources in galaxies, the spatially-resolved relation
between H{\alpha} surface density ({\Sigma}H{\alpha}(all)) and stellar mass
surface density ({\Sigma}*(all)) progressively turns over at high
{\Sigma}*(all) end for increasing M*(global) and bulge dominance
(bulge-to-total light ratio, B/T). This in turn leads to the flattening of the
integrated H{\alpha}(global)-M*(global) relation in the literature. By
contrast, there is no noticeable flattening in both integrated
H{\alpha}(HII)-M*(HII) and spatially-resolved
{\Sigma}H{\alpha}(HII)-{\Sigma}*(HII) relations when only regions where star
formation dominates the ionization are considered. In other words, the
flattening can be attributed to the increasing regions powered by
non-star-formation sources, which generally have lower ionizing ability than
star formation. Analysis of the fractional contribution of non-star-formation
sources to total H{\alpha} luminosity of a galaxy suggests a decreasing role of
star formation as an ionizing source toward high-mass, high-B/T galaxies and
bulge regions. This result indicates that the appearance of the galaxy
integrated SFR-M* relation critically depends on their global properties
(M*(global) and B/T) and relative abundances of various ionizing sources within
the galaxies.

that all split forms satisfy the mixed Tate property, while exhibiting
non-split forms that do not. Finally, we prove that for any affine group scheme

the massive celestial body at a distance of 250-400 AU from the Sun as well as
the factor of comets transfer. It is shown, that the conjecture of the point
around which cometary perihelia might be concentrated, is not consistent. On
the issue of perihelia distribution, priority should be given to the assumption
that there is a plane or planes around which the concentration takes place. A
total of 24 comet groups were investigated. In almost all cases there are
detected two types of planes or zones: the first one is very close to the
ecliptic, another one is about perpendicular to it and has the parameters: ip =
86{\deg}, {\Omega}p = 271.7{\deg}. The existence of the first area appears to
be related to the influence of giant planets. The Guliyev's hypothesis says
that there is a massive perturber in the second zone, at a distance of 250-400
AU. It shows that number of aphelia and distant nodes of cometary orbits in
this interval significantly exceeds the expected background. Analysis of the
angular parameters of the comets, calculated relative to the second plane
(reference point is the ascending node of a large circle) displays clear
patterns: shortage of comets near i' = 180{\deg}, excess of them near B'=
0{\deg} (ecliptic latitude of perihelion) and shortage near B'=-90{\deg}. The
analysis also shows irregularity of distant nodes, overpopulation of perihelion
longitudes in the range 350{\deg}-20{\deg}. Plotted distributions of aphelia
N(Q) and distant cometary nodes clearly indicate a perturbation of the natural
course near 300 AU. On the basis of collected cometary data, we have estimated

using any boundary conditions (or free boundary condition) by the help of
applying successively block-spin transformation. Exact relation are obtained
between spin-spin correlation functions in the absence of external field. To
evaluate average magnetization (or the order parameter), it is assumed that the
average magnetization can be related to infinitely apart two spin correlation
function as $<\sigma>^{2}=<\sigma_{0}\sigma_{N}>$. A discussion to justify this
consideration is given in the introduction with a relevant manner. It is
obtained that $<\sigma_{0}\sigma_{1}>=\tanh{K}$, which is exactly the same
relation as the previously derived relation by considering the configurational
space equivalence of $\{\sigma_{i}\sigma_{i+1}\}=\{s_{i}\}$ and the result of
transfer matrix method in the absence of external field. By applying further
block-spin transformation, it is obtained that
$\{\sigma_{0}\sigma_{j}\}=(\tanh{K})^{j}$, here $j$ assumes the values of
$j=2^n$, here $n$ is an integer numbers. We believe that this result is really
important in that it is the only exact unique treatment of the 1D Ising chain
beside with the transfer matrix method. It is also pointed out the irrelevances
of some of the alternative derivation appearing in graduate level text books.
The obtained unique correlation relation in this this study leads in the limit
of $N\rightarrow\infty$ to $<\sigma_{i}>=(\tanh{K})^{N/2}$, indicating that the
second order phase transition is only possible in the limit of
$K\rightarrow\infty$. The obtained results in this work are exactly the same as
those of obtained by the transfer matrix method which considers periodic
boundary condition.

approximation using the chiral potential NNLO$_{\text{sat}}$. This potential
includes two- and three-body terms that has been simultaneously optimized to
low-energy nucleon-nucleon scattering data and selected nuclear structure data.
Our main foci have been the isoscalar monopole, isovector dipole, and isoscalar
quadrupole resonances of the closed-shell nuclei, $^4$He, $^{16,22,24}$O, and
$^{40,48}$Ca. These resonance modes have been widely observed in experiment. In
addition, we use a renormalized chiral potential $V_{\text{low-}k}$, based on
the N$^3$LO two-body potential by Entem and Machleidt [Phys. Rev. \textbf{C68},
041001 (2011)]. This introduces a dependency on the cutoff parameter used in
the normalization procedure as reported in previous works by other groups.
While NNLO$_{\text{sat}}$ can reasonably reproduce observed multipole
resonances, it is not possible to find a single cutoff parameter for the
$V_{\text{low-}k}$ potential that simultaneously describe the different types
of resonance modes. The sensitivity to the cutoff parameter can be explained by
missing induced three-body forces in the calculations. Our results for
neutron-rich $^{22,24}$O show a mixing nature of isoscalar and isovector
resonances in the dipole channel at low energies. We predict that $^{22}$O and
$^{24}$O have low-energy isoscalar quadrupole resonances at energies lower than

emerge, and the $\beta$-phase AsP monolayer has been recently proposed to be
thermodynamically stable from first-principles calculations. The studies of
thermal transport are very useful for these 2D materials-based nano-electronics
devices. Motivated by this, a comparative study of strain-dependent phonon
transport of AsP monolayer is performed by solving the linearized phonon
Boltzmann equation within the single-mode relaxation time approximation (RTA).
It is found that the lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_L$) of AsP monolayer
is very close to one of As monolayer with similar buckled structure, which is
due to neutralization between the reduce of phonon lifetimes and group velocity
enhancement from As to AsP monolayer. The corresponding room-temperature sheet
thermal conductance of AsP monolayer is 152.5 $\mathrm{W K^{-1}}$. It is noted
that the increasing tensile strain can harden long wavelength out-of-plane (ZA)
acoustic mode, and soften the in-plane longitudinal acoustic (LA) and
transversal acoustic (TA) modes. Calculated results show that $\kappa_L$ of AsP
monolayer presents a nonmonotonic up-and-down behavior with increased strain.
The unusual strain dependence is due to the competition among reduce of phonon
group velocities, improved phonon lifetimes of ZA mode and nonmonotonic
up-and-down phonon lifetimes of TA/LA mode. It is found that acoustic branches
dominate the $\kappa_L$ in considered strain range, and the contribution from
ZA branch increases with increased strain, while it is opposite for TA/LA
branch. By analyzing cumulative $\kappa_L$ with respect to phonon mean free
path (MFP), tensile strain can modulate effectively size effects on $\kappa_L$
in AsP monolayer.

high risk of rupture. An aneurysmal rupture could cause permanent disability
and even death. Finding and treating aneurysms before their rupture is very
difficult since symptoms can be easily attributed mistakenly to other common
brain diseases. Mathematical models could highlight possible mechanisms of
aneurismal development and suggest specialized biomarkers for aneurysms.
Existing mathematical models of intracranial aneurysms focus on mechanical
interactions between blood flow and arteries. However, these models cannot
apply to microaneurysms since the anatomy and physiology at the length scale of
cerebral microcirculation are different. In this paper we propose a mechanism
for the formation of microaneurysms that involves the chemo-mechanical coupling
of blood and endothelial and neuroglial cells. We model the blood as a
non-local non-Newtonian incompressible fluid and solve analytically the
Poiseuille flow of such a fluid through an axi-symmetric circular rigid and
impermeable pipe in the presence of wall slip. The spatial derivatives of the
proposed generalization of the rate of deformation tensor are expressed using
Caputo fractional derivatives. The wall slip is represented by the classic
Navier law and a generalization of this law involving fractional derivatives.
Numerical simulations suggest that hypertension could contribute to
microaneurysmal formation.

the relationship between the criticality of GRNs and system properties at a
higher level has remained unexplored. Here we aim at revealing a potential role
of criticality of GRNs at a multicellular level which are hard to uncover
through the single-cell-level studies, especially from an evolutionary
viewpoint. Our model simulated the growth of a cell population from a single
seed cell. All the cells were assumed to have identical GRNs. We induced
genetic perturbations to the GRN of the seed cell by adding, deleting, or
switching a regulatory link between a pair of genes. From numerical
simulations, we found that the criticality of GRNs facilitated the formation of
nontrivial morphologies when the GRNs were critical in the presence of the
evolutionary perturbations. Moreover, the criticality of GRNs produced
topologically homogenous cell clusters by adjusting the spatial arrangements of
cells, which led to the formation of nontrivial morphogenetic patterns. Our
findings corresponded to an epigenetic viewpoint that heterogeneous and complex
features emerge from homogeneous and less complex components through the
interactions among them. Thus, our results imply that highly structured tissues

undergoing anti-plane constrained shear. The asymptotically exact energy
density of crystals containing a moderately large density of excess
dislocations is found by the averaging procedure. This energy density is
extrapolated to the cases of extremely small or large dislocation densities. By
incorporating the configurational temperature and the density of redundant
dislocations, we develop the thermodynamic dislocation theory for non-uniform
plastic deformations and use it to predict the stress-strain curves and the
dislocation densities.

many applied problems where finding local solutions is insufficient. One of the
desirable properties of global optimization methods is \emph{strong
homogeneity} meaning that a method produces the same sequences of points where
the objective function is evaluated independently both of multiplication of the
function by a scaling constant and of adding a shifting constant. In this
paper, several aspects of global optimization using strongly homogeneous
methods are considered. First, it is shown that even if a method possesses this
property theoretically, numerically very small and large scaling constants can
lead to ill-conditioning of the scaled problem. Second, a new class of global
optimization problems where the objective function can have not only finite but
also infinite or infinitesimal Lipschitz constants is introduced. Third, the
strong homogeneity of several Lipschitz global optimization algorithms is
studied in the framework of the Infinity Computing paradigm allowing one to
work \emph{numerically} with a variety of infinities and infinitesimals.
Fourth, it is proved that a class of efficient univariate methods enjoys this
property for finite, infinite and infinitesimal scaling and shifting constants.
Finally, it is shown that in certain cases the usage of numerical infinities
and infinitesimals can avoid ill-conditioning produced by scaling. Numerical
experiments illustrating theoretical results are described.

(EE) of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-based cognitive radio
systems under channel uncertainties. We formulate an optimization problem that
guarantees a minimum required rate and a specified power budget for the
secondary user (SU), while restricting the interference to primary users (PUs)
in a statistical manner. The optimization problem is non-convex and it is
transformed to an equivalent problem using the concept of fractional
programming. Unlike all related works in the literature, we consider the effect
of imperfect channel-stateinformation (CSI) on the links between the SU
transmitter and receiver pairs and we additionally consider the effect of
limited sensing capabilities of the SU. Since the interference constraints are
met statistically, the SU transmitter does not require perfect CSI feedback
from the PUs receivers. Simulation results sho w that the EE deteriorates as
the channel estimation error increases. Comparisons with relevant works from
the literature show that the interference thresholds at the PUs receivers can
be severely exceeded and the EE is slightly deteriorated if the SU does no t
account for spectrum sensing errors.

wave backscattering from a single receiver/source? Here, in a two dimensional
setting, we show using a machine learning approach that both the particle
radius and concentration can be accurately measured when the boundary condition
on the particles is of Dirichlet type. Although the methods we introduce could
be applied to any particle type. In general backscattering is challenging to
interpret for a wide range of particle concentrations, because multiple
scattering cannot be ignored, except in the very dilute range. Across the
concentration range from 1% to 20% we find that the mean backscattered wave
field is sufficient to accurately determine the concentration of particles.
However, to accurately determine the particle radius, the second moment, or
average intensity, of the backscattering is necessary. We are also able to
determine what is the ideal frequency range to measure a broad range of
particles sizes. To get rigorous results with supervised machine learning
requires a large, highly precise, dataset of backscattered waves from an
infinite half-space filled with particles. We are able to create this dataset
by introducing a numerical approach which accurately approximates the
backscattering from an infinite half-space.

isotropic and nematic phases of liquid crystals (LCs). In the isotropic phase,
the electric field induces birefringence with an optical axis along the field.
The phenomenon is known as the Kerr effect. In the nematic, the analog of the
Kerr effect is the change of existing birefringence through nanosecond electric
modification of order parameters (NEMOP) that does not require realignment of
the optic axis. The utility of both effects for practical applications is
challenged by a relatively weak birefringence induced by the field. We address
the issue by adding a non-mesogenic additive 2, 3-dicyano-4-pentyloxyphenyl
4'-pentyloxybenzoate (DPP) with a large transverse dipole moment to mesogenic
materials in order to enhance their negative dielectric anisotropy. The DPP
doping substantially increases the field-induced birefringence in both NEMOP
and Kerr effects, up to 0.02. The doping also slows down the switching
processes, but this effect can be compensated by rising working temperatures,
if necessary. The enhancement of field induced birefringence by the
non-mesogenic dopant paves the way for practical applications of nanosecond
electro-optic effects.

generalizes the concept of EDP-convergence, which was introduced in
arXiv:1507.06322, and is called ""relaxed EDP-convergence"". Both notions are
based on De Giorgi's energy-dissipation principle, however the special

investigating the kinetic relation directly and using general forcings we still

formulated for multicarrier communication systems. The proposed algorithm
jointly maximizes the throughput and minimizes the transmit power through a

error rate (BER) per subcarrier and on the total transmit power. The
optimization problem is solved by the Lagrangian multiplier method if the
initial $\alpha$ causes the transmit power not to violate the power constraint;
otherwise, a bisection search is used to find the appropriate $\alpha$.
Closed-form expressions are derived for the close-to-optimal bit and power
allocations per subcarrier, average throughput, and average transmit power.
Simulation results illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm and
demonstrate its superiority with respect to existing allocation algorithms.
Furthermore, the results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm
approaches that of the exhaustive search for the discrete optimal allocations.
