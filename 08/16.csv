are considered. It is established that in the large-$N_c$ limit ($N_c$ is the

chiral symmetry breaking phase and the charged pion condensation one. The
primary conclusion of this investigation is the fact that chiral isospin
chemical potential generates charged pion condensation with non-zero baryon
density in dense quark matter. Moreover, it is shown that inhomogeneous charged
PC phase with nonzero baryon density is induced in the model by arbitrary small
values of the chemical potential $\mu_{I5}$ (for a rather large region of

domain of session-based next item recommendation. An ordered collection of past
items the user has interacted with in a session (or sequence) are embedded into
a 2-dimensional latent matrix, and treated as an image. The convolution and
pooling operations are then applied to the mapped item embeddings. In this
paper, we first examine the typical session-based CNN recommender and show that
both the generative model and network architecture are suboptimal when modeling
long-range dependencies in the item sequence. To address the issues, we
introduce a simple, but very effective generative model that is capable of
learning high-level representation from both short- and long-range item
dependencies. The network architecture of the proposed model is formed of a
stack of \emph{holed} convolutional layers, which can efficiently increase the
receptive fields without relying on the pooling operation. Another contribution
is the effective use of residual block structure in recommender systems, which
can ease the optimization for much deeper networks. The proposed generative
model attains state-of-the-art accuracy with less training time in the next
item recommendation task. It accordingly can be used as a powerful
recommendation baseline to beat in future, especially when there are long
sequences of user feedback.

collection in spatiotemporally varying marine environments. However, these
vehicles need to estimate their positions (states) with intrinsic sensing in
their long-term trajectories. In previous studies, autonomous underwater
vehicles have commonly used vision and range sensors for autonomous state
estimation. Inspired by the intrinsic sensing and the persistent deployment, we
investigate the localization problem (state estimation) for an inexpensive and
underactuated drifting vehicle called a drifter. In this paper, we present a
localization method for the drifter making use of the observations of a
proprioceptive sensor, i.e., compass. We create the water flow pattern within a
given region from ocean model predictions, develop a stochastic motion model,
and analyze the persistent water flow behavior. Given a distribution of initial
deployment states of the drifter at a particular depth of the water column
within the region and the water flow pattern, our method finds attractors and
their transient groups at the given depth as the persistent behavior of the
water flow. A most-likely localized trajectory of the drifter for a sequence of
compass observations is generated based on the persistent behavior of the water
flow and hidden Markov model. Our simulation results based on data from ocean
model predictions substantiate good performance of our proposed localization
method with a low error rate of the state estimation in the long-term
trajectory of the drifter.

spectroscopy is to study in a systematic way the change in the photoelectron
yield as a function of the relative phase between the strong fundamental field
component (of carrier frequency $\omega$) and a weak, second color component
(e.g., $2\omega$). The observable of interest is the
photoelectron-momentum-dependent phase of the change in the electron yield with
respect to the relative phase, hence the name ""phase of the phase."" In the
present paper, phase-of-the-phase spectroscopy is extended to circularly
polarized light. With a small, counter-rotating $2\omega$-component,
photoelectron spectra have a three-fold symmetry in the polarization plane. The
same is true for the corresponding phase-of-the-phase spectra. However, a
peculiar, very sharp phase-flip by $\pi$ occurs at a certain radial momentum of
the photoelectron that is sensitive to both laser parameters and the ionization
potential. Results from the numerical solution of the time-dependent
Schr\""odinger equation are compared to those from the strong-field

present results of fluctuating LB simulations of a binary mixture confined
between two parallel walls in presence of a constant concentration gradient in
the wall-to-wall direction. This is a paradigmatic set-up for the study of
non-equilibrium (NE) fluctuations, i.e. fluctuations with respect to a non-
equilibrium state. We analyze the dependence of the structure factors for the
hydrodynamical fields on the wave vector $\boldsymbol{q}$ in both the
directions parallel and perpendicular to the walls, as well as the finite-size
effects induced by confinement, highlighting the long-range ($\sim
|\boldsymbol{q}|^{-4}$) nature of correlations in the NE framework. Results
quantitatively agree with the predictions of fluctuating hydrodynamics.
Moreover, in presence of a non-ideal (NI) equation of state of the mixture, we
also observe that the (spatially homogeneous) average pressure changes, due to
a genuinely new contribution triggered by the long-range nature of NE
fluctuations. These NE pressure effects are studied at changing the system size
and the concentration gradient. Taken all together, we argue that these
findings are instrumental to boost the applicability of the fluctuating LB
methodology in the framework of NE fluctuations, possibly in conjunction with

pitch-angle distribution of the electrons is assumed to be isotropic. However,
if electrons are accelerated anisotropically, e.g, in a relativistic shock wave
with an ordered magnetic field or in magnetic reconnection regions, the
electron pitch angles might be anisotropic. In this work, we study synchrotron
radiation from electrons with a pitch-angle distribution with respect to a
large-scale uniform magnetic field. Assuming that the pitch-angle distribution
is normal with a scatter of $\sigma_p$ and that the viewing direction is where
the pitch-angle direction peaks, we find that for electrons with a Lorentz
factor $\gamma$, the observed flux satisfies $F_\nu\propto\nu^{2/3}$ for
$\nu\ll\nu_{\rm cr}$ ($\nu_{\rm cr}$ is the critical frequency of synchrotron),
if $\sigma_p\lesssim1/\gamma$ is satisfied. On the other hand, if
$\sigma_p\gg1/\gamma$, the spectrum below $\nu_{\rm cr}$ is a broken power law
with a break frequency $\nu_{\rm br}\sim2\nu_{\rm cr}/\sigma_p^3\gamma^3$,
e.g., $F_\nu\propto\nu^{2/3}$ for $\nu\ll\nu_{\rm br}$ and
$F_\nu\propto\nu^{1/3}$ for $\nu_{\rm br}\ll\nu\ll\nu_{\rm cr}$. Thus the

demonstrate here that backside tungsten coating of copper foil allows the

related to the absence of decomposition of methane on the backside and
consequently to the suppression of C diffusion through copper. In the
perspective of large-scale production of graphene, this approach constitutes a
significant improvement to the traditional CVD growth process since (1) a tight

description of the medium in the presence of magnetic field. This could be done
by obtaining the one-loop self energy of photon due to the effective (quasi-)
quark loop at finite temperature under an arbitrary external magnetic field
while employing the real time formalism of Thermal Field Theory. The effective
quarks and gluons encode hot QCD medium effective in terms of their respective
effective fugacities. The magnetic field enters in the form of landau level
quantization, in the matter sector (quarks, antiquarks). The full Schwinger
proper time propagator including all the Landau levels is considered for the
quasi quarks while calculating the photon self energy. The electromagnetic
Debye screening (in terms of the self-energy) has seen to be influenced both by
the hot QCD medium effects and magnetic field. Analogous results are also
obtained from the semi classical transport theory. The imaginary part of the
photon self energy function is obtained from the discontinuities of the self
energy across the Unitary cuts which are also present at zero magnetic field
and the Landau cuts which are purely due to the magnetic field. The dilepton
production rate is then obtained in terms of the product of electromagnetic
spectral functions due to quark loop and lepton loop. The modifications of both
the quarks/antiquarks as well as leptons in presence of an arbitrary external
magnetic field have been considered in the formalism. Significant enhancement
of the low invariant mass dileptons due the appearance of the Landau cuts in
the electromagnetic spectral function at finite external magnetic field has
been observed. A substantial enhancement of dilepton rate is also found when
the EOS effects are considered through the effective quarks/antiquraks.

problem, for which proximal operators have been proposed recently. The phase
retrieval problem commonly refers to the task of recovering a target signal
based on the magnitude of linear projections of that signal onto known vectors,
usually under the presence of noise. A more general problem is the
multispectral phase retrieval problem, where sums of these magnitudes are
observed instead. In this paper we study the proximal operator for this
problem, which appears in applications like X-ray solution scattering. We show
that despite its non-convexity, all local minimizers are global minimizers,
guaranteeing the optimality of simple descent techniques. An efficient linear
time exact Newton method is proposed based on the structure of the problem's
Hessian. Initialization criteria are discussed and the computational
performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to that of traditional
descent methods. The studied proximal operator can be used in a distributed and
parallel scenarios using an ADMM scheme and allows for exploiting the spectral
characteristics of the problem's measurement matrices, known in many physical
sensing applications, in a way that is not possible with non-splitted

explains how their populations influenced by oxidation, reduction, irradiation
and doping can enhance diffusion. However, we have found the same influences
can also elevate their mobility by orders of magnitude in several prototypical

the latter observation to migrating ion's local structure, which is inherently
soft and has a broken symmetry, making it susceptible to electron or hole
localization, thereby realizing a lower saddle-point energy. This finding
resolves an unanswered question in physical ceramics of the past 30 years: why
cation diffusion against the prediction of classical nonstoichiometric defect
physics is enhanced in reduced zirconia, ceria and structurally related
ceramics? It also suggests the saddle-point electron-phonon interaction that
enables a negative-U state is akin to the counterweight effect that enables a
trebuchet. This simple picture for the transitional state explains why enhanced
kinetics mediated by radical-like-ion migration occurs often, especially under
extreme conditions.

cation diffusion in a reducing atmosphere in zirconia, ceria and barium
titanate are in support of an interstitial mechanism. Yet previous
computational studies always found a much higher formation energy for cation
interstitials than for cation vacancies, which would rule out the interstitial
mechanism. The conundrum has been resolved via first-principles calculations
comparing migration of reduced cations and oxidized ones, in cubic ZrO2, CeO2
and BaTiO3. In nearly all cases, reduction alone lowers the migration barrier,
and pronounced lowering results if cation's electrostatic energy at the saddle
point decreases. The latter is most effectively realized when a Ti cation is
allowed to migrate via an empty Ba site thus being fully screened all the way
by neighboring anions. Since reduction creates oxygen vacancies as well, which
are highly mobile, we also studied their effect on cation migration, and found
it only marginally lowers the migration barrier. In several cases, however, a
large synergistic effect between cation reduction and oxygen vacancy is
revealed, causing an electron to localize in the saddle-point state at a much
lower energy than normal, signaling that the saddle point is a negative-U state
in which the soft environment enables a large electron-phonon interaction that
can over-compensate the on-site Coulomb repulsion. These general findings are
expected to be applicable to defect-mediated ion migration in most transitional

classical Wiener space driven by a smoothened (Gaussian) space-time white
noise. For $d\geq 3$ it was shown in \cite{MSZ16} that for small noise
intensity, the total mass of the GMC converges to a strictly positive random
variable, while larger disorder strength (i.e., low temperature) forces the
total mass to lose uniform integrability, eventually producing a vanishing
limit. Inspired by strong localization phenomena for log-correlated Gaussian
fields and Gaussian multiplicative chaos in the finite dimensional Euclidean
spaces (\cite{MRV16,BL18}), and related results for discrete directed polymers
(\cite{V07,BC16}), we study the endpoint distribution of a Brownian path under
the {\it{renormalized}} GMC measure in this setting. We show that in the low
temperature regime, the energy landscape of the system freezes and enters the
so called {\it{glassy phase}} as the entire mass of the Ces\`aro average of the
endpoint GMC distribution stays localized in few spatial islands, forcing the
endpoint GMC to be {\it{asymptotically purely atomic}} (\cite{V07}). The method
of our proof is based on the translation-invariant compactification introduced
in \cite{MV14} and a fixed point approach related to the cavity method from
spin glasses recently used in \cite{BC16} in the context of the directed
polymer model in the lattice.

cluster states not only have wide application in quantum computing, but also
have the convenient property of having similar state preparation circuits and

the GHZ case that they actually oscillate, which we interpret as a drift in the
relative phase between the $|0\rangle^{\otimes n}$ and $|1\rangle^{\otimes n}$

experimentally correcting for this drift with virtual Z rotations we find that
the GHZ states appear to be considerably more robust than cluster states,
exhibiting higher fidelity and entanglement at later times. Our results

first learn the simpler shape and structural concepts before tackling the

index of $\Gamma\sim 2$, a column density of $N_{\mathrm{H}}\sim 5\times
10^{20}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$, and no prominent reflection component. Five years
later, Chandra captured the source in a heavily-obscured, reflection-dominated

Compton-thick cloud with $N_{\mathrm{H}}\sim 2\times 10^{24}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$
eclipsing the direct emission of the hot corona, implying an extreme
$N_{\mathrm{H}}$ variation never before observed in a type-1 QSO. An
alternative scenario is a corona that switched off in between the observations.
In addition, both explanations require a significant change of the X-ray
luminosity prior to the obscuration or fading of the corona and/or a change of
the relative geometry of the source/reflector system. Dramatic X-ray spectral
variability of this kind could be quite common in type-1 QSOs, considering the
relatively few datasets in which such an event could have been identified. Our
analysis implies that there may be a population of type-1 QSOs which are
Compton-thick in the X-rays when observed at any given time.

for the absorption and re-emission of stellar radiation by interstellar dust.
The predicted EBL is in near-perfect agreement with recent observations over
the whole UV-to-mm spectrum, as is the evolution of the cosmic spectral energy
distribution over the redshift range for which observations are available
($z\lesssim1$). We show that approximately 90~per~cent of the EBL is produced
at $z<2$ although this shifts to higher redshifts for sub-mm wavelengths. We
assess whether the top-heavy IMF in starbursts is necessary in order to
reproduce the EBL at the same time as other key observables, and find that
variant models with a universal solar-neighborhood IMF display poorer agreement
with EBL observations over the whole UV-to-mm spectrum and fail to match the

dynamics of this emergent phase, which has no single-particle analog and exists
only for strong disorder and finite interaction, is determined by the many-body
configuration of the initial state. Remarkably, this phase features the
$\textit{coexistence}$ of localized and extended many-body states at fixed
energy density and thus does not exhibit a many-body mobility edge, nor does it
reduce to a model with a single-particle mobility edge in the noninteracting
limit. We show that eigenstates in this phase can be described in terms of
interacting emergent Ising spin degrees of freedom (""singlons"") suspended in a
mixture with inert charge degrees of freedom (""doublons"" and ""holons""), and
thus dub it a $\textit{mobility emulsion}$ (ME). We argue that grouping
eigenstates by their doublon/holon density reveals a transition between
localized and extended states that is invisible as a function of energy
density. We further demonstrate that the dynamics of the system following a
quench may exhibit either thermalizing or localized behavior depending on the
doublon/holon density of the initial product state. Intriguingly, the
ergodicity of the ME is thus tuned by the initial state of the many-body

density is higher by a factor of 1.4 and therefore the standard error in
NIR-derived ellipticities is about 30% smaller, implying a more precise
ellipticity measurement. The good performance of the NIR is mainly because
galaxies have an intrinsically smoother light distribution in the NIR bands
than in the optical, the latter tracing the clumpy star-forming regions. In
addition, the NIR bands have a higher surface brightness per pixel than the
optical images, while being less affected by dust attenuation. Despite the
worse spatial sampling and resolution of Euclid NIR compared to optical, the
NIR approach yields equivalent or more precise galaxy ellipticity measurements.
If systematics that affect shape such as dithering strategy and point spread
function undersampling can be mitigated, inclusion of the NIR can improve
galaxy ellipticity measurements over all redshifts. This is particularly
important for upcoming weak lensing surveys, such as with Euclid and WFIRST.

In an idealised collisionless approximation, the region around the cluster core
evolves in a self-similar way prior to the core collapse. Thus, its radial
density profile outside the core can be described by a power law, $\rho \propto
r^{-\alpha}$. We aim to find the characteristics of core collapse in $N$-body
models. In such systems, a complete collapse is prevented by transferring the
binding energy of the cluster to binary stars. The contraction is, therefore,
more difficult to identify. We developed a method that identifies the core
collapse in $N$-body models of star clusters based on the assumption of their
homologous evolution. We analysed different models (equal- and multi-mass),
most of which exhibit patterns of homologous evolution, yet with significantly
different values of $\alpha$: the equal-mass models have $\alpha \approx 2.3$,
which agrees with theoretical expectations, the multi-mass models have $\alpha
\approx 1.5$ (yet with larger uncertainty). Furthermore, most models usually
show sequences of separated homologous collapses with similar properties.
Finally, we investigated a correlation between the time of core collapse and
the time of formation of the first hard binary star. The binding energy of such
a binary usually depends on the depth of the collapse in which it forms, for
example from $100\,kT$ to $10^4\,kT$ in the smallest equal-mass to the largest
multi-mass model, respectively. However, not all major hardenings of binaries
happened during the core collapse. In the multi-mass models, we see large
transfers of binding energy of $\sim 10^4\,kT$ to binaries that occur on the
crossing timescale and outside of the periods of the homologous collapses.

time. We evolve one-dimensional Lagrangian shells with radiative cooling of the
gas and heating due to feedback from the gas cooling and moving in toward the
center. A simple Bondi accretion model on to a central black hole is used to
include feedback heating. The setup captures some of the key characteristics of
spherically symmetric accretion onto the halos: formation of virial shocks
slightly outside $r_{200}$ and long-term thermal balance in the form of cooling
and heating cycles. The gas density outside our initial halos at $z=6$ is
constrained by requiring that the baryon fraction within the virial radius for
non-radiative evolution be equal to the universal value at almost all times.
The total mass in the cold phase (taken to be $\sim 10^4$ K) within $40$ kpc is
tracked as a function of the halo mass and redshift. We compare the evolution
of the cold gas mass to the observed stellar-mass versus halo mass relations,
following which, we can constrain the feedback energy required for different
halo masses and redshifts. We also compare and match the hot gas density and
temperature profiles for our most massive halo to those of clusters observed

for interactions, we show that the exciton binding energy is exponentially
small for weak interactions. This is due to effective two-dimensional character
in the space of particle-hole pairs that are available for bound state

three dimensions. Nevertheless, intermediate interaction strengths can lead to

variance decreases with luminosity. Comparing to this mean relation, the
normalized UV excess variance of Mrk 231 is smaller, however within the scatter
characterising the full population. The upper limit of the X-ray excess

DC voltages close to the pull-in voltage, experiments and numerical simulations
have reported `bottleneck' behaviour in which the transient dynamics slow down
considerably. This slowing down is highly sensitive to external forces, and so
has widespread potential for applications that use pull-in time as a sensing
mechanism, including high-resolution accelerometers and pressure sensors.
Previously, the bottleneck phenomenon has only been understood using lumped
mass-spring models that do not account for effects such as variable residual
stress and different boundary conditions. We extend these studies to
incorporate the beam geometry, developing an asymptotic method to analyse the
pull-in dynamics. We attribute bottleneck behaviour to critical slowing down
near the pull-in transition, and we obtain a simple expression for the pull-in
time in terms of the beam parameters and external damping coefficient. This
expression is found to agree well with previous experiments and numerical
simulations that incorporate more realistic models of squeeze film damping, and
so provides a useful design rule for sensing applications. We also consider the
accuracy of a single-mode approximation of the microbeam equations --- an
approach that is commonly used to make analytical progress, without systematic
investigation of its accuracy. By comparing to our bottleneck analysis, we
identify the factors that control the error of this approach, and we

and neck CT images in an end-to-end fashion, receiving whole-volume HaN CT
images as input and generating masks of all OARs of interest in one shot.
AnatomyNet is built upon the popular 3D U-net architecture, but extends it in
three important ways: 1) a new encoding scheme to allow auto-segmentation on
whole-volume CT images instead of local patches or subsets of slices, 2)
incorporating 3D squeeze-and-excitation residual blocks in encoding layers for
better feature representation, and 3) a new loss function combining Dice scores
and focal loss to facilitate the training of the neural model. These features
are designed to address two main challenges in deep-learning-based HaN
segmentation: a) segmenting small anatomies (i.e., optic chiasm and optic
nerves) occupying only a few slices, and b) training with inconsistent data
annotations with missing ground truth for some anatomical structures.
  Results: We collected 261 HaN CT images to train AnatomyNet, and used MICCAI
Head and Neck Auto Segmentation Challenge 2015 as a benchmark dataset to
evaluate the performance of AnatomyNet. The objective is to segment nine
anatomies: brain stem, chiasm, mandible, optic nerve left, optic nerve right,
parotid gland left, parotid gland right, submandibular gland left, and
submandibular gland right. Compared to previous state-of-the-art results from
the MICCAI 2015 competition, AnatomyNet increases Dice similarity coefficient
by 3.3% on average. AnatomyNet takes about 0.12 seconds to fully segment a head
and neck CT image of dimension 178 x 302 x 225, significantly faster than
previous methods. In addition, the model is able to process whole-volume CT
images and delineate all OARs in one pass, requiring little pre- or
post-processing.

mitigating the spread of biological diseases which do not confer immunity to
those who have been infected previously, with sexually transmitted infections
being a prominent example of such. Technically, this paper provides a novel
contribution in demonstrating that the particular combinatorial optimal control
problem used to design resource allocations has an objective function which is
submodular, and so can be solved in polynomial time despite its combinatorial

simulations, and provide some comments on directions for future work.

  Networks",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantized deep neural networks (QDNNs) are attractive due to their much lower
memory storage and faster inference speed than their regular full precision
counterparts. To maintain the same performance level especially at low
bit-widths, QDNNs must be retrained. Their training involves piecewise constant
activation functions and discrete weights, hence mathematical challenges arise.
We introduce the notion of coarse gradient and propose the blended coarse
gradient descent (BCGD) algorithm, for training fully quantized neural
networks. Coarse gradient is generally not a gradient of any function but an
artificial ascent direction. The weight update of BCGD goes by coarse gradient
correction of a weighted average of the full precision weights and their
quantization (the so-called blending), which yields sufficient descent in the
objective value and thus accelerates the training. Our experiments demonstrate
that this simple blending technique is very effective for quantization at
extremely low bit-width such as binarization. In full quantization of ResNet-18
for ImageNet classification task, BCGD gives 64.36\% top-1 accuracy with binary
weights across all layers and 4-bit adaptive activation. If the weights in the
first and last layers are kept in full precision, this number increases to
65.46\%. As theoretical justification, we show convergence analysis of coarse
gradient descent for a two-linear-layer neural network model with Gaussian
input data, and prove that the expected coarse gradient correlates positively
with the underlying true gradient.

flat bands near charge neutrality, when tuned to special magic angles. However,
different criteria for the magic angle such as the vanishing of Dirac speed,
minimal bandwidth or maximal band gap to higher bands typically give different
results. Here we study a modified continuum model for TBG which has an infinite
sequence of magic angles $\theta$ at which, we simultaneously find that (i) the
Dirac speed vanishes (ii) absolutely flat bands appear at neutrality and (iii)
bandgaps to the excited bands are maximized. When parameterized in terms of
$\alpha\sim 1/\theta, $ they recur with the simple periodicity of $\Delta
\alpha \simeq 3/2$, which, beyond the first magic angle, differs from earlier
calculations. Further, in this model we prove that the vanishing of the Dirac
velocity ensures the exact flatness of the band and show that the flat band
wave functions are related to doubly-periodic functions composed of ratios of
theta functions. Also, using perturbation theory up to $\alpha^8$ we capture
important features of the first magic angle $\theta\approx1.09^{\circ}$

Taylor micro-scale Reynolds number $Re_\lambda = 77.76$ for three Froude
numbers $Fr = \infty,~ 0.052,~ 0.006$. The Froude number $Fr$ is defined as the
ratio of the Kolmogorov scale of acceleration and the magnitude of
gravitational acceleration. Thus, $Fr = \infty$ corresponds to zero gravity,
and $Fr = 0.006$ to the highest magnitude of gravity among the three DNS cases.
For each $Fr$, particles of six Stokes numbers in the range $ 0.01 \le St_\eta
\le 0.2$ were tracked in the DNS, and particle clustering quantified both as a
function of separation and the spherical polar angle. %Here $St_\eta$~is the
ratio of %the particle viscous relaxation time to the Kolmogorov time scale. We
compared the DNS and theory values for the power-law exponent $\beta$
characterizing the dependence of clustering on separation. Reasonable agreement
is seen between the DNS $\beta$'s for the $Fr = 0.006$ case and the theoretical
predictions obtained using the second drift closure (referred to as DF2).
Further, in conformity with the DNS, theory shows that the clustering of
$St_\eta \ll 1$ particles is only weakly anisotropic.

We assume dark energy to be represented by a homogeneous scalar field $\phi$

constant potential and the particles of dark matter fluid undergoing velocity
diffusion in background medium of the $k-$essence scalar field $\phi$. This
results in a transfer of energy from the fluid of dark matter to that of dark
energy. This effect shows up as a source term in the continuity equation for

coefficient which is a measure of average energy transferred per unit time due
to diffusion. We use time evolutions of the scale factor of background FRW
spacetime, energy density and pressure of the dark fluid obtained from analysis
of Supernova Ia data to obtain bounds on the diffusion parameter. For a
constant potential in the $k$-essence Lagrangian, the temporal behaviour of a
homogeneous $k$-essence field $\phi$ is obtained for different values of the

$\phi(t/t_0) = \phi_0 + \varepsilon_1 (t/t_0 - 1) + \varepsilon_2 (t/t_0

Historically, the experimental realization of 2DELs in silicon inversion layers

effects, culminating in the discovery of the quantum Hall effect. In the
following years, high quality 2DELs were obtained in doped quantum wells made

of fundamental interest but also important towards demonstrating new concepts

traditional semiconductors, for instance in multilayer graphene, oxide
interfaces, dichalcogenide monolayers, and many more. The concepts discussed in
this review will be relevant also for these emerging systems.

solutions for helical twist angles at $|\varphi(t)| = \pi$, which prevents the
build-up of arbitrary large free energies and misalignment angles. The minimum
energy principle predicts that neighbored magnetic field lines are almost
parallel (with misalignment angles of $\Delta \mu \approx
1.6^\circ-1.8^\circ$), and do not reach a critical misalignment angle prone to
nanoflaring. Consequently, no nanoflares are expected in the divergence-free

channel away from Van Hove filling. The $d$-wave pairing instability further
has a twelve-fold degeneracy while the $f$-wave pairing instability has a

using spatially-variable PSFs to generate $JHK_{s}$ photometric catalogues for

  derivative for strong-nonlinear full waveform inversion","38 pages;13 figures",,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traditional seismic envelope inversion takes use of a nonlinear misfit
functional which relates the envelope of seismogram to the observed wavefield
records, and then derive the sensitivity kernel of envelope to velocity through
the use of waveform Frechet derivative by linearizing the nonlinear functional.
We know that the waveform Frechet derivative is based on the Born approximation
of wave scattering and can only work for the case of weak scattering.
Therefore, the traditional envelope inversion using waveform Frechet derivative
has severe limitation in the case of strong-scattering for large-scale,
strong-contrast inclusions. In this paper, we derive a new direct envelope
Frechet derivative (sensitivity operator) based on energy scattering physics
without using the chain rule of differentiation. This new envelope Frechet
derivative does not have the weak scattering assumption for the wavefield and
can be applied to the case of strong-nonlinear inversion involving salt
structures. We also extend the envelope data into multi-scale window-averaged
envelope (WAE), which contains much rich low-frequency components corresponding
to the long-wavelength velocity structure of the media. Then we develop a joint
inversion which combines the new multi-scale direct envelope inversion (MS-DEI)
with standard FWI to recover large-scale strong-contrast velocity structure of
complex models. Finally, we show some numerical examples of its successful
application to the inversion of a 1-D thick salt-layer model and the 2D
SEG/EAGE salt model.

evolution dependent on the surrounding large-scale environment. The model
considers three unobserved (hidden) discrete states of intensification and
associates each state with a probability distribution of intensity change. The
storm's transit from one state to another is described as a Markov chain. Both
the intensity change and state transit components of the model are dependent on
environmental variables including potential intensity, vertical wind shear,
relative humidity, and ocean feedback. This Markov environment-dependent
hurricane intensity model (MeHiM) is used to simulate the evolution of storm
intensity along the storm track over the ocean, and a simple decay model is
added to estimate the intensity change when the storm moves over land. Data for
the North Atlantic (NA) basin from 1979-2014 (555 storms) are used for model
development and evaluation. Probability distributions of 6-h and 24-h intensity
change, lifetime maximum intensity, and landfall intensity based on model
simulations and observations compare well. Although the MeHiM is still limited
in fully describing rapid intensification, it shows a significant improvement
over previous statistical models (e.g., linear, nonlinear, and finite mixture
models).

data is heavily dependent on the complexity of the beamformed imagery. Several
mechanisms can contribute to this, including unwanted vehicle dynamics, the
bathymetry of the scene, and the presence of natural and manmade clutter. To
understand the impact of the environmental complexity on image perception,
researchers have taken approaches rooted in information theory, or heuristics.
Despite these efforts, a quantitative measure for complexity has not been
related to the phenomenology from which it is derived.
  By using subject matter experts (SMEs) we derive a complexity metric for a
set of imagery which accounts for the underlying phenomenology. The goal of
this work is to develop an understanding of how several common information
theoretic and heuristic measures are related to the SME perceived complexity in
synthetic aperture sonar imagery. To achieve this, an ensemble of 10-meter x
10-meter images were cropped from a high-frequency SAS data set that spans
multiple environments. The SME's were presented pairs of images from which they
could rate the relative image complexity. These comparisons were then converted
into the desired sequential ranking using a method first developed by A. Elo
for establishing rankings of chess players.
  The Elo method produced a plausible rank ordering across the broad dataset.
The heuristic and information theoretical metrics were then compared to the
image rank from which they were derived. The metrics with the highest degree of
correlation were those relating to spatial information, e.g. variations in
pixel intensity, with an R-squared value of approximately 0.9. However, this
agreement was dependent on the scale from which the spatial variation was
measured. Results will also be presented for many other measures including
lacunarity, image compression, and entropy.

electron cyclotron frequency. Electromagnetic waves in the electron cyclotron
range of frequencies are unsuitable for directly heating such plasmas due to
their reduced accessibility. However, mode-conversion of the extraordinary wave
to the electron Bernstein wave (X-B mode-conversion) at the upper hybrid
resonance makes it possible to efficiently couple externally-launched
electromagnetic wave energy into an overdense plasma core. Traditional
mode-conversion models describe an X-mode wave propagating in a potential
containing two cutoffs that bracket a single wave resonance. Often, however,
the mode-conversion region is in the edge, where turbulent fluctuations and
blobs can generate abrupt cutoffs and scattering of the incident X-mode wave.
We present a new framework for studying the X-B mode-conversion which makes the
inclusion of these fluctuations analytically tractable. In the new approach,
the high-field cutoff is modelled as an infinite barrier, which manifests as a
boundary condition applied to a wave equation involving only one cutoff
adjacent to the resonance on the low-field side. The new model reproduces the
main features of the previous approach, yet is more suitable for analyzing
experimental observations and extrapolating to higher dimensions. We then
develop an analytical estimate for the effect of small-amplitude,
quasi-monochromatic density fluctuations on the X-B mode-conversion efficiency
using perturbation theory. We find that Bragg backscattering of the launched
X-mode wave reduces the mode-conversion efficiency significantly when the
fluctuation wavenumber is resonant with the wavenumber of the incident X-mode
wave. These analytical results are corroborated by numerically integrating the
mode-conversion equations.

$\mathcal{K}^*$ cuts derived from conic certificates for continuous primal-dual
conic subproblems. Under the assumption that all subproblems are well-posed,
the algorithm detects infeasibility or unboundedness or returns an optimal
solution in finite time. Using properties of the conic certificates, we show
that the $\mathcal{K}^*$ cuts imply certain practically-relevant guarantees
about the quality of the polyhedral relaxations, and demonstrate how to
maintain helpful guarantees when the LP solver uses a positive feasibility
tolerance. We discuss how to disaggregate $\mathcal{K}^*$ cuts in order to
tighten the polyhedral relaxations and thereby improve the speed of
convergence, and propose fast heuristic methods of obtaining useful
$\mathcal{K}^*$ cuts. Our new open source MI-conic solver Pajarito

However, we convert an arbitrary sentences of an arbitrary source speaker to
target speaker's given only one target speaker training utterance. To achieve
this, we formulate the problem as learning disentangled speaker-specific and
context-specific representations and follow the idea of [1] which uses
Factorized Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder (FHVAE). After training FHVAE
on multi-speaker training data, given arbitrary source and target speakers'
utterance, we estimate those latent representations and then reconstruct the
desired utterance of converted voice to that of target speaker. We investigate
the effectiveness of the approach by conducting voice conversion experiments
with varying size of training utterances and it was able to achieve reasonable
performance with even just one training utterance. We also examine the speech
representation and show that World vocoder outperforms Short-time Fourier

significantly better or comparable results compared to VAE-STFT and GMM

reference star differential imaging (RDI). We find that for the typical
parallactic angle (PA) rotation of our dataset ($\sim$10$^{\circ}$), RDI
provides gains over ADI for angular separations smaller than
0.25$^{\prime\prime}$. Furthermore, we find a power-law relation between the
angular separation from the host star and the minimum PA rotation required for
ADI to outperform RDI, with a power-law index of -1.18$\pm$0.08. Finally, we
use random forest models to estimate ADI and RDI post-processed detection
limits a priori. These models, which we provide publicly on a website, explain
70%-80% of the variance in ADI detection limits and 30%-50% of the variance in
RDI detection limits. Averaged over a range of angular separations, our models
predict both ADI and RDI contrast to within a factor of 2. These results

known to hold for geometrical states (i.e. states of holographic theories with
gravitational duals describing a classical bulk geometry). In particular, we
provide a novel proof of MMI, using bit threads directly. To this end, we
present an explicit geometrical construction of cooperative flows which we
build out of disjoint thread bundles. We conjecture that our method applies in
a wide class of configurations, including ones with non-trivial topology,
causal structure, and time dependence. The explicit nature of the construction
reveals that MMI is more deeply rooted in bulk locality than is the case for
strong subadditivity.

coarsening of the flux formulation leads to optimal convergence and is
equivalent to a purely geometric multigrid method. The resulting

lifting operators, and other mesh-related quantities on coarse meshes. We show
that good multigrid convergence rates are achieved in a variety of numerical

problems with complex geometry. Extension to non-LDG discretizations is briefly

The result prefers $\kappa = 2/3$ for the case of isotropic contraction, and
the difference of the observed value from $\kappa = 1/2$ is 2.8 sigma. The

interacting chemical species. Stochastic models are typically used when the
counts of the molecules are low, whereas deterministic models are used when the
counts are in high abundance. In 2011, the notion of `tiers' was introduced to
study the long time behavior of deterministically modeled reaction networks
that are weakly reversible and have a single linkage class. This `tier' based
argument was analytical in nature. Later, in 2014, the notion of a strongly
endotactic network was introduced in order to generalize the previous results
from weakly reversible networks with a single linkage class to this wider
family of networks. The point of view of this later work was more geometric and
algebraic in nature. The notion of strongly endotactic networks was later used
in 2018 to prove a large deviation principle for a class of stochastically
modeled reaction networks.
  We provide an analytical characterization of strongly endotactic networks in
terms of tier structures. By doing so, we shed light on the connection between
the two points of view, and also make available a new proof technique for the
study of strongly endotactic networks. We show the power of this new technique
in two distinct ways. First, we demonstrate how the main previous results
related to strongly endotactic networks, both for the deterministic and
stochastic modeling choices, can be quickly obtained from our characterization.
Second, we demonstrate how new results can be obtained by proving that a
sub-class of strongly endotactic networks, when modeled stochastically, is
positive recurrent. Finally, and similarly to recent independent work by Agazzi
and Mattingly, we provide an example which closes a conjecture in the negative
by showing that stochastically modeled strongly endotactic networks can be
transient (and even explosive).

  Inverse Problems",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Numerous tasks at the core of statistics, learning and vision areas are
specific cases of ill-posed inverse problems. Recently, learning-based (e.g.,
deep) iterative methods have been empirically shown to be useful for these
problems. Nevertheless, integrating learnable structures into iterations is
still a laborious process, which can only be guided by intuitions or empirical
insights. Moreover, there is a lack of rigorous analysis about the convergence
behaviors of these reimplemented iterations, and thus the significance of such
methods is a little bit vague. This paper moves beyond these limits and
proposes Flexible Iterative Modularization Algorithm (FIMA), a generic and
provable paradigm for nonconvex inverse problems. Our theoretical analysis
reveals that FIMA allows us to generate globally convergent trajectories for
learning-based iterative methods. Meanwhile, the devised scheduling policies on
flexible modules should also be beneficial for classical numerical methods in
the nonconvex scenario. Extensive experiments on real applications verify the
superiority of FIMA.

At each time step, we choose one of the possible $K$ functions, $g_1, \ldots,

probability distribution of $X$ by using a minimum number of such sequential
samples. This problem has several real-world applications including inference
under non-precise information and privacy-preserving statistical estimation. We
establish necessary and sufficient conditions on the functions $g_1, \ldots,
g_K$ under which asymptotically consistent estimation is possible. We also
derive lower bounds on the estimation error as a function of total samples and
show that it is order-wise achievable. Leveraging these results, we propose an
iterative algorithm that i) chooses the function to observe at each step based
on past observations; and ii) combines the obtained samples to estimate $p_X$.
The performance of this algorithm is investigated numerically under various

  Models","Published at 19th International Society for Music Information
  Retrieval Conference",,,,"cs.SD cs.LG eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Chord recognition systems typically comprise an acoustic model that predicts
chords for each audio frame, and a temporal model that casts these predictions

smooth predictions, without being able to incorporate musical information about
chord progressions. Recent research discovered that it might be the low
hierarchical level such models have been applied to (directly on audio frames)
which prevents learning musical relationships, even for expressive models such
as recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, if applied on the level of chord
sequences, RNNs indeed can become powerful chord predictors. In this paper, we
disentangle temporal models into a harmonic language model---to be applied on
chord sequences---and a chord duration model that connects the chord-level
predictions of the language model to the frame-level predictions of the
acoustic model. In our experiments, we explore the impact of each model on the
chord recognition score, and show that using harmonic language and duration
models improves the results.

balance the weighted covariate distribution of each treatment group, all
weighted toward a common pre-specified target population. The class of
balancing weights include several existing approaches such as the inverse
probability weights and trimming weights as special cases. Within this
framework, we propose a set of target estimands based on linear contrasts. We
further develop the generalized overlap weights, constructed as the product of
the inverse probability weights and the harmonic mean of the generalized
propensity scores. The generalized overlap weighting scheme corresponds to the
target population with the most overlap in covariates across the multiple
treatments. These weights are bounded and thus bypass the problem of extreme
propensities. We show that the generalized overlap weights minimize the total
asymptotic variance of the moment weighting estimators for the pairwise
contrasts within the class of balancing weights. We consider two balance check
criteria and propose a new sandwich variance estimator for estimating the
causal effects with generalized overlap weights. We apply these methods to

the degraded/processed speech with its clean counterpart. The need of a
""golden"" reference considerably restricts the practicality of such assessment
tools in real-world scenarios since the clean reference usually cannot be
accessed. On the other hand, human beings can readily evaluate the speech
quality without any reference (e.g., mean opinion score (MOS) tests), implying
the existence of an objective and non-intrusive (no clean reference needed)

non-intrusive speech quality evaluation model, termed Quality-Net, based on
bidirectional long short-term memory. The evaluation of utterance-level quality
in Quality-Net is based on the frame-level assessment. Frame constraints and
sensible initializations of forget gate biases are applied to learn meaningful
frame-level quality assessment from the utterance-level quality label.
Experimental results show that Quality-Net can yield high correlation to PESQ
(0.9 for the noisy speech and 0.84 for the speech processed by speech
enhancement). We believe that Quality-Net has potential to be used in a wide

restrict ourselves to homogeneously mixed communities. We present our general
model and study the early stage of the epidemic in chapter 1. Chapter 2 studies
the particular case of Markov models, especially in the asymptotic of a large
population, which leads to a law of large numbers and a central limit theorem.
Chapter 3 considers the case of a closed population, and describes the final
size of the epidemic (i.e. the total number of individuals who ever get
infected). Chapter 4 considers models with a constant influx of susceptibles
(either by birth, immigration of loss of immunity of recovered individuals),
and exploits the CLT and Large Deviations to study how long it takes for the
stochastic disturbances to stop an endemic situation which is stable for the
deterministic epidemic model. The document ends with an Appendix which presents
several mathematical notions which are used in these notes, as well as
solutions to many of the exercises which are proposed in the various chapters.

domain adaptation, where the goal is to learn a model on a target domain using
a similar --but not identical-- source domain. The rationale for coupling both
techniques is the possibility of extracting common concepts across domains.
Considering (strictly) local representations, traditional deep learning assumes
common concepts must be captured in the same hidden units. We contend that
jointly training a model with source and target data using a single deep
network is prone to failure when there is inherently lower-level
representational discrepancy between the two domains; such discrepancy leads to
a misalignment of corresponding concepts in separate hidden units. We introduce
a search framework to correctly align high-level representations when training
deep networks; such framework leads to the notion of conceptual --as opposed to
representational-- domain adaptation.

explore numerical dynamo simulations that include an Jupiter-like electrical

concentrate on analyzing the dynamo action in the Steeply Decaying Conductivity
Region (SDCR) where the high conductivity in the metallic Hydrogen region drops
to the much lower values caused by ionization effects in the very outer
envelope of the planet. Our simulations show that the dynamo action in the SDCR
is strongly ruled by diffusive effects and therefore quasi stationary. The
locally induced magnetic field is dominated by the horizontal toroidal field,
while the locally induced currents flow mainly in the latitudinal direction.
The simple dynamics can be exploited to yield estimates of surprisingly high
quality for both the induced field and the electric currents in the SDCR. These
could be potentially be exploited to predict the dynamo action of the zonal
winds in Jupiter's SDCR but also in other planets.

deal with the difficulty caused by the unproximable property of the summation

as Venus or a tidally locked planet (not necessarily a slow-rotator) such as a
hot Jupiter, the tracer distribution could exhibit significant longitudinal
inhomogeneity and tracer transport is intrinsically 3D. Here we study the
global-mean vertical tracer transport on tidally locked planets using 3D
tracer-transport simulations. We find that our analytical $K_{zz}$ theory in
Paper I is validated on tidally locked planets over a wide parameter space.
$K_{zz}$ strongly depends on the large-scale circulation strength, horizontal
mixing due to eddies and waves and local tracer sources and sinks due to
chemistry and microphysics. As our analytical theory predicted, $K_{zz}$ on
tidally locked planets also exhibit three regimes In Regime I where the
chemical and microphysical processes are uniformly distributed across the
globe, different chemical species should be transported via different eddy
diffusivity. In Regime II where the chemical and microphysical processes are
non-uniform---for example, photochemistry or cloud formation that exhibits
strong day-night contrast---the global-mean vertical tracer mixing does not
always behave diffusively. In the third regime where the tracer is long-lived,
non-diffusive effects are significant. Using species-dependent eddy
diffusivity, we provide a new analytical theory of the dynamical quench points

PB-CT algorithms that perform phase retrieval of individual projections, the
described post-reconstruction phase-retrieval method is applied in 3D to a
localised region of the CT-reconstructed volume. We demonstrate via numerical
simulations the accuracy and noise characteristics of the method under a

absorption tomography and two-dimensional (2D) TIE-Hom phase retrieval applied
to projection images. The results indicate that the 3D post-reconstruction
method generally achieves a modest improvement in noise suppression over
existing PB-CT methods. It is also shown that potentially large computational
gains over projection-based phase retrieval for multi-material samples are
possible. In particular, constraining phase retrieval to a localised 3D region
of interest reduces the overall computational cost and eliminates the need for
multiple CT reconstructions and global 2D phase retrieval operations for each

processing (NLP). Word clusters are used to deal with sparse data in
statistical language processing, as well as features for solving various NLP
tasks (text categorization, question answering, named entity recognition and
others).
  Spectral clustering is a widely used technique in the field of image
processing and speech recognition. However, it has scarcely been explored in
the context of NLP; specifically, the method used in this (Meila and Shi, 2001)
has never been used to cluster a general word lexicon.
  We apply spectral clustering to a lexicon of words, evaluating the resulting
clusters by using them as features for solving two classical NLP tasks:
semantic role labeling and dependency parsing. We compare performance with
Brown clustering, a widely-used technique for word clustering, as well as with
other clustering methods. We show that spectral clusters produce similar
results to Brown clusters, and outperform other clustering methods. In
addition, we quantify the overlap between spectral and Brown clusters, showing
that each model captures some information which is uncaptured by the other.

flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene at magic angle are manifestations of the
nontrivial topology of two-dimensional real wave functions characterized by the
Euler class. To prove this, we examine the generic band topology of two
dimensional real fermions in systems with space-time inversion $I_{ST}$
symmetry. The Euler class is an integer topological invariant classifying real
two band systems. We show that a two-band system with a nonzero Euler class
cannot have an $I_{ST}$-symmetric Wannier representation. Moreover, a two-band
system with the Euler class $e_{2}$ has band crossing points whose total
winding number is equal to $-2e_2$. Thus the conventional Nielsen-Ninomiya
theorem fails in systems with a nonzero Euler class. We propose that the
topological phase transition between two insulators carrying distinct Euler
classes can be described in terms of the pair creation and annihilation of
vortices accompanied by winding number changes across Dirac strings. When the
number of bands is bigger than two, there is a $Z_{2}$ topological invariant
classifying the band topology, that is, the second Stiefel Whitney class
($w_2$). Two bands with an even (odd) Euler class turn into a system with
$w_2=0$ ($w_2=1$) when additional trivial bands are added. Although the
nontrivial second Stiefel-Whitney class remains robust against adding trivial
bands, it does not impose a Wannier obstruction when the number of bands is
bigger than two. However, when the resulting multi-band system with the
nontrivial second Stiefel-Whitney class is supplemented by additional chiral
symmetry, a nontrivial second-order topology and the associated corner charges
are guaranteed.

hours and are marked with a red square at the location of the typhoon center.
The GAN uses images from the past to generate an image one time step ahead. The
generated image shows the future location of the typhoon center, as well as the
future cloud structures. The errors between predicted and real typhoon centers
are measured quantitatively in kilometers. 42.4% of all typhoon center
predictions have absolute errors of less than 80 km, 32.1% lie within a range
of 80 - 120 km and the remaining 25.5% have accuracies above 120 km. The
relative error sets the above mentioned absolute error in relation to the
distance that has been traveled by a typhoon over the past 6 hours. High
relative errors are found in three types of situations, when a typhoon moves on
the open sea far away from land, when a typhoon changes its course suddenly and
when a typhoon is about to hit the mainland. The cloud structure prediction is
evaluated qualitatively. It is shown that the GAN is able to predict trends in
cloud motion. In order to improve both, the typhoon center and cloud motion
prediction, the present study suggests to add information about the sea surface
temperature, surface pressure and velocity fields to the input data.

X-/$\gamma$-rays. Since their discovery over 50 years ago, GRBs are primarily
studied through spectral and temporal measurements. The properties of the
emission jets and underlying processes are not well understood. A promising way
forward is the development of missions capable of characterising the linear
polarisation of the high-energy emission. For this reason, the SPHiNX mission
has been developed for a small-satellite platform. The polarisation properties
of incident high-energy radiation (50-600 keV) are determined by reconstructing
Compton scattering interactions in a segmented array of plastic and
Gd$_3$Al$_2$Ga$_3$O$_{12}$(Ce) (GAGG(Ce)) scintillators. During a two-year
mission, $\sim$200 GRBs will be observed, with $\sim$50 yielding measurements
where the polarisation fraction is determined with a relative error $\leq$10%.
This is a significant improvement compared to contemporary missions. This
performance, combined with the ability to reconstruct GRB localisation and
spectral properties, will allow discrimination between leading classes of

Firstly we consider test
field Skyrmions on the Kerr background. These configurations -- hereafter
dubbed Skerrmions -- can be in equilibrium with a Kerr black hole (BH) by
virtue of a synchronisation condition. We consider two sectors for Skerrmions.
In the sector with non-zero baryon charge, Skerrmions are akin to the known
Skyrme solutions on the Schwarzschild background. These `topological'
configurations reduce to flat spacetime Skyrmions in a vanishing BH mass limit;
moreoever, they never become ""small"" perturbations on the Kerr background: the
non-linearities of the Skyrme model are crucial for all such Skerrmions. In the
non-topological sector, on the other hand, Skerrmions have no analogue on the
Schwarzschild background. Non-topological Skerrmions carry not baryon charge
and bifurcate from a subset of Kerr solutions defining an existence line.
Therein the appropriate truncation of the Skyrme model yield a linear scalar
field theory containing a complex plus a real field, both massive and
decoupled, and the Skerrmions reduce to the known stationary scalar clouds
around Kerr BHs. Moreover, non-topological Skerrmions trivialise in the
vanishing BH mass limit. We then discuss the backreaction of these Skerrmions,
that yield rotating BHs with synchronised Skyrme hair, which continously
connect to the Kerr solution (self-gravitating Skyrmions) in the
non-topological (topological) sector. In particular, the non-topological hairy
BHs provide a non-linear realisation, within the Skyrme model, of the
synchronous stationary scalar clouds around Kerr.

interaction was seldom explored. We construct a quantum Otto heat engine with N
repulsive Bosonic particles in a 1D hard wall box. With the advantage of exact
solution using Bethe Ansatz, we obtain not only the exact numerical result of
efficiency in all interacting strength c, but also analytical results for
strong interaction. We find the efficiency \eta recovers to the one of
non-interacting case $\eta_{\mathrm{non}}=1-(L_{1}/L_{2})^{2}$ for strong
interaction with asympotic behavior
$\eta\sim\eta_{\mathrm{non}}-4(N-1)L_{1}\left(L_{2}-L_{1}\right)/(cL_{2}^{3})$.
Here, $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ are two trap sizes during the cycle. Such recovery
reflects the duality between 1D strongly repulsive Bosons and free Fermion. We
observe and explain the appearance of a minimum efficiency at a particular
interacting strength c, and study its dependence on the temperature.

(3DMM) is a powerful tool for reconstructing the 3D face from a single 2D face
image. In the shape fitting process, 3DMM estimates the correspondence between
2D and 3D landmarks. Most traditional 3DMM fitting methods fail to reconstruct
an accurate model because face shape fitting is a difficult non-linear
optimization problem. In this paper we show that landmark weighting is
instrumental to improve the accuracy of shape reconstruction and propose a
novel 3D Morphable Model Fitting method. Different from previous works that
treat all landmarks equally, we take into consideration the estimated errors
for each pair of 2D and 3D corresponding landmarks. The landmark points are
weighted in the optimization cost function based on these errors. Obviously,
these landmarks have different semantics because they locate on different
facial components. In the context of the solution of fitting is approximated,
there are deviations in landmarks matching. However, these landmarks with
different semantics have different effects on reconstructing 3D faces. Thus, it
is necessary to consider each landmark individually. To our knowledge, we are
the first to analyze each feature point for 3D face reconstruction by 3DMM. The
weight is adaptive with the estimation residuals of landmarks. Experimental
results show that the proposed method significantly reduces the reconstruction
error and improves the authenticity of the 3D model expression.

racemic mixture of chiral molecules is a well-accepted prerequisite for all
routes to biological homochirality. Some models have suggested that such
amplification occurred due to asymmetric discrimination of chiral biotic or
prebiotic molecules when they adsorbed onto crystalline surfaces. While chiral
amplification has been demonstrated on surfaces of both chiral and achiral
crystals, the mechanism that would produce an enantiomeric imbalance in the
chiral surfaces themselves has not been addressed. Here we report strong chiral
amplification in the colloidal synthesis of intrinsically chiral lanthanide
phosphate nanocrystals, quantitatively measured via the circularly polarized
luminescence of the lanthanide ions within the nanocrystals. The amplification
involves spontaneous symmetry breaking into either left- or right-handed
nanocrystals below a critical temperature. Furthermore, chiral tartaric acid
molecules in the solution act as an external chiral field, sensitively
directing the amplified nanocrystal handedness through a discontinuous
transition between left- and right-handed excess. These characteristics suggest
a conceptual framework for chiral amplification, based on the statistical
thermodynamics of critical phenomena, which we use to quantitatively account
for the observations. Our results demonstrate how chiral minerals with high

nominal system dynamics; and an additive state feedback law which is computed

a hyper-tube centered along the nominal trajectory, for all times. The volume
of the hyper-tube depends on the upper bound of the disturbances as well as the
bounds of the derivatives of the dynamics. In addition, by introducing certain
distance constraints, the proposed scheme guarantees that the initially
connected agents remain connected for all times. Under standard assumptions
that arise in nominal NMPC schemes, controllability assumptions as well as
communication capabilities between the agents, we guarantee that the
multi-agent system is ISS (Input to State Stable) with respect to the
disturbances, for all initial conditions satisfying the state constraints.
Simulation results verify the correctness of the proposed framework.

well-being measures with development activities, i.e. number of commits and

questionnaire variables and software repository variables. To our surprise
relationship between hurry and number of commits is negative, meaning more
perceived hurry is linked with a smaller number of commits. We also find a

increased efficiency under time pressure. Overall, our work is an initial step

schemes whose training and feedback stages are interleaved and mutually

first trains all of its antennas at once and then receives a single feedback
message, we consider a scenario where the transmitter instead trains its
antennas one by one and receives feedback information immediately after
training each one of its antennas. The feedback message may ask the transmitter
to train another antenna; or, it may terminate the feedback/training phase and
provide the quantized codeword (e.g., a beamforming vector) to be utilized for
data transmission. As a specific application, we consider a multiple-input
single-output system with $t$ transmit antennas, a short-term power constraint
$P$, and target data rate $\rho$. We show that for any $t$, the same outage
probability as a system with perfect transmitter and receiver channel state
information can be achieved with a feedback rate of $R_1$ bits per channel
state and via training $R_2$ transmit antennas on average, where $R_1$ and
$R_2$ are independent of $t$, and depend only on $\rho$ and $P$. In addition,
we design variable-rate quantizers for channel coefficients to further minimize

[OII] can also be excited in low-density gas located at appreciable distances
from the nucleus, but still ionized by the AGN. These AGN extended emission
line regions (EELRs) can contribute significant flux to integrated spectra,
even in the presence of luminous AGN. Here, we identify EELRs by the presence
of the [NeV] 3426\AA\ emission line, which, like [OII], is not strongly excited
in the inner regions of AGN, but is a prominent emission line in the lower
density EELRs. Critically, unlike [OII], [NeV] is not excited by star
formation. Therefore, when strong [NeV] is present in an AGN spectrum, the flux
from the EELR is not negligible, implying the [OII] flux is contaminated by
emission from the EELR, and is not a good measure of star formation. After
removing objects with EELRs identified by [NeV], the [OII] flux in the host
galaxies of radio-loud AGN is found to be higher than that within radio-quiet
AGN, which could either indicate higher star-formation rates, or the presence

fields from observations of systems governed by single or multiple forward
models. In many cases these parameter fields reflect different attributes of a
single medium and are thus spatially correlated or structurally similar. By
imposing prior information on their spatial correlations via a joint
regularization term, we seek to improve the reconstruction of the parameter
fields relative to inversion for each field independently. One of the main
challenges is to devise a joint regularization functional that conveys the
spatial correlations or structural similarity between the fields while at the
same time permitting scalable and efficient solvers for the joint inverse
problem. We describe several joint regularizations that are motivated by these
goals: a cross-gradient and a normalized cross-gradient structural similarity
term, the vectorial total variation, and a joint regularization based on the
nuclear norm of the gradients. Based on numerical results from three classes of
inverse problems with piecewise-homogeneous parameter fields, we conclude that
the vectorial total variation functional is preferable to the other methods
considered. Besides resulting in good reconstructions in all experiments, it
allows for scalable, efficient solvers for joint inverse problems governed by
PDE forward models.

implementations is vital and may become the weak link in the whole network
ecosystem. In previous works, some research focused on the automated testing of
certificate verification, and the main approaches rely on generating massive
certificates through randomly combining parts of seed certificates for fuzzing.
Although the generated certificates could meet the semantic constraints, the
cost is quite heavy, and the performance is limited due to the randomness. To
fill this gap, in this paper, we propose DRLGENCERT, the first framework of
applying deep reinforcement learning to the automated testing of certificate
verification in SSL/TLS implementations. DRLGENCERT accepts ordinary
certificates as input and outputs newly generated certificates which could
trigger discrepancies with high efficiency. Benefited by the deep reinforcement
learning, when generating certificates, our framework could choose the best
next action according to the result of a previous modification, instead of
simple random combinations. At the same time, we developed a set of new
techniques to support the overall design, like new feature extraction method
for X.509 certificates, fine-grained differential testing, and so forth. Also,
we implemented a prototype of DRLGENCERT and carried out a series of real-world
experiments. The results show DRLGENCERT is quite efficient, and we obtained
84,661 discrepancy-triggering certificates from 181,900 certificate seeds, say
around 46.5% effectiveness. Also, we evaluated six popular SSL/TLS
implementations, including GnuTLS, MatrixSSL, MbedTLS, NSS, OpenSSL, and
wolfSSL. DRLGENCERT successfully discovered 23 serious certificate verification

These oscillations are driven by two mass-squared differences, solar and
atmospheric, at the sub-eV scale. However, longstanding anomalies at
short-baselines might imply the existence of new oscillation frequencies at the
eV-scale and the possibility of this sterile state(s) to mix with the three
active neutrinos. One of the many future neutrino programs that are expected to
provide a final word on this issue is the Short-Baseline Neutrino Program (SBN)
at FERMILAB. In this letter, we consider a specific model of Large Extra

sterile states. We started re-creating sensitivity analyses for sterile
neutrinos in the 3+1 scenario, previously done by the SBN collaboration, by
simulating neutrino events in the three SBN detectors from both muon neutrino
disappearance and electron neutrino appearance. Then, we implemented neutrino
oscillations as predicted in the LED model and also we have performed
sensitivity analysis to the LED parameters. Finally, we studied the SBN power
of discriminating between the two models, the 3+1 and the LED. We have found
that SBN is sensitive to the oscillations predicted in the LED model and have
the potential to constrain the LED parameter space better than any other
oscillation experiment, for $m_{1}^D<0.1\,\text{eV}$. In case SBN observes a
departure from the three active neutrino framework, it also has the power of
discriminating between sterile oscillations predicted in the 3+1 framework and

collision data from RHIC (0.2 ATeV), LHC1 (2.76 ATeV), and recent LHC2 (5.02
ATeV) energies using the updated CUJET framework. The framework consistently
combines viscous hydrodynamic fields predicted by VISHNU2+1 (validated with
soft $p_T<2$~GeV bulk observables) and the DGLV theory of jet elastic and
inelastic energy loss generalized to QGP fluids with an sQGMP color structure,
including effective semi-QGP color electric quark and gluon as well as emergent
color magnetic monopole degrees of freedom constrained by lattice QCD data. We
vary the two control parameters of the model (the maximum value of the running
QCD coupling, $\alpha_c$, and the ratio $c_m$ of color magnetic to electric
screening scales) and calculate the global $\chi^2(\alpha_c,c_m)$ compared with
available jet fragment observables ($R_{AA}, v_2$). A global $\chi^2<2$ minimum
is found with $\alpha_c \approx 0.9\pm 0.1$ and $c_m\approx 0.25\pm 0.03$.
Using CIBJET, the event-by-event (ebe) generalization of the CUJET framework,
we show that ebe fluctuations in the initial conditions do not significantly
alter our conclusions (except for $v_3$). An important theoretical advantage of
the CUJET and CIBJET frameworks is not only its global $\chi^2$ consistency
with jet fragment observables at RHIC and LHC and with non-perturbative lattice
QCD data, but also its internal consistency of the constrained jet transport
coefficient, $\hat{q}(E,T)/T^3$, with the near-perfect fluid viscosity to
entropy ratio ($\eta/s \sim T^3/\hat{q}\sim 0.1-0.2$) property of QCD fluids
near $T_c$ needed to account for the low $p_T<2$ GeV flow observables.

shown that while the insertion of a metallic nanoparticle by itself can produce
negative, inward-directed, pressure on the outer shell, addition of only a
small amount of multivalent counterions can robustly engender negative
pressures, enhancing the VLP stability across a wide range of values for the
system parameters.

out-of-distribution images is therefore crucial for many real-world
applications. We divide out-of-distribution detection between novelty detection
---images of classes which are not in the training set but are related to
those---, and anomaly detection ---images with classes which are unrelated to
the training set. By related we mean they contain the same type of objects,

detection, and has addressed this problem considering networks trained with the
cross-entropy loss. Differently from them, we propose to use metric learning

of two-dimensional honeycomb iridates, such as $\alpha$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$, which
recently appeared as another playground for the physics of Kitaev-type spin
liquid. $\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$ shows a non-collinear spiral ordering of
spin-orbital-entangled $J_{\rm eff}$ = 1/2 moments at low temperature, which is
known to be suppressed under a pressure of $\sim$2 GPa. With further increase
of pressure, a structural transition is observed at $P_{\rm S}$ $\sim$ 4 GPa at
room temperature. Using the neutron powder diffraction technique, the crystal
structure in the high-pressure phase of $\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$ above $P_{\rm S}$
was refined, which indicates the formation of Ir$_2$ dimers on the zig-zag
chains, with the Ir-Ir distance even shorter than that of metallic Ir. We argue
that the strong dimerization stabilizes the bonding molecular orbital state
comprising the two local $d_{zx}$-orbitals on the Ir-O$_2$-Ir bond plane, which
conflicts with the equal superposition of $d_{xy}$-, $d_{yz}$- and $d_{zx}$-
orbitals in the $J_{\rm eff}$ = 1/2 wave function produced by strong spin-orbit
coupling. The results of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS)
measurements and the electronic structure calculations are fully consistent
with the collapse of the $J_{\rm eff}$ = 1/2 state. A subtle competition of
various electronic phases is universal in honeycomb-based Kitaev materials.

coordinates of an underlying vector $f \in \mathbb{R}^n$, a perfect $L_p$
sampler must output an index $i$ with probability $|f_i|^p/\|f\|_p^p$, and is
allowed to fail with some probability $\delta$. So far, for $p > 0$ no
algorithm has been shown to solve the problem exactly using $\text{poly}( \log
n)$-bits of space. In 2010, Monemizadeh and Woodruff introduced an approximate
$L_p$ sampler, which outputs $i$ with probability $(1 \pm \nu)|f_i|^p
/\|f\|_p^p$, using space polynomial in $\nu^{-1}$ and $\log(n)$. The space
complexity was later reduced by Jowhari, Sa\u{g}lam, and Tardos to roughly
$O(\nu^{-p} \log^2 n \log \delta^{-1})$ for $p \in (0,2)$, which tightly
matches the $\Omega(\log^2 n \log \delta^{-1})$ lower bound in terms of $n$ and
$\delta$, but is loose in terms of $\nu$.
  Given these nearly tight bounds, it is perhaps surprising that no lower bound
exists in terms of $\nu$---not even a bound of $\Omega(\nu^{-1})$ is known. In
this paper, we explain this phenomenon by demonstrating the existence of an
$O(\log^2 n \log \delta^{-1})$-bit perfect $L_p$ sampler for $p \in (0,2)$.
This shows that $\nu$ need not factor into the space of an $L_p$ sampler, which
closes the complexity of the problem for this range of $p$. For $p=2$, our
bound is $O(\log^3 n \log \delta^{-1})$-bits, which matches the prior best
known upper bound in terms of $n,\delta$, but has no dependence on $\nu$. For
$p<2$, our bound holds in the random oracle model, matching the lower bounds in
that model. Moreover, we show that our algorithm can be derandomized with only
a $O((\log \log n)^2)$ blow-up in the space (and no blow-up for $p=2$). Our
derandomization technique is general, and can be used to derandomize a large

task in machine learning for healthcare that can provide clinicians with better

biomarker trajectories. In addition, they do not model multiple biomarkers
jointly and need to align subjects' trajectories. In this paper, recurrent
neural networks (RNNs) are utilized to address these issues. However, in many
cases, longitudinal cohorts contain incomplete data, which hinders the
application of standard RNNs and requires a pre-processing step such as
imputation of the missing values. We, therefore, propose a generalized training
rule for the most widely used RNN architecture, long short-term memory (LSTM)
networks, that can handle missing values in both target and predictor
variables. This algorithm is applied for modeling the progression of
Alzheimer's disease (AD) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers. The
results show that the proposed LSTM algorithm achieves a lower mean absolute
error for prediction of measurements across all considered MRI biomarkers
compared to using standard LSTM networks with data imputation or using a
regression-based DPM method. Moreover, applying linear discriminant analysis to
the biomarkers' values predicted by the proposed algorithm results in a larger
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for clinical
diagnosis of AD compared to the same alternatives, and the AUC is comparable to
state-of-the-art AUCs from a recent cross-sectional medical image
classification challenge. This paper shows that built-in handling of missing
values in LSTM network training paves the way for application of RNNs in
disease progression modeling.

$R_{D^{(*)}}$, are often interpreted as hints for physics beyond the Standard
Model. To this end, leptoquarks or a heavy $Z'$ represent the most popular SM
extensions which can explain the observations. However, adding these fields by
hand is not very satisfactory as it does not address the big questions like a
possible embedding into a unified gauge theory. On the other hand, light
leptoquarks within a unified framework are challenging due to additional
constraints such as lepton flavor violation. The existing accounts typically
deal with this issue by providing estimates on the relevant couplings. In this
letter we consider a complete model based on the $SU(4)_{\rm C}\otimes
SU(2)_{\rm L}\otimes U(1)_{\rm R}$ gauge symmetry, a subgroup of $SO(10)$,
featuring both scalar and vector leptoquarks. We demonstrate that this setup
has, in principle, all the potential to accommodate $R_{K^{(*)}}$ and
$R_{D^{(*)}}$ while respecting bounds from other sectors usually checked in
this context. However, it turns out that $K_L \to e^{\pm} \mu^{\mp}$ severely
constraints not only the vector but also the scalar leptoquarks and,
consequently, also the room for any sizeable deviations of $R_{K^{(*)}}$ from
1. We briefly comment on the options for extending the model in order to
conform this constraint. Moreover, we present a simple criterion for all-orders
proton stability within this class of models.

studied as a function of the distance from the center of the Sun. For this
study, we developed a method using the coronal magnetic field as a tracer. The
field in a spherical layer from the base of the corona up to the source surface
was determined from photospheric measurements. Calculations were performed for
14 heliocentric distances from the base of the corona up to 2.45 solar radii
and from the equator to about 75 degrees of latitude at 5 degrees steps. For
each day, we calculated three components, which were then used to obtain the
field strength. The coronal rotation periods were determined by the periodogram
method for all distances and latitudes under consideration. The variations in
the coronal rotation during the time interval 1976-2004 were as follows: the
gradient of differential rotation decreased with the increase of heliocentric
distance; the rotation remaining differential even in the vicinity of the
source surface. The largest rotation rates were recorded at the cycle minimum
at small heights in the corona. The lowest rotation rate was observed at the
middle of the ascending branch at large distances. At the minimum of the cycle,
the differential rotation is most clearly pronounced, especially at small
heliocentric distances. As the distance increases, the differential gradient
decreases in all phases. The results based on magnetic data and on the
brightness of the coronal green line 530.3nm FeXIV used earlier show a
satisfactory agreement. Since the rotation of the magnetic field at the
corresponding heights in the corona is probably determined by the conditions in
the field generation region, an opportunity arises to use this method for
diagnostics of differential rotation in the subphotospheric layers.

verify through experiments that the proposed method is orthogonal to other

Combining the proposed method with them will bring even larger CNN speedup. For
instance, ND itself achieves about 2X speedup for the widely used VGG16, and

central and external stars play important roles. Considering the complicated
radiation surroundings in the clusters, where the star formed, the
proto-planetary discs survive in different lifetimes due to flyby events. In
this paper, we mainly focus on the disc around a T Tauri star, which encounters
with another main-sequence star with different temperatures in hyperbolic
orbits with different peri-center distances, eccentricities and inclinations.
We find the criterion for gap-opening due to photo-evaporation of central star
after the flyby event. A gap is opened in the late stage of gas disc, and
induce that the gap only influence the planet formation and migration
limitedly. If the flyby orbit has a moderate value of peri-center distance,
which weakly depends on the eccentricity and inclination, the external
photo-evaporation lead to a maximum mass loss during the flyby event. Flyby
stars in orbits with smaller eccentricities or larger inclinations induce
larger mass loss. Adopting a simple multiple flyby models, we conclude that in
open clusters, gas discs usually survive in typical lifetimes between 1 and 10
Myr, except there are many massive stars in dense open clusters. In globular
clusters, discs disperse very quickly and hardly produce the gas giant planets.
The fast-depleted discs are probably responsible for the null detection of
giant planets in globular clusters.

(PGD) Adversary is a universal first-order adversary, and the classifier
adversarially trained by PGD is robust against a wide range of first-order

model relies on a data distribution $p(\mathbf{x})$, typically in the form of
risk maximization/minimization, e.g.,
$\max/\min\mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf(x))}\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x})$ with
$p(\mathbf{x})$ some unknown data distribution and $\mathcal{L}(\cdot)$ a loss

data sample based on $\mathcal{L}(\cdot)$, the procedure does not necessarily
lead to good generalization in terms of risk optimization. In this paper, we
achieve the goal by proposing distributionally adversarial attack (DAA), a
framework to solve an optimal {\em adversarial-data distribution}, a perturbed

leverage complex analysis enabled by advanced portable computing power and use
simplified reagents. Nanotechnologists have created proof-of-concept devices to
move diagnosis and monitoring from large core labs to hand-held, easy-to-use
personal devices, but none have achieved large-scale manufacturability. We
demonstrate the first economical nanoelectronics produced in a commercial
foundry. The mass-manufacture of these graphene-based digital biosensors is
achieved by successfully integrating delicate graphene material into standard
electronic high-volume production processes. We describe critical manufacturing
parameters and the results of biosensing measurements that establish graphene
biosensors as a portable, low-cost method to gain precise data without labeled,
complex reagents. The low power and resource usage of these biosensors enable
individuals to gain personal, immediate control over precise biological and
environmental data.

complete test set (CTS). The conventional point of view is that to prove $N
\equiv 0$ one has to generate a trivial CTS. It consists of all $2^{|X|}$ input
assignments where $X$ is the set of input variables of $N$. We use the notion
of a Stable Set of Assignments (SSA) to show that one can build a non-trivial
CTS consisting of less than $2^{|X|}$ tests. Given an unsatisfiable CNF formula
$H(W)$, an SSA of $H$ is a set of assignments to $W$ that proves
unsatisfiability of $H$. A trivial SSA is the set of all $2^{|W|}$ assignments
to $W$. Importantly, real-life formulas can have non-trivial SSAs that are much
smaller than $2^{|W|}$. In general, construction of even non-trivial CTSs is
inefficient. We describe a much more efficient approach where tests are
extracted from an SSA built for a `projection' of $N$ on a subset of variables

captioning use deep reinforcement learning (RL) to alleviate the ""exposure
bias"" during training: ground-truth subsequence is exposed in every step
prediction, which introduces bias in test when only predicted subsequence is
seen. However, existing RL-based image captioning methods only focus on the
language policy while not the visual policy (e.g., visual attention), and thus
fail to capture the visual context that are crucial for compositional reasoning
such as visual relationships (e.g., ""man riding horse"") and comparisons (e.g.,
""smaller cat""). To fill the gap, we propose a Context-Aware Visual Policy
network (CAVP) for sequence-level image captioning. At every time step, CAVP
explicitly accounts for the previous visual attentions as the context, and then
decides whether the context is helpful for the current word generation given
the current visual attention. Compared against traditional visual attention
that only fixes a single image region at every step, CAVP can attend to complex
visual compositions over time. The whole image captioning model --- CAVP and
its subsequent language policy network --- can be efficiently optimized
end-to-end by using an actor-critic policy gradient method with respect to any
caption evaluation metric. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CAVP by
state-of-the-art performances on MS-COCO offline split and online server, using

that builds on real-time entity disambiguation and a learning-to-rank framework
to represent and update the rich semantic structure of news stories. Given a
target news story, specified by a seed set of documents, the goal is to
effectively select new story-relevant documents from an incoming document

problem as a learning-to-rank task. This enables us to track content with high
accuracy, from multiple domains, in real-time. We study a range of text, entity

local news stories that are easily over shadowed by other trending stories, and

Jeffreys divergence for exponential or mixture families. For this divergence,
we show that more relational equations and theorems similar to Euclidean space

perturbation $\sim h$, is an extremely small length $\mathcal{O} \sim 10^{-18}
- 10^{-21}$ meter. The recently proposed noncommutative structure of space has
a characteristic length-scale $\sqrt{\theta}$ which has an estimated
upper-bound in similar length-scale range. We therefore propose that GW data
can be used as an effective probe of noncommutative structure of space and
demonstrate how spatial noncommutativity modifies the responding frequency of
the resonant mass detectors of GW and also the corresponding probabilities of
GW induced transitions that the phonon modes of the resonant mass detectors
undergo. In this paper we present the complete perturbative calculation
involving both time-independent and time-dependent perturbation terms in the
Hamiltonian.

developing adaptive algorithms based on kernel functions. One of the main
features of these algorithms is that they form a family of universal
approximation techniques, solving problems with nonlinearities elegantly. In
this paper, we present data-selective adaptive kernel normalized least-mean
square (KNLMS) algorithms that can increase their learning rate and reduce
their computational complexity. In fact, these methods deal with kernel
expansions, creating a growing structure also known as the dictionary, whose
size depends on the number of observations and their innovation. The algorithms
described herein use an adaptive step-size to accelerate the learning and can
offer an excellent tradeoff between convergence speed and steady state, which
allows them to solve nonlinear filtering and estimation problems with a large
number of parameters without requiring a large computational cost. The
data-selective update scheme also limits the number of operations performed and
the size of the dictionary created by the kernel expansion, saving
computational resources and dealing with one of the major problems of kernel
adaptive algorithms. A statistical analysis is carried out along with a
computational complexity analysis of the proposed algorithms. Simulations show
that the proposed KNLMS algorithms outperform existing algorithms in examples
of nonlinear system identification and prediction of a time series originating
from a nonlinear difference equation.

coatings on AZ31 magnesium alloy in aluminate-tungstate electrolyte. Influences
of current frequency (such as 100, 1000 and 2000 Hz) on properties of the PEO
coatings have been explored. It was found that increment of frequency led to
coatings with higher thickness, higher roughness and darker appearance. In
order to explore the coating formation mechanism at different frequencies, the
micro-discharges at different frequencies were investigated by real-time
imaging method. Microstructure of coatings was characterized by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) assisted with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS). Coatings formed at 100 Hz show the most compact microstructure while
porosity of the coatings, both in the pore number and pore size, is greatly
increased at higher frequencies. The coatings formed at higher frequencies show
an increased atomic ratio of W/Al. The cancel of the negative pulse from the
pulsed waveform can also lead to a higher W/Al ratio, and hence a darker
coating. The higher porosity of the coatings was attributed to the stronger
plasma discharges and gas evolution at higher frequencies. The stronger plasma
discharge is induced by the fact that there is not sufficient time for the
cooling down of discharge channels at higher frequencies.

has been investigated in this work. An artificial black encrustation was
generated on the silver surface and its laser cleaning was performed using an
excimer laser (KrF based) working at a wavelength of 248 nm and pulse width 25
ns. Laser process parameters i.e. laser fluence and number of pulses were used
to perform the experiment and after different optical, microstructural,
elemental, microhardness and surface topography analysis of the laser ablated
zone was performed. The parametric window selected for the excimer laser
cleaning were laser fluence (200-400 mJ/cm2), repetition rate 4 Hz and number
of pulses (60-300). It was observed that excimer laser is very effective in the
cleaning of black encrustation having 6 wt. % of sulphur from the surface
without any significant removal of the silver substrate. The fluence value of
260.48 mJ/cm2 was observed as above threshold value for removal of sulphide
from the encrusted surface while a fluence of 384.85 mJ/cm2 and 220 pulses
showed the maximum removal of sulphur encrustation (0.38 wt. % of sulphur
remaining). Formation of the peripheral rim was observed to occur above 280.17
mJ/cm2 of fluence value. The topography of the ablated surface showed a removal
of 5-10 um of the sulphide layer from the surface whereas the thickness of the
sulphide coating was around 8-10 um. Microhardness value showed a change of
microhardness of the silver surface from 75.12 HV0.5 (uncoated parent silver)
to 96.07 HV0.5 (centre of the ablated zone).Finally, it was concluded that
excimer laser cleaning is a novel method for localized removal of silver

is essential for transportation planning. Traditionally, Automatic Traffic
Recorders (ATR) are used to collect this hourly volume data. These large
datasets are time series data characterized by long-term temporal dependencies
and missing values. Regarding the temporal dependencies, all roadways are
characterized by seasonal variations that can be weekly, monthly or yearly,
depending on the cause of the variation. Regarding the missing data in a
time-series sequence, traditional time series forecasting models perform poorly
under the influence of seasonal variations. To address this limitation, robust,
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based, multi-step ahead forecasting models are
developed for time-series in this study. The simple RNN, the Gated Recurrent
Unit (GRU) and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units are used to develop the
model and evaluate its performance. Two approaches are used to address the
missing value issue: masking and imputation, in conjunction with the RNN
models. Six different imputation algorithms are then used to identify the best
model. The analysis indicates that the LSTM model performs better than simple
RNN and GRU models, and imputation performs better than masking to predict
future traffic volume. Based on analysis using 92 ATRs, the LSTM-Median model
is deemed the best model in all scenarios for hourly traffic volume and AADT

continuous defect theory (CDT) and using recent advancements in size-dependent
continuum mechanics, we develop a fully coherent theoretical framework, denoted
as Consistent Continuous Defect Theory (C-CDT). Among several important
potential applications, C-CDT may provide a proper foundation to study the
continuum theory of crystal plasticity. The development presented here includes
an examination of the character of the bend-twist tensor, Weingarten's theorem,
Burgers and Frank vectors, continuous dislocation and disclination density
tensors, and the dualism between geometry and statics of CDT based on couple
stress theory (CST). Then, by using Consistent Couple Stress Theory (C-CST),
the new C-CDT is derived in a totally systematic manner. In this development,
the geometry of C-CDT is dual to the statics formulation in C-CST. Previously,
the fundamental step in the creation of C-CST was recognizing the
skew-symmetric character of the couple-stress tensor, which requires the
skew-symmetrical part of the bend-twist tensor to be the additional measure of
deformation in size-dependent continuum mechanics. Via Weingarten's theorem and
arguments from C-CST, we establish that in defect theory the dislocation
density tensor must be skew-symmetric and thus can be represented by an
equivalent dislocation density vector. In addition, we investigate the
character of a classical version of C-CDT with unexpected consequences. For
full consistency, there can be no continuous dislocation density tensor within
classical continuum mechanics, and the continuous disclination density tensor
becomes symmetric. This clearly is analogous to the absence of couple-stresses
and the symmetry of force-stresses in classical continuum mechanics.

decomposition can decompose the original time series of historical data into
relatively stationary components and long short-term memory network is able to
