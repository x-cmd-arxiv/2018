It should allow a comparatively simple minimization and simultaneously its
first order optimality condition should lead to multiplicative update rules,
which automatically preserve non-negativity of the iterates. We review the most
standard construction principles for surrogate functionals for Frobenius-norm

promising paradigm to enhance the data processing capability of low-power
networks, such as wireless sensor networks and internet of things (IoT). In
this paper, we consider a wireless powered MEC network that adopts a binary
offloading policy, so that each computation task of wireless devices (WDs) is
either executed locally or fully offloaded to an MEC server. Our goal is to
acquire an online algorithm that optimally adapts task offloading decisions and
wireless resource allocations to the time-varying wireless channel conditions.
This requires quickly solving hard combinatorial optimization problems within
the channel coherence time, which is hardly achievable with conventional
numerical optimization methods. To tackle this problem, we propose a Deep
Reinforcement learning-based Online Offloading (DROO) framework that implements
a deep neural network as a scalable solution that learns the binary offloading
decisions from the experience. It eliminates the need of solving combinatorial
optimization problems, and thus greatly reduces the computational complexity
especially in large-size networks. To further reduce the complexity, we propose
an adaptive procedure that automatically adjusts the parameters of the DROO
algorithm on the fly. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can
achieve near-optimal performance while significantly decreasing the computation
time by more than an order of magnitude compared with existing optimization
methods. For example, the CPU execution latency of DROO is less than $0.1$
second in a $30$-user network, making real-time and optimal offloading truly
viable even in a fast fading environment.

probabilistic embedding that results from projecting the curves to a randomly

locality-sensitive hashing. We show that in the worst case and under reasonable

complexity $t$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d\in\lbrace 2,3,4,5\rbrace$, degrades
by a factor linear in $t$ with constant probability. We show upper and lower
bounds on the distortion. We also evaluate our findings empirically on a
benchmark data set. The preliminary experimental results stand in stark
contrast with our lower bounds. They indicate that highly distorted projections
happen very rarely in practice, and only for strongly conditioned input curves.

However, these goals have turned out to be contradictory. Surface dominated
transport in topological insulators has been achieved primarily through
compensation doping of bulk carriers that introduces tremendous electronic
disorder and drastically deteriorates electronic coherence. In this work, we
use structural disorder instead of electronic disorder to manipulate electrical
properties of thin films of topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$. We achieve
decoupled surface state transport in our samples and observe significantly
suppressed carrier dephasing rates in the coupled surface state regime. As the
film thickness is decreased, the dephasing rate evolves from a linear to a
super-linear temperature dependence. While the former is consistent with
Nyquist electron-electron interactions, the latter leads to significantly
enhanced coherence at low temperatures and is indicative of energy exchange due
to frictional drag between the two surface states. Our work opens up the way to
harness topological surface states, without being afflicted by the deleterious

Many state of the art edge detection models are learned with fully

vulnerable to misaligned labels due to the delicate structure of edges. While
such problem was considered in evaluation benchmarks, similar issue has not
been explicitly addressed in general edge learning. In this paper, we show that

motivating application is exploration seismology where methods such as
Full-Waveform Inversion and Reverse-Time Migration are used to invert terabytes
of seismic data to create images of the earth's subsurface. Even using modern
supercomputers, it can take weeks to process a single seismic survey and create
a useful subsurface image. The computational cost is dominated by the numerical
solution of wave equations and their corresponding adjoints. Therefore, a great
deal of effort is invested in aggressively optimizing the performance of these
wave-equation propagators for different computer architectures. Additionally,
the actual set of partial differential equations being solved and their
numerical discretization is under constant innovation as increasingly realistic
representations of the physics are developed, further ratcheting up the cost of
practical solvers. By embedding a domain-specific language within Python and
making heavy use of SymPy, a symbolic mathematics library, we make it possible
to develop finite difference simulators quickly using a syntax that strongly
resembles the mathematics. The Devito compiler reads this code and applies a
wide range of analysis to generate highly optimized and parallel code. This
approach can reduce the development time of a verified and optimized solver

an important fundamental problem in turbulent multiphase flows. The problem is
relevant to many industrial applications and natural phenomena, such as
air-blast atomizers in fuel injection systems and breaking waves in the ocean.
The velocity difference between the gas and liquid streams triggers an
interfacial instability which can be convective or absolute depending on the
stream properties and injection parameters. In the present study, a direct
numerical simulation of a two-phase gas-liquid mixing layer that lie in the
absolute instability regime is conducted. A dominant frequency is observed in
the simulation and the numerical result agrees well with the prediction from
viscous stability theory. As the interfacial wave plays a critical role in
turbulence transition and development, the temporal evolution of turbulent
fluctuations (such as the enstrophy) also exhibits a similar frequency. In
order to investigate the statistical response of the multiphase turbulence
flow, the simulation has been run for a long physical time so that
time-averaging can be performed to yield the statistically converged results
for Reynolds stresses and the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budget. An
extensive mesh refinement study using from 8 million to about 4 billions cells
has been carried out. The turbulent dissipation is shown to be highly demanding
on mesh resolution compared to other terms in TKE budget. The results obtained
with the finest mesh are shown to be not far from converged results of
turbulent dissipation which allow us to obtain estimations of the Kolmogorov
and Hinze scales. The computed Hinze scale is significantly larger than the
size of droplets observed and does not seem to be a relevant length scale to
describe the smallest size of droplets formed in atomization.

  We present an abstract polymorphic effect system parameterized by an effect

the effects of a range of existing sequential effect systems. We define effect
quantales, derive useful properties, and show how they cleanly model a variety
of known sequential effect systems.
  We show that for most effect quantales, there is an induced notion of
iterating a sequential effect; that for systems we consider the derived
iteration agrees with the manually designed iteration operators in prior work;
and that this induced notion of iteration is as precise as possible when
defined. We also position effect quantales with respect to work on categorical
semantics for sequential effect systems, clarifying the distinctions between
these systems and our own in the course of giving a thorough survey of these
frameworks. Our derived iteration construct should generalize to these semantic

homogenize the abundances of the important absorbers CH$_4$ and CO much faster
than chemical reactions restore chemical equilibrium. This effect, typically
neglected in general circulation models (GCMs), has been suggested as
explanation for discrepancies between observed infrared lightcurves and those
predicted by GCMs: On the nightsides of several hot Jupiters, GCMs predict
outgoing fluxes that are too large, especially in the Spitzer 4.5 $\mu$m band.
We modified the SPARC/MITgcm to include disequilibrium abundances of CH$_4$, CO
and H$_2$O by assuming that the CH$_4$/CO ratio is constant throughout the
simulation domain. We ran simulations of hot Jupiter HD 189733b with 8
CH$_4$/CO ratios. In the more likely CO-dominated regime, we find temperature
changes $\geq$50-100 K compared to the equilibrium chemistry case across large
regions. This effect is large enough to affect predicted emission spectra and
should thus be included in GCMs of hot Jupiters with equilibrium temperatures
between 600K and 1300K. We find that spectra in regions with strong methane
absorption, including the Spitzer 3.6 and 8 $\mu$m bands, are strongly impacted
by disequilibrium abundances. We expect chemical quenching to result in much
larger nightside fluxes in the 3.6 $\mu$m band, in stark contrast to
observations. Meanwhile, we find almost no effect on predicted observations in
the 4.5 $\mu$m band, as the opacity changes due to CO and H$_2$O offset each
other. We thus conclude that disequilibrium carbon chemistry cannot explain the
observed low nightside fluxes in the 4.5 $\mu$m band.

electron-electron attraction can exhibit simultaneous magnetic and
superconducting order. Increasing the magnetic coupling weakens pairing and the
ground state loses superconductivity at a critical coupling. In the vicinity of
the critical coupling magnetic order dramatically modifies the quasiparticle
dispersion in the superconductor, creating low energy spectral weight and
significant gap anisotropy in the notional 's-wave' state. Using a Monte Carlo
approach to the Hubbard-Kondo lattice problem we establish a thermal phase
diagram, for varying magnetic coupling, that corresponds qualitatively to the
borocarbide superconductors. In addition to the superconducting and magnetic
transition temperatures, we identify two new thermal scales in this nominal
s-wave system. These are associated, respectively, with crossover from gapped
to gapless superconductivity, and from an anisotropic (nodal) 'Fermi surface'
at low temperature, through a Fermi arc regime, to an isotropic Fermi surface

base, i.e. a knowledge base containing information about the user. This paper
proposes an approach to extracting personal knowledge from smartphone push
notifications, which are used by mobile systems and apps to inform users of a
rich range of information. Our solution is based on the insight that most
notifications are formatted using templates, while knowledge entities can be
usually found within the parameters to the templates. As defining all the
notification templates and their semantic rules are impractical due to the huge
number of notification templates used by potentially millions of apps, we
propose an automated approach for personal knowledge extraction from push
notifications. We first discover notification templates through pattern mining,
then use machine learning to understand the template semantics. Based on the
templates and their semantics, we are able to translate notification text into
knowledge facts automatically. Users' privacy is preserved as we only need to
upload the templates to the server for model training, which do not contain any
personal information. According to our experiments with about 120 million push
notifications from 100,000 smartphone users, our system is able to extract
personal knowledge accurately and efficiently.

generalisation of skills or transitioning across fundamentally different
skills, it is unclear whether the robot has the necessary knowledge to perform
the task. Failing to detect missing information often leads to abrupt movements
or to collisions with the environment. Active learning can quantify the
uncertainty of performing the task and, in general, locate regions of missing
information. We introduce a novel algorithm for active learning and demonstrate
its utility for generating smooth trajectories. Our approach is based on deep
generative models and metric learning in latent spaces. It relies on the
Jacobian of the likelihood to detect non-smooth transitions in the latent
space, i.e., transitions that lead to abrupt changes in the movement of the
robot. When non-smooth transitions are detected, our algorithm asks for an
additional demonstration from that specific region. The newly acquired
knowledge modifies the data manifold and allows for learning a latent
representation for generating smooth movements. We demonstrate the efficacy of
our approach on generalising elementary skills, transitioning across different
skills, and implicitly avoiding collisions with the environment. For our
experiments, we use a simulated pendulum where we observe its motion from
images and a 7-DoF anthropomorphic arm.

to study fluid problems in recent years; but its computational cost can be high

based on SPH is developed for multiphase flow simulation. The numerical SPH
particles are refined or coarsened as needed, depending on the distance to the
interface. In developing the criteria, reference particle spacing is defined
for each particle, and it changes dynamically with the location of the
interface. A variable smoothing length is used together with adaptive
resolution. An improved algorithm for calculating the variable smoothing length
is further developed to reduce numerical errors. The proposed adaptive
resolution method is validated by five examples involving liquid drops impact
on dry or wet surfaces, water entry of a cylinder and dam break flow, with the
consideration of ambient gas. Different resolution levels are used in the
simulations. Numerical validations have proven that the present adaptive
resolution method can accurately capture the dynamics of liquid-gas interface
with low computational costs. The present adaptive method can be incorporated
into other SPH-based methods for efficient fluid dynamics simulation.

companion. For large mutual inclinations, the Lidov-Kozai mechanism secularly
excites large eccentricity and inclination oscillations of the inner binary.
The maximal eccentricity attained, $e_{\rm max}$ is simply derived and widely
used. However, for mildly hierarchical systems (i.e. the companion is
relatively close and massive), non-secular perturbations affect the evolution.
Here we account for fast non-secular variations and find new analytic formula
for $e_{{\rm max}}$, in terms of the system's hierarchy level, correcting
previous work and reproducing the orbital flip criteria. We find that $e_{{\rm
max}}$ is generally enhanced, allowing closer encounters between the inner
binary components, thus significantly changing their interaction and its final
outcome. We then extend our approach to include additional relativistic and
tidal forces. Using our results, we show that the merger time of
gravitational-wave (GW) sources orbiting massive black-holes in galactic nuclei
is enhanced compared with previous analysis accounting only for the secular
regime. Consequently, this affects the distribution and rates of such GW
sources in the relevant mild-hierarchy regime. We test and confirm our
predictions with direct N-body and 2.5-level Post-Newtonian codes. Finally, we
calculate the formation and disruption rates of hot-Jupiters (HJ) in planetary
systems using a statistical approach, which incorporates our novel results for
$e_{{\rm max}}$. We find that more HJ migrate from further out, but they are
also tidally disrupted more frequently. Remarkably, the overall formation rate
of HJs remains similar to that found in previous studies. Nevertheless, the
different rates could manifest in different underlying distribution of observed
warm-Jupiters.

simulations of frustrated quantum spin systems, focusing on spin S=1/2, two
spatial dimensions, and the extended Shastry-Sutherland model. We show that
formulating the Hamiltonian in the diagonal dimer basis leads to a sign problem
that becomes negligible at low temperatures for small and intermediate values
of the ratio of the inter- and intradimer couplings. This is a consequence of
the fact that the product state of dimer singlets is the exact ground state
both of the extended Shastry-Sutherland model and of a corresponding
""sign-problem-free"" model, obtained by changing the signs of all positive
off-diagonal matrix elements in the dimer basis. By exploiting this insight, we
map the sign problem throughout the extended parameter space from the
Shastry-Sutherland to the fully frustrated bilayer model and compare it with
the phase diagram computed by tensor-network methods. We use QMC to compute
with high accuracy the temperature dependence of the magnetic specific heat and
susceptibility of the Shastry-Sutherland model for large systems up to a
coupling ratio of 0.526(1) and down to zero temperature. For larger coupling
ratios, our QMC results assist us in benchmarking the evolution of the
thermodynamic properties by systematic comparison with exact diagonalization
calculations and interpolated high-temperature series expansions.

put strong constraints on this issue. We carefully selected a sample of
quiescent red sequence galaxies from SDSS. We bin them into three bins with
different [N II]/H{\alpha} and [N II]/[O II] ratios, and we measure the
temperature-sensitive [O III] {\lambda}4363, [N II] {\lambda}5755, [S II]
{\lambda}{\lambda}4068,4076, and [O II] {\lambda}{\lambda}7320,7330 lines in
the stacked spectra. The [S II] doublet ratios indicate the line-emitting gas
is in the low density regime (~10-100 cm$^{-3}$).We found the temperatures in
the S+ zones to be around 8000K, the temperatures in the O+ zones to be around
$1.1-1.5\times10^4$K, and the temperatures in the N+ zones to be around
$1-1.4\times10^4$K. The [O III] {\lambda}4363 line is not robustly detected. We
found that the extinction corrections derived from Balmer decrements would
yield unphysical relationships between the temperatures of the S+ zones and O+
zones, indicating that the extinction is significantly overestimated by the
measured Balmer decrements. We compared these line ratios with model
predictions for three ionization mechanisms: photoionization by hot evolved
stars, shocks, and turbulent mixing layers. For both the photoionization and
shock models, the hot temperatures inferred from [S II] and [N II]
coronal-to-strong line ratios require metallicities to be significantly
subsolar. However, the [N II]/[O II] line ratios require them to be supersolar.
None of the models could simultaneously explain all of the observed line

detail with particular focus on the outer disk. We treat the galactic disk as a
gravitationally coupled, three-component system consisting of stars, atomic
hydrogen gas, and molecular hydrogen gas in the gravitational field of the dark
matter halo. The self-consistent vertical distribution for stars and gas in
such a realistic system is obtained for radii between 4-22 kpc. The inclusion
of an additional gravitating component constrains the vertical stellar
distribution toward the mid-plane, so that the mid-plane density is higher, the
disk thickness is reduced, and the vertical density profile is steeper than in
the one-component, isothermal, stars-alone case. We show that the stellar
distribution is constrained mainly by the gravitational field of gas and dark
matter halo in the inner and the outer Galaxy, respectively. We find that the
thickness of the stellar disk (measured as the HWHM of the vertical density
distribution) increases with radius, flaring steeply beyond R=17 kpc. The disk
thickness is reduced by a factor of 3-4 in the outer Galaxy as a result of the
gravitational field of the halo, which may help the disk resist distortion at
large radii. The disk would flare even more if the effect of dark matter halo
were not taken into account. Thus it is crucially important to include the
effect of the dark matter halo when determining the vertical structure and
dynamics of a galactic disk in the outer region.

core of a cubelike graph, deducing a variety of structural, spectral and
group-theoretical properties that the core ""inherits"" from the host cubelike
graph. These properties constrain the structure of the core quite severely ---
even if the core of a cubelike graph is not actually cubelike, it must bear a
very close resemblance to a cubelike graph. Moreover we prove the much stronger
result that not only are these properties inherited by the core of a cubelike
graph, but also by the orbital graphs of the core. Even though the core and its
orbital graphs look very much like cubelike graphs, we are unable to show that
this is sufficient to characterise cubelike graphs. However, our results are
strong enough to eliminate all non-cubelike vertex-transitive graphs on up to
$32$ vertices as potential cores of cubelike graphs (of any size). Thus, if one

polarized light deforms the original butterfly while preserving the mirror
symmetry at flux $\phi=1/2$. We find the inversion symmetry is always preserved
for both linear and circular polarized light. For linearly polarized light, the
Hofstadter butterfly depends on the polarization direction. Further, we study
the effect of the laser on the Chern number of lowest band in the off-resonance
regime (laser frequency is larger than the bandwidth). For circularly polarized
light, we find that low laser intensity will not change the Chern number, but
beyond a critical intensity the Chern number will change. For linearly

transport with an ultracold atomic quantum gas. The setup makes use of the spin
control available in atomic systems to generate spin transport induced by an
impurity atom immersed in a spin-imbalanced two-component Fermi gas. In
contrast to solid-state realizations, in ultracold atoms spin relaxation and
the decoherence from external sources is largely suppressed. As a consequence,
once the spin current is turned off by manipulating the internal spin degrees
of freedom of the Fermi system, the nonequilibrium spin population remains
constant. Thus one can directly count the number of spins in each reservoir to
investigate the full counting statistics of spin flips, which is notoriously
challenging in solid state devices. Moreover, using Ramsey interferometry, the
dynamical impurity response can be measured. Since the impurity interacts with
a many-body environment that is out of equilibrium, our setup provides a way to
realize the non-equilibrium orthogonality catastrophe. Here, even for spin
reservoirs initially prepared in a zero-temperature state, the Ramsey response
exhibits an exponential decay, which is in contrast to the conventional
power-law decay of Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe. By mapping our system
to a multi-step Fermi sea, we are able to derive analytical expressions for the
impurity response at late times. This allows us to reveal an intimate
connection of the decay rate of the Ramsey contrast and the full counting
statistics of spin flips.

the TeV scale. We consider an effective description, with leptoquarks arising
as composite pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons, as well as anarchic partial
compositeness of the SM fermions. Considering the $R_K^{(*)}$ anomaly within
this framework, we study pair production of $S_3\sim(\bar 3,3)_{1/3}$ at the

predominantly into $t\tau$ and $b\nu$, and study the bounds from existing
searches at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV at the LHC. We find that sbottom searches in the
$b\bar{b}$+MET final state best explore the region in parameter space preferred
by our model and currently exclude $S_3^{1/3}$ masses up to $\sim$1 TeV.
Additional searches, considering the $t\tau$ and $t\mu$ decay modes, are
required to probe the full physical parameter space. In this paper we also
recast existing studies on direct leptoquark searches in the $t\tau t\tau$
channel and SM $t\bar{t}t\bar{t}$ searches, and obtain the regions in parameter
space currently excluded. Practically the whole physical parameter space is
currently excluded for masses up to $\sim$0.8 TeV, which could be extended up
to $\sim$1 TeV with the full Run 3 dataset. We conclude that pair production
searches for this leptoquark can benefit from considering the final state $t
\tau b$ +MET, where the largest branching ratio is expected. We appraise that
future explorations of leptoquarks explaining the B-anomalies with masses
beyond the TeV should also consider single and non-resonant production in order
to extend the mass reach.

are related via Fourier transforms and thus the properties are interwoven with
their structure. In particular, for lattice systems possessing an underlying
discrete position space, the momentum becomes finite. Moreover, if the lattice
length is finite, $L<\infty$, the momentum space also becomes both finite and
discrete breaking altogether the continuity of the dispersion relation. This
aspect is relevant in new systems such as the topological materials. We address
this point paving the path for new ways to the observation of Majorana
quasi-particles. Furthermore, the Kitaev model, which is the simplest
Hamiltonian supporting Majorana fermions, is therefore taken as a starting
point for the theoretical description of the work. Our study focuses on finding
the zero-energy modes in an artificial arrangement of a non-interacting
superconducting finite nanowire by using a discrete-sine transform with the
purpose of going from position to momentum space considering hard-wall boundary
conditions in the process. Here, a new $L$-dimensional Nambu operator to
diagonalize the system in the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism is proposed and,
further, we arrive to a new space with a considerable reduced dimension
allowing the treatment of larger system sizes.
  We also present a comparison between the numerical and third order
perturbation theory for the weak coupling regime results presenting an
excellent agreement. Finally, we analyze the wavefunctions of the retrieved
zero-energy modes showing that they are indeed edge states and thus they have
an exponential decay.

offers a set of fine-grained design primitives that capture the first
principles of data layout design: how data structure nodes lay data out, and
how they are positioned relative to each other. This allows for a structured
description of the universe of possible data structure designs that can be
synthesized as combinations of those primitives. The second innovation is
computation of performance using learned cost models. These models are trained
on diverse hardware and data profiles and capture the cost properties of
fundamental data access primitives (e.g., random access). With these models, we
synthesize the performance cost of complex operations on arbitrary data
structure designs without having to: 1) implement the data structure, 2) run
the workload, or even 3) access the target hardware. We demonstrate that the
Data Calculator can assist data structure designers and researchers by
accurately answering rich what-if design questions on the order of a few
seconds or minutes, i.e., computing how the performance (response time) of a
given data structure design is impacted by variations in the: 1) design, 2)
hardware, 3) data, and 4) query workloads. This makes it effortless to test
numerous designs and ideas before embarking on lengthy implementation,
deployment, and hardware acquisition steps. We also demonstrate that the Data

states derived from artificial neural networks (ANNs). Here, we propose and
investigate a new family of quantum states, coined generalized transfer matrix
states (GTMS), which bridges between the two mentioned approaches in the
framework of deep ANNs. In particular, we show by means of a constructive
embedding that the class of GTMS contains generic matrix product states while
at the same time being capable of capturing more long-ranged quantum
correlations that go beyond the area-law entanglement properties of tensor
networks. While the state amplitude of generic deep ANNs cannot be exactly
evaluated, that of a GTMS network can be analytically computed using transfer
matrix methods. With numerical simulations, we demonstrate how the GTMS network
learns random matrix product states in a supervised learning scheme, and how
augmenting the network by long-ranged couplings leads to the onset of
volume-law entanglement scaling. By means of an explicit example using
variational Monte Carlo, we also show that GTMS can parametrize critical
quantum many-body ground states to a good accuracy. Our findings suggest that
GTMS are a promising candidate for the study of critical and dynamical quantum
many-body systems.

1$), the forward problem for the stationary RTE is well approximated by an
elliptic equation. However, the connection between the inverse problem for the
RTE and the inverse problem for the elliptic equation has not been fully
developed. This problem is particularly interesting because the former one is
mildly ill-posed , with a Lipschitz type stability estimate, while the latter
is well known to be severely ill-posed with a logarithmic type stability
estimate. In this paper, we derive stability estimates for the inverse problem
for RTE and examine its dependence on $\mathsf{Kn}$. We show that the stability
is Lipschitz in all regimes, but the coefficient deteriorates as
$e^{\frac{1}{\mathsf{Kn}}}$, making the inverse problem of RTE severely
ill-posed when $\mathsf{Kn}$ is small. In this way we connect the two inverse
problems. Numerical results agree with the analysis of worsening stability as
the Knudsen number gets smaller.

enter the calculation of charges via Noether's second theorem, obstructing the
assignment of unambiguous physical charges to local gauge symmetries. Replacing
the arbitrary boundary choice with new degrees of freedom suggests itself. But,
concretely, such boundary degrees of freedom are spurious---i.e. they are not
part of the original field content of the theory---and have to disappear upon
gluing. How should we fit them into what we know about field-theory? We resolve
these issues in a unified and geometric manner, by introducing a connection
1-form, $\varpi$, in the field-space of Yang-Mills theory. Using this geometric
tool, a modified version of symplectic geometry---here called `horizontal'---is
possible. Independently of boundary conditions, this formalism bestows to each
region a physical notion of charge: the horizontal Noether charge. The
horizontal gauge charges always vanish, while global charges still arise for
reducible configurations characterized by global symmetries. The field-content
itself is used as a reference frame to distinguish `gauge' and `physical'; no
new degrees of freedom, such as group-valued edge modes, are required.
Different choices of reference fields give different $\varpi$'s, which are
cousins of gauge-fixing like the Higgs-unitary and Coulomb gauges. But the
formalism extends well beyond gauge-fixings, for instance by avoiding the
Gribov problem. For one choice of $\varpi$, would-be Goldstone modes arising
from the condensation of matter degrees of freedom play precisely the role of
the known group-valued edge modes, but here they arise as preferred coordinates
in field space, rather than new fields. For another choice, in the Abelian
case, $\varpi$ recovers the Dirac dressing of the electron.

for systems with general nonlinearities. First, the nonlinear model is lifted
to a model with more structure via variable transformations and the
introduction of auxiliary variables. The lifted model is equivalent to the
original model---it uses a change of variables, but introduces no
approximations. When discretized, the lifted model yields a polynomial system
of either ordinary differential equations or differential algebraic equations,
depending on the problem and lifting transformation. Proper orthogonal
decomposition (POD) is applied to the lifted models, yielding a reduced-order
model for which all reduced-order operators can be pre-computed. Thus, a key
benefit of the approach is that there is no need for additional approximations
of nonlinear terms, in contrast with existing nonlinear model reduction methods
requiring sparse sampling or hyper-reduction. Application of the lifting and
POD model reduction to the FitzHugh-Nagumo benchmark problem and to a tubular
reactor model with Arrhenius reaction terms shows that the approach is
competitive in terms of reduced model accuracy with state-of-the-art model
reduction via POD and discrete empirical interpolation, while having the added
benefits of opening new pathways for rigorous analysis and input-independent
model reduction via the introduction of the lifted problem structure.

  physical insights into ideal radiofrequency coil design","88 pages, 14 figures, 22 ancillary movies",,,,"physics.ins-det physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: Despite decades of collective experience, radiofrequency coil
optimization for MR has remained a largely empirical process, with clear
insight into what might constitute truly task-optimal, as opposed to merely
'good,' coil performance being difficult to come by. Here, a new principle, the
Optimality Principle, is introduced, which allows one to predict, rapidly and
intuitively, the form of optimal current patterns on any surface surrounding
any arbitrary body.
  Theory: The Optimality Principle, in its simplest form, states that the
surface current pattern associated with optimal transmit field or receive
sensitivity at a point of interest (per unit current integrated over the
surface) is a precise scaled replica of the tangential electric field pattern
that would be generated on the surface by a precessing spin placed at that
point. A more general perturbative formulation enables efficient calculation of
the pattern modifications required to optimize signal-to-noise ratio in
body-noise-dominated situations.
  Methods and Results: The unperturbed principle is validated numerically, and
convergence of the perturbative formulation is explored in simple geometries.
Current patterns and corresponding field patterns in a variety of concrete
cases are then used to separate signal and noise effects in coil optimization,
to understand the emergence of electric dipoles as strong performers at high
frequency, and to highlight the importance of surface geometry in coil design.
  Conclusion: Like the Principle of Reciprocity from which it is derived, the
Optimality Principle offers both a conceptual and a computational shortcut. In
addition to providing quantitative targets for coil design, the Optimality
Principle affords direct physical insight into the fundamental determinants of
coil performance.

shorter timescales (less than the current age of the Universe), the effect may
explain, at least partially, the observed lack of CBP of close-enough (with
periods < 5 days) stellar binaries; on longer timescales (greater than the age
of the Universe but well within stellar lifetimes), it may provide massive
liberation of chemically evolved CBP. Observational signatures of the effect
may comprise (1) a prevalence of large rocky planets (super-Earths) in the
whole population of rogue planets (if this mechanism were the only source of
rogue planets); (2) a mass-dependent paucity of CBP in systems of low-mass

models of errors incurred by approximate solutions to parameterized systems of

termination of an iterative method, a lower-fidelity model, or a
projection-based reduced-order model, for example. The proposed statistical
model comprises the sum of a deterministic regression-function model and a
stochastic noise model. The method constructs the regression-function model by
applying regression techniques from machine learning (e.g., support vector
regression, artificial neural networks) to map features (i.e., error indicators
such as sampled elements of the residual) to a prediction of the
approximate-solution error. The method constructs the noise model as a
mean-zero Gaussian random variable whose variance is computed as the sample
variance of the approximate-solution error on a test set; this variance can be
interpreted as the epistemic uncertainty introduced by the approximate
solution. This work considers a wide range of feature-engineering methods,
data-set-construction techniques, and regression techniques that aim to ensure
that (1) the features are cheaply computable, (2) the noise model exhibits low
variance (i.e., low epistemic uncertainty introduced), and (3) the regression
model generalizes to independent test data. Numerical experiments performed on
several computational-mechanics problems and types of approximate solutions
demonstrate the ability of the method to generate statistical models of the
error that satisfy these criteria and significantly outperform more commonly
adopted approaches for error modeling.

to a large body of work on static methods for conservatively predicting or

of Lee, Jones, and Ben-Amram, which operates in two phases: (1) abstract
programs into ""size-change graphs,"" and (2) check these graphs for the
size-change property: the existence of paths that lead to infinite decreasing
sequences.
  We transpose these two phases with an operational semantics that accounts for
the run-time enforcement of the size-change property, postponing (or entirely
avoiding) program abstraction. This choice has two key consequences: (1)
size-change termination can be checked at run-time and (2) termination can be
rephrased as a safety property analyzed using existing methods for systematic
abstraction.
  We formulate run-time size-change checks as contracts in the style of Findler
and Felleisen. The result compliments existing contracts that enforce partial
correctness specifications to obtain contracts for total correctness. Our
approach combines the robustness of the size-change principle for termination
with the precise information available at run-time. It has tunable overhead and
can check for nontermination without the conservativeness necessary in static
checking. To obtain a sound and computable termination analysis, we apply
existing abstract interpretation techniques directly to the operational
semantics, avoiding the need for custom abstractions for termination. The
resulting analyzer is competitive with with existing, purpose-built analyzers.

rechargeable batteries that use lithium metal as the negative electrode, and
thereby can safely access higher energy density than available with today's
lithium ion batteries. To do so, the solid electrolyte must be able to suppress
morphological instabilities that lead to poor coulombic efficiency and, in the
worst case, internal short circuits. In this work, lithium electrodeposition
experiments were performed using single-crystal Li6La3ZrTaO12 garnet as solid
electrolyte layers to investigate the factors that determine whether lithium
penetration occurs through brittle inorganic solid electrolytes. In these
single crystals, grain boundaries are excluded as possible paths for lithium
metal propagation. However, Vickers microindentation was used to introduce
sharp surface flaws of known size. Using operando optical microscopy, it was
found that lithium metal penetration sometimes initiates at these controlled
surface defects, and when multiple indents of varying size were present,
propagates preferentially from the largest defect. However, a second class of
flaws was found to be equally or more important. At the perimeter of surface
current collectors, an enhanced electrodeposition current density causes
lithium metal filled cracks to initiate and grow to penetration, even when the
large Vickers defects are in close proximity. Modeling the electric field
concentration for the experimental configurations, it was shown that a factor
of 5 enhancement in field can readily occur within 10 micrometers of current
collector discontinuities, which we interpret as the origin of
electrochemomechanical stresses leading to failure. Such field amplification
may determine the sites where supercritical surface defects dominate lithium
metal propagation during electrodeposition, overriding the presence of larger
defects elsewhere.

to low-pass filters that enforce (approximate) flow-conservation in the

a large extent focused on 2D materials both in their bulk form, as individual
layers a few atoms thick, and through stacking of 2D layers into
heterostructures. The identification of low-dimensional compounds is therefore
of key interest. Here, we perform a geometric analysis of material structures,
demonstrating a strong clustering of materials depending on their
dimensionalities. Based on the geometric analysis, we propose a simple scoring
parameter to identify materials of a particular dimension or of mixed
dimensionality. The method identifies spatially connected components of the
materials and gives a measure of the degree of ""1D-ness,"" ""2D-ness,"" etc., for
each component. The scoring parameter is applied to the Inorganic Crystal
Structure Database and the Crystallography Open Database ranking the materials
according to their degree of dimensionality. In the case of 2D materials the
scoring parameter is seen to clearly separate 2D from non-2D materials and the
parameter correlates well with the bonding strength in the layered materials.
About 3000 materials are identified as one-dimensional, while more than 9000
are mixed-dimensionality materials containing a molecular (0D) component. The
charge states of the components in selected highly ranked materials are
investigated using density functional theory and Bader analysis showing that
the spatially separated components have either zero charge, corresponding to
weak interactions, or integer charge, indicating ionic bonding.

(e.g., Carney-Latham sample), these studies did not correct for incompleteness.
In this study, we examine five different surveys and thoroughly account for
their underlying selection biases to measure the intrinsic occurrence rate of
close solar-type binaries. We re-analyze: (1) a volume-limited sample of
solar-type stars, (2) an SB survey of high-proper-motion stars, (3) various SB

Recently, the deep learning-based MRI reconstruction techniques were suggested
to accelerate MR image acquisition. The most common issues in any deep
learning-based MRI reconstruction approaches are generalizability and
transferability. For different MRI scanner configurations using these
approaches, the network must be trained from scratch every time with new
training dataset, acquired under new configurations, to be able to provide good
reconstruction performance. Here, we propose a new generalized parallel imaging
method based on deep neural networks called NLDpMRI to reduce any structured
aliasing ambiguities related to the different k-space undersampling patterns
for accelerated data acquisition. Two loss functions including non-regularized
and regularized are proposed for parallel MRI reconstruction using deep network
optimization and we reconstruct MR images by optimizing the proposed loss
functions over the network parameters. Unlike any deep learning-based MRI
reconstruction approaches, our method doesn't include any training step that
the network learns from a large number of training samples and it only needs
the single undersampled multi-coil k-space data for reconstruction. Also, the
proposed method can handle k-space data with different undersampling patterns,
and the different number of coils. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms the current state-of-the-art GRAPPA method and the deep

of information propagation traces, the genuine causal processes from temporal
correlation, i.e., homophily and other spurious causes. However, most studies
to characterize social influence, and, in general, most data-science analyses
focus on correlations, statistical independence, or conditional independence.
Only recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in ""causal data
science"", e.g., grounded on causality theories. In this paper we adopt a
principled causal approach to the analysis of social influence from
information-propagation data, rooted in the theory of probabilistic causation.
  Our approach consists of two phases. In the first one, in order to avoid the
pitfalls of misinterpreting causation when the data spans a mixture of several
subtypes (""Simpson's paradox""), we partition the set of propagation traces into
groups, in such a way that each group is as less contradictory as possible in
terms of the hierarchical structure of information propagation. To achieve this
goal, we borrow the notion of ""agony"" and define the Agony-bounded Partitioning
problem, which we prove being hard, and for which we develop two efficient
algorithms with approximation guarantees. In the second phase, for each group
from the first phase, we apply a constrained MLE approach to ultimately learn a
minimal causal topology. Experiments on synthetic data show that our method is
able to retrieve the genuine causal arcs w.r.t. a ground-truth generative
model. Experiments on real data show that, by focusing only on the extracted
causal structures instead of the whole social graph, the effectiveness of
predicting influence spread is significantly improved.

since many photos have only few, possibly ambiguous cues to their geolocation.
Recent work has cast this task as a classification problem by partitioning the
earth into a set of discrete cells that correspond to geographic regions. The
granularity of this partitioning presents a critical trade-off; using fewer but
larger cells results in lower location accuracy while using more but smaller
cells reduces the number of training examples per class and increases model
size, making the model prone to overfitting. To tackle this issue, we propose a
simple but effective algorithm, combinatorial partitioning, which generates a
large number of fine-grained output classes by intersecting multiple
coarse-grained partitionings of the earth. Each classifier votes for the
fine-grained classes that overlap with their respective coarse-grained ones.
This technique allows us to predict locations at a fine scale while maintaining

As a result, the classical correlation functions decay exponentially. In order
to investigate the influence of the classical chaotic behaviour on the
quantum-mechanical properties of the Artin system we calculated the
corresponding thermal quantum-mechanical correlation functions. It was
conjectured by Maldacena, Shenker and Stanford that the classical chaos can be
diagnosed in thermal quantum systems by using an out-of-time-order correlation
function as well as the square of the commutator of operators separated in
time. We demonstrated that the two- and four-point correlation functions of the
Louiville-like operators decay exponentially with a temperature dependent
exponent. As conjectured the square of the commutator of the Louiville-like
operators separated in time grows exponentially, similar to the exponential
divergency of trajectories in the classical regime. The corresponding exponent
does not saturate the maximal growth condition.

benefit from on-site or near-site data mining. In recent years, many smart
video surveillance approaches are proposed for object detection and tracking by
using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms.
However, it is still hard to migrate those computing and data-intensive tasks

envision to achieve intelligent surveillance as an edge service by proposing a
hybrid lightweight tracking algorithm named Kerman (Kernelized Kalman filter).
Kerman is a decision tree based hybrid Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF)
algorithm proposed for human object tracking, which is coupled with a
lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (L-CNN) for high performance. The
proposed Kerman algorithm has been implemented on a couple of single board

video streams. The experimental results are promising that the Kerman algorithm
is able to track the object of interest with a decent accuracy at a resource

CLASH X-ray-selected clusters that have high-quality weak- and strong-lensing
measurements from combined Subaru and {\em Hubble Space Telescope}
observations. The total density profiles derived from lensing are interpreted
based on the two-phase scenario of cluster formation. In this context, the
brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) forms in the first dissipative phase, followed
by a dissipationless phase where baryonic physics flattens the inner DM
distribution. This results in the formation of clusters with modified DM
distribution and several correlations between characteristic quantities of the
clusters. We find that the central DM density profiles of the clusters are
strongly influenced by baryonic physics as found in our earlier work. The inner
slope of the DM density for the CLASH clusters is found to be flatter than the
Navarro--Frenk--White profile, ranging from $\alpha=0.30$ to $0.79$. We examine
correlations of the DM density slope $\alpha$ with the effective radius

Phys. Rev. B {\bf 94}, 165138 (2016)]. In addition, vertex corrections are
calculated to be zero from the Ward identity. We find that pairing is possible
in non-zero angular momentum channels; the only differences are minor numerical
shifts. As before, the pairing leads to the gapped Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian
states. However, in our approximation scheme, pairing is not possible in the
putative particle-hole symmetric state for $\ell=0$ angular momentum. The
specific heat at low temperatures of a system of massless Dirac fermions
interacting with a transverse gauge field, expected to be relevant for the
half-filled Landau level, is calculated. Using the Luttinger formula, it is
found be $\propto T\ln T$ in the leading low temperature limit, due to the
exchange of transverse gauge bosons. The result agrees with the corresponding
one in the nonrelativistic composite fermion theory of Halperin, Lee and Read

Observations and models at different wavelengths suggest a central binary with
a 5.54 yr period residing in its core. 2D and 3D radiative transfer and
hydrodynamic simulations predict a primary with a dense and slow stellar wind
that interacts with the faster and lower density wind of the secondary. The
wind-wind collision scenario suggests that the secondary's wind penetrates the
primary's wind creating a low-density cavity in it, with dense walls where the
two winds interact. We aim to trace the inner ~5-50 au structure of Eta Car's
wind-wind interaction, as seen through BrG and, for the first time, through the
He I 2s-2p line. We have used spectro-interferometric observations with GRAVITY
at the VLTI. Our modeling of the continuum allows us to estimate its FWHM
angular size close to 2 mas and an elongation ratio of 1.06 +/- 0.05 over a PA
= 130 +/- 20 deg. Our CMFGEN modeling helped us to confirm that the role of the
secondary should be taken into account to properly reproduce the observed BrG
and He I lines. Chromatic images across BrG reveal a southeast arc-like
feature, possibly associated to the hot post-shocked winds flowing along the
cavity wall. The images of He I 2s-2p served to constrain the 20 mas structure
of the line-emitting region. The observed morphology of He I suggests that the
secondary is responsible for the ionized material that produces the line
profile. Both the BrG and the He I 2s-2p maps are consistent with previous
hydrodynamical models of the colliding wind scenario. Future dedicated
simulations together with an extensive interferometric campaign are necessary
to refine our constraints on the wind and stellar parameters of the binary,
which finally will help us predict the evolutionary path of Eta Car.

interstitial defects, we found that (N-As)$_{As}$ emerges as the lowest energy
configuration in comparison with (N-N)$_{As}$, agreeing with recent experiments
[T. Jen, et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 107, 221904 (2015)]. We also calculated the
levels induced in the electronic structure due to each of these defects: defect
states may occur as deep levels in the gap, shallow levels close to the band
edges, and as levels between bulk states. We find that the largest changes in
the band structure are produced by an isolated N atom in GaAs, which is
resonant with the conduction band, exhibiting a strong hybridization between N
and GaAs states. Deeper levels in the bandgap are obtained with (N-N)$_{As}$
split-interstitial defects. Our results confirm the formation of highly
localized states around the N sites, which is convenient for photovoltaics and
photoluminescence applications.

Belt orbital structure can provide clues and insight about the dynamical
history of the Solar System. The classical region of the Kuiper Belt has two
populations (the cold and hot populations) with completely different physical
and dynamical properties. These properties have been explained in the framework
of a subset of the simulations of the Nice Model, in which Neptune remained on
a low-eccentricity orbit (Neptune's eccentricity is never larger than 0.1)
throughout the giant planet instability. However, recent simulations have
showed that the remaining Nice model simulations, in which Neptune temporarily
acquires a large-eccentricity orbit (larger than 0.1), are also consistent with
the preservation of the cold population (inclination smaller than 4 degrees),
if the latter formed in situ. However, the resulting a cold population showed
in many of the simulations eccentricities larger than those observed for the
real population. We focus on a short period of time which is characterized by
Neptune's large eccentricity and a slow precession of Neptune's perihelion. We
show that if self-gravity is considered in the disk, the precession rate of the
particles longitude of perihelion is slowed down. This, combined with the
effect of mutual scattering among the bodies, which spreads all orbital
elements, allows some objects to return to low eccentricities. However, we show
that if the cold population originally had a small total mass, this effect is
negligible. Thus, we conclude that the only possibilities to keep at low
eccentricity some cold-population objects during a high-eccentricity phase of
Neptune are that (i) either Neptune's precession was rapid, as suggested by
Batygin et al. (2011) or (ii) Neptune's slow precession phase was long enough
to allow some particles to experience a full secular cycle.

vacuum state natural to the static charts as superpositions of the well-known
positive-frequency modes in the conformally-flat chart. We discuss in detail
how these modes are defined globally in the two static charts and the region in
their future. The global structure of these solutions leads to the well-known
description of the Bunch-Davies vacuum state as an entangled state. Our results
are expected to be useful not only for studying the thermal properties in the
vacuum fluctuations in de Sitter spacetime but also for understanding the
nonlocal properties of the vacuum state.

geometric structure but present variant local appearance and different pose.
Therefore, localizing and extracting discriminative local features play a
crucial role in accurate category prediction. Existing works either pay
attention to limited object parts or train isolated networks for locating and
classification. In this paper, we propose Weakly Supervised Bilinear Attention
Network (WS-BAN) to solve these issues. It jointly generates a set of attention
maps (region-of-interest maps) to indicate the locations of object's parts and
extracts sequential part features by Bilinear Attention Pooling (BAP). Besides,
we propose attention regularization and attention dropout to weakly supervise
the generating process of attention maps. WS-BAN can be trained end-to-end and
achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multiple fine-grained
classification datasets, including CUB-200-2011, Stanford Car and

point cloud registration algorithms that can achieve high performance in
difficult real-world situations where large pose displacement and
non-overlapping geometry would otherwise cause traditional methods to fail. Our
approach estimates overlapping regions through an iterative Expectation
Maximization procedure that encodes the sensor field-of-view into the
registration process. The proposed technique, Expected Overlap Estimation
(EOE), is derived from the observation that differences in field-of-view
violate the iid assumption implicitly held by all maximum likelihood based
registration techniques. We demonstrate how our approach can augment many
popular registration methods with minimal computational overhead. Through
experimentation on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we find that adding
an explicit overlap estimation step can aid robust outlier handling and
increase the accuracy of both ICP-based and GMM-based registration methods,
especially in large unstructured domains and where the amount of overlap
between point clouds is very small.

Design General Linear Model (VDGLM), a novel framework that facilitates the
detection of variance effects. We designed the framework for general use in any
fMRI study by modeling both mean and variance in BOLD activation as a function
of experimental design. The flexibility of this approach allows the VDGLM to i)
simultaneously make inferences about a mean or variance effect while
controlling for the other and ii) test for variance effects that could be
associated with multiple conditions and/or noise regressors. We demonstrate the
use of the VDGLM in a working memory application and show that engagement in a

so-called fictitious domain methods philosophy is proposed which avoids well
known shortcomings of other fictitious domain methods, including the need to
generate extensions of the data. The salient feature of the novel method, which
we refer to as SSEM (Smooth Selection Embedding Method), is that it reduces the
whole boundary value problem to a linear constraint for an appropriate
optimization problem formulated in a larger simpler set containing the domain
on which the boundary value problem is posed and which allows for the use of
straightforward discretizations. The proposed method in essence computes a
(discrete) extension of the solution to the boundary value problem by selecting
it as a smooth element of the complete affine family of solutions of the
extended, yet unmodified, under-determined problem. The actual regularity of
this extension is determined by that of the analytic solution and the choice of
obejctive functional. Numerical experiments will demonstrate that it can be
stably used to efficiently deal with non-constant coefficients, general
geometries, and different boundary conditions in dimensions d=1,2,3 and that it
produces solutions of tunable (and high) accuracy.

the early Universe, and although anomolous subclasses of EMP stars such as
carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars are well-studied, they make up less
than half of all EMP stars with [Fe/H] $\sim -3.0$. The amount of carbon
depletion occurring on the red giant branch (carbon offset) is used to
determine the evolutionary status of EMP stars, and this offset will differ
between CEMP and normal EMP stars. The depletion mechanism employed in stellar
models (from which carbon offfsets are derived) is very important, however the
only widely available carbon offsets in the literature are derived from stellar
models using a thermohaline mixing mechanism that cannot simultaneously match
carbon and lithium abundances to observations for a single diffusion
coeffcient. Our stellar evolution models utilise a modified thermohaline mixing
model that can match carbon and lithium in the metal-poor globular cluster NGC
6397. We compare our models to the bulk of the EMP star sample at [Fe/H] $= -3$
and show that our modified models follow the trend of the observations and
deplete less carbon compared to the standard thermohaline mixing theory. We
conclude that stellar models that employ the standard thermohaline mixing
formalism overestimate carbon offsets and hence CEMP star frequencies,
particularly at metallicities where carbon-normal stars dominate the EMP star
population.

vicinity of the $J/\psi$ resonance with the BESIII detector and with a total
integrated luminosity of around 100 pb$^{-1}$, we study the relative phase
between the strong and electromagnetic amplitudes of $J/\psi$ decays. The
relative phase between $J\psi$ electromagnetic decay and the continuum process
($e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation without the $J/\psi$ resonance) is confirmed to be
zero by studying the cross section lineshape of $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ production.
The relative phase between $J/\psi$ strong and electromagnetic decays is then
measured to be $(84.9\pm3.6)^\circ$ or $(-84.7\pm3.1)^\circ$ for the
$2(\pi^{+}\pi^{-})\pi^{0}$ final state by investigating the interference
pattern between the $J/\psi$ decay and the continuum process. This is the first
measurement of the relative phase between $J/\psi$ strong and electromagnetic
decays into a multihadron final state using the lineshape of the production
cross section. We also study the production lineshape of the multihadron final
state $\eta\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ with $\eta\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{0}$, which provides
additional information about the phase between the $J/\psi$ electromagnetic
decay amplitude and the continuum process. Additionally, the branching fraction
of $J/\psi\to 2(\pi^{+}\pi^{-})\pi^{0}$ is measured to be $(4.73\pm0.44)\%$ or
$(4.85\pm0.45)\%$, and the branching fraction of $J/\psi\to\eta\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$
is measured to be $(3.78\pm0.68)\times10^{-4}$. Both of them are consistent
with the world average values. The quoted uncertainties include both

While the irregular
shapes of large asteroids may be attributed to collisional events, those of
small asteroids may result from not only impact events but also rotationally
induced failure, a long-term consequence of small torques caused by, for
example, solar radiation pressure. A better understanding of shape deformation
induced by such small torques will allow us to give constraints on the
evolution process of an asteroid and its structure. However, no quantitative
study has been reported to provide the relationship between an asteroid's shape
and its failure mode due to its fast rotation. Here, we use a finite element
model (FEM) technique to analyze the failure modes and conditions of 24
asteroids with diameters less than 30 - 40 km, which were observed at high
resolution by ground radar or asteroid exploration missions. Assuming that the
material distribution is uniform, we investigate how these asteroids fail
structurally at different spin rates. Our FEM simulations describe the detailed
deformation mode of each irregularly shaped asteroid at fast spin. The failed
regions depend on the original shape. Spheroidal objects structurally fail from
the interior, while elongated objects experience structural failure on planes
perpendicular to the minimum moment of inertia axes in the middle of their
structure. Contact binary objects have structural failure across their most
sensitive cross sections. We further investigate if our FEM analysis is
consistent with earlier works that theoretically explored a uniformly rotating
triaxial ellipsoid. The results show that global shape variations may
significantly change the failure condition of an asteroid. Our work suggests
that it is critical to take into account the actual shapes of asteroids to
explore their failure modes in detail.

convergence rate per data access is to always choose batch size of 1, which is
equivalent to the SAGA algorithm. However, due to the presence of cache/disk IO

running time because of 1) random memory access is much slower than sequential
access, 2) when data is too big to fit into memory, disk seeking takes even
longer time. After taking these into account, choosing batch size of $1$ is no
longer optimal, so we propose a new algorithm called SAGA++ and show how to

establish this statement by proving that a metric space which is
$q$-barycentric for some $q\in [1,\infty)$ has metric cotype $q$ with sharp
scaling parameter. Our proof utilizes nonlinear (metric space-valued)
martingale inequalities and yields sharp bounds even for some classical Banach

$\ell_\infty$ grid $[m]_\infty^n=(\{1,\ldots,m\}^n,\|\cdot\|_\infty)$ into
$\ell_q$ for all $q\in (2,\infty)$, from which we deduce the following discrete
converse to the fact that $\ell_\infty^n$ embeds with distortion $O(1)$ into
$\ell_q$ for $q=O(\log n)$. A rigidity theorem of Ribe (1976) implies that for
every $n\in \mathbb{N}$ there exists $m\in \mathbb{N}$ such that if
$[m]_\infty^n$ embeds into $\ell_q$ with distortion $O(1)$, then $q$ is
necessarily at least a universal constant multiple of $\log n$. Ribe's theorem
does not give an explicit upper bound on this $m$, but by the work of Bourgain
(1987) it suffices to take $m=n$, and this was the previously best-known
estimate for $m$. We show that the above discretization statement actually

Most existing algorithms are optimally designed under the assumption. However,
for many real-world applications, the observed positive examples are dependent

this paper, we assume that a positive example with a higher $P(Y = 1|X)$ is
more likely to be labelled and propose a probabilistic-gap based PU learning

iterative sessions to search innovative ideas in a common problem landscape.
Each agent has one base idea stored in its individual memory, and one social
idea fed by a round-table group support mechanism in each session. The idea
combination and improvement processes are respectively realized by using a
recombination search (XS) strategy and a local search (LS) strategy, to build
on the base and social ideas. RTGO is then implemented for solving two
difficult sequencing problems, i.e., the flowshop scheduling problem and the
quadratic assignment problem. The domain-specific LS strategies are adopted
from existing algorithms, whereas a general XS class, called socially biased
combination (SBX), is realized in a modular form. The performance of RTGO is
then evaluated on commonly-used benchmark datasets. Good performance on
different problems can be achieved by RTGO using appropriate SBX operators.
Furthermore, RTGO is able to outperform some existing methods, including
methods using the same LS strategies.

subject to numerous deleterious atmospheric effects. Beam-shaping diffusers are
emerging as a low-cost technology to achieve hitherto unachievable differential
photometric precisions from the ground. These diffusers mold the focal plane
image of a star into a broad and stable top-hat shape, minimizing photometric
errors due to non-uniform pixel response, atmospheric seeing effects, imperfect
guiding, and telescope-induced variable aberrations seen in defocusing. In this
paper, we expand on our previous work (Stefansson et al. 2017; Stefansson et

guidelines when sizing a diffuser for use on a telescope. Furthermore, we
present our open source Python package iDiffuse which can calculate the
expected PSF size of a diffuser in a telescope system, along with its expected
on-sky diffuser-assisted photometric precision for a host star of a given

the ground. Although iDiffuse has primarily been developed to plan challenging
transit observations using the diffuser on the ARCTIC imager on the ARC 3.5m

extended to calculate the expected diffuser-assisted photometric precisions on

articulated heavy-duty vehicles due to their poor manoeuvrability, large sizes
and mass variation. In addition, uncertainties on mass may have the potential
to significantly decrease the performance of the system, even to the point of
destabilising it. These parametric variations must be taken into account during
the design of the controller. However, robust control techniques usually
require offline adjustment of auxiliary tuning parameters, which is not
practical, leading to sub-optimal operation. Hence, this paper presents an
approach to path-following and lateral control for autonomous articulated
heavy-duty vehicles subject to parametric uncertainties by using a robust
recursive regulator. The main advantage of the proposed controller is that it
does not depend on the offline adjustment of tuning parameters. Parametric
uncertainties were assumed to be on the payload, and an $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$
controller was used for performance comparison. The performance of both
controllers is evaluated in a double lane-change manoeuvre. Simulation results
showed that the proposed method had better performance in terms of robustness,
lateral stability, driving smoothness and safety, which demonstrates that it is
a very promising control technique for practical applications.

our model accurately predicted the national PM2.5 with a R2 at 70% and

from the two different points of views: identification of vulnerabilities, and
mitigation of privacy risks. Recent research has shown the vulnerability of
user-generated data against the two general types of attacks, identity

data publishers to protect users' privacy by sanitizing user-generated data

proposed to anonymize user-generated social media data. There is a vast
literature on privacy of users in social media from many perspectives. In this

tasks: human pose estimation and face alignment. The results show that our

molecular cell biology. A particularly important example is single molecule
tracking which enables the study of the motion of a molecule in cellular

individual molecules in cellular environments, which were not available before
through bulk studies. Here, we consider a dynamical system where the motion of
an object is modeled by stochastic differential equations (SDEs), and
measurements are the detected photons emitted by the moving fluorescently
labeled object, which occur at discrete time points, corresponding to the
arrival times of a Poisson process, in contrast to uniform time points which
have been commonly used in similar dynamical systems. The measurements are
distributed according to optical diffraction theory, and therefore, they would
be modeled by different distributions, e.g., a Born and Wolf profile for an
out-of-focus molecule. For some special circumstances, Gaussian image models
have been proposed. In this paper, we introduce a stochastic framework in which
we calculate the maximum likelihood estimates of the biophysical parameters of
the molecular interactions, e.g., diffusion and drift coefficients. More
importantly, we develop a general framework to calculate the Cram\'er-Rao lower
bound (CRLB), given by the inverse of the Fisher information matrix, for the
estimation of unknown parameters and use it as a benchmark in the evaluation of
the standard deviation of the estimates. There exists no established method,
even for Gaussian measurements, to systematically calculate the CRLB for the
general motion model that we consider in this paper. We apply the developed
methodology to simulated data of a molecule with linear trajectories and show
that the standard deviation of the estimates matches well with the square root

distribution in core radii separating the so-called ""core-collapsed"" and
""non-core-collapsed"" clusters. Here, we use our H\'enon-type Monte Carlo code,
CMC, to explore initial cluster parameters that map into this bimodality.
Remarkably, we find that by varying the initial size of clusters (specified in
our initial conditions in terms of the initial virial radius, $r_v$) within a
relatively narrow range consistent with the measured radii of young star
clusters in the local universe ($r_v \approx 0.5-5$ pc), our models reproduce
the variety of present-day cluster properties. Furthermore, we show that
stellar-mass black holes (BHs) play an intimate role in this mapping from
initial conditions to the present-day structural features of GCs. We identify
""best-fit"" models for three GCs with known observed BH candidates, NGC 3201,
M22, and M10, and show that these clusters harbor populations of $\sim 50-100$
stellar-mass BHs at present. As an alternative case, we also compare our models
to the core-collapsed cluster NGC 6752 and show that this cluster likely
contains few BHs at present. Additionally, we explore the formation of BH
binaries in GCs and demonstrate that these systems form naturally in our models
in both detached and mass-transferring configurations with a variety of
companion stellar types, including low-mass main sequence stars, white dwarfs,
and sub-subgiants.

because of the huge training overhead associated with acquiring the channel
knowledge or designing the narrow beams. Current mmWave beam training and
channel estimation techniques do not normally make use of the prior beam
training or channel estimation observations. Intuitively, though, the channel
matrices are functions of the various elements of the environment. Learning
these functions can dramatically reduce the training overhead needed to obtain
the channel knowledge. In this paper, a novel solution that exploits machine
learning tools, namely conditional generative adversarial networks (GAN), is
developed to learn these functions between the environment and the channel
covariance matrices. More specifically, the proposed machine learning model
treats the covariance matrices as 2D images and learns the mapping function
relating the uplink received pilots, which act as RF signatures of the
environment, and these images. Simulation results show that the developed
strategy efficiently predicts the covariance matrices of the large-dimensional
mmWave channels with negligible training overhead.

scenario when packets are injected continuously by an adversary to the buffers
of the devices at rate $\rho$ packages per round. The aim is to maintain system
stability, that is, bounded queues. In contrast to previous work we assume that
there is a strict limit of available power, defined as the total number of
stations allowed to transmit or listen to the channel at a given time, that can
never be exceeded. We study how this constraint influences the quality of
services with particular focus on stability. We show that in the regime of
deterministic algorithms, the significance of energy restriction depends
strongly on communication capabilities of broadcasting protocols. For the
adaptive and full-sensing protocols, wherein stations may substantially adopt
their behavior to the injection pattern, one can construct efficient algorithms
using very small amounts of power without sacrificing throughput or stability
of the system. In particular, we construct constant-energy adaptive and full
sensing protocols stable for $\rho=1$ and any $\rho<1$, respectively, even for
worst case (adversarial) injection patterns. Surprisingly, for the case of
acknowledgment based algorithms that cannot adopt to the situation on the
channel (i.e., their transmitting pattern is fixed in advance), limiting power
leads to reducing the throughput. That is, for this class of protocols in order
to preserve stability we need to reduce injection rate significantly. We
support our theoretical analysis by simulation results of algorithms
constructed in the paper. We depict how they work for systems of moderate,
realistic sizes. We also provide a comprehensive simulation to compare our
algorithms with backoff algorithms, which are common in real-world
implementations, in terms of queue sizes and energy consumption.

readily detected at (sub)mm wavelengths in many disks. Inferred gas masses from
CO in recent ALMA observations of large samples of disks seem inconsistent with
their inferred dust masses. The derived gas-to-dust mass ratios from CO are 1-2
orders of magnitude lower than $\sim$100 even if photodissociation and
freeze-out are included. Herschel measurements of HD line emission imply gas
masses in line with gas-to-dust mass ratios of 100. This suggests that at least
one additional mechanism is removing gaseous CO. Here we test the suggestion
that the bulk of the CO is chemically processed and that the carbon is
sequestered into less volatile species such as CO2, CH3OH and CH4 in the dense,
shielded midplane regions of the disk. Using our gas-grain chemical code we
perform a parameter exploration and follow the CO abundance evolution over a
range of conditions representative of shielded disk midplanes. We find that no
chemical processing of CO takes place on 1-3 Myr timescales for low cosmic-ray
ionisation rates, $< 5\times 10^{-18}$ s$^{-1}$. Assuming an ionisation rate of
$10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$, more than 90% of the CO is destroyed, but only in the
parts of the disk below 30 K. This order of magnitude destruction of CO is
robust against the choice of grain-surface reaction rate parameters except for
temperatures below 20 K, where there is a strong dependence on the H tunnelling
barrier. The low temperatures needed for CO chemical processing indicate that
the exact disk temperature structure is important, with warm disks around
luminous Herbig stars expected to have little to no CO conversion. For cold
disks around T Tauri stars, a large fraction of the emitting CO layer is
affected unless the disks are young (< 1 Myr). This can lead to inferred gas
masses that are up to two orders of magnitude too low.

these deceptive observed light curves are interference of two real constant
period light curves of long-lived starspots. The slow motion of these
long-lived starspots with respect to each other causes the observed light curve
changes. This hypothesis contradicts the current views of starspots. Therefore,
we subject it to eight reproducible tests. Our new period finding method
detects the two real light curves of FK Com. Our hypothesis is a total success:
all real light curve parameters are directly connected to the long-lived
starspots which are also seen in the Doppler images of FK Com.These parameters
are spatially and temporally correlated just like in the Sun, including weak
solar-like surface differential rotation. As for other chromospherically active
stars, all eight reproducible tests also support our hypothesis. It explains
many spurious phenomena: the rapid light curve changes, the short starspot
life-times, the rapid rotation period changes, the active longitudes, the
starspot migration, the period cycles, the amplitude cycles and the minimum
epoch cycles. It also explains why the light curves and the Doppler images give
contradicting surface differential rotation estimates even for the same
individual star, as well as the abrupt 180 degrees shifts of activity (the
flip-flop events) and the long-term mean light curves. We argue that the
current views of starspots need to be revised.

We have estimated, for the first time, the neutrino fluxes of Type I bursts for
a range of initial conditions based on the predictions of a 1D implicit
hydrodynamics code, KEPLER, which calculates the complete nuclear reaction
network. We find that neutrino losses are between $6.7 \times 10^{-5}$ and
$0.14$ of the total energy per nucleon, Q$_{nuc}$, depending upon the hydrogen
fraction in the fuel. These values are significantly below the $35\,\%$ value
for neutrino losses often adopted in recent literature for the rp-process. The
discrepancy arises because it is only at $\beta$-decays that $\approx35\,\%$ of
energy is lost due to neutrino emission, whereas there are no neutrino losses
in $(p,\gamma)$ and $(\alpha,p)$ reactions. Using the total measured burst
energies from KEPLER for a range of initial conditions, we have determined an

two objectives, introduced recently to give insight into the performance of
average-linkage clustering: a similarity based HC objective proposed by

[Cohen-Addad et al., 2018]. In both cases, we present tight counterexamples
showing that average-linkage cannot obtain better than 1/3 and 2/3

raised in [Moseley and Wang, 2017]. This matches the approximation ratio of a
random solution, raising a natural question: can we beat average-linkage for
these objectives? We answer this in the affirmative, giving two new algorithms

various properties of biological samples, through multi-task and transfer
learning. It encodes the whole transcription profile into a strikingly
low-dimensional latent vector of size 8, and then recovers mRNA and miRNA
expression profiles, tissue and disease type from this vector. This latent
space is significantly better than the original gene expression profiles for
discriminating samples based on their tissue and disease. We employed this
architecture on mRNA transcription profiles of 10787 clinical samples from 34
classes (one healthy and 33 different types of cancer) from 27 tissues. Our
method significantly outperforms prior works and classical machine learning
approaches in predicting tissue-of-origin, normal or disease state and cancer
type of each sample. For tissues with more than one type of cancer, it reaches
99.4\% accuracy in identifying the correct cancer subtype. We also show this

gradient descent (GD), especially for large data sets, by dividing the
computation tasks into smaller subtasks and assigning to different computing
servers (CSs) to be executed in parallel. In standard parallel execution,
per-iteration waiting time is limited by the execution time of the straggling
servers. Coded DGD techniques have been introduced recently, which can tolerate
straggling servers via assigning redundant computation tasks to the CSs. In
most of the existing DGD schemes, either with coded computation or coded
communication, the non-straggling CSs transmit one message per iteration once
they complete all their assigned computation tasks. However, although the
straggling servers cannot complete all their assigned tasks, they are often
able to complete a certain portion of them. In this paper, we allow multiple
transmissions from each CS at each iteration in order to make sure a maximum
number of completed computations can be reported to the aggregating server
(AS), including the straggling servers. We numerically show that the average
completion time per iteration can be reduced significantly by slightly
increasing the communication load per server.

during the winter on the upper continental slope of the northern South China
Sea were reported in Yang et al. (2009), but their generation mechanism remains
elusive. We investigated this issue with a multi-modal evolution model and
theoretical analysis, which suggest that the observed mode-2 ISWs were
generated by a shoaling mode-2 semidiurnal internal tide (IT) that emanated
from the Luzon Strait. The results show that two groups of mode-2 ISWs usually
appear within one semidiurnal tidal period, successively riding on expanded and
subsequently compressed pycnoclines. The number of wave groups largely depends
on the amplitudes of the ITs; that is, a larger IT produces larger mode-2 ISWs.
Furthermore, intermodal coupling dominates the evolution of a mode-1 IT,
highlighting the importance of considering mode scattering in the propagation
of low-mode ITs.

model accounting for intermodal interaction is derived based on a multi-modal
approach in a weakly nonlinear and non-hydrostatic configuration. The
generation model is numerically solved to simulate the evolution of mode-1 and
mode-2 IWs in an inhomogeneous pycnocline. The numerical experiments confirm
that a mode-2 IW is generated due to linear and nonlinear intermodal
interaction. The mode-2 IW continues growing and gradually separates with the
mode-1 IW during the generation process. A non-dimensional quantity quantifying
the energy of mode-2 IWs is used to investigate the favorable conditions for
the formation of mode-2 IWs. The numerical results suggest that the pycnocline
strength or depth prominently affects the formation of mode-2 IWs, followed by
pycnocline thickness. A weakening or shoaling pycnocline favors the formation
of mode-2 IWs by evidently enhancing linear and nonlinear intermodal
interaction, whereas a thinning pycnocline favors the process mainly by
enhancing nonlinear intermodal interaction. Shortening the front length
inhibits nonlinear intermodal interaction while equivalently strengthens the
linear intermodal interaction. Increasing the initial mode-1 IW amplitude can
noticeably increase the produced mode-2 IW amplitude.

shifted conventional static capacity planning solutions to complex

Therefore, a continuous monitoring of system attributes and performance metrics

the application. Data analytic methods such as statistical and machine learning
approaches offer the required concepts, models and tools to dig into the data,
find general rules, patterns and characteristics that define the functionality

out about the changes in the workloads, faulty components or problems that can
cause system performance to degrade. A timely reaction to performance
degradations can avoid violations of the service level agreements by performing
proper corrective actions including auto-scaling or other resource adjustment

frequency, we will localize the representation of the signals in terms of the

technical level, since there is no proper analogue of Beurling's extremal

combination of an argument similar to Schur's test with an extension of Seip's
local reproducing formula to general Hermite windows. When the windows are
Hermite functions, we obtain local reproducing formulas for polyanalytic Fock
spaces which lead to explicit large sieve constant estimates and, as a
byproduct, to a reconstruction formula for $f\in L^{2}(\mathbb{R})$ from its
STFT values on arbitrary discs. A discussion on optimality follows, along the

also consider the case of discrete Gabor systems, vector-valued STFT transforms

either a high dynamic range or a high sensitivity, and they are subject to a
linear trade off between these two parameters. A new class of wavefront
sensors, the Generalised Optical Differentiation Wavefront Sensors, has been
devised, in a way not to undergo this linear trade off and to decouple the
dynamic range from the sensitivity. This new class of WFSs is based on the
light filtering in the focal plane from a dedicated amplitude filter, which is
a hybrid between a linear filter, whose physical dimension is related to the
dynamic range, and a step in the amplitude, whose size is related to the
sensitivity. We propose here a possible technical implementation of this kind
of WFS, making use of a simple holographic diffuser to diffract part of the
light in a ring shape around the pin of a pyramid wavefront sensor. In this
way, the undiffracted light reaches the pin of the pyramid, contributing to the
high sensitivity regime of the WFS, while the diffused light is giving a sort
of static modulation of the pyramid, allowing to have some signal even in high
turbulence conditions. The holographic diffuser zeroth order efficiency is
strictly related to the sensitivity of the WFS, while the diffusing angle of
the diffracted light gives the amount of modulation and thus the dynamic range.
By properly choosing these two parameters it is possible to build a WFS with
high sensitivity and high dynamic range in a static fashion. Introducing
dynamic parts in the setup allows to have a set of different diffuser that can
be alternated in front of the pyramid, if the change in the seeing conditions
requires it.

computer vision. A comprehensive evaluation of feature matchers is necessary,
since it would advance both the development of this field and also high-level
applications such as Structure-from-Motion or Visual SLAM. However, to the best
of our knowledge, no previous work targets the evaluation of feature matchers
while they only focus on evaluating feature detectors and descriptors. This
leads to a critical absence in this field that there is no standard datasets
and evaluation metrics to evaluate different feature matchers fairly. To this
end, we present the first uniform feature matching benchmark to facilitate the
evaluation of feature matchers. In the proposed benchmark, matchers are
evaluated in different aspects, involving matching ability, correspondence
sufficiency, and efficiency. Also, their performances are investigated in
different scenes and in different matching types. Subsequently, we carry out an
extensive evaluation of different state-of-the-art matchers on the benchmark
and make in-depth analyses based on the reported results. This can be used to
design practical matching systems in real applications and also advocates the
potential future research directions in the field of feature matching.

HgTe quantum wells in the presence of a large parallel magnetic field up to 33
T is applied. We show that in quantum wells with inverted band structure a
monotonically decreasing magnetoresistance is observed when a magnetic field up
to order 10 T is applied parallel to the quantum well plane. This feature is
accompanied by a vanishing of non-locality and is consistent with a predicted
modification of the energy spectrum that becomes gapless at a critical in-plane
field $B_{c}$. Magnetic fields in excess of $B_c$ allow us to investigate the
evolution of the magnetoresistance in this field-induced semi-metallic region
beyond the known regime. After an initial saturation phase in the presumably
gapless phase, we observe a strong upturn of the longitudinal resistance. A
small residual Hall signal picked up in non-local measurements suggests that
this feature is likely a bulk phenomenon and caused by the semi-metallicity of
the sample. Theoretical calculations indeed support that the origin of these
features is classical and a power law upturn of the resistance can be expected
due to the specifics of two-carrier transport in thin (semi-)metallic samples
subjected to large magnetic fields.

furthermore that these magnetic components are exchange-coupled when aluminium

public random variable based on noisy measurements which contain private
information. The public random variable carries non-private information,
however, its estimate will be correlated with the private information due to
the estimation process. It is assumed that the estimate of the public random
variable is revealed to an untrusted party. The objective is to design an
estimator for the public random variable such that the leakage of the private
information, via the estimation process, is kept below a certain level. The
privacy metric is defined as the discrete conditional entropy of the private
random variable, which carries the private information, given the output of the
estimator. A binary loss function is considered for the estimation of the
public random variable. It is shown that the optimal privacy-aware estimator is
the solution of a (possibly infinite-dimensional) convex optimization problem.
We next study the optimal perfect privacy estimator which ensures that the
estimate of the public random variable is independent of the private
information. A necessary and sufficient condition is derived which guarantees
that an estimator satisfies the perfect privacy requirement. It is shown that
the optimal perfect privacy estimator is the solution of a linear optimization
problem. A sufficient condition for the existence of the optimal perfect
privacy estimator is derived when the estimator has access to discretized
measurements of sensors.

filament. This event was observed in H-alpha with GONG and CLIMSO, and in
ultraviolet (UV) with the AIA/SDO imager. The aim of the paper is to relate the
photospheric motions below the filament and its environment to the eruption of
the filament. An analysis of the photospheric motions using SDO/HMI continuum
images with the coherent structure tracking (CST) algorithm developed to track
granules, as well as large-scale photospheric flows, has been performed. The
supergranule pattern is clearly visible outside the filament channel but
difficult to detect inside because the modulus of the vector velocity is
reduced in the filament channel, mainly in the magnetized areas. The horizontal
photospheric flows are strong on the west side of the filament channel and
oriented towards the filament. The ends of the filament sections are found in
areas of concentration of corks. Whirled flows are found locally around the
feet. The strong horizontal flows with an opposite direction to the
differential rotation create strong shear and convergence along the magnetic
polarity inversion line (PIL) in the filament channel. The filament has been
destabilized by the converging flows, which initiate an ascent of the middle
section of the filament until the filament reaches the critical height of the
torus instability inducing, consequently, the eruption. The ""n"" decay index
indicated an altitude of 60 Mm for the critical height. It is conjectured that
the convergence along the PIL is due to the large-scale size cells of
convection that transport the magnetic field to their borders.

heavy-fermion compounds are contrasted with regards to the interplay between
antiferromagnetic (AF) quantum criticality and superconductivity. For
CeCu$_2$Si$_2$, fully-gapped d-wave superconductivity forms in the vicinity of
an itinerant three-dimensional heavy-fermion spin-density-wave (SDW) quantum
critical point (QCP). Inelastic neutron scattering results highlight that both
quantum critical SDW fluctuations as well as Mott-type fluctuations of local
magnetic moments contribute to the formation of Cooper pairs in CeCu$_2$Si$_2$.
In YbRh$_2$Si$_2$, superconductivity appears to be suppressed at $T\gtrsim~10$
mK by AF order ($T_N$ = 70 mK). Ultra-low temperature measurements reveal a
hybrid order between nuclear and 4f-electronic spins, which is dominated by the
Yb-derived nuclear spins, to develop at $T_A$ slightly above 2 mK. The hybrid
order turns out to strongly compete with the primary 4f-electronic order and to
push the material towards its QCP. Apparently, this paves the way for
heavy-fermion superconductivity to form at $T_c$ = 2 mK. Like the pressure -
induced QCP in CeRhIn$_5$, the magnetic field - induced one in YbRh$_2$Si$_2$
is of the local Kondo-destroying variety which corresponds to a Mott-type
transition at zero temperature. Therefore, these materials form the link
between the large family of about fifty low-$T$ unconventional heavy - fermion
superconductors and other families of unconventional superconductors with
higher $T_c$s, notably the doped Mott insulators of the cuprates, organic
charge-transfer salts and some of the Fe-based superconductors. Our study
suggests that heavy-fermion superconductivity near an AF QCP is a robust
phenomenon.

one) belongs to the so-called ""swampland"" and hence cannot be obtained as the
low-energy limit of string theory that requires $|\nabla V| > c V$. If true,
the dark energy needs to be described by an evolving scalar field, i.e.,
quintessence with $w>-1$ within supergravity. However, the large hierarchy
between the supersymmetry breaking scale and the energy scale of dark energy
imposes a challenge on building quintessence models in supergravity as the
quintessence field typically acquires a mass of order the gravitino mass. We
investigate two approaches to circumvent this obstacle. One is imposing shift
symmetry to the quintessence sector, and we demonstrate any quintessence
potential can be embedded into supergravity and the fifth force constraint
gives little limit on quintessence field displacement, leading to possible
observational signature $w>-1$. The structure is stable against quantum
corrections. A particular example can address the cosmic coincidence problem.
The other approach is sequestered supergravity, and the stability requirement
strongly constrains the form of the Kahler potential and superpotential, and
the quintessence field displacement is typically much smaller than Planck mass.
In addition, to satisfy the fifth force constraint, the quintessence field
displacement is further restricted in the sequestered case, requiring $c \ll
1$.

requirement engineering for individual stakeholders, based on the current
pain-points of their organizations when dealing with a large number
requirements. Method: We conducted a multiple case study with three companies
in different domains. We collected data through ten semi-structured interviews
with experts from these companies. Results: The main pain-point for
stakeholders is handling the vast amount of data from different sources. The
foreseen platform should leverage such data to manage changes in requirements
according to customers' and users' preferences. It should also offer
stakeholders an estimation of how long a requirements engineering task will

of an external magnetic field. An unexpected competition between different
spin-spin correlations is uncovered. Multiple spin-flop transitions are
identified with the help of component resolved correlation functions. For the
material-specific choice of model parameters we discuss the temperature
dependence of specific heat and magnetic susceptibility, and compare our
results with the available experimental data. A detailed account of spin-spin

low-temperature magnetic ordering in CuInVO$_5$. Most notably, we identify the

concept of geometric realization for derived noncommutative scheme is
introduced and problems of existence and construction of such realizations are
discussed. We also study the construction of gluing noncommutative schemes via
morphisms and consider some new phenomena, such as phantoms, quasi-phantoms,

allowing us to find new noncommutative schemes. In the last sections we
consider noncommutative schemes that are related to basic finite dimensional
algebras. It is proved that such noncommutative schemes have special geometric
realizations under which the algebra goes to a vector bundle on a smooth
projective scheme. Such realizations are constructed in two steps, one of which
is the well-known construction of Auslander, while the second step is connected
with a new concept of a well-formed quasi-hereditary algebra for which there
are very particular geometric realizations sending standard modules to line

continuous photo-streams, and annotations in lifelogging are scarce and costly,
the frames are usually clustered into events by comparing the visual features
between them in an unsupervised way. However, such methodologies are
ineffective to deal with heterogeneous events, e.g. taking a walk, and
temporary changes in the sight direction, e.g. at a meeting. To address these
limitations, we propose Contextual Event Segmentation (CES), a novel
segmentation paradigm that uses an LSTM-based generative network to model the
photo-stream sequences, predict their visual context, and track their
evolution. CES decides whether a frame is an event boundary by comparing the
visual context generated from the frames in the past, to the visual context
predicted from the future. We implemented CES on a new and massive lifelogging

Experiments on the popular EDUB-Seg dataset show that our model outperforms the
state-of-the-art by over 16% in f-measure. Furthermore, CES' performance is

astronomical data causes a sudden transition in time and under increase of the
forcing amplitude, moving the model response from a non-MPT regime to an MPT

bifurcation analysis shows that the transition is not due to a bifurcation but
instead to a shifting basin of attraction. While determining the basin boundary
we demonstrate how one can accurately compute the intersection of a stable

practical applications such as fine-grained sketch based image retrieval

free-hand sketch of a photo is not simply a clean rendering of that photo's
edge map. Instead there is a fundamental process of abstraction and iconic
rendering, where overall geometry is warped and salient details are selectively
included. In this paper we study this sketching process and attempt to invert
it. We model this inversion by translating iconic free-hand sketches to
contours that resemble more geometrically realistic projections of object
boundaries, and separately factorise out the salient added details. This
factorised re-representation makes it easier to match a free-hand sketch to a
photo instance of an object. Specifically, we propose a novel unsupervised
image style transfer model based on enforcing a cyclic embedding consistency
constraint. A deep FG-SBIR model is then formulated to accommodate
complementary discriminative detail from each factorised sketch for better
matching with the corresponding photo. Our method is evaluated both
qualitatively and quantitatively to demonstrate its superiority over a number
of state-of-the-art alternatives for style transfer and FG-SBIR.

a FM transition at a lower temperature. Muon spin relaxation detects the
enhancement of spin fluctuations at high temperatures below 200 K.
Correspondingly, the ab-plane resistivity follows a 4/3 power law in a wide
temperature range, which is characteristic of metals with two-dimensional FM
fluctuations due to itinerant electrons. As the Wilson ratio evidences the
enhancement of spin fluctuations with hole doping in the heavily overdoped

Ray (GCR) spectrum and composition, as well as growing evidence for episodes of
intense dynamical activity in the inner regions of the Galaxy, call for an
evaluation of the high-energy particle acceleration associated with such
activity and its potential impact on the global GCR phenomenology.
  Aims. We investigate whether particles accelerated during high-power episodes
around the Galactic center can account for a significant fraction of the
observed GCRs, or conversely what constraints can be derived regarding their
Galactic transport if their contributions are negligible.
  Methods. We address these questions by studying the contribution of a
continuous source of energetic particles at the Galactic center to the local
GCRs. Particle transport in the Galaxy is described with a two-zone analytical
model. We solve for the contribution of a Galactic Center Cosmic-Ray (GCCR)
source using Green functions and Bessel expansion, and discuss the required
injection power for these GCCRs to influence the global GCR phenomenology at
Earth.
  Results. We find that, with standard parameters for particle propagation in
the galactic disk and halo, the GCCRs can make a significant or even dominant
contribution to the total CR flux observed at Earth. Depending on the
parameters, such a source can account for both the observed proton flux and
B-to-C ratio (in the case of a Kraichnan-like scaling of the diffusion
coefficient), or potentially produce spectral and composition features.
  Conclusions. Our results show that the contribution of GCCRs cannot be
neglected a priori, and that they can influence the global GCR phenomenology
significantly, thereby calling for a reassessement of the standard inferences
from a scenario where GCRs are entirely dominated by a single type of sources
distributed throughout the Galactic disk.

operators results in the possibility of studying the diagonal and non-diagonal
elements of the evolution operator separately. The suggested expression implies
a particular form of perturbation expansion, which leads to a new formula for
the short time dynamics. The new kind of perturbation expansion can be used to
improve the accuracy of the usual chronological exponent significantly. The

obstruction is the lack of links between large-scale geometry and small-scale

dimension) when the unit ball at the point is not collapsed, that is,
$\mathrm{vol}(B_1(p))\ge v>0$. In this paper, we conjecture a new link in terms
of isometries: if the maximal displacement of an isometry $f$ on $B_1(p)$ is at
least $\delta>0$, then the maximal displacement of $f$ on the rescaled unit
ball $r^{-1}B_r(p)$ is at least $\Phi(\delta,n,v)>0$ for all $r\in(0,1)$. We
call this scaling $\Phi$-nonvanishing property at $p$. We study the equivariant
Gromov-Hausdorff convergence of a sequence of Riemannian universal covers with
abelian $\pi_1(M_i,p_i)$-actions
$(\widetilde{M}_i,\tilde{p}_i,\pi_1(M_i,p_i))\overset{GH}\longrightarrow(\widetilde{X},\tilde{p},G)$,
where $\pi_1(M_i,p_i)$-action is scaling $\Phi$-nonvanishing at $\tilde{p_i}$.
We establish a dimension monotonicity on the limit group associated to any
rescaling sequence. As one of the applications, we prove that for an open
manifold $M$ of non-negative Ricci curvature, if the universal cover
$\widetilde{M}$ has Euclidean volume growth and $\pi_1(M,p)$-action on
$R^{-1}\widetilde{M}$ is scaling $\Phi$-nonvanishing at $\tilde{p}$ for all $R$
large, then $\pi_1(M)$ is finitely generated.

SNe~Ia shows distinct features, differing from normal SNe~Ia at early phases
but similar to normal SNe~Ia at a few weeks after maximum light (i.e. the
transitional phase) and well into the nebular phase. The transparency
timescales ($t_0$) for this sample of SNe~Ia range between $\sim$ 25 and 41
days indicating a diversity in the ejecta masses. $t_0$ also weakly correlates
with the peak bolometric luminosity, consistent with the interpretation that
SNe with higher ejecta masses would produce more $^{56}$Ni. Comparing the $t_0$
and the maximum luminosity, L$_{max}$\, distribution of a sample of SNe~Ia to
predictions from a wide range of explosion models we find an indication that
the sub-Chandrasekhar mass models span the range of observed values. However,
the bright end of the distribution can be better explained by Chandrasekhar
mass delayed detonation models, hinting at multiple progenitor channels to
explain the observed bolometric properties of SNe~Ia. iPTF16abc appears to be
consistent with the predictions from the M$_{ch}$ models.

We construct a coding for the random-cluster model on $G$, and show that the
coding is finitary whenever the free and wired measures coincide. This
strengthens a result of H\""aggstr\""om--Jonasson--Lyons. We also prove that the
coding radius has exponential tails in the subcritical regime. As a corollary,
we obtain a similar coding for the subcritical Potts model.
  Our methods are probabilistic in nature, and at their heart lies the use of
coupling-from-the-past for the Glauber dynamics. These methods apply to any
monotone model satisfying mild technical (but natural) requirements. Beyond the
random-cluster and Potts models, we describe two further applications -- the
loop $O(n)$ model and long-range Ising models. In the case of $G =
\mathbb{Z}^d$, we also construct finitary, translation-equivariant codings
using a finite-valued i.i.d. process $Y$. To do this, we extend a mixing-time

in the habitable zone of the M-dwarf star AD Leo. These are bombarded by high
energetic particles which can create showers of secondary particles at the
surface. We apply our cloud-free 1D climate-chemistry model to study the
influence of key particle shower parameters and chemical efficiencies of NOx
and HOx production from cosmic rays. We determine the effect of stellar
radiation and cosmic rays upon atmospheric composition, temperature, and
spectral appearance. Despite strong stratospheric O$_3$ destruction by cosmic
rays, smog O$_3$ can significantly build up in the lower atmosphere of our
modeled planet around AD Leo related to low stellar UVB. N$_2$O abundances
decrease with increasing flaring energies but a sink reaction for N$_2$O with
excited oxygen becomes weaker, stabilizing its abundance. CH$_4$ is removed
mainly by Cl in the upper atmosphere for strong flaring cases and not via
hydroxyl as is otherwise usually the case. Cosmic rays weaken the role of
CH$_4$ in heating the middle atmosphere so that H$_2$O absorption becomes more
important. We additionally underline the importance of HNO$_3$ as a possible
marker for strong stellar particle showers. In a nutshell, uncertainty in NOx

Computational pathology provides a unique opportunity to spatially dissect such
interface on digitised pathological slides. Accurate cellular classification is
a key to ensure meaningful results, but is often challenging even with
state-of-art machine learning and deep learning methods.
  We propose a hierarchical framework, which mirrors the way pathologists
perceive tumour architecture and define tumour heterogeneity to improve cell
classification methods that rely solely on cell nuclei morphology. The SLIC
superpixel algorithm was used to segment and classify tumour regions in low
resolution H&E-stained histological images of melanoma skin cancer to provide a
global context. Classification of superpixels into tumour, stroma, epidermis
and lumen/white space, yielded a 97.7% training set accuracy and 95.7% testing
set accuracy in 58 whole-tumour images of the TCGA melanoma dataset. The
superpixel classification was projected down to high resolution images to
enhance the performance of a single cell classifier, based on cell nuclear
morphological features, and resulted in increasing its accuracy from 86.4% to
91.6%. Furthermore, a voting scheme was proposed to use global context as
biological a priori knowledge, pushing the accuracy further to 92.8%.
  This study demonstrates how using the global spatial context can accurately
characterise the tumour microenvironment and allow us to extend significantly
beyond single-cell morphological classification.

algorithms like point location, linear programming, segment intersections,
binary space partitioning, Clarkson and Shor \cite{CS89} developed a general
framework of randomized incremental construction (RIC ). The basic idea is to
add objects in a random order and show that this approach yields
efficient/optimal bounds on {\bf expected} running time. Even quicksort can be
viewed as a special case of this paradigm. However, unlike quicksort, for most
of these problems, attempts to obtain sharper tail estimates on the running
time had proved inconclusive. Barring some results by
\cite{MSW93,CMS92,Seidel91a}, the general question remains unresolved.
  In this paper we present some general techniques to obtain tail estimates for
  RIC and and provide applications to some fundamental problems like Delaunay
triangulations and construction of Visibility maps of intersecting line
segments. The main result of the paper centers around a new and careful
application of Freedman's \cite{Fre75} inequality for Martingale concentration
that overcomes the bottleneck of the better known Azuma-Hoeffding inequality.
Further, we show instances where an RIC based algorithm may not have inverse
polynomial tail estimates. In particular, we show that the RIC time bounds for
trapezoidal map can encounter a running time of $\Omega (n\log n\log\log n )$
with probability exceeding $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$. This rules out inverse
polynomial concentration bounds around the expected running time.

Fermi surface reconstruction (FSR) into small electron pockets. While the
strong Coulomb repulsion leads to an emergence of the arc-like Fermi surface in
the pseudogap (PG) phase, the Bragg reflection on the boundaries of the reduced

Direct calculation of the FS properties allows us to unveil the scenario of the

simulations of intergalactic-medium heating by stellar sources and high-mass
X-ray binaries (HMXB) during the cosmic dawn. Lyman-$\alpha$ coupling is
assumed to be saturated, we therefore probe the nature of non-Gaussianities
produced by X-ray heating processes. We find the evolution of the normalised
bispectrum to be very different from that of the power spectrum. It exhibits a
turnover whose peak moves from large to small scales with decreasing redshift,
and corresponds to the typical separation of emission regions. This
characteristic scale reduces as more and more regions move into emission with
time. Ultimately, small-scale fluctuations within heated regions come to
dominate the normalised bispectrum, which at the end of the simulation is
almost entirely driven by fluctuations in the density field. To establish how
generic the qualitative evolution of the normalised bispectrum we see in the
stellar + HMXB simulation is, we examine several other simulations - two
fully-numerical simulations that include QSO sources, and two with contrasting
source properties produced with the semi-numerical simulation 21cmFAST. We find
the qualitative evolution of the normalised bispectrum during X-ray heating to
be generic, unless the sources of X-rays are, as with QSOs, less numerous and
so exhibit more distinct isolated heated profiles. Assuming mitigation of
foreground and instrumental effects are ultimately effective, we find that we

Finite time convergence to a desired set in the state space is guaranteed under

In addition, these barrier functions also guarantee forward invariance once the
system converges to the desired set. This allows us to formulate a theoretical
framework which synthesizes controllers for the multi-agent system. These
properties also enable us to solve the reachability problem in continuous time

logic is used to specify complex task specifications that need to be satisfied

most crucial factors that drive preterm infant's neurodevelopmental and health
outcomes. It is hypothesized that stressful early life experience of very
preterm neonate is imprinting gut microbiome by the regulation of the so-called
brain-gut axis, and consequently, certain microbiome markers are predictive of
later infant neurodevelopment. To investigate, a preterm infant study was
conducted; infant fecal samples were collected during the infants' first month
of postnatal age, resulting in functional compositional microbiome data, and
neurobehavioral outcomes were measured when infants reached 36-38 weeks of
post-menstrual age. To identify potential microbiome markers and estimate how
the trajectories of gut microbiome compositions during early postnatal stage
impact later neurobehavioral outcomes of the preterm infants, we innovate a
sparse log-contrast regression with functional compositional predictors. The
functional simplex structure is strictly preserved, and the functional
compositional predictors are allowed to have sparse, smoothly varying, and
accumulating effects on the outcome through time. Through a pragmatic basis
expansion step, the problem boils down to a linearly constrained sparse group
regression, for which we develop an efficient algorithm and obtain theoretical

countable group on a compact Hausdorff space. We show that, under the
hypothesis that the action $\alpha$ is topologically free and has no
$G$-invariant regular Borel probability measure on $X$, dynamical comparison
implies that the reduced crossed product of $\alpha$ is purely infinite and
simple. This result, as an application, shows a dichotomy between stable
finiteness and pure infiniteness for reduced crossed products arising from
actions satisfying dynamical comparison. We also introduce the concepts of
paradoxical comparison and the uniform tower property. Under the hypothesis
that the action $\alpha$ is exact and essentially free, we show that
paradoxical comparison together with the uniform tower property implies that
the reduced crossed product of $\alpha$ is purely infinite. As applications, we
provide new results on pure infiniteness of reduced crossed products in which
the underlying spaces are not necessarily zero-dimensional. Finally, we study
the type semigroups of actions on the Cantor set in order to establish the
equivalence of almost unperforation of the type semigroup and comparison. This
sheds a light to a question arising in the paper of R{\o}rdam and Sierakowski.

asymmetry and strong magnetic fields. Its first chapter is devoted to the phase
diagram of isospin-asymmetrical nuclear matter in the density-temperature
plane. Four competing phases of matter are included into the consideration: the
unpaired phase, the ordinary Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) phase, a phase
where normal fluid and superfluid separate into distinct domains and the
superfluid phase with a non-zero total momentum of Cooper pairs. The evolution
of these phases from the weakly BCS limit to the strongly coupled
Bose-Einstein-Condensate limit is studied by varying the density from high to
low values at various temperatures and asymmetries. The emergence of
tri-critical points (including a Lifshitz point) and various intrinsic
properties of the condensate (pair wave-function, occupation numbers,
quasiparticle spectra) are discussed. The second chapter studies the nuclei
$^{12}$C, $^{16}$O, and $^{20}$Ne in a magnetic field $B\approx 10^{17}\,$G by
utilizing the SKY3D code, suitably extended to include the magnetic field. Our
solutions of time-independent Hartree-Fock equations on a Cartesian
three-dimensional grid with a Skyrme interaction demonstrate a number of
interesting phenomena, such as level splitting in the magnetic field,
spontaneous rearrangement of energy levels, changes in the nuclear shape, etc.
The third chapter studies the pairing in low-density neutron matter in the
presence of a strong magnetic field. In particular, we find the limiting field
for the destruction of the superfluidity of neutrons in the crust and outer
core of magnetars. This field is density-dependent but is generally of the
order of $B\geq 10^{17}\,$G. The phase diagram of spin-polarized neutron matter
is constructed in the case where only the BCS phase is allowed along with the
(spin-polarized) normal phase.

dimensional viscoelastic body is studied. Its mechanical behaviour is described
via an integro-differential equation, whose kernel represents the relaxation
modulus, characteristic of the viscoelastic material under investigation.
According to the classical model, to guarantee the thermodynamical
compatibility of the model itself, such a kernel satisfies regularity
conditions which include the integrability of its time derivative. To adapt the
model to a wider class of materials, this condition is relaxed; that is,
conversely to what is generally assumed, no integrability condition is imposed
on the time derivative of the relaxation modulus. Hence, the case of a
relaxation modulus which is unbounded at the initial time t = 0, is considered,
so that a singular kernel integro-differential equation, is studied. In this
framework, the existence of a weak solution is proved in the case of a three
dimensional singular kernel initial boundary value problem.

trivial solutions and not necessarily verify any form of null conditions. For
compactly supported small data, one can only have a semi-global result which
states that the solutions are well-posed upto a finite time-span depending on
the size of the Cauchy data. For some of the equations of the class, the
solutions blow up within a finite time for the compactly supported data of any
size. For data prescribed on ${\mathbb R}^3\setminus B_R$ with small weighted
energy, without some form of null conditions on the nonlinearity, the exterior
stability is not expected to hold in the full domain of dependence.
  In this paper, we prove that, there exists a constant $R(\ga_0)\ge 2$,
depending on the fixed weight exponent $\ga_0>1$ in the weighted energy norm,
if the norm of the data are sufficiently small on ${\mathbb R}^3\setminus B_R$
with the fixed number $R\ge R(\ga_0)$, the solution exists and is unique in the
entire exterior of a schwarzschild cone initiating from $\{|x|=R\}$ (including
the boundary) with small negative mass $-M_0$. $M_0$ is determined according to
the size of the initial data. In this exterior region, by constructing the
schwarzschild cone foliation, we can improve the linear behavior of wave
equations in particular on the transversal derivative $\Lb \phi$. Such
improvement enables us to control the nonlinearity violating the null condition
without loss, and thus show the solutions converge to the trivial solution.
  As an application, we give the exterior stability result for Einstein
(massive and massless) scalar fields. We prove the solution converges to a
small static solution, stable in the entire exterior of a schwarzschild cone
with positive mass, which then is patchable to the interior results.

be modelled as exponential polynomials and rational functions. We find
conditions on the terms which guarantee that the decomposition is unique and
can be computed by means of the eigenvalue decomposition of a matrix even in
the cases where none of the factor matrices has full column rank. We consider
both the case where the decomposition is exact and the case where the
decomposition holds only approximately. We show that in both cases the number
of the terms $R$ and their ""sizes"" $L_1,...,L_R$ do not have to be known a
priori and can be estimated as well. The conditions for uniqueness are easy to
verify, especially for terms that can be considered ""generic"". In particular,
we obtain the following two generalizations of a well known result on generic
uniqueness of the CPD (i.e., the case $L_1=...=L_R=1$): we show that the
multilinear rank-$(1,L_r,L_r)$ decomposition of an $I\times J\times K$ tensor
is generically unique if i) $L_1=...=L_R=:L$ and $R\leq\min((J-L)(K-L),I)$ or
if ii) $\sum L_R\leq\min((I-1)(J-1),K)$ and $J\geq\max(L_i+L_j)$.

evidence, adoption of active learning in computer science remains relatively
low. To identify what barriers to adoption exist, an electronic survey was sent
to 369 computer science faculty in a state in the Upper Midwest and to 78
administrators and support staff. Analysis of the responses revealed that time
remained the most commonly reported barrier for faculty that desire to change
their teaching style, with 42.8% of faculty respondents disagreeing with the
statement that they have the time they need to change their teaching style.
Administrators and support staff also indicated that time was a concern but
that otherwise faculty were aware of active learning and had the resources they
need. Reported use of active learning pedagogy was much higher among faculty
that received pedagogical training during their undergraduate or graduate

paramagnetic materials have in many cases been found to initially increase with
increasing thermal disorder and hence exhibit peaks as a function of

'order-by-disorder' phenomenona has remained elusive in nearly ferromagnetic
metals and in dielectrics on the border of displacive ferroelectric
transitions. Here we present an experimental study of the evolution of the
dielectric susceptibility peak as a function of pressure in the nearly
ferroelectric material, strontium titanate, which reveals that the peak
position collapses towards absolute zero as the ferroelectric quantum critical
point is approached. We show that this behaviour can be described in detail
without the use of adjustable parameters in terms of the
Larkin-Khmelnitskii-Shneerson-Rechester (LKSR) theory, first introduced nearly
50 years ago, of the hybridization of polar and acoustic modes in quantum
paraelectrics, in contrast to alternative models that have been proposed. Our
study allows us to construct for the first time a detailed temperature-pressure
phase diagram of a material on the border of a ferroelectric quantum critical
point comprising ferroelectric, quantum critical paraelectric and hybridized
polar-acoustic regimes. Furthermore, at the lowest temperatures, below the
susceptibility maximum, we observe a new regime characterized by a linear
temperature dependence of the inverse susceptibility that differs sharply from
the quartic temperature dependence predicted by the LKSR theory. We find that
this non-LKSR low temperature regime cannot be accounted for in terms of any
detailed model reported in the literature, and its interpretation poses a new
empirical and conceptual challenge.

that give rise to a heat capacity and phonon scattering in great excess over
what would be expected for a solid that has a unique vibrational ground state.
Of particular conceptual importance is the apparent near universality of phonon
scattering in amorphous solids made by quenching a liquid. To rationalise this
universality, scale-free scenarios have been proposed that either hinge on
there being long-range interactions between bare structural degrees of freedom
or that invoke long-range criticality stemming from the emergence of marginally
stable vibrational modes. In a contrasting, local scenario, the puzzling
low-temperature degrees of freedom are, instead, weakly-interacting, strongly
anharmonic degrees of freedom each of which involves the motion of a few
hundred particles. In this scenario, the universality of phonon scattering
comes about because the characteristic energy scale of the local anharmonic
resonances and the strength of their interaction with phonons are both set by
the glass transition temperature $T_g$, while their concentration is set by the
cooperativity size $\xi$ for dynamics at $T_g$. The nanoscopic length $\xi$ is
manifested in vibrational excitations of the spatial boundary of the
resonances, which underlie the so-called Boson peak, and very deep, topological
midgap electronic states in glassy semiconductors, which are implicated in a
number of strange optoelectronic phenomena in amorphous chalcogenides. I
discuss the merits of the above scenarios when confronted with experimental

widely used in Granger causality analysis (GCA), which is the most commonly
used method to detect the causality between a pair of time series. However,
when signals are seriously contaminated by non-Gaussian noises, the LRM
coefficients will be inaccurately identified. This may cause the GCA to detect
a wrong causal relationship. Minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion can be used
to replace the MSE criterion to deal with the non-Gaussian noises. But its
calculation requires a double summation operation, which brings computational
bottlenecks to GCA especially when sizes of the signals are large. To address
the aforementioned problems, in this study we propose a new method called GCA
based on the quantized MEE (QMEE) criterion (GCA-QMEE), in which the QMEE
criterion is applied to identify the LRM coefficients and the quantized error
entropy is used to calculate the causality indexes. Compared with the
traditional GCA, the proposed GCA-QMEE not only makes the results more
discriminative, but also more robust. Its computational complexity is also not
high because of the quantization operation. Illustrative examples on synthetic
and EEG datasets are provided to verify the desirable performance and the
availability of the GCA-QMEE.

solution approach: discretize the slow component with an explicit Runge-Kutta
method, and advance the fast component via a modified fast differential
equation. The idea led to the development of multirate infinitesimal step (MIS)

both the number of cancer patients admitted to the ICU and overall survival

critical care database of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, USA was
used to retrospectively study trends and outcomes of cancer patients admitted
to the ICU between 2002 and 2011. Multiple logistic regression analysis was
performed to adjust for confounders of 28-day and 1-year mortality.
  Out of 41,468 unique ICU admissions, 1,100 hemato-oncologic, 3,953 oncologic
and 49 patients with both a hematological and solid malignancy were analyzed.
Hematological patients had higher critical illness scores than non-cancer
patients, while oncologic patients had similar APACHE-III and SOFA-scores
compared to non-cancer patients. In the univariate analysis, cancer was
strongly associated with mortality (OR= 2.74, 95%CI: 2.56, 2.94). Over the
10-year study period, 28-day mortality of cancer patients decreased by 30%.
This trend persisted after adjustment for covariates, with cancer patients
having significantly higher mortality (OR=2.63, 95%CI: 2.38, 2.88). Between
2002 and 2011, both the adjusted odds of 28-day mortality and the adjusted odds
of 1-year mortality for cancer patients decreased by 6% (95%CI: 4%, 9%). Having
cancer was the strongest single predictor of 1-year mortality in the
multivariate model (OR=4.47, 95%CI: 4.11, 4.84).

order, through the tidal deformabilities (Lambdas) of the stars. If strong
first-order phase transitions do not exist within neutron stars, both neutron
stars are described by the same equation of state, and their Lambdas are highly
correlated through their masses even if the equation of state is unknown. If,
however, a strong phase transition exists between the central densities of the
two stars, so that the more massive star has a phase transition and the least
massive star does not, this correlation will be weakened. In all cases, a
minimum Lambda for each neutron star mass is imposed by causality, and a less
conservative limit is imposed by the unitary gas constraint, both of which we
compute. In order to make the best use of gravitational wave data from mergers,
it is important to include the correlations relating the Lambdas and the masses
as well as lower limits to the Lambdas as a function of mass. Focusing on the
case without strong phase transitions, and for mergers where the chirp mass
M_chirp<1.4M_sun, which is the case for all observed double neutron star
systems where a total mass has been accurately measured, we show that the
dimensionless Lambdas satisfy Lambda_1/Lambda_2= q^6, where q=M_2/M_1 is the
binary mass ratio; $M$ is mass of each star, respectively. Moreover, they are
bounded by q^{n_-}>Lambda_1/Lambda_2> q^{n_{0+}+qn_{1+}}, where
n_-<n_{0+}+qn_{1+}; the parameters depend only on M_chirp, which is accurately
determined from the gravitational-wave signal. We also provide analytic
expressions for the wider bounds that exist in the case of a strong phase
transition. We argue that bounded ranges for Lambda_1/Lambda_2, tuned to
M_chirp, together with lower bounds to Lambda(M), will be more useful in
gravitational waveform modeling than other suggested approaches.

generation as well as dual-channel equalization based on an integrated
dual-polarization-mode high-Q microring resonator. The device operates in the
optical communications band and enables narrowband RF operation at either 16.6
GHz or 32.2 GHz, determined by the free spectral range and TE/TM mode interval
in the resonator. We achieve a very large dynamic tuning range of over 55 dB
for both the optical carrier-to-sideband ratio and the dual-channel RF
equalization.

unify continuous and discrete analyses in higher dimensions. In this paper we
investigate massive scalar field theory on a regular $n$-Scale. We have given
the modified field equation that is appropriate to this space-time structure
and gave the mode solutions. If the space-time is discrete we have found that
no massive scalar field can exist. Hence, we concluded that unbounded discrete
space-time cannot exist. If discrete space-time exists, it has to be bounded in
each dimension.

have developed a polymer waveguide platform capable of robust, polarization
insensitive single mode guiding over a broad range of visible and near-
infrared wavelengths. These devices have considerable elasticity, which we
exploit to enable tuning of optical behaviour by precise mechanical
deformations. In this work, we investigate pairs of beamsplitters arranged as
interferometers. These systems demonstrate stable operation over a wide range
of phases and reflectivities. We discuss device performance, and present an
outlook on flexible polymer chips supporting large, reconfigurable optical
circuits.

  Multi-cores",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Heterogeneous multi-cores utilize the strength of different architectures for
executing particular types of workload, and usually offer higher performance
and energy efficiency. In this paper, we study the worst-case response time
(WCRT) analysis of \emph{typed} scheduling of parallel DAG tasks on
heterogeneous multi-cores, where the workload of each vertex in the DAG is only
allowed to execute on a particular type of cores. The only known WCRT bound for
this problem is grossly pessimistic and suffers the
\emph{non-self-sustainability} problem. In this paper, we propose two new WCRT
bounds. The first new bound has the same time complexity as the existing bound,
but is more precise and solves its \emph{non-self-sustainability} problem. The
second new bound explores more detailed task graph structure information to
greatly improve the precision, but is computationally more expensive. We prove
that the problem of computing the second bound is strongly NP-hard if the
number of types in the system is a variable, and develop an efficient algorithm
which has polynomial time complexity if the number of types is a constant.
Experiments with randomly generated workload show that our proposed new methods
are significantly more precise than the existing bound while having good
scalability.
