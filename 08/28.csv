renormalized energy is characterized in the space of probability measures. This
corresponds to a discrete-to-continuum limit of the dislocations, which, as a
byproduct, provides information on their distribution when the circulation of
the tangential component of the external strain becomes larger and larger. In
particular, dislocations are shown to concentrate at the boundary of the

  characteristics and stress history","Manuscript submitted to International Journal of Solids and
  Structures",,,,"physics.geo-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Elastic wave propagation provides a noninvasive way to probe granular
materials. The discrete element method using particle configuration as input,
allows a micromechanical interpretation on the acoustic response of a given
granular system. This paper compares static and dynamic numerical probing
methods, from which wave velocities are either deduced from elastic moduli or
extracted from the time/frequency-domain signals. The dependence of wave
velocities on key characteristics, i.e., perturbation magnitude and direction
for static probing, and maximum travel distance and inserted signals for
dynamic probing, is investigated. It is found that processing the
frequency-domain signals obtained from dynamic probing leads to reproducible
wave velocities at all wavenumbers, irrespective of the perturbation
characteristics, whereas the maximum travel distance and input signals for the
time domain analysis have to be carefully chosen, so as to obtain the same
long-wavelength limits as from the frequency domain. Static and dynamic probes
are applied to calibrated representative volumes of glass beads, subjected to
cyclic oedometric compression. Although the perturbation magnitudes are
selected to reveal only the elastic moduli, the deduced wave velocities are
consistently lower than the long-wavelength limits at various stress states,
and thus sensitive to sample size. While the static probes investigate the
influence of stress history on modulus degradation, dynamic probing offers
insights about how dispersion relations evolve during cyclic compression.
Interestingly, immediately after each load reversal the incremental behavior is
reversibly elastoplastic, until it becomes truly elastic with further
unload/reload. With repeating unload/reload, the P- or S-wave dispersion
relations become increasingly scalable with respect to their long-wavelength
limits.

Planck constant $h$ relates the momentum $p$ of a massive particle to its de
Broglie wavelength $\lambda=h/p$. The superposition principle is one of the
main postulates of quantum mechanics; diffraction and interference phenomena
are therefore predicted and have been observed on objects of increasing
complexity, from electrons to neutrons and molecules. Beyond the early electron
diffraction experiments, the demonstration of single-electron double-slit-like
interference was a highly sought-after result. Initially proposed by Richard
Feynman as a thought experiment it was finally carried out in 1976. A few years
later, positron diffraction was first observed. However, an analog of the
double-slit experiment has not been performed to date on any system containing
antimatter. Here we present the first observation of matter wave interference
of single positrons, by using a period-magnifying Talbot-Lau interferometer
based on material diffraction gratings. Individual positrons in the 8-14 keV
energy range from a monochromatic beam were detected by high-resolution nuclear
emulsions. The observed energy dependence of fringe contrast proves the
quantum-mechanical origin of the detected periodic pattern and excludes
classical projective effects. Talbot-Lau interferometers are well-suited to the
experimental challenges posed by low intensity antimatter beams and represent a
promising option for measuring the gravitational acceleration of neutral
antimatter.

  We provide bounds on values $C,c$ depending on the parameter $\theta$ of the

a phase transition in the quantum Heisenberg ferromagnet on $H(2,n)$, namely
for low enough temperatures spontaneous magnetization occurs, while it is not
the case for high temperatures.
  At the core of our approach is a novel application of the cyclic random walk,
which might be of independent interest. By analyzing explorations of the cyclic
random walk, we show that sufficiently long cycles of a random permutation are

realistic situation, we now modulate this periodic variation with an envelope,
giving thus more emphasis on localized bipolar magnetic structures in the
middle of the domain. Some notable findings are: (i) compared to the purely
hydrodynamic case, the strength of the $f$-mode is significantly larger at high
horizontal wavenumbers $k$, but the fanning is weaker for the localized
subsurface magnetic field concentrations investigated here than the periodic
ones studied earlier; (ii) when the strength of the magnetic field is enhanced
at a fixed depth below the surface, the fanning of the $f$-mode in the
$k\omega$ diagram increases proportionally in such a way that the normalized
$f$-mode strengths remain nearly the same in different such cases; (iii) the
unstable Bloch modes reported previously in case of harmonically varying
magnetic fields are now completely absent when more realistic localized
magnetic field concentrations are imposed beneath the surface, thus suggesting
that the Bloch modes are unlikely to be supported during most phases of the
solar cycle; (iv) the $f$-mode strength appears to depend also on the depth of
magnetic field concentrations such that it shows a relative decrement when the
maximum of the magnetic field is moved to a deeper layer. We argue that
detections of $f$-mode perturbations such as those being explored here could be
effective tracers of solar magnetic fields below the photosphere before these

recombination era. In the case of H, reionization finishes around $z\sim 6$.
Faint star-forming galaxies are the best candidate sources of the H-ionizing
radiation, although active galactic nuclei may have also contributed. We have
explored whether the termination regions of the jets from active galactic
nuclei may have contributed significantly to the ionization of H in the late
reionization epoch, around $z\sim 6-7$. We assumed that, as it has been
proposed, active galactic nuclei at $z\sim 6$ may have presented a high jet
fraction, accretion rate, and duty cycle, and that non-thermal electrons
contribute significantly to the pressure of jet termination regions. Empirical
black-hole mass functions were adopted to characterize the population of active
galactic nuclei. From all this, estimates were derived for the isotropic
H-ionizing radiation produced in the jet termination regions, at $z\sim 6$,
through inverse Compton scattering off CMB photons. We find that the
termination regions of the jets of active galactic nuclei may have radiated
most of their energy in the form of H-ionizing radiation at $z\sim 6$. For
typical black-hole mass functions at that redshift, under the considered
conditions (long-lasting, common, and very active galactic nuclei with jets),
the contribution of these jets to maintain (and possibly enhance) the
ionization of H may have been non-negligible. We conclude that the termination
regions of jets from active galactic nuclei could have had a significant role
in the reionization of the Universe at $z\gtrsim 6$.

$\lfloor \log n \rfloor$). Our first main result is a uniform protocol for
calculating $\log(n) \pm O(1)$ with high probability in $O(\log^2 n)$ time and
$O(\log^4 n)$ states ($O(\log \log n)$ bits of memory). The protocol is
converging but not terminating: it does not signal when the estimate is close

allow composition with protocols, such as those for leader election or
majority, that require a size estimate initially, to make them uniform (though

leaderless phase clock, demonstrating that those protocols can in fact be made

for any task requiring more than constant time cannot be terminating even with
probability bounded above 0, if infinitely many initial configurations are
dense: any state present initially occupies $\Omega(n)$ agents. (In particular,
no leader is allowed.) Crucially, the result holds no matter the memory or time

to study the microscopic mechanisms behind intriguing properties of solid
materials and further explore novel exotic phenomena inaccessible by chemical
synthesis. Here we propose and theoretically analyze a coherently coupled
binary mixture of Fermi atoms in a triangular optical lattice as a promising
realization of synthetic frustrated antiferromagnets. We perform a cluster
mean-field plus scaling analysis to show that the ground state exhibits several
nontrivial magnetic phases and a novel spin reorientation transition caused by
the quantum order-by-disorder mechanism. Moreover, we find from Monte Carlo
simulations that thermal fluctuations induce an unexpected coexistence of
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless physics and long-range order in different
correlators. These predictions, besides being relevant to present and future
experiments on triangular antiferromagnetic materials, can be tested in the
laboratory with the combination of the currently available techniques for cold
atoms.

granular medium from the elastic properties, density and geometry of its dry
solid matrix and the pore fluid, neglecting the interaction between constituent
particles and local flow. However, when the frequencies become high and the
wavelengths comparable with particle size, the details of the microstructure
start to play an important role. Here, a novel hydro-micromechanical numerical
model is proposed by coupling the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) with the
discrete element method (DEM. The model allows to investigate the details of
the particle-fluid interaction during propagation of elastic waves While the
DEM is tracking the translational and rotational motion of each solid particle,
the LBM can resolve the pore-scale hydrodynamics. Solid and fluid phases are
two-way coupled through momentum exchange. The coupling scheme is benchmarked
with the terminal velocity of a single sphere settling in a fluid. To mimic a
pressure wave entering a saturated granular medium, an oscillating pressure
boundary condition on the fluid is implemented and benchmarked with
one-dimensional wave equations. Using a face centered cubic structure, the
effects of input waveforms and frequencies on the dispersion relations are
investigated. Finally, the wave velocities at various effective confining
pressures predicted by the numerical model are compared with with Biot's
analytical solution, and a very good agreement is found. In addition to the
pressure and shear waves, slow compressional waves are observed in the
simulations, as predicted by Biot's theory.

a trigonal Mn3 cluster with an unusual structure in which the local magnetic
easy-axes of the constituent Mn(III) ions are tilted significantly away from
the molecular C3 axis towards the magic-angle of 54.7 degrees, resulting in an
almost complete cancelation of the 2nd-order axial magnetic anisotropy
associated with the ferromagnetically coupled total spin ST = 6 ground state.
This contrasts the situation in many related Mn3 single-molecule magnets (SMMs)
that have been studied intensively in the past, for which the local MnIII
anisotropy tensors are reasonably parallel, resulting in substantial barriers
to magnetization relaxation (Ueff = 30 to 35 cm 1) and magnetization blocking
below about 2.5 K. The suppression of the 2nd-order anisotropy in the present
case results in a situation in which the zero-field splitting (ZFS) of the ST =
6 ground state is dominated by 4th- and higher-order interactions. This
provides a unique opportunity to study in depth how molecular geometry
influences these interactions that are responsible for quantum tunneling of
magnetization in high-symmetry SMMs. Angle-dependent EPR measurements provide a
full mapping of the molecular magneto-anisotropy. Meanwhile, irreducible tensor
operator (ITO) methods are employed in order to obtain analytic expressions
that directly relate molecular anisotropy to the microscopic physics, i.e., the
ZFS tensors associated with the individual MnIII ions, their orientations, and
the exchange coupling between the three spins. We find that the magic-angle
tilting leads to a massive compression of the ST = 6 ground state energy level
diagram and strong mixing between spin projection states. Although these
characteristics are antagonistic to SMM behavior, they provide important
insights into the physics of polynuclear molecular nanomagnets.

quantum-walk protocol, an Aharonov-Bohm geometric phase is imprinted onto
closed-loop paths in the lattice, thus realizing an abelian gauge field---the
analog of a magnetic flux threading a two-dimensional electron gas. We show
that in the strong field regime, when the flux per plaquette is a sizable
fraction of the flux quantum, magnetic quantum walks give rise to nearly flat
energy bands featuring nonvanishing Chern numbers. Furthermore, we find that
because of the nonperturbative nature of the periodic driving, a second
topological number---the so-called RLBL invariant---is necessary to fully
characterize the anomalous Floquet topological phases of magnetic quantum walks
and to compute the number of topologically protected edge modes expected at the
boundaries between different phases. In the second part of this article, we
discuss an implementation of this scheme using neutral atoms in two-dimensional
spin-dependent optical lattices, which enables the generation of arbitrary
magnetic-field landscapes, including those with sharp boundaries. The robust
atom transport, which is observed along boundaries separating regions of
different field strength, reveals the topological character of the Floquet

solar flares (stronger than GOES class M5 in general) that took place within

a halo or partial halo coronal mass ejection (CME) (i.e., ejective events),
while the others are CMEless (i.e., confined events). This is a complete sample
of solar events satisfying our selection criteria detailed in the paper. For
each event, we calculate decay index $n$ of the potential strapping field above
the magnetic flux rope (MFR) in and around the flaring magnetic polarity
inversion line (a TI parameter), and the unsigned twist number $T_w$ of the
non-linear force-free (NLFF) field lines forming the same MFR (a KI parameter).
We then construct a $n-T_w$ diagram to investigate how the eruptiveness depends
on these parameters. We find: (1) $T_w$ appears to play little role in
discriminating between confined and ejective events; (2) the events with
$n\gtrsim0.8$ are all ejective and all confined events have $n\lesssim0.8$.
However, $n\gtrsim0.8$ is not a necessary condition for eruption, because some
events with $n\lesssim0.8$ also erupted. In addition, we investigate the MFR's
geometrical parameters, apex height and distance between footpoints, as a
possible factor for the eruptiveness. We briefly discuss the difference of the
present result for solar eruptions with that of the laboratory result in terms
of the role played by magnetic reconnection.

propose the SS output layer, which is able to smooth the entire DCNNs by only
replacing the output layer. We evaluate our degridding methods and the SS
output layer thoroughly, and visualize the smoothing effect through effective
receptive field analysis. Results show that our methods degridding yield
consistent improvements on the performance of dense prediction tasks, while
adding negligible amounts of extra training parameters. And the SS output layer
improves the performance significantly and is very efficient in terms of number

photoionization calculations, coupled to a 2.5-dimensional MHD-driven wind

the anti-correlation of its EW with X-ray strength of PDS 456. This work
demonstrates that UFOs, even without radiative pressure, can be driven as an

the hydrostatic equilibrium, although the plasma moves. The equilibrium is
achieved by the generation of a magnetic field that emerges by the interplay

Bernoulli bond percolation satisfy the following continuity property: If
$(G_n)_{n\geq 1}$ is a sequence of transitive graphs converging locally to a
transitive graph $G$ and $\limsup_{n\to\infty} p_c(G_n) < 1$, then $
p_c(G_n)\to p_c(G)$ as $n\to\infty$. We verify this conjecture under the
additional hypothesis that there is a uniform exponential lower bound on the
volume growth of the graphs in question. The result is new even in the case
that the sequence of graphs is uniformly nonamenable.
  In the unimodular case, this result is obtained as a corollary to the
following theorem of independent interest: For every $g>1$ and $M<\infty$,
there exist positive constants $C=C(g,M)$ and $\delta=\delta(g,M)$ such that if
$G$ is a transitive unimodular graph with degree at most $M$ and growth
$\operatorname{gr}(G) := \inf_{r\geq 1} |B(o,r)|^{1/r}\geq g$, then \[
\mathbf{P}_{p_c} \bigl(|K_o|\geq n\bigr) \leq C n^{-\delta} \] for every $n\geq
1$, where $K_o$ is the cluster of the root vertex $o$. The proof of this
inequality makes use of new universal bounds on the probabilities of certain
two-arm events, which hold for every unimodular transitive graph.

kappa, which is treated as a new phenomenological parameter and, together with
the velocity-dependent coupling, allows for a perturbative treatment of the

only the value kappa=1 may restore unitarity. However from an

erosion, and induce sand deposition and dune formation in areas affected by
sand encroachment and desertification. However, the search for the most
efficient array of fences by means of field experiments alone poses a
challenging task given that field experiments are affected by weather
conditions. Here we apply Computational Fluid Dynamic simulations to
investigate the three-dimensional structure of the turbulent wind field over an
array of fences of different sizes, porosity and spacing. Our goal is to
perform a quantitative analysis of this structure in the absence of saltation
or suspension transport, as first step toward the development of a continuum
simulation of the aeolian soil in presence of the fences. We find that the area
of soil protected against direct aerodynamic entrainment has two regimes,
depending on the spacing $L_x$ between the fences. When $L_x$ is smaller than a
critical value $L_{xc}$, the wake zones associated with each fence are
inter-connected (regime A), while these wake zones appear separated from each
other (regime B) when $L_x$ exceeds this critical value of spacing. The system
undergoes a second order phase transition at $L_x = L_{xc}$, with the
cross-wind width of the protected zone scaling with
$\left[{1-{L}_x}/{L}_{xc}\right]^\beta$ in regime A, with $\beta \approx 0.32$.
Our findings have implication for a better understanding of aeolian transport
in the presence of sand fences, as well as to develop optimization strategies
for measures to protect soils from wind erosion.

settings such as multispecies cell populations, population genetics, and
ecology. This empirical observation that the number of species $c_{k}$
represented by $k$ individuals scales as negative powers of $k$ is also
supported by a series of theoretical birth-death-immigration (BDI) models that
consistently predict many low-population species, a few intermediate-population
species, and very high-population species. However, we show how a simple global
population-dependent regulation in a neutral BDI model destroys the power law
distributions. Simulation of the regulated BDI model shows a high probability
of observing a high-population species that dominates the total population.
Further analysis reveals that the origin of this breakdown is associated with
the failure of a mean-field approximation for the expected species abundance
distribution. We find an accurate estimate for the expected distribution
$\langle c_k \rangle$ by mapping the problem to a lower-dimensional Moran
process, allowing us to also straightforwardly calculate the covariances
$\langle c_k c_\ell \rangle$. Finally, we exploit the concepts associated with
energy landscapes to explain the failure of the mean-field assumption by
identifying a phase transition in the quasi-steady-state species counts
triggered by a decreasing immigration rate.

moving through an Eulerian grid where the (relativistic) MHD equations are
solved concurrently. Lagrangian particles follow fluid streamlines and
represent ensembles of (real) relativistic particles with a finite energy
distribution. The spectral distribution of each particle is updated in time by
solving the relativistic cosmic ray transport equation based on local fluid
conditions. This enables us to account for a number of physical processes, such
as adiabatic expansion, synchrotron and inverse Compton emission. An accurate
semi-analytically numerical scheme that combines the method of characteristics
with a Lagrangian discretization in the energy coordinate is described.
  In presence of (relativistic) magnetized shocks, a novel approach to
consistently model particle energization due to diffusive shock acceleration
has been presented. Our approach relies on a refined shock-detection algorithm
and updates the particle energy distribution based on the shock compression
ratio, magnetic field orientation and amount of (parameterized) turbulence. The
evolved distribution from each \textit{Lagrangian} particle is further used to
produce observational signatures like emission maps and polarization signals
accounting for proper relativistic corrections. We further demonstrate the
validity of this hybrid framework using standard numerical benchmarks and

(Sgr A*), are dominated by interstellar scattering. Previous studies of Sgr A*
have adopted an anisotropic Gaussian model for both the intrinsic source and
the scattering, and they have extrapolated the scattering using a purely
$\lambda^2$ scaling to estimate intrinsic properties. However, physically
motivated source and scattering models break all three of these assumptions.
They also predict that refractive scattering effects will be significant, which
have been ignored in standard model fitting procedures. We analyze radio
observations of Sgr A* using a physically motivated scattering model, and we
develop a prescription to incorporate refractive scattering uncertainties when
model fitting. We show that an anisotropic Gaussian scattering kernel is an
excellent approximation for Sgr A* at wavelengths longer than 1cm, with an
angular size of $(1.380 \pm 0.013) \lambda_{\rm cm}^2\,{\rm mas}$ along the
major axis, $(0.703 \pm 0.013) \lambda_{\rm cm}^2\,{\rm mas}$ along the minor

turbulent dissipation scale is at least $600\,{\rm km}$, with tentative support
for $r_{\rm in} = 800 \pm 200\,{\rm km}$, suggesting that the ion Larmor radius
defines the dissipation scale. We find that the power-law index for density
fluctuations in the scattering material is $\beta < 3.47$, shallower than
expected for a Kolmogorov spectrum ($\beta=11/3$), and we estimate $\beta =
3.38^{+0.08}_{-0.04}$ in the case of $r_{\rm in} = 800\,{\rm km}$. We find that
the intrinsic structure of Sgr A* is nearly isotropic over wavelengths from
1.3mm to 1.3cm, with a size that is roughly proportional to wavelength. We
discuss implications for models of Sgr A*, for theories of interstellar
turbulence, and for imaging Sgr A* with the Event Horizon Telescope.

low-metallicity environments, because in a single massive star scenario, low
iron abundance prevents loss of angular momentum through stellar wind,
resulting in ultra-relativistic jets and the burst. In this sense, not just a
simple metallicity measurement but also low iron abundance ([Fe/H]<-1.0) is
essentially important. Observationally, however, oxygen abundance has been
measured more often due to stronger emission. In terms of oxygen abundance,
some GRBs have been reported to be hosted by high-metallicity star-forming
galaxies, in tension with theoretical predictions. Here we compare iron and
oxygen abundances for the first time for GRB host galaxies (GRB 980425 and
080517) based on the emission-line diagnostics. The estimated total iron
abundances, including iron in both gas and dust, are well below the solar
value. The total iron abundances can be explained by the typical value of
theoretical predictions ([Fe/H]<-1.0), despite high oxygen abundance in one of
them. According to our iron abundance measurements, the single massive star
scenario still survives even if the oxygen abundance of the host is very high,
such as the solar value. Relying only on oxygen abundance could mislead us on
the origin of the GRBs. The measured oxygen-to-iron ratios, [O/Fe], can be
comparable to the highest values among the iron-measured galaxies in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey. Possible theoretical explanations of such high [O/Fe]
include the young age of the hosts, top-heavy initial mass function, and
fallback mechanism of the iron element in supernova explosions.

in terms of an independent connection, and a matter Lagrangian, are found. The
solutions are worked in the scalar-tensor representation of the theory, where
the Palatini field is traded for two scalars, $\varphi$ and $\psi$, and the
gravitational term $R$ is maintained. The main interest in the solutions found
is that the matter field obeys the null energy condition (NEC) everywhere,
including the throat and up to infinity, so that there is no need for exotic
matter. The wormhole geometry with its flaring out at the throat is supported
by the higher-order curvature terms, or equivalently, by the two fundamental
scalar fields, which either way can be interpreted as a gravitational fluid.
Thus, in this theory, in building a wormhole, it is possible to exchange the
exoticity of matter by the exoticity of the gravitational sector. The specific
wormhole displayed, built to obey the matter NEC from the throat to infinity,
has three regions, namely, an interior region containing the throat, a thin
shell of matter, and a vacuum Schwarzschild anti-de Sitter (AdS) exterior. For
hybrid metric-Palatini matter theories this wormhole solution is the first
where the NEC for the matter is verified for the entire spacetime keeping the
solution under asymptotic control. The existence of this type of solutions is
in line with the idea that traversable wormholes bore by additional fundamental
gravitational fields, here disguised as scalar fields, can be found without
exotic matter. Concomitantly, the somewhat concocted architecture needed to
assemble a complete wormhole solution for the whole spacetime may imply that in
this class of theories such solutions are scarce.

Fatigue load reductions can be partly accomplished using Individual Pitch
Control (IPC) facilitated by the so-called Multi-Blade Coordinate (MBC)
transformation. This operation transforms and decouples the blade load signals
in a yaw- and tilt-axis. However, in practical scenarios, the resulting
transformed system still shows coupling between the axes, posing a need for
more advanced Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) control architectures. This
paper presents a novel analysis and design framework for decoupling of the
non-rotating axes by the inclusion of an azimuth offset in the reverse MBC
transformation, enabling the application of simple Single-Input Single-Output
(SISO) controllers. A thorough analysis is given by including the azimuth
offset in a frequency-domain representation. The result is evaluated on
simplified blade models, as well as linearizations obtained from the

assessment justify the application of decentralized SISO control loops for IPC.

exact quantum simulations are limited to either small system sizes or to short

spin relaxation which gradually crosses over to emergent diffusive behavior at
long times. For a random initial state we show that CTWA correctly reproduces
the whole spin spectral function. Necessary in this construction is sampling
from properly fluctuating initial conditions: the Dirac mean-field

the flow approaches a maximum Richardson number $Ri_\textrm{max}\approx 0.15$
as $\alpha \rightarrow 0$ at which the entrainment coefficient $E \rightarrow

demonstrating that $E\rightarrow 0$ is not caused by a switch-off of the
turbulent buoyancy flux as conjectured by Ellison (1957). Instead, $E
\rightarrow 0$ occurs as the result of the turbulence intensity going to zero
as $\alpha\rightarrow 0$, due to the flow requiring larger and larger shear to
maintain the same level of turbulence. We develop an approximate model valid
for small $\alpha$ which is able to predict accurately $Ri_f$, $Ri_g$ and
$\Gamma$ as a function of $\alpha$ and their maximum attainable values. The
model predicts an entrainment law of the form $E=0.31(Ri_\textrm{max}-Ri)$,

presented here contribute to a growing body of evidence that an approach to a

First, when there is an outstanding (in terms of Gini Index) prediction among

constraints on the distribution of shapes in the asteroid main belt. Assuming a
triaxial shape model for each asteroid, defined through the axial aspect ratios
a > b and b=c, we find an average b/a=0.80+-0.04 for the ensemble, which is in
agreement with previous results. By combining the Gaia data with asteroid
properties from the literature, we investigate possible correlations of the

Based on our model simulations, we find that main belt asteroids greater than
50 km in diameter on average have higher b/a aspect ratios (are rounder) than
smaller asteroids. We furthermore find significant differences in the shape
distribution of main belt asteroids as a function of the other properties that

the autoencoder is that it learns to map ""normal"" events back to themselves,
but fails to reconstruct ""anomalous"" events that it has never encountered
before. The reconstruction error can then be used as an anomaly threshold. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of this idea using QCD jets as background and
boosted top jets and RPV gluino jets as signal. We show that a deep autoencoder
can significantly improve signal over background when trained on backgrounds
only, or even directly on data which contains a small admixture of signal.
Finally we examine the correlation of the autoencoders with jet mass and show
how the jet mass distribution can be stable against cuts in reconstruction
loss. This may be important for estimating QCD backgrounds from data. As a test
case we show how one could plausibly discover 400 GeV RPV gluinos using an
autoencoder combined with a bump hunt in jet mass. This opens up the exciting
possibility of training directly on actual data to discover new physics with no
prior expectations or theory prejudice.

especially in historical documents, not only in the number of classes extremely
large in comparison to contemporary image retrieval methods, but also new
unseen classes can be expected under open learning conditions (even for CNN).
Chinese character recognition with zero or a few training samples is a
difficult problem and has not been studied yet. In this paper, we propose a new
Chinese character recognition method by multi-type attributes, which are based
on pronunciation, structure and radicals of Chinese characters, applied to
character recognition in historical books. This intermediate attribute code has
a strong advantage over the common `one-hot' class representation because it
allows for understanding complex and unseen patterns symbolically using
attributes. First, each character is represented by four groups of attribute
types to cover a wide range of character possibilities: Pinyin label, layout
structure, number of strokes, three different input methods such as Cangjie,
Zhengma and Wubi, as well as a four-corner encoding method. A convolutional
neural network (CNN) is trained to learn these attributes. Subsequently,
characters can be easily recognized by these attributes using a distance metric
and a complete lexicon that is encoded in attribute space. We evaluate the
proposed method on two open data sets: printed Chinese character recognition
for zero-shot learning, historical characters for few-shot learning and a
closed set: handwritten Chinese characters. Experimental results show a good
general classification of seen classes but also a very promising generalization
ability to unseen characters.

relativity has exercised investigators in the field since the inception of the
theory. Folklore has it that no adequate definition of a localized
gravitational stress-energetic quantity can be given. Most arguments to that
effect invoke one version or another of the Principle of Equivalence. I argue
that not only are such arguments of necessity vague and hand-waving but, worse,
are beside the point and do not address the heart of the issue. Based on a
novel analysis of what it may mean for one tensor to depend in the proper way
on another, which, \emph{en passant}, provides a precise characterization of
the idea of a `geometric object', I prove that, under certain natural
conditions, there can be no tensor whose interpretation could be that it
represents gravitational stress-energy in general relativity. It follows that
gravitational energy, such as it is in general relativity, is necessarily
non-local. Along the way, I prove a result of some interest in own right about
the structure of the associated jet bundles of the bundle of Lorentz metrics
over spacetime. I conclude by showing that my results also imply that, under a
few natural conditions, the Einstein field equation is the unique equation
relating gravitational phenomena to spatiotemporal structure, and discuss how
this relates to the non-localizability of gravitational stress-energy. The main
theorem proven underlying all the arguments is considerably stronger than the
standard result in the literature used for the same purposes (Lovelock's
theorem of 1972): it holds in all dimensions (not only in four); it does not
require an assumption about the differential order of the desired concomitant
of the metric; and it has a more natural physical interpretation.

magnitudes during the X-ray outbursts. Whether the extra light arises from the
X-ray heated outer disc, from the inner hot accretion flow, or from the jet is
currently debated. Optical polarisation measurements are able to distinguish
the relative contributions of these components. Methods. We present the results
of BVR polarisation measurements of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070
during the period of March-April 2018. Results. We detect small, $\sim$0.7%,
but statistically significant polarisation, part of which is of interstellar
origin. Depending on the interstellar polarisation estimate, the intrinsic
polarisation degree of the source is between $\sim$0.3% and 0.7%, and the
polarisation position angle is between $\sim10\deg-30\deg$. We show that the
polarisation increases after MJD 58222 (2018 April 14). The change is of the
order of 0.1% and is most pronounced in the R band. The change of the source
Stokes parameters occurs simultaneously with the drop of the observed V-band
flux and a slow softening of the X-ray spectrum. The Stokes vectors of
intrinsic polarisation before and after the drop are parallel, at least in the
V and R filters. Conclusions. We suggest that the increased polarisation is due
to the decreasing contribution of the non-polarized component, which we
associate with the the hot flow or jet emission. The low polarisation can
result from the tangled geometry of the magnetic field or from the Faraday
rotation in the dense, ionised, and magnetised medium close to the black hole.
The polarized optical emission is likely produced by the irradiated disc or by
scattering of its radiation in the optically thin outflow.

been investigated by several authors in the recent years. In particular, it has
been proved that every such ideal has a basis that can be twisted by the action
of the diagonal group into a Minkowski reduced basis for a well-rounded
lattice. We explicitly study such twists on the canonical bases of ideals,
which are especially important in arithmetic theory of quadratic number fields
and binary quadratic forms. Specifically, we prove that every fixed real
quadratic field has only finitely many ideals whose canonical basis can be
twisted into a well-rounded or a stable lattice in the plane. We demonstrate
some explicit examples of such twists. We also briefly discuss the relation
between stable and well-rounded twists of arbitrary ideal bases.

Learning resources typically target programmers who are learning programming
for the first time, or expert programmers for that language. An
underrepresented, yet important group of programmers are those that are
experienced in one programming language, but desire to author code in a
different language. For this scenario, we postulate that an effective form of
feedback is presented as a transfer from concepts in the first language to the
second. Current programming environments do not support this form of feedback.
  In this study, we apply the theory of learning transfer to teach a language
that programmers are less familiar with--such as R--in terms of a programming
language they already know--such as Python. We investigate learning transfer
using a new tool called Transfer Tutor that presents explanations for R code in
terms of the equivalent Python code. Our study found that participants
leveraged learning transfer as a cognitive strategy, even when unprompted.
Participants found Transfer Tutor to be useful across a number of affordances
like stepping through and highlighting facts that may have been missed or
misunderstood. However, participants were reluctant to accept facts without
code execution or sometimes had difficulty reading explanations that are
verbose or complex. These results provide guidance for future designs and
research directions that can support learning transfer when learning new
programming languages.

signals that match the activity period or its harmonics. However, not every
spectrograph includes Ca H & K, and redder activity indicators are needed for
planet searches around low-mass stars. Here we show how new activity indicators

$\epsilon$ Eri and $\alpha$ Cen B and use the results from both stars to
generate a master list of activity-sensitive lines whose core fluxes are
periodic at the star's rotation period. Our newly discovered activity
indicators can in turn be used as benchmarks to extend the list of known
activity-sensitive lines toward the infrared or UV. With recent improvements in
spectrograph illumination stabilization, wavelength calibration, and telluric

that takes advantage of the Cauchy distribution. Our test statistic has a very

accurate, but also as simple as the classic z-test or t-test, making our test
well suited for analyzing massive data. We further show that the power of the

natural language. Specifically, we implement two sequence-to-sequence neural
variational models - variational autoencoders (VAE) and variational
encoder-decoders (VED). VAEs for text generation are difficult to train due to
issues associated with the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term of the loss
function vanishing to zero. We successfully train VAEs by implementing
optimization heuristics such as KL weight annealing and word dropout. We also
demonstrate the effectiveness of this continuous latent space through
experiments such as random sampling, linear interpolation and sampling from the
neighborhood of the input. We argue that if VAEs are not designed
appropriately, it may lead to bypassing connections which results in the latent
space being ignored during training. We show experimentally with the example of
decoder hidden state initialization that such bypassing connections degrade the
VAE into a deterministic model, thereby reducing the diversity of generated
sentences. We discover that the traditional attention mechanism used in
sequence-to-sequence VED models serves as a bypassing connection, thereby
deteriorating the model's latent space. In order to circumvent this issue, we
propose the variational attention mechanism where the attention context vector
is modeled as a random variable that can be sampled from a distribution. We
show empirically using automatic evaluation metrics, namely entropy and
distinct measures, that our variational attention model generates more diverse
output sentences than the deterministic attention model. A qualitative analysis
with human evaluation study proves that our model simultaneously produces
sentences that are of high quality and equally fluent as the ones generated by
the deterministic attention counterpart.

magnetic moments order in antiparallel ferromagnetic planes characterized by a
normal axis. In such antiferromagnets, we predict that the magnetostrictive

higher derivative terms as small perturbations at low energies. Such an

combinations of two aspects, the resulting logic has the same desirable
algorithmic properties as plain LTL. In particular, the highly efficient
algorithmic backends that have been developed for LTL are also applicable to
these new logics. Finally, we discuss how to address all three aspects
simultaneously.

their success at the task of language modeling. However, modeling contexts in
very high dimensional space can lead to poor generalizability. We introduce the
Pyramidal Recurrent Unit (PRU), which enables learning representations in high
dimensional space with more generalization power and fewer parameters. PRUs
replace the linear transformation in LSTMs with more sophisticated interactions
including pyramidal and grouped linear transformations. This architecture gives
strong results on word-level language modeling while reducing the number of
parameters significantly. In particular, PRU improves the perplexity of a
recent state-of-the-art language model Merity et al. (2018) by up to 1.3 points
while learning 15-20% fewer parameters. For similar number of model parameters,
PRU outperforms all previous RNN models that exploit different gating
mechanisms and transformations. We provide a detailed examination of the PRU
and its behavior on the language modeling tasks. Our code is open-source and

and resilience of distribution systems. This paper proposes a distributionally
robust optimization (DRO) model for designing the topology of a new
distribution system facing random contingencies (e.g., imposed by natural
disasters). The proposed DRO model optimally configures the network topology
and integrates distributed generation to effectively meet the loads. Moreover,
we take into account the uncertainty of contingency. Using the moment
information of distribution line failures, we construct an ambiguity set of the
contingency probability distribution, and minimize the expected amount of load
shedding with regard to the worst-case distribution within the ambiguity set.
As compared with a classical robust optimization model, the DRO model
explicitly considers the contingency uncertainty and so provides a less
conservative configuration, yielding a better out-of-sample performance. We
recast the proposed model to facilitate the column-and-constraint generation
algorithm. We demonstrate the out-of-sample performance of the proposed
approach in numerical case studies.

approaching 10 $\mu$as in the best cases. Our full sample doubles the number of
radio pulsars with a reliable ($\gtrsim$5$\sigma$) model-independent distance

the solar neighbourhood, and so PSR$\pi$ brings a near-tenfold increase in the
number of pulsars with a reliable model-independent distance at $d>2$ kpc.
Using our sample along with previously published results, we show that even the
most recent models of the Galactic electron density distribution model contain
significant shortcomings, particularly at high Galactic latitudes. When
comparing our results to pulsar timing, two of the four millisecond pulsars in
our sample exhibit significant discrepancies in the estimates of proper motion
obtained by at least one pulsar timing array. With additional VLBI observations
to improve the absolute positional accuracy of our reference sources and an
expansion of the number of millisecond pulsars, we will be able to extend the
comparison of proper motion discrepancies to a larger sample of pulsar
reference positions, which will provide a much more sensitive test of the
applicability of the solar system ephemerides used for pulsar timing. Finally,
we use our large sample to estimate the typical accuracy attainable for
differential astrometry with the VLBA when observing pulsars, showing that for
sufficiently bright targets observed 8 times over 18 months, a parallax
uncertainty of 4 $\mu$as per arcminute of separation between the pulsar and

can be used to analyze intractable posterior distributions associated with
Bayesian hierarchical models. There are two standard versions of the Gibbs
sampler: The systematic scan (SS) version, where all variables are updated at
each iteration, and the random scan (RS) version, where a single, randomly
selected variable is updated at each iteration. The literature comparing the
theoretical properties of SS and RS Gibbs samplers is reviewed, and an
alternative hybrid scan Gibbs sampler is introduced, which is particularly well
suited to Bayesian models with latent variables. The word ""hybrid"" reflects the
fact that the scan used within this algorithm has both systematic and random
elements. Indeed, at each iteration, one updates the entire set of latent
variables, along with a randomly chosen block of the remaining variables. The
hybrid scan (HS) Gibbs sampler has important advantages over the two standard
scan Gibbs samplers. Firstly, the HS algorithm is often easier to analyze from
a theoretical standpoint. In particular, it can be much easier to establish the
geometric ergodicity of a HS Gibbs Markov chain than to do the same for the
corresponding SS and RS versions. Secondly, the sandwich methodology developed
in Hobert and Marchev (2008), which is also reviewed, can be applied to the HS
Gibbs algorithm (but not to the standard scan Gibbs samplers). It is shown
that, under weak regularity conditions, adding sandwich steps to the HS Gibbs
sampler always results in a theoretically superior algorithm. Three specific
Bayesian hierarchical models of varying complexity are used to illustrate the
results. One is a simple location-scale model for data from the Student's $t$
distribution, which is used as a pedagogical tool. The other two are
sophisticated, yet practical Bayesian regression models.

sample of galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digitial Sky Survey (SDSS). We draw our
sample of target galaxies from the spectroscopic catalogue of the SDSS, which
has redshift measurements for all its $\sim8\times10^5$ galaxies. We count the
neighbours from the photometric catalogue of the SDSS, which is a flux-limited
catalogue that has a photometric redshift estimation for all its
$\sim2\times10^8$ galaxies. The code counts the number (N) of galaxies within a
given 3D-distance from the target galaxy, using a database manager and a simple
decision tree. The 3D-distance is composed of a 2D projected distance on the
sky and a radial component, which is the difference between the spectroscopic
target redshift and the photometric redshift of the ""neighbour"" galaxies. As we
keep the search volume constant throughout the sample, N is a proxy for the
number density of galaxies around the target galaxies. We also present an
analysis of the preliminary results, showing the relation between N, the
inferred morphology and the dominant activity type of the target galaxies, as
well as the relation between N and the star formation history of the target
galaxies.

  Risk Assessment in Distribution Networks","10 pages, IEEE Trans on Power Systems, submitted",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the deployment of online monitoring systems in distribution networks,
massive amounts of data collected through them contains rich information on the
operating states of the networks. By leveraging the data, an unsupervised
approach based on bidirectional generative adversarial networks (BiGANs) is
proposed for operational risk assessment in distribution networks in this
paper. The approach includes two stages: (1) adversarial feature learning. The
most representative features are extracted from the online monitoring data and
a statistical index $\mathcal{N}_{\phi}$ is calculated for the features, during
which we make no assumptions or simplifications on the real data. (2)
operational risk assessment. The confidence level $1-\alpha$ for the population
mean of the standardized $\mathcal{N}_{\phi}$ is combined with the operational
risk levels which are divided into emergency, high risk, preventive and normal,
and the p value for each data point is calculated and compared with
$\frac{\alpha}{2}$ to determine the risk levels. The proposed approach is
capable of discovering the latent structure of the real data and providing more
accurate assessment result. The synthetic data is employed to illustrate the
selection of parameters involved in the proposed approach. Case studies on the
real-world online monitoring data validate the effectiveness and advantages of
the proposed approach in risk assessment.

drug delivery systems for paediatric and geriatric populations.
Multi-particulate oral dosage forms can offer significant benefits over
conventional capsules and tablets. This study proposes the use of an in vitro
model to quantitatively investigate the swallowing dynamics in presence of
multi-particulates. In vitro results were compared against sensory tests that
considered the attributes of ease of swallowing and post-swallow residues.
Water and hydrocolloids were considered as suspending vehicles, while the
suspended phase consisted of cellulose pellets of two different average sizes.
Both in vivo and in vitro tests reported easier swallow for smaller
multi-particulates. Besides, water thin liquids appeared not optimal for
complete oral clearance of the solids. The sensory study did not highlight
significant differences between the levels of thickness of the hydrocolloids.
Conversely, more discriminant results were obtained from in vitro tests,
suggesting that a minimum critical viscosity is necessary to enable a smooth
swallow, but increasing too much the carrier concentration affects swallowing
negatively. These results highlight the important interplay of particle size
and suspending vehicle rheology and the meaningful contribution that in vitro
methods can provide to pre-screening multi-particulate oral drug delivery
systems before sensory evaluation.

design which can tackle many drawbacks of relay systems in terms of complicated

circuit complexity of having one radio frequency (RF) chain dedicated to each
antenna element are prohibitive in practice. In this paper, we address this
critical issue in amplify-and-forward (AF) relay systems using a hybrid analog
and digital (A/D) transceiver structure. More specifically, leveraging the
channel long-term properties, we design the analog beamformer which aims to
minimize the channel estimation error and remain invariant over a long
timescale. Then, the beamforming is completed by simple digital signal
processing, i.e., maximum ratio combining/maximum ratio transmission (MRC/MRT)
or zero-forcing (ZF) in the baseband domain. We present analytical bounds on
the achievable spectral efficiency taking into account the spatial correlation
and imperfect channel state information at the relay station. Our analytical
results reveal that the hybrid A/D structure with ZF digital processor exploits
spatial correlation and offers a higher spectral efficiency compared to the
hybrid A/D structure with MRC/MRT scheme. Our numerical results showcase that
the hybrid A/D beamforming design captures nearly 95% of the spectral
efficiency of a fully digital AF relaying topology even by removing half of the
RF chains. It is also shown that the hybrid A/D structure is robust to coarse
quantization, and even with 2-bit resolution, the system can achieve more than
93% of the spectral efficiency offered by the same hybrid A/D topology with
infinite resolution phase shifters.

However, despite the high efficiency and accuracy of learning an embedding
model, people have little clue of what information about the original network
is preserved in the embedding vectors. The abstractness of low-dimensional
vector representation, stochastic nature of the construction process, and
non-transparent hyper-parameters all obscure understanding of network embedding
results. Visualization techniques have been introduced to facilitate embedding
vector inspection, usually by projecting the embedding space to a
two-dimensional display. Although the existing visualization methods allow
simple examination of the structure of embedding space, they cannot support
in-depth exploration of the embedding vectors. In this paper, we design an
exploratory visual analytics system that supports the comparative visual
interpretation of embedding vectors at the cluster, instance, and structural
levels. To be more specific, it facilitates comparison of what and how node
metrics are preserved across different embedding models and investigation of
relationships between node metrics and selected embedding vectors. Several case
studies confirm the efficacy of our system. Experts' feedback suggests that our

the irreducible elements. This theorem can be used to prove a set of objects

The universal bijection allows us to give some rigour to the idea of an

to embed an element of one Catalan family into one of a different family.
Multiplication on the right (respectively left) by the generator gives rise to
the right (respectively left) Narayana statistic. The statistic is invariant

model (SBM) is used to fit the observed network and the learnt parameters
indicate the group assignment, in which the parameters of model are often
calculated via an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and a belief
propagation (BP) algorithm is implemented to calculate the decomposition
itself. In the derivation process of the BP algorithm, some approximations were
made by omitting the effects of node's neighbors, the approximations do not
hold if networks are dense or some nodes holding large degrees. As a result,
for example, the BP algorithm cannot well detect CP structure in networks and
even yields wrong detection because the nodal degrees in core group are very
large. In doing so, we propose an improved BP algorithm to solve the problem in
the original BP algorithm without increasing any computational complexity. By
comparing the improved BP algorithm with the original BP algorithm on community
detection and CP detection, we find that the two algorithms yield the same
performance on the community detection when the network is sparse, for the
community structure in dense networks or CP structure in networks, our improved
BP algorithm is much better and more stable. The improved BP algorithm may help
us correctly partition different types of meso-scale structures in networks.

We find that no evolution in the normalization of the MZR is obtained unless we
introduce an explicit scaling of the reheated and ejected mass with redshift as
$(1+z)^\beta$. The latter is in agreement with results from the FIRE
simulations, and it should encompass small scale properties of the interstellar
medium varying over time, which are not captured in SAMs, as well as other
energy sources in addition to SNe. Increasing $\beta$ leads to stronger
evolution of the MZR normalization; $\beta = 1.9$ reproduces the observed MZR
in the range $0 < z < 3.5$. A stronger redshift dependence of outflows reduces
the levels of star formation at earlier epochs with the consequent decrease of
metal production. This leads to a slower increase of the gas metallicity
compared to the stellar mass build-up. The cold gas can be contaminated either
by receiving a direct injection of the material recycled by stellar winds and
SNe or by gas cooling. The relative role of each process for a given stellar

Owing to the severity of these threats, a variety of security techniques are
available. However, no single technique can address the whole spectrum of
cyber-attacks that may be launched by a determined and resourceful attacker. In
light of this, we consider a multi-pronged approach for designing secure and
resilient IIoT systems, which integrates redundancy, diversity, and hardening
techniques. We introduce a framework for quantifying cyber-security risks and
optimizing IIoT design by determining security investments in redundancy,
diversity, and hardening. To demonstrate the applicability of our framework, we
present two case studies in water distribution and transportation a case study
in water-distribution systems. Our numerical evaluation shows that integrating
redundancy, diversity, and hardening can lead to reduced security risk at the
same cost.

dictates the transfer of fermions between the Weyl fermions with opposite

demonstrate that quantum steerability of the state increases for a specific
range of height $h$ and then gradually approaches a finite value with further
increasing height of the satellite's orbit. Comparing with the peak frequency
parameter, the Gaussian steering changes more for different squeezing

asymmetry between the photon pairs. In addition, we find that the influence of

pathway to accurately and efficiently compute the absolute binding free energy
of receptor-ligand complex. Currently, the double decoupling method (DDM) and
the potential of mean force approach (PMF) methods are widely used to compute
the absolute binding free energy of biomolecules. The DDM relies on
alchemically decoupling the ligand from its environments, which can be
computationally challenging for large ligands and charged ligands because of
the large magnitude of the decoupling free energies involved. On the other
hand, the PMF approach uses physical pathway to extract the ligand out of the
binding site, thus avoids the alchemical decoupling of the ligand. However, the
PMF method has its own drawback because of the reliance on a ligand
binding/unbinding pathway free of steric obstruction from the receptor atoms.
Therefore, in the presence of deeply buried ligand functional groups the
convergence of the PMF calculation can be very slow leading to large errors in
the computed binding free energy. Here we develop a new method called AlchemPMF
by combining alchemical transformation with physical pathway to overcome the
major drawback in the PMF method. We have tested the new approach on the
binding of a charged ligand to an allosteric site on HIV-1 Integrase. After 20
ns of simulation per umbrella sampling window, the new method yields absolute
binding free energies within ~1 kcal/mol from the experimental result, whereas
the standard PMF approach and the DDM calculations result in errors of ~5
kcal/mol and > 2 kcal/mol, respectively. Furthermore, the binding free energy

  Stem Cells in tumor progression",,,,,"q-bio.MN q-bio.CB","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Purpose of review: The epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and the
generation of Cancer Stem Cells (CSC) are two fundamental aspects contributing
to tumor growth, acquisition of resistance to therapy, formation of metastases,
and tumor relapse. Recent experimental data identifying the circuits regulating
EMT and CSCs have driven the development of computational models capturing the
dynamics of these circuits and consequently various aspects of tumor
progression. Recent findings: We review the contribution made by these models
in a) recapitulating experimentally observed behavior, b) making experimentally
testable predictions, and c) driving emerging notions in the field, including
the emphasis on the aggressive potential of hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M)
phenotype(s). We discuss dynamical and statistical models at intracellular and
population level relating to dynamics of EMT and CSCs, and those focusing on
interconnections between these two processes. Summary: These models highlight
the insights gained via mathematical modeling approaches, and emphasizes that
the connections between hybrid E/M phenotype(s) and stemness can be explained
by analyzing underlying regulatory circuits. Such experimentally curated models
have the potential of serving as platforms for better therapeutic design
strategies.

contributor to the burden of disease in China. China is the most populous
country in the world and also has the largest number of air pollution deaths
per year, yet the spatial resolution of existing national air pollution
estimates for China is generally relatively low. We address this knowledge gap
by developing and evaluating national empirical models for China incorporating
land-use regression (LUR), satellite measurements, and universal kriging (UK).
We test the resulting models in several ways, including (1) comparing models
developed using forward stepwise regression vs. partial least squares (PLS)
regression, (2) comparing models developed with and without satellite
measurements, and with and without UK, and (3) 10-fold cross-validation (CV),
leave-one-province-out(LOPO) CV, and leave-one-city-out(LOCO) CV. Satellite
data and kriging are complementary in making predictions more accurate: kriging
improved the models in well-sampled areas; satellite data substantially
improved performance at locations far away from monitors. Stepwise forward
selection performs similarly to PLS in 10-fold CV, but better than PLS in
LOPO-CV. Our best models employ forward selection and UK, with 10-fold CV R2 of
0.89 (for both 2014 and 2015) for PM2.5 and of 0.73 (year-2014) and 0.78
(year-2015) for NO2. Population-weighted concentrations during 2014-2015
decreased for PM2.5 (58.7 {\mu}g/m3 to 52.3 {\mu}g/m3) and NO2 (29.6 {\mu}g/m3
to 26.8 {\mu}g/m3). We produced the first high resolution national LUR models
for annual-average concentrations in China. Models were applied on 1 km grid to
support future research. In 2015, more than 80% of the Chinese population lived
in areas that exceed the Chinese national PM2.5 standard, 35 {\mu}g/m3. Results
here will be publicly available and may be useful for environmental health

understand the properties of these algorithms, the experimenter needs
high-confidence estimates of the accuracy of the learned value functions. For
environments with small, finite state-spaces, like chains, the true value
function can be easily computed, to compute accuracy. For large, or continuous

the largely open problem of how to obtain these high-confidence estimates, for

design an offline sampling algorithm, which stores the required quantities to
repeatedly compute value error estimates for any learned value function. We

averaged center of mass momentum approximation has been used. We derive in
detail the exact expressions of the angular integrations of the momentum
$\bm{P}$ within relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (RBHF) theory, especially
for the case of asymmetric nuclear matter. In order to assess the reliability
of the conventional average momentum approximation for the binding energy, the
saturation properties of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter are
systematically investigated based on the realistic Bonn nucleon-nucleon
potential. It is found that the exact treatment of the center of mass momentum
leads to non-negligible contributions to the higher order physical quantities.
The correlation between the symmetry energy $E_{\mathrm{sym}}$, the slope
parameter $L$, and the curvature $K_{\mathrm{sym}}$ of the symmetry energy are
investigated. The results of our RBHF calculations for the bulk parameters
characterizing the equation of state are compared with recent constraints

Standard methods, eg the $k$-means method, usually require solving a non-convex
optimization problem. Recently, total variation based convex relaxation to the
$k$-means model has emerged as an attractive alternative for data clustering.
However, the existing results on its exact clustering property, ie, the
condition imposed on data so that the method can provably give correct
identification of all cluster memberships, is only applicable to very specific
data and is also much more restrictive than that of some other methods. This
paper aims at the revisit of total variation based convex clustering, by
proposing a weighted sum-of-$\ell_1$-norm relating convex model. Its exact
clustering property established in this paper, in both deterministic and
probabilistic context, is applicable to general data and is much sharper than
the existing results. These results provided good insights to advance the
research on convex clustering. Moreover, the experiments also demonstrated that
the proposed convex model has better empirical performance when be compared to
standard clustering methods, and thus it can see its potential in practice.

with previous density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of the

two thermodynamic paths to access this regime clarifies both the numerical and

cognitive action contains a potential and a kinetic term that nicely resemble
the classic formulation of regularization in machine learning. A special choice
of the functional index, which leads to forth-order differential

This principle is applied by allocating individuals to intervention if the test

to a control if the result is negative (or on the other side of the threshold).
This can also be done with different dichotomizing thresholds for one test. The
frequencies of the outcome in those with each of the four resulting
observations are then used to calculate the risk ratio (RR) for the marginal
probabilities by solving simultaneous equations. This assumes that the RR due
to intervention compared to control is the same in both test groups created by
randomization. The calculations are illustrated by using data from a randomized
controlled trial (RCT) that assessed the efficacy of an angiotensin receptor

that consist of a small number of materials, which makes it possible to compute
accurate reconstructions from highly limited projection data. For cases where
the allowed intensity values in the reconstruction are known a priori, the
discrete algebraic reconstruction technique (DART) has shown to yield accurate
reconstructions from few projections. However, a key limitation is that the
benefit of DART diminishes as the number of different materials increases. Many
tomographic imaging techniques can simultaneously record tomographic data at
multiple channels, each corresponding to a different weighting of the materials
in the object. Whenever projection data from more than one channel is
available, this additional information can potentially be exploited by the
reconstruction algorithm. In this paper we present Multi-Channel DART
(MC-DART), which deals effectively with multi-channel data. This class of
algorithms is a generalization of DART to multiple channels and combines the
information for each separate channel-reconstruction in a multi-channel

very rich, ranging from fully integrable to chaotic as one changes the values

infinite-dimensional resonant systems, which are mathematically a highly
special case of two-body interaction Hamiltonians (extensively researched in
condensed matter, nuclear and high-energy physics). Despite the complexity of
the corresponding classical dynamics, the quantum version turns out to be
remarkably simple: the Hamiltonian is block-diagonal in the Fock basis, with
all blocks of varying finite sizes. Being solvable in terms of diagonalizing
finite numerical matrices, these systems are thus arguably the simplest
interacting quantum field theories known to man. We demonstrate how to perform
the diagonalization in practice, and study both numerical patterns emerging for
the integrable cases, and the spectral statistics, which efficiently
distinguishes the special integrable cases from generic (chaotic) points in the
parameter space. We discuss a range of potential applications in view of the

such as machine-type communication (MTC) services along with conventional
human-type communication (HTC) services. This requires base stations to serve a
large number of devices in relatively short channel coherence intervals, which
renders allocation of orthogonal pilot sequences per-device in each cell
impractical. Furthermore, the stringent power constraints, place-and-play type
connectivity and various data rate requirements of MTC devices make it
impossible for the traditional cellular architecture to accommodate MTC and HTC
services together. Massive multiple-input-multiple-output (mMIMO) technology
has the potential to allow the coexistence of HTC and MTC services, thanks to
its inherent spatial multiplexing properties and low transmission power
requirements. In this work, we first tackle the optimal non-orthogonal pilot
design problem and demonstrate that the optimal pilot sequences are Welch bound
equality sequences. In the second part, we investigate the performance of a
single cell under a shared physical channel assumption for MTC and HTC services
and propose a novel scheme for sharing the time-frequency resources. The
analysis reveals that mMIMO can significantly enhance the performance of such a
setup and allow the inclusion of MTC services into the cellular networks
without requiring additional resources.

recognition. Most of multi- lingual systems rests on specialized models that
are trained on a single language and one of them is selected at test time.
While some recognition systems are based on a unified optical model, dealing
with a unified language model remains a major issue, as traditional language
models are generally trained on corpora composed of large word lexicons per
language. Here, we bring a solution by con- sidering language models based on
sub-lexical units, called multigrams. Dealing with multigrams strongly reduces
the lexicon size and thus decreases the language model complexity. This makes
pos- sible the design of an end-to-end unified multilingual recognition system
where both a single optical model and a single language model are trained on
all the languages. We discuss the impact of the language unification on each
model and show that our system reaches state-of-the-art methods perfor- mance

Flux ratios between close pairs of images of lensed quasars can be used to
constrain the accretion disc size and temperature profile. The starting point
of any microlensing model is the macromodel of the lens, which provides the
convergence and shear values at the location of the multiple images. Here I
present a new approach of microlensing modelling independently of the
macromodel of the lens. The technique is applied to the close pair of images A1

respect to wavelength. The inferred accretion disc size and temperature profile
measurements, as well as the smooth matter fraction at the location of the
images, are quite robust under a wide range of macromodel variations. A case of
using purely microlensing data (flux ratios) to constrain the macromodel is
also presented. This is a first application of the technique on a fiducial
system and set of flux ratios; the method is readily applicable to collections
of such objects and can be extended to light curve and/or imaging data.

are identified with kinematic distances from 2.4 kpc to 11 kpc. Based on the
spatial and velocity distribution, nine individual clouds, C1-C9, have been

other clouds in the RMC complex in view of its characteristic velocity,
excitation temperature, and velocity dispersion. Most of the young stellar
clusters in the region are located in positions of both high column density and
high excitation temperature. Seven new molecular filaments are discovered in

outperforms the corresponding balanced and uniform random sampling designs for

a case study applying our new sampling design to plan a survey for species

fluctuations $n_{\rm s}$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model have excluded the minimal
scale-invariant Harrison-Zel'dovich model ($n_{\rm s}=1$; hereafter HZ) at high
significance, providing support for inflation. In recent years, however, some
tensions have emerged between different cosmological datasets that, if not due
to systematics, could indicate the presence of new physics beyond the
$\Lambda$CDM model. In the light of these developments, we evaluate the
Bayesian evidence against HZ in different data combinations and model
extensions. Considering only the Planck temperature data, we find inconclusive
evidence against HZ when including variations in the neutrino number $N_{\rm
eff}$ and/or the Helium abundance $Y_{\rm He}$. Adding the Planck polarization
data, on the other hand, yields strong evidence against HZ in the extensions we
considered. Perhaps most interestingly, Planck temperature data combined with
local measurements of the Hubble constant give as the most probable model an HZ
spectrum, with additional neutrinos. However, with the inclusion of
polarisation, standard $\Lambda$CDM is once again preferred, but the HZ model
with extra neutrinos is not strongly disfavored. The possibility of fully
ruling out the HZ spectrum is therefore ultimately connected with the solution
to current tensions between cosmological datasets. If these tensions are
confirmed by future data, then new physical mechanisms could be at work and an
HZ spectrum could still offer a valid alternative.

regression, or deep robust regression. Traditionally, deep regression employs
the L2 loss function, known to be sensitive to outliers, i.e. samples that
either lie at an abnormal distance away from the majority of the training
samples, or that correspond to wrongly annotated targets. This means that,
during back-propagation, outliers may bias the training process due to the high
magnitude of their gradient. In this paper, we propose DeepGUM: a deep
regression model that is robust to outliers thanks to the use of a
Gaussian-uniform mixture model. We derive an optimization algorithm that
alternates between the unsupervised detection of outliers using
expectation-maximization, and the supervised training with cleaned samples
using stochastic gradient descent. DeepGUM is able to adapt to a continuously
evolving outlier distribution, avoiding to manually impose any threshold on the
proportion of outliers in the training set. Extensive experimental evaluations
on four different tasks (facial and fashion landmark detection, age and head
pose estimation) lead us to conclude that our novel robust technique provides
reliability in the presence of various types of noise and protection against a
high percentage of outliers.

concurrent and multi-agent systems. The basic idea is that concurrent processes
(agents) can be understood as corresponding to players in a game; plays
represent the possible computation runs of the system; and strategies define
the behaviour of agents. Typically, strategies are modelled as functions from
sequences of system states to player actions. Analysing a system in such a
setting involves computing the set of (Nash) equilibria in the concurrent game.
However, we show that, with respect to the above model of strategies (arguably,
the ""standard"" model in the computer science literature), bisimilarity does not
preserve the existence of Nash equilibria. Thus, two concurrent games which are
behaviourally equivalent from a semantic perspective, and which from a logical
perspective satisfy the same temporal logic formulae, may nevertheless have
fundamentally different properties (solutions) from a game theoretic
perspective. Our aim in this paper is to explore the issues raised by this
discovery. After illustrating the issue by way of a motivating example, we
present three models of strategies with respect to which the existence of Nash
equilibria is preserved under bisimilarity. We use some of these models of
strategies to provide new semantic foundations for logics for strategic
reasoning, and investigate restricted scenarios where bisimilarity can be shown
to preserve the existence of Nash equilibria with respect to the conventional
model of strategies in the computer science literature.

advertisers to their customers. However, targeted advertising can also be
abused by malicious advertisers to efficiently reach people susceptible to
false stories, stoke grievances, and incite social conflict. Since targeted ads
are not seen by non-targeted and non-vulnerable people, malicious ads are
likely to go unreported and their effects undetected. This work examines a
specific case of malicious advertising, exploring the extent to which political
ads from the Russian Intelligence Research Agency (IRA) run prior to 2016 U.S.
elections exploited Facebook's targeted advertising infrastructure to
efficiently target ads on divisive or polarizing topics (e.g., immigration,
race-based policing) at vulnerable sub-populations. In particular, we do the
following: (a) We conduct U.S. census-representative surveys to characterize
how users with different political ideologies report, approve, and perceive
truth in the content of the IRA ads. Our surveys show that many ads are
""divisive"": they elicit very different reactions from people belonging to
different socially salient groups. (b) We characterize how these divisive ads
are targeted to sub-populations that feel particularly aggrieved by the status
quo. Our findings support existing calls for greater transparency of content
and targeting of political ads. (c) We particularly focus on how the Facebook
ad API facilitates such targeting. We show how the enormous amount of personal
data Facebook aggregates about users and makes available to advertisers enables
such malicious targeting.

diffusion limited aggregation (IDLA) model. In both processes $n$ particles
start from an arbitrary but fixed origin. Each particle performs a simple
random walk until first encountering an unoccupied vertex, and at which point
the vertex becomes occupied and the random walk terminates. In one of the
processes, called \textit{Sequential-IDLA}, only one particle moves until
settling and only then does the next particle start whereas in the second
process, called \textit{Parallel-IDLA}, all unsettled particles move
simultaneously. Our main goal is to analyze the so-called dispersion time of
these processes, which is the maximum number of steps performed by any of the
$n$ particles.
  In order to compare the two processes, we develop a coupling which shows the
dispersion time of the Parallel-IDLA stochastically dominates that of the
Sequential-IDLA; however, the total number of steps performed by all particles
has the same distribution in both processes. This coupling also gives us that
dispersion time of Parallel-IDLA is bounded in expectation by dispersion time
of the Sequential-IDLA up to a multiplicative $\log n$ factor. Moreover, we
derive asymptotic upper and lower bound on the dispersion time for several
graph classes, such as cliques, cycles, binary trees, $d$-dimensional grids,
hypercubes and expanders. Most of our bounds are tight up to a multiplicative
constant.

collection of subsets $E(H) \subseteq 2^{V(H)}$ which we consider as partition
of unity relations between projection operators. These partition of unity
relations freely generate a universal C*-algebra, which we call the ""free
hypergraph C*-algebra"" $C^*(H)$. General free hypergraph C*-algebras were first
studied in the context of quantum contextuality. As special cases, the class of
free hypergraph C*-algebras comprises quantum permutation groups, maximal group
C*-algebras of graph products of finite cyclic groups, and the C*-algebras
associated to quantum graph homomorphism, isomorphism, and colouring.
  Here, we conduct the first systematic study of aspects of free hypergraph
C*-algebras. We show that they coincide with the class of finite colimits of
finite-dimensional commutative C*-algebras, and also with the class of
C*-algebras associated to synchronous nonlocal games. We had previously shown
that it is undecidable to determine whether $C^*(H)$ is nonzero for given $H$.
We now show that it is also undecidable to determine whether a given $C^*(H)$
is residually finite-dimensional, and similarly whether it only has
infinite-dimensional representations, and whether it has a tracial state. It
follows that for each one of these properties, there is $H$ such that the
question whether $C^*(H)$ has this property is independent of the ZFC axioms,
assuming that these are consistent. We clarify some of the subtleties
associated with such independence results in an appendix.

organization via transport of large intracellular cargo. While passive
diffusion is often sufficiently fast for the transport of smaller cargo, active
transport is necessary to organize large structures on short timescales. The
main mechanism of this transport is by cargo attachment to motors which walk in
a directed fashion along intracellular filaments. There are a number of models
which seek to describe the motion of motors with attached cargo, from detailed
microscopic to coarse phenomenological descriptions. We focus on the
intermediate-detailed discrete stochastic hopping models, and explore how cargo
transport changes depending on the number of motors, motor interaction, system
constraints and rate formulations which are derived from common thermodynamic
assumptions. We find that, despite obeying the same detailed balance
constraint, the choice of rate formulation considerably affects the
characteristics of the overall motion of the system, with one rate formulation
exhibiting novel behavior of loaded motor groups moving faster than a single

respect to both $d^{(s)}$ and $d_{w_\delta}$ and we study the asymptotic

number of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow spectra at redshifts z~2-3, detected
through their rest-frame UV absorption lines. In rare cases, lines of
vibrationally excited states of H_2 can be detected in the same spectra. The
connection between afterglow line-of-sight absorption properties of molecular
(and atomic) gas, and the observed behaviour in emission of similar sources at
low redshift, is an important test of the suitability of GRB afterglows as
general probes of conditions in star formation regions at high redshift.
Recently, emission lines of carbon monoxide have been detected in a small
sample of GRB host galaxies, at sub-mm wavelengths, but no searches for H_2 in
emission have been reported yet. In this paper we perform an exploratory search
for rest-frame K band rotation-vibrational transitions of H_2 in emission,
observable only in the lowest redshift GRB hosts (z<0.22). Searching the data
of four host galaxies, we detect a single significant rotation-vibrational H_2
line candidate, in the host of GRB 031203. Re-analysis of Spitzer mid-infrared
spectra of the same GRB host gives a single low significance rotational line
candidate. The (limits on) line flux ratios are consistent with those of blue
compact dwarf galaxies in the literature. New instrumentation, in particular on
the JWST and the ELT, can facilitate a major increase in our understanding of
the H_2 properties of nearby GRB hosts, and the relation to H_2 absorption in
GRBs at higher redshift.

which hosts a prominent cool core and exhibits a signature of a major merger.
We present the first direct observational evidence for sub-sonic nature of
sloshing motion of the cool core. We find that a residual X-ray image from the
Chandra X-ray Observatory after removing the global emission shows a clear
dipolar pattern characteristic of gas sloshing, whereas we find no significant
residual in the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) image from the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We estimate the equation of state of
perturbations in the gas from the X-ray and SZE residual images. The inferred
velocity is 420 +310 -420 km s-1, which is much lower than the adiabatic sound
speed of the intracluster medium in the core. We thus conclude that the
perturbation is nearly isobaric, and gas sloshing motion is consistent with
being in pressure equilibrium. Next, we report evidence for gas stripping of an
infalling subcluster, which likely shock-heats gas to high temperature well in
excess of 20 keV. Using mass distribution inferred from strong lensing images
of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we find that the mass peak is located away
from the peak position of stripped gas with statistical significance of >
5{\sigma}. Unlike for the gas sloshing, the velocity inferred from the equation
of state of the excess hot gas is comparable to the adiabatic sound speed
expected for the 20 keV intracluster medium. All of the results support that
the southeast substructure is created by a merger. On the other hand, the
positional offset between the mass and the gas limits the self-interaction
cross section of dark matter to be less than 3.7 h-1 cm2 g-1 (95% CL).

improved lattice QCD with Wilson quarks. Our strategy is based on the chirally
rotated Schr\""odinger functional and can be generalized to other finite (ratios
of) renormalization constants which are traditionally obtained by imposing
continuum chiral Ward identities as normalization conditions. Compared to the
latter we achieve an error reduction up to one order of magnitude. Our results
have already enabled the setting of the scale for the $N_{\rm f}=2+1$ CLS

the strategy and present our results for both $N_{\rm f}=2$ and $N_{\rm f}=3$

important role within telecommunication services, which were previously

it enables faster introduction of new telecom services, combined with an agile

allowing service providers to adequately design, test and evaluate services
before they are deployed in production and also update them during their
lifetime. This continuous cycle between development and operations, a concept
known as DevOps, is a well known strategy in software development. To extend
its context further to SDN/NFV-based services, the functionalities provided by
traditional cloud platforms are not yet sufficient. By giving an overview of
the currently available tools and their limitations, the gaps in DevOps for

a secure content delivery network service (enhanced with deep packet inspection

2010-2011 using the Global Millimeter VLBI Array. The survey data attained a
typical baseline sensitivity of 0.1 Jy and a typical image sensitivity of 5
mJy/beam, providing successful detections and images for all of the survey

represent the structure of the sources. The Gaussian model-fit-based estimates
of brightness temperature ($T_\mathrm{b}$) at the jet base (core) and in moving

intrinsic value of brightness temperature, $T_\mathrm{0}$, is applied to
reproduce the observed $T_\mathrm{b}$ distribution. It yields $T_\mathrm{0} =
(3.77^{+0.10}_{-0.14}) \times 10^{11}\,$K for the jet cores, implying that the
inverse Compton losses dominate the emission. In the jet components,
$T_\mathrm{0} =(1.42^{+0.16}_{-0.19})\times 10^{11}\,$K is found, slightly
higher than the equipartition limit of $\sim5\times 10^{10}\,$K expected for

logarithmically divergent shift, the optimal transport maps are close to be the
identity at every scale. These bounds allow us to pass to the limit as the
system size goes to infinity and construct a locally optimal coupling between
the Lebesgue measure and the Poisson point process which retains the
stationarity properties of the Poisson point process only at the level of
second-order differences. Our quantitative bounds are obtained through a
Campanato iteration scheme based on a deterministic and a stochastic
ingredient. The deterministic part, which can be seen as our main contribution,
is a regularity result for Monge-Amp\`ere equations with rough right-hand side.
Since we believe that it could be useful in other contexts, we prove it for
general space dimensions. The stochastic part is a concentration result for the
optimal matching problem which builds on previous work by Ambrosio, Stra and

based on introducing the transition matrix in the energy space (TMES). The TMES
fully describes a random walk in the energy space biased with the Wang-Landau
probability. Properties of the TMES can explain some features of the
Wang-Landau algorithm, for example, the flatness of the histogram. We show that
the Wang--Landau probability with the true DOS generates a Markov process in
the energy space and the inverse spectral gap of the TMES can estimate the
mixing time of this Markov process. We argue that an efficient implementation
of the Wang-Landau algorithm consists of two simulation stages: the original
Wang-Landau procedure for the first stage and a $1/t$ modification for the
second stage. The mixing time determines the characteristic time for
convergence to the true DOS in the second simulation stage. The parameter of
the convergence of the estimated DOS to the true DOS is the difference of the
largest TMES eigenvalue from unity. The characteristic time of the first stage
is the tunneling time, i.e., the time needed for the system to visit all energy
levels.

Estimates of the annual seal pup production are critical factors in the

estimate the total seal pup production, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical
modeling approach motivated by viewing the seal pup appearances as a

stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) module of the integrated nested

improves local estimation performance, and that the increased prediction

This suggests that the sampling density of the survey design may not be

from recent {\tt NNFF1.0} analysis of charged hadron FFs, we determine the
small but efficient {\it residual} charged hadron FFs from QCD analysis of all
available single inclusive unidentified charged hadron data sets in
electron-positron ($e^+ e^-$) annihilations. The zero-mass variable flavor
number scheme (ZM-VFNS) has been applied to account the heavy flavor
contributions. The obtained optimum set of {\it residual} charged hadron FFs is
accompanied by the well-known Hessian technique to assess the uncertainties in
the extraction of these new sets of FFs. It is shown that the {\it residual}
contributions of charged hadron FFs have very important impact on the inclusive
charged hadron FFs and substantially on the quality and the reliability of the
QCD fit. Furthermore, this study shows that the {\it residual} contributions
become also sizable for the case of heavy quark FFs as well as for the $c$- and
$b$-tagged cross sections.

periods between 2015 and 2017 to demonstrate which features degrade in
performance the most due to concept drift. Our models can classify news
articles into communities with high accuracy, ranging from 0.81 ROC AUC to 1.0

news articles with high accuracy, practitioners should approach these models
carefully. Predictions are both community-pair dependent and feature group
dependent. Moreover, these feature groups generalize over time differently,
with some only degrading slightly over time, but others degrading greatly.
Therefore, we recommend that community-interest predictions are done in a
hierarchical structure, where multiple binary classifiers can be used to
separate community pairs, rather than a traditional multi-class model. Second,
these models should be retrained over time based on accuracy goals and the

of well-known distance functions between probability distributions supported on

an SC case study in which our numerical experiments suggest a significant
improvement in the cross domain classification error in comparison with a
random selected source domain for both a naive and adaptive learning setting.
In the case of more heterogeneous datasets, the predictability feature of the
proposed model can be utilized to further select a subset of candidate domains,
where the corresponding classifier outperforms the one trained on all available

Multiplexing is assumed, where each orthogonal transmission occurs during a
time-slot. Sources transmit in turns in consecutive time slots during the first
transmission phase. During the second phase, the destination schedules in each
time-slot one node (source or relay) to transmit redundancies based on its
correctly decoded source messages (its decoding set) with the goal to maximize
the average spectral efficiency. Bidirectional limited control channels are
available from sources and relays towards the destination to implement the
necessary control signaling of the HARQ protocols. Among the three proposed
HARQ, two follow the Incremental Redundancy (IR) approach. One consists in
sending incremental redundancies on all the messages from the scheduled node
decoding set (Multi-User encoding) while the other one helps a single source
(Single User encoding) chosen randomly. The third one is of the Chase Combining
(CC) type, where the selected node repeats the transmission (including
modulation and coding scheme) of one source chosen randomly from its decoding
set. Monte-Carlo simulations confirm that the IR-type of HARQ with Multi-User
encoding offers the best performance, followed by IR-type of HARQ with Single
User encoding and CC-type of HARQ. We conclude that IR-type of HARQ with Single
User encoding offers the best trade-off between performance and complexity for

quantum walks is implemented via birefringent crystal collinearly cut based on
time-multiplexing scheme. Our protocol is compact and avoids extra loss, making
it suitable for realizing genuine single-photon quantum walks at a large-scale.
By adopting heralded single-photon as the walker and with a high time
resolution technology in single-photon detection, we carry out a 50-step
Hadamard discrete-time quantum walk with high fidelity up to 0.948$\pm$0.007.
Particularly, we can reconstruct the complete wave-function of the walker that
starts the walk in a single lattice site through local tomography of each site.
Through a Fourier transform, the wave-function in quasi-momentum space can be
obtained. With this ability, we propose and report a method to reconstruct the
eigenvectors of the system Hamiltonian in quasi-momentum space and directly
read out the winding numbers in different topological phases (trivial and
non-trivial) in the presence of chiral symmetry. By introducing nonequivalent
time-frames, we show that the whole topological phases in periodically driven
system can also be characterized by two different winding numbers. Our method
can also be extended to the high winding number situation.

features not encountered in the trace theory of bounded Lipschitz domains or

splits into two infinite disconnected components. The traces onto each

term that measures the difference between the two traces. Second, as in the
usual trace theory, there is a term in the seminorm measuring the fractional
Sobolev regularity of the trace functions with a difference quotient integral.
However, the finite width of the strip-like domain gives rise to a screening
effect that bounds the range of the difference quotient perturbation. The
screened homogeneous fractional Sobolev spaces defined by this screened

obtain the internal energy and from that the Helmholtz free energy. The
reflecting wall is modelled by assuming the Dirichlet or the Neumann boundary
conditions on the wall. It is found that when $N>2$ integration over space
eliminates dependence on the curvature coupling parameter $\xi$. Unexpectedly
though, when $N=2$, the internal energy and the corresponding thermodynamics
turn out to be dependent on $\xi$. For instance, the correction to the
two-dimensional Planckian heat capacity is $\mp \xi k_{B}$ (minus for
Dirichlet, plus for Neumann). Other aspects of this dependence on $\xi$ are

immaculacy and provides an explanation of some of these linear strata.

end of the last ice age (past 21,000 years), so that we might understand
whether and how existing ice sheets may reduce or disappear under climate
change. Though ice sheet models have a few parameters controlling physical
behaviour of the ice mass, they also require boundary conditions for climate
(spatio-temporal fields of temperature and precipitation, typically on regular
grids and at monthly intervals). The behaviour of the ice sheet is highly
sensitive to these fields, and there is relatively little data from geological
records to constrain them as the land was covered with ice. We develop a
methodology for generating a range of plausible boundary conditions, using a
low-dimensional basis representation of the spatio-temporal input. We derive
this basis by combining key patterns, extracted from a small ensemble of
climate model simulations of the deglaciation, with sparse spatio-temporal
observations. By jointly varying the ice sheet parameters and basis vector
coefficients, we run ensembles of the Glimmer ice sheet model that
simultaneously explore both climate and ice sheet model uncertainties. We use
these to calibrate the ice sheet physics and boundary conditions for Glimmer,
by ruling out regions of the joint coefficient and parameter space via history
matching. We use binary ice/no ice observations from reconstructions of past
ice sheet margin position to constrain this space by introducing a novel metric
for history matching to binary data.

a rapid thermal quench from the liquid state across the glass transition and
allowed to phase separate and solidify at constant volume, thus producing an
extended porous network in an amorphous solid. We find that under periodic
shear, the potential energy decreases over consecutive cycles due to gradual
rearrangement of the glassy material, and the minimum of the potential energy
after thousands of shear cycles is lower at larger strain amplitudes. Moreover,
with increasing cycle number, the pore size distributions become more skewed
toward larger length scales where a distinct peak is developed and the peak
intensity is enhanced at larger strain amplitudes. The numerical analysis of
the local density distribution functions demonstrates that cyclic loading leads
to formation of higher density solid domains and homogenization of the glass

respectively. In spite of these strong constraints, however, we also point out
that the analysis of strong lensing using a simplified single isothermal sphere
(SIS) model for the lens produces some irreducible scatter in the inferred CDD
data. The use of an extended SIS approximation, with a power-law density
structure, yields very similar results, but does not lessen the scatter due to
its larger number of free parameters, which weakens the best-fit constraints.
Future work with these strong lenses should therefore be based on more detailed
ray-tracing calculations to determine the mass distribution more precisely.

numbers in a two-dimensional ""diamond-octagon"" lattice model comprising two
kinds of elementary plaquette geometries, diamond and octagon, respectively. We
show that the origin of such nontrivial topological nearly flat bands can be
described by a short-ranged tight-binding Hamiltonian. By considering an
additional diagonal hopping parameter in the diamond plaquettes along with an
externally fine-tuned magnetic flux, it leads to the emergence of such nearly
flat band states with nonzero Chern numbers for our simple lattice model. Such
topologically nontrivial nearly flat bands can be very useful to realize the
fractional topological phenomena in lattice models when the interaction is
taken into consideration. In addition, we also show that perfect band
flattening for certain energy bands, leading to compact localized states can be
accomplished by fine-tuning the parameters of the Hamiltonian of the system. We
compute the density of states and the wavefunction amplitude distribution at
different lattice sites to corroborate the formation of such perfectly flat
band states in the energy spectrum. Considering the structural homology between
a diamond-octagon lattice and a kagome lattice, we strongly believe that one
can experimentally realize a diamond-octagon lattice using ultracold quantum
gases in an optical lattice setting. A possible application of our lattice
model could be to design a photonic lattice using single-mode laser-induced
photonic waveguides and study the corresponding photonic flat bands.

approach completely characterises the set of states leading to the EPR argument

is a technique to broaden users' queries by introducing additional tokens or

computational complexity to find semantically similar words and a possible
increase in noise in information retrieval. Despite several research efforts on
this topic, QE has not yet been explored enough and more work is needed on
similarity matching and composition of query terms with an objective to
retrieve a small set of most appropriate responses. QE should be scalable,
fast, and robust in handling complex queries with a good response time and

of spherical varieties (of which reductive groups are special cases), a map
between L-groups of spherical varieties should give rise to a functorial
transfer of their local and automorphic spectra. The ""Beyond Endoscopy""
proposal predicts that this transfer will be realized as a comparison between
the (relative) trace formulas of these spaces.
  In this paper we establish the local transfer for the identity map between
L-groups, for spherical affine homogeneous spaces X=H\G whose dual group is
SL(2) or PGL(2) (with G and H split). More precisely, we construct a transfer
operator between orbital integrals for the (X x X)/G-relative trace formula,
and orbital integrals for the Kuznetsov formula of PGL(2) or SL(2). Besides the
L-group, another invariant attached to X is a certain L-value, and the space of
test measures for the Kuznetsov formula is enlarged, to accommodate the given
L-value.
  The fundamental lemma for this transfer operator is proven in a forthcoming
paper of Johnstone and Krishna. The transfer operator is given explicitly in
terms of Fourier convolutions, making it suitable for a global comparison of
trace formulas by the Poisson summation formula, hence for a uniform proof, in
rank one, of the relations between periods of automorphic forms and special
values of L-functions.

of the luminous Seyfert galaxy PG1211+143 recently revealed a variable
multi-velocity wind. Here we report the detection of a short-lived, ultra-fast
inflow during the same observation. Previous reports of inflows used single
absorption lines with uncertain identifications, but this new result identifies
an array of resonance absorption lines of highly ionised Fe, Ca, Ar, S and Si,
sharing a common redshift when compared with a grid of realistic
photoionization spectra. The redshifted absorption arises in a column of highly
ionized matter close to the black hole, with a line-of-sight velocity, $v \sim
0.3c$, inconsistent with the standard picture of a plane circular accretion
disc. This may represent the first direct evidence for chaotic accretion in
AGN, where accretion discs are generally misaligned to the black hole spin. For
sufficient inclinations, the Lense-Thirring effect can break the discs into
discrete rings, which then precess, collide and shock, causing near free-fall
of gas towards the black hole. The observed accretion rate for the reported
infall is comparable to the hard X-ray luminosity in PG1211+143, suggesting
that direct infall may be a significant contributor to inner disc accretion.

dense structures (i.e., groups of vertices that exhibit a large number of
links), together with their temporal span (i.e., the period of time for which
the high density holds). We tackle this task by introducing a notion of
temporal core decomposition where each core is associated with its span: we
call such cores span-cores.
  As the total number of time intervals is quadratic in the size of the
temporal domain $T$ under analysis, the total number of span-cores is quadratic
in $|T|$ as well. Our first contribution is an algorithm that, by exploiting
containment properties among span-cores, computes all the span-cores
efficiently. Then, we focus on the problem of finding only the maximal
span-cores, i.e., span-cores that are not dominated by any other span-core by
both the coreness property and the span. We devise a very efficient algorithm
that exploits theoretical findings on the maximality condition to directly
compute the maximal ones without computing all span-cores.
  Experimentation on several real-world temporal networks confirms the
efficiency and scalability of our methods. Applications on temporal networks,
gathered by a proximity-sensing infrastructure recording face-to-face

superhighway construction, an alternative explicit relation-enrichment

Specifically, assuming partially overlapped items (users), superhighway
bypasses multi-hop inter-domain paths between cross-domain users (items,

experiments conducted on a real-world cross-region music dataset and a
cross-platform movie dataset show that the proposed superhighway construction

quantum circuit to exactly derive the master equation. We vary two parameters:
the number of qubits $N$ on each site (the onsite Hilbert space dimension) and
the power law exponent $\alpha$. Three light cone structures of OTOC appear at
$N = 1$: (1) logarithmic when $0.5<\alpha\lesssim 0.8$, (2) sublinear power law
when $0.8 \lesssim \alpha \lesssim 1.5$ and (3) linear when $\alpha \gtrsim

cases. When $\alpha \geq 2$, the OTOC has essentially the same diffusive
broadening as systems with short-range interactions, suggesting a complete
recovery of locality. In the large $N$ limit, it is always a logarithmic light
cone asymptotically, although a linear light cone can appear before the
transition time for $ \alpha \gtrsim 1.5$. This implies the locality is never

share their own base stations (BSs) with each other. First, we use techniques
from stochastic geometry to find the coverage probability of the infrastructure
sharing system and analyze the trade-off between increasing the transmit power
of a BS and the BS intensity of a buyer MNO required to achieve a given
quality-of-service (QoS) in terms of the coverage probability. We also analyze
the power consumption of the network per unit area (i.e., areal power
consumption) and show that it is a piecewise continuous function composed of a
linear and a convex functions. We show that when the transmit power of the BSs
and/or the BS intensity of a network increases, the system becomes interference
limited and the coverage probability tends to saturate at a certain value. As
such, when the required QoS is set above this bound, an MNO can improve its
coverage by buying infrastructure from other MNOs. Subsequently, we analyze the
strategy of a buyer MNO on choosing how many MNOs and which MNOs to buy the
infrastructure from. The optimal strategy of the buyer is given by greedy
fractional knapsack algorithm. On the sellers' side, the pricing and the
fraction of infrastructure to be sold are formulated using a Cournot oligopoly

approach to modeling term dependency by applying the quantum probability
theory. The latest development for a more effective QLM has adopted word
embeddings as a kind of global dependency information and integrated the
quantum-inspired idea in a neural network architecture. While these
quantum-inspired LMs are theoretically more general and also practically
effective, they have two major limitations. First, they have not taken into
account the interaction among words with multiple meanings, which is common and
important in understanding natural language text. Second, the integration of
the quantum-inspired LM with the neural network was mainly for effective
training of parameters, yet lacking a theoretical foundation accounting for
such integration. To address these two issues, in this paper, we propose a
Quantum Many-body Wave Function (QMWF) inspired language modeling approach. The
QMWF inspired LM can adopt the tensor product to model the aforesaid
interaction among words. It also enables us to reveal the inherent necessity of
using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in QMWF language modeling.
Furthermore, our approach delivers a simple algorithm to represent and match
text/sentence pairs. Systematic evaluation shows the effectiveness of the
proposed QMWF-LM algorithm, in comparison with the state of the art
quantum-inspired LMs and a couple of CNN-based methods, on three typical
Question Answering (QA) datasets.

black holes in another universe, a `mother universe'. It is argued that these
models offer a paradigm that may shed a new light on old cosmological problems.
The geometry of such a universe is discussed including how it would appear to
the observer. The Hubble parameter is direction dependent, but it is argued
that the interpretation of any such dependence will be hard to separate from
local inhomogeneities. The models do not originate from a big bang, but rather
from an initial collapse and subsequent infall, that started probably a very
long time ago, presumably much earlier than the accepted age of the universe.
The relation to the concordance model is discussed and it is shown that a lot
of the existing theory can be taken over into the proposed models. The universe
has an edge, which is an ordinary spherical surface in 3 dimensions. That
sphere acts as a gravitational mirror as seen from inside the universe, but it
does not mirror redshift. The same object can thus be seen in direct sight and
in reflection, although with different redshifts, different ages and different
aspect angles. The models do not need dark energy, but they need dark matter,
of course. Since the models are closed and neutrino's are nowadays believed to
have mass, neutrino's can be reconsidered as candidates for the dark matter. As
a bonus result from this paradigm, mass ejection from black holes is shown to
be possible, which links that process to the controversial anomalous galaxy
redshifts. Finally, we show that gravitational mass and inertial mass are
proportional, and that the inertial acceleration scales as $c^2/M$, with $M$ a
characteristic length scale of the universe.

the total particle density always has a finite value. Therefore, the Bogolyubov

with small values of the mode $k$ are produced in the past and particles with
large values of $k$ are produced only in the future. The negative pressure
resulting from the gravitational particle creation is also determined. It is
then argued that this pressure even in the presence of energy density and

for the production of ultra-cold atomic isotopes and isomers of cesium. The
setup covers a broad span of mass numbers and nuclear isomers, allowing one to
directly compare chains of isotopes and isotope/isomer pairs. Cesium nuclei are
produced by fission or fusion-evaporation reactions using primary proton beams
from a 130 MeV cyclotron impinging upon a suitable target. The species of
interest is ejected from the target in ionic form, electrostatically
accelerated, mass separated, and routed to a science chamber. Here, ions are
neutralized by implantation in a thin foil, and extracted by thermal diffusion.
A neutral vapor at room temperature is thus formed and trapped in a
magneto-optical trap. Real-time fluorescence imaging and destructive absorption
imaging provide information on the number of trapped atoms, their density, and
their temperature. Tests with a dedicated beam of $^{133}$Cs$^{+}$ ions at 30
keV energy confirm neutralization, evaporation, and laser cooling to 150
$\mu$K, with an average atomic density of 10$^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$. Availability of
cold and dense atomic samples of Cs isotopes and isomers opens new avenues for
high-precision measurements of isotopic and isomeric shifts thereby gaining
deeper insight into the nuclear structure, as well as for sensitive
measurements of isotopes' concentration ratios in trace quantities. The
facility also constitutes the core for future experiments of many-body physics
with nuclear isomers.

different limitations imposed by those media, but also to the very large amount
of information, it is impossible to collect all the data produced by social
networks such as Twitter. Therefore, to be able to gather enough relevant
information related to a predefined need, it is necessary to focus on a subset
of the information sources. In this work, we focus on user-centered data
capture and consider each account of a social network as a source that can be
listened to at each iteration of a data capture process, in order to collect
the corresponding produced contents. This process, whose aim is to maximize the
quality of the information gathered, is constrained by the number of users that
can be monitored simultaneously. The problem of selecting a subset of accounts
to listen to over time is a sequential decision problem under constraints,
which we formalize as a bandit problem with multiple selections. Therefore, we
propose several bandit models to identify the most relevant users in real time.
First, we study of the case of the stochastic bandit, in which each user
corresponds to a stationary distribution. Then, we introduce two contextual
bandit models, one stationary and the other non stationary, in which the
utility of each user can be estimated by assuming some underlying structure in
the reward space. The first approach introduces the notion of profile, which
corresponds to the average behavior of a user. The second approach takes into
account the activity of a user in order to predict his future behavior.
Finally, we are interested in models that are able to tackle complex temporal
dependencies between users, with the use of a latent space within which the
information transits from one iteration to the other. Each of the proposed
approaches is validated on both artificial and real datasets.

and eigenvectors fully characterize the solution. Commonly, such problems are
solved by numerical means, making it difficult to obtain insight in the role
that the parameters play on the solution. Our results provide a framework that
enables to compute individually, under some simple assumptions, the eigenvalues
of the matrices as roots of a monotone transcendental function with many
desirable properties. In order to do so, we first obtain a three-term recursive
characterization of the corresponding characteristic polynomials. This enables
the aforementioned representation. Our framework also allows for the
computation of bounds, numerical methods and even analytical characterizations
with closed form solutions, whenever the problem parameters satisfy simple

Complicating the issue, CAN messages lack a common mapping of functions to

transformational approach to CAN IDS that exploits the geometric properties of
CAN data to inform two novel detectors--one based on distance from a learned,
lower dimensional manifold and the other on discontinuities of the manifold
over time. Proof-of-concept tests are presented by implementing a potential
attack approach on a driving vehicle. The initial results suggest that (1) the
first detector requires additional refinement but does hold promise; (2) the
second detector gives a clear, strong indicator of the attack; and (3) the
algorithms keep pace with high-speed CAN messages. As our approach is
data-driven it provides a vehicle-agnostic IDS that eliminates the need to
reverse engineer CAN messages and can be ported to an after-market plugin.
