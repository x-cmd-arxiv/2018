L\'evy white noise. We do so by characterizing the weighted Besov spaces in
which it is located. We extend known results in two ways. First, we obtain new
bounds for the local smoothness via the Blumenthal-Getoor indices of the L\'evy
white noise. We also deduce the critical local smoothness when the two indices
coincide, which is true for symmetric-alpha-stable, compound Poisson, and
symmetric-gamma white noises to name a few. Second, we express the critical
asymptotic growth rate in terms of the moment properties of the L\'evy white
noise. Previous analyses only provided lower bounds for both the local
smoothness and the asymptotic growth rate. Showing the sharpness of these
bounds requires us to determine in which Besov spaces a given L\'evy white
noise is (almost surely) not. Our methods are based on the wavelet-domain
characterization of Besov spaces and precise moment estimates for the wavelet
coefficients of the L\'evy white noise.

multi-hierarchical paradigm and is based on the intuition that not all reviews
are created equal, i.e., only a select few are important. The importance,
however, should be dynamically inferred depending on the current target. To
this end, we propose a review-by-review pointer-based learning scheme that
extracts important reviews, subsequently matching them in a word-by-word
fashion. This enables not only the most informative reviews to be utilized for
prediction but also a deeper word-level interaction. Our pointer-based method
operates with a novel gumbel-softmax based pointer mechanism that enables the
incorporation of discrete vectors within differentiable neural architectures.
Our pointer mechanism is co-attentive in nature, learning pointers which are
co-dependent on user-item relationships. Finally, we propose a multi-pointer
learning scheme that learns to combine multiple views of interactions between
user and item. Overall, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model

peculiar behaviors have remain unexplained. In this work, experiment and theory
are used to show that they are network liquids---dynamic macromolecules that
appear elastic on short timescales but exhibit flow on longer timescales. Each
borosilicone is a vast covalent network of silicone polymer chains joined by
trifunctional boron crosslinks. At any instant, the borosilicone is a
highly-crosslinked elastic material. Because the boron crosslinks are
temporary, however, the network evolves with time and the borosilicone exhibits
liquid behavior. A simple borosilicone exemplifies a classic transient network
model and behaves as a simple (Lodge) elastic fluid. Its measured moduli and
viscosities fit those predicted by the transient network model and the Maxwell
viscoelastic model: a spring in series with a dashpot, including the observed
exponential relaxation processes. When a borosilicone includes permanent
crosslinks, however, it no longer behaves as a simple elastic fluid. Its
measured moduli and viscosities fit those predicted by the Fractional Maxwell
viscoelastic model: a spring in series with a the spring-pot, including the
observed slower-than-exponential relaxation processes. Beyond the gelation
threshold, a borosilicone becomes a viscoelastic silicone rubber (VSR). With a
permanent network that spans the material coupled to a temporary network that
also spans the material, the VSR is a network liquid piggybacking on a network
solid. The Fractional Zener viscoelastic model: an elastic spring in parallel
to the Fractional Maxwell model, accurately predicts the measured moduli of
VSRs. The temporary nature of boron crosslinks is due to exchange reactions.
Because the mean lifetime of temporary crosslinks is a borosilicone's only
significant timescale, it exhibits thermo-rheological simplicity.

implementation of the unload operation. Furthermore, we measure the service
performance of the system by finding the conditional probability-coverage
probability with the certain SNR threshold as the condition, that is, the
probability of obtaining the minimum communication quality when the different
base stations are connected to the user. Then, user-centered total energy
consumption of the system is respectively obtained when the macro base

simulation results show that the hierarchical SBS cooperation in heterogeneous

complexity of a system. Various entropy-based measures such as functional and
spectral entropies have been proposed in brain network analysis. However, they
are less widely used than traditional graph theoretic measures such as global
and local efficiencies because either they are not well-defined on a graph or
difficult to interpret its biological meaning. In this paper, we propose a new
entropy-based graph invariant, called volume entropy. It measures the
exponential growth rate of the number of paths in a graph, which is a relevant
measure if information flows through the graph forever. We model the
information propagation on a graph by the generalized Markov system associated
to the weighted edge-transition matrix. We estimate the volume entropy using
the stationary equation of the generalized Markov system. A prominent advantage
of using the stationary equation is that it assigns certain distribution of
weights on the edges of the brain graph, which we call the stationary
distribution. The stationary distribution shows the information capacity of
edges and the direction of information flow on a brain graph. The simulation
results show that the volume entropy distinguishes the underlying graph
topology and geometry better than the existing graph measures. In brain imaging
data application, the volume entropy of brain graphs was significantly related
to healthy normal aging from 20s to 60s. In addition, the stationary
distribution of information propagation gives a new insight into the

  A sequential approach was also developed for efficient test source allocation

selects experimental tests for validation that has a full coverage of the test
domain to avoid extrapolation of model discrepancy term when evaluated at input
setting of tests for inverse UQ. Then it selects tests that tend to reside in
the unfilled zones of the test domain for inverse UQ, so that one can extract

stems from photon absorption. Dissipation can also be caused by the retarded
response to the time-dependent excitation, and in general gives insight into
the system's relaxation times and mechanisms. We address the dissipation in a
mesoscopic normal wire with superconducting contacts, that sustains a
supercurrent at zero frequency and that may be expected to remain
dissipationless at frequency lower than the superconducting gap. We probe the
high frequency linear response of a Normal/Superconductor ring to a
time-dependent flux by coupling it to a highly sensitive multimode microwave
resonator. Far from being the simple derivative of the current-phase relation,
the ring's ac susceptibility also displays a dissipative component whose phase
dependence is a signature of the dynamical processes occurring within the
Andreev spectrum. We show how dissipation is driven by the competition between
the two aforementioned mechanisms. Depending on the relative strength of those
contributions, dissipation can be maximal at $\pi$, when the minigap closes, or
can be maximal near $ \pi/2$, when the dc supercurrent is maximal. We also find
that the dissipative response increases at low temperature and can even exceed
the normal state conductance. The results are confronted with predictions of
the Kubo linear response and time-dependent Usadel equations. This experiment
shows the power of the ac susceptibility measurement of individual hybrid
mesoscopic systems in probing in a controlled way the quantum dynamics of ABS.
By spanning different physical regimes, our experiments provide a unique access

been classified by the hierarchy of the fundamental length scales of the
theory; the magnetic field penetration lengths and coherence lengths. In the
simplest single-component case they form a dimensionless ratio \kappa. As
pointed out by Ginzburg in 1952, in general the ratio depends on the direction
of the applied magnetic field due to material anisotropies. Single component
materials can therefore display type-1 superconductivity when the field is
applied in one direction and type-2 when the field is applied in a different
direction. In this paper we expand the above length scale analysis to
anisotropic multi-component superconductors, that can have multiple coherence
lengths as well as multiple magnetic field penetration lengths, leading to
unconvential length scale hierarchies. We demonstrate that the anisotropies in
multi-band superconductors cannot in general be rescaled, leading to new
regimes with various mixed hierarchies in different directions. For example, a
regime is possible, where for a field applied in a certain direction coherence
lengths are smaller than the magnetic field penetration lengths in one of the
perpendicular directions, where as the penetration lengths are lager in the
another direction. We demonstrate a new regime, where vortices form stripes in
the direction where coherence lengths exceed the magnetic field penetration
length and vortex cores overlap, while the vortex stripes repel each other in
the orthogonal direction where the magnetic field penetration length exceeds
the coherence lengths.

NP$^{\#\rm P}$ (Mittmann, Saxena, Scheiblechner, Trans.AMS'14). In this work we

unlikely to be NP-hard and joins the league of problems of ""intermediate""

algebro-geometric-- estimating the size of the image/preimage of the polynomial
map $\mathbf{f}$ over the finite field. A gap in this size is utilized in the
AM protocols.
  Next, we study the open question of testing whether every annihilator of

characterization using Zariski closure of the image of $\mathbf{f}$;
introducing a new problem called approximate polynomials satisfiability (APS).

involves the complexities associated with many particle collisions. To address
these issues we introduce a method based on acoustic levitation, which makes it
possible to initiate sequences of repeated collisions of a single
sub-millimeter particle with a flat plate, and to precisely measure the
particle charge in-situ after each collision. We show that collisional charge
transfer between insulators is dependent on the hydrophobicity of the
contacting surfaces. We use glass, which we modify by attaching nonpolar
molecules to the particle, the plate, or both. We find that hydrophilic
surfaces develop significant positive charges after contacting hydrophobic
surfaces. Moreover, we demonstrate that charging between a hydrophilic and a
hydrophobic surface is suppressed in an acidic environment and enhanced in a
basic one. Application of an electric field during each collision is found to
modify the charge transfer, again depending on surface hydrophobicity. We
discuss these results within the context of contact charging due to ion
transfer and show that they lend strong support to OH- ions as the charge
carriers.

these materials in the presence of in-plane magnetic field demonstrate
spontaneous symmetry breaking: 180$^\circ$-rotation symmetry of
superconductivity versus 120$^\circ$-rotation symmetry of the crystal. Such
behavior brilliantly confirms nematic topological superconductivity. To what
extent this nematicity is due to superconducting pairing in these materials,
rather than due to crystal structure distortions? This question remained
unanswered, because so far no visible deviations from the 3-fold crystal
symmetry were resolved in these materials. To address this question we grow
high quality single crystals of Sr$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$, perform detailed X-ray
diffraction and magnetotransport studies and reveal that the observed
superconducting nematicity direction correlates with the direction of small
structural distortions in these samples( $\sim 0.02$\% elongation in one
crystallographic direction). Additional anisotropy comes from orientation of
the crystallite axes. 2-fold symmetry of magnetoresistance observed in the most
uniform crystals well above critical temperature demonstrates that these
structural distortions are nevertheless strong enough. Our data in combination
with strong sample-to-sample variation of the superconductive anisotropy

Russian trolls managed to stay active for long periods of time and to reach a
substantial number of Twitter users with their tweets. When looking at their
ability of spreading news content and making it viral, however, we find that
their effect on social platforms was minor, with the significant exception of

immiscible fluid layers with different densities, viscosities and thicknesses,
bounded by two infinite parallel plates moving at a constant relative velocity
to each other, with an insoluble surfactant along the interface and in the
presence of gravity is carried out. The normal modes approach is applied to the
equations governing flow disturbances. These equations, together with boundary
conditions at the plates and the interface, yield a linear eigenvalue problem.
When inertia is neglected velocity amplitudes are linear combinations of
hyperbolic functions, and a quadratic dispersion equation for the complex
growth rate is obtained where coefficients depend on the aspect ratio, the
viscosity ratio, the basic velocity shear, the Marangoni number Ma that
measures the effects of surfactant, and the Bond number Bo that measures the
influence of gravity. An extensive investigation is carried out that examines
the stabilizing or destabilizing influences of these parameters. There are two
continuous branches of the normal modes: a robust branch that exists even with
no surfactant, and a surfactant branch that vanishes when Ma $\downarrow 0$.
Due to the availability of the explicit forms for the growth rates, in many
instances the numerical results are corroborated with analytical asymptotics.
For the less unstable branch, a mid-wave interval of unstable wavenumbers
(Halpern and Frenkel (2003)) sometimes co-exists with a long-wave one. We study
the instability landscape, determined by the threshold curve of the long-wave
instability and the critical curve of the mid-wave instability in the (Ma,

~150 mas, corresponding to the locus of the main dust formation region of both

excited states. Detected species include the gaseous precursors of dust grains
such as SiO, AlO, AlOH, TiO, and TiO2. We present a spectral atlas for both
stars and the parameters of all detected spectral features. A clear dichotomy
for the sulphur chemistry is seen: while CS, SiS, SO, and SO2 are abundantly
present in IK Tau, only SO and SO2 are detected in R Dor. Also other species
such as NaCl, NS, AlO, and AlOH display a completely different behaviour. From
some selected species, the minor isotopologues can be used to assess the
isotopic ratios. The channel maps of many species prove that both large and
small-scale inhomogeneities persist in the inner wind of both stars in the form
of blobs, arcs, and/or a disk. The high sensitivity of ALMA allows us to spot
the impact of these correlated density structures in the spectral line
profiles. The spectral lines often display a half width at zero intensity much
larger than expected from the terminal velocity, v_inf, previously derived for
both objects (36 km/s versus v_inf ~17.7 km/s for IK Tau and 23 km/s versus
v_inf ~5.5 km/s for R Dor). Both a more complex 3D morphology and a more
forceful wind acceleration of the (underlying) isotropic wind can explain this
trend. The formation of fractal grains in the region beyond ~400 mas can
potentially account for the latter scenario. From the continuum map, we deduce
a dust mass of ~3.7e-7 Msun for IK Tau and ~2e-8 Msun for R Dor.

algorithm is evaluated on data collected autonomously by a mobile robot in an

automatically identifies and tracks the moving objects within 3D maps and

intimately connected to his early methodology, in which clarity achieved by
concrete physical pictures played an essential role; and to the related fact
that on his route to the general theory he focused on special situations that
were easily accessible to physical intuition. The details of this background of
Einstein's early reasoning have not always been sufficiently appreciated in

stars. The consequences of giving up this assumption are investigated here. In
particular, hyperbolic stellar trajectories are found to be interesting. The
two suggested models for the production of such trajectories will also explain
the observed flat rotation curves without the postulation of dark matter or
MOND. It is suggested that spiral galaxies may have started as compact objects
with significant angular momenta and then disintegrated. The first model
conjectures the existence of a spinning hot disk around a spherical galactic
core. The disk is held together by local gravity and electromagnetic scattering
forces. However, it disintegrates at the edge producing fragments that form
stars. Once separated from the disk, the stars experience only the centrally
directed gravitational force due to the massive core and remaining disk. A
numerical simulation shows that a high enough angular velocity of the disk
produces hyperbolic stellar trajectories that agree with the observed rotation
curves. The second model conjectures a significant initial thermonuclear event
that produces a dust plume along with large stars. This dust plume is made of
ordinary matter. However, it acts like the postulated dark matter in producing
initial circular trajectories. Unlike dark matter, the plume can be shown to
escape the galaxy rapidly causing the star trajectories to evolve to hyperbolic
shapes. This process can be seen to produce the observed rotation curves due to
the initial circular orbits. Also, as the plume dissipates rapidly it does not
obfuscate the stars from view. Both models have weaknesses as do the currently
known models using dark matter or MOND.

  136-148",,,"physics.hist-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  According to what has become a standard history of quantum mechanics, in 1932
von Neumann persuaded the physics community that hidden variables are
impossible as a matter of principle, after which leading proponents of the
Copenhagen interpretation put the situation to good use by arguing that the
completeness of quantum mechanics was undeniable. This state of affairs lasted,
so the story continues, until Bell in 1966 exposed von Neumann's proof as
obviously wrong. The realization that von Neumann's proof was fallacious then
rehabilitated hidden variables and made serious foundational research possible
again. It is often added in recent accounts that von Neumann's error had been
spotted almost immediately by Grete Hermann, but that her discovery was of no
effect due to the dominant Copenhagen Zeitgeist. We shall attempt to tell a
story that is more historically accurate and less ideologically charged. Most
importantly, von Neumann never claimed to have shown the impossibility of
hidden variables tout court, but argued that hidden-variable theories must
possess a structure that deviates fundamentally from that of quantum mechanics.
Both Hermann and Bell appear to have missed this point, moreover, both raised
unjustified technical objections to the proof. Von Neumann's argument was
basically that hidden-variables schemes must violate the ""quantum principle""
that physical quantities are to be represented by operators in a Hilbert space.
As a consequence, hidden-variables schemes, though possible in principle,
necessarily exhibit a certain kind of contextuality.

mobile scenarios such as vehicular networks. Therefore, an efficient beam
alignment mechanism is required to mitigate the resulting overhead. In this
paper, a one-dimensional mobility model is proposed where a mobile user (MU),
such as a vehicle, moves along a straight road with time-varying and random
speed, and communicates with base stations (BSs) located on the roadside over
the mm-wave band. To compensate for location uncertainty, the BS widens its
transmission beam and, when a critical beamwidth is achieved, it performs
beam-sweeping to refine the MU position estimate, followed by data
communication over a narrow beam. The average rate and average transmission
power are computed in closed form and the optimal beamwidth for communication,
number of sweeping beams, and transmission power allocation are derived so as
to maximize the average rate under an average power constraint. Structural
properties of the optimal design are proved, and a bisection algorithm to
determine the optimal sweeping -- communication parameters is designed. It is
shown numerically that an adaptation of the IEEE 802.11ad standard to the
proposed model exhibits up to 90% degradation in spectral efficiency compared
to the proposed scheme.

this platform, thermalization of a quantum system can be achieved by
interfacing the circuit QED subsystem with a thermal reservoir of appropriate

consisting of a superconducting qubit capacitively coupled between two
nominally identical coplanar waveguide resonators, each equipped with a heat

report the observation of tunable photonic heat transport through the
resonator-qubit-resonator assembly, showing that the reservoir-to-reservoir
heat flux depends on the interplay between the qubit-resonator and the
resonator-reservoir couplings, yielding qualitatively dissimilar results in
different coupling regimes. Our quantum heat valve is relevant for the

It is based on the concept of active learning (AL) via Query by Committee
(QBC), which uses the disagreement between an ensemble of ML potentials to
infer the reliability of the ensemble's prediction. QBC allows the presented AL
algorithm to automatically sample regions of chemical space where the ML
potential fails to accurately predict the potential energy. AL improves the
overall fitness of ANAKIN-ME (ANI) deep learning potentials in rigorous test
cases by mitigating human biases in deciding what new training data to use. AL
also reduces the training set size to a fraction of the data required when
using naive random sampling techniques. To provide validation of our AL
approach we develop the COMP6 benchmark (publicly available on GitHub), which
contains a diverse set of organic molecules. Through the AL process, it is
shown that the AL-based potentials perform as well as the ANI-1 potential on
COMP6 with only 10% of the data, and vastly outperforms ANI-1 with 25% the
amount of data. Finally, we show that our proposed AL technique develops a
universal ANI potential (ANI-1x) that provides accurate energy and force
predictions on the entire COMP6 benchmark. This universal ML potential achieves
a level of accuracy on par with the best ML potentials for single molecule or

Jupiter) are the dominating factor determining the orbital evolution of dust
particles. Therefore, the lifetimes of cometary dust particles (~250 thousand
years) are shorter than the Poynting-Robertson lifetime, and only a small
fraction of large cometary dust particles can be transferred into orbits with
small values of a. The exceptions are dust particles from 2P/Encke and,
potentially, active asteroids that have little interaction with Jupiter. We
also found that the effect of dust shape, mass density, and SFD were not
critical in the total mass supply rate to the Interplanetary Dust Particle
(IDP) cloud complex when these quantities are confined by observations of
zodiacal light brightness and SFD around the Earth's orbit. When we incorporate
a population of fluffy aggregates discovered in the Earth's stratosphere and
the coma of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko within the initial ejection, the initial
SFD measured at the comae of comets (67P and 81P/Wild 2) can produce the
observed SFD around the Earth's orbit. Considering the above effects, we
derived the probability of mutual collisions among dust particles within the
IDP cloud for the first time in a direct manner via numerical simulation and
concluded that mutual collisions are mostly ignorable.

contamination in places (such as work places and homes) and public transit

who travel to some places using public transit, and introduce public transit
into the epidemic spreading process. A novel modeling framework is proposed
considering place-based infections and the public-transit-based infections. In
the urban scenario, we investigate the public transit trip contribution rate

impact of the public transit trip contribution rate by evaluating the volume of
infectious people. Scenarios for strategies such as public transit and school
closure were tested and analyzed. Our simulation results suggest that
individuals with a high public transit trip contribution rate will increase the
volume of infectious people when an infectious disease outbreak occurs by
affecting the social network through the public transit trip contribution rate.

feature map downsampling to a random point in the layer hierarchy, with a

as an optimization problem which jointly incorporates user association,
spectrum allocation, and content caching. To solve this problem, a distributed
algorithm based on the machine learning framework of liquid state machine (LSM)
is proposed. Using the proposed LSM algorithm, the cloud can predict the users'
content request distribution while having only limited information on the
network's and users' states. The proposed algorithm also enables the UAVs to
autonomously choose the optimal resource allocation strategies that maximize
the number of users with stable queues depending on the network states. Based
on the users' association and content request distributions, the optimal
contents that need to be cached at UAVs as well as the optimal resource
allocation are derived. Simulation results using real datasets show that the
proposed approach yields up to 33.3% and 50.3% gains, respectively, in terms of
the number of users that have stable queues compared to two baseline

generalization error when learning in the context of concept drift. One posits
that as drift rate increases, the forgetting rate that minimizes generalization
error will also increase and vice versa. The other posits that as a learner's
forgetting rate increases, the bias/variance profile that minimizes
generalization error will have lower variance and vice versa. These hypotheses
lead to the concept of the sweet path, a path through the 3-d space of
alternative drift rates, forgetting rates and bias/variance profiles on which
generalization error will be minimized, such that slow drift is coupled with
low forgetting and low bias, while rapid drift is coupled with fast forgetting
and low variance. We present experiments that support the existence of such a
sweet path. We also demonstrate that simple learners that select appropriate

numerical solution of boundary value problems of mathematical physics. By
definition, these functions satisfy locally, in weak form, the underlying
differential equations of the problem, which often results in high-order or
even exponential convergence with respect to the size of the basis set. We
highlight two separate examples of that in applied electromagnetics and
photonics: (i) homogenization of periodic structures, and (ii) numerical
simulation of electromagnetic waves in slab geometries. Extensive numerical
evidence and theoretical considerations show that Trefftz approximations can be
applied much more broadly than is traditionally done: they are effective not
only in physically homogeneous regions but also in complex inhomogeneous ones.
Two mechanisms underlying the high accuracy of Trefftz approximations in such
complex cases are pointed out. The first one is related to trigonometric
interpolation and the second one -- somewhat surprisingly -- to well-posedness
of random matrices.

first computational model aimed at Pictionary, the popular word-guessing social
game. We first introduce Sketch-QA, an elementary version of Visual Question
Answering task. Styled after Pictionary, Sketch-QA uses incrementally
accumulated sketch stroke sequences as visual data. Notably, Sketch-QA involves
asking a fixed question (""What object is being drawn?"") and gathering
open-ended guess-words from human guessers. We analyze the resulting dataset
and present many interesting findings therein. To mimic Pictionary-style
guessing, we subsequently propose a deep neural model which generates
guess-words in response to temporally evolving human-drawn sketches. Our model
even makes human-like mistakes while guessing, thus amplifying the human
mimicry factor. We evaluate our model on the large-scale guess-word dataset
generated via Sketch-QA task and compare with various baselines. We also
conduct a Visual Turing Test to obtain human impressions of the guess-words
generated by humans and our model. Experimental results demonstrate the promise

general, halos around galaxies with active star formation (including spirals
and gas rich dwarfs) are dynamical: they expand and contract in response to
heating and cooling processes. Ordinary Type II supernovae (SN) can provide the
dominant heat source, possible if kinetic mixing interaction exists with
strength $\epsilon \sim 10^{-9} - 10^{-10}$. Dissipative dark matter halos can
be modelled as a fluid governed by Euler's equations. Around sufficiently
isolated and unperturbed galaxies the halo can relax to a steady state
configuration, where heating and cooling rates locally balance and hydrostatic
equilibrium prevails. These steady state conditions can be solved to derive the
physical properties, including the halo density and temperature profiles, for
model galaxies. Here, we have considered idealized spherically symmetric
galaxies within the mirror dark particle model, as in the earlier paper [paper
I, arXiv:1707.02528], but we have assumed that the local halo heating in the SN
vicinity dominates over radiative sources. With this assumption, physically
interesting steady state solutions arise which we compute for a representative
range of model galaxies. The end result is a rather simple description of the
dark matter halo around idealized spherically symmetric systems, characterized
in principle by only one parameter, with physical properties that closely
resemble the empirical properties of disk galaxies.

this objective, an algorithm that is called the Discrete-time occupancies
trajectory based Intersection traffic Coordination Algorithm (DICA) is
proposed. All vehicles in the system are Connected and Autonomous Vehicles
(CAVs) and capable of wireless Vehicle-to-Intersection communication. In the
proposed framework, an intersection coordinates the motions of CAVs based on
their proposed DTOTs to let them cross the intersection efficiently while
avoiding collisions. In case when there is a collision between vehicles' DTOTs,
the intersection modifies conflicting DTOTs to avoid the collision and requests
CAVs to approach and cross the intersection according to the modified DTOTs. We
then prove that the basic DICA is deadlock free and also starvation free. We
also show that the basic DICA is conservative in computational complexity and
improve it by several computational approaches.
  Next, we addressed the problem of evacuating emergency vehicles as quickly as
possible through autonomous and connected intersection traffic in this
dissertation. The proposed intersection control algorithm Reactive DICA aims to
determine an efficient vehicle-passing sequence which allows the emergency
vehicle to cross an intersection as soon as possible while the travel times of
other vehicles are minimally affected. When there are no emergency vehicles
within the intersection area, the vehicles are controlled by DICA. When there
are emergency vehicles entering communication range, we prioritize emergency
vehicles through optimal ordering of vehicles. A genetic algorithm is proposed
to solve the optimization problem which finds the optimal vehicle sequence that
gives the emergency vehicles the highest priority.

demonstrated without the need for mirror symmetry of the electron source and
its focusing image. We show a tunable focusing position that can be used in a

concept to realize Veselago focusing relevant for potential applications, and
it paves the way for the design of novel electron optics devices by exploiting

Therefore, the observation of resonances in the states with $I=1$ will be
indicative of their production or decay with the isotopic symmetry breaking.
Here, we bear in mind the cases of the anomalous breaking of the isotopic
symmetry, i.e., when the cross section of the process breaking the isospin is
not of the order of $10^{-4}$ of the cross section of the allowed process but
of the order of $1\%$. The paper draws attention to the reactions $pp\to

owing to the $K\bar K$ loop mechanisms of the breaking of isotopic symmetry. We

  seemingly unrelated problem of computing conjugacy classes of elements of
finite order in arithmetic

these claims have not been officially accepted by scientific communities.
Currently, the highest transition temperature (Tc) recognized in scientific
articles is 135 K at 1 atm of Hg-Ba-Ca-Cu-O system which is a copper oxide
superconductor. We packed graphite flakes into a ring-shaped
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tube and further injected heptane or octane.
Then we generated circulating current in this ring tube by electromagnetic
induction and showed that this circulating current continues to flow
continuously at room temperature for 50 days. This experiment suggests that
bringing alkane into contact with graphite may result in a material with zero
resistance at room temperature. In addition, we showed by means of AC
resistance measurements using the two-terminal method that the resistances of
graphite fibers brought into contact with various alkanes suddenly change at
specific critical temperatures between 363 and 504 K. In this study, we show
that after a magnetic field is applied to a single-layer graphene at room
temperature, alkane is brought into contact with the single-layer graphene,
then the graphene excludes the magnetic field immediately. This phenomenon
demonstrates that the alkane-wetted single-layer graphene shows Meissner effect
at room temperature. Furthermore, we applied a magnetic field perpendicularly
to the annular single-layer graphene brought into contact with n-hexane and
immediately removed the magnetic field. After that we observed that a constant
magnetic field generates from this annular graphene for some time. In
conclusion, the single-layer graphene brought into contact with alkane shows
Meissner effect at room temperature, which provides definitive evidence for
room temperature superconductivity.

from a few times $10^{-9} photon\: cm^{-2} s^{-1}$ to $10^{-7} photon\:
cm^{-2}s^{-1}$. Over long time periods, power-law provides an adequate
description of the $\gamma$-ray spectra of almost all sources. Significant
curvature is observed in the $\gamma$-ray spectra of NGC 1275, NGC 6251, SBS
0846+513 and PMN J0948+0022 and their spectra are better described by
log-parabola or power-law with exponential cut-off models. The $\gamma$-ray

power-law shape, indicating a spectral cutoff around the observed photon energy
of $E_{cut}=131.2\pm88.04$ GeV and $E_{cut}=55.57\pm50.74$ GeV, respectively.
Our analysis confirms the previous finding of an unusual spectral turnover in
the $\gamma$-ray spectrum of Cen A: the photon index changes from $2.75\pm0.02$

typically appear with a harder photon index) and the highest- SSRQs/NLSY1s
(with softer photon indexes). We confirm the previously reported

emission from NLSY1s, 1H 0323+342, SBS 0846+513 and PMN J0948+0022, is
variable, showing flares in short scales sometimes accompanied by a moderate
hardening of their spectra (e.g., on MJD 56146.8 the $\gamma$-ray photon index
of SBS 0846+513 was $1.73\pm0.14$). 3C 111, Cen A core, 3C 207, 3C 275.1, 3C

phase transition with an associated critical endpoint (CEP) as $\mu_B$
increases. Such a $\mu_B$-dependent quark-hadron transition is expected to
result in a double-peak structure in the collision energy dependence of the
baryon density fluctuation in heavy-ion collisions with one at lower energy due
to the spinodal instability during the first-order phase transition and another
at higher energy due to the critical fluctuations in the vicinity of the CEP.
By analyzing the data on the $p$, d and $^3$H yields in central heavy-ion

that the relative neutron density fluctuation $\Delta \rho_n=\langle(\delta

We then analyze the energy and information outage performance in the energy
harvest and backscatter modulation phases of the backscatter network,
respectively. The optimal transmission slot length and division are obtained by
maximizing the network-wide spatial throughput. Moreover, we find an
interesting result that there exists the optimal tradeoff between the durations

maximization. Numerical results are demonstrated to verify our analytical
findings and show that this tradeoff region gets shrunk when the outage

correct this bias. However, while LPO produces an almost unbiased estimate of
AUC, it does not provide a ranking of the data needed for plotting and
analyzing the ROC curve. In this study, we propose a new method called
tournament leave-pair-out (TLPO) cross-validation. This method extends LPO by
creating a tournament from pair comparisons to produce a ranking for the data.
TLPO preserves the advantage of LPO for estimating AUC, while it also allows
performing ROC analysis. We have shown using both synthetic and real world data
that TLPO is as reliable as LPO for AUC estimation and confirmed the bias in
leave-one-out cross-validation on low-dimensional data.

a twice continuously differentiable function. While the CR method is widely
recognized as a globally convergent variant of Newton's method with superior
iteration complexity, existing results on its local quadratic convergence
require a stringent non-degeneracy condition. We prove that under a local error
bound (EB) condition, which is much weaker a requirement than the existing
non-degeneracy condition, the sequence of iterates generated by the CR method
converges at least Q-quadratically to a second-order critical point. This
indicates that adding a cubic regularization not only equips Newton's method
with remarkable global convergence properties but also enables it to converge
quadratically even in the presence of degenerate solutions. As a byproduct, we
show that without assuming convexity, the proposed EB condition is equivalent
to a quadratic growth condition, which could be of independent interest. To
demonstrate the usefulness and relevance of our convergence analysis, we focus
on two concrete nonconvex optimization problems that arise in phase retrieval
and low-rank matrix recovery, respectively, and prove that with overwhelming
probability, the sequence of iterates generated by the CR method for solving
these two problems converges at least Q-quadratically to a global minimizer. We
also present numerical results of the CR method when applied to solve these two
problems to support and complement our theoretical development.

specifically, we reformulate the softmax loss as a cosine loss by $L_2$
normalizing both features and weight vectors to remove radial variations, based
on which a cosine margin term is introduced to further maximize the decision
margin in the angular space. As a result, minimum intra-class variance and
maximum inter-class variance are achieved by virtue of normalization and cosine
decision margin maximization. We refer to our model trained with LMCL as
CosFace. Extensive experimental evaluations are conducted on the most popular
public-domain face recognition datasets such as MegaFace Challenge, Youtube
Faces (YTF) and Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW). We achieve the state-of-the-art
performance on these benchmarks, which confirms the effectiveness of our
proposed approach.

interactions and magnetic anisotropies characterizing the Co monolayer for all

the Co atoms and the nearest-neighbor isotropic exchange interaction, which is
attributed to the electronic hybridization between the Co and the capping

Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is decreased for all overlayers compared to
the uncapped Co/Pt(111) system, while even the sign of the

conclude that the variation of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is well
correlated with the change of the magnetic anisotropy energy and of the orbital
moment anisotropy. The unique influence of the Ir overlayer on the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is traced by scaling the strength of the
spin--orbit coupling of the Ir atoms in Ir/Co/Pt(111) and by changing the Ir

local vibration patterns at different image locations. We show that different
locations in the image vibrate differently. We carefully aggregate local
vibrations and produce a sound quality that improves state-of-the-art. We show
that local vibrations could have a time delay because sound waves take time to
travel through the air. We use this phenomenon to estimate sound direction. We
also present a novel algorithm that speeds up sound extraction by two to three

results, we find that the disagreement between the effective temperature scale
of red giants and models with solar calibrated mixing length disappears when
considering our models and the APOGEE-Kepler stars with scaled solar metal

generally underpredict the change of temperature of red giants caused by
alpha-element enhancements at fixed [Fe/H]. A second important conclusion is
that the choice of the outer boundary conditions employed in model calculations

models with solar calibrated mixing length and observations appear for some
choices of the boundary conditions, but this is not a general result

approximates both trainable weights and neural activations in deep networks by

with non-differentiable functions. Our solution enables the removal of the
expensive floating-point matrix multiplications throughout any convolutional

fully-convolutional network (FCN) for CT pancreas segmentation leads to more
than 10-fold reduced memory requirements and we provide a concept for
sub-second inference without GPUs. Our ternary approximation obtains high
accuracies (without any post-processing) with a Dice overlap of 71.0% that are
statistically equivalent to using networks with high-precision weights and
activations. We further demonstrate the significant improvements reached in
comparison to binary quantisation and without our proposed ternary hyperbolic

techniques has been actively conducted, achieving considerably high detection
accuracies. Many studies only focus on the detection of the presence or absence
of damage. However, in a real-world scenario, when the road managers from a
governing body need to repair such damage, they need to clearly understand the
type of damage in order to take effective action. In addition, in many of these
previous studies, the researchers acquire their own data using different
methods. Hence, there is no uniform road damage dataset available openly,
leading to the absence of a benchmark for road damage detection. This study
makes three contributions to address these issues. First, to the best of our
knowledge, for the first time, a large-scale road damage dataset is prepared.
This dataset is composed of 9,053 road damage images captured with a smartphone
installed on a car, with 15,435 instances of road surface damage included in
these road images. In order to generate this dataset, we cooperated with 7
municipalities in Japan and acquired road images for more than 40 hours. These
images were captured in a wide variety of weather and illuminance conditions.
In each image, we annotated the bounding box representing the location and type
of damage. Next, we used a state-of-the-art object detection method using
convolutional neural networks to train the damage detection model with our
dataset, and compared the accuracy and runtime speed on both, using a GPU
server and a smartphone. Finally, we demonstrate that the type of damage can be
classified into eight types with high accuracy by applying the proposed object
detection method. The road damage dataset, our experimental results, and the
developed smartphone application used in this study are publicly available

of lattice QCD with two dynamical flavours ( $N_f = 2$ ). The theory is
regularised on a lattice with a plaquette Wilson action and
$\mathcal{O}(a)$-improved Wilson fermions. For one of these operators, the
computation had been performed in ref. [1]; the present work completes the
study for the rest of the operator basis, on the same simulations
(configuration ensembles). The related weak matrix elements arise in several
operator product expansions; in $\Delta F = 2$ transitions they contain the QCD
long-distance effects, including contributions from beyond-Standard Model (BSM)
processes. Some of these operators mix under renormalisation and their
RG-running is governed by anomalous dimension matrices. In ref. [2] the RG
formalism for the operator basis has been worked out in full generality and the
anomalous dimension matrix has been calculated in NLO perturbation theory. Here
the discussion is extended to the matrix step-scaling functions (matrix-SSFs),
which are used in finite-size recursive techniques. We rely on these
matrix-SSFs to obtain non-perturbative estimates of the operator anomalous
dimensions for scales ranging from $\mathcal{O}(\Lambda_{\rm QCD})$ to

researchers can statistically summarize and combine data from multiple studies
by conducting meta-analysis. In meta-analysis, mean differences are frequently
used effect size measurements to deal with continuous data, such as the Cohen's
d statistic and Hedges' g statistic values. To calculate the mean difference
based effect sizes, the sample mean and standard deviation are two essential
summary measures. However, many of the clinical reports tend not to directly
record the sample mean and standard deviation. Instead, the sample size,
median, minimum and maximum values and/or the first and third quartiles are
reported. As a result, researchers have to transform the reported information
to the sample mean and standard deviation for further compute the effect size.
Since most of the popular transformation methods were developed upon the
normality assumption of the underlying data, it is necessary to perform a
pre-test before transforming the summary statistics. In this article, we had
introduced test statistics for three popular scenarios in meta-analysis. We
suggests medical researchers to perform a normality test of the selected
studies before using them to conduct further analysis. Moreover, we applied
three different case studies to demonstrate the usage of the newly proposed
test statistics. The real data case studies indicate that the new test
statistics are easy to apply in practice and by following the recommended path
to conduct the meta-analysis, researchers can obtain more reliable conclusions.

The ISN He atom signals are observed at the four lowest ESA steps of the
IBEX-Lo sensor. The observed signal is a mixture of the primary and secondary
components of ISN He and H. Previously, only data from one of the ESA steps
have been used. Here, we extended the analysis to data collected in the three
lowest ESA steps with the strongest ISN He signal, for the observation seasons
2009-2015. The instrument sensitivity is modeled as a linear function of the
atom impact speed onto the sensor's conversion surface separately for each ESA
step of the instrument. We found that the sensitivity increases from lower to
higher ESA steps, but within each of the ESA steps it is a decreasing function
of the atom impact speed. This result may be influenced by the hydrogen
contribution, which was not included in the adopted model, but seems to exist
in the signal. We conclude that the currently accepted temperature of ISN He
and velocity of the Sun through the interstellar medium do not need a revision,
and we sketch a plan of further data analysis aiming at investigating ISN H and
a better understanding of the population of ISN He originating in the outer
heliosheath.

challenging problem. Individuals' decisions and actions are affected by
interlaced factors, such as physical location, homophily, and social ties. In
this paper, we propose to examine the role that distinct communities, linked to
these factors, play as sources of social influence. The ego network is
typically used in the social influence analysis. Our hypothesis is that
individuals are embedded in communities not only related to their direct social
relationships, but that involve different and complex forces. We analyze
physical, homophily, and social communities to evaluate their relation with
subjects' behavior. We prove that social influence is correlated with these
communities, and each one of them is (differently) significant for individuals.
We define community-based features, which reflect the subject involvement in
these groups, and we use them with a supervised learning algorithm to predict
subject participation in social events. Results indicate that both communities
and ego network are relevant sources of social influence, confirming that the
ego network alone is not sufficient to explain this phenomenon. Moreover, we
classify users according to the degree of social influence they experienced
with respect to their groups, recognizing classes of behavioral phenotypes. To
our knowledge, this is the first work that proves the existence of phenotypes
related to the social influence phenomenon.

Recently, quantum coherent effects have been discovered in photosynthetic light

Here, we perform an experimental quantum simulation of photosynthetic energy
transfer using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). We show that an N- chromophore
photosynthetic complex, with arbitrary structure and bath spectral density, can

of simulating such a system with a theoretical tool, like the hierarchical

requiring a just polynomial number of qubits N using NMR quantum simulation.
The benefits of performing such quantum simulation in NMR are even greater when

It is common practice to host multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) on the same

manual effort for optimization, e.g. by consolidating VM placement based on
changes in usage patterns. Many resource management algorithms and frameworks
have been developed to automate this process. Resource management algorithms
are typically tested via experimentation or using simulation. The main drawback
of both approaches is the high effort required to conduct the testing. Existing
Cloud or IaaS simulators require the algorithm engineer to reimplement their

to define the workload model used for algorithm testing. We propose an approach

Via an algebraic connection, this reduces to the study of restricted partial

self-dual and idempotent). First, we study the language classes themselves. We
classify the structure of the least restrictive pSDI-operations, corresponding
to the most powerful languages $\Gamma$, and find that these operations can be
divided into \emph{levels}, corresponding to a rough notion of difficulty; and
that within each level there is a strongest operation (the partial $k$-NU
operation, preserving $(k-1)$-SAT) and a weakest operation (the $k$-universal
operation $u_k$, preserving problems definable via bounded-degree polynomials).
We show that every sign-symmetric $\Gamma$ not preserved by $u_k$ implements
all $k$-clauses; thus if $\Gamma$ is not preserved by $u_k$ for any $k$, then
SAT($\Gamma$) is trivially SETH-hard and cannot be solved faster than
$O^*(2^n)$ unless SETH fails.
  Second, we study upper and lower bounds for SAT($\Gamma$) for such languages.
We show that several classes in the hierarchy correspond to problems which can
be solved faster than $2^n$ using previously known algorithmic strategies such
as Subset Sum-style meet-in-the-middle and fast matrix multiplication.
Furthermore, if the sunflower conjecture holds for sunflowers with k sets, then
the partial k-NU language has an improved algorithm via local search.
Complementing this, we show that for every class there is a concrete lower
bound $c$ such that SAT($\Gamma$) cannot be solved faster than $O^*(c^n)$ for
all problems in the class unless SETH fails. This gives the first known case of
a SAT-problem which simultaneously has non-trivial upper and lower bounds under

speed of the jet depends on how much thermal energy is converted into jet
momentum and how much radiation momentum is deposited on to the jet. Many
classes of jet solutions with single sonic points, multiple sonic points as
well as, those having radiation driven internal shocks are obtained. Variation
of all flow variables along the jet-axis has been studied. Highly energetic
electron-proton jets can be accelerated by intense radiation to terminal
Lorentz factors $\gamma_{\rm \small T} \sim 3$. Moderate terminal speed $v_{\rm
\small T} \sim 0.5$ is obtained for moderately luminous discs. Lepton dominated
jets may achieve $\gamma_{\rm \small T} \sim 10$. Thermal driving of the jet
itself and radiation driving by accretion disc photons produce a wide-ranging
jet solutions staring from moderately strong jets to the relativistic ones.
Interplay of intensity and nature of radiation field and the energetics of the

dilute Bose gas, partially reviewing results obtained earlier, thereby
extending, complementing, generalizing and straightening them out. We study
universal dynamics after a cooling quench, focusing on situations where the
time evolution represents a pure rescaling of spatial correlations, with time
defining the scale parameter. The non-equilibrium initial condition set by the
quench induces a redistribution of particles in momentum space. Depending on
conservation laws, this can take the form of a wave-turbulent flux or of a more
general self-similar evolution, signaling the critically slowed approach to a
non-thermal fixed point. We identify such fixed points using a non-perturbative
kinetic theory of collective scattering between highly occupied long-wavelength
modes. In contrast, a wave-turbulent flux, possible in the perturbative
Boltzmann regime, builds up in a critically accelerated self-similar manner. A
key result is the simple analytical universal scaling form of the
non-perturbative many-body scattering matrix, for which we lay out the concrete
conditions under which it applies. We derive the scaling exponents for the time
evolution as well as for the power-law tail of the momentum distribution
function, for a general dynamical critical exponent $z$ and an anomalous
scaling dimension $\eta$. The approach of the non-thermal fixed point is, in
particular, found to involve a rescaling of momenta in time $t$ by $t^{\beta}$,
with $\beta=1/z$, within our kinetic approach independent of $\eta$. We confirm
our analytical predictions by numerically evaluating the kinetic scattering
integral as well as the non-perturbative many-body coupling function. As a side
result we obtain a possible finite-size interpretation of wave-turbulent
scaling recently measured by Navon et al.

simulations of multi-species plasmas. The oscillation frequency obtained is
compared with predictions based on single-species simulations using simplified

the influence of the different inter-species collisions is studied in detail.
It is concluded that taking into account multiple kinetic ions and electrons

validate by experimenting on a larger and comprehensive dataset than has been
attempted until now. Our experiments provide insights on the use of different
feature extraction models for different disciplines. More importantly, we
identify that a naive active learning based screening process is biased in

their potential as a future energy resource. There are significant economical
and environmental risks associated with extraction from hydrate reservoirs, so
a variety of multiphysics models have been developed to analyze prospective
risks and benefits. These models generally have a large number of empirical
parameters which are not known a priori. Traditional optimization-based
parameter estimation frameworks may be ill-posed or computationally
prohibitive. Bayesian inference methods have increasingly been found effective
for estimating parameters in complex geophysical systems. These methods often
are not viable in cases of computationally expensive models and
high-dimensional parameter spaces. Recently, methods have been developed to
effectively reduce the dimension of Bayesian inverse problems by identifying
low-dimensional structures that are most informed by data. Active subspaces is
one of the most generally applicable methods of performing this dimension
reduction. In this paper, Bayesian inference of the parameters of a
state-of-the-art mathematical model for methane hydrates based on experimental
data from a triaxial compression test with gas hydrate-bearing sand is
performed in an efficient way by utilizing active subspaces. Active subspaces
are used to identify low-dimensional structure in the parameter space which is
exploited by generating a cheap regression-based surrogate model and
implementing a modified Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Posterior densities
having means that match the experimental data are approximated in a
computationally efficient way.

we can trade off the size of the authorized sets with the amount of
communication required for reconstruction. Based on the staircase codes,
proposed by Bitar and El Rouayheb, we propose a class of quantum threshold
secret sharing schemes that are also communication efficient. We call them
$((k,2k-1,d))$ communication efficient quantum secret sharing schemes where
$k\leq d\leq2k-1$. Using the proposed construction, we can recover a secret of
$d-k+1$ qudits by communicating $d$ qudits whereas using the standard
$((k,2k-1))$ quantum secret sharing requires $k(d-k+1)$ qudits to be
communicated. In other words, to share a secret of one qudit, the standard
quantum secret sharing requires $k$ qudits whereas the proposed schemes
communicate only $\frac{d}{d-k+1}$ qudits per qudit in the communication
complexity. Proposed schemes can reduce communication overheads by a factor
$O(k)$ with respect to standard schemes, when $d$ equals $2k-1$. Further, we
show that our schemes have optimal communication cost for secret
reconstruction.

continuous-time Markov chains. We prove that: (i) the computed approximations
bound the measures from below; (ii) the total variation distances between the
approximations and the measures decrease monotonically as states are added to
the truncation; and (iii) the scheme converges, in the sense that, as the
truncation tends to the entire state space, the total variation distances tend
to zero. Furthermore, we give a computable bound on the total variation
distance between the exit distribution and its approximation, and we delineate
the cases in which the bound is sharp. We also revisit the related finite state
projection scheme and give a comprehensive account of its theoretical

thin film on the same surface. We study systematically this elastowetting of
gel spheres on substrates of different surface energies, and find that their
contact angle increases as the work of adhesion between the gel and the
substrate decreases, as one would observe for drops of pure water - albeit
being larger than in the latter case. This difference in the contact angles of
gel and water appears to be due to the elastic shear stresses that develop in
the gel and oppose its spreading. Indeed, by increasing the elastic modulus of
the gel spheres, we find that their contact angle also increases. In addition,
the length of the contact foot increases with the work of adhesion and sphere
size, while it decreases when the elastic modulus of the gel is increased. We

along the jet is about 5-14 just before the instability occurs, and it is even
higher than 14 at some local areas. During the K-H instability process, several
vortex-like plasma blobs of high temperature and high density appear along the
jet, and magnetic fields have also been rolled up and the magnetic
configuration including anti-parallel magnetic fields forms, which leads to
magnetic reconnection at many X-points and current sheet fragments inside the
vortex-like blob. After magnetic islands appear inside the main current sheet,
the total kinetic energy of the reconnection outflows decreases, and cannot
support the formation of the vortex-like blob along the jet any longer, then
the K-H instability eventually disappears. We also present the results about
how the guide field and the flux emerging speed affect the K-H instability. We
find that the strong guide field inhibits the shock formation in the
reconnection upward outflow regions but helps secondary magnetic islands appear
earlier in the main current sheet, and then apparently suppresses the K-H
instability. As the speed of the emerging magnetic field decreases, the K-H
instability appears later, the highest temperature inside the vortex blob gets
lower and the vortex structure gets smaller.

sediments offers the opportunity of inferring information on past climate
variability. Often, such data sets are univariate and a proper reconstruction
of the system's higher-dimensional phase space can be crucial for further
analyses. In this study, we systematically compare the methods of time delay
embedding and differential embedding for phase space reconstruction.
Differential embedding relates the system's higher-dimensional coordinates to
the derivatives of the measured time series. For implementation, this requires
robust and efficient algorithms to estimate derivatives from noisy and possibly
non-uniformly sampled data. For this purpose, we consider several approaches:
(i) central differences adapted to irregular sampling, (ii) a generalized
version of discrete Legendre coordinates and (iii) the concept of Moving Taylor
Bayesian Regression. We evaluate the performance of differential and time delay
embedding by studying two paradigmatic model systems - the Lorenz and the
R\""ossler system. More precisely, we compare geometric properties of the
reconstructed attractors to those of the original attractors by applying
recurrence network analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the potential and the
limitations of using the different phase space reconstruction methods in
combination with windowed recurrence network analysis for inferring information
about past climate variability. This is done by analyzing two well-studied
paleoclimate data sets from Ecuador and Mexico. We find that studying the
robustness of the results when varying the analysis parameters is an
unavoidable step in order to make well-grounded statements on climate
variability and to judge whether a data set is suitable for this kind of
analysis.

learning. In this letter, we propose to generalize TV regularization by
replacing the l1-penalty with an alternative prior that is trainable.
Specifically, our method learns the prior via extending the recently proposed
fast parallel proximal algorithm (FPPA) to incorporate data-adaptive proximal
operators. The proposed framework does not require additional inner iterations
for evaluating the proximal mappings of the corresponding learned prior.
Moreover, our formalism ensures that the training and reconstruction processes
share the same algorithmic structure, making the end-to-end implementation
intuitive. As an example, we demonstrate our algorithm on the problem of
deconvolution in a fluorescence microscope.

categorical data. Many statistics exist to test the fit of the latent class

always useful. Asymptotic distributions are not always known, and empirical
reference distributions can be very time consuming to obtain. In this paper we
propose a fast resampling scheme with which any type of model fit can be
assessed. We illustrate it here on the latent class model, but the methodology
can be applied in any situation.
  The principle behind the lazy bootstrap method is to specify a statistic
which captures the characteristics of the data that a model should capture
correctly. If those characteristics in the observed data and in model-generated
data are very different we can assume that the model could not have produced
the observed data. With this method we achieve the flexibility of tests from
the Bayesian framework, while only needing maximum likelihood estimates. We
provide a step-wise algorithm with which the fit of a model can be assessed
based on the characteristics we as researcher find important. In a Monte Carlo
study we show that the method has very low type I errors, for all illustrated
statistics. Power to reject a model depended largely on the type of statistic
that was used and on sample size. We applied the method to an empirical data
set on clinical subgroups with risk of Myocardial infarction and compared the
results directly to the parametric bootstrap. The results of our method were
highly similar to those obtained by the parametric bootstrap, while the
required computations differed three orders of magnitude in favour of our

multichannel audio datasets with different number of overlapping sound sources

single-channel versions of the real-life recording TUT-SED 2017 development

470 died from tuberculosis (TB), a disease which was the main cause of death
around 1900. How can one explain such a key discrepancy in treatment progress?
A statistical comparison between TB and cancer will give some clues. However,
TB and cancer also share several important features. Both TB and cancer can
affect several organs, e.g. lungs, brain, bones, intestines, skin. What in
cancer is called malignant neoplasm (tumor) is called granuloma in TB. By
isolating malignant cells (versus bacteria) from the rest of the body, such
clusters protect the host's organism but at the same time they are ""secure
beachheads"" from where malignant cells (versus infected macrophages) can wander
off to new locations. Thus, metastatic tumors have a TB parallel in the form of
secondary granulomas. In order to investigate more closely this parallel we use
the age-specific response of organs. Called spectrometric analysis in a
previous paper (Berrut et al. 2017), this method provides information about how
fast tumors develop and how serious they become. A convenient characterization
of the response to TB of organ j is given by the following (age-dependent)
death ratio: Tj(t)=(death by TB of type j)/(all TB deaths) The development of
cancer tumors can be described by a similar function Cj(t). We compare the
organs' responses in all cases for which specific death data are available. It
appears that for the same organ Tj(t) is similar in shape to Cj(t). For
instance, with regard to brain tumors, both TB and cancer mortality peak around
the age of 10. Such observations may bring to light vulnerabilities in the way
the immune system provides protection to various organs.

technique to mitigate the Multi-User Interference (MUI) and the quantization
distortions in a downlink Multi-User (MU) MIMO system with coarsely Quantized
Constant Envelope (QCE) signals at the transmitter. The transmit signal vector
is optimized for every desired received vector taking into account the QCE
constraint. The optimization is based on maximizing the safety margin to the
decision thresholds of the receiver constellation modulation. Simulation
results show a significant gain in terms of the uncoded Bit Error Ratio (BER)
compared to the existing linear precoding techniques.

principles, allows one to recover kinetic energy at the nanoscale. Our premise
is that very small mechanical excitations, such as those arising from sound
waves propagating through a nanoscale system or similar phenomena, can be quite
generally converted into useful electrical work by applying the same principles
behind conventional adiabatic quantum pumping. The proposal is potentially
useful for nanoscale vibrational energy harvesting where it can have several
advantages. The most important one is that it avoids the use of classical
rectification mechanisms as it is based on what we call geometric
rectification. We show that this geometric rectification results from applying
appropriate but quite general initial conditions to damped harmonic systems
coupled to electronic reservoirs. We analyze an analytically solvable example
consisting of a wire suspended over permanent charges where we find the
condition for maximizing the pumped charge. We also studied the effects of
coupling the system to a capacitor including the effect of current-induced
forces and analyzing the steady-state voltage of operation. Finally, we show
how quantum effects can be used to boost the performance of the proposed
device.

For such a purely mathematical theory the physical connotation must pertain
only the interpretation of the mathematics, ranging from the axioms to the
final theorems. On the contrary, the postulates of the two current major
physical theories either don't have physical interpretation (as for von
Neumann's axioms for quantum theory), or contain physical primitives as
""clock"", ""rigid rod "", ""force"", ""inertial mass"" (as for special relativity and

can firmly rely. Such kind of theory is what I consider to be the solution of

outburst, but no presolar stardust grains from classical novae have been
unambiguously identified yet. Although several studies claimed a nova paternity
for certain grains, the measured and simulated isotopic ratios could only be
reconciled assuming that the grains condensed after the nova ejecta mixed with
a much larger amount of close-to-solar matter. However, the source and
mechanism of this potential post-explosion dilution of the ejecta remains a
mystery. A major problem with previous studies is the small number of
simulations performed and the implied poor exploration of the large nova
parameter space. We report the results of a different strategy, based on a
Monte Carlo technique, that involves the random sampling over the most
important nova model parameters: the white dwarf composition; the mixing of the
outer white dwarf layers with the accreted material before the explosion; the
peak temperature and density; the explosion time scales; and the possible
dilution of the ejecta after the outburst. We discuss and take into account the
systematic uncertainties for both the presolar grain measurements and the
simulation results. Only those simulations that are consistent with all
measured isotopic ratios of a given grain are accepted for further analysis. We
also present the numerical results of the model parameters. We identify 18
presolar grains with measured isotopic signatures consistent with a CO nova
origin, without assuming any dilution of the ejecta. Among these, the grains
G270 2, M11-334-2, G278, M11-347-4, M11-151-4, and Ag2 6 have the highest

photons necessary to measure a signal in high-dispersion spectra. Here we show
that spectrographs with a novel design - in particular a large spectral range -
can open exoplanet characterisation to smaller telescope facilities too. We aim
to demonstrate the concept on a series of spectra of the exoplanet HD 189733 b
taken at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo with the near-infrared spectrograph
GIANO during two transits of the planet. In contrast to absorption in the
Earth's atmosphere (telluric absorption), the planet transmission spectrum
shifts in radial velocity during transit due to the changing orbital motion of
the planet. This allows us to remove the telluric spectrum while preserving the
signal of the exoplanet. The latter is then extracted by cross-correlating the
residual spectra with template models of the planet atmosphere computed through
line-by-line radiative transfer calculations, and containing molecular
absorption lines from water and methane. By combining the signal of many
thousands of planet molecular lines, we confirm the presence of water vapour in
the atmosphere of HD 189733 b at the 5.5-$\sigma$ level. This signal was
measured only in the first of the two observing nights. By injecting and
retrieving artificial signals, we show that the non-detection on the second
night is likely due to an inferior quality of the data. The measured strength
of the planet transmission spectrum is fully consistent with past CRIRES
observations at the VLT, excluding a strong variability in the depth of
molecular absorption lines.

choice theory; they include bribery (unweighted, weighted, swap, shift, ...),
control (by adding or deleting voters or candidates), lobbying in referenda and
others.
  We develop a unifying framework for manipulation models with few types of
people, one of the most commonly studied scenarios. A critical insight of our
framework is to separate the descriptive complexity of the voting rule R from
the number of types of people. This allows us to finally settle the
computational complexity of R-Swap Bribery, one of the most fundamental
manipulation problems. In particular, we prove that R-Swap Bribery is
fixed-parameter tractable when R is Dodgson's rule and Young's rule, when
parameterized by the number of candidates. This way, we resolve a long-standing
open question from 2007 which was explicitly asked by Faliszewski et al. [JAIR
40, 2011].
  Our algorithms reveal that the true hardness of bribery problems often stems
from the complexity of the voting rules. On one hand, we give a fixed-parameter
algorithm parameterized by number of types of people for complex voting rules.
Thus, we reveal that R-Swap Bribery with Dodgson's rule is much harder than
with Condorcet's rule, which can be expressed by a conjunction of linear
inequalities, while Dodson's rule requires quantifier alternation and a bounded
number of disjunctions of linear systems. On the other hand, we give an
algorithm for quantifier-free voting rules which is parameterized only by the
number of conjunctions of the voting rule and runs in time polynomial in the
number of types of people. This way, our framework explains why Shift Bribery
is polynomial-time solvable for the plurality voting rule, making explicit that
the rule is simple in that it can be expressed with a single linear inequality,
and that the number of voter types is polynomial.

homogeneous cooling state is carried out to identify the conditions for
stability of a granular gas of rough hard spheres. The description is based on
the results for the transport coefficients derived from the Boltzmann equation
for inelastic rough hard spheres [Phys. Rev. E 90, 022205 (2014)], which take
into account the complete nonlinear dependence of the transport coefficients
and the cooling rate on the coefficients of normal and tangential restitution.
As expected, linear stability analysis shows that a doubly degenerate
transversal (shear) mode and a longitudinal (""heat"") mode are unstable with
respect to long enough wavelength excitations. The instability is driven by the
shear mode above a certain inelasticity threshold; at larger inelasticity,
however, the instability is driven by the heat mode for an
inelasticity-dependent range of medium roughness. Comparison with the case of a
granular gas of inelastic smooth spheres confirms previous simulation results
about the dual role played by surface friction: while small and large levels of
roughness make the system less unstable than the frictionless system, the
opposite happens at medium roughness. On the other hand, such an intermediate
window of roughness values shrinks as inelasticity increases and eventually
disappears at a certain value, beyond which the rough-sphere gas is always less
unstable than the smooth-sphere gas. A comparison with some preliminary
simulation results shows a very good agreement for conditions of practical
interest.

deformation of a dry granular medium confined inside a Hele-Shaw cell due to
air injection at a constant overpressure high enough to deform it (from 50 to

called pneumatic fractures, i.e. channels empty of beads, and we discuss the
typical deformations of the medium surrounding these structures. In addition we
simulate the diffusion of the fluid overpressure into the medium, comparing it
with the Laplacian solution over time, and relating pressure gradients with
corresponding granular displacements. In the compacting medium we show that the
diffusing pressure field becomes similar to the Laplace solution on the order
of a characteristic time given by properties of the pore fluid, granular medium
and the system size. However, before the diffusing pressure approaches the
Laplace solution on system scale, we find that it resembles the Laplacian field
near the channels, with the highest pressure gradients on the most advanced
channel tips and a screened pressure gradient behind them. We show that the
granular displacements more or less always move in the direction against the
local pressure gradients, and when comparing granular velocities with pressure
gradients in the zone ahead of channels, we observe a Bingham type of rheology
for the granular paste (the mix of air and beads), with an effective viscosity
$\mu\_B$ and displacement thresholds $\nabla P\_c$ evolving during mobilization
and compaction of the medium. Such a rheology, with disorder in the
displacement thresholds, could be responsible for placing the pattern growth at
moderate injection pressures in a universality class like the Dielectric
Breakdown Model with $\eta=2$, where fractal dimensions are found between 1.5

home characteristics. We use this data to test whether a spatially mediated
peer effect can be observed in WSL participation likelihood at the household

modeling assumptions, and also provide one mechanism for addressing problems
associated with correlated unobservables than hazards models which can also be
applied to address the same questions. We build networks of neighborhood based
peers for 16 randomly selected neighborhoods in Las Vegas and test for the
existence of a peer based influence on WSL participation by using a
Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered epidemic spreading model (SEIR), in
which a home can become infected via autoinfection or through contagion from
its infected neighbors. We show that this type of epidemic model can be
directly recast to an additive-multiplicative hazard model, but not to purely

too slow to explain such observations. Recently, it was realized that when a

secondary tearing instabilities is investigated within Hall-MHD for the first
time. In the frame of relativistic MHD, we summarize the main results from Del

spectroscopy with high spectral resolution, high spectral accuracy, and broad
spectral coverage; however, the requirement for dual stabilized femtosecond
lasers hampers its versatility due to the bulky size, high complexity, and high
cost. We here report the first demonstration of dual THz comb spectroscopy
using a single free-running fibre laser. By tuning the cavity-loss-dependent
gain profile with an intracavity Lyot filter together with precise management
of the cavity length and dispersion, dual-wavelength pulsed light beams with
slightly detuned repetition frequencies are generated in a single laser cavity.
Due to sharing of the same cavity, such pulsed light beams suffer from
common-mode fluctuation of the repetition frequency, and hence the
corresponding frequency difference between them is passively stable around a
few hundred hertz within millihertz fluctuation. This considerably stable
frequency difference enables dual THz comb spectroscopy with a single
free-running fibre laser. While greatly reducing the size, complexity, and cost
of the laser source by use of a single free-running fibre laser, the dual THz
comb spectroscopy system maintains a spectral bandwidth and dynamic range of
spectral power comparable to a system equipped with dual stabilized fibre
lasers, and can be effectively applied to high-precision spectroscopy of
acetonitrile gas at atmospheric pressure. The demonstrated results indicate
that this system is an attractive solution for practical applications of not
only THz spectroscopy but also THz-pulse-based measurements.

the morphology and structure of the deposited carbon films. The growth rate of
the deposited carbon film increases by increasing the chamber pressure from 3.3

also increases. At 11.3 kPa and 14 kPa chamber pressure, gaseous carbon atoms
convert into graphite state atoms at a high rate. The gas activation and gas
collision processes vary broadly at varying chamber pressure. The morphology

dissociation of molecular hydrogen into atomic hydrogen varies by varying the

various gravitational theories. It is also obtained that the violation of the

and moreover, the contraction of $4$-index theory generally admits a
non-minimal coupling between geometry and matter field in the Rastall way. This
study also shows that, unlike the Einstein case, the gravitational coupling
constant of $4$-index Rastall theory generally differs from that of the

characteristics from recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) and recurrence
network analysis (RNA) in order to unveil some key nonlinear features of the
hourly Disturbance storm-time (Dst) index during periods with magnetic storms
and such of normal variability. Our results demonstrate that recurrence-based
measures can serve as excellent tracers for changes in the dynamical complexity
along non-stationary records of geomagnetic activity. In particular, trapping
time (characterizing the typical length of ""laminar phases"" in the observed
dynamics) and recurrence network transitivity (associated with the number of
the system's effective dynamical degrees of freedom) allow for a very good
discrimination between magnetic storm and quiescence phases. In general, some
RQA and RNA characteristics distinguish between storm and non-storm times
equally well or even better than other previously considered nonlinear
characteristics like Hurst exponent or symbolic dynamics based entropy
concepts. Our results point to future potentials of recurrence characteristics
