instability has been shown to influence the scale of the perturbations that
develop at the unstable interface and consequently alter the speed of
propagation of the front. The present authors argued that this is as a result
of a competition between the destabilizing effect of gravity and the
stabilizing effect of the rotation. In the present paper we consider the
extreme limit of high rotation rates in which rotational forces dominate and
gravitational forces may be ignored. The two liquid layers initially form
concentric cylinders, centred on the axis of rotation. The configuration may be
thought of as a fluid-fluid centrifuge. There are two types of perturbation to
the interface that may be considered, an azimuthal perturbation around the
circumference of the interface and a varicose perturbation in the axial
direction along the length of the interface. It is the first of these types of
perturbation that we consider here, and so the flow may be considered
essentially two-dimensional, taking place in a circular domain.
  We carry out a linear stability analysis on a perturbation to the hydrostatic
background state and derive a fourth order Orr-Sommerfeld-like equation that
governs the system. We consider the dynamics of systems of stable and unstable
configurations, inviscid and viscous fluids, immiscible fluid layers with
surface tension, and miscible fluid layers that may have some initial diffusion
of density. Theoretical predictions are compared with numerical experiments and
the agreement is shown to be good. We do not restrict our analysis to equal
volume fluid layers and so our results also have applications in coating and
lubrication problems in rapidly rotating systems and machinery.

the gap between the code and the physical system. To reduce this difference,
often named model bias, discrepancy, or model error, computer codes are
generally complexified in order to make them more realistic. These improvements
lead to time consuming codes. Moreover, a code often depends on parameters to
be set by the user to make the code as close as possible to field data. This
estimation task is called calibration. This paper proposes a review of Bayesian

electroencephalogram (EEG) and enhanced synchrony at 3-7 and 7-30 Hz in the
basal ganglia, thalamus, and cortex. This study describes the dynamics of a
physiologically based mean-field model of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical
system, and shows how it accounts for key electrophysiological correlates of
PD. Its connectivity comprises partially segregated direct and indirect
pathways through the striatum, a hyperdirect pathway involving a
corticosubthalamic projection, thalamostriatal feedback, and local inhibition
in striatum and external pallidum (GPe). In a companion paper, realistic
steady-state firing rates were obtained for the healthy state, and after
dopamine loss modeled by weaker direct and stronger indirect pathways, reduced
intrapallidal inhibition, lower firing thresholds of the GPe and subthalamic
nucleus (STN), a stronger striato-GPe projection, and weaker cortical
interactions. Here we show that oscillations around 5 and 20 Hz can arise with
a strong indirect pathway, which also increases synchrony throughout the basal
ganglia. Further, increased theta power with nigrostriatal degeneration
correlates with reduced alpha power and peak frequency, matching experiments.
Unlike the hyperdirect pathway, the indirect pathway sustains oscillations with
realistic phase relationships. Changes in basal ganglia responses to transient
stimuli accord with experimental data. Reduced cortical gains due to both
nigrostriatal and mesocortical dopamine loss lead to slower cortical activity
changes and may be related to bradykinesia. Finally, increased EEG power found
in some studies may be partly explained by a lower effective GPe firing
threshold, reduced GPe-GPe inhibition, and/or weaker intracortical connections
in PD. Strict separation of the direct and indirect pathways is not necessary
for these results.

ganglia-thalamocortical system (BGTCS), often including elevated discharge
rates of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the output nuclei, and reduced
activity of the globus pallidus external segment (GPe). These rate changes have
been explained qualitatively in terms of the direct/indirect pathway model,
involving projections of distinct striatal populations to the output nuclei and
GPe. Although these populations partly overlap, evidence suggests dopamine
depletion differentially affects cortico-striato-pallidal connection strengths
to the two pallidal segments. Dopamine loss may also decrease the striatal
signal-to-noise ratio, reducing both corticostriatal coupling and striatal
firing thresholds. Here we present a mean-field model of the BGTCS with
structure and parameter estimates closely based on physiology and anatomy.
Changes in firing rates due to modeled dopamine loss are compared with
experiment. Our results suggest that a stronger indirect pathway, possibly
combined with a weakened direct pathway, is compatible with empirical evidence.
However, altered corticostriatal connection strengths are probably not solely
responsible for substantially increased STN activity often found. A lower STN
firing threshold, weaker intracortical inhibition, and stronger striato-GPe
inhibition help explain the relatively large increase in STN rate. Changes in
cortex, GPe, and STN help normalize the cortical rate, also in accord with
experiments. The model integrates the basal ganglia into a unified framework
along with an existing thalamocortical model that accounts for a wide range of
electrophysiological phenomena. A companion paper discusses the dynamics and
oscillations of this combined system.

the importance of this distinction for understanding how sensory networks
encode information collectively, no method exists to reliably separate
intrinsic interactions from extrinsic correlations in neural activity data,
limiting our ability to build predictive models of the network response. In
this paper we introduce a general strategy to infer {population models of

disentangling intrinsic from extrinsic correlations is to infer the {couplings
between neurons} separately from the encoding model, and to combine the two
using corrections calculated in a mean-field approximation. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach on retinal recordings. The same coupling network
is inferred from responses to radically different stimulus ensembles, showing
that these couplings indeed reflect stimulus-independent interactions between
neurons. The inferred model predicts accurately the collective response of
retinal ganglion cell populations as a function of the stimulus.

this paper we firstly characterise such adversarial attacks as using
obfuscation and polarity transformations. The former deceives by corrupting
toxic trigger content with typographic edits, whereas the latter deceives by
grammatical negation of the toxic content. Then, we propose a two--stage
approach to counter--attack these anomalies, bulding upon a recently proposed
text deobfuscation method and the toxicity scoring model. Lastly, we conducted
an experiment with approximately 24000 distorted comments, showing how in this
way it is feasible to restore toxicity of the adversarial variants, while
incurring roughly on a twofold increase in processing time. Even though novel
adversary challenges would keep coming up derived from the versatile nature of
written language, we anticipate that techniques combining machine learning and

(SMA) data for a sample of 12 strongly lensed galaxies selected at 500$\mu$m in
the Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey H-ATLAS. A previous
analysis of the same dataset used a single S\`ersic profile to model the light
distribution of each background galaxy. Here we model the source brightness
distribution with an adaptive pixel scale scheme, extended to work in the
Fourier visibility space of interferometry. We also present new SMA
observations for seven other candidate lensed galaxies from the H-ATLAS sample.
Our derived lens model parameters are in general consistent with previous
findings. However, our estimated magnification factors, ranging from 3 to 10,
are lower. The discrepancies are observed in particular where the reconstructed
source hints at the presence of multiple knots of emission. We define an
effective radius of the reconstructed sources based on the area in the source
plane where emission is detected above 5$\sigma$. We also fit the reconstructed
source surface brightness with an elliptical Gaussian model. We derive a median
value $r_{eff}\,\sim 1.77\,$kpc and a median Gaussian full width at half
maximum $\sim1.47\,$kpc. After correction for magnification, our sources have
intrinsic star formation rates SFR$\,\sim900-3500\,M_{\odot}yr^{-1}$, resulting
in a median star formation rate surface density
$\Sigma_{SFR}\sim132\,M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$ (or $\sim 218\,M_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$ for the Gaussian fit). This is consistent with what
observed for other star forming galaxies at similar redshifts, and is
significantly below the Eddington limit for a radiation pressure regulated
starburst.

non-linear creep function is used in the model. The EVP deformation of clay is
integrated considering a reference surface and loading surface. An image
parameter is deduced to establish the image surface. The strain rate tensor of
the model comprises elastic-strain-rate tensor and viscoplastic-strain-rate

single surface ellipses. Parameters of the model can be extracted from
conventional oedometer and triaxial tests. The model performance is validated
by capturing the behaviours in creep test, relaxation test, strain-rate effect
test, and over consolidation ratio effect test of Kaolin clay, Hong Kong Marine
Deposit clay, and Fukakusa clay. The model is also implemented in a Finite

swirling turbulent flow driven by counter-rotating bladed disks reveals an
apparent breaking of the law of similarity. Potentially, such breakdown could
arise from several possible factors, including dependence on dimensionless
numbers other that $Re$ or velocity coupling to other fields such as
temperature. However, careful redesign and calibration of the experiment showed
that this unexpected result was due to background errorscaused by minute
misalignments which lead to a noisy and irreproducible torque signal at low
rotation speeds and prevented correct background subtraction normally ascribed
to frictional losses. An important lesson to be learnt is that multiple minute
misalignments can nonlinearly couple to the torque signal and provide a dc
offset that cannot be removed by averaging. That offset can cause the observed
divergence of the friction coefficient C_f from its constant value observed in
the turbulent regime. To minimize the friction and misalignments, we
significantly modified the experimental setup and carried out the experiment
with one bladed disk where the disk, torque meter and motor shaft axes can be
aligned with significantly smaller error, close to the torque meter resolution.
As a result we made precise measurements with high resolution and sensitivity
of the small torques produced for low rotation speeds for several
water-glycerin solutions of different viscosities and confirmed the similarity
law in a wide range of Re in particular in low viscosity fluids.

a lowdimensional manifold of an image allows for easier statistical comparisons
between groups and the synthesis of group representatives. Previous studies
have sought to identify the best mapping of brain MRI to a low-dimensional

In this work, we use deep learning techniques to investigate implicit manifolds
of normal brains and generate new, high-quality images. We explore implicit
manifolds by addressing the problems of image synthesis and image denoising as
important tools in manifold learning. First, we propose the unsupervised
synthesis of T1-weighted brain MRI using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
by learning from 528 examples of 2D axial slices of brain MRI. Synthesized
images were first shown to be unique by performing a crosscorrelation with the
training set. Real and synthesized images were then assessed in a blinded
manner by two imaging experts providing an image quality score of 1-5. The
quality score of the synthetic image showed substantial overlap with that of
the real images. Moreover, we use an autoencoder with skip connections for
image denoising, showing that the proposed method results in higher PSNR than
FSL SUSAN after denoising. This work shows the power of artificial networks to
synthesize realistic imaging data, which can be used to improve image
processing techniques and provide a quantitative framework to structural
changes in the brain.

reviewed. These are responsible for the afterglow emission from which much of
our understanding of gamma-ray bursts derives. Initially, the blast waves are
confined to the dense medium surrounding the burster (stellar envelope or dense
wind), giving rise to a jet-cocoon structure. A massive ejecta is released and
potentially fed by ongoing energy release from the burster and a
forward-reverse shock system is set up between ejecta and ambient density.
Ultimately the blast wave spreads sideways and slows down, and the dominant
afterglow emission shifts from X-rays down to radio. Over the past years
significant progress has been made both observationally and
theoretically/numerically in our understanding of these blast waves, unique in
the universe due to their often incredibly high initial Lorentz factors of
100-1000. The recent discovery of a short gamma-ray burst counterpart to a
gravitational wave detection (GW 170817) brings the promise of a completely new
avenue to explore and constrain the dynamics of gamma-ray burst blast waves.

The CIV forest is a weaker tracer of large-scale structure than the Ly$\alpha$
forest, but benefits from being accessible at redshifts $z<2$ where the quasar
number density from eBOSS is high. Our data sample consists of 287,651 CIV
forest quasars in the redshift range $1.4<z<3.5$ and 387,315 tracer quasars
with $1.2<z<3.5$. We measure large-scale correlations from CIV absorption
occuring in three distinct quasar rest-frame wavelength bands of the spectra
referred to as the CIV forest, the SiIV forest and the Ly$\alpha$ forest. From
the combined fit to the quasar-CIV cross-correlations for the CIV forest and
the SiIV forest, the CIV redshift-space distortion parameter is $\beta_{\rm
CIV}=0.27_{\ -0.14}^{\ +0.16}$ and its combination with the CIV linear
transmission bias parameter is $b_{\rm CIV}(1+\beta_{\rm CIV})=-0.0183_{\
-0.0014}^{\ +0.0013}$ ($1\sigma$ statistical error) at the mean redshift
$z=2.00$. Splitting the sample at $z=2.2$ to constrain the bias evolution with
redshift yields the power-law exponent $\gamma=0.60\pm0.63$, indicating a
significantly weaker redshift-evolution than for the Ly$\alpha$ forest linear
transmission bias. We demonstrate that CIV absorption has the potential to be
used as a probe of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). While the current data
set is insufficient for a detection of the BAO peak feature, the final quasar
samples for redshifts $1.4<z<2.2$ from eBOSS and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic

scale to $\sim7\%$ and $\sim3\%$ precision, respectively, at $z\simeq1.6$.

models can also unveil novel features of neuronal interactions, which are found
to be dominated by pairwise interactions during wakefulness, but are
population-wide during deep sleep. In particular, inhibitory neurons are
observed to be strongly tuned to the inhibitory population. Overall, we

the potential landscape along the nanowire, tuning its conductance to a
quasi-ballistic regime. At high magnetic field ($B$), we observe approximately
quantized conductance plateaus associated with the first two spin-polarized
one-dimensional modes. For $B < 1$ T, the onset of superconductivity occurs in
concomitance with the development of sizeable charge localization leading to a
0.7-type conductance anomaly. In this regime, the proximity supercurrent
exhibits an unusual, non-monotonic $B$ dependence. We interpret this finding in
terms of a competition between the Kondo effect, dominating near $B=0$, and the
Zeeman effect, enforcing spin polarization and the emergence of a $\pi$ phase
shift in the Josephson relation at higher $B$.

steps in implementing large-scale learning algorithms. Randomly shuffling the
data-set among a cluster of workers allows different nodes to obtain fresh data
assignments at each learning epoch. This process has been shown to provide
improvements in the learning process. However, the statistical benefits of
distributed data shuffling come at the cost of extra communication overhead
from the master node to worker nodes, and can act as one of the major
bottlenecks in the overall time for computation. There has been significant
recent interest in devising approaches to minimize this communication overhead.
One approach is to provision for extra storage at the computing nodes. The
other emerging approach is to leverage coded communication to minimize the
overall communication overhead.
  The focus of this work is to understand the fundamental trade-off between the
amount of storage and the communication overhead for distributed data
shuffling. In this work, we first present an information theoretic formulation
for the data shuffling problem, accounting for the underlying problem
parameters (number of workers, $K$, number of data points, $N$, and the
available storage, $S$ per node). We then present an information theoretic
lower bound on the communication overhead for data shuffling as a function of
these parameters. We next present a novel coded communication scheme and show
that the resulting communication overhead of the proposed scheme is within a
multiplicative factor of at most $\frac{K}{K-1}$ from the information-theoretic
lower bound. Furthermore, we present the aligned coded shuffling scheme for
some storage values, which achieves the optimal storage vs communication
trade-off for $K<5$, and further reduces the maximum multiplicative gap down to
$\frac{K-\frac{1}{3}}{K-1}$, for $K\geq 5$.

itself are presented. The ambiguity, discontinuity, and inappropriateness of
the metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, and Jaccard index, which are
currently used in the literature, are analyzed. A numerical example
demonstrates the advantages of RMSMD over the four existing metrics that fail
to distinguish qualities of different nanoscopy images in certain conditions.
The unbiased Gaussian estimator that achieves the Fisher information and
Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of a single data frame is proposed to benchmark
the quality of localization nanoscopy images and the performance of
localization algorithms. The information-achieving estimator is simulated in an

applying Compton scattering to the transmitted component in an analytic model
may largely overestimates the intrinsic luminosity at large column densities.
(2) Unabsorbed reflection components are commonly observed, suggesting that the
tori are clumpy. (3) Most of CTAGNs show small scattering fractions (<0.5%)
implying a buried AGN nature. (4) Comparison with the results obtained for
Compton-thin AGNs (Kawamuro et al. 2016) suggests that the properties of these

heavier obscuration; we find no evidence that the bulk of the population of

combining stellar dynamics with strong gravitational lensing. However, this
method is limited by degeneracies between the density profile of dark matter
and the stellar mass-to-light ratio. In this work we reduce this degeneracy by
combining weak lensing together with strong lensing and stellar kinematics. Our
analysis is based on two galaxy samples: 45 strong lenses from the SLACS survey
and 1,700 massive quiescent galaxies from the SDSS main spectroscopic sample
with weak lensing measurements from the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey. We use a
Bayesian hierarchical approach to jointly model all three observables. We fit
the data with models of varying complexity and show that a model with a radial
gradient in the stellar mass-to-light ratio is required to simultaneously
describe both galaxy samples. This result is driven by a subset of strong
lenses with very steep total density profile, that cannot be fitted by models
with no gradient. Our measurements are unable to determine whether $M_*/L$
gradients are due to variations in stellar population parameters at fixed IMF,
or to gradients in the IMF itself. The inclusion of $M_*/L$ gradients decreases
dramatically the inferred IMF normalisation, compared to previous lensing-based
studies, with the exact value depending on the assumed dark matter profile. The
main effect of strong lensing selection is to shift the stellar mass
distribution towards the high mass end, while the halo mass and stellar IMF
distribution at fixed stellar mass are not significantly affected.

phrases or text as a low dimensional vector (typically 50-500 dimensions).
However, it is difficult to interpret these dimensions in a meaningful manner,
and creating neural embeddings requires extensive training and tuning of
multiple parameters and hyperparameters. We present here a simple unsupervised
method for representing words, phrases or text as a low dimensional vector, in
which the meaning and relative importance of dimensions is transparent to
inspection. We have created a near-comprehensive vector representation of
words, and selected bigrams, trigrams and abbreviations, using the set of
titles and abstracts in PubMed as a corpus. This vector is used to create
several novel implicit word-word and text-text similarity metrics. The implicit
word-word similarity metrics correlate well with human judgement of word pair
similarity and relatedness, and outperform or equal all other reported methods
on a variety of biomedical benchmarks, including several implementations of
neural embeddings trained on PubMed corpora. Our implicit word-word metrics
capture different aspects of word-word relatedness than word2vec-based metrics
and are only partially correlated (rho = ~0.5-0.8 depending on task and
corpus). The vector representations of words, bigrams, trigrams, abbreviations,
and PubMed title+abstracts are all publicly available from
http://arrowsmith.psych.uic.edu for release under CC-BY-NC license. Several
public web query interfaces are also available at the same site, including one
which allows the user to specify a given word and view its most closely related
terms according to direct co-occurrence as well as different implicit
similarity metrics.

light-cones generated from cosmological simulations. In order to assess the
prospects of such observable as a cosmological probe, we consider simulations
that include interacting Dark Energy (hereafter DE) models with coupling term
between DE and Dark Matter. Cosmological models that produce a larger
population of massive clusters have more numerous high signal-to-noise peaks;
among models with comparable numbers of clusters those with more concentrated
haloes produce more peaks. The most extreme model under investigation shows a
difference in peak counts of about $20\%$ with respect to the reference
$\mathrm{\Lambda}$CDM model. We find that peak statistics can be used to
distinguish a coupling DE model from a reference one with the same power
spectrum normalisation. The differences in the expansion history and the growth
rate of structure formation are reflected in their halo counts, non-linear
scale features and, through them, in the properties of the lensing peaks. For a
source redshift distribution consistent with the expectations of future
space-based wide field surveys, we find that typically seventy percent of the
cluster population contributes to weak-lensing peaks with signal-to-noise
ratios larger than two, and that the fraction of clusters in peaks approaches
one-hundred percent for haloes with redshift z$\leq$0.5. Our analysis
demonstrates that peak statistics are an important tool for disentangling DE
models by accurately tracing the structure formation processes as a function of
the cosmic time.

Keck/ESI spectra to disentangle the dark and luminous contributions to the
mass. Assuming a gNFW profile for the dark matter halo and a spatially constant
stellar-mass-to-light ratio $\Upsilon_{\star}$ for the baryonic mass, we infer
distributions for $\Upsilon_{\star}$ consistent with IMFs that are heavier than
the Milky Way's (with a global mean mismatch parameter relative to a Chabrier
IMF $\mu_{\alpha c} = 1.80 \pm 0.14$) and halo inner density slopes which span
a large range but are generally cuspier than the dark-matter-only prediction
($\mu_{\gamma'} = 2.01_{-0.22}^{+0.19}$). We investigate possible reasons for
overestimating the halo slope, including the neglect of spatially varying
stellar-mas-to-light ratios and/or stellar orbital anisotropy, and find that a
quarter of the systems prefer radially declining stellar-mass-to-light ratio
gradients, but that the overall effect on our inference on the halo slope is
small. We suggest a coherent explanation of these results in the context of
inside-out galaxy growth, and that the relative importance of different
baryonic processes in shaping the dark halo may depend on halo environment.

Large Binocular Telescope's Multi-Object Double Spectrograph. From our analysis
of the optical spectra, we argue that the gas in the ULX-1 bubble is
shock-ionized, consistent with the effect of a jet with a kinetic power of
$\approx$2 $\times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Additional X-ray photo-ionization may
also be present, to explain the strength of high-ionization lines such as He II
$\lambda 4686$ and [Ne V] $\lambda 3426$. On the other hand, the emission lines
from the ULX-2 bubble are typical for photoionization by normal O stars
suggesting that the nebula is actually an H II region not physically related to
the ULX but is simply a chance alignment. From archival Very Large Array data,
we also detect spatially extended, steep-spectrum radio emission at the

were somewhat unexpected given a dearth of previous non-detections in this era
when the intergalactic medium (IGM) is still highly neutral. But these
detections were from UV bright galaxies, which preferentially live in
overdensities which reionize early, and have significantly Doppler-shifted
Ly$\alpha$ line profiles emerging from their interstellar media (ISM), making
them less affected by the global IGM state. Using a combination of reionization
simulations and empirical ISM models we show, as a result of these two effects,
UV bright galaxies in overdensities have $>2\times$ higher transmission through
the $z\sim7$ IGM than typical field galaxies, and this boosted transmission is
enhanced as the neutral fraction increases. The boosted transmission is not
sufficient to explain the observed high Ly$\alpha$ fraction of $M_\mathrm{UV}
\lesssim -22$ galaxies (Stark et al. 2017), suggesting Ly$\alpha$ emitted by
these galaxies must be stronger than expected due to enhanced production and/or
selection effects. Despite the bias of UV bright galaxies to reside in
overdensities we show Ly$\alpha$ observations of such galaxies can accurately
measure the global neutral hydrogen fraction, particularly when Ly$\alpha$ from
UV faint galaxies is extinguished, making them ideal candidates for
spectroscopic follow-up into the cosmic Dark Ages.

by the presence of convective motions and turbulent flows which shape the
emergent spectrum.
  Aims. We used realistic three-dimensional radiative hydrodynamical
simulations from the Stagger-grid to calculate synthetic spectra with the
radiative transfer code Optim3D for stars with different stellar parameters to
predict photometric colors and convective velocity shifts.
  Methods. We calculated spectra from 1000 to 200 000 A with a constant
resolving power of 20 000 and from 8470 and 8710 A (Gaia Radial Velocity
Spectrometer - RVS - spectral range), with a constant resolving power of 300
000.
  Results. We used synthetic spectra to compute theoretical colors in the
Johnson-Cousins UBV(RI), SDSS, 2MASS, Gaia, SkyMapper, Stromgren systems, and
HST-WFC3. We showed that 1D versus 3D differences are limited to a small
percent except for the narrow filters that span the optical and UV region of
the spectrum. In addition, we derived the effect of the convective velocity
fields on selected Fe I lines. We found the overall convective shift for 3D
simulations with respect to the reference 1D hydrostatic models, revealing line
shifts of between -0.235 and +0.361 km/s. We showed a net correlation of the
convective shifts with the effective temperature: lower effective temperatures
denote redshifts and higher effective temperatures denote blueshifts. We
conclude that the extraction of accurate radial velocities from RVS spectra
need an appropriate wavelength correction from convection shifts.
  Conclusions. The use of realistic 3D hydrodynamical stellar atmosphere
simulations has a small but significant impact on the predicted photometry
compared with classical 1D hydrostatic models for late-type stars. We make all
the spectra publicly available for the community through the POLLUX database.

implement constant-resource behavior. Our type system extends recent work on
automatic amortized resource analysis (AARA), a set of techniques that
automatically derive provable upper bounds on the resource consumption of
programs. We devise new techniques that build on the potential method to
achieve compositionality, precision, and automation.
  A strict global requirement that a program always maintains constant resource
usage is too restrictive for most practical applications. It is sufficient to
require that the program's resource behavior remain constant with respect to an
attacker who is only allowed to observe part of the program's state and
behavior. To account for this, our type system incorporates information flow
tracking into its resource analysis. This allows our system to certify programs
that need to violate the constant-time requirement in certain cases, as long as
doing so does not leak confidential information to attackers. We formalize this
guarantee by defining a new notion of resource-aware noninterference, and prove
that our system enforces it.
  Finally, we show how our type inference algorithm can be used to synthesize a
constant-time implementation from one that cannot be verified as secure,
effectively repairing insecure programs automatically. We also show how a
second novel AARA system that computes lower bounds on resource usage can be
used to derive quantitative bounds on the amount of information that a program
leaks through its resource use. We implemented each of these systems in
Resource Aware ML, and show that it can be applied to verify constant-time
behavior in a number of applications including encryption and decryption
routines, database queries, and other resource-aware functionality.

ordinary Kripke-Platek set theory, KP, in several ways it behaves quite
differently from KP. This is perhaps most strikingly demonstrated by a result,
due to Mathias, to the effect that adding the axiom of constructibility to KPP
gives rise to a much stronger theory, whereas in the case of KP the
constructible hierarchy provides an inner model, so that KP and KP+V=L have the
same strength. This paper will be concerned with the relationship between KPP
and KPP plus the axiom of choice or even the global axiom of choice, GAC. Since
L is the standard vehicle to furnish a model in which this axiom holds, the
usual argument for demonstrating that the addition of AC or GAC to KPP does not
increase proof-theoretic strength does not apply in any obvious way. Among
other tools, the paper uses techniques from ordinal analysis to show that
KPP+GAC has the same strength as KPP, thereby answering a question of Mathias.
Moreover, it is shown that KPP+GAC is conservative over KPP for Pi-1-4
statements of analysis. The method of ordinal analysis for theories with power
set was developed in an earlier paper. The technique allows one to compute
witnessing information from infinitary proofs, providing bounds for the
transfinite iterations of the power set operation that are provable in a
theory. As the theory KPP+GAC provides a very useful tool for defining models
and realizability models of other theories that are hard to construct without
access to a uniform selection mechanism, it is desirable to determine its exact
proof-theoretic strength. This knowledge can for instance be used to determine
the strength of Feferman's operational set theory with power set operation as
well as constructive Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice.

contrary, outliers are defined by the concept of cluster, which are recognized
as the points belonging to none of the clusters. Unfortunately, most existing
studies do not notice the coupled relationship between these two task and
handle them separately. In light of this, we consider the joint cluster
analysis and outlier detection problem, and propose the Clustering with Outlier
Removal (COR) algorithm. Generally speaking, the original space is transformed
into the binary space via generating basic partitions in order to define
clusters. Then an objective function based Holoentropy is designed to enhance
the compactness of each cluster with a few outliers removed. With further
analyses on the objective function, only partial of the problem can be handled
by K-means optimization. To provide an integrated solution, an auxiliary binary
matrix is nontrivally introduced so that COR completely and efficiently solves
the challenging problem via a unified K-means-- with theoretical supports.
Extensive experimental results on numerous data sets in various domains
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of COR significantly over
state-of-the-art methods in terms of cluster validity and outlier detection.
Some key factors in COR are further analyzed for practical use. Finally, an
application on flight trajectory is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness
of COR in the real-world scenario.

this paper, we leverage the formalism of topic model to design a WSD system

in which the topic proportions for a document are replaced by synset
proportions. We further utilize the information in the WordNet by assigning a
non-uniform prior to synset distribution over words and a logistic-normal prior
for document distribution over synsets. We evaluate the proposed method on

in analyzing connectivity and expansion properties of the network, but also
serves as a key parameter in designing efficient algorithms. We introduce a new
notion of mixing of a random walk on a (undirected) graph, called local mixing.
Informally, the local mixing with respect to a given node $s$, is the mixing of
a random walk probability distribution restricted to a large enough subset of
nodes --- say, a subset of size at least $n/\beta$ for a given parameter
$\beta$ --- containing $s$. The time to mix over such a subset by a random walk
starting from a source node $s$ is called the local mixing time with respect to
$s$. The local mixing time captures the local connectivity and expansion
properties around a given source node and is a useful parameter that determines
the running time of algorithms for partial information spreading, gossip etc.
  Our first contribution is formally defining the notion of local mixing time
in an undirected graph. We then present an efficient distributed algorithm
which computes a constant factor approximation to the local mixing time with
respect to a source node $s$ in $\tilde{O}(\tau_s)$ rounds, where $\tau_s$ is
the local mixing time w.r.t $s$ in an $n$-node regular graph. This bound holds
when $\tau_s$ is significantly smaller than the conductance of the local mixing
set (i.e., the set where the walk mixes locally); this is typically the
interesting case where the local mixing time is significantly smaller than the
mixing time (with respect to $s$). We also present a distributed algorithm that
computes the exact local mixing time in $\tilde{O}(\tau_s \mathcal{D})$ rounds,
where $\mathcal{D} =\min\{\tau_s, D\}$ and $D$ is the diameter of the graph. We
further show that local mixing time tightly characterizes the complexity of
partial information spreading.

Comparing the $\gamma$-ray properties of these objects with 3LAC blazars
reveals their spectral shapes to be similar to FSRQs, however, with low
$\gamma$-ray luminosity ($\lesssim10^{46-47}$ erg s$^{-1}$). In the Wide-field

quantum money scheme and so we can construct many different quantum money
schemes based on such a one-way function. Later in the paper, we also give
explicit constructions of some interesting quantum money schemes like quantum

accurately reproduced by a linear perturbation analysis of the angle-averaged

associate the high-frequency noise in the GW spectrograms above the main signal

little power. The collection of models presented here summarizes the dependence
of the CCSN GW signal on the progenitor mass, equation of state, many-body

fit for it as a function of time, which can be used as a prior when looking for

enters in a long-term quenching phase. The outer regions follow this trend but
more gentle as more external they are. As the result, the radial stellar mass
growth is highly inside-out due to both the inside-out structural growth and
inside-out SF quenching. The half-mass radius evolves fast; for instance,
$R_{0.5}$($z=1$)$<0.5$$R_{0.5}$($z=0$). Two other runs resemble lenticular
galaxies. One shows also a pronounced inside-out growth and the other one
presents a nearly uniform radial mass assembly. The other two galaxies suffered
late major mergers. Their normalized radial mass growth histories (MGHs) are
nearly close among them but with periods of outside-in assembly during or after
the mergers. For all the simulations, the archaeological radial MGHs calculated
from the $z = 0$ stellar-particles age distribution are similar to the current
MGHs, which evidences that the mass assembly by ex-situ stars and the radial
mass transport do not change significantly their radial mass distributions. Our
results agree qualitatively with observational inferences from the fossil

enough to sustain a super-Eddington accretion towards the neutron core. The
neutron core may collapse to a black hole after a while. A strong large-scale
outflow or a jet can be launched from the super-Eddington accretion disk and
the collapsing Thorne-Zytkow object can be turned into an explosion. The ejecta
have about 10 Msun but the explosion energy depends on when the accretion is
suppressed. We presume that the explosion energy could be as low as ~ 1e47 erg
and such a low-energy explosion could be observed like a failed supernova. The
maximum possible explosion energy is ~ 1e52 erg and such a high-energy
explosion could be observed as an energetic Type II supernova or a

light $c$ at a few times the nuclear saturation density, independent of the
nuclear Hamiltonian. If QCD obeys the conformal limit, we conclude that the
rapid increase of $c_S$ required to accommodate a $2 $ M$_\odot$ NS suggests a
form of strongly interacting matter where a description in terms of nucleons
will be unwieldy, even between one and two times the nuclear saturation
density. For typical NSs with masses in the range $1.2-1.4~$ M$_\odot$, we find
radii between $10$ and $14$ km, and the smallest possible radius of a $1.4$

196Hg -- the p nuclides -- is due to the contribution from different
nucleosynthesis processes, activated in different types of stars. Whereas these
processes have been subject to various studies, their relative contributions to
Galactic Chemical Evolution are still a matter of debate. We investigate for
the first time the nucleosynthesis of p nuclides in GCE by including
metallicity and progenitor mass-dependent yields of core-collapse supernovae
(ccSNe) into a chemical evolution model. We used a grid of metallicities and
progenitor masses from two different sets of stellar yields and followed the
contribution of ccSNe to the Galactic abundances as function of time. In
combination with previous studies on p-nucleus production in thermonuclear
supernovae (SNIa), and using the same GCE description, this allows us to
compare the respective roles of SNeIa and ccSNe in the production of p-nuclei
in the Galaxy. The gamma process in ccSN is very efficient for a wide range of
progenitor masses (13M_sun_- 25M_sun) at solar metallicity. Since it is a
secondary process with its efficiency depending on the initial abundance of
heavy elements, its contribution is strongly reduced below solar metallicity.
This makes it challenging to explain the inventory of the p nuclides in the
Solar System by the contribution from ccSNe alone. In particular, we find that
ccSNe contribute less than 10% of the solar p nuclide abundances, with only a
few exceptions. Due to the uncertain contribution from other nucleosynthesis
sites in ccSNe, such as neutrino winds or $\alpha$-rich freeze out, we conclude
that the light p-nuclides 74$Se,78$Kr, 84Sr, and 92Mo may either still be
completely or only partially produced in ccSNe.

stability point in the structural constitutive equation of materials to a
divergence of characteristic scales in the microscopic dynamics responsible for
deformation. Avalanche models involving critical failure have determined common
universality classes for stick-slip processes and fracture. However, not all
empirical failure processes exhibit the trademarks of criticality. The
rheological properties of materials introduce dissipation, usually reproduced
in conceptual models as a hardening of the coarse grained elements of the
system. Here, we investigate the effects of transient hardening on (i) the
activity rate and (ii) the statistical properties of avalanches. We find the
explicit representation of transient hardening in the presence of generalized
viscoelasticity and solve the corresponding mean field model of fracture. In
the quasistatic limit, the accelerated energy release is invariant with respect
to rheology and the avalanche propagation can be reinterpreted in terms of a
stochastic counting process. A single universality class can be defined from

that these temporal attacks degrade user privacy across a wide range of
anonymity networks, including deployed systems such as Tor; path-selection
protocols for Tor such as DeNASA, TAPS, and Counter-RAPTOR; and network-layer
anonymity protocols for Internet routing such as Dovetail and HORNET. The
degradation is in some cases surprisingly severe. For example, a single host
failure or network route change could quickly and with high certainty identify
the client's ISP to a malicious host or ISP. The adversary behind each attack
is relatively weak - generally passive and in control of one network location

analyzing anonymity.

systems on $\mathbb Z^d$ with continuous time Markov dynamics of Glauber type,
which represent a natural stochastic (and non-monotone) counterpart of the
family of cellular automata known as $\mathcal U$-bootstrap percolation. KCM
also display some of the peculiar features of the so-called ""glassy dynamics"",
and as such they are extensively used in the physics literature to model the
liquid-glass transition, a major and longstanding open problem in condensed
matter physics.
  We consider two-dimensional KCM with update rule $\mathcal U$, and focus on
proving universality results for the mean infection time of the origin, in the
same spirit as those recently established in the setting of $\mathcal
U$-bootstrap percolation. We first identify what we believe are the correct
universality classes, which turn out to be different from those of $\mathcal
U$-bootstrap percolation. We then prove universal upper bounds on the mean
infection time within each class, which we conjecture to be sharp up to
logarithmic corrections. In certain cases, including all supercritical models,
and the well-known Duarte model, our conjecture has recently been confirmed in
[MMT]. In fact, in these cases our upper bound is sharp up to a constant factor
in the exponent. For certain classes of update rules, it turns out that the
infection time of the KCM diverges much faster than for the corresponding
$\mathcal U$-bootstrap process when the equilibrium density of infected sites
goes to zero. This is due to the occurrence of energy barriers which determine
the dominant behaviour for KCM, but which do not matter for the monotone

theoretical model, $i.e.$ the cell-averaged Green's function formalism combined

neutrality levels in the vicinity of the mid-gap; this is in agreement with
previous reports and analogous to the behavior of three-dimensional
semiconductors. The calculated canonical Schottky barrier heights are also
found to be in agreement with other computational and experimental values in
cases where the difference between electronegativities of the semiconductor and

herein considered and supports that Schottky barrier heights have metal-induced
gap state-derived character, regardless whether spin-orbit coupling
interactions are considered. The results presented within this report

diversity of light curves. We also explore the dynamics of the fallback of the
innermost stellar layers, which might be able to remove radioactive nickel from
the ejecta, making the rapid decline in the late time light curve possible. We
provide scaling relations that describe how the duration and luminosity of

due to the strongly attractive antikaon-nucleon interaction. It is found that
the $1S_{1/2}$ state energy in the high-density core of kaonic nuclei can
directly probe the variation of the symmetry energy at supranormal nuclear
density, and a sensitive correlation between the neutron skin thickness and the
symmetry energy at supranormal density is established directly. Meanwhile, the
sensitivity of the neutron skin thickness to the low-density slope of the
symmetry energy is greatly increased in the corresponding kaonic nuclei. These
sensitive relationships are established upon the fact that the isovector
potential in the central region of kaonic nuclei becomes very sensitive to the
variation of the symmetry energy. These findings might provide another
perspective to constrain high-density symmetry energy, and await experimental
verification in the future.

with the rapid development of Deep Learning technologies. However, human facial
information is easy to be captured and reproduced, which makes face
authentication systems vulnerable to various attacks. Liveness detection is an
important defense technique to prevent such attacks, but existing solutions did
not provide clear and strong security guarantees, especially in terms of time.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose a new liveness detection protocol
called Face Flashing that significantly increases the bar for launching
successful attacks on face authentication systems. By randomly flashing
well-designed pictures on a screen and analyzing the reflected light, our
protocol has leveraged physical characteristics of human faces: reflection
processing at the speed of light, unique textual features, and uneven 3D
shapes. Cooperating with working mechanism of the screen and digital cameras,
our protocol is able to detect subtle traces left by an attacking process.
  To demonstrate the effectiveness of Face Flashing, we implemented a prototype
and performed thorough evaluations with large data set collected from
real-world scenarios. The results show that our Timing Verification can
effectively detect the time gap between legitimate authentications and
malicious cases. Our Face Verification can also differentiate 2D plane from 3D
objects accurately. The overall accuracy of our liveness detection system is

  Distributions","26 pages, 3 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sliced inverse regression (SIR) is the most widely-used sufficient dimension
reduction method due to its simplicity, generality and computational
efficiency. However, when the distribution of the covariates deviates from the
multivariate normal distribution, the estimation efficiency of SIR is rather
low. In this paper, we propose a robust alternative to SIR - called elliptical
sliced inverse regression (ESIR) for analysing high dimensional, elliptically
distributed data. There are wide range of applications of the elliptically
distributed data, especially in finance and economics where the distribution of
the data is often heavy-tailed. To tackle the heavy-tailed elliptically
distributed covariates, we novelly utilize the multivariate Kendall's tau
matrix in a framework of so-called generalized eigenvector problem for
sufficient dimension reduction. Methodologically, we present a practical
algorithm for our method. Theoretically, we investigate the asymptotic behavior
of the ESIR estimator and obtain the corresponding convergence rate under high
dimensional setting. Quantities of simulation results show that ESIR
significantly improves the estimation efficiency in heavy-tailed scenarios. A
stock exchange data analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.
Moreover, ESIR can be easily extended to most other sufficient dimension
reduction methods.

Here, we demonstrate numerically and experimentally a silicon metasurface at
THz frequencies that converts a Gaussian beam into a Vortex beam independent of
the polarization of the incident beam. The metasurface consists of an array of
sub-wavelength silicon cross resonators made of a high refractive index
material on substrates such as sapphire and CaF$_2$ that are transparent at
IR-THz spectral range. With these substrates, it is possible to create phase
elements for a specific spectral range including at the molecular finger
printing around 10$~\mu$m as well as at longer THz wavelengths where secondary
molecular structures can be revealed. This device offers high transmittance and
a phase coverage of 0 to $2\pi$. The transmittance phase is tuned by varying
the dimensions of the meta-atoms. To demonstrate wavefront engineering, we used
a discretized spiraling phase profile to convert the incident Gaussian beam to
vortex beam. To realize this, we divided the metasurface surface into eight
angular sectors and chose eight different dimensions for the crosses providing
successive phase shifts spaced by $\pi/4$ radians for each of these sectors.
Photolithography and reactive ion etching (RIE) were used to fabricate these
silicon crosses as the dimensions of these cylinders range up to few hundreds
of micrometers. Large 1-cm-diameter optical elements were successfully

emit synchrotron hard X-rays in two magnetic white dwarfs (WDs), also known as
cataclysmic variables (CVs). In nova outbursts of WDs, multi-GeV gamma-rays
were detected inferring that protons are accelerated to 100 GeV or higher. In
recent optical surveys, the WD density is found to be higher near the Sun than
in the Galactic disk by a factor $\sim$2.5. The cosmic rays (CR) produced by
local CVs and novae will accumulate in the local bubble for $10^6$ - $10^7$
yrs. On these findings, we search for CRs from historic CVs and novae in the
observed CR spectra. We model the CR spectra at the heliopause as sums of
Galactic and local components based on observational data as much as possible.
The initial Galactic CR electron and proton spectra are deduced from the
gamma-ray emissivity, the local electron spectrum from the hard X-ray spectra
at the CVs, and the local proton spectrum inferred by gamma-ray spectrum at
novae. These spectral shapes are then expressed in a simple set of polynomial
functions of CR energy and regressively fitted until the high-energy ($>$100
GeV) CR spectra near Earth and the Voyager-1 spectra at the heliopause are
reproduced. We then extend the modeling to nuclear CR spectra and find that one
spectral shape fits all local nuclear CRs and the apparent hardening of the
nuclear CR spectra is caused by the roll-down of local nuclear spectra around
100 - 200 GeV. All local CR spectra populate in a limited energy band below 100
- 200 GeV and enhance gamma-ray emissivity below $\sim$10 GeV. Such an
enhancement is observed in the inner Galaxy, suggesting the CR fluxes from CVs

representation of signals in which a synthesis dictionary is used for a frame
and an analysis dictionary is used for a dual frame. We sought to formulate a
novel dual frame design in which the sparse vector obtained through the
decomposition of any signal is also the sparse solution representing signals
based on a reconstruction frame. Our findings demonstrate that this type of
dual frame cannot be constructed for over-complete frames, thereby precluding
the use of any linear analysis operator in driving the sparse synthesis
coefficient for signal representation. Nonetheless, the best approximation to
the sparse synthesis solution can be derived from the analysis coefficient
using the canonical dual frame. In this study, we developed a novel dictionary
learning algorithm (called Parseval K-SVD) to learn a tight-frame dictionary.
We then leveraged the analysis and synthesis perspectives of signal
representation with frames to derive optimization formulations for problems
pertaining to image recovery. Our preliminary, results demonstrate that the
images recovered using this approach are correlated to the frame bounds of
dictionaries, thereby demonstrating the importance of using different

odd-even staggering is shown in the fragments with small neutron excess

$I$. The values of $a_{p}/T$ for the fragments, with $I$ from 0 to 36, have

of a sentence can result in an inaccurate description. This paper introduces a
new problem, called Visual Text Correction (VTC), i.e., finding and replacing
an inaccurate word in the textual description of a video. We propose a deep
network that can simultaneously detect an inaccuracy in a sentence, and fix it
by replacing the inaccurate word(s). Our method leverages the semantic
interdependence of videos and words, as well as the short-term and long-term
relations of the words in a sentence. In our formulation, part of a visual

process. Furthermore, to train and evaluate our model, we propose an approach
to automatically construct a large dataset for VTC problem. Our experiments and
performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed method provides very good

that their relaxation time is on the order of 10$^{32}$ years at room

intriguing dynamics of the relaxation of a commercial Corning Gorilla Glass at
room temperature, over 1.5 years. Here, we report a novel atomistic simulation
method allowing us to directly access the long-term (years) dynamics of glass
relaxation at room temperature. Based on the simulation of a series of mixed
alkali silicate glasses, we demonstrate that room-temperature relaxation is a
direct consequence of the mixed alkali effect. Although both volume and energy
feature a stretched exponential relaxation, our results reveal a bifurcation of
the stretching exponents, with $\beta$ = 3/5 and 3/7 for energy and volume
relaxation, respectively. Relaxation is found to occur through the diffusion of
local stressed structural instabilities inside the atomic network, which anneal
each other when a compressed atomic unit meets one that is under tension. The
driving force for such diffusion-trap relaxation mechanism is found to be at a
maximum when the concentrations of each alkali atom equal each other, which
arises from a balance between the concentration of each alkali atom and the
magnitude of the local stress that they undergo.

because faces captured in unconstrained operational domain (OD) over multiple
video cameras have a different underlying data distribution compared to faces
captured under controlled conditions in the enrollment domain (ED) with a still
camera. This is particularly true when individuals are enrolled to the system
using a single reference still. To improve the robustness of these systems, it
is possible to augment the reference set by generating synthetic faces based on
the original still. However, without knowledge of the OD, many synthetic images
must be generated to account for all possible capture conditions. FR systems
may, therefore, require complex implementations and yield lower accuracy when
training on many less relevant images. This paper introduces an algorithm for
domain-specific face synthesis (DSFS) that exploits the representative
intra-class variation information available from the OD. Prior to operation, a
compact set of faces from unknown persons appearing in the OD is selected
through clustering in the captured condition space. The domain-specific
variations of these face images are projected onto the reference stills by
integrating an image-based face relighting technique inside the 3D
reconstruction framework. A compact set of synthetic faces is generated that
resemble individuals of interest under the capture conditions relevant to the
OD. In a particular implementation based on sparse representation
classification, the synthetic faces generated with the DSFS are employed to
form a cross-domain dictionary that account for structured sparsity.
Experimental results reveal that augmenting the reference gallery set of FR
systems using the proposed DSFS approach can provide a higher level of accuracy
compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with only a moderate increase in its
computational complexity.

light is collected by a photon-counting bucket (single-pixel) detector. The
transmission coefficients measured in this way are then used to reconstruct the
spatial distribution of the object's projected transmission. It is demonstrated
that the squared spatial resolution of such a setup is usually equal to the

patterns. If the noise in the measured transmission coefficients is dominated
by photon shot noise, then the ratio of the spatially-averaged squared mean
signal to the spatially-averaged noise variance in the ""flat"" distribution

significantly improve the users' quality of experience (QoE) in video
streaming. An intuitive approach to achieve it is to use Multi-path TCP
(MPTCP). However, the deployment of MPTCP, especially with link preference,
requires OS kernel update at both the client and server side, and a vast amount
of commercial content providers do not support MPTCP. Thus, in this paper, we
realize a multi-path video streaming algorithm in the application layer
instead, by considering Scalable Video Coding (SVC), where each layer of every
chunk can be fetched from only one of the orthogonal paths. We formulate the
quality decisions of video chunks subject to the available bandwidth of the
different paths, chunk deadlines, and link preferences as an optimization
problem. The objective is to to optimize a QoE metric that maintains a tradeoff
between maximizing the playback rate of every chunk and ensuring fairness among
chunks. The QoE is a weighted some of the following metrics: skip/stall
duration, average playback rate, and quality switching rate. However, the
weights are chosen such that pushing more chunks to the same quality level is
more preferable over any other choice. Even though the formulation is a
non-convex discrete optimization, we show that the problem can be solved
optimally with a polynomial complexity in some special cases. We further
propose an online algorithm where several challenges including bandwidth
prediction errors, are addressed. Extensive emulated experiments in a real

potential, can largely reduce the attractive contributions of scalar meson
field at high density without any influence on nuclear structure around normal
saturation density. In this work, the TM1 parameter set is chosen as the RMF
interaction, while the strengths of logarithmic interaction are constrained by
the properties of finite nuclei so that we can obtain a reasonable effective
nucleon-nucleon interaction. The hyperons, $\Lambda,~\Sigma$, and $\Xi$ are
also considered in neutron stars within this framework, whose coupling
constants with mesons are determined by the latest hyperon-nucleon and
$\Lambda$-$\Lambda$ potentials extracted from the experimental data of
hypernuclei. The maximum mass of neutron star can be larger than two solar mass
with these hyperons. Furthermore, the nucleon mass at high density will be
saturated due to this additional $\sigma$-cut potential, which is consistent
with the conclusions from the microscopic calculations such as,
Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory and quark mean-field model.

However, several recent papers have shown that the openness of such spectrum
can also lead to it becoming over congested when used by competing wireless
service providers (SPs). This in turn can result in the SPs making no profit
and may deter them from entering the market. However, this prior work assumes
that unlicensed access is a separate service from any service offered using
licensed spectrum. Here, we instead consider the more common case were service
providers bundle both licensed and unlicensed spectrum as a single service and
offer this with a single price. We analyze a model for such a market and show
that in this case SPs are able to gain higher profit than the case without
bundling. It is also possible to get higher social welfare with bundling.
Moreover, we explore the case where SPs are allowed to manage the customers'

core-mantle boundary (CMB) and its incorporation into the mantle by buoyant
rise. Today, if SiO$_2$ is 100-10000 times more viscous than lower mantle
material, the dimensions of SiO$_2$ diapirs formed by the viscous
Rayleigh-Taylor instability at the CMB would cause them to be swept into the
mantle as inclusions of 100 m - 10 km diameter. Under early Earth conditions of
rapid heat loss after core formation, SiO$_2$ diapirs of ~1 km diameter could
have risen independently of mantle flow to their level of neutral buoyancy in
the mantle, trapping them there due to a combination of intrinsically high
viscosity and neutral buoyancy. We examine the SiO$_2$ yield by assuming Si+O
saturation at the conditions found at the base of a magma ocean and find that
for a range of conditions, dispersed bodies could reach as high as 8.5 vol.% in
parts of the lower mantle. At such low concentration, their effect on aggregate
seismic wavespeeds is within observational seismology uncertainty. However,
their presence can account for small-scale scattering in the lower mantle due
to the bodies' large velocity contrast. We conclude that the shallow lower

waves $\Omega_{gw}(f) = \Omega_{\alpha} (f/f_{ref})^{\alpha}$, the flat model
$\alpha = 0$ and the $\alpha = 2/3$ model, are studied. For a stochastic

stochastic search configurations are typically found when both the SRM
transmission and the SRC detuning phase are low. In this region, the BNS range
mostly lies between 160 and 180 Mpc. When a lower laser power is used (reducing
radiation pressure at low frequencies), the optimal SRC detuning phase
increases, the optimal SRM transmission increases and the optimal sensitivity
improves. A reduced low-frequency cutoff gives a better sensitivity limit. For
both models of $\Omega_{gw}$, a typical optimal sensitivity limit on the order

walk on a group (the Poisson--Furstenberg boundary); namely, the absolute of a
(semi)group is the set of ergodic central measures on the compactum of all
infinite trajectories of a simple random walk on the group. Related notions
have been discussed in the probability literature: Martin boundary, entrance
and exit boundaries (Dynkin), central measures on path spaces of graphs
(Vershik--Kerov). A central measure (with respect to a finite system of

distribution on the generators (i.e., a measure of maximal entropy). For a more
general notion of measures with a given cocycle. For the group~$\Bbb Z$, the
problem of describing the absolute is solved exactly by the classical
de~Finetti's theorem. The main result of this paper, which is a far-reaching

training data to learn a large number of parameters. However, training data is
not sufficient for visual object tracking as annotations of a target object are

to learn hierarchical features for visual object tracking by using tree
structure based Recursive Neural Networks (RNN), which have fewer parameters
than other deep neural networks, e.g. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
First, we learn RNN parameters to discriminate between the target object and
background in the first frame of a test sequence. Tree structure over local
patches of an exemplar region is randomly generated by using a bottom-up greedy
search strategy. Given the learned RNN parameters, we create two dictionaries
regarding target regions and corresponding local patches based on the learned
hierarchical features from both top and leaf nodes of multiple random trees. In
each of the subsequent frames, we conduct sparse dictionary coding on all
candidates to select the best candidate as the new target location. In
addition, we online update two dictionaries to handle appearance changes of
target objects. Experimental results demonstrate that our feature learning
algorithm can significantly improve tracking performance on benchmark datasets.

multiple scale transports. The modeling scale of the scheme is the mesh size
and time step, and the ratios of the mesh size over particle mean free path or
the time step over particle collision time determine the local evolution regime
of flow physics. For unsteady flow computation, due to the CFL condition the
time step in the explicit UGKS is limited by the smallest cell size in the
computational domain. As a result, for a largely stretched non-uniform mesh the
global time step becomes very small and the ratio of the time step over local
particle collision time may get a very small value. Under such a circumstance,
the physics in explicit UGKS may be constrained by the kinetic scale physics
only. The multiscale UGKS reduces into a single scale discrete velocity method
where the free transport is used for the flux evaluation. In order to keep the
advantages of UGKS and improve the efficiency for unsteady flow computation,
the restriction from global CFL condition on the time step has to be removed.
In this paper, we develop an implicit UGKS (IUGKS) for unsteady flow by
alternatively solving the macroscopic and microscopic governing equations
within a step iteratively. In order to preserve the coherent flow evolution and
multiscale nature, the numerical flux is still evaluated by the explicit UGKS
with the local CFL condition. Therefore, the multiscale property of the UGKS
modeling is preserved over non-uniform meshes. Many numerical examples are
included to validate the scheme for both continuum and rarefied flows. The
IUGKS presents reasonably good results with second order accuracy for unsteady
flow computation and the efficiency has been improved by dozen of times in
comparison with the explicit UGKS.

develop this design by examining and analyzing smart contracts from the

contracts can be delineated according to complexity: Smart contracts that can
be verified objectively without much uncertainty belong in an
inter-organizational context; those that cannot be objectively verified belong
in an intra-organizational context. We state that smart contracts that
implement a formal (e.g. mathematical or simulation) model are especially
beneficial for both contexts: They can be used to express and enforce
inter-organizational agreements, and their basis in a common formalism may
ensure effective evaluation and comparison between different
intra-organizational contracts. Finally, we present a case study of our

objects of interest (e.g., person and vehicles) in large scale home
surveillance videos. The traditional method usually consists of two separate
steps, i.e., detecting moving objects with background subtraction running on
the camera, and filtering out nuisance motion events (e.g., trees, cloud,
shadow, rain/snow, flag) with deep learning based object detection and tracking
running on cloud. The method is extremely slow and therefore not cost
effective, and does not fully leverage the spatial-temporal redundancies with a
pre-trained off-the-shelf object detector. To dramatically speedup relevant
motion event detection and improve its performance, we propose a novel network
for relevant motion event detection, ReMotENet, which is a unified, end-to-end
data-driven method using spatial-temporal attention-based 3D ConvNets to
jointly model the appearance and motion of objects-of-interest in a video.
ReMotENet parses an entire video clip in one forward pass of a neural network
to achieve significant speedup. Meanwhile, it exploits the properties of home
surveillance videos, e.g., relevant motion is sparse both spatially and
temporally, and enhances 3D ConvNets with a spatial-temporal attention model
and reference-frame subtraction to encourage the network to focus on the
relevant moving objects. Experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve
comparable or event better performance than the object detection based method
but with three to four orders of magnitude speedup (up to 20k times) on GPU
devices. Our network is efficient, compact and light-weight. It can detect
relevant motion on a 15s surveillance video clip within 4-8 milliseconds on a
GPU and a fraction of second (0.17-0.39) on a CPU with a model size of less
than 1MB.

as the end member alloys CuMnSb and CoMnSb are semi metallic (SM)
antiferromagnetic (AFM) and half metallic (HM) ferromagnetic (FM),
respectively. Clearly, Co-doping at the Cu-site of CuMnSb introduces changes in
the carrier concentration at the Fermi level that may lead to half-metallic
ground state but there remains a persistent controversy whether the AFM to FM
transition occurs simultaneously. Our experimental results reveal that the AFM
to FM magnetic transition occurs through a percolation mechanism where
Co-substitution gradually suppresses the AFM phase and forces FM polarization
around every dopant cobalt. As a result a mixed magnetic phase is realized
within this composition range while a nearly HM band structure is developed
already at the 10% Co-doping. Absence of T$^2$ dependence in the resistivity
variation at low T-region serves as an indirect proof of opening up an energy
gap at the Fermi surface in one of the spin channels. This is further
corroborated by the ab-initio electronic structure calculations that suggests a

generally, theory of randomized black-box optimization techniques is running
time analysis. Running time analysis aims at understanding the performance of a
given heuristic on a given problem by bounding the number of function
evaluations that are needed by the heuristic to identify a solution of a
desired quality. As in general algorithms theory, this running time perspective
is most useful when it is complemented by a meaningful complexity theory that
studies the limits of algorithmic solutions.
  In the context of discrete black-box optimization, several black-box
complexity models have been developed to analyze the best possible performance
that a black-box optimization algorithm can achieve on a given problem. The
models differ in the classes of algorithms to which these lower bounds apply.
This way, black-box complexity contributes to a better understanding of how
certain algorithmic choices (such as the amount of memory used by a heuristic,
its selective pressure, or properties of the strategies that it uses to create
new solution candidates) influences performance.
  In this chapter we review the different black-box complexity models that have
been proposed in the literature, survey the bounds that have been obtained for
these models, and discuss how the interplay of running time analysis and
black-box complexity can inspire new algorithmic solutions to well-researched
problems in evolutionary computation. We also discuss in this chapter several

We first prove the existence of an optimal control for a given tracking type

first-order necessary optimality conditions. These results generalize the ones

tracking requires position modulation of only 10 nm, which allows simultaneous

purely mechanical strategy to achieve expected returns of 10\% to 25\% in an
equiprobable lottery with no take and no carryover pool. We prove that an
optimal strategy (Nash equilibrium) in a game between the syndicate and other
players consists of betting one of each ticket (the ""trump ticket""), and extend
that result to proportional ticket selection in non-equiprobable lotteries. The
strategy can be adjusted to accommodate lottery taxes and carryover pools. No
""irrationality"" need be involved for the strategy to succeed --- it requires
only that a large group of non-syndicate bettors each choose a few tickets
independently.

few government sponsored lotteries that has the potential for a favorable
strategy we call ""buying the pot."" By buying the pot we mean that a syndicate
buys each ticket in the lottery, ensuring that it holds a jackpot winner. We
assume that the other bettors independently buy small numbers of tickets. This
paper presents (1) a formula for the syndicate's expected return, (2)
conditions under which buying the pot produces a significant positive expected
return, and (3) the implications of these findings for lottery design.

speed of light in an attempt to enhance the standard description of special
relativity. First, we demonstrate that it is possible to introduce a quaternion
time domain where a coordinate point is described by a quaternion time. We show
that the time measurement is a function of the observer location, even for
stationary frames of reference. We introduce a moving observer, which leads to
the traditional Lorentz relation for the time interval. We show that the
present approach can be used in stationary, moving, or rotating frames of
reference, unlike the traditional special relativity, which applies only to the
inertial moving frames. Then, we use the quaternion formulation of space-time
and mass-energy equivalence to extend the quaternion relativity to space, mass,
and energy. We demonstrate that the transition between the particle and
observer reference frames is equivalent to space inversion and can be described
mathematically by quaternion conjugation. On the other hand, physical
measurements are described by the quaternion norm and consequently are
independent of the conjugation, which seems to be the quaternion formulation of
the relativity principle.

  Wireless Networks","Full version (accepted by INFOCOM 2018)",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Driven by mission-critical applications in modern industrial systems, the 5th
generation (5G) communication system is expected to provide ultra-reliable
low-latency communications (URLLC) services to meet the quality of service
(QoS) demands of industrial applications. However, these stringent requirements
cannot be guaranteed by its conventional dynamic access scheme due to the
complex signaling procedure. A promising solution to reduce the access delay is
the pre-allocation scheme based on the semi-persistent scheduling (SPS)
technique, which however may lead to low spectrum utilization if the allocated
resource blocks (RBs) are not used. In this paper, we aim to address this issue
by developing DPre, a predictive pre-allocation framework for uplink access
scheduling of delay-sensitive applications in industrial process automation.
The basic idea of DPre is to explore and exploit the correlation of data
acquisition and access behavior between nodes through static and dynamic
learning mechanisms in order to make judicious resource per-allocation
decisions. We evaluate the effectiveness of DPre based on several monitoring
applications in a steel rolling production process. Simulation results
demonstrate that DPre achieves better performance in terms of the prediction
accuracy, which can effectively increase the rewards of those reserved
resources.

performed in a twofold way. In the first case the ordinary two-dimensional
electromagnetism is obtained with sources in the form of conserved electric
currents flowing along the surface. The electric field is a two-vector tangent
to the surface and magnetic field is a scalar quantity. In the second approach
the reduced theory is that of the two-vector magnetic field and a scalar
electric one. The only source coupled to the fields is now a scalar subject to
no conservation law. In the redefined theory this scalar source is may be
converted into an eddy magnetic current flowing in the surface. No magnetic
monopoles appear. Our results can find some applications in the electrodynamics
of thin layers and of metal-dielectric interfaces.

  N-Doped Carbon Nanotube Arrays in Rechargeable Zinc-Air Battery","49 pages, 7 figures",,,,"physics.app-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in Zn-air
batteries (ZABs) require highly efficient, cost-effective and stable
electrocatalysts as replacements to traditionally high cost, inconsistently
stable and low poison resistant Platinum group metals (PGM) catalysts.
Although, nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (NCNT) arrays have been developed over
recent decades through various advanced technologies are now capable of
catalyzing ORR efficiently, their underdeveloped bifunctional property,
hydrophobic surface, and detrimental preparation strategy are found to limit
practical large-scale commercialization for effective rechargeable ZABs. Here,
we have demonstrated fabrication of a three-dimensional (3D) nickel foam
supported NCNT arrays with CoNi nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated within the
apical domain (denoted as CoNi@NCNT/NF) that exhibits excellent bifunctional
catalytic performance toward both ORR (onset potential of 0.97 V vs. RHE) and
OER (overpotential of 1.54 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm$^{-2}$). We further examined
the practicability of this CoNi@NCNT/NF material being used as an air electrode
for rechargeable ZAB coin cell and pouch cell systems. The ZAB coin cell showed
a peak power density of 108 mW cm$^{-2}$ with an energy density of 845 Wh
kg$_{Zn}^{-1}$ and robust rechargeability over 28h under ambient conditions,
which exceeds the performance of PGM catalysts and leading non-PGM
electrocatalysts. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations
revealed that the ORR and OER catalytic performance of the CoNi@NCNT/NF
electrode are mainly derived from the d-orbitals from the CoNi NPs encapsulated
within the apical dominant end of the NCNTs.

mode. The name of the mode varies from browser to browser but the purpose of
the private mode remains same in every browser. In normal browsing mode, the
browser keeps track of users' activity and related data such as browsing
histories, cookies, auto-filled fields, temporary internet files, etc. In
private mode, it is said that no information is stored while browsing or all
information is destroyed after closing the current private session. However,
some researchers have already disproved this claim by performing various tests
in most popular browsers. I have also some personal experience where private
mode browsing fails to keep all browsing information as private. In this
position paper, I take the position against private browsing. By examining
various facts, it is proved that the private browsing mode is not really
private as it is claimed; it does not keep everything private. In following
sections, I will present the proof to justify my argument. Along with some
other already performed research work, I will show my personal case studies and
experimental data as well.
