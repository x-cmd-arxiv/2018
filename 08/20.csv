parametric likelihood functions in the construction of Bayesian-type procedures
has been well-addressed in the modern statistical literature. We rigorously
derive the EL prior, a Jeffreys-type prior, which asymptotically maximizes the
Shannon mutual information between data and the parameters of interest. The
focus of our approach is on an integrated Kullback-Leibler distance between the
EL-based posterior and prior density functions. The EL prior density is the
density function for which the corresponding posterior form is asymptotically
negligibly different from the EL. We show that the proposed result can be used
to develop a methodology for reducing the asymptotic bias of solutions of
general estimating equations and M-estimation schemes by removing the
first-order term. This technique is developed in a similar manner to methods
employed to reduce the asymptotic bias of maximum likelihood estimates via
penalizing the underlying parametric likelihoods by their Jeffreys invariant
priors. A real data example related to a study of myocardial infarction
illustrates the attractiveness of the proposed technique in practical aspects.

bands, mainly due to the availability of large unused spectrum. However, due to
high path loss at mmWave frequencies, coverage of mmWave signals can get
severely reduced, especially for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. In this
work, we study the use of passive metallic reflectors of different shapes/sizes
to improve mmWave signal coverage for indoor NLOS scenarios. Software defined
radio based mmWave transceiver platforms operating at 28 GHz are used for
indoor measurements. Subsequently, ray tracing (RT) simulations are carried out
in a similar environment using Remcom Wireless InSite software. The cumulative
distribution functions of the received signal strength for the RT simulations
in the area of interest are observed to be reasonably close with those obtained
from the measurements. Our measurements and RT simulations both show that there
is significant (on the order of 20 dB) power gain obtained with square metallic
reflectors, when compared to no reflector scenario for an indoor corridor. We
also observe that overall mmWave signal coverage can be improved utilizing
reflectors of different shapes and orientations.

$d_{xy}$ fermion is much heavier than that of $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ fermions. We
argue that the heavy $d_{xy}$ band contributes most to the specific heat in the
normal state, but the superconducting gap on the $d_{xy}$ pocket is
parametrically smaller than that on $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ pockets. We argue that in
this situation the jump of $C(T)$ at $T_c$ is determined by $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$
fermions, and the ratio $(C_s-C_n)/C_n$ is a fraction of that in a one-band BCS
theory. Below $T_c$, $C(T)$ remains relatively flat down to some $T^*$, below
which $C(T)$ rapidly drops. This behavior is consistent with the data for
KFe$_2$As$_2$ and related materials. We argue that the data on $C(T)$ can be
reproduced without assuming that the quasiparticle residue $Z$ on $d_{xy}$ band

the jumping parameters and the input delay are considered simultaneously, which
forms the basic difficulty of the design. one of the key techniques is to solve
a delayed forward and backward jumping parameter difference equation which is
obtained by an improved maximum principle, and the other is the introduction of
a ""d-step backward formula"". Based on the proposed techniques, a necessary and
sufficient condition for the existence of the optimal controller is given in an
explicit form and an analytical solution to the optimal controller is supplied.
The optimal controller is a linear function of the current time state and the
historical time control input, where the feedback gains are a set of jumping
parameter matrices derived by solving a new type of coupled difference Riccati
equation. The key step in the derivation is to establish the relationship
between the costate and the real state of the system. The result obtained in
this paper can be viewed as a generalization of the standard case, in which
there is only one mode of operation.

as acceptor, a comparison was made between the nonencapsulated devices upon
exposure to dry air, dry air with illumination and humid air. The impact on the
active layer's photophysics is discussed, along with the device physics in
terms of integral solar cell performance and spatially resolved photocurrent
distribution with point-to-point analysis of the diode characteristics to
determine the origin of the observed behavior. The results show that even
without the widely used hygroscopic HT layer, PEDOT:PSS, humidity is still a
major factor in the short-term environmental degradation of organic solar cells
with this architecture, and not only oxygen or light, as is often reported.
Different from previous reports where water-induced device degradation was
spatially homogeneous and formation of Al2O3 islands was only seen for oxygen
permeation through pinholes in aluminum, we observed insulating islands merely
after humidity exposure in the present study. Further, we demonstrated with
laser beam induced current mapping and point-to-point diode analysis that the
water-induced performance losses are a result of the exposed device area
comprising regions with entirely unaltered high output and intact diode
behavior and those with severe degradation showing detrimentally lowered output
and voltage-independent charge blocking, which is essentially insulating
behavior. It is suggested that this is caused by transport of water through
pinholes to the organic/metal interface, where they form insulating oxide or
hydroxide islands, while the organic active layer stays unharmed.

nonlinear wave triads have been traditionally derived in the absence of any
background velocity. In this paper, we have studied how these resonance
conditions get modified when uniform, as well as various piecewise linear
velocity profiles, are considered for two-layered shear flows. Background
velocity can influence the resonance conditions in two ways (i) by causing
Doppler shifts, and (ii) by changing the intrinsic frequencies of the waves.
For Bragg resonance, even a uniform velocity field changes the resonance
condition. Velocity shear strongly influences the resonance conditions since,
in addition to changing the intrinsic frequencies, it can cause unequal Doppler
shifts between the surface, pycnocline, and the bottom. Using multiple scale
analysis and Fredholm alternative, we analytically obtain the equations
governing both the Bragg resonance and the wave triads. We have also extended
the Higher Order Spectral method, a highly efficient computational tool usually
used to study triad and Bragg resonance problems, to incorporate the effect of
piecewise linear velocity profile. A significant aspect, both in theoretical
and numerical fronts, has been extending the potential flow approximation,

high Q factor. The light is localized near the interface and the field
decreases exponentially with the distance from the interface. The penetration
of the field into the chiral medium is virtually blocked at wavelengths
corresponding to the photonic band gap and close to the pitch of the helix. The
polarization-preserving mirror has another photonic band gap as well. Our
analytics agrees well with precise calculations, enabling intelligent design
for laser and sensing applications.

the first step towards the ultimate goal of building a universal dialog system,
we set out to build a cross-lingual state tracking framework. Specifically, we
assume that there exists a source language with dialog belief tracking
annotations while the target languages have no annotated dialog data of any
form. Then, we pre-train a state tracker for the source language as a teacher,
which is able to exploit easy-to-access parallel data. We then distill and
transfer its own knowledge to the student state tracker in target languages. We
specifically discuss two types of common parallel resources: bilingual corpus

accordingly. Experimentally, we successfully use English state tracker as the
teacher to transfer its knowledge to both Italian and German trackers and
achieve promising results.

obtained in numerical simulations with a stochastic discrete element method.
Results are obtained with two criteria which are consistent with the theory of
elasticity and compared with previous results using the original criterion,
chosen when the method was first published, The conventional choice has been to
consider the combined loading as an interaction between bending and tensile
forces only, leaving out shear forces altogether. Moreover the combination of
bending and tension used in the old criterion is correct only for plastic
deformations. Our results show that the inclusion of shear forces have a
profound effect on crack morphology. We consider two types of external loading,
torsion applied to a circular cylinder and tension applied to a cube. In the
tensile case, the exponent which characterises scaling of crack roughness with
system size is found to be very close to the experimental value zeta = 0:5 when
realistic fracture criteria are used. In the present calculations we obtain
zeta = 0.52, a value which remains constant for all disorders. It is proposed
that the small-scale exponent zeta = 0.8 appears as a consequence of cleavage
between crystal planes and consequently requires a different fracture criterion
than that which is used on larger scales.

existing countermeasures either fail to provide protection guarantees or are
not easily deployable. Blockchain systems are particularly vulnerable to such
attacks as they rely on Internet-wide communication to reach consensus. In
particular, Bitcoin -the most widely-used cryptocurrency- can be split in half
by any AS-level adversary using BGP hijacking. In this paper, we present SABRE,
a secure and scalable Bitcoin relay network which relays blocks worldwide
through a set of connections that are resilient to routing attacks. SABRE runs
alongside the existing peer-to-peer network and is easily deployable. As a
critical system, SABRE design is highly resilient and can efficiently handle
high bandwidth loads, including Denial of Service attacks. We built SABRE
around two key technical insights. First, we leverage fundamental properties of
inter-domain routing (BGP) policies to host relay nodes: (i) in locations that
are inherently protected against routing attacks; and (ii) on paths that are
economically preferred by the majority of Bitcoin clients. These properties are
generic and can be used to protect other Blockchain-based systems. Second, we
leverage the fact that relaying blocks is communication-heavy, not
computation-heavy. This enables us to offload most of the relay operations to
programmable network hardware (using the P4 programming language). Thanks to
this hardware/software co-design, SABRE nodes operate seamlessly under high
load while mitigating the effects of malicious clients. We present a complete
implementation of SABRE together with an extensive evaluation. Our results
demonstrate that SABRE is effective at securing Bitcoin against routing
attacks, even with deployments as small as 6 nodes.

to a range of formation scenarios from 'cold' to 'hot' start models. For a
planet of a given mass, these initial conditions govern its subsequent
evolution in luminosity and radius. Except for upper limits from radial
velocity studies, disk modelling, and dynamical instability arguments, no mass
measurements of young planets are yet available to distinguish between these
different models. Here we report on the detection of the astrometric motion of
Beta Pictoris, the 21 Myr-old host star of an archetypical directly-imaged gas

accurate Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion from the internal 3-yr Hipparcos

model-independent planet mass of M=11+-2 MJup. This is consistent with
scenarios in which the planet is formed in a high-entropy state as assumed by
hot start models. The ongoing data collection by Gaia will in the near future
lead to mass measurements of other young gas giants and form a great asset to

emission is resolved into point sources, the properties of the WHIM along the
line of sight are recorded in the absorption lines in the stacked spectrum of
resolved sources and in the emission lines in the remaining diffuse signal. For
the strongest resonant lines, this implies a factor of $\sim30$ boost in
emissivity compared to the intrinsic emissivity over the major part of the
density-temperature parameter space region relevant for WHIM. The overall boost
for the 0.5-1 keV band is $\sim4$, declining steeply at temperatures above

boost, contribution of the resonant scattering changes relative intensities of

behavior of the Dirac Fermions, including the propagation of the charge density
which exhibits the causality, affects largely the low-temperature physical
properties of the Dirac semimetal, like the silicene. For the
polarization-related quantities (like the dielectric function), the method of
standard random phase approximation (RPA) provides the non-interaction results
(ignore the many electron effect), for a more exact result, we discuss the
self-energy and the vertex correction for the two-dimension Dirac model. We
found that, after the self-energy correction, the longitudinal conductivity
increase compared to the noninteracting one in optical limit. For the
renormalization treatment, the ultraviolet cutoff is setted as $\Lambda=t$ in
our calculations, i.e., within the range between two Van Hove singularities
where the density of states divergent logarithmically. %The $\Lambda$ is indeed
a non-universal parameter and can also be choiced larger than arbitary ${\bf

equals deterministic logspace (L). To show that RL=L, it suffices to construct
explicit pseudorandom generators (PRGs) that fool polynomial-size read-once
(oblivious) branching programs (roBPs). Starting with the work of Nisan,
pseudorandom generators with seed-length $O(\log^2 n)$ were constructed.
Unfortunately, improving on this seed-length in general has proven challenging
and seems to require new ideas.
  A recent line of inquiry has suggested focusing on a particular limitation of
the existing PRGs, which is that they only fool roBPs when the variables are
read in a particular known order, such as $x_1<\cdots<x_n$. In comparison,
existentially one can obtain logarithmic seed-length for fooling the set of
polynomial-size roBPs that read the variables under any fixed unknown
permutation $x_{\pi(1)}<\cdots<x_{\pi(n)}$. While recent works have established
novel PRGs in this setting for subclasses of roBPs, there were no known
$n^{o(1)}$ seed-length explicit PRGs for general polynomial-size roBPs in this
setting.
  In this work, we follow the ""bounded independence plus noise"" paradigm of
Haramaty, Lee and Viola, and give an improved analysis in the general roBP
unknown-order setting. With this analysis we obtain an explicit PRG with
seed-length $O(\log^3 n)$ for polynomial-size roBPs reading their bits in an
unknown order. Plugging in a recent Fourier tail bound of Chattopadhyay,
Hatami, Reingold, and Tal, we can obtain a $\widetilde{O}(\log^2 n)$
seed-length when the roBP is of constant width.

a state of continual reconfiguration via dissipative, avalanche-like slip
events that relieve built-up local stress. However, how the statistics of such
events depend on local interactions among the constituent units remains
debated. To address this we perform experiments on granular material in which
we use particle shape to vary the interactions systematically. Granular
material, confined under constant pressure boundary conditions, is uniaxially
compressed while stress is measured and internal rearrangements are imaged with
x-rays. We introduce volatility, a quantity from economic theory, as a powerful
new tool to quantify the magnitude of stress fluctuations, finding systematic,
shape-dependent trends. For all 22 investigated shapes the magnitude $s$ of
relaxation events is well-fit by a truncated power law distribution $P(s)\sim
{s}^{-\tau} exp(-s/s^*)$, as has been proposed within the context of plasticity
models. The power law exponent $\tau$ for all shapes tested clusters around
$\tau=$ 1.5, within experimental uncertainty covering the range 1.3 - 1.7. The
shape independence of $\tau$ and its compatibility with mean field models
indicate that the granularity of the system, but not particle shape, modifies
the stress redistribution after a slip event away from that of continuum
elasticity. Meanwhile, the characteristic maximum event size $s^*$ changes by
two orders of magnitude and tracks the shape dependence of volatility. Particle
shape in granular materials is therefore a powerful new factor influencing the
distance at which an amorphous system operates from scale-free criticality.
These experimental results are not captured by current models and suggest a
need to reexamine the mechanisms driving mesoscale plastic deformation in
amorphous systems.

assessment of residual strain and stress within experimental mechanics. These
methods typically measure a component of the average strain within a gauge
volume. It is common place to treat these measurements as point measurements
and to interpolate and extrapolate their values over the region of interest.
Such interpolations are not guaranteed to satisfy the physical properties of
equilibrium and applied loading conditions. In this paper, we provide a
numerically robust algorithm for inferring two dimensional, biaxial strain
fields over a region of interest from diffraction-based measurements that
satisfies equilibrium and any known loading conditions. By correctly treating
the measurements as gauge volume averages rather than point-wise the algorithm
has better performance when large gauge volumes and subsequently shorter
beam-times are used. This algorithm is demonstrated on simulation and

of a model glass subjected to thermal cycling are investigated using molecular
dynamics simulations. We study a non-additive binary mixture which is annealed
with different cooling rates from the liquid phase to a low temperature well
below the glass transition. The thermal treatment is applied by repeatedly
heating and cooling the system at constant pressure, thus temporarily inducing
internal stresses upon thermal expansion. We find that poorly annealed glasses
are relocated to progressively lower levels of potential energy over
consecutive cycles, whereas well annealed glasses can be rejuvenated at
sufficiently large amplitudes of thermal cycling. Moreover, the lowest levels
of potential energy after one hundred cycles are detected at a certain
temperature amplitude for all cooling rates. The structural transition to
different energy states is accompanied by collective nonaffine displacements of
atoms that are organized into clusters, whose typical size becomes larger with
increasing cooling rate or temperature amplitude. We show that the elastic
modulus and the peak value of the stress overshoot exhibit distinct maxima at
the cycling amplitude, which corresponds to the minimum of the potential
energy. The simulation results indicate that the yielding peak as a function of
the cycling amplitude for quickly annealed glasses represents a lower bound for
the maximum stress in glasses prepared with lower cooling rates.

second neighborhood is at least as large as its first. In this note, we put
forward a conjecture that we prove is actually equivalent: every oriented
simple graph contains a subset of vertices $S$ whose second neighborhood is at
least as large as its first.
  This subset perspective gives some insight into the original conjecture. For
example, if there is a counterexample to the second neighborhood conjecture
with minimum degree $\delta$, then there exists a counterexample on at most
${\delta + 1 \choose 2}$ vertices.
  Given a vertex $v$, let $d_1^+(v)$ and $d_2^+(v)$ be the size of its first
and second neighborhoods respectively. A digraph is $m$-free if there is no
directed cycle on $m$ or fewer vertices. Let $\lambda_m$ be the largest value

\lambda_m d_1^+(v)$. The second neighborhood conjecture implies $\lambda_m = 1$

that the total force consists of the driving-field force, the

in a guided mode, the Rabi frequency and, hence, the magnitude of the force of
the guided driving field may depend on the propagation direction. When the
atomic dipole rotates in the meridional plane, the spontaneous-emission recoil
force may arise as a result of the asymmetric spontaneous emission with respect
to opposite propagation directions. The van der Waals potential for the atom in
the ground state is off-resonant and opposite to the off-resonant part of the
van der Waals potential for the atom in the excited state. Unlike the potential
for the ground state, the potential for the excited state may oscillate
depending on the distance from the atom to the fiber surface.

stochastic momentum methods, AdaGrad) are the choice of algorithms for solving
non-convex problems (especially deep learning), there still remain big gaps
between the theory and the practice with many questions unresolved. For
example, there is still a lack of theories of convergence for SGD and its
variants that use stagewise step size and return an averaged solution in
practice. In addition, theoretical insights of why adaptive step size of
AdaGrad could improve non-adaptive step size of {\sgd} is still missing for
non-convex optimization. This paper aims to address these questions and fill
the gap between theory and practice. We propose a universal stagewise
optimization framework for a broad family of {\bf non-smooth non-convex}
(namely weakly convex) problems with the following key features: (i) at each
stage any suitable stochastic convex optimization algorithms (e.g., SGD or
AdaGrad) that return an averaged solution can be employed for minimizing a
regularized convex problem; (ii) the step size is decreased in a stagewise
manner; (iii) an averaged solution is returned as the final solution that is
selected from all stagewise averaged solutions with sampling probabilities {\it
increasing} as the stage number. Our theoretical results of stagewise AdaGrad
exhibit its adaptive convergence, therefore shed insights on its faster
convergence for problems with sparse stochastic gradients than stagewise SGD.
To the best of our knowledge, these new results are the first of their kind for
addressing the unresolved issues of existing theories mentioned earlier.
Besides theoretical contributions, our empirical studies show that our
stagewise SGD and ADAGRAD improve the generalization performance of existing
variants/implementations of SGD and ADAGRAD.

performance on many natural language processing (NLP) applications, the

context-based samples are used in the training. For further performance
improvement, two new post-processing techniques, called post-processing via
variance normalization (PVN) and post-processing via dynamic embedding (PDE),
are proposed in this work. The PVN method normalizes the variance of principal
components of word vectors while the PDE method learns orthogonal latent
variables from ordered input sequences. The PVN and the PDE methods can be
integrated to achieve better performance. We apply these post-processing
techniques to two popular word embedding methods (i.e., word2vec and GloVe) to
yield their post-processed representations. Extensive experiments are conducted
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed post-processing techniques.

differential equations (SDEs). A robust numerical integrator based on a
splitting method was proposed to solve the SDEs and a rigorous error analysis
for the numerical integrator was provided using the backward error analysis

analysis for the numerical integrator that allows us to get rid of the
exponential growth factor in our previous error estimate. Our new error
analysis is based on a probabilistic approach, which interprets the solution
process generated by our numerical integrator as a Markov process. By exploring
the ergodicity of the solution process, we prove the convergence analysis of
our method in computing effective diffusivity over infinite time. We present
numerical results to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method

which is inconsistent with the trend that HV SNe Ia generally have larger
velocity gradients. We find that the HV SNe Ia with LVGs tend to have
relatively stronger Si III (at ~4400 Angstrom) absorptions in early spectra,
larger ratios of S II 5468 to S II 5640, and weaker Si II 5972 absorptions
compared to their counterparts with similar velocities but high velocity
gradients. This shows that the HV+LVG subgroup of SNe Ia may have intrinsically
higher photospheric temperature, which indicates that their progenitors may
experience more complete burning in the explosions relative to the typical HV
SNe Ia.

no approach to efficiently detecting directly from observational data context

  We show that any deterministic, unanimous, group-strategyproof mechanism must

conjecture the observed effect to be due to the effective external quenched

orbiting a slightly evolved F7V main sequence star.
  In contrast to previous claims in the literature, we confirm that the system
does not belong to the galactic open cluster Ruprecht 147. We determine its
fundamental parameters combining K2 time-series data with spectroscopic
observations from the McDonald Observatory, FIES@NOT, and HIRES@KECK. The very
precise photometric data from the K2 mission allows us to measure variations
caused by the beaming effect (relativistic doppler boosting), ellipsoidal
variation, reflection, and the secondary eclipse. We determined the radial
velocity using spectroscopic observations and compare it to the radial velocity
determined from the beaming effect observed in the photometric data. The M5V
star has a radius of $0.200 \substack{+0.007 \\ -0.008}$ $R_{\odot}$ and a mass
of $0.187 \substack{+0.012 \\ -0.013}$ $M_{\odot}$. The primary star has radius
of $1.518 \substack{+0.038 \\ -0.049}$ $R_{\odot}$ and a mass of $1.008
\substack{+0.081 \\ -0.097}$ $M_{\odot}$. The orbital period is $ 5.441995 \pm
0.000007$ days. The system is one of the few eclipsing systems with observed
beaming effect and spectroscopic radial velocity measurements and it can be
used as test case for the modelling of the beaming effect.
  Current and forthcoming space missions such as TESS and PLATO might benefit
of the analysis of the beaming effect to estimate the mass of transiting
companions without the need for radial velocity follow up observations,
provided that the systematic sources of noise affecting this method are well
understood.

superconductors. However, the connection between the model and the experimental
phase diagram is still under debate, in particular regarding the existence and
extent of the $d$-wave superconducting phase. Recent rapid progress in
improving the accuracy of numerical solvers has opened a way to answer this
question reliably. Here, we study the hole-doping concentration ($\delta$)
dependence of the Hubbard model in the ground states on a square lattice at
strong coupling $U/t=10$, for the on-site interaction $U$ and the transfer $t$,
using a variational Monte Carlo method. The method, which combines tensor
network and Lanczos methods on top of Pfaffian wave functions, reveals a rich
phase diagram, in which many orders compete severely and degenerate within the
energy range of 0.01$t$. We have identified distinct phases including a uniform
$d$-wave superconducting phase for $0.17\lesssim \delta \lesssim0.22$ and a
stripe charge/spin ordered phase for $\delta\lesssim0.17$ with the stripe
period depending on $\delta$, together with presumable spatially coexisting
antiferromagnetic and stripe order for $\delta\lesssim0.07$ and coexisting
stripe and $d$-wave superconductivity for $0.07\lesssim\delta\lesssim0.17$. The
present, improved method revealed a wider region of a charge uniform
superconducting phase than the previous studies and shows a qualitative
similarity to the phase diagram of the cuprate superconductors. The
superconducting order parameter is largest at doping of around $\delta=0.17$ in
the ground state, which undergoes phase transitions from an inhomogeneous to a
uniform state.

squares minimization combined with a (convex) structural constraint. While
Lasso-type estimators were originally designed for noisy linear regression
problems, it has recently turned out that they are in fact robust against
various types of model uncertainties and misspecifications, most notably,
non-linearly distorted observation models. This work provides more theoretical
evidence for this somewhat astonishing phenomenon. At the heart of our analysis
stands the mismatch principle, which is a simple recipe to establish
theoretical error bounds for the generalized Lasso. The associated estimation
guarantees are of independent interest and are formulated in a fairly general
setup, permitting arbitrary sub-Gaussian data, possibly with strongly
correlated feature designs; in particular, we do not assume a specific
observation model which connects the input and output variables. Although the
mismatch principle is conceived based on ideas from statistical learning
theory, its actual application area are (high-dimensional) estimation tasks for
semi-parametric models. In this context, the benefits of the mismatch principle
are demonstrated for a variety of popular problem classes, such as single-index
models, generalized linear models, and variable selection. Apart from that, our
findings are also relevant to recent advances in quantized and distributed
compressed sensing.

$db_1^{\alpha_1}b_2^{\alpha_2} \cdots b_r^{\alpha_r}$, where the $\alpha_j$ are
nonnegative integers and the digits $d$ are taken from a fixed finite set. We
consider multi-base representations with at least two bases that are
multiplicatively independent. Our main result states that the order of
magnitude of the minimal Hamming weight of an integer~$n$, i.e., the minimal
number of nonzero summands in a representation of~$n$, is $\log n / (\log \log
n)$. This is independent of the number of bases, the bases themselves, and the
digit set.
  For the proof, the existing upper bound for prime bases is generalized to
multiplicatively independent bases, for the required analysis of the natural
greedy algorithm, an auxiliary result in Diophantine approximation is derived.
The lower bound follows by a counting argument and alternatively by using
communication complexity, thereby improving the existing bounds and closing the
gap in the order of magnitude. This implies also that the greedy algorithm
terminates after $\mathcal{O}(\log n/\log \log n)$ steps, and that this bound
is sharp.

seamless manner to utilize both CPU and GPU resources in the cloud has become a
bottleneck for rapid application development. To support this application
demand for simultaneous heterogeneous resource usage, programming models and
new frameworks are needed to manage the underlying resources effectively. Aneka
is emerged as a popular PaaS computing model for the development of Cloud

in a single container .NET platform. Since, Aneka addresses MIMD application
development that uses CPU based resources and GPU programming like CUDA is
designed for SIMD application development, here, the chapter discusses GPU PaaS

.NET platforms. The popular opensource GPU libraries are utilized and
integrated it into the existing Aneka task programming model. The scheduling

selected from 23 SNe Ia with extremely early-phase optical light curves
(""golden"" early-phase SNe Ia), and three of them are selected from 40 SNe Ia

that previously discovered early-excess SNe Ia show a clear preference for
specific SN Ia subclasses. In particular, the early-excess feature shown in all
six luminous (91T- and 99aa-like) SNe Ia is in conflict with the viewing angle
dependence predicted by the companion-ejecta interaction scenario. Instead,
such a high early-excess fraction is likely related to the explosion physics of
luminous SNe Ia; i.e. a more efficient detonation happening in the progenitor
of luminous SNe Ia may consequently account for the early-excess feature
powered by the radiation from a $^{56}$Ni-abundant outer layer. The diversity
of early-excess features shown in different SN Ia subclasses suggests multiple
origins of the discovered early-excess SNe Ia, challenging their applicability
as a robust progenitor indicator. Further understanding of the early-excess
diversity relies not only on multiband photometry and prompt-response
spectroscopy of individual early-excess SNe Ia but also on investigations of
the general early-phase light-curve behavior of each SN Ia subclass, which can
be realized through ongoing/forthcoming transient survey projects in the near

non-interferometric phase retrieval approach, which enables quantitative phase
imaging (QPI) of transparent sample simply by measuring the intensities at
multiple axially displaced planes. Nevertheless, it still suffers from two
fundamentally limitations. First, it is quite susceptible to low-frequency
errors (such as \cloudy"" artifacts), which results from the poor contrast of
the phase transfer function (PTF) near the zero frequency. Second, the
reconstructed phase tends to blur under spatially low-coherent illumination,
especially when the defocus distance is beyond the near Fresnel region. Recent
studies have shown that the shape of the illumination aperture has a
significant impact on the resolution and phase reconstruction quality, and by
simply replacing the conventional circular illumination aperture with an
annular one, these two limitations can be addressed, or at least significantly
alleviated. However, the annular aperture was previously empirically designed
based on intuitive criteria related to the shape of PTF, which does not
guarantee optimality. In this work, we optimize the illumination pattern to
maximize TIE's performance based on a combined quantitative criterion for
evaluating the \goodness"" of an aperture. In order to make the size of the
solution search space tractable, we restrict our attention to binary coded
axis-symmetric illumination patterns only, which are easier to implement and
can generate isotropic TIE PTFs. We test the obtained optimal illumination by
imaging both a phase resolution target and HeLa cells based on a small-pitch
LED array, suggesting superior performance over other suboptimal patterns in
terms of both signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial resolution.

the usage of graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs). They have been shown
to provide a significant improvement on a wide range of tasks in network
analysis, one of which being node representation learning. The task of learning
low-dimensional node representations has shown to increase performance on a
plethora of other tasks from link prediction and node classification, to
community detection and visualization. Simultaneously, signed networks (or
graphs having both positive and negative links) have become ubiquitous with the
growing popularity of social media. However, since previous GCN models have
primarily focused on unsigned networks (or graphs consisting of only positive
links), it is unclear how they could be applied to signed networks due to the
challenges presented by negative links. The primary challenges are based on
negative links having not only a different semantic meaning as compared to
positive links, but their principles are inherently different and they form
complex relations with positive links. Therefore we propose a dedicated and
principled effort that utilizes balance theory to correctly aggregate and
propagate the information across layers of a signed GCN model. We perform
empirical experiments comparing our proposed signed GCN against
state-of-the-art baselines for learning node representations in signed

CrunchBase, a technology business directory to measure industrial capabilities

having experienced rapid growth and diffusion into new fields where it has
generated an impact, we describe changes in its geography. Our analysis shows
China's rise in AI rankings and relative decline in several European countries.
We also find that initial volatility in the geography of DL has been followed
by consolidation, suggesting that the window of opportunity for new entrants
might be closing down as new DL research hubs become dominant. Finally, we
study the regional drivers of DL clustering. We find that competitive DL
clusters tend to be based in regions combining research and industrial
activities related to it. This could be because GPT developers and adopters
located close to each other can collaborate and share knowledge more easily,
thus overcoming coordination failures in GPT deployment. Our analysis also
reveals a Chinese comparative advantage in DL after we control for other

evaluate the usefulness of R2RS metrics in predicting the set of classes

six natural language processing techniques to measure the semantic similarity
among texts (e.g., VSM) and three distribution scores to compute overall
similarity (e.g., average among similarity scores). We evaluate if R2RS is
useful for predicting impacted classes in combination and against four other
families of metrics that are based upon temporal locality of changes, direct
similarity to code, complexity metrics, and code smells. Our evaluation
features five classifiers and 78 releases belonging to four large open-source
projects, which result in over 700,000 candidate impacted classes. Experimental
results show that leveraging R2RS information increases the accuracy of
predicting impacted classes practically by an average of more than 60% across

problems that cause system degradation. Architectural smells are typical
symptoms of such problems, and several of these smells are related to undesired
dependencies among modules. The early detection of these smells is important
for developers, because they can plan ahead for maintenance or refactoring
efforts, thus preventing system degradation. Existing tools for identifying
architectural smells can detect the smells once they exist in the source code.
This means that their undesired dependencies are already created. In this work,
we explore a forward-looking approach that is able to infer groups of likely
module dependencies that can anticipate architectural smells in a future system
version. Our approach considers the current module structure as a network,
along with information from previous versions, and applies link prediction
techniques (from the field of social network analysis). In particular, we focus
on dependency-related smells, such as Cyclic Dependency and Hublike Dependency,
which fit well with the link prediction model. An initial evaluation with two
open-source projects shows that, under certain considerations, the predictions
of our approach are satisfactory. Furthermore, the approach can be extended to
other types of dependency-based smells or metrics.

  Process Analysis of Spatio-Temporal Brain Changes",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by complex and largely unknown
progression dynamics affecting the brain's morphology. Although the disease
evolution spans decades, to date we cannot rely on long-term data to model the
pathological progression, since most of the available measures are on a
short-term scale. It is therefore difficult to understand and quantify the
temporal progression patterns affecting the brain regions across the AD
evolution. In this work, we tackle this problem by presenting a generative
model based on probabilistic matrix factorization across temporal and spatial
sources. The proposed method addresses the problem of disease progression
modelling by introducing clinically-inspired statistical priors. To promote
smoothness in time and model plausible pathological evolutions, the temporal
sources are defined as monotonic and independent Gaussian Processes. We also
estimate an individual time-shift parameter for each patient to automatically
position him/her along the sources time-axis. To encode the spatial continuity
of the brain sub-structures, the spatial sources are modeled as Gaussian random
fields. We test our algorithm on grey matter maps extracted from brain
structural images. The experiments highlight differential temporal progression
patterns mapping brain regions key to the AD pathology, and reveal a
disease-specific time scale associated with the decline of volumetric
biomarkers across clinical stages.

question: under what conditions such a system behaves as a single object? It is
obvious that if the attraction between the particles is stronger than any other
force acting on them the whole system behaves as one. However, recent insight
from the quantum information theory suggests that in bipartite systems it is
not attraction per se that is responsible for the composite nature, but the
entanglement between the parts. Since entanglement can be present between the
subsystems that interacted in the past, but do not interact anymore, it is
natural to ask when such an entangled pair behaves as a single object. We show
that there are situations when entanglement is enough to observe
single-particle behaviour. However, due to the no-signalling condition, in
general an interaction, or a post-selective measurement, is necessary for a
complex collective behaviour.

splitting (hfs) in the 1S state of muonic hydrogen $\Delta E_{hfs}(\mu^-p)1S$.
The physical process behind this experiment is the following: $\mu p$ are
formed in a mixture of hydrogen and a higher-Z gas. When absorbing a photon at
resonance-energy $\Delta E_{hfs}\approx0.182$~eV, in subsequent collisions with
the surrounding $H_2$ molecules, the $\mu p$ is quickly de-excited and
accelerated by $\sim2/3$ of the excitation energy. The observable is the time
distribution of the K-lines X-rays emitted from the $\mu Z$ formed by muon
transfer $(\mu p) +Z \rightarrow (\mu Z)^*+p$, a reaction whose rate depends on
the $\mu p$ kinetic energy. The maximal response, to the tuned laser
wavelength, of the time distribution of X-ray from K-lines of the $(\mu Z)^*$
cascade indicate the resonance. During the preparatory phase of the FAMU
experiment, several measurements have been performed both to validate the
methodology and to prepare the best configuration of target and detectors for
the spectroscopic measurement. We present here the crucial study of the energy
dependence of the transfer rate from muonic hydrogen to oxygen ($\Lambda_{\mu p
\rightarrow \mu O}$), precisely measured for the first time.

probability distribution enables us to establish a general uncertainty
principle for the weak values of two not necessarily Hermitian operators. This
new principle is a weak value analog of the Heisenberg-Robertson strong value
uncertainty principle. It leads to the conclusion that it is possible to
determine with high accuracy the simultaneous mean weak values of non-commuting
operators by judicious choice of the pre- and post-selected states. Generally,
when the time fluctuations of the two weak values are proportional to each
other there is no uncertainty limitation on their variances and, in principle,
their means can be determined with arbitrary precision even though their
corresponding operators do not commute. To exemplify these properties we
consider specific weak value uncertainty relations for the time-energy,
coordinate-momentum and coordinate-kinetic energy pairs. In addition we analyze
spin operators and the Stern-Gerlach experiment in weak and strong
inhomogeneous magnetic fields. This classic case leads to anomalous spin values
when the field is weak. However, anomalous spin values are also associated with
large variances implying that their measurement demands increased signal
averaging. These examples establish the importance of considering the time
dependence of weak values in time of flight scattering experiments.

magnetic anisotropy (MA) since the Mermin-Wagner theorem implies that
rotational symmetry cannot be spontaneously broken at finite temperatures in

materials that retains the magnetic order above room temperature. Magnetic
interactions are typically modeled in terms of Heisenberg models and the

demonstrate that classical Monte Carlo (MC) simulations correctly describe the

becomes small. A fit of the MC results leads to a simple expression for the
critical temperatures as a function of MA and exchange coupling constants,

rate on several astrophysical quantities, including orbital period, semi-major
axis, mass ratio, fill-out factor, temperature, and mass. We selected these
candidates using $O-C$ diagrams and calculated their mass-transfer rates.
Primary masses were obtained from the mass--temperature relation, and the
temperatures of the component stars were extracted from a catalog of
temperatures for Kepler eclipsing binary stars. The mass-transfer rates of
overcontact systems have associations with astrophysical quantities that seem
to differ from those of semi-detached or detached systems. These associations
indicate that mass exchange from more- to less-massive components (from less-
to more-massive components) generally becomes rapid (slow) as the mass exchange
evolves. However, for mass exchange from more- to less-massive components, this
tendency is not reasonable for binaries with a short period ($P<0.4$ d) and low
mass ($M_1<1.2$ M$_\odot$) because the correlations of these binaries are
opposite to those of binaries with long period and high mass. These different
correlations likely arise from differences in correlation between subtypes of W
UMa systems (i.e., W- and A-types). Alternatively, when mass exchange from
more- to less-massive components reoccurs after a mass-ratio reversal, its
properties may differ from those of the first mass exchange.

constructed from 2-D DFT based grid of beams, and enable the CSI feedback of
beam selection as well as PSK based co-phase combining between two
polarizations. Moreover, Type-2 codebook based CSI feedback reports the
wideband and subband amplitude information of the selected beams. As a result,
it is envisioned that more accurate CSI shall be obtained from the Type-2
codebook based CSI feedback so that better precoded MIMO transmission can be
employed by the network. To reduce the CSI feedback signaling, 1 bit based
subband amplitude with only two quantization levels is supported in combination
to 3 bits based wideband amplitude feedback. Typically, wideband amplitude
shall be calculated as the linear average amplitude of the beam over all
subbands. However, due to the coarse subband amplitude quantization, it has
been observed in case of joint wideband and subband amplitude feedback, the
average based wideband amplitude can lead to a large amplitude quantization
errors. In this paper, we study two methods for joint wideband and subband

proposed. The optimal method can achieve the minimum amplitude quantization
errors at the cost of a relatively large computation complexity. And by virtue
of a derived scaling factor, the sub-optimal method exhibits clearly smaller

Dynamic spectra show brightness variation of
pulsars in the time and frequency domain. Secondary spectra demonstrate the
distribution of fluctuation power in the dynamic spectra. Aims. Dynamic spectra
strongly depend on observational frequencies, but were often observed at
frequencies lower than 1.5 GHz. Scintillation observations at higher
frequencies help to constrain the turbulence feature of the interstellar medium
over a wide frequency range and can detect the scintillations of more distant
pulsars. Methods. Ten pulsars were observed at 2250 MHz (S-band) with the
Jiamusi 66 m telescope to study their scintillations. Their dynamic spectra
were first obtained, from which the decorrelation bandwidths and time scales of
diffractive scintillation were then derived by autocorrelation. Secondary
spectra were calculated by forming the Fourier power spectra of the dynamic
spectra. Results. Most of the newly obtained dynamic spectra are at the highest
frequency or have the longest time span of any published data for these
pulsars. For PSRs B0540+23, B2324+60 and B2351+61, these were the first dynamic
spectra ever reported. The frequencydependence of scintillation parameters
indicates that the intervening medium can rarely be ideally turbulent with a
Kolmogorov spectrum. The thin screen model worked well at S-band for the
scintillation of PSR B1933+16. Parabolic arcs were detected in the secondary
spectra of three pulsars, PSRs B0355+54, B0540+23 and B2154+40, all of which
were asymmetrically distributed. The inverted arclets of PSR B0355+54 were seen
to evolve along the main parabola within a continuous observing session of 12
hours, from which the angular velocity of the pulsar was estimated that was
consistent with the measurement by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI).

profound connections to the complexity of the fundamental cryptographic
primitives: collision-resistant hash functions and one-way permutations. In
contrast to most of the other subclasses of TFNP, no complete problem is known
for PPP. Our work identifies the first PPP-complete problem without any circuit
or Turing Machine given explicitly in the input, and thus we answer a
longstanding open question from [Papadimitriou1994]. Specifically, we show that
constrained-SIS (cSIS), a generalized version of the well-known Short Integer
Solution problem (SIS) from lattice-based cryptography, is PPP-complete.
  In order to give intuition behind our reduction for constrained-SIS, we
identify another PPP-complete problem with a circuit in the input but closely
related to lattice problems. We call this problem BLICHFELDT and it is the
computational problem associated with Blichfeldt's fundamental theorem in the
theory of lattices.
  Building on the inherent connection of PPP with collision-resistant hash
functions, we use our completeness result to construct the first natural hash
function family that captures the hardness of all collision-resistant hash
functions in a worst-case sense, i.e. it is natural and universal in the
worst-case. The close resemblance of our hash function family with SIS, leads
us to the first candidate collision-resistant hash function that is both
natural and universal in an average-case sense.
  Finally, our results enrich our understanding of the connections between PPP,
lattice problems and other concrete cryptographic assumptions, such as the
discrete logarithm problem over general groups.

time-varying treatments on a survival outcome. G-estimation and artificial
censoring have been proposed to estimate the model parameters in the presence
of time-dependent confounding and administrative censoring. However, most of
existing methods require manually preprocessing data into regularly spaced

computation and inference are challenging due to the non-smoothness of
artificial censoring. We propose a class of continuous-time structural failure
time models, which respects the continuous time nature of the underlying data
processes. Under a martingale condition of no unmeasured confounding, we show
that the model parameters are identifiable from potentially infinite estimating
equations. Using the semiparametric efficiency theory, we derive the first
semiparametric doubly robust estimators, in the sense that the estimators are
consistent if either the treatment process model or the failure time model is
correctly specified, but not necessarily both. Moreover, we propose using
inverse probability of censoring weighting to deal with dependent censoring. In

non-smoothness in estimation and ensures that the resampling methods can be
used to make inference.

pulsar glitches and gravitational wave emission. We aim to shed some light on
this problem by analysing uniaxial stretch deformation (elongation and
contraction) of perfect body-centered cubic Coulomb crystals, paying special
attention to the inherent anisotropy of this process. Our analysis is based on
the semi-analytical approach of Baiko and Kozhberov (2017), which, for any
uniform deformation, allows one to calculate, in fully non-linear regime,
critical deformation parameters beyond which the lattice loses its dynamic
stability. We determine critical strain, pressure anisotropy and deformation
energy for any stretch direction with respect to the crystallographic axes.
These quantities are shown to be strongly anisotropic: they vary by a factor of
almost 10 depending on the orientation of the deformation axis. For
polycrystalline crust, we argue that the maximum strain for the stretch
deformation sustainable elastically is 0.04. It is lower than the breaking
strain of 0.1 obtained in molecular dynamic simulations of a shear deformation
by Horowitz and Kadau (2009). The maximum pressure anisotropy of
polycrystalline matter is estimated to be in the range from 0.005 to 0.014
$nZ^2e^2/a$, where $n$ is the ion number density, $Ze$ is the ion charge, and
$a$ is the ion-sphere radius. We discuss possible mechanisms of plastic motion

energy release associated with breaking of such crystallites in the context of
magnetic field evolution and magnetar flaring activity.

often feature both noncompliance, when individuals within a cluster are not

each other through treatment spillovers where those who comply with the new
policy may affect the outcomes of those who do not. Here, we study the

combination with a sufficiently steep potential, $M_{\rm Pl} V_\phi/V \gtrsim
{\cal O}(1)$. Here, we show that the swampland conjectures are inconsistent
with existing observational constraints on single-field inflation. Focusing on
the observationally favoured class of concave potentials, we map the allowed
swampland region onto the $n_S$-$r$ ""zoo plot"" of inflationary models, and find
that consistency with the Planck satellite and BICEP2/Keck Array requires
$M_{\rm Pl} V_\phi/V \lesssim 0.1$ and $-0.02 \lesssim M_{\rm Pl}^2
V_{\phi\phi}/V < 0$, in strong tension with swampland conjectures. Extension to
non-canonical models such as DBI Inflation does not significantly weaken the
bound.

of their magnetic field, and especially its height stratification plays a
substantial role. There are mainly two methods to assess this stratification,
but they yield different magnetic gradients in the photospheric layers.
Determinations based on the different origin of several spectral lines and the
slope of their profiles result in gradients of -2 to -3G/km, or even steeper.
This is similar for the total magnetic field strength and for the vertical
component of the magnetic field. The other option is to determine the
horizontal partial derivatives of the magnetic field, and with the condition
divB=0, also the vertical derivative is known. With this method, gradients of
-0.5 G/km and shallower are obtained. Obviously, these results do not agree. If
chromospheric spectral lines are included, only shallow gradients around
-0.5G/km are encountered. Shallow gradients are also found from gyro-resonance
measurements in the radio wave range 300 - 2000GHz. Some indirect methods are
also considered, but they cannot clarify the total picture. An analysis of a
numerical simulation of a sunspot indicates a shallow gradient over a wide
height range, but with slightly steeper gradients in deep layers. Several ideas
to explain the discrepancy are also discussed. With no doubts cast on Maxwell's
equations, the first one is to look at the uncertainties of the formation
heights of spectral lines, but a wider range of these heights would require an
extension of the solar photosphere that is incompatible with observations and
the theory of stellar atmospheres. The problem of the height gradient of the
magnetic field in sunspots is still not solved.

unstable saddle equilibrium point is dependent on the material optical

  Statistical Behavior by Bayesian Model Averaging",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Projections of storm surge return levels are a basic requirement for
effective management of coastal risks. A common approach to estimate hazards
posed by extreme sea levels is to use a statistical model, which may use a time
series of a climate variable as a covariate to modulate the statistical model
and account for potentially nonstationary storm surge behavior. Previous work
using nonstationary statistical approaches, however, has demonstrated the
importance of accounting for the many inherent modeling uncertainties.
Additionally, previous assessments of coastal flood hazard using statistical
modeling have typically relied on a single climate covariate, which likely
leaves out important processes and leads to potential biases. Here, I employ
upon a recently developed approach to integrate stationary and nonstationary
statistical models, and examine the effects of choice of covariate time series
on projected flood hazard. Furthermore, I expand upon this approach by
developing a nonstationary storm surge statistical model that makes use of
multiple covariate time series: global mean temperature, sea level, North
Atlantic Oscillation index and time. I show that a storm surge model that
accounts for additional processes raises the projected 100-year storm surge
return level by up to 23 centimeters relative to a stationary model or one that
employs a single covariate time series. I find that the total marginal model
likelihood associated with each set of nonstationary models given by the
candidate covariates, as well as a stationary model, is about 20%. These
results shed light on how best to account for potential nonstationary coastal
surge behavior, and incorporate more processes into surge projections. By
including a wider range of physical process information and considering
nonstationary behavior, these methods will better enable modeling efforts to
inform coastal risk management.

star's envelope powered a burst that reached the Eddington limit. Radiation
pressure pushed the photosphere out to ~200 km, while the blackbody temperature
dropped to 0.45 keV. Previous observations of similar bursts were performed
with instruments that are sensitive only above 3 keV, and the burst signal was
weak at low temperatures. NICER's 0.2-12 keV passband enables the first
complete detailed observation of strong expansion bursts. The strong expansion
lasted only 0.6 s, and was followed by moderate expansion with a 20 km apparent
radius, before the photosphere finally settled back down at 3 s after the burst
onset. In addition to thermal emission from the neutron star, the NICER spectra
reveal a second component that is well fit by optically thick Comptonization.
During the strong expansion, this component is six times brighter than prior to
the burst, and it accounts for 71% of the flux. In the moderate expansion
phase, the Comptonization flux drops, while the thermal component brightens,
and the total flux remains constant at the Eddington limit. We speculate that
the thermal emission is reprocessed in the accretion environment to form the
Comptonization component, and that changes in the covering fraction of the star
explain the evolution of the relative contributions to the total flux.

of expanding the scattered field with resonant contributions only has not been
established. Here, we address these two issues while restricting our study to
the case of a dispersionless spherical scatterer. First, we derive the rigorous
pole expansion of the $T$-matrix coefficients that link the scattered to the
incident fields associated with an optical resonator. This expansion evinces
the existence of a non-resonant term. Second, in the time domain, the causality

generating more data for training deeper networks, as well as uncovering
underlying patterns in diagnoses and the patients suffering from them. By
training a VAE, on available data, it was able to learn the latent distribution

generally known in advance. This makes it hard to adequately devote resources
such as to best prevent or mitigate bottlenecks. While several authors have
shown how to predict traffic in a coarse grained manner by aggregating flows,
fine grained prediction of traffic at the level of individual flows, including
bursty traffic, is widely considered to be impossible. This paper shows, to the
best of our knowledge, the first approach to fine grained per flow traffic
prediction. In short, we introduce the Frequency-based Kernel Kalman Filter
(FKKF), which predicts individual flows' behavior based on measurements. Our
FKKF relies on the well known Kalman Filter in combination with a kernel to
support the prediction of non linear functions. Furthermore we change the
operating space from time to frequency space. In this space, into which we
transform the input data via a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), the peak
structures of flows can be predicted after gleaning their key characteristics,
with a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), from past and ongoing flows that
stem from the same socket-to-socket connection. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach on popular benchmark traces from a university
data center. Our approach predicts traffic on average across 17 out of 20
groups of flows with an average prediction error of 6.43% around 0.49 (average)
seconds in advance, whilst existing coarse grained approaches exhibit
prediction errors of 77% at best.

behaviour is dictated by a function of relative orientation, which represents
the amount of space excluded to one particle by another at this relative
orientation. We term this function the excluded volume function. Within the
context of two-dimensional convex bodies, we investigate this excluded volume
function for one-component systems addressing two related questions. Firstly,
given a body can we find the excluded volume function?, Secondly, can we
reconstruct a body from its excluded volume function? The former is readily
answered via an explicit Fourier series representation, in terms of the support
function. However we show the latter question is ill-posed in the sense that
solutions are not unique for a large class of bodies. This degeneracy is well
characterised however, with two bodies admitting the same excluded volume
function if and only if the Fourier coefficients of their support functions
differ only in phase. Despite the non-uniqueness issue, we then propose and
analyse a method for reconstructing a convex body given its excluded volume
function, by means of a discretisation procedure where convex bodies are
approximated by zonotopes with a fixed number of sides. It is shown that the
algorithm will always asymptotically produce a best $L^2$ approximation of the
trial function, within the space of excluded volume functions of centrally
symmetric bodies. In particular, if a solution exists, it can be found. Results
from a numerical implementation are presented, showing that with only desktop

coordinate systems in which the gravitational metric is only Lipschitz
continuous, but the connection $\Gamma$ and curvature $Riem(\Gamma)$ are both
in $L^{\infty}$. At this low level of regularity, the physical meaning of such
gravitational metrics remains problematic. Here we address the mathematical
problem as to whether the condition that $Riem(\Gamma)$ has the same regularity
as $\Gamma$, is sufficient for the existence of a coordinate transformation
which perfectly cancels out the jumps in the leading order derivatives of
$\delta\Gamma$, thereby raising the regularity of the connection and the metric
by one order--a subtle problem. We have now discovered, in a framework much
more general than GR shock waves, that the regularization of non-optimal
connections is determined by a nonlinear system of elliptic equations with
matrix valued differential forms as unknowns, the Regularity Transformation
equations, or RT-equations. In this paper we establish the first existence
theory for the nonlinear RT-equations in the general case when $\Gamma, {\rm
Riem}(\Gamma)\in W^{m,p}$, $m\geq1$, $n<p< \infty$, where $\Gamma$ is any
affine connection on an $n$-dimensional manifold. From this we conclude that
for any such connection $\Gamma(x) \in W^{m,p}$ with ${\rm Riem}(\Gamma) \in
W^{m,p}$, $m\geq1$, $n<p< \infty$, given in $x$-coordinates, there always
exists a coordinate transformation $x\to y$ such that $\Gamma(y) \in
W^{m+1,p}$. That is, $\Gamma$ exhibits optimal regularity in $y$-coordinates.
The problem of optimal regularity for the hyperbolic Einstein equations is thus
resolved by elliptic regularity theory in $L^p$-spaces applied to the
RT-equations.

storing filtered flow fields that target the large and intermediate scales,
while retaining all the information needed to fully reconstruct the flow at the
level of filtered flow fields and complete second-order statistics. This is
done by storing also the filtered turbulent stresses, allowing to recover the
exact effect of the small scales on the large and intermediate scales. A
significant speed-up of the computations is achieved, first, by relaxing the
numerical resolution, which is shown to affect only the dynamics close to the
wall, but not the large scales stored in the database, and, second, by
exploiting the \change{computing power and efficiency} of GPU co-processors
using a new high-resolution hybrid CUDA-MPI code. This speed-up allows running
for physically meaningful times to capture the dynamics of the large scales.
The resulting temporally resolved large-scale database of a turbulent channel
flow up to $Re_\tau=5300$, in large boxes for long times, is briefly

The color singlet grand potential allows us to elucidate the number of quarks

such a pair in dense quark matter. We furthermore determine the screening
length, which in the confinement phase is synonymous with the string breaking
distance. The screening length is a decreasing function of baryon density, due
to the possibility to break the interquark string via a scalar diquark
condensate at high density. We also study the large distance properties of the
color singlet grand potential in a dense medium and find that it is well
described by a simple Debye screening formula, parameterized by a Debye mass
and an effective coupling constant. The latter is of order of unity, i.e. even
at large density two-color quark matter is a strongly correlated system.

the acquisition of higher quality velocity cardiac images providing better
assessment of regional myocardial deformation for accurate disease diagnosis,
pre-operative planning and post-operative patient surveillance. Translation of
TPM velocities from the scanner's reference coordinate system to the regional
cardiac coordinate system requires decoupling of translational motion and
motion due to myocardial deformation. Despite existing techniques for
respiratory motion compensation in TPM, there is still a remaining
translational velocity component due to the global motion of the beating heart.
To compensate for translational motion in cardiac TPM, we propose an
image-processing method, which we have evaluated on synthetic data and applied
on in vivo TPM data. Methods: Translational motion is estimated from a suitable
region of velocities automatically defined in the left-ventricular volume. The
region is generated by dilating the medial axis of myocardial masks in each
slice and the translational velocity is estimated by integration in this
region. The method was evaluated on synthetic data and in vivo data corrupted
with a translational velocity component (200% of the maximum measured
velocity). Accuracy and robustness were examined and the method was applied on
10 in vivo datasets. Results: The results from synthetic and in vivo corrupted
data show excellent performance with an estimation error less than 0.3% and
high robustness in both cases. The effectiveness of the method is confirmed
with visual observation of results from the 10 datasets. Conclusion: The
proposed method is accurate and suitable for translational motion correction of
the left ventricular velocity fields. The current method for translational
motion compensation could be applied to any annular contracting (tissue)
structure.

is a novel differential equation for the DM number density, written down in a
form which is manifestly independent under the choice of what one would
interpret as a bound or a scattering state at finite temperature. The collision

to have in general a non-quadratic dependence on the DM number density. This
generalizes the form of the conventional Lee-Weinberg equation which is

technology for protecting sensitive computations from potentially compromised
system software. However, recent research has shown that SGX is vulnerable to
branch-shadowing -- a side channel attack that leaks the fine-grained (branch
granularity) control flow of an enclave (SGX protected code), potentially
revealing sensitive data to the attacker. The previously-proposed defense
mechanism, called Zigzagger, attempted to hide the control flow, but has been
shown to be ineffective if the attacker can single-step through the enclave
using the recent SGX-Step framework.
  Taking into account these stronger attacker capabilities, we propose a new
defense against branch-shadowing, based on control flow randomization. Our
scheme is inspired by Zigzagger, but provides quantifiable security guarantees
with respect to a tunable security parameter. Specifically, we eliminate
conditional branches and hide the targets of unconditional branches using a
combination of compile-time modifications and run-time code randomization.
  We evaluated the performance of our approach by measuring the run-time
overhead of ten benchmark programs of SGX-Nbench in SGX environment.

number Reg \sim 700 sustained LTBs are observed; most LTBs have the same

oceans; one without ocean heat transport (OHT) between grid cells as has been
commonly used in the exoplanet literature, while the other is a fully coupled
dynamic bathtub type ocean. The dynamical regime transitions that occur as day
length increases induce climate feedbacks producing cooler temperatures, first
via the reduction of water vapor with increasing rotation period despite
decreasing shortwave cooling by clouds, and then via decreasing water vapor and
increasing shortwave cloud cooling, except at the highest insolations.
Simulations without OHT are more sensitive to insolation changes for fast
rotations while slower rotations are relatively insensitive to ocean choice.
OHT runs with faster rotations tend to be similar with gyres transporting heat
poleward making them warmer than those without OHT. For slower rotations OHT is
directed equator-ward and no high latitude gyres are apparent. Uncertainties in
cloud parameterization preclude a precise determination of habitability but do
not affect robust aspects of exoplanet climate sensitivity. This is the first

massive pre-MS binaries and ask how large a fraction of the observed binary
systems may have been initially formed as low-mass protobinaries and later
undergone a significant accretion phase while remaining detached. We develop a
family of analytic models to describe the orbital separation, $a$, and mass
ratio, $q$, evolution. For a given mass accretion rate onto the binary system,
we define a recipe for distributing this mass between the two components. For
this we introduce a parameter $\eta$, such that
$\frac{\dot{M}_2}{\dot{M}_1}=q^\eta$ at any time, to determine the binary mass
ratio evolution. Depending on the choice of $\eta$, any type of mass ratio
evolution is possible. Furthermore, we use MESA, a detailed stellar structure
code, to calculate an extensive grid of binary sequences where a protobinary
undergoes accretion, and we identify the initial conditions that separates
detached from non-detached pre-MS binary evolution. A value of $\eta$ around 2
allows accretion growth in detached systems to form close massive binaries on
the Zero Age Main-Sequence with minimum orbital periods down to about 1.2 days
for $M_{\rm 1, ZAMS}=20-30M_{\odot}$ twin-binaries. $\eta=2$ can also reproduce
the observed population of binary systems with primary stars above

accretion growth in detached systems, making the binary formation channel of
accretion growth a strong contender to explain the formation of massive close

energy $E_{\textrm{D}} = -(118 \pm 1)$\,meV and a Dirac velocity
$v_{\textrm{D}} = (4.7 \pm 0.1)\cdot 10^{5}$\,m/s. Tunneling spectra often show
a superconducting gap, but temperature- and field-dependent measurements show
that both $T_{\rm C}$ and $\mu_0 H_{\rm C}$ strongly deviate from the
corresponding bulk values. Furthermore, in spite of acritical field value which
clearly points to type-II superconductivity, no Abrikosov lattice could be
observed. Experiments performed on normal-metallic Ag(111) prove that the
gapped spectrum is only caused by superconducting tips, probably caused by a
gentle crash with the sample surface during approach. Nearly identical results
were found for the intrinsically n-type compound Nb-doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$. Our
results suggest that the superconductivity in superconducting-doped V-VI
topological insulators does not extend to the surface where the topological
surface state is located.

we show how the onsite interaction between bosons affects the particle loss for
various strengths of dissipation. For moderate dissipation, the trend in
particle loss differs significantly near the superfluid-Mott boundary than the
deep superfluid regime. While the loss is suppressed for stronger dissipation
in the deep superfluid regime, revealing the typical quantum Zeno effect, the
loss near the phase boundary shows non-monotonic dependence on the dissipation
strength. We furthermore show that close to the phase boundary, the long-time
dynamics is well contrasted with the dissipative dynamics deep into the
superfluid regime. Thus the loss of particle due to dissipation may act as a
probe to differentiate strongly-correlated superfluid regime from its
weakly-correlated counterpart.

several previously measured resonances that cannot be experimentally reproduced

we develop a mass-scaled model that reproduces the observed binding energies of
$^{86}$Sr and $^{88}$Sr to within 1 MHz. In order to accurately reproduce the
deeper bound states, our model includes a second $1_u$ channel and more

boundary-layer flow and its response of the near-wall flows. Here, the
streamwise vortex tube is a lifted streamwise vortex. The circulation and
angle-to-wall of the vortex tube are varied. Circulation above a threshold
produces multiple hairpin vortices that align in the streamwise direction over
the vortex tube. Stability of the disturbances according to the situation of
the vortex tube inside the boundary layer such as the fraction of the vortex
tube inside the boundary layer in addition to the circulation and angle-to-wall
is shown by a linear stability analysis. The contribution of linear and
nonlinear terms in the dynamics of the disturbance evolution is clarified by a
fully-nonlinear disturbance analysis that is conducted concurrently with the
DNS. When the circulation is sufficiently large, two unstable modes, namely the
`off-wall mode' and `near-wall mode', appear. The presence of these two modes
generates a corkscrew-like disturbance around the vortex tube, and becomes a
precursor for the generation of hairpin vortices. The dominant structure of
disturbances appearing around the vortex tube along the elapse of time is also
analyzed by the proper orthogonal decomposition. The present DNS of the model
allowing continuous variation of the characteristics of the vortex tube
clarifies this new aspect of the nonlinear boundary-layer stability regarding
the generation of hairpin vortices.

prototypical compound, methylammonium lead iodide, CH3NH3PbI3 is a direct band
gap semiconductor with a band gap in the visible, high charge carrier mobility,
long diffusion length and low excitonic binding energy. Due to these ideal
properties, CH3NH3PbI3 is also drawing interest across many other applications

City and provides an example of a scalable solution that many other large
cities are already adopting around the world. Urban stakeholders who are
considering a similar deployment would largely benefit from a quantitative
assessment of the impact of bike sharing on urban transportation, as well as
associated economic, social and environmental implications. While the Citi Bike
usage data is publicly available, the main challenge of such an assessment is
to provide an adequate baseline scenario of what would have happened in the
city without the Citi Bike system. Existing efforts, including the reports of
Citi Bike itself, largely imply arbitrary and often unrealistic assumptions
about the alternative transportation mode people would have used otherwise
(e.g. by comparing bike trips against driving). The present paper offers a
balanced baseline scenario based on a transportation choice model to describe
projected customer behavior in the absence of the Citi Bike system. The model
also acknowledges the fact that Citi Bike might be used for recreational
purposes and, therefore, not all the trips would have been actually performed,
if Citi Bike would not be available. The model is trained using open Citi Bike
and other urban transportation data and it is applied to assess direct benefits
of Citi Bike trips for the end users, as well as for urban stakeholders across
different boroughs of New York City and the nearby Jersey City. Besides
estimating the travel time and cost savings, the model also reports the
associated gas savings, emissions cut and additional exercise for the
customers, covering all three areas of anticipated impacts - economic, social
and environmental.

$\rho=0.80$, simulations with the ion temperature gradient increased by $40\%$
above the nominal value give electron and ion heat fluxes that are in
simultaneous agreement with the experiment. This gradient increase is
consistent with the combined statistical and systematic uncertainty $\sigma$ of
the Charge Exchange Recombination Spectroscopy (CER) measurements at the $1.6
\sigma$ level. Multi-scale simulations are carried out with realistic mass
ratio and geometry for the first time in the near-edge. These multi-scale
simulations suggest that the highly unstable ion temperature gradient (ITG)
modes of the flux-matched ion-scale simulations suppress electron-scale
transport, such that ion-scale simulations are sufficient at this location. At
radial position $\rho=0.90$, nonlinear simulations show a hybrid state of ITG
and trapped electron modes~(TEMs), which was not expected from linear
simulations. The nonlinear simulations reproduce the total experimental heat
flux with the inclusion of $\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}$ shear effects and an
increase in the electron temperature gradient by $\sim 23\%$. This gradient
increase is compatible with the combined statistical and systematic uncertainty
of the Thomson scattering data at the $1.3 \sigma$ level. These results are
consistent with previous findings that gyrokinetic simulations are able to
reproduce the experimental heat fluxes by varying input parameters close to
their experimental uncertainties, pushing the validation frontier closer to the

the PUIs and solar wind ions based on the New Horizon and V2 spacecraft

in the HS and are quickly depleted. The depletion of PUIs cools the heliosphere
downstream of the TS, ""deflating"" it and leading to a narrower HS and a smaller

segments (also called windows, or patches), process them separately, and then
stitch them back into place to produce a unified output. At the overlaps, the
final value of those samples that are estimated more than once needs to be
decided in some way. Averaging, the simplest approach, often leads to
unsatisfactory results. Significant work has been devoted to this issue in
recent years. Several works explore the idea of a weighted average of the
overlapped patches and/or pixels; others promote agreement (consensus) between
the patches at their intersections. Agreement can be either encouraged or
imposed as a hard constraint. This work develops on the latter case. The result
is a variational signal processing framework, named PACO, which features a
number of appealing theoretical and practical properties. The PACO framework
consists of a variational formulation that fits a wide variety of problems, and
a general ADMMbased algorithm for minimizing the resulting energies. As a
byproduct, we show that the consensus step of the algorithm, which is the main
bottleneck of similar methods, can be solved efficiently and easily for any
arbitrary patch decomposition scheme. We demonstrate the flexibility and power
of PACO on three different problems: image inpainting (which we have already
covered in previous works), image denoising, and contrast enhancement, using
different cost functions including Laplacian and Gaussian Mixture Models.

Euclidean. A recurrent network with long term-short memory (LSTM) units encodes
the time-varying changes in the vector-momentum sequence, and a convolutional
neural network (CNN) encodes the baseline image of the vector momenta. Features
extracted by the LSTM and CNN are fed into a decoder network to reconstruct the
vector momentum sequence, which is used for the image sequence prediction by
deforming the baseline image with LDDMM shooting. To handle the missing images
at some time points, we adopt a binary mask to ignore their reconstructions in

$X-ray$. We collect data from several hospitals and public datasets. After
preprocess we get 3026 images including disease type VSD, ASD, TOF and normal
control. The main problem we have to solve is to enable the network to
accurately learn the characteristics of the heart, to ensure the reliability of
the network while increasing accuracy. By learning the doctor's diagnostic
experience, labeling the image and using tools to extract masks of heart
region, we train a U-net to generate a mask to give more attention. It forces
the model to focus on the characteristics of the heart region and obtain more
reliable results.

which seek to capture the `context' of users' activities on the basis of
actions they have performed recently. To capture such patterns, two approaches
have proliferated: Markov Chains (MCs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
Markov Chains assume that a user's next action can be predicted on the basis of
just their last (or last few) actions, while RNNs in principle allow for
longer-term semantics to be uncovered. Generally speaking, MC-based methods
perform best in extremely sparse datasets, where model parsimony is critical,
while RNNs perform better in denser datasets where higher model complexity is
affordable. The goal of our work is to balance these two goals, by proposing a
self-attention based sequential model (SASRec) that allows us to capture
long-term semantics (like an RNN), but, using an attention mechanism, makes its
predictions based on relatively few actions (like an MC). At each time step,
SASRec seeks to identify which items are `relevant' from a user's action
history, and use them to predict the next item. Extensive empirical studies
show that our method outperforms various state-of-the-art sequential models
(including MC/CNN/RNN-based approaches) on both sparse and dense datasets.
Moreover, the model is an order of magnitude more efficient than comparable
CNN/RNN-based models. Visualizations on attention weights also show how our
model adaptively handles datasets with various density, and uncovers meaningful
patterns in activity sequences.

  Community Detection","Accepted in IEEE SmartGridComm 2018 Conference",,,,"cs.SY physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A significant portion of the literature on fault localization assumes (more
or less explicitly) that there are sufficient reliable measurements to
guarantee that the system is observable. While several heuristics exist to
break the observability barrier, they mostly rely on recognizing
spatio-temporal patterns, without giving insights on how the performance are
tied with the system features and the sensor deployment. In this paper, we try
to fill this gap and investigate the limitations and performance limits of
fault localization using Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), in the low
measurements regime, i.e., when the system is unobservable with the
measurements available. Our main contribution is to show how one can leverage
the scarce measurements to localize different type of distribution line faults
(three-phase, single-phase to ground, ...) at the level of sub-graph, rather
than with the resolution of a line. We show that the resolution we obtain is
strongly tied with the graph clustering notion in network science.

materials is presented. The sensor is based on a depolarizing dipole resonator
loaded with printed capacitors whose capacitance depends on the permittivity of
the material located on contact with the tag. The permittivity is obtained from
the shift of the resonance frequency. The resonator is tested both individually
as well as placed on a periodic arrangement so as to form a frequency selective
structure (FSS) to increase the cross- polar radar cross section, thus
facilitating the tag detection. The proposed structure and measurement
procedure is particularly suitable for the characterization of civil materials
as a nondestructive testing (NDT).

electrolyte (PEO PAN) prepared by solution cast technique. Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy confirms the presence of microscopic interactions
such as polymer ion and ion ion interaction evidenced by a change in peak area
of anion stretching mode. The fraction of free anions and ion pairs obtained
from the analysis of FTIR implies that both influence the ionic conductivity
with different salt concentration. The complex dielectric permittivity,
dielectric loss, complex conductivity have been analyzed and fitted in the
entire frequency range (1 Hz to 1 MHz) at room temperature. The addition of
salt augments the dielectric constant and shift of relaxation peak in loss
tangent plot toward high frequency indicates a decrease of relaxation time. We
have implemented the Sigma representation sigma double prime vs sigma prime for
solid lithium ion conducting films which provide better insight toward
understating of the dispersion region in Cole Cole plot epsilon double prime vs
epsilon prime in lower frequency window. The dielectric strength, relaxation
time and hopping frequency are in correlation with the conductivity which
reveals the authenticity of results. Finally, the ion transport mechanism was
proposed for getting the better understanding of the ion migration in the
polymer matrix.

externally applied loads into electric charge. Existing processing routes used
to create pores of the desired geometry and degree of alignment appropriate for
ferroelectrets are based on complex mechanical stretching and chemical
dissolution steps. As a simple, cost effective and environmentally friendly
approach, freeze casting is able to produce aligned pores with almost all types
of the materials, including polymers. In this work, we present the first
demonstration of freeze casting to create polymeric ferroelectrets. The pore
morphology, phase analysis, relative permittivity and direct piezoelectric
charge coefficient (d33) of porous poly(vinylidene fluoride (PVDF)
ferroelectrets with porosity volume fractions ranging from 24% to 78% were
analysed. The long-range alignment of pore channels produced during directional
freezing was shown to be beneficial in forming a highly polarised structure
after breakdown of air in the pore channels via corona poling. This new method
opens a way to create tailored pores and voids in ferroelectret materials for
transducer applications related to sensors and vibration energy harvesting.
