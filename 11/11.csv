promising technologies, is coming to the telecommunications industry. Mesh
networking allows wider low cost Internet access with infrastructures built
from routers contributed by diverse owners, while blockchain enables
transparency and accountability for investments, revenue or other forms of
economic compensations from sharing of network traffic, content and services.
Crowdsourcing network coverage, combined with crowdfunding costs, can create
economically sustainable yet decentralized Internet access. This means every
participant can invest in resources, and pay or be paid for usage to recover
the costs of network devices and maintenance. While mesh networks and mesh
routing protocols enable self-organized networks that expand organically,
cryptocurrencies and smart contracts enable the economic coordination among
network providers and consumers. We explore and evaluate two existing
blockchain software stacks, Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) and Ethereum geth with
Proof of Authority (PoA) intended as a local lightweight distributed ledger,
deployed in a real city-wide production mesh network and also in laboratory
network. We quantify the performance, bottlenecks and identify the current
limitations and opportunities for improvement to serve locally the needs of
wireless mesh networks, without the privacy and economic cost of relying on
public blockchains.

scalability of compute-intensive iterative algorithms used in simulating
complex physical processes on supercomputer systems. The proposed methodology
is based on the BSF (Bulk Synchronous Farm) parallel computation model, which
makes it possible to predict the upper scalability bound of an iterative
algorithm in early phases of its design. The BSF model assumes the
representation of the algorithm in the form of operations on lists using
high-order functions. Two classes of representations are considered: BSF-M (Map
BSF) and BSF-MR (Map-Reduce BSF). The proposed methodology is described by the
example of the solution of the system of linear equations by the Jacobi method.
For the Jacobi method, two iterative algorithms are constructed: Jacobi-M based
on the BSF-M representation and Jacobi-MR based on the BSF-MR representation.
Analytical estimations of the speedup, parallel efficiency and upper
scalability bound are constructed for these algorithms using the BSF cost
metrics on multiprocessor computing systems with distributed memory. An
information about the implementation of these algorithms in C++ language using
the BSF program skeleton and MPI parallel programming library are given. The
results of large-scale computational experiments performed on a cluster
computing system are demonstrated. Based on the experimental results, an
analysis of the adequacy of estimations obtained analytically by using the cost
metrics of the BSF model is made.

many sources, such as sensor faults. Accordingly, anomaly detection is
important both for analyzing the anomalies themselves and for cleaning the data
for further analysis of its ambient structure. Nonetheless, a precise
definition of anomalies is important for automated detection and herein we
approach such problems from the perspective of detecting sparse latent effects
embedded in large collections of noisy data. Standard Graphical Lasso-based
techniques can identify the conditional dependency structure of a collection of
random variables based on their sample covariance matrix. However, classic
Graphical Lasso is sensitive to outliers in the sample covariance matrix. In
particular, several outliers in a sample covariance matrix can destroy the
sparsity of its inverse. Accordingly, we propose a novel optimization problem
that is similar in spirit to Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and
splits the sample covariance matrix $M$ into two parts, $M=F+S$, where $F$ is
the cleaned sample covariance whose inverse is sparse and computable by
Graphical Lasso, and $S$ contains the outliers in $M$. We accomplish this
decomposition by adding an additional $ \ell_1$ penalty to classic Graphical
Lasso, and name it ""Robust Graphical Lasso (Rglasso)"". Moreover, we propose an
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) solution to the optimization
problem which scales to large numbers of unknowns. We evaluate our algorithm on
both real and synthetic datasets, obtaining interpretable results and
outperforming the standard robust Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) method
and Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) regarding both accuracy and
speed.

(T1-IR) and T2-FLAIR and differential geometric features including the Jacobian
determinant(JD) and the curl vector(CV) derived from T1 modality can result in
a more accurate analysis of brain images. In this paper, we use the
differential geometric information including JD and CV as image characteristics
to measure the differences between different MRI images, which represent local
size changes and local rotations of the brain image, and we can use them as one
CNN channel with other three modalities (T1-weighted, T1-IR and T2-FLAIR) to
get more accurate results of brain segmentation. We test this method on two
datasets including IBSR dataset and MRBrainS datasets based on the deep
voxelwise residual network, namely VoxResNet, and obtain excellent improvement
over single modality or three modalities and increases average
DSC(Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), Gray Matter (GM) and White Matter (WM)) by about
1.5% on the well-known MRBrainS18 dataset and about 2.5% on the IBSR dataset.
Moreover, we discuss that one modality combined with its JD or CV information
can replace the segmentation effect of three modalities, which can provide
medical conveniences for doctor to diagnose because only to extract T1-modality
MRI image of patients. Finally, we also compare the segmentation performance of
our method in two networks, VoxResNet and U-Net network. The results show
VoxResNet has a better performance than U-Net network with our method in brain

been used to model phenomena in which the history of events influences future

only influence the future as long as they remain active. For example, a person
spreads a contagious disease only as long as they are contagious. In this
paper, we define a novel generalization of the Hawkes process that we call the
ephemerally self-exciting process. In this new stochastic process, the
excitement from one arrival lasts for a randomly drawn activity duration, hence
the ephemerality. Our study includes exploration of the process itself as well
as connections to well-known stochastic models such as branching processes,
random walks, epidemics, preferential attachment, and Bayesian mixture models.
Furthermore, we prove a batch scaling construction of general, marked Hawkes
processes from a general ephemerally self-exciting model, and this novel limit
theorem both provides insight into the Hawkes process and motivates the model
contained herein as an attractive self-exciting process in its own right.

problem, in which we seek to determine how many vertices a graph may have when
constrained to a given degree and diameter. Different variants of this problem
are obtained by considering further restrictions on the graph, such as whether
it is directed, undirected, mixed, vertex-transitive etc. The currently best
known extremal constructions are the G\'omez graphs, both when considered as
directed and undirected. As the G\'omez graphs are similar to the
Faber-Moore-Chen graphs, we give a natural generalisation of their definition
which we call word graphs. We then prove that the G\'omez graphs are as large
as possible word graphs for given degree and diameter. Further, we provide a
test to determine the full automorphism group of a word graph, and apply it to
the extremal directed G\'omez graphs to settle the previously open question of
when the G\'omez graphs are also Cayley graphs. Finally, we conclude with a
brief list of interesting related open problems.

$\operatorname{ed}(x, y)$ between two strings $x$ and $y$ in time parameterized
by the degree to which one of the strings $x$ satisfies a natural
pseudorandomness property. The pseudorandomness model is asymmetric in that no
requirements are placed on the second string $y$, which may be constructed by
an adversary with full knowledge of $x$.
  We say that $x$ is \emph{$(p, B)$-pseudorandom} if all pairs $a$ and $b$ of
disjoint $B$-letter substrings of $x$ satisfy $\operatorname{ed}(a, b) \ge pB$.
Given parameters $p$ and $B$, our algorithm computes the edit distance between
a $(p, B)$-pseudorandom string $x$ and an arbitrary string $y$ within a factor
of $O(1/p)$ in time $\tilde{O}(nB)$, with high probability.
  Our algorithm is robust in the sense that it can handle a small portion of
$x$ being adversarial (i.e., not satisfying the pseudorandomness property). In
this case, the algorithm incurs an additive approximation error proportional to
the fraction of $x$ which behaves maliciously.
  The asymmetry of our pseudorandomness model has particular appeal for the
case where $x$ is a \emph{source string}, meaning that $\operatorname{ed}(x,
y)$ will be computed for many strings $y$. Suppose that one wishes to achieve
an $O(\alpha)$-approximation for each $\operatorname{ed}(x, y)$ computation,
and that $B$ is the smallest block-size for which the string $x$ is $(1/\alpha,
B)$-pseudorandom. We show that without knowing $B$ beforehand, $x$ may be
preprocessed in time $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5}\sqrt{B})$, so that all future
computations of the form $\operatorname{ed}(x, y)$ may be
$O(\alpha)$-approximated in time $\tilde{O}(nB)$. Furthermore, for the special

  decomposition approach",,,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we first present a centralized traffic control model based on
the emerging dynamic path flows. This new model in essence views the whole
target network as one integral piece in which traffic propagates based on
traffic flow dynamics, vehicle paths, and traffic control. In light of this
centralized traffic control concept, most requirements for the existing traffic
control coordination will be dropped in the optimal traffic control operations,
such as the common cycle length or offsets. Instead, the optimal traffic
control strategy across intersections will be highly adaptive over time to
minimize the total travel time and it can also prevent any short-term traffic
congestions according to the space-time characteristics of vehicle path flows.
A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation is then presented to
model the propagations of path flows given a centralized traffic control
strategy. Secondly, a new approximated Lagrangian decomposition framework is
presented. Solving the proposed MILP model with the traditional Lagrangian
decomposition approach faces the leveraging challenge between the problem
tractability after decomposition and computing complexity. To address this
issue, we propose an approximate Lagrangian decomposition framework in which
the target problem is reformulated into an approximated problem by constructing
its complicating attributes into the objective function instead of in
constraints to reduce the computing complexity. The computing efficiency loss
of the objective function can be mitigated via multiple advanced computing
techniques. With the proposed approximated approach, the upper bound and tight
lower bound can be obtained via two customized dynamic network loading models.
In the end, one demonstrative and one real-world example are illustrated to
show the validness, robustness, and scalability of the new approach.

associated quality-factors (Q) as high as ~ 3.7. Such spectrally-narrow

resulting from a long momentum scattering time, which in our films can approach
~1 ps at room-temperature. Moreover, we demonstrate an ultrafast tunable

jets (jetlets), smaller than coronal X-ray jets but larger than chromospheric
spicules) in a coronal hole by using IRIS UV images and SDOAIA EUV images and
line-of-sight magnetograms from SDO/HMI. We observe recurring jetlets at the
edges of magnetic network flux lanes in the coronal hole. From magnetograms
co-aligned with the IRIS and AIA images, we find, clearly visible in nine
cases, that the jetlets stem from sites of flux cancelation proceeding at an
average rate of 1.5 X 10^18 Mx hr^{-1}, and show brightenings at their bases
reminiscent of the base brightenings in larger-scale coronal jets. We find that
jetlets happen at many locations along the edges of network lanes (not limited
to the base of plumes) with average lifetimes of 3 min and speeds of 70 kms.
The average jetlet-base width (4000 km) is three to four times smaller than for
coronal jets (18,000 km). Based on these observations of ten obvious jetlets,

desirable tension between: a- phases separation, each with its own specific

concepts and abstract mathematical constructs - as seldom linked before. The

  Jianyi Wang is the co-first author",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) has recently shown promising
advances on speeding up learning, improving the exploration, and discovering
intertask transferable skills. Most recent works focus on HRL with two levels,
i.e., a master policy manipulates subpolicies, which in turn manipulate
primitive actions. However, HRL with multiple levels is usually needed in many
real-world scenarios, whose ultimate goals are highly abstract, while their
actions are very primitive. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a
diversity-driven extensible HRL (DEHRL), where an extensible and scalable
framework is built and learned levelwise to realize HRL with multiple levels.
DEHRL follows a popular assumption: diverse subpolicies are useful, i.e.,
subpolicies are believed to be more useful if they are more diverse. However,
existing implementations of this diversity assumption usually have their own
drawbacks, which makes them inapplicable to HRL with multiple levels.
Consequently, we further propose a novel diversity-driven solution to achieve
this assumption in DEHRL. Experimental studies evaluate DEHRL with five
baselines from four perspectives in two domains; the results show that DEHRL
outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in all four aspects.

combined with normal scattering (hydrodynamic regime), and umklapp scattering

model interesting in the study of quantum gravity. It has been found that the
SYK model is similar to large $N$ tensor models: in both models, only the
melonic diagrams survive in the large $N$ limit. In this thesis, we explore the
large $N$ tensor model with $O(N)^3$ symmetry containing two flavors of

depends on a real parameter $\beta$. We derive the kernels of the four point

duality relation between two Hamiltonians of different values of $\beta$. This
is not a perfect duality, because the normalization of energy scales with the

Being
central for a user of a network leads to several benefits to the user: central
users are highly influential and play key roles within the network. Therefore,
the optimization problem of increasing the centrality of a network user
recently received considerable attention. Given a network and a target user
$v$, the centrality maximization problem consists in creating $k$ new links
incident to $v$ in such a way that the centrality of $v$ is maximized,
according to some centrality metric. Most of the algorithms proposed in the
literature are based on showing that a given centrality metric is monotone and
submodular with respect to link addition. However, this property does not hold
for several shortest-path based centrality metrics if the links are undirected.
In this paper we study the centrality maximization problem in undirected
networks for one of the most important shortest-path based centrality measures,
the coverage centrality. We provide several hardness and approximation results.
We first show that the problem cannot be approximated within a factor greater
than $1-1/e$, unless $P=NP$, and, under the stronger gap-ETH hypothesis, the
problem cannot be approximated within a factor better than $1/n^{o(1)}$, where
$n$ is the number of users. We then propose two greedy approximation
algorithms, and show that, by suitably combining them, we can guarantee an
approximation factor of $\Omega(1/\sqrt{n})$. We experimentally compare the

step toward formally devising an architecture composed of task planning and
control of whole-body dynamic locomotion behaviors in constrained and

specifications expressed in a fragment of temporal logic. Those actions are
sent to a robust finite transition system that synthesizes a locomotion

further executed via a low-level motion planner that generates feasible
locomotion trajectories. We construct a set of dynamic locomotion models for
legged robots to serve as a template library for handling diverse environmental
events. We devise a replanning strategy that takes into consideration sudden
environmental changes or large state disturbances to increase the robustness of
the resulting locomotion behaviors. We formally prove the correctness of the
layered locomotion framework guaranteeing a robust implementation by the motion

  Segmentation","Accepted by International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2019",,,,"cs.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a novel algorithm for point cloud segmentation. Our approach
transforms unstructured point clouds into regular voxel grids, and further uses
a kernel-based interpolated variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture to
encode the local geometry within each voxel. Traditionally, the voxel
representation only comprises Boolean occupancy information which fails to
capture the sparsely distributed points within voxels in a compact manner. In
order to handle sparse distributions of points, we further employ radial basis
functions (RBF) to compute a local, continuous representation within each
voxel. Our approach results in a good volumetric representation that
effectively tackles noisy point cloud datasets and is more robust for learning.
Moreover, we further introduce group equivariant CNN to 3D, by defining the
convolution operator on a symmetry group acting on $\mathbb{Z}^3$ and its
isomorphic sets. This improves the expressive capacity without increasing
parameters, leading to more robust segmentation results. We highlight the
performance on standard benchmarks and show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms on the ShapeNet and S3DIS datasets.

15. On the other hand, little is known about geometric graphs of any cop number
less than 15 and there is only one example of a geometric graph of cop number
three that has as many as 1440 vertices. In this paper we present a

moderate Reynolds numbers in a very long open channel flow. Direct numerical
simulations two-way coupled with inertial particles are analysed using spectral
information to investigate the modulation of VLSMs. In the wall-normal
direction, particle distributions (mean/preferential concentration) exhibit two
distinct behaviors in the inner flow and outer flow, corresponding to two
highly anisotropic turbulent structures, LSMs and VLSMs. This results in
particle inertia's non-monotonic effects on the VLSMs: low inertia (based on
the inner scale) and high inertia (based on the outer scale) both strengthen
the VLSMs whereas moderate and very high inertia have little influence. Through
conditional tests, low and high inertia particles enhance VLSMs following two
distinct routes. Low inertia particles promote VLSMs indirectly through the
enhancement of the regeneration cycle (the self-sustaining mechanism of LSMs)
in the inner region whereas high inertia particles enhance the VLSM directly
through contribution to the Reynolds shear stress at similar temporal scales in
the outer region. This understanding also provides more general insight into
inner-outer interaction in high Reynolds number, wall-bounded flows.

result of an oscillating shock that radially propagates towards or away from
the compact object. The third method is based on scaling a mass dependent
parameter from an empirical model of the photon index ($\Gamma$) - QPO ($\nu$)

Policy interventions targeting prescription opioid use, opioid use disorder,

choose the effective distance covered by the driver on a carpool trip as the
reward. Therefore, the more effective distance a driver achieves over a trip
(i.e. to satisfy more trip demand) the higher the efficiency and the less will
be the traffic congestion. We compared the performance of RL learned policy to
a fixed policy (which always accepts carpool) as a baseline and obtained
promising results that are interpretable and demonstrate the advantage of our
RL approach. We also compare the performance of ST-NN to that of

  Convolutional Residual Network","8 pages, 6 figures, AAAI 2019 camera-ready version",,,,"cs.SD cs.MM eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Music creation is typically composed of two parts: composing the musical
score, and then performing the score with instruments to make sounds. While
recent work has made much progress in automatic music generation in the
symbolic domain, few attempts have been made to build an AI model that can
render realistic music audio from musical scores. Directly synthesizing audio
with sound sample libraries often leads to mechanical and deadpan results,
since musical scores do not contain performance-level information, such as
subtle changes in timing and dynamics. Moreover, while the task may sound like
a text-to-speech synthesis problem, there are fundamental differences since
music audio has rich polyphonic sounds. To build such an AI performer, we
propose in this paper a deep convolutional model that learns in an end-to-end
manner the score-to-audio mapping between a symbolic representation of music
called the piano rolls and an audio representation of music called the
spectrograms. The model consists of two subnets: the ContourNet, which uses a
U-Net structure to learn the correspondence between piano rolls and
spectrograms and to give an initial result; and the TextureNet, which further
uses a multi-band residual network to refine the result by adding the spectral
texture of overtones and timbre. We train the model to generate music clips of
the violin, cello, and flute, with a dataset of moderate size. We also present
the result of a user study that shows our model achieves higher mean opinion
score (MOS) in naturalness and emotional expressivity than a WaveNet-based
model and two commercial sound libraries. We open our source code at

  Free Face Recognition",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using heterogeneous depth cameras and 3D scanners in 3D face verification
causes variations in the resolution of the 3D point clouds. To solve this
issue, previous studies use 3D registration techniques. Out of these proposed
techniques, detecting points of correspondence is proven to be an efficient
method given that the data belongs to the same individual. However, if the data
belongs to different persons, the registration algorithms can convert the 3D
point cloud of one person to another, destroying the distinguishing features
between the two point clouds. Another issue regarding the storage size of the
point clouds. That is, if the captured depth image contains around 50 thousand
points in the cloud for a single pose for one individual, then the storage size
of the entire dataset will be in order of giga if not tera bytes. With these
motivations, this work introduces a new technique for 3D point clouds
generation using a neural modeling system to handle the differences caused by
heterogeneous depth cameras, and to generate a new face canonical compact
representation. The proposed system reduces the stored 3D dataset size, and if
required, provides an accurate dataset regeneration. Furthermore, the system
generates neural models for all gallery point clouds and stores these models to
represent the faces in the recognition or verification processes. For the probe
cloud to be verified, a new model is generated specifically for that particular
cloud and is matched against pre-stored gallery model presentations to identify
the query cloud. This work also introduces the utilization of Siamese deep
neural network in 3D face verification using generated model representations as
raw data for the deep network, and shows that the accuracy of the trained
network is comparable all published results on Bosphorus dataset.

becoming traceable, and thus the studies of social networks attract increasing
attention from academia. It is widely believed that social networks play
important role in the process of information diffusion. However, the opposite
question, i.e., how does information diffusion process rebuild social networks,
has been largely ignored. In this paper, we propose a new framework for
understanding this reversing effect. Specifically, we first introduce a novel
information diffusion model on social networks, by considering two types of
individuals, i.e., smart and normal individuals, and two kinds of messages,
true and false messages. Since social networks consist of human individuals,
who have self-learning ability, in such a way that the trust of an individual
to one of its neighbors increases (or decreases) if this individual received a
true (or false) message from that neighbor. Based on such a simple
self-learning mechanism, we prove that a social network can indeed become
smarter, in terms of better distinguishing the true message from the false one.
Moreover, we observe the emergence of social stratification based on the new
model, i.e., the true messages initially posted by an individual closer to the
smart one can be forwarded by more others, which is enhanced by the
self-learning mechanism. We also find the crossover advantage, i.e.,
interconnection between two chain networks can make the related individuals
possessing higher social influences, i.e., their messages can be forwarded by
relatively more others. We obtained these results theoretically and validated
them by simulations, which help better understand the reciprocity between
social networks and information diffusion.

$\textbf{X}$ by repeatedly submitting queries (guesses) of the form ""Is
$\textbf{X}$ equal to $\textbf{x}$?"" until an affirmative answer is obtained.
In this setup, a key figure of merit is the number of queries required until
the right vector is identified, a number that is termed the \emph{guesswork}.
Typically, one wishes to devise a guessing strategy which minimizes a certain
guesswork moment.
  In this work, we study a universal, decentralized scenario where the guesser
does not know the distribution of $\textbf{X}$, and is not allowed to use a
strategy which prepares a list of words to be guessed in advance, or even
remember which words were already used. Such a scenario is useful, for example,
if bots within a Botnet carry out a brute-force attack in order to guess a
password or decrypt a message, yet cannot coordinate the guesses between them
or even know how many bots actually participate in the attack.
  We devise universal decentralized guessing strategies, first, for memoryless
sources, and then generalize them for finite-state sources. In each case, we
derive the guessing exponent, and then prove its asymptotic optimality by
deriving a compatible converse bound. The strategies are based on randomized
guessing using a universal distribution. We also extend the results to guessing
with side information. Finally, for all above scenarios, we design efficient
algorithms in order to sample from the universal distributions, resulting in
strategies which do not depend on the source distribution, are efficient to
implement, and can be used asynchronously by multiple agents.

singular effective properties for what would traditionally be considered non
locally resonant 2-phase phononic unit cells. The negative effective material
properties reported here occur well below the homogenization limit and are,
therefore, acceptable descriptions of overall behavior. The material property
combinations which make this possible were first revealed by a novel level set
based topology optimization process which we describe. The optimization process
revealed that a 2-phase unit cell in which one of the phases is simultaneously
lighter and stiffer than the other results in dynamic behavior which has all
the attendant characteristics of a locally resonant composite including
negative effective properties far below the homogenization limit. We
investigate this further using the Craig-Bampton decomposition and clarify that
these properties emerge through an interplay between the fundamental internal
modeshape of the unit cell and a rigid body mode. Through explicit numerical
calculations on 1-D, 2-phase unit cells, we show that negative effective
properties only appear for the specific material property combination mentioned
above. Furthermore, we provide a proof which supports this conclusion. The
concept is also shown to hold for 2-D unit cells where we show that an
appropriately designed hexagonal unit cell made of 2 material phases exhibits
negative effective shear modulus and density in an appropriate frequency regime
in which it also exhibits negative refraction. An important conclusion of this
paper is that the class of unit cells expected to result in negative properties
can be expanded beyond the classic unit cell (three-phase unit cells with an
explicit locally resonant phase) to include topologically simpler 2-phase unit
cells as well.

waiting for concurrent stateless clients and allows overall throughput to scale
gracefully, without requiring trusted third party components (proxies) or
direct inter-client coordination. A key insight behind ConcurORAM is the fact
that, during multi-client data access, only a subset of the
concurrently-accessed server-hosted data structures require access privacy
guarantees. Everything else can be safely implemented as oblivious data
structures that are later synced securely and efficiently during an ORAM
""eviction"". Further, since a major contributor to latency is the eviction - in
which client-resident data is reshuffled and reinserted back encrypted into the
main server database - ConcurORAM also enables multiple concurrent clients to
evict asynchronously, in parallel (without compromising consistency), and in
the background without having to block ongoing queries. As a result, throughput
scales well with increasing number of concurrent clients and is not
significantly impacted by evictions. For example, about 65 queries per second
can be executed in parallel by 30 concurrent clients, a 2x speedup over the
state-of-the-art. The query access time for individual clients increases by
only 2x when compared to a single-client deployment.

which is caused by the sparsity of user-product interactions and the diversity
of individual users' vocabularies. Second, a user's interests on aspects could
be different with respect to different products, which are usually assumed to
be static in existing methods. In this paper, we propose an Attentive
Aspect-based Recommendation Model (AARM) to tackle these challenges. For the
first problem, to enrich the aspect connections between user and product,
besides common aspects, AARM also models the interactions between synonymous

simultaneously considers user, product and aspect information is constructed to
capture a user's attention towards aspects when examining different products.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments show that AARM can
effectively alleviate the two aforementioned problems and significantly
outperforms several state-of-the-art recommendation methods on top-N

involves a collection of parallel and pipelined TCP flows. As the standard TCP
congestion control mechanism is designed for achieving ""fairness"" among
competing flows and is agnostic to the application layer contexts, the
bandwidth allocation among a set of TCP flows traversing bottleneck links often
leads to sub-optimal application-layer performance measures, e.g., stream
processing throughput or average tuple complete latency.
  Motivated by this and enabled by the rapid development of the
Software-Defined Networking (SDN) techniques, in this paper, we re-investigate
the design space of the bandwidth allocation problem and propose a cross-layer
framework which utilizes the additional information obtained from the
application layer and provides on-the-fly and dynamic bandwidth adjustment
algorithms for helping the stream analytics applications achieving better
performance during the runtime.
  We implement a prototype cross-layer bandwidth allocation framework based on
a popular open-source distributed stream processing platform, Apache Storm,
together with the OpenDaylight controller, and carry out extensive experiments
with real-world analytical workloads on top of a local cluster consisting of 10
workstations interconnected by a SDN-enabled switch. The experiment results
clearly validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework and

G339.88-1.26 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array. The
observations reveal a highly collimated SiO jet extending from the 1.3 mm
continuum source, which connects to a slightly wider but still highly
collimated CO outflow. Rotational features perpendicular to the outflow axis
are detected in various molecular emissions, including SiO, SO2, H2S, CH3OH,
and H2CO emissions. Based on their spatial distributions and kinematics, we
find that they trace different parts of the envelope-disk system. The SiO
emission traces the disk and inner envelope in addition to the jet. The CH3OH
and H2CO emissions mostly trace the infalling-rotating envelope, and are
enhanced around the transition region between envelope and disk, i.e., the
centrifugal barrier. The SO2 and H2S emissions are enhanced around the
centrifugal barrier, and also trace the outer part of the disk. Envelope
kinematics are consistent with rotating-infalling motion, while those of the
disk are consistent with Keplerian rotation. The radius and velocity of the
centrifugal barrier are estimated to be about 530 au and 6 km/s, leading to a
central mass of about 11 solar masses, consistent with estimates based on
spectral energy distribution fitting. These results indicate that an ordered
transition from an infalling-rotating envelope to a Keplerian disk through a
centrifugal barrier, accompanied by changes of types of molecular line
emissions, is a valid description of this massive protostellar source. This
implies that at least some massive stars form in a similar way as low-mass
stars via Core Accretion.

the active convolution unit (ACU), which can freely define its shape and learn
by itself. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of the previously

observe multiple receptive fields in one layer. We found that the performance
of a naive grouped convolution is degraded by increasing the number of groups;

topological band-gap, a chiral bound state emerges, which is located at just
one side (right or left) of the emitter. In the presence of several emitters,
it mediates topological, long-range tunable interactions between them, that can
give rise to exotic phases such as double N\'eel ordered states. On the
contrary, when the emitters' optical transition is resonant with the bands, we
find unconventional scattering properties and different super/subradiant states

recommender systems in industry, owing to its strength in user interest
modeling and ease in online personalization. By constructing a user's profile
with the items that the user has consumed, ICF recommends items that are
similar to the user's profile. With the prevalence of machine learning in
recent years, significant processes have been made for ICF by learning item
similarity (or representation) from data. Nevertheless, we argue that most
existing works have only considered linear and shallow relationship between
items, which are insufficient to capture the complicated decision-making
process of users.
  In this work, we propose a more expressive ICF solution by accounting for the
nonlinear and higher-order relationship among items. Going beyond modeling only
the second-order interaction (e.g. similarity) between two items, we
additionally consider the interaction among all interacted item pairs by using
nonlinear neural networks. Through this way, we can effectively model the
higher-order relationship among items, capturing more complicated effects in
user decision-making. For example, it can differentiate which historical
itemsets in a user's profile are more important in affecting the user to make a
purchase decision on an item. We treat this solution as a deep variant of ICF,
thus term it as DeepICF. To justify our proposal, we perform empirical studies
on two public datasets from MovieLens and Pinterest. Extensive experiments
verify the highly positive effect of higher-order item interaction modeling
with nonlinear neural networks. Moreover, we demonstrate that by more
fine-grained second-order interaction modeling with attention network, the
performance of our DeepICF method can be further improved.

iridate proposed to be a close realization of the Kitaev honeycomb model. To
test this assertion we perform detailed quantum chemistry calculations to
determine the magnetic interactions between Ir moments. We find that weakly
bond dependent ferromagnetic Kitaev exchange dominates over other couplings,
but still is substantially lower than in Na$_2$IrO$_3$. This reduction is
caused by the peculiar position of the inter-layer species: removing hydrogen
cations next to a Ir$_2$O$_2$ plaquette increases the Kitaev exchange by more
than a factor of three on the corresponding Ir-Ir link. Consequently any lack
of hydrogen order will have a drastic effect on the magnetic interactions and
strongly promote spin disordering.

high-mass protostellar object at an intersection of two line-shaped filaments
in $^{13}$CO with the length scale of $\sim$10 pc, the spatially resolved

the 1.3 mm continuum emission, the N159W-South clump, show complicated

redshifted/blueshifted components of the $^{13}$CO emission around the massive

earlier scenario of cloud-cloud collision, by Fukui et al., that postulated the
two filamentary clouds occur prior to the high-mass star formation. A recent
theoretical study of the shock compression in colliding molecular flows by
Inoue et al. demonstrates that the formation of filaments with hub structure is
a usual outcome of the collision, lending support for the present scenario. The

galaxy, M33, unveils strong tangled magnetic field along the spiral arms and in
the galaxy center indicating amplification due to compression and local shear

rotation speed of galaxies. The total and disordered magnetic fields scales
with the star formation rate in normal star forming galaxies. On the other
hand, a strong magnetic field in the center of NGC 1097 -- a massive galaxy
undergoing quenching -- is found responsible for decelerating its massive star
formation. Putting these results together, it is deduced that 1) the Universe
was highly magnetized short after the peak of the massive star birth at about 1
Gyr after the Big Bang and 2) the strong magnetic field has possibly acted as
back reaction after this time, quenching the massive star formation and
stimulating the creation of low-mass stars in massive galaxies.

class applications. An efficient way to convert such large many-class
pre-trained networks into small few-class networks is through a hierarchical
decomposition of its feature maps. To alleviate this issue, we propose an
automated framework for such decomposition in Hierarchically Self Decomposing
CNN (HSD-CNN), in four steps. HSD-CNN is derived automatically using a
class-specific filter sensitivity analysis that quantifies the impact of
specific features on a class prediction. The decomposed hierarchical network
can be utilized and deployed directly to obtain sub-networks for a subset of
classes, and it is shown to perform better without the requirement of
retraining these sub-networks. Experimental results show that HSD-CNN generally
does not degrade accuracy if the full set of classes are used. Interestingly,
when operating on known subsets of classes, HSD-CNN has an improvement in
accuracy with a much smaller model size, requiring much fewer operations.
HSD-CNN flow is verified on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and CALTECH101 data sets. We
report accuracies up to $85.6\%$ ( $94.75\%$ ) on scenarios with 13 ( 4 )

advising introduction of a tensor spin chemical potential that plays a role of
the Lagrange multiplier coupled to the spin angular momentum. Then, we turn to
a discussion of spin-dependent distribution functions that have been recently
proposed to construct a hydrodynamic framework including spin and serve as a
tool in phenomenological studies of hadron polarization. Distribution functions
of this type are subsequently used to construct the equilibrium Wigner
functions that are employed in the semi-classical kinetic equation. The
semi-classical expansion elucidates several aspects of the hydrodynamic
approach, in particular, shows the ways in which different possible versions of
hydrodynamics with spin can be connected by pseudo-gauge transformations. These
results point out at using the de~Groot - van~Leeuwen - van~Weert versions of
the energy-momentum and spin tensors as the most natural and complete physical
variables. Finally, a totally new method is proposed to design hydrodynamics
with spin, which is based on the classical treatment of spin degrees of
freedom. Interestingly, for small values of the spin chemical potential the new
scheme brings the results that coincide with those obtained before. The
classical approach also helps us to resolve problems connected with the
normalization of the spin polarization three-vector. In addition, it clarifies
the role of the Pauli-Lubanski vector and the entropy current conservation. We
close our review with several general comments presenting possible future
developments of the discussed frameworks.

asymptotic stabilization towards a self-similar solution, and the latter is a

structure and to predict the missing entries of data matrix. In many real-world
learning systems, the data matrix can be very high-dimensional but sparse. This
poses an imbalanced learning problem, since the scale of missing entries is
usually much larger than that of observed entries, but they cannot be ignored
due to the valuable negative signal. For efficiency concern, existing work
typically applies a uniform weight on missing entries to allow a fast learning
algorithm. However, this simplification will decrease modeling fidelity,
resulting in suboptimal performance for downstream applications.
  In this work, we weight the missing data non-uniformly, and more generically,
we allow any weighting strategy on the missing data. To address the efficiency
challenge, we propose a fast learning method, for which the time complexity is
determined by the number of observed entries in the data matrix, rather than
the matrix size. The key idea is two-fold: 1) we apply truncated SVD on the
weight matrix to get a more compact representation of the weights, and 2) we
learn MF parameters with element-wise alternating least squares (eALS) and
memorize the key intermediate variables to avoid repeating computations that
are unnecessary. We conduct extensive experiments on two recommendation
benchmarks, demonstrating the correctness, efficiency, and effectiveness of our
fast eALS method.

topological insulators (HOTIs). So far, the HOTIs are only demonstrated in
discrete mechanical and electromagnetic systems and electrical circuits with
the quantized quadrupole polarization. Here, we realize the higher-order
topological states in a two-dimensional (2D) continuous elastic system whose
energy bands can be well described. We experimentally observe the gapped

the trivial corner modes, the topological ones, immunizing against defects, are
robustly localized at the obtuse-angled but not the acute-angled corners. The
topological shape-dependent corner states open a new route for the design of

minimal) weight, such that $f(\alpha)= 1$."" is considered here. It is closely
related to the problem of fast computing the algebraic degree of Boolean
functions. It is an important cryptographic parameter used in the design of
S-boxes in modern block ciphers, PRNGs in stream ciphers, at Reed-Muller codes,
etc. To find effective solutions to this problem we explore the orders of the
vectors of the $n$-dimensional Boolean cube $\{0,1\}^n$ in accordance with
their weights. The notion of ""$k$-th layer"" of $\{0,1\}^n$ is involved in the
definition and examination of the ""weight order"" relation. It is compared with
the known relation ""precedes"". Several enumeration problems concerning these
relations are solved and the corresponding comments were added to 3 sequences
in the On-line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). One special order
(among the numerous weight orders) is defined and examined in detail. The
lexicographic order is a second criterion for an ordinance of the vectors of
equal weights. So a total order called Weight-Lexicographic Order (WLO) is
obtained. Two algorithms for generating the WLO sequence and two algorithms for
generating the characteristic vectors of the layers are proposed. Their results
were used in creating 2 new sequences: A294648 and A305860 in the OEIS. Two
algorithms for solving the problem considered are developed--the first one
works in a byte-wise manner and uses the WLO sequence, and the second one works
in a bitwise manner and uses the characteristic vector as masks. The
experimental results after many tests confirm the efficiency of these
algorithms. Some other applications of the obtained algorithms are also
discussed--for example, when representing, generating and ranking other
combinatorial objects.

computing a $(1\pm\epsilon)$-approximation of the number of $k$-cliques in $G$.
The standard query model for general graphs allows for degree queries, neighbor
queries, and pair queries. Let $n$ be the number of vertices, $m$ be the number
of edges, and $n_k$ be the number of $k$-cliques. Previous work by Eden, Ron
and Seshadhri (STOC 2018) gives an $O^*(\frac{n}{n^{1/k}_k} +
\frac{m^{k/2}}{n_k})$-time algorithm for this problem (we use $O^*(\cdot)$ to
suppress $\poly(\log n, 1/\epsilon, k^k)$ dependencies). Moreover, this bound
is nearly optimal when the expression is sublinear in the size of the graph.
  Our motivation is to circumvent this lower bound, by parameterizing the
complexity in terms of \emph{graph arboricity}. The arboricity of $G$ is a
measure for the graph density ""everywhere"". We design an algorithm for the
class of graphs with arboricity at most $\alpha$, whose running time is
$O^*(\min\{\frac{n\alpha^{k-1}}{n_k},\, \frac{n}{n_k^{1/k}}+\frac{m
\alpha^{k-2}}{n_k} \})$. We also prove a nearly matching lower bound. For all
graphs, the arboricity is $O(\sqrt m)$, so this bound subsumes all previous
results on sublinear clique approximation.
  As a special case of interest, consider minor-closed families of graphs,
which have constant arboricity. Our result implies that for any minor-closed
family of graphs, there is a $(1\pm\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for $n_k$
that has running time $O^*(\frac{n}{n_k})$. Such a bound was not known even for
the special (classic) case of triangle counting in planar graphs.

confirm that the Fe RRC is the most prominent at the western part of the SNR

order parameter of the oscillator configuration. The order parameter is the
arithmetic mean of the configuration of complex oscillator phases, multiplied
by some constant complex coupling factor. In the generalized model we consider,
the order parameter is allowed to be any complex linear combination of the
complex oscillator phases, so the oscillators are no longer necessarily
weighted identically in the order parameter. This asymmetric version of the K-S
model exhibits a much richer variety of steady-state dynamical behavior than
the classic symmetric version; in addition to stable synchronized states, the
system may possess multiple stable (N-1,1) states, in which all but one of the
oscillators are in sync, as well as multiple families of neutrally stable
asynchronous states or closed orbits, in which no two oscillators are in sync.
We present an exhaustive description of the possible steady state dynamical
behaviors; our classification depends on the complex coefficients that
determine the order parameter. We use techniques from group theory and
hyperbolic geometry to reduce the dynamic analysis to a 2D flow on the unit
disc, which has geometric significance relative to the hyperbolic metric. The
geometric-analytic techniques we develop can in turn be applied to study even
more general versions of Kuramoto oscillator networks.

re-engineering of the systems can create new errors and is not always possible

methods to correct errors without damaging existing skills. We formulated the
technical requirements to the 'ideal' correctors. Such correctors include
binary classifiers, which separate the situations with high risk of errors from
the situations where the AI systems work properly. Surprisingly, for

Fisher discriminant can separate the situations with errors from correctly
solved tasks even for exponentially large samples. The paper presents the
probabilistic basis for fast non-destructive correction of AI systems. A series

extract the system matrices easily compared to that of the original non-linear
system. The under-determined system is closed with a set of model-dependent
non-linear constraints upon which the model reduction is finally performed. The
methodology is validated on the subsonic and transonic inviscid flow past the
NACA0012 and the RAE2822 airfoils. We further demonstrate the utility of the
approach by applying it to two common problems in aerospace design namely,
derivative-free global optimization and parametric uncertainty quantification
with Monte Carlo sampling. Overall, the methodology is shown to achieve
accuracy upto 5\% and computational speed-up of 2-3 orders of magnitude as that
of the full-order model. Comparison against another non-intrusive model
reduction method revealed that the proposed approach is more robust, accurate
and retains the consistency between the state variables.

researchers and public managers. In Brazil, homicide is the third leading cause
of death in the general population and the first in the 15-39 age group. In
South America, Brazil has the third highest homicide mortality, behind
Venezuela and Colombia. To measure the impacts of violence it is important to
assess health systems and criminal justice, as well as other areas. In this
paper, we analyze the spatial distribution of homicide mortality in the state
of Goias, Center-West of Brazil, since the homicide rate increased from 24.5
per 100,000 in 2002 to 42.6 per 100,000 in 2014 in this location. Moreover,
this state had the fifth position of homicides in Brazil in 2014. We considered
socio-demographic variables for the state, performed analysis about correlation
and employed three clustering algorithms: K-means, Density-based and
Hierarchical. The results indicate the homicide rates are higher in cities
neighbors of large urban centers, although these cities have the best
socioeconomic indicators.

that in the generic configuration any not too small and not too large convex

that has attracted significant interest over the past 20 years. However, human
emotional states are quite complex. To appraise such states displayed in
real-world settings, we need expressive emotional descriptors that are capable
of capturing and describing this complexity. The circumplex model of affect,
which is described in terms of valence (i.e., how positive or negative is an
emotion) and arousal (i.e., power of the activation of the emotion), can be
used for this purpose. Recent progress in the emotion recognition domain has
been achieved through the development of deep neural architectures and the
availability of very large training databases. To this end, Aff-Wild has been
the first large-scale ""in-the-wild"" database, containing around 1,200,000
frames. In this paper, we build upon this database, extending it with 260 more
subjects and 1,413,000 new video frames. We call the union of Aff-Wild with the
additional data, Aff-Wild2. The videos are downloaded from Youtube and have
large variations in pose, age, illumination conditions, ethnicity and
profession. Both database-specific as well as cross-database experiments are
performed in this paper, by utilizing the Aff-Wild2, along with the RECOLA
database. The developed deep neural architectures are based on the joint
training of state-of-the-art convolutional and recurrent neural networks with
attention mechanism; thus exploiting both the invariant properties of
convolutional features, while modeling temporal dynamics that arise in human
behaviour via the recurrent layers. The obtained results show premise for
utilization of the extended Aff-Wild, as well as of the developed deep neural
architectures for visual analysis of human behaviour in terms of continuous
emotion dimensions.

of affect analysis. Various approaches have been proposed for: i) discrete
emotion recognition in terms of the primary facial expressions; ii) emotion
analysis in terms of facial Action Units (AUs), assuming a fixed expression
intensity; iii) dimensional emotion analysis, in terms of valence and arousal
(VA). These approaches can only be effective, if they are developed using
large, appropriately annotated databases, showing behaviors of people
in-the-wild, i.e., in uncontrolled environments. Aff-Wild has been the first,
large-scale, in-the-wild database (including around 1,200,000 frames of 300
videos), annotated in terms of VA. In the vast majority of existing emotion
databases, their annotation is limited to either primary expressions, or
valence-arousal, or action units. In this paper, we first annotate a part
(around $234,000$ frames) of the Aff-Wild database in terms of $8$ AUs and
another part (around $288,000$ frames) in terms of the $7$ basic emotion
categories, so that parts of this database are annotated in terms of VA, as
well as AUs, or primary expressions. Then, we set up and tackle multi-task
learning for emotion recognition, as well as for facial image generation.
Multi-task learning is performed using: i) a deep neural network with shared
hidden layers, which learns emotional attributes by exploiting their
inter-dependencies; ii) a discriminator of a generative adversarial network
(GAN). On the other hand, image generation is implemented through the generator
of the GAN. For these two tasks, we carefully design loss functions that fit
the examined set-up. Experiments are presented which illustrate the good
performance of the proposed approach when applied to the new annotated parts of
the Aff-Wild database.

state descriptors and a neutral 2D image of a person to whom the corresponding
affect will be synthesized. Given this target pair, a set of 3D facial meshes
is selected, which is used to build a blendshape model and generate the new
facial affect. To synthesize the affect on the 2D neutral image, 3DMM fitting
is performed and the reconstructed face is deformed to generate the target
facial expressions. Last, the new face is rendered into the original image.
Both qualitative and quantitative experimental studies illustrate the
generation of realistic images, when the neutral image is sampled from a
variety of well known databases, such as the Aff-Wild, AFEW, Multi-PIE,
AFEW-VA, BU-3DFE, Bosphorus.

operate on locally connected and weighted regions of the input, we also extend
graph normalization from one-dimensional node sequence to two-dimensional node

requiring any kinds of cost depending on prior knowledge of the graph

the Cartesian STF tensors and Blanchet-Damour multipole formalism. We separate
the self-field effects of the bodies from the external gravitational
environment and construct the effective background spacetime manifold by making
use of the asymptotic matching technique. We make worldline of the center of
mass of each body identical with that of the origin of the body-adapted local
coordinates by the appropriate choice of the dipole moments. The covariant
equations of motion are obtained by applying the Einstein principle of
equivalence and the Fermi-Walker law of transportation of the linear momentum

Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon covariant equations of motion beyond the spin-dipole
particle approximation by accounting for the entire infinite set of the
internal multipoles of the bodies which are gravitationally coupled with the
curvature tensor of the background manifold and its covariant derivatives. The
results of our study can be used for much more accurate prediction of orbital
dynamics of extended bodies in inspiraling binary systems and construction of
templates of gravitational waves at the merger stage when the strong
gravitational interaction between the higher-order multipoles of the bodies
play a dominant role. The covariant theory of the post-Newtonian equations of

protein sensors that allow biologists to visualize using an optical microscope
whether specific proteins are activated due to the presence nearby of small
drug-like signaling molecules, ligands or analytes. Often such probes comprise
a donor fluorescent protein attached to a ligand binding domain, a sensor or
reporter domain attached to the acceptor fluorescent protein, with these ligand
binding and sensor domains connected by a protein linker. Various choices of
linker type are possible ranging from highly flexible proteins to hinge-like
proteins. It is also possible to select donor and acceptor pairs according to
their corresponding F\""oster radius, or even to mutate binding and sensor

states. The focus of the present work is the exploration through simulation of
the impact of such choices on sensor performance.

basic equations of its dynamics and to finding canonical solutions, or
particular equilibria, after specifying the notion of maturity introduced in
