describe nonequatorial circular orbits of a spinning particle in the
Schwarzschild-de Sitter background are studied, and the role of the
cosmological constant is emphasized. It is shown that generally speaking a
highly relativistic velocity of the particle is a necessary condition of motion
along this type of orbits, with an exception of orbits locating close to the
position of the static equilibrium, where low velocities are possible as well.
Depending on the correlation between the spin orientation of the particle and
its orbital velocity some of the possible nonequatorial circular orbits exist
due to the repulsive action on the particle caused by the spin-gravity coupling
and the others are caused by the attractive action.Here values of the energy of
the particle on the corresponding orbits are also analyzed.

employing a one-shot learning technique. Given an image of a query logo, our
model searches for it within a given target image and predicts the possible

model consists of a conditional branch and a segmentation branch. The former
gives a conditional latent representation of the given query logo which is
combined with feature maps of the segmentation branch at multiple scales in

it be present. Feature matching between the latent query representation and
multi-scale feature maps of segmentation branch using simple concatenation

powerful exponential tensor renormalization group (XTRG) method on cylinders

operator approach directly in 2D. The observed thermal properties of the TLH

confirmed by a more careful inspection of the experimental data. We propose
that in the intermediate regime between the low-temperature scale $T_l$ and the
higher one $T_h$, the gapped ""roton-like"" excitations are activated with a
strong chiral component and a large contribution to thermal entropies, which
suppress the incipient 120$^\circ$ order that emerges for temperatures below

efficient hashing methods have been developed to facilitate memory and time
efficient retrieval of similar images. However, none of the existing works uses
hashing to address texture image retrieval mostly because of the lack of
sufficiently large texture image databases. Our work addresses this problem by
developing a novel deep learning architecture that generates binary hash codes
for input texture images. For this, we first pre-train a Texture Synthesis
Network (TSN) which takes a texture patch as input and outputs an enlarged view
of the texture by injecting newer texture content. Thus it signifies that the
TSN encodes the learnt texture specific information in its intermediate layers.
In the next stage, a second network gathers the multi-scale feature
representations from the TSN's intermediate layers using channel-wise
attention, combines them in a progressive manner to a dense continuous
representation which is finally converted into a binary hash code with the help
of individual and pairwise label information. The new enlarged texture patches
also help in data augmentation to alleviate the problem of insufficient texture
data and are used to train the second stage of the network. Experiments on
three public texture image retrieval datasets indicate the superiority of our
texture synthesis guided hashing approach over current state-of-the-art
methods.

consortium since it prioritizes trust over privacy. One of the popular
platforms for distributed ledger solution, Hyperledger Fabric, requires a
transaction to be endorsed or approved by a group of special members known as
endorsers before undergoing validation. To endorse a transaction, an endorser
mentions its identity along with the signature so that it can be verified
later. However, for certain transactions, difference in opinion may exist among
endorsers. Disclosing the identity of an endorser may lead to conflict within
the consortium. In such cases, an endorsement policy which not only allows an
endorser to support a transaction discreetly, but at the same time takes into
account the decision of the majority is preferred. Thus we propose an Anonymous
Endorsement System which uses a threshold endorsement policy in order to
address the issue. All these factors motivated us to design a new ring
signature scheme, called Fabric' Constant-Sized Linkable Ring Signature
(FCsLRS) with Transaction-Oriented linkability for hiding identity of the
endorsers. We have implemented the signature scheme in Golang and analyzed its
security and performance by varying the RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) modulus
size. Feasibility of implementation is supported by experimental analysis.
Signature and tag generation time is quite fast and remains constant
irrespective of change in message length or endorsement set size for a given
RSA modulus value, assuming all the endorsers generates their signature in
parallel. Lastly, we also discuss the integration of the scheme on v1.2
Hyperledger Fabric.

the reddening $E(B-V)$. We consider variations of the polarisation degree $P$,
position angle $\theta$, and polarisation efficiency $P/E(B-V)$ with Galactic
coordinates, distance $R$, and dereddened colour. $P$ shows a maximum at the
Gould Belt mid-plane. $P/R$ drops in the Local Bubble by several times defining
a boundary of the Bubble at $P=0.1$ per cent. All the data sources of the
reddening, except Lallement et al., show a drop of $P/E(B-V)$ in the Bubble. A
significant number of stars with a too high $P/E(B-V)$, where the reddening is
taken from Arenou et al., Drimmel et al. or Lallement et al., either reject the
Serkowski's limit $P/E(B-V)<9.3$ per cent per mag or manifest a systematic
underestimation of the reddening by these data sources. The spatial and colour
dependent variations of $P$ and $E(B-V)$ outside the Bubble compensate each
other, resulting in a nearly constant $P/E(B-V)$. A giant envelope of aligned
dust dominates at middle and high latitudes outside the Bubble. The Markkanen's
cloud, the North Polar Spur, and some other filaments are parts of this
envelope.

complexity, caused by more advanced processor designs and the intricate
interaction between user programs, the operating system, and the processor's
microarchitecture. In this report, we summarize our experience about how
performance characteristics of software should be measured when running on a
Linux operating system and a modern processor. In particular, (1) We provide a
general overview about hardware and operating system features that may have a
significant impact on timing and how they interact, (2) we identify sources of
errors that need to be controlled in order to obtain unbiased measurement
results, and (3) we propose a measurement setup for Linux to minimize errors.
Although not the focus of this report, we describe the measurement process
using hardware performance counters, which can faithfully reflect the real
bottlenecks on a given processor. Our experiments confirm that our measurement
setup has a large impact on the results. More surprisingly, however, they also
suggest that the setup can be negligible for certain analysis methods.
Furthermore, we found that our setup maintains significantly better performance
under background load conditions, which means it can be used to improve
software in high-performance applications.

permittivity of macroscopically homogeneous and isotropic systems of
inhomogeneous dielectric particles with different degrees of penetrability. The
theory is based upon our original compact-group approach, complemented by the
Hashin-Shtrikman variational principle. The governing equation is obtained by
summing up the statistical moments for the deviations of the local permittivity
in the system from the desired effective permittivity. The latter is, in
principle, recoverable from the governing equation as a functional of the
constituents' volume concentrations (expressed through statistical averages of
certain products of the particles' characteristic functions) and permittivity
profiles. Under the suggestion that the local permittivity is determined by the
shortest distance from the point of interest to the nearest sphere, a complete
analysis is carried out for hard and fully penetrable spheres with
piecewise-continuous radial permittivities. The results are contrasted with
other authors' analytical theories and simulation data. This comparison
validates our theory and also sheds light on possible computational errors
caused by the use of rectangular lattices to simulate dispersions of spherical

elevation, but the causes of this pattern remain unclear, partly because they
are confounded by coincident variation in alpha- and gamma-diversity. We used
8,795 forest vegetation-plot records from the Czech National Phytosociological
Database to compare the observed patterns of beta diversity to null-model
expectations (beta-deviation) controlling for the effects of alpha- and
gamma-diversity. We tested whether \b{eta}-diversity patterns along a 1,200 m
elevation gradient exclusively depend on the effect of varying species pool
size, or also on the variation of the magnitude of community assembly
mechanisms determining the distribution of species across communities (e.g.,
environmental filtering, dispersal limitation). The null model we used is a
novel extension of an existing null-model designed for presence/absence data
and was specifically designed to disrupt the effect of community assembly
mechanisms, while retaining some key features of observed communities such as
average species richness and species abundance distribution. Analyses were
replicated in ten subregions with comparable elevation ranges. Beta-diversity
declined along the elevation gradient due to a decrease in gamma-diversity,
which was steeper than the decrease in alpha-diversity. This pattern persisted
after controlling for alpha- and gamma-diversity variation, and the results
were robust when different resampling schemes and diversity metrics were used.
We conclude that in temperate forests the pattern of decreasing beta-diversity
with elevation does not exclusively depend on variation in species pool size,
as has been hypothesized, but also on variation in community assembly
mechanisms. The results were consistent across resampling schemes and diversity
measures, thus supporting the use of vegetation plot databases for
understanding...

functions $f:[n]^d \to \{0,1\}$ on the $n$-hypergrid. This is the first $o(d)$
monotonicity tester with query complexity independent of $n$. Motivated by this
independence of $n$, we initiate the study of monotonicity testing of
measurable Boolean functions $f:\mathbb{R}^d \to \{0,1\}$ over the continuous
domain, where the distance is measured with respect to a product distribution
over $\mathbb{R}^d$. We give a $\tilde{O}(d^{5/6})$-query monotonicity tester
for such functions.
  Our main technical result is a domain reduction theorem for monotonicity. For
any function $f:[n]^d \to \{0,1\}$, let $\epsilon_f$ be its distance to
monotonicity. Consider the restriction $\hat{f}$ of the function on a random
$[k]^d$ sub-hypergrid of the original domain. We show that for $k =
\text{poly}(d/\epsilon)$, the expected distance of the restriction is
$\mathbb{E}[\epsilon_{\hat{f}}] = \Omega(\epsilon_f)$. Previously, such a
result was only known for $d=1$ (Berman-Raskhodnikova-Yaroslavtsev, STOC 2014).
Our result for testing Boolean functions over $[n]^d$ then follows by applying
the $d^{5/6}\cdot \text{poly}(1/\epsilon,\log n, \log d)$-query hypergrid
tester of Black-Chakrabarty-Seshadhri (SODA 2018).
  To obtain the result for testing Boolean functions over $\mathbb{R}^d$, we
use standard measure theoretic tools to reduce monotonicity testing of a
measurable function $f$ to monotonicity testing of a discretized version of $f$
over a hypergrid domain $[N]^d$ for large, but finite, $N$ (that may depend on
$f$). The independence of $N$ in the hypergrid tester is crucial to getting the
final tester over $\mathbb{R}^d$.

traditional approach to warping, where one aims to recover individual-specific
registration, we focus on shift registration across the components of a
multivariate functional data vector on a population-wide level. Our proposed
estimates for these shifts are identifiable, enjoy parametric rates of

of the most well-known first-order optimisation scheme in the literature, as it
achieves the worst-case $O(1/k^2)$ optimal convergence rate in terms of
objective function value. However, despite such an optimal theoretical
convergence rate, in practice the (local) oscillatory behaviour of FISTA often
damps its efficiency. Over the past years, various efforts are made in the
literature to improve the practical performance of FISTA, such as monotone
FISTA, restarting FISTA and backtracking strategies. In this paper, we propose
a simple yet effective modification to the original FISTA scheme which has two
advantages: it allows us to 1) prove the convergence of generated sequence; 2)
design a so-called ""lazy-start"" strategy which can up to an order faster than
the original scheme. Moreover, by exploring the properties of FISTA scheme, we
propose novel adaptive and greedy strategies which probes the limit of the

research such as searches for permanent electric dipole moments. One of the
main noise sources of atomic magnetometers comes from the light shift that
depends on the frequency of the pump laser. In this work, we theoretically
study the light shift, taking into account the relaxation due to the optical
pumping and the collision between alkali atoms and between alkali atoms and the
buffer gas. Starting from a full master equation containing both the ground and
excited states, we adiabatically eliminate the excited states and obtain an
effective master equation in the ground-state subspace that shows an intuitive
picture and dramatically accelerates the numerical simulation. Solving this
effective master equation, we find that in the light-narrowing regime, where
the line width is reduced while the coherent precession signal is enhanced, the
frequency-dependence of the light shift is largely reduced, which agrees with
experimental observations in cesium magnetometers. Since this effective master
equation is general and is easily solved, it can be applied to an extensive
parameter regime, and also to study other physical problems in
alkali-metal-vapor magnetometers, such as heading errors.

codes are known, among which most require noiseless, controllable ancillas. We
show here that such ancillas are not needed when the signal Hamiltonian and the
error operators commute; a common limiting type of decoherence in quantum
sensors. We give a semidefinite program for finding optimal ancilla-free
sensing codes in general, as well as closed-form codes for two common sensing
scenarios: qubits undergoing dephasing, and a lossy bosonic mode. Finally, we
analyze the sensitivity enhancement offered by the qubit code under arbitrary
spatial noise correlations, beyond the ideal limit of orthogonal signal and
noise operators.

exhibits a slowly decaying low-luminosity state (with luminosities of
10^(34-35) erg/s). This behaviour is very similar to what has been observed for
another slowly rotating system, GRO J1008-57. For that source, this
low-luminosity state has been explained in terms of accretion from a

monitoring campaign shows that the source is in a quasi-stable low-luminosity
state (with luminosities a few factors lower than previously seen) for at least
one year now. Using our NuSTAR observation in this state, we found pulsations
at the spin period, demonstrating that the X-ray emission is due to accretion
of matter onto the neutron star surface. If the accretion geometry during this
quasi-stable state is the same as during the cold-disk state, then matter
indeed reaches the surface (as predicted) during this latter state. We discuss
our results in the context of the cold-disk accretion model.

semantic similarity of data points. Given the availability of massive training
samples, deep metric learning is known to suffer from slow convergence due to a
large fraction of trivial samples. Therefore, most existing methods generally
resort to sample mining strategies for selecting nontrivial samples to
accelerate convergence and improve performance. In this work, we identify two
critical limitations of the sample mining methods, and provide solutions for
both of them. First, previous mining methods assign one binary score to each
sample, i.e., dropping or keeping it, so they only selects a subset of relevant
samples in a mini-batch. Therefore, we propose a novel sample mining method,
called Online Soft Mining (OSM), which assigns one continuous score to each
sample to make use of all samples in the mini-batch. OSM learns extended
manifolds that preserve useful intraclass variances by focusing on more similar
positives. Second, the existing methods are easily influenced by outliers as
they are generally included in the mined subset. To address this, we introduce
Class-Aware Attention (CAA) that assigns little attention to abnormal data
samples. Furthermore, by combining OSM and CAA, we propose a novel weighted
contrastive loss to learn discriminative embeddings. Extensive experiments on
two fine-grained visual categorisation datasets and two video-based person
re-identification benchmarks show that our method significantly outperforms the

the stoichiometric ratio and the activation free energy of the more abundant

homopolymerization critical concentration of either species. We further analyze
the polymerization behavior for a finite and negative coupling constant and

behavior in resistivity. Using experimentally determined crystal structure, we
perform the first-principles calculations for the electronic structures.
Experimentally suggested random distribution of Al and Ti is not the origin of
the insulating behavior. The Fermi surfaces for nonrandom AlTi2O5 show
cylindrical shapes reflecting a layered structure, which indicates a possible

construct a small context-free grammar generating only $T$. Among existing
grammar compression methods, RePair (recursive paring) [Larsson and Moffat,
1999] is notable for achieving good compression ratios in practice. Although
the original paper already achieved a time-optimal algorithm to compute the
RePair grammar RePair($T$) in expected $O(N)$ time, the study to reduce its
working space is still active so that it is applicable to large-scale data. In
this paper, we propose the first RePair algorithm working in compressed space,
i.e., potentially $o(N)$ space for highly compressible texts. The key idea is
to give a new way to restructure an arbitrary grammar $S$ for $T$ into
RePair($T$) in compressed space and time. Based on the recompression technique,
we propose an algorithm for RePair($T$) in $O(\min(N, nm \log N))$ space and
expected $O(\min(N, nm \log N) m)$ time or $O(\min(N, nm \log N) \log \log N)$
time, where $n$ is the size of $S$ and $m$ is the number of variables in
RePair($T$). We implemented our algorithm running in $O(\min(N, nm \log N) m)$
time and show it can actually run in compressed space. We also present a new
approach to reduce the peak memory usage of existing RePair algorithms
combining with our algorithms, and show that the new approach outperforms, both
in computation time and space, the most space efficient linear-time RePair
implementation to date.

considering all explicit three-body mechanisms of the interacting $\pi\pi N$

accounted for by the Faddeev-type ordering structure of the
Alt-Grassberger-Sandhas equations. The formulation is valid for hadronic
two-point and three-point functions dressed by arbitrary internal mechanisms
provided all associated electromagnetic currents are constructed to satisfy
their respective (generalized) Ward-Takahashi identities. It is shown that
coupling the photon to the Faddeev structure of the underlying hadronic
two-pion production mechanisms results in a natural expansion of the full
two-pion photoproduction current $M_{\pi\pi}^\mu$ in terms of multiple dressed
loops involving two-body subsystem scattering amplitudes of the $\pi\pi N$
system that preserves gauge invariance as a matter of course order by order in
the number of (dressed) loops. A closed-form expression is presented for the
entire gauge-invariant current $M_{\pi\pi}^\mu$ with complete three-body
dynamics. Individually gauge-invariant truncations of the full dynamics most
relevant for practical applications at the no-loop, one-loop, and two-loop
levels are discussed in detail. An approximation scheme to the full two-pion
amplitude for calculational purposes is also presented. It approximates,
systematically, the full amplitude to any desired order of expansion in the
underlying hadronic two-body amplitude. Moreover, it allows for the approximate
incorporation of all neglected higher-order mechanisms in terms of a
phenomenological remainder current. The effect and phenomenological usefulness
of this remainder current is assessed in a tree-level calculation of the

current trade-off between depth and computational cost makes it difficult to
adopt deep neural networks for many industrial applications, especially when

deeper embeddings are needed to discriminate difficult samples (i.e.,
fine-grained discrimination), a large number of samples can be well
discriminated via much shallower embeddings (i.e., coarse-grained
discrimination). In this study, we introduce the simple yet effective concept
of decision gates (d-gate), modules trained to decide whether a sample needs to
be projected into a deeper embedding or if an early prediction can be made at
the d-gate, thus enabling the computation of dynamic representations at
different depths. The proposed d-gate modules can be integrated with any deep
neural network and reduces the average computational cost of the deep neural
networks while maintaining modeling accuracy. The proposed d-gate framework is
examined via different network architectures and datasets, with experimental
results showing that leveraging the proposed d-gate modules led to a ~43%

can handle the cases that existing methods cannot handle: satisfying multiple

could be explained by mass transfer from the more-massive component to the

$O \left(n \log n\ \cdot 2^{O(\log^* n)} \right)$, where $\log^* n$ is the
iterated logarithm of $n$.
  We explain how we can put F\""urer's ideas into practice for multiplying
polynomials over a prime field $\mathbb{Z} / p \mathbb{Z}$, for which $p$ is a
Generalized Fermat prime of the form $p = r^k + 1$ where $k$ is a power of $2$
and $r$ is of machine word size. When $k$ is at least 8, we show that
multiplication inside such a prime field can be efficiently implemented via
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Taking advantage of Cooley-Tukey tensor formula
and the fact that $r$ is a $2k$-th primitive root of unity in $\mathbb{Z} / p
\mathbb{Z}$, we obtain an efficient implementation of FFT over $\mathbb{Z} / p
\mathbb{Z}$. This implementation outperforms comparable implementations either
using other encodings of $\mathbb{Z} / p \mathbb{Z}$ or other ways to perform
multiplication in $\mathbb{Z} / p \mathbb{Z}$.

$O(\sqrt{t})$. This improves upon a result of Ezra and Lovett for this range of

that the partial widths for decay into any open channel channel fluctuate

experimental $s$-wave partial neutron width distributions deviated
substantially from the PTD. Several explanations for this finding have been
proposed within the statistical model, but none has resolved this issue. Here,
we review the application of a realistic resonance-reaction model to $s$-wave
neutron scattering from $^{194}$Pt. Our main conclusion is that the PTD
provides an excellent description of the partial neutron width distribution,
provided that the secular energy dependence of the average neutron width is
correctly described. Within a realistic range of model parameters, there can be
a near-threshold bound or virtual state of the neutron channel that changes
this secular dependence from the usual $\sqrt{E}$ dependence, as proposed by
Weidenm\""uller [1]. In this case, the use of the $\sqrt{E}$ dependence to
analyze the data will lead to apparent deviations from the PTD. We discuss the
limited parameter range where such a near threshold state can have a
significant effect.

cosmic-ray physics accuracy becomes increasingly important in addition to high

accuracy for the arrival direction, energy and position of the shower maximum
with traditional techniques. The combination of antennas and particles
detectors in one array is a straight forward way to push the total accuracy for
high-energy cosmic rays for low additional cost. In particular the combination
of radio and muon detectors will not only enhance the accuracy for the

IBFD wireless, however, is throttled by its key challenge, namely

key to enable IBFD wireless. This paper proposes a real-time non-linear
self-interference cancellation solution based on deep learning. In this
solution, a self-interference channel is modeled by a deep neural network

the DNN of the self-interference channel. Afterwards, the trained DNN is used
to cancel the self-interference at a wireless node. This solution has been
implemented on a USRP SDR testbed and evaluated in real world in multiple
scenarios with various modulations in transmitting information including
numbers, texts as well as images. It results in the performance of 17dB in
digital cancellation, which is very close to the self-interference power and
nearly cancels the self-interference at a SDR node in the testbed. The solution
yields an average of 8.5% bit error rate (BER) over many scenarios and

NLO QCD correction and the EW corrections from the $q\bar{q}$ annihilation and
photon-induced channels to the $W^-W^+H$ production at the $14~ {\rm TeV}$ LHC,
and deal with the subsequent decays of Higgs and $W^{\pm}$ bosons by adopting
the {\sc MadSpin} method. Both the integrated cross section and some kinematic
distributions of $W^{\pm}$, $H$ and their decay products are provided. We find
that the QCD correction enhances the LO differential cross section
significantly, while the EW correction from the $q\bar{q}$ annihilation channel
obviously suppresses the LO differential cross section, especially in the high
energy phase-space region due to the Sudakov effect. The $q\gamma$- and
$\gamma\gamma$-induced relative corrections are positive, and insensitive to
the transverse momenta of $W^{\pm}$, $H$ and their decay products. These
photon-induced corrections compensate the negative $q\bar{q}$-initiated EW
correction, and become the dominant EW contribution as the increment of the
$pp$ colliding energy. The parton shower (PS) effects on the kinematic
distributions are nonnegligible. The PS relative correction to the $b$-jet
transverse momentum distribution can exceed $100\%$ in the high $p_{T, b}$
region. We also investigate the scale and PDF uncertainties, and find that the
theoretical error of the ${\rm QCD}+{\rm EW}+q\gamma+\gamma\gamma$ corrected
integrated cross section mainly comes from the renormalization scale dependence
of the QCD correction.

update the layer-wise weights and activations in parallel. Most notably, we
only use the mapping of the activation function itself, rather than its
derivatives, thus avoiding the gradient vanishing or blow-up issues in gradient
based training methods. So our method is applicable to various non-decreasing
Lipschitz continuous activation functions, which can be saturating and
non-differentiable. LPOM does not require more auxiliary variables than the
layer-wise activations, thus using roughly the same amount of memory as
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) does. We further prove the convergence of
updating the layer-wise weights and activations. Experiments on MNIST and
CIFAR-10 datasets testify to the advantages of LPOM.

shaping the mass function of stars in clusters. The mass functions also show
strong evidence that globular clusters started with a bottom-light initial mass
function. Our simulations show that the currently surviving globular cluster
population has lost about 80% of its mass since the time of formation. If
globular clusters started from a log-normal mass function, we estimate that the
Milky Way contained about 500 globular clusters initially, with a combined mass

$(\nu_{R})^{C}=C\bar{\nu_{R}}^{T}$ for a chiral fermion $\nu_{R}$ (and
similarly for $\nu_{L}$), is a hidden symmetry associated with CP symmetry, and
thus it formally holds independently of the P- and C-violating terms in the CP
invariant Lagrangian and it is in principle applicable to charged leptons and
quarks as well. This hidden symmetry, however, is not supported by a consistent
unitary operator and thus it leads to mathematical (operatorial) ambiguities.
When carefully examined, it also fails as a classical transformation law in a
Lorentz invariant field theory. To distinguish it from the standard charge
conjugation symmetry, we suggest for it the name of pseudo C-symmetry. The
pseudo C-symmetry is effective to identify Majorana neutrinos analogously to
the classical Majorana condition. The analysis of CP breaking in weak
interactions is performed using the conventional CP transformation, which is
defined independently of the pseudo C-transformation, in the seesaw model after
mass diagonalization. A way to ensure an operatorially consistent formulation
of C-conjugation is to formulate the seesaw scheme by invoking a relativistic

clocks) coupled to a bad cavity and pumped incoherently by a Raman laser. Our
main result is the nonequilibrium phase diagram for this experimental setup in
terms of two parameters - detuning between the clocks and the repump rate.
There are three main phases - trivial steady state (Phase I), where all atoms
are maximally pumped, nontrivial steady state corresponding to monochromatic
superradiance (Phase II), and amplitude-modulated superradiance (Phase III).
Phases I and II are fixed points of the mean-field dynamics, while in most of
Phase III stable attractors are limit cycles. Equations of motion possess an
axial symmetry and a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry with respect to the interchange
of the two clocks. Either one or both of these symmetries are spontaneously
broken in various phases. The trivial steady state loses stability via a
supercritical Hopf bifurcation bringing about a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-symmetric
limit cycle. The nontrivial steady state goes through a subcritical Hopf
bifurcation responsible for coexistence of monochromatic and
amplitude-modulated superradiance. Using Floquet analysis, we show that the
$\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-symmetric limit cycle eventually becomes unstable and gives
rise to two $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-asymmetric limit cycles via a supercritical
pitchfork bifurcation. Each of the above attractors has its own unique
fingerprint in the power spectrum of the light radiated from the cavity. In
particular, limit cycles in Phase III emit frequency combs - series of
equidistant peaks, where the symmetry of the frequency comb reflects the
symmetry of the underlying limit cycle. For typical experimental parameters,
the spacing between the peaks is several orders of magnitude smaller than the
monochromatic superradiance frequency, making the lasing frequency highly
tunable.

map of a mobile agent's environment while localizing the agent within the map.
Dense SLAM algorithms perform reconstruction and localization at pixel
granularity. These algorithms require a lot of computational power, which has
hindered their use on low-power resource-constrained devices.
  Approximate computing can be used to speed up SLAM implementations as long as
the approximations do not prevent the agent from navigating correctly through
the environment. Previous studies of approximation in SLAM have assumed that
the entire trajectory of the agent is known before the agent starts, and they
have focused on offline controllers that set approximation knobs at the start
of the trajectory. In practice, the trajectory is not known ahead of time, and
allowing knob settings to change dynamically opens up more opportunities for
reducing computation time and energy.
  We describe SLAMBooster, an application-aware, online control system for
dense SLAM that adaptively controls approximation knobs during the motion of
the agent. SLAMBooster is based on a control technique called
proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller but our experiments showed
this application-agnostic controller led to an unacceptable reduction in
localization accuracy. To address this problem, SLAMBooster also exploits
domain knowledge for controlling approximation by performing smooth surface
detection and pose correction.
  We implemented SLAMBooster in the open-source SLAMBench framework and
evaluated it on several trajectories. Our experiments show that on the average,
SLAMBooster reduces the computation time by 72% and energy consumption by 35%
on an embedded platform, while maintaining the accuracy of localization within
reasonable bounds. These improvements make it feasible to deploy SLAM on a
wider range of devices.

at a position of a tested object, a large amplitude wave emerges. For the
purpose, we consider a model called a spatial nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation
describing the spatial propagation of a slowly varying envelope of a signal.
Such a model has an exact solution known as (spatial) Soliton on a Finite
Background (SFB) that is a nonlinear extension of Benjamin-Feir instability.
This spatial-SFB is characterized by wave focusing leading to almost
time-periodic extreme waves that appear in between phase singularities.
Although phase singularities and wave focusing have been subject to a number of
studies, this spatial-SFB written in the field variables has many interesting
properties among which are the existence of many critical values related to the
modulation length of the monochromatic signal in the far fields. These
properties will be used in choosing parameters for designing experiments on
extreme wave generation. In doing so, a quantity called maximum temporal
amplitude (MTA) is used. This quantity measures at each location the maximum
over time of the wave elevation. For a given modulation length of SFB and
desired maximum amplitude at a position in a towing tank, the MTA readily shows
the maximum signal that is required at the wavemaker and the amplitude
amplification factor of the requested signal. Some examples of such a
generation in realistic laboratory variables will be displayed.

unsupervised manner on color and depth information independently with
challenging video sequences. During testing, the trained GAN generates
backgrounds similar to that in the test sample. The generated background

inclusions are disks of the same radii, and the emitter is of dipole type and
located in the narrow region between two inclusions. We derive quantitatively
precise estimates of the field enhancement in the narrow region. The estimates
reveal that the field is enhanced by a factor of $\epsilon^{-1/2}$ in most
area, where $\epsilon$ is the distance between two inclusions. This factor is
the same as that of gradient blow-up when there is a smooth back-ground field,

base network on a source dataset, and then transferring the learned features
(the network's weights) to a second network to be trained on a target dataset.
This idea has been shown to improve deep neural network's generalization
capabilities in many computer vision tasks such as image recognition and object
localization. Apart from these applications, deep Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) have also recently gained popularity in the Time Series Classification
(TSC) community. However, unlike for image recognition problems, transfer
learning techniques have not yet been investigated thoroughly for the TSC task.
This is surprising as the accuracy of deep learning models for TSC could
potentially be improved if the model is fine-tuned from a pre-trained neural
network instead of training it from scratch. In this paper, we fill this gap by
investigating how to transfer deep CNNs for the TSC task. To evaluate the
potential of transfer learning, we performed extensive experiments using the
UCR archive which is the largest publicly available TSC benchmark containing 85
datasets. For each dataset in the archive, we pre-trained a model and then
fine-tuned it on the other datasets resulting in 7140 different deep neural
networks. These experiments revealed that transfer learning can improve or
degrade the model's predictions depending on the dataset used for transfer.
Therefore, in an effort to predict the best source dataset for a given target
dataset, we propose a new method relying on Dynamic Time Warping to measure
inter-datasets similarities. We describe how our method can guide the transfer
to choose the best source dataset leading to an improvement in accuracy on 71

directionality of the acquired data, and allows for its exploitation by
computational algorithms. In this regard, we propose a set of mathematical
models to represent 3D-US data, inspired by the physics of ultrasound imaging.
We compare different models of Computational Sonography to classical scalar

being oriented along or orthogonal to the corrugation trenches, or
perpendicular to the substrate. Using self-consistent field theory, we
investigate the influence of substrate roughness and surface preference on the
phase transition between the three orientations. When the substrate preference,
$u$, towards one of components is small, increasing the substrate roughness
induces a phase transition from parallel to perpendicular cylindrical phase.
However, when $u$ is large, the parallel orientation is more stable than the
perpendicular one. Within this parallel phase, increasing the substrate
roughness leads to a transition of cylinder orientation changing from being
orthogonal to parallel to the trench long axis. Increasing the substrate
preference leads to an opposite transition from parallel to orthogonal to the
trenches. Furthermore, we predict that the perpendicular cylinder phase is
easier to be obtained when the unidirectional corrugation is along the longer
unit vector of the hexagonal packing than when it is along the shorter unit
vector. Our results qualitatively agree with previous experiments, and
contribute towards applications of the cylinder-forming block copolymer in

canonical quantization, such as Klein-Gordon and Dirac theories, ultimately led
theoretical physicists to turn on quantum field theory to model elementary
particle physics. The aim of the present work is to pursue a method alternative
to canonical quantization that avoids these dfficulties. In order to guarantee
this result, the present approach is constrained to be developed deductively
from physical principles. The physical principles assumed for a free particle
consist of the symmetry properties of the particle with respect to the
Poincar\'e group and of the transformation properties of the position
observable, expressed by means of a suitably conceived notion of quantum
transformation. In so doing, the effectiveness of group theoretical methods is
exploited. Our work has pointed out the necessity of new classes of irreducible
representations of the Poincar\'e group the theory can be based on. For spin 0
particle, four inequivalent theories are completely determined, that differ
from Klein-Gordon theory for the physical interpretation but also for the
mathematical structures. In particular, two of these theories requires
irreducible representations in the new classes. The present lack of the
explicit transformation properties of position with respect to boosts forbids
the complete determination of non zero spin particle theories. A particular
form of these transformation properties was in past adopted by Jordan and
Mukunda. We check its consistency within the present approach; it is found that
for spin 1/2 particles there is only one consistent theory; it is unitarily
related to Dirac theory, but, once again, it requires the new classes of
irreducible representations.

manifold corresponds simultaneously to two systems in a (3+1) dimensional
Minkowski spacetime: a zero-temperature theory with two compactified spatial
dimensions and a finite-temperature theory with one compactified spatial
dimension. Using numerical lattice simulations we show that the model exhibits
two phase transitions related to the breaking of center symmetries along the
compactified directions. We find that at zero temperature the transition lines
cross each other and form the Greek letter $\gamma$ in the phase space
parametrized by the lengths of two compactified spatial dimensions. There are
four different phases. We also demonstrate that the compactification of only
one spatial dimension enhances the confinement property and, consequently,
increases the critical deconfinement temperature.

lot of attention from the research community, as it is demonstrated to be

In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised representation learning framework
called neighbor-encoder, in which domain knowledge can be easily incorporated
into the learning process without modifying the general encoder-decoder
architecture of the classic autoencoder.In contrast to autoencoder, which
reconstructs the input data itself, neighbor-encoder reconstructs the input
data's neighbors. As the proposed representation learning problem is
essentially a neighbor reconstruction problem, domain knowledge can be easily
incorporated in the form of an appropriate definition of similarity between
objects. Based on that observation, our framework can leverage any
off-the-shelf similarity search algorithms or side information to find the
neighbor of an input object. Applications of other algorithms (e.g.,
association rule mining) in our framework are also possible, given that the
appropriate definition of neighbor can vary in different contexts. We have
demonstrated the effectiveness of our framework in many diverse domains,
including images, text, and time series, and for various data mining tasks
including classification, clustering, and visualization. Experimental results
show that neighbor-encoder not only outperforms autoencoder in most of the
scenarios we consider, but also achieves the state-of-the-art performance on

Lundeen et al. reported the direct measurement of the quantum wavefunction via
weak measurements, which gives the wavefunction a clearly operational
definition [Nature 474, 188 (2011)]. The weak measurement method requires
sequential measurements of conjugate observables position and momentum with the
position measurement is weak enough. Surprisingly, the recent research by
Vallone and Dequal shows that performing sequential strong measurements
realizes the same target, in which case no approximation has to be made
compared to the case of weak measurements[Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 040502 (2016)].
Here we experimentally report the direct measurement of the two-dimensional
transverse wavefunction of photons via strong measurements for the first time,
which implies that an accurate and clear operational definition can be given to
wavefunction. We have measured the Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian of l = 1
spatial wavefunctions of photons with R-square are 0.97 and 0.93 respectively.
As a potentially important application, we show that the direct measurement of
two-dimensional wavefunction provides an alternative way to realize digital
holography of three-dimensional objects. The results presented here will not
only deepen our understanding of abstract wavefunction but also have
significant applications in quantum information processing and quantum imaging.

we report on a new strategy in incoherent holographic imaging of metasurfaces,
in which unprecedented spatial resolution and light sensitivity are achieved by
taking full advantage of the polarization selective control of light through
the geometric (Pancharatnam-Berry) phase. The measurement is carried out in an
inherently stable common-path setup composed of a standard optical microscope
and an add-on imaging module. Phase information is acquired from the mutual
coherence function attainable in records created in broadband spatially
incoherent light by the self-interference of scattered and leakage light coming
from the metasurface. In calibration measurements, the phase was mapped with
the precision and spatial background noise better than 0.01 rad and 0.05 rad,
respectively. The imaging excels at the high spatial resolution that was
demonstrated experimentally by the precise amplitude and phase restoration of
vortex metalenses and a metasurface grating with 833 lines/mm. Thanks to
superior light sensitivity of the method, we demonstrated, for the first time
to our knowledge, the widefield measurement of the phase altered by a single
nanoantenna, while maintaining the precision well below 0.15 rad.

in the series of LAMOST quasar survey which has released spectra for totally
~43,000 quasars hitherto. There are 24,772 independently discovered quasars,
17,128 of which are newly discovered. In addition to the great supplement to

(overlapped with SDSS) for investigating the quasar spectral variability and
discovering unusual quasars, including changing-look quasars, with ongoing and

to explore the asteroseismic potential of CHEOPS time-series. Following the

mission that aims to measure gravitational waves in the millihertz range. Laser
frequency noise enters the interferometric measurements and dominates the
expected gravitational signals by many orders of magnitude. Time-delay
interferometry (TDI) is a technique that reduces this laser noise by
synthesizing virtual equal-arm interferometric measurements. Laboratory
experiments and numerical simulations have confirmed that this reduction is
sufficient to meet the scientific goals of the mission in proof-of-concept
setups. In this paper, we show that the on-board antialiasing filters play an
important role in TDI's performance when the flexing of the constellation is
accounted for. This coupling was neglected in previous studies. To reach an
optimal reduction level, filters with vanishing group delays must be used on
board or synthesized off-line. We propose a theoretical model of the residual
laser noise including this flexing-filtering coupling. We also use two
independent simulators to produce realistic measurement signals and compute the
corresponding TDI Michelson variables. We show that our theoretical model
agrees with the simulated data with exquisite precision. Using these two
complementary approaches, we confirm TDI's ability to reduce laser frequency

populations in Galactic globular clusters^{1,2}, a number of intermediate-age
star clusters exhibit a significant colour spread at the main sequence turn-off
(MSTO)^{3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}. A sequential evolution of multiple generations of
stars formed over 100-200 million years is a natural explanation of this colour
spread^{12}. Another approach to explain this feature is to introduce the
effect of stellar rotation^{13}. However, its effectiveness has not yet been
proven due to the lack of direct measurements of rotational velocities. Here we
report the distribution of projected rotational velocities (V sin i) of stars
in the Galactic open cluster M11, measured through a Fourier transform
analysis. Cluster members display a broad V sin i distribution, and fast
rotators including Be stars have redder colours than slow rotators. Monte Carlo
simulations infer that cluster members have highly aligned spin axes and a
broad distribution of equatorial velocities biased towards high velocities. Our
findings demonstrate how stellar rotation affects the colours of cluster
members, suggesting that the colour spread observed in populous clusters can be
understood in the context of stellar evolution even without introducing
multiple stellar populations.

tether-cutting (TC) reconnection signatures, i.e., flux convergence and
cancellation, bidirectional jets, as well as topology change of hot loops, were
clearly observed below the pre-eruption filament. As TC reconnection progressed
between the sheared arcades that enveloped the filament, a channel-like
magnetic flux rope (MFR) arose in multi-wavelength AIA passbands wrapping
around the main axis of the filament. With the subsequent ascent of the newborn
MFR, the filament surprisingly split into three branches. After a 7-hour slow
rise phase, the high-lying branch containing by the MFR abruptly accelerated
causing a two-ribbon flare; while the two low-lying branches remained stable
forming a partial eruption. Complemented by kinematic analysis and decay index
calculation, we conclude that TC reconnection played a key role in building up
the eruptive MFR and triggering its slow rise. The onset of the torus
instability may have led the high-lying branch into the standard eruption
scenario in the fashion of a catastrophe.

during their decay by analysing its extension and horizontal velocity around
eight spots using SDO/HMI Doppler maps. By assuming a radially symmetrical flow
field, the applied analysis method determines the radial dependence of the
azimuthally averaged flow field. For comparison, we studied the flow in
supergranules using the same technique. All investigated, fully fledged
sunspots are surrounded by a flow field whose horizontal velocity profile
decreases continuously from 881 m s$^{-1}$ at 1.1 Mm off the spot boundary,
down to 199 m s$^{-1}$ at a mean distance of 11.9 Mm to that boundary. Once the
penumbra is fully dissolved, however, the velocity profile of the flow changes:
The horizontal velocity increases with increasing distance to the spot boundary
until a maximum value of about 398 m s$^{-1}$ is reached. Then, the horizontal
velocity decreases for farther distances to the spot boundary. In
supergranules, the horizontal velocity increases with increasing distance to
their centre up to a mean maximum velocity of 355 m s$^{-1}$. For larger
distances, the horizontal velocity decreases. We thus find that the velocity
profile of naked sunspots resembles that of supergranular flows. The evolution
of the flow field around individual sunspots is influenced by the way the
sunspot decays and by the interplay with the surrounding flow areas.
Observations of the flow around eight decaying sunspots suggest that as long as
penumbrae are present, sunspots with their moat cell are embedded in network
cells. The disappearance of the penumbra (and consequently the moat flow) and
the competing surrounding supergranular cells, both have a significant role in
the evolution of the flow field: The moat cell transforms into a supergranule,
which hosts the remaining naked spot.

  https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9113442",,,,"cs.SD cs.LG eess.AS stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a voice conversion (VC) method using sequence-to-sequence
(seq2seq or S2S) learning, which flexibly converts not only the voice
characteristics but also the pitch contour and duration of input speech. The
proposed method, called ConvS2S-VC, has three key features. First, it uses a
model with a fully convolutional architecture. This is particularly
advantageous in that it is suitable for parallel computations using GPUs. It is
also beneficial since it enables effective normalization techniques such as
batch normalization to be used for all the hidden layers in the networks.
Second, it achieves many-to-many conversion by simultaneously learning mappings
among multiple speakers using only a single model instead of separately
learning mappings between each speaker pair using a different model. This
enables the model to fully utilize available training data collected from
multiple speakers by capturing common latent features that can be shared across
different speakers. Owing to this structure, our model works reasonably well
even without source speaker information, thus making it able to handle
any-to-many conversion tasks. Third, we introduce a mechanism, called the
conditional batch normalization that switches batch normalization layers in
accordance with the target speaker. This particular mechanism has been found to

gradient blow-up (GBU), loss of boundary conditions (LBC), recovery of boundary
conditions and eventual regularization, and in their mutual connections.
  In any space dimension, we establish the sharp minimal rate of GBU. Only
partial results were previously known except in one space dimension. We also
obtain the corresponding minimal regularization rate.
  In one space dimension, under suitable conditions on the initial data, we
give a quite detailed description of the behavior of solutions for all $t>0$.
In particular, we show that nonminimal GBU solutions immediately lose the
boundary conditions after the blow-up time and are immediately regularized
after recovering the boundary data. Moreover, both GBU and regularization occur
with the minimal rates, while loss and recovery of boundary data occur with
linear rate. We describe further the intermediate singular life of those
solutions in the time interval between GBU and regularization.
  We also study minimal GBU solutions, for which GBU occurs {\it without} LBC:
those solutions are immediately regularized, but their GBU and regularization
rates are more singular.
  Most of our one-dimensional results crucially depend on zero-number
arguments, which do not seem to have been used so far in the context of
viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations.

infinity while fixing the temperature in a non-perturbative setup, has various
advantages: the algorithm is sign problem free, fast, and accumulates high
statistics for correlation functions. Even though the measurement of temporal
correlators requires the introduction of a binning in time direction, this
discretization can be chosen to be by orders finer compared to discrete
computations. For different spatial volumes, temporal correlators are measured
at zero spatial momentum for a variety of mesonic operators. They are fitted to
extract the pole masses and corresponding particles as a function of the

deformation modes of individual rough surfaces and also statistical deformation
regimes, which involve averaging over a big number of roughness realizations.
Two regimes of contact area growth were identified: the Hertzian regime at
light loads at the scale of a single asperity, and the linear regime at higher
loads involving multiple contacting asperities. The transition between the
regimes occurs at the load which depends on the second and the fourth spectral
moments. It is shown that at light indentation the radius of circumference
delimiting the contact area is always considerably larger than Hertzian contact
radius. Therefore, it suggests that there is no scale separation in contact
problems at light loads. In particular, the geometrical shape cannot be
considered separately from the surface roughness at least for approaching
greater than one standard roughness deviation.

methods of absorption and polarized fluorescent spectroscopy. Measurements were
performed in aqueous bufferes solutions (pH 6.9) of low ionic strength (2 mM
Na+) in a wide range of molar phosphate-to-dye ratios (P/D). Absorption and
fluorescence characteristics of complexes formed between the dye and
biopolymers were determined. Binding of MePheo-a to four-stranded poly(G) is
shown to be accompanied by the most significant spectral transformations:
hypochromism of dye absorption,large batochromic shift of Soret absorption band
(~26 nm) and fluorescence band (~9 nm) maxima, 48-fold enhancement of the dye
emission intensity. In contrast, its binding to the double-stranded
polynucleotides and native DNA induces only small shifts of absorption and
fluorescence bands, as well as no more than 4-fold rise of fluorescence
intensity. Substantial spectral changes and high value of fluorescence
polarization degree (0.26) observed upon binding of MePheo-a to quadruplex
poly(G) allow us to suggest the intercalation of the dye chromophore between
guanine tetrads. At the same time, small spectral changed and insignificant
increase of MePheo-a fluorescence polarization degree (0.12) upon binding of
the dye to double-stranded biopolymers point to another binding type.
Incorporation of MePheo-a to a helix groove is supposed to occur, presumably in
the dimeric form. Substantial enhancement of MePheo-a emission upon binding to
four-stranded poly(G) allows us to propose this compouns as a new fluorescent

individual heterogeneity in departure and the dependence of arrival time on
covariates. Additionally, our model provides a semiparametric functional form
for modeling capture probabilities. The model is flexible and can be used to
estimate the stopover duration and stopover population size, which are key to
stopover duration analysis. From the modeling perspective, our model allows for
individual heterogeneity in departure due to a continuous intrinsic factor that
varies with time and individual. A stochastic process is considered to model
the change of this intrinsic factor over time. Moreover, our model links
extrinsic factors to capture probabilities and arrival time. Consequently, our
proposed model enables us to draw inference about the impacts of the intrinsic
factor on departure, and extrinsic factors on both capture outcome and arrival
time. Through the use of a semiparametric model for capture probabilities, we
allow the data to suggest the functional relationship between extrinsic factors
and capture probabilities rather than relying on an imposed parametric model.
By using data augmentation, we develop a well customized Markov chain Monte
Carlo algorithm that is free of tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
model through a motivating example of stopover duration analysis for mallards
(Anas platyrhynchos) studied during fall migration in Sweden.

the horizontal velocity of the flow around sunspots over several days during
sunspot decay. SDO/HMI Doppler maps, which allow for the continuous observation
of an active regions, are used. We describe the analysis method used to
retrieve the horizontal velocity of the flow field for different positions on
the solar disc. For that purpose, several large and small scale flow patterns,
like, e.g., differential rotation, the centre-to-limb variation in the
convective blueshift and a residual pattern caused by instrumental effects,
have to be taken into account in order to properly measure the horizontal
velocity of the flow field surrounding the sunspots. We find that the flow
field around sunspots with fully developed penumbra has a decreasing velocity
profile with increasing distances to the sunspot, as already found by other
authors. Most important, the velocity amplitude decreases and the profile
changes as the penumbra dissolves and the sunspots decay. Our findings confirm
the related disappearance of the moat flow with penumbra. Yet, we observe a
remnant outflow after the penumbra disappears, which hints towards the possible
overtaken of the moat flow by a supergranular flow in decaying sunspots.

provides low latency, location awareness, and real-time interactions. At the
same time, millimeter wave (mmWave) communications are able to provide
directional multi-gigabit transmission rates with large available bandwidth.
Based on the user mobile trajectories in a region, several activity hotspots
that users pass by frequently can be obtained. By caching popular content at
the edge nodes near the hotspots, users can download the cached content
directly at a short distance, and the user experience can be significantly
improved. Considering multiple hotspots in a region, how to efficiently
schedule the transmission for the caching at edge nodes becomes a key problem.
In this paper, we focus on the problem of mobility aware transmission
scheduling for caching at edge nodes near hotspots, and utilize multi-hop
relaying and concurrent transmissions to achieve better performance. After
formulating the optimal scheduling problem as a stochastic nonlinear mixed
integer program, we propose a mobility aware caching scheduling scheme, called
MHRC (Multi-Hop Relaying based Caching), where multi-hop D2D paths are
established for edge nodes, and concurrent transmissions are exploited in the
scheduling of caching at edge nodes. Extensive performance evaluation
demonstrates MHRC achieves more than 1x higher expected cached data amount
compared with state-of-the-art schemes.

can be formed via gas-phase reactions during the cold collapse of the natal

formed by the hydrogenation of CO on the surface of dust grains and subsequent
thermal desorption during the protostellar phase. The derived abundance of HCO
in the dust grains is high enough to produce efficiently more complex species

transmission eigenfunctions. The geometric properties of interior transmission
eigenfunctions were first studied in [9]. It is shown in two scenarios that the
interior transmission eigenfunction must be locally vanishing near a corner of
the domain with an interior angle less than $\pi$. We significantly extend and
generalize those results in several aspects. First, we consider the conductive
transmission eigenfunctions which include the interior transmission
eigenfunctions as a special case. The geometric structures established for the
conductive transmission eigenfunctions in this paper include the results in [9]
as a special case. Second, the vanishing property of the conductive
transmission eigenfunctions is established for any corner as long as its
interior angle is not $\pi$ when the conductive transmission eigenfunctions
satisfy certain Herglotz functions approximation properties. That means, as
long as the corner singularity is not degenerate, the vanishing property holds
if the underlying conductive transmission eigenfunctions can be approximated by
a sequence of Herglotz functions under mild approximation rates. Third, the
regularity requirements on the interior transmission eigenfunctions in [9] are
significantly relaxed in the present study for the conductive transmission
eigenfunctions. Finally, as an interesting and practical application of the
obtained geometric results, we establish a unique recovery result for the
inverse problem associated with the transverse electromagnetic scattering by a
single far-field measurement in simultaneously determining a polygonal
conductive obstacle and its surface conductive parameter.

the tax rate is a function of the capital that would have resulted if no tax
had been paid. Whereas up to now these two types of tax processes have been

complex algorithms, where we have to deal with multiple performance issues at

optimizations, by making use of the \emph{channel} interface, as a replacement
of Pregel's message passing and aggregator mechanism, which can better
structure the communication in Pregel algorithms. We demonstrate that it is
convenient to optimize a Pregel program by simply using a proper channel from
the channel library or composing them to deal with multiple performance issues.
We intensively evaluate the approach through many nontrivial examples. By
adopting the channel interface, our system achieves an all-around performance
gain for various graph algorithms. In particular, the composition of different

The same does not hold true for non-competitive systems. In this study we will
measure the dispersion of research performance within and between universities
in the Italian university system, typically non-competitive. We will also
investigate the level of correlation that occurs between performance in
research and its dispersion in universities. The findings may represent a first
benchmark for similar studies in other nations. Furthermore, they lead to
policy indications, questioning the effectiveness of selective funding of
universities based on national research assessment exercises. The field of
observation is composed of all Italian universities active in the hard
sciences. Research performance will be evaluated using a bibliometric approach,
through publications indexed in the Web of Science between 2004 and 2008.

standard transfer entropy estimators in that the invariant measure is estimated
not directly from the data points but from the invariant distribution of the
transfer operator approximated from the data points. For sparse time series and
low embedding dimension, the transfer operator is approximated using a
triangulation of the attractor, whereas for data-rich time series or higher
embedding dimension we use a faster grid approach. We compare the performance
of our methods with existing estimators such as the k nearest neighbors method
and kernel density estimation method, using coupled instances of well known
chaotic systems: coupled logistic maps and a coupled R\""ossler-Lorenz system.
We find that our estimators are robust against moderate levels of noise. For
sparse time series with less than a hundred observations and low embedding
dimension, our triangulation estimator shows improved ability to detect
coupling directionality, relative to standard transfer entropy estimators.

leading methods to detect atomic and molecular species in the atmospheres of
exoplanets. However, it has so far been lacking in a robust method to extract
quantitative constraints on temperature structure and molecular/atomic

framework applicable to high resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS)
that relies upon the cross-correlation between data and models to extract the
planetary spectral signal. We successfully test the framework on simulated data
and show that it can correctly determine Bayesian credibility intervals on
atmospheric temperatures and abundances allowing for a quantitative exploration
of the inherent degeneracies. Furthermore, our new framework permits us to
trivially combine and explore the synergies between HRCCS and low-resolution
spectroscopy (LRS) to provide maximal leverage on the information contained
within each. This framework also allows us to quantitatively assess the impact
of molecular line opacities at high resolution. We apply the framework to VLT
CRIRES K-band spectra of HD 209458 b and HD 189733 b and retrieve abundant
carbon monoxide but sub-solar abundances for water, largely invariant under
different model assumptions. This confirms previous analysis of these datasets,
but is possibly at odds with detections of water at different wavelengths and
spectral resolutions. The framework presented here is the first step towards a
true synergy between space observatories and ground-based hi-resolution
observations.

except when the interpolating coordinates are pressed toward the light-front

representation of vacuum-bubble contributions and causes a spurious divergence
in the spectrum. The light-front limit instead requires the continuum
momentum-space limit of infinite box size. The calculation of the vacuum energy
density is then shown to be independent of the interpolation parameter, which
implies that the light-front limit yields the same spectrum as an equal-time

in discourse parsing. The difficulty stems from the fact that the coherence
relation must be inferred based on the content of the discourse relational
arguments. Therefore, an effective encoding of the relational arguments is of
crucial importance. We here propose a new model for implicit discourse relation
classification, which consists of a classifier, and a sequence-to-sequence
model which is trained to generate a representation of the discourse relational
arguments by trying to predict the relational arguments including a suitable
implicit connective. Training is possible because such implicit connectives
have been annotated as part of the PDTB corpus. Along with a memory network,
our model could generate more refined representations for the task. And on the
now standard 11-way classification, our method outperforms previous state of
the art systems on the PDTB benchmark on multiple settings including cross
validation.

that enlarges the quantum state to a signal detectable with a classical
measurement apparatus. However, at what point in this process is the quantum
state really 'measured'? In order to investigate whether the `measurement'
takes place in the amplification chain, in which a parametric amplifier is
often chosen as the first amplifier, it is proposed to construct a microwave
interferometer that has such an amplifier added to each of its arms. Feeding
the interferometer with single photons, the interference visibility depends on
the gain of the amplifiers and whether a measurement collapse has taken place
during the amplification process. The visibility as given by standard quantum
mechanics is calculated as a function of gain, insertion loss and temperature.
We find a visibility of 1/3 in the limit of large gain without taking into
account losses, which is reduced to 0.26 in case the insertion loss of the
amplifiers is 2.2 dB at a temperature of 50 mK. It is shown that if the wave
function collapses within the interferometer, the measured visibility is
reduced compared to its magnitude predicted by standard quantum mechanics once
this collapse process sets in.

(subgoal graphs-reinforcement learning), to plan rational paths for agents
maneuvering in continuous and uncertain environments. By ""rational"", we mean
(1) efficient path planning to eliminate first-move lags; (2) collision-free
and smooth for agents with kinematic constraints satisfied. SG-RL works in a
two-level manner. At the first level, SG-RL uses a geometric path-planning
method, i.e., Simple Subgoal Graphs (SSG), to efficiently find optimal abstract
paths, also called subgoal sequences. At the second level, SG-RL uses an RL
method, i.e., Least-Squares Policy Iteration (LSPI), to learn near-optimal
motion-planning policies which can generate kinematically feasible and
collision-free trajectories between adjacent subgoals. The first advantage of
the proposed method is that SSG can solve the limitations of sparse reward and
local minima trap for RL agents; thus, LSPI can be used to generate paths in
complex environments. The second advantage is that, when the environment
changes slightly (i.e., unexpected obstacles appearing), SG-RL does not need to
reconstruct subgoal graphs and replan subgoal sequences using SSG, since LSPI
can deal with uncertainties by exploiting its generalization ability to handle
changes in environments. Simulation experiments in representative scenarios
demonstrate that, compared with existing methods, SG-RL can work well on
large-scale maps with relatively low action-switching frequencies and shorter
path lengths, and SG-RL can deal with small changes in environments. We further
demonstrate that the design of reward functions and the types of training
environments are important factors for learning feasible policies.

  Network (SCNN): A New Perspective and Future Directions","Neural Computation | MIT Press Journals (In-Process)",,,,"cs.AI q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Awareness plays a major role in human cognition and adaptive behaviour,
though mechanisms involved remain unknown. Awareness is not an objectively
established fact, therefore, despite extensive research, scientists have not
been able to fully interpret its contribution in multisensory integration and
precise neural firing, hence, questions remain: (1) How the biological neuron
integrates the incoming multisensory signals with respect to different
situations? (2) How are the roles of incoming multisensory signals defined
(selective amplification/attenuation) that help neuron(s) to originate a
precise neural firing complying with the anticipated behavioural-constraint of
the environment? (3) How are the external environment and anticipated behaviour
integrated? Recently, scientists have exploited deep learning to integrate
multimodal cues and capture context-dependent meanings. Yet, these methods
suffer from imprecise behavioural representation. In this research, we
introduce a new theory on the role of awareness and universal context that can
help answering the aforementioned crucial neuroscience questions. Specifically,
we propose a class of spiking conscious neuron in which the output depends on
three functionally distinctive integrated input variables: receptive field
(RF), local contextual field (LCF), and universal contextual field (UCF). The
RF defines the incoming ambiguous sensory signal, LCF defines the modulatory
signal coming from other parts of the brain, and UCF defines the awareness. It
is believed that the conscious neuron inherently contains enough knowledge
about the situation in which the problem is to be solved based on past learning
and reasoning and it defines the precise role of incoming multisensory signals
to originate a precise neural firing (exhibiting switch-like behaviour). It is
shown that the conscious neuron helps modelling a more precise human behaviour.

  2018",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) typically require massive amount of computation
resource in inference tasks for computer vision applications. Quantization can
significantly reduce DNN computation and storage by decreasing the bitwidth of
network encodings. Recent research affirms that carefully selecting the
quantization levels for each layer can preserve the accuracy while pushing the
bitwidth below eight bits. However, without arduous manual effort, this deep
quantization can lead to significant accuracy loss, leaving it in a position of
questionable utility. As such, deep quantization opens a large hyper-parameter
space (bitwidth of the layers), the exploration of which is a major challenge.
We propose a systematic approach to tackle this problem, by automating the
process of discovering the quantization levels through an end-to-end deep
reinforcement learning framework (ReLeQ). We adapt policy optimization methods
to the problem of quantization, and focus on finding the best design decisions
in choosing the state and action spaces, network architecture and training
framework, as well as the tuning of various hyperparamters. We show how ReLeQ
can balance speed and quality, and provide an asymmetric general solution for
quantization of a large variety of deep networks (AlexNet, CIFAR-10, LeNet,
MobileNet-V1, ResNet-20, SVHN, and VGG-11) that virtually preserves the
accuracy (=< 0.3% loss) while minimizing the computation and storage cost. With
these DNNs, ReLeQ enables conventional hardware to achieve 2.2x speedup over
8-bit execution. Similarly, a custom DNN accelerator achieves 2.0x speedup and
energy reduction compared to 8-bit runs. These encouraging results mark ReLeQ
as the initial step towards automating the deep quantization of neural
networks.

have developed a semi-analytical method for the computation of the emitted

signal of any air-shower at any location from the simulation of one single

methods, but with computation times reduced by several orders of magnitude. In
this paper, we present this novel tool, explain its methodology, and discuss
its limitations. Furthermore, we validate the method on a typical event set for
the future GRAND experiment showing that the calculated peak amplitudes are
consistent with the results from ZHAireS simulations with a mean offset of

Value (GDV) that measures, in a non-invasive manner, how well different data

automatic tuning of hyper-parameters, such as the width profile and the total

into the data transformations that self-organize during training: In the case
of multi-layer perceptrons trained with error backpropagation, we find that
classification of highly complex data sets requires a temporal {\em reduction}

initial part of the GDV(L) curve. Even more surprisingly, for a given data set,
the GDV(L) is running through a fixed 'master curve', independently from the

populations of synchrotron emitting particles, arising from two different
acceleration mechanisms: (i) Component-I due to Fermi-I acceleration at the
equatorial portion of the termination shock, with particle spectral index $p_I
\approx 2.2$ above the injection break corresponding to $\gamma_{wind}
\sigma_{wind} \sim 10^5$, peaking in the UV ($\gamma_{wind} \sim 10^2$ is the
bulk Lorentz factor of the wind, $\sigma _{wind} \sim 10^3$ is wind
magnetization); (ii) Component-II due to acceleration at reconnection layers in
the bulk of the turbulent Nebula, with particle index $p_{II} \approx 1.6$. The
model requires relatively slow but highly magnetized wind. For both components
the overall cooling break is in the infra-red at $\sim 0.01$ eV, so that the
Component-I is in the fast cooling regime (cooling frequency below the peak
frequency). In the optical band Component-I produces emission with the cooling
spectral index of $\alpha_o \approx 0.5$, softening towards the edges due to
radiative losses. Above the cooling break, in the optical, UV and X-rays,
Component-I mostly overwhelms Component-II. We hypothesize that acceleration at
large-scale current sheets in the turbulent nebula (Component-II) extends to
the synchrotron burn-off limit of $\epsilon_s \approx 100$ MeV. Thus in our
model acceleration in turbulent reconnection (Component-II) can produce both
hard radio spectra and occasional gamma-ray flares. This model may be
applicable to a broader class of high energy astrophysical objects, like AGNe
and GRB jets, where often radio electrons form a different population from the
high energy electrons.

artificial neural networks are biologically unrealistic and would need to be
replaced by biologically realistic counterparts. Previous biologically
plausible reinforcement learning rules, like AGREL and AuGMEnT, showed
promising results but focused on shallow networks with three layers. Will these
learning rules also generalize to networks with more layers and can they handle
tasks of higher complexity? We demonstrate the learning scheme on classical and
hard image-classification benchmarks, namely MNIST, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, cast
as direct reward tasks, both for fully connected, convolutional and locally
connected architectures. We show that our learning rule - Q-AGREL - performs
comparably to supervised learning via error-backpropagation, with this type of
trial-and-error reinforcement learning requiring only 1.5-2.5 times more
epochs, even when classifying 100 different classes as in CIFAR100. Our results
provide new insights into how deep learning may be implemented in the brain.

With small gravitational potential wells, these galaxies easily lose their
star-forming material in the presence of intense stellar feedback. Here, we
show that the nearby dwarf galaxy, the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), has atomic
hydrogen outflows extending at least 2 kiloparsecs (kpc) from the star-forming
bar of the galaxy. The outflows are cold, $T<400~{\rm K}$, and may have formed
during a period of active star formation $25 - 60$ million years (Myr) ago. The
total mass of atomic gas in the outflow is $\sim 10^7$ solar masses, ${\rm
M_{\odot}}$, or $\sim 3$% of the total atomic gas of the galaxy. The inferred
mass flux in atomic gas alone, $\dot{M}_{HI}\sim 0.2 - 1.0~{\rm

formation rate. We suggest that most of the observed outflow will be stripped

these findings, we perform a theoretical study of locally induced magnetic
order near nonmagnetic impurities in a model relevant for FeSe. We find that
relatively weak repulsive impurities indeed are capable of generating
short-range magnetism, and explain the driving mechanism for the local order by
resonant eg-orbital states. In addition, we investigate the importance of
orbital-selective self-energy effects relevant for Hund's metals, and show how
the structure of the induced magnetization cloud gets modified by orbital
selectivity. Finally, we make concrete connection to STM measurements of
iron-based superconductors by symmetry arguments of the induced magnetic order,
and the basic properties of the Fe Wannier functions relevant for tunneling
spectroscopy.

Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs. Motivated by a problem of communication
security, we focus on planted structures that consist in a tree graph. For
planted line graphs, we establish the following phase diagram. In a low density
region where the average degree $\lambda$ of the initial graph is below some
critical value $\lambda_c=1$, detection and reconstruction go from impossible
to easy as the line length $K$ crosses some critical value $f(\lambda)\ln(n)$,
where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph. In the high density region
$\lambda>\lambda_c$, detection goes from impossible to easy as $K$ goes from
$o(\sqrt{n})$ to $\omega(\sqrt{n})$, and reconstruction remains impossible so
long as $K=o(n)$. For $D$-ary trees of varying depth $h$ and $2\le D\le O(1)$,
we identify a low-density region $\lambda<\lambda_D$, such that the following
holds. There is a threshold $h*=g(D)\ln(\ln(n))$ with the following properties.
Detection goes from feasible to impossible as $h$ crosses $h*$. We also show
that only partial reconstruction is feasible at best for $h\ge h*$. We
conjecture a similar picture to hold for $D$-ary trees as for lines in the
high-density region $\lambda>\lambda_D$, but confirm only the following part of
this picture: Detection is easy for $D$-ary trees of size $\omega(\sqrt{n})$,
while at best only partial reconstruction is feasible for $D$-ary trees of any
size $o(n)$. These results are in contrast with the corresponding picture for
detection and reconstruction of {\em low rank} planted structures, such as
dense subgraphs and block communities: We observe a discrepancy between
detection and reconstruction, the latter being impossible for a wide range of
parameters where detection is easy. This property does not hold for previously

are interested in information flow from the register to the environment, which
we describe using recently introduced multipartite quantum state structures
called Spectrum Broadcast Structures. Working in two specific cases of: i)
two-qubit register and ii) collective decoherence, we identify the regimes
where the environment acquires almost complete information about the register

the finite propagation time of the field disturbances between the qubits.
Finally, we describe quantum state structures which appear due to the presence
of protected spaces.

of them are available online as application programming interfaces (APIs) with

machine learning in the form of back-box attacks on online classifier APIs. We
start with a deep learning based exploratory (inference) attack, which aims to
build a classifier that can provide similar classification results (labels) as
the target classifier. To minimize the difference between the labels returned
by the inferred classifier and the target classifier, we show that the deep
learning based exploratory attack requires a large number of labeled training
data samples. These labels can be collected by calling the online API, but
usually there is some strict rate limitation on the number of allowed API
calls. To mitigate the impact of limited training data, we develop an active
learning approach that first builds a classifier based on a small number of API
calls and uses this classifier to select samples to further collect their
labels. Then, a new classifier is built using more training data samples. This
updating process can be repeated multiple times. We show that this active
learning approach can build an adversarial classifier with a small statistical
difference from the target classifier using only a limited number of training
data samples. We further consider evasion and causative (poisoning) attacks
based on the inferred classifier that is built by the exploratory attack.
Evasion attack determines samples that the target classifier is likely to
misclassify, whereas causative attack provides erroneous training data samples
to reduce the reliability of the re-trained classifier. The success of these
attacks show that adversarial machine learning emerges as a feasible threat in
the realistic case with limited training data.

envelopes that are sufficiently thick to affect significantly their overall
structure. The radii of these stars, in particular, are sensitive to the
details of inefficient, super-adiabatic convection occurring in their outermost
layers. The standard treatment of convection in stellar evolution models, based
on the Mixing-Length Theory (MLT), provides only a very approximate description
of convection in the super-adiabatic regime. Moreover, it contains a free
parameter, alpha_MLT, whose standard calibration is based on the Sun, and is
routinely applied to other stars ignoring the differences in their global
parameters (e.g., effective temperature, gravity, chemical composition) and
previous evolutionary history. In this paper, we present a calibration of
alpha_MLT based on three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics (3D RHD)
simulations of convection. The value of alpha_MLT is adjusted to match the
specific entropy in the deep, adiabatic layers of the convective envelope to
the corresponding value obtained from the 3D RHD simulations, as a function of
the position of the star in the (log g, log T_eff) plane and its chemical
composition. We have constructed a model of the present-day Sun using such
entropy-based calibration. We find that its past luminosity evolution is not
affected by the entropy calibration. The predicted solar radius, however,
exceeds that of the standard model during the past several billion years,
resulting in a lower surface temperature. This illustrative calculation also
demonstrates the viability of the entropy approach for calibrating the radii of
other late-type stars.

processes are examined and cross-compared to assess if the underlying
ecological processes in these systems produce considerable difference in the
structure of the networks. Absence of any significant difference in the
structure of the networks may indicate towards the possibility of a universal
structural pattern in these ecological networks. The underlying graphs of the
networks derived by the ecological processes, namely host-parasite interaction,
plant pollination and seed dispersion are all bipartite graphs and thus several
algebraic structural measures fail to distinguish between the structure of
these networks. In this work we use weighted spectral distribution (WSD) of
normalized graph Laplacian, which have been effectively used earlier to
discriminate graphs with different topologies, to investigate the possibility
of existence of structural dissimilarity in these networks. Graph spectrum is
often considered a signature of the graph and WSD of the graph Laplacian is
shown to be related to the distribution of some small subgraphs in a graph and
hence represent the global structure of a network.We use random projections of
WSD to $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and establish that the structure
of plant pollinator networks is significantly different as compared to
host-parasite and seed dispersal networks. The structures of host parasite
networks and seed dispersal networks are found to be identical. Furthermore, we
use some algebraic structural measures in order to quantify the differences as
well as similarities observed in the structure of the three kinds of networks.
We thus infer that our work suggests an absence of a universal structural
pattern in these three different kinds of networks.

high-order regularized tensor approximation approach on the smooth part of a
composite convex optimization model. The proposed scheme has the advantage of
not needing to assume any prior knowledge of the Lipschitz constants for the
gradient, the Hessian and/or high-order derivatives. This is achieved by tuning
the parameters used in the algorithm \textit{adaptively} in its process of
progression, which has been successfully incorporated in high-order nonconvex
optimization (CartisGouldToint2018,
Birgin-Gardenghi-Martinez-Santos-Toint-2017). In general, we show that the
adaptive high-order method has an iteration bound of $O\left( 1 /
\epsilon^{1/(p+1)} \right)$ if the first $p$-th order derivative information is
used in the approximation, which has the same iteration complexity as in that
of the nonadaptive version in (Baes-2009, Nesterov-2018) where the Lipschitz
constants are assumed to be known and the subproblems are assumed to be solved
exactly. Thus, our results partially address the problem of incorporating
adaptive strategies into the high-order {\it accelerated} methods raised by
Nesterov in (Nesterov-2018), although our strategies cannot assure the
convexity of the auxiliary problem and such adaptive strategies are already

apply it to a deep-neural-network (DNN) for speech enhancement in the modified

short-time Fourier transform (STFT)-domain is a typical speech enhancement
method. To recover the target signal precisely, DNN-based short-time frequency
transforms have recently been investigated and used instead of the STFT.
However, since such a fixed-resolution short-time frequency transform method
has a T-F resolution problem based on the uncertainty principle, not only the
short-time frequency transform but also the length of the windowing function
should be optimized. To overcome this problem, we incorporate AWS into the
speech enhancement procedure, and the windowing function of each time-frame is
manipulated using a DNN depending on the input signal. We confirmed that the
proposed method achieved a higher signal-to-distortion ratio than conventional
speech enhancement methods in fixed-resolution frequency domains.

computational complexity, with animal song belonging to regular languages,
whereas human language is superregular. This argument, however, lacks empirical
evidence since superregular analyses of animal song are understudied. The goal
of this paper is to perform a superregular analysis of animal song, using data
from gibbons as a case study, and demonstrate that a superregular analysis can
be effectively used with non-human data. A key finding is that a superregular
analysis does not increase explanatory power but rather provides for compact
analysis: Fewer grammatical rules are necessary once superregularity is
allowed. This pattern is analogous to a previous computational analysis of
human language, and accordingly, the null hypothesis, that human language and
animal song are governed by the same type of grammatical systems, cannot be
rejected.

visualise this uncertainty are presented, e.g. highest posterior density
credible regions, and local credible intervals (cf. error bars) for individual

problems and can be scaled to high-dimensional settings. Moreover, we present
strategies to automatically set regularisation parameters so that the proposed

  Adversarial Networks",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Suppressing bones on chest X-rays such as ribs and clavicle is often expected
to improve pathologies classification. These bones can interfere with a broad
range of diagnostic tasks on pulmonary disease except for musculoskeletal
system. Current conventional method for acquisition of bone suppressed X-rays
is dual energy imaging, which captures two radiographs at a very short interval
with different energy levels; however, the patient is exposed to radiation
twice and the artifacts arise due to heartbeats between two shots. In this
paper, we introduce a deep generative model trained to predict bone suppressed
images on single energy chest X-rays, analyzing a finite set of previously
acquired dual energy chest X-rays. Since the relatively small amount of data is
available, such approach relies on the methodology maximizing the data
utilization. Here we integrate the following two approaches. First, we use a
conditional generative adversarial network that complements the traditional
regression method minimizing the pairwise image difference. Second, we use Haar
2D wavelet decomposition to offer a perceptual guideline in frequency details
to allow the model to converge quickly and efficiently. As a result, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on bone suppression as compared to the existing
approaches with dual energy chest X-rays.

degrees of aggressiveness, variable prognosis and various heterogeneous
histologic sub-regions, i.e., peritumoral edematous/invaded tissue, necrotic
core, active and non-enhancing core. This intrinsic heterogeneity is also
portrayed in their radio-phenotype, as their sub-regions are depicted by
varying intensity profiles disseminated across multi-parametric magnetic
resonance imaging (mpMRI) scans, reflecting varying biological properties.
Their heterogeneous shape, extent, and location are some of the factors that
make these tumors difficult to resect, and in some cases inoperable. The amount
of resected tumor is a factor also considered in longitudinal scans, when
evaluating the apparent tumor for potential diagnosis of progression.
Furthermore, there is mounting evidence that accurate segmentation of the
various tumor sub-regions can offer the basis for quantitative image analysis
towards prediction of patient overall survival. This study assesses the
state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) methods used for brain tumor image
analysis in mpMRI scans, during the last seven instances of the International
Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge, i.e., 2012-2018. Specifically, we
focus on i) evaluating segmentations of the various glioma sub-regions in
pre-operative mpMRI scans, ii) assessing potential tumor progression by virtue
of longitudinal growth of tumor sub-regions, beyond use of the RECIST/RANO
criteria, and iii) predicting the overall survival from pre-operative mpMRI
scans of patients that underwent gross total resection. Finally, we investigate
the challenge of identifying the best ML algorithms for each of these tasks,
considering that apart from being diverse on each instance of the challenge,
the multi-institutional mpMRI BraTS dataset has also been a continuously
evolving/growing dataset.

large magnetic flux within the bore of the resonator. However, there also
exists a non-negligible magnetic flux in the free space surrounding the
resonator. The energy losses associated with this radiated power diminish the
resonator's quality factor. In the toroidal SRR, on the other hand, the
magnetic field lines are strongly confined within the bore of the resonator
resulting in high intrinsic quality factors and stable resonance frequencies
without requiring additional electromagnetic shielding. This paper describes
the design and construction of a toroidal SRR as well as an experimental
investigation of its cw response in the frequency-domain and its time-domain
response to an rf pulse. Additionally, the dependence of the toroidal SRR's
resonant frequency and quality factor on the strength of inductive coupling to

system of ordinary differential and algebraic equations. Languages and
simulation tools for modeling such systems differ in syntax, informal
semantics, and in the methods by which such systems of equations are generated
and simulated, leading to numerous interoperability challenges. Logical
extensions of SysML aim specially at unifying a subset of the underlying
concepts in such languages. We propose to unify semantics of all such systems
using standard notions from algebraic topology. In particular, Tonti diagrams
classify all physical theories in terms of physical laws (topological and
constitutive) defined over a pair of dual cochain complexes and may be used to
describe different types of lumped parameter systems. We show that all possible
methods for generating the corresponding state equations within each physical
domain correspond to paths over Tonti diagrams. We further propose a
generalization of Tonti diagram that captures the behavior and supports
canonical generation of state equations for multi-domain lumped parameter
systems. The unified semantics provides a basis for greater interoperability in
systems modeling, supporting automated translation, integration, reuse, and
numerical simulation of models created in different authoring systems and
applications. Notably, the proposed algebraic topological semantics is also
compatible with spatially and temporally distributed models that are at the
core of modern CAD and CAE systems.

  Matrix Profile","PhD dissertation (2018)",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The last decade has seen a flurry of research on all-pairs-similarity-search
(or, self-join) for text, DNA, and a handful of other datatypes, and these
systems have been applied to many diverse data mining problems. Surprisingly,
however, little progress has been made on addressing this problem for time
series subsequences. In this thesis, we have introduced a near universal time
series data mining tool called matrix profile which solves the
all-pairs-similarity-search problem and caches the output in an easy-to-access
fashion. The proposed algorithm is not only parameter-free, exact and scalable,
but also applicable for both single and multidimensional time series. By
building time series data mining methods on top of matrix profile, many time
series data mining tasks (e.g., motif discovery, discord discovery, shapelet
discovery, semantic segmentation, and clustering) can be efficiently solved.
Because the same matrix profile can be shared by a diverse set of time series
data mining methods, matrix profile is versatile and
computed-once-use-many-times data structure. We demonstrate the utility of
matrix profile for many time series data mining problems, including motif
discovery, discord discovery, weakly labeled time series classification, and
representation learning on domains as diverse as seismology, entomology, music
processing, bioinformatics, human activity monitoring, electrical power-demand
monitoring, and medicine. We hope the matrix profile is not the end but the
beginning of many more time series data mining projects.

  Customary Tests","Pre-Print (Materials and Structures), 20 pages, 11 figures",,,"18-07/788m","physics.geo-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The reporting and evaluation of creep tests of concrete is complicated by the
fact that creep is significant even for the shortest observable load durations.
Compared to the strain after 0.1 s load duration, the strain at 2 hour duration
is typically 53% greater. Most experimenters have for decades been unaware of
this fact. Consequently, the reported creep curves require correction by a time
shift, which ranges from 0 to 2 hours. This further implies a vertical shift of
entire creep curve, important for all times up to structure lifetime. To filter
out the errors, it is argued that, within an initial period during which the
advance of hydration is negligible, which is normally about 1 day, the initial
basic creep must follow a power law of the time. Creep test data from the
literature are used to prove it. Corrections by time and deformation shifts are
determined by minimization of the sum of squared deviations of the power law
from the creep test data. For a fixed exponent n and time shift s, the
optimization is reduced to linear regressions of two kinds, depending on
whether the data are given in terms of either the compliance function or the
creep coefficient. For both, the linear regression parameters depend
nonlinearly on the chosen values of n and s. To avoid nonlinear optimization,
which need not converge to the correct result, a set of many discrete values of
n and s within their realistic ranges is selected and the (n,s) combination
minimizing the objective function is obtained by a search. Enforcing a power
law form of the initial creep curve is found to lead to better data fits. The
optimum exponent n for the entire database is around 0.3, applicable to the
time period cca (10 s, 1 day). After that, the exponent transits to about 0.1,
and prior to that it is about 0.08.

single loop of wire couples the receiving coil to a load impedance. A matching
circuit was used to tune the impedance of the system of coupled resonators to
match the 50-$\ohm$ output impedance of the signal generator. A low-cost vector
network analyzer was used to characterize the system performance as the
distance between the pair of coils was changed. When the distance between the

frequency difference between the pair resonances was inversely proportional to
the distance between the coils. After the system was fully characterized, it

power-based detection techniques presume that HTs are detectable because they
only add gates to the original circuit with a noticeable increase in power

zero impact on the power and area footprint of the original circuit. Towards
this, we propose a novel concept of TrojanZero and a systematic methodology for
designing undetectable HTs in the circuits, which conceals their existence by
gate-level modifications. The crux is to salvage the cost of the HT from the
original circuit without being detected using standard testing techniques. Our
methodology leverages the knowledge of transition probabilities of the circuit
nodes to identify and safely remove expendable gates, and embeds malicious
circuitry at the appropriate locations with zero power and area overheads when
compared to the original circuit. We synthesize these designs and then embed in
multiple ISCAS85 benchmarks using a 65nm technology library, and perform a
comprehensive power and area characterization. Our experimental results
