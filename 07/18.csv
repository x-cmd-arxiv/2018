  bases, and Tutte polynomial of a matroid in terms of beta invariants of
  minors","27 pages",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce and study filtrations of a matroid on a linearly ordered ground
set, which are particular sequences of nested sets. A given basis can be
decomposed into a uniquely defined sequence of bases of minors, such that these
bases have an internal/external activity equal to 1/0 or 0/1 (in the sense of
Tutte polynomial activities). This decomposition, which we call the active
filtration/partition of the basis, refines the known partition of the ground
set into internal and external elements with respect to a given basis. It can
be built by a certain closure operator, which we call the active closure. It
relies only on the fundamental bipartite graph of the basis and can be
expressed also as a decomposition of general bipartite graphs on a linearly
ordered set of vertices.
  From this, first, structurally, we obtain that the set of all bases can be
canonically partitioned and decomposed in terms of such bases of minors induced
by filtrations. Second, enumeratively, we derive an expression of the Tutte
polynomial of a matroid in terms of beta invariants of minors. This expression
refines at the same time the classical expressions in terms of basis activities
and orientation activities (if the matroid is oriented), and the well-known
convolution formula for the Tutte polynomial. Third, in a companion paper of
the same series (No. 2.b), we use this decomposition of matroid bases, along
with a similar decomposition of oriented matroids, and along with a bijection
in the 1/0 activity case from a previous paper (No. 1), to define the canonical
active bijection between orientations/signatures/reorientations and spanning
trees/simplices/bases of a graph/real hyperplane arrangement/oriented matroid,
as well as various related bijections.

the initial set of evidence is mixed with different types of evidence (i.e.,
pro vs. con or noisy vs. valuable) which is incorporated into the opinions of
original propagators, who propagate information over a network. With the help
of an extensive simulation study, we examine how the different ratios of
information types or agents' prior belief or topic competence affect the
overall information diffusion. Based on our findings, agents' high uncertainty
is not necessarily always bad in making a right decision as long as they are
competent enough not to be at least biased towards false information (e.g.,

far from this state. The relaxation time $\tau_\pi$ characterizes the rate of
isotropization and is a transport coefficient as fundamental as the shear
viscosity. We show that fluctuations emerging from the initial anisotropy
survive to freeze-out, in excess of thermal fluctuations, influencing rapidity
correlation patterns. We show that these correlations can be used to extract
$\tau_\pi$. We describe a method for calculating the rapidity dependence of
two-particle momentum correlations with a second order, causal, diffusion
equation that includes Langevin noise as a source of thermal fluctuations. The
causality requirement introduces the relaxation time and we link the shape of
the rapidity correlation pattern to its presence. Here we examine how different
equations of state and temperature dependent transport coefficients in the
presence of realistic hydrodynamic flow influence the estimate of $\tau_\pi$.

increasing interest. Tilt of Dirac cone can be realized in a number of
materials, including deformed graphene, surface state of topological
crystalline insulator, and certain organic compound. We study how Dirac cone
tilting affects the low-energy properties by presenting a renormalization group
analysis of the Coulomb interaction and quenched disorder. Random scalar
potential or random vector potential along the tilting direction cannot exist
on its own as it always dynamically generates a new type of disorder, which
dominates at low energies and turns the system into a compressible diffusive
metal. Consequently, the fermions acquire a finite disorder scattering rate.
Moreover, the isolated band-touching point is replaced by a bulk Fermi arc in
the Brillouin zone. These results are not qualitatively changed when the
Coulomb interaction is incorporated. In comparison, random mass and random
vector potential along the non-tilting direction can exist individually,
without generating other types of disorder. They both suppress tilt at low
energies, and do not produce bulk Fermi arc. Upon taking the Coulomb
interaction into account, the system enters into a stable quantum critical
state, in which the fermion field acquires a finite anomalous dimension but the
dynamical exponent $z=1$. These results indicate that Dirac cone tilt does lead
to some qualitatively different low-energy properties comparing to the untilted
system.

Simulations and analysis of a gene expression data set illustrate our model's

application of both low and high magnetic fields. The application of a weak
magnetic field reduces the singlet yield of a singlet-born radical pair,
whereas the application of a strong magnetic field increases the singlet yield.
The high field effect arises from energy conservation: when the magnetic field
is stronger than the sum of the hyperfine fields in the two radicals, ${\rm
S}\to {\rm T}_{\pm}$ transitions become energetically forbidden, thereby
reducing the number of pathways for singlet to triplet interconversion. The low
field effect arises from symmetry breaking: the application of a weak magnetic
field lifts degeneracies among the zero field eigenstates and increases the
number of pathways for singlet to triplet interconversion. However, the details
of this effect are more subtle, and have not previously been properly
explained. Here we present a complete analysis of the low field effect in a
radical pair containing a single proton, and in a radical pair in which one of
the radicals contains a large number of hyperfine-coupled nuclear spins. We
find that the new transitions that occur when the field is switched on are
between ${\rm S}$ and ${\rm T}_0$ in both cases, and not between ${\rm S}$ and
${\rm T}_{\pm}$ as has previously been claimed. We then illustrate this result
by using it in conjunction with semiclassical spin dynamics simulations to
account for the observation of a biphasic--triphasic--biphasic transition with
increasing magnetic field strength in the magnetic field effect on the
time-dependent survival probability of a photoexcited
carotenoid-porphyrin-fullerene radical pair.

the sites S234, V582, and IRAS 05231+3512 situated toward l = 171.7 - 174.1
degrees. Based on the CO line data, we find that these sites are not physically
connected, and contain at least one filament (with length > 7 pc). The observed
line masses (M_line,obs) of the filaments associated with V582 and IRAS
05231+3512 are ~37 and ~28 M_sun/pc, respectively. These filaments are
characterized as thermally supercritical, and harbor several clumps. Groups of
infrared-excess sources and massive B-type stars are observed toward the
filament containing V582, while a very little star formation (SF) activity is
found around IRAS 05231+3512. Our results favour radial collapse scenario in
the filaments harboring V582 and IRAS 05231+3512. In the site S234, two
filaments (i.e. ns1 (M_line,obs ~130 M_sun/pc) and ns2 (M_line,obs ~45
M_sun/pc)) are identified as thermally supercritical. An extended temperature
structure at 27-30 K surrounds a relatively cold (~19 K) ~8.9 pc long filament
ns1. At least four condensations (M_clump ~70-300 M_sun) are seen in ns1, and
are devoid of the GMRT 610 MHz radio emission. The filament ns2 hosting clumps
is devoid of ongoing SF, and could be at an early stage of fragmentation. An
intense SF activity, having the SF efficiency ~3.3% and SF rate ~40-20
M_sun/Myr (for t_sf ~1-2 Myr), is observed in ns1. The feedback of massive
stars in S234 seems to explain the observed SF in the filament ns1.

a Langevin dynamics with weak noise, we introduce conditioned large deviations

series of papers in oriented matroids. The present paper is intended to state
the main results in the particular case, and more widespread language, of
graphs. We associate any directed graph, defined on a linearly ordered set of
edges, with one particular of its spanning trees, which we call its active
spanning tree. For any graph on a linearly ordered set of edges, this yields a
surjective mapping from orientations onto spanning trees, which preserves
activities (for orientations in the sense of Las Vergnas, for spanning trees in
the sense of Tutte), as well as some partitions (or filtrations) of the edge
set associated with orientations and spanning trees. It yields a canonical
bijection between classes of orientations and spanning trees, as well as a
refined bijection between all orientations and edge subsets, containing various
noticeable bijections [...]. Several constructions of independent interest are
involved. The basic case concerns bipolar orientations, which are in bijection
with their fully optimal spanning trees, as proved in a previous paper, and as
computed in a companion paper. We give a canonical decomposition of a directed
graph on a linearly ordered set of edges into acyclic/cyclic bipolar directed
graphs. Considering all orientations of a graph, we obtain an expression of the
Tutte polynomial in terms of products of beta invariants of minors, a
remarkable partition of the set of orientations into activity classes, and a
simple expression of the Tutte polynomial using four orientation activity
parameters. We derive a similar decomposition theorem for spanning trees. We
also provide a general deletion/contraction framework for these bijections and
relatives.

derivation of the upper bounds for the asymptotic gains is performed by either
employing an eigenfunction expansion methodology or by means of a small-gain

One example of such information is the semantic segmentation of a shape into
functional or meaningful parts. Generating accurate segmentations with
meaningful segment boundaries is, however, a costly process, typically
requiring large amounts of user time to achieve high quality results. In this
paper we present an active learning framework for large dataset segmentation,
which iteratively provides the user with new predictions by training new models
based on already segmented shapes. Our proposed pipeline consists of three
novel components. First, we a propose a fast and relatively accurate
feature-based deep learning model to provide dataset-wide segmentation
predictions. Second, we propose an information theory measure to estimate the
prediction quality and for ordering subsequent fast and meaningful shape
selection. Our experiments show that such suggestive ordering helps reduce
users time and effort, produce high quality predictions, and construct a model
that generalizes well. Finally, we provide effective segmentation refinement
features to help the user quickly correct any incorrect predictions. We show
that our framework is more accurate and in general more efficient than
state-of-the-art, for massive dataset segmentation with while also providing
consistent segment boundaries.

linearly ordered set of edges (ordered graph) with adjacent unique source and
sink (bipolar digraph) has a unique fully optimal spanning tree, that satisfies
a simple criterion on fundamental cycle/cocycle directions. This result yields,
for any ordered graph, a canonical bijection between bipolar orientations and
spanning trees with internal activity 1 and external activity 0 in the sense of
the Tutte polynomial. This bijection can be extended to all orientations and
all spanning trees, yielding the active bijection, presented for graphs in a
companion paper. In this paper, we specifically address the problem of the
computation of the fully optimal spanning tree of an ordered bipolar digraph.
In contrast with the inverse mapping, built by a straightforward single pass
over the edge set, the direct computation is not easy and had previously been
left aside. We give two independent constructions. The first one is a
deletion/contraction recursion, involving an exponential number of minors. It
is structurally significant but it is efficient only for building the whole
bijection (i.e. all images) at once. The second one is more complicated and is
the main contribution of the paper. It involves just one minor for each edge of
the resulting spanning tree, and it is a translation and an adaptation in the
case of graphs, in terms of weighted cocycles, of a general geometrical linear
programming type algorithm, which allows for a polynomial time complexity.

within the network are noisy. One of the motivations for looking into this
problem is to reduce the high power cost of conventional computing of neural
network operations through the use of analog neuromorphic circuits. Traditional
GPU/CPU-centered deep learning architectures exhibit bottlenecks in
power-restricted applications, such as speech recognition in embedded systems.
The use of specialized neuromorphic circuits, where analog signals passed
through memory-cell arrays are sensed to accomplish matrix-vector
multiplications, promises large power savings and speed gains but brings with
it the problems of limited precision of computations and unavoidable analog
noise.
  In this paper we propose a method, called {\em Deep Noise Injection
training}, to train RNNs to obtain a set of weights/biases that is much more
robust against noisy computation during inference. We explore several RNN
architectures, such as vanilla RNN and long-short-term memories (LSTM), and
show that after convergence of Deep Noise Injection training the set of trained
weights/biases has more consistent performance over a wide range of noise
powers entering the network during inference. Surprisingly, we find that Deep
Noise Injection training improves overall performance of some networks even for
numerically accurate inference.

Chimera, a shared factorization model that can simultaneously account for graph

that takes into account the temporal continuity of these embeddings. Such an

from mixing with other operators of the same dimension. In the lattice

nonperturbative renormalization is conducted in a regularization-independent
momentum subtraction scheme, and the matching between the renormalized
quasi-PDF and $\bar{\rm MS}$ PDF is calculated based on perturbative QCD up to
one-loop order. Systematic errors due to renormalization and perturbative
matching are also analyzed in detail. Our results for lightcone PDF are in
reasonable agreement with the latest phenomenological analysis.

control over how to build and fit radial density profiles for interstellar
filaments. RadFil builds filament profiles by taking radial cuts across the
spine of a filament, thereby preserving the radial structure of the filament
across its entire length. Pre-existing spines can be inputted directly into
RadFil, or can be computed using the FilFinder package as part of the RadFil
workflow. We provide Gaussian and Plummer built-in fitting functions, in
addition to a background subtraction estimator, which can be fit to the entire
ensemble of radial cuts or an average radial profile for the filament. Users
can tweak parameters like the radial cut sampling interval, the background
subtraction estimation radii, and the Gaussian/Plummer fitting radii. As a
result, RadFil can provide treatment of how the resulting filament properties
rely on systematics in the building and fitting process. We walk through the
typical RadFil workflow and compare our results to those from an independent
radial density profile code obtained using the same data; we find that our
results are entirely consistent. RadFil is open source and available on GitHub.
We also provide a complete working tutorial of the code available as a Jupyter
notebook which users can download and run themselves.

we compare directly the density-pressure constraint on the EoS obtained from a
recent analysis of the neutron-star merger event to density-pressure
constraints obtained from nuclear physics experiments. To relate constraints
from nuclear physics to the radii and the tidal deformabilities of neutron
stars, we use a large collection of Skyrme density functionals that describe
properties of nuclei to calculate properties of 1.4 solar maass neutron stars.
We find that restricting this set of Skyrme equations of state to density
functionals that describe nuclear masses, isobaric analog states, and low
energy nuclear reactions does not sufficiently restrict the predicted
neutron-star radii and the tidal deformabilities. Including pressure
constraints on the EoS around twice saturation density, obtained from high
energy nucleus-nucleus collisions, does constrain predicted radii and tidal
deformabilities to be consistent with the results obtained from the analysis of
GW170817. We discuss how new measurements of nucleus-nucleus collisions can
improve these constraints on the EoS to be more restrictive than the current

that the zero-field Ising model has no Fisher zeros in a complex neighborhood

-- where sender and receiver, remarkably, exchange no particles. We employ
cavity quantum electrodynamics, estimating resources for beating the classical
fidelity limit -- except, unlike teleportation, no pre-shared entanglement nor
classical communication are required. Our approach is multiple orders of
magnitude more efficient in terms of physical resources than previously
proposed implementations, paving the way for a demonstration using existing
imperfect devices. Surprisingly, while such communication is intuitively
explained in terms of ""interaction-free"" measurement and the Zeno effect, we
show that neither is necessary, with far-reaching implications in support of an
underlying physical reality. We go on to characterise an explanatory framework
for counterportation starting from constructor theory: local wormholes.
Conversely, a counterportation experiment demonstrating the traversability of

hand-crafted rules as in traditional exemplar-based methods, our end-to-end
colorization network learns how to select, propagate, and predict colors from
the large-scale data. The approach performs robustly and generalizes well even
when using reference images that are unrelated to the input grayscale image.
More importantly, as opposed to other learning-based colorization methods, our
network allows the user to achieve customizable results by simply feeding
different references. In order to further reduce manual effort in selecting the
references, the system automatically recommends references with our proposed
image retrieval algorithm, which considers both semantic and luminance
information. The colorization can be performed fully automatically by simply
picking the top reference suggestion. Our approach is validated through a user

Furthermore, our approach can be naturally extended to video colorization. Our

posts into different views or stories (or, world views). However, this can be
challenging as it requires an understanding of the data, including determining
what is consistent data, and what data corroborates other data. Attempting to
address these problems, this article proposes Subject-Verb-Object Semantic
Suffix Tree Clustering (SVOSSTC) and a system to support it, with a special
focus on Twitter content. The novelty and value of SVOSSTC is its emphasis on
utilising the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) typology in order to construct
semantically consistent world views, in which individuals---particularly those
involved in crisis response---might achieve an enhanced picture of a situation
from social media data. To evaluate our system and its ability to provide
enhanced situation awareness, we tested it against existing approaches,
including human data analysis, using a variety of real-world scenarios. The
results indicated a noteworthy degree of evidence (e.g., in cluster granularity

come from synchrotron emission of CR electrons. In this paper, we present an
analysis of 105 months of Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope observations of the
Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), with the aim of exploring CR feedback and
transport in an external galaxy. We produce maps of the 2-300 GeV emission and
detect statistically significant, extended emission along the Bar and the Wing,
where active star formation is occurring. Gamma-ray emission is not detected
above 13 GeV, and we set stringent upper-limits on the flux above this energy.
We find the best fit to the gamma-ray spectrum is a single-component model with
a power-law of index $\Gamma=-2.11\pm0.06\pm0.06$ and an exponential cutoff
energy of $E_{\rm c} =13.1\pm5.1\pm1.6$ GeV. We assess the relative
contribution of pulsars and CRs to the emission, and we find that pulsars may
produce up to 14$^{+4}_{-2}$% of the flux above 100 MeV. Thus, we attribute
most of the gamma-ray emission (based on its spectrum and morphology) to CR
interactions with the ISM. We show that the gamma-ray emissivity of the SMC is
five times smaller than that of the Milky Way and that the SMC is far below the
calorimetric limit, where all CR protons experience pion losses. We interpret
these findings as evidence that CRs are escaping the SMC via advection and
diffusion.

expand these collapse studies for the first time to span a wide range of
initial cloud masses from 0.5 to 100 Msun. Understanding the complexity of the
numerous physical processes involved in the very early stages of star formation
requires detailed thermodynamical modeling in terms of radiation transport and
phase transitions. For this we use a realistic gas equation of state via a
density and temperature-dependent adiabatic index and mean molecular weight to
model the phase transitions. We use a gray treatment of radiative transfer
coupled with hydrodynamics to simulate Larson's collapse in spherical symmetry.
We reveal a dependence of a variety of first core properties on the initial
cloud mass. The first core radius and mass increase from the low-mass to the
intermediate-mass regime and decrease from the intermediate-mass to the
high-mass regime. The lifetime of first cores strongly decreases towards the
intermediate- and high-mass regime. Our studies show the presence of a
transition region in the intermediate-mass regime. Low-mass protostars tend to
evolve through two distinct stages of formation which are related to the first

($B/D$) for the progenitor; i.e., the target galaxy. We find that the lifetime
of the ring correlates with the initial impact velocity vertical to the disk
plane (i.e., $v_{z0}$). Three orbits for the collisional galaxy pair, on which
clear and asymmetric rings form after collisions, are selected to perform the
\textit{N}-body simulations at different values of $B/D$ for the progenitor. It
is found that the ring structures are the strongest for the CRGs with small
values of $B/D$. The S\'{e}rsic index, $n$, of the central remnant in the
target galaxy becomes larger after collision. Moreover, the S\'{e}rsic index of
a central remnant strongly correlates with the initial value of $B/D$ for the
progenitor. A bulge-less progenitor results in a late-type object in the center
of the ring galaxy, whereas a bulge-dominated progenitor leads to an early-type
central remnant. Progenitors with $B/D\in [0.1,~0.3]$ (i.e., minor bulges)
leave central remnants with $n\approx 4$. These results provide a possible
explanation for the formation of a recently observed CRG with an early-type

the mean density of the surrounding medium, while a SNR in a more turbulent
medium with higher supersonic turbulent Mach number shows lower interior
temperature, lower radial momentum, and dimmer X-ray emission compared to one
in a less turbulent medium with the same mean density. We compare our
simulations to observed SNRs, in particular, to W44, W28 and IC 443. We
estimate that the mean density of the ambient medium is $\sim 10\,$cm$^{-3}$
for W44 and W28. The MC in front of IC 443 has a density of $\sim
100\,$cm$^{-3}$. We also predict that the ambient MC of W44 is more turbulent
than that of W28 and IC 443. The ambient medium of W44 and W28 has
significantly lower average density than that of the host giant MC. This result
may be related to the stellar feedback from the SNRs' progenitors.
Alternatively, SNe may occur close to the interface between molecular gas and
lower density atomic gas. The region of shocked MC is then relatively small and

polynomial on the unit circle in the complex plane of an $N\times N$ random
unitary matrix $A$, we calculate the $k$th moment, defined with respect to an
average over $A\in U(N)$, of the random variable corresponding to the
$2\beta$th moment of $P_N(A,\theta)$ with respect to the uniform measure
$\frac{d\theta}{2\pi}$, for all $k, \beta\in\mathbb{N}$ . These moments of
moments have played an important role in recent investigations of the extreme
value statistics of characteristic polynomials and their connections with
log-correlated Gaussian fields. Our approach is based on a new combinatorial
representation of the moments using the theory of symmetric functions, and an
analysis of a second representation in terms of multiple contour integrals. Our
main result is that the moments of moments are polynomials in $N$ of degree
$k^2\beta^2-k+1$. This resolves a conjecture of Fyodorov \&
Keating~\cite{fyodorov14} concerning the scaling of the moments with $N$ as
$N\rightarrow\infty$, for $k,\beta\in\mathbb{N}$. Indeed, it goes further in
that we give a method for computing these polynomials explicitly and obtain a
general formula for the leading coefficient.

they should map to the same representation. We propose
invariant-representation-learning (IRL): At each training iteration, for each

coerce matched representations at each layer (above some chosen layer). Our key
results, demonstrated on the Librispeech dataset are the following: (i) IRL
significantly reduces character error rates (CER) on both 'clean' (3.3% vs
6.5%) and 'other' (11.0% vs 18.1%) test sets; (ii) on several out-of-domain

characterized by fluid-like densities. Under those conditions, standard
approximations used in model atmosphere codes are no longer appropriate.
Unfortunately, the majority of cool He-rich white dwarfs show no spectral
features, giving us no opportunities to put more elaborate models to the test.
In the few cases where spectral features are observed (such as in cool DQ or DZ
stars), current models completely fail to reproduce the spectroscopic data,
signaling shortcomings in our theoretical framework. In order to fully trust
parameters derived solely from the energy distribution, it is thus important to
at least succeed in reproducing the spectra of the few coolest stars exhibiting
spectral features, especially since such stars possess even less extreme
physical conditions due to the presence of heavy elements. In this paper, we
revise every building block of our model atmosphere code in order to eliminate
low-density approximations. Our updated white dwarf atmosphere code
incorporates state-of-the-art constitutive physics suitable for the conditions
found in cool helium-rich stars (DC and DZ white dwarfs). This includes new
high-density metal line profiles, nonideal continuum opacities, an accurate
equation of state and a detailed description of the ionization equilibrium. In
particular, we present new ab initio calculations to assess the ionization
equilibrium of heavy elements (C, Ca, Fe, Mg and Na) in a dense helium medium

simulation. The PDE grid approach is not particularly feasible due to Curse of
Dimensionality. The standard Monte Carlo method for American/Bermudan swaption
pricing more or less uses regression to estimate expected value as a linear
combination of basis functions (Longstaff and Schwartz). However, Monte Carlo
method only provides the lower bound for American option price. Another
complexity is the computation of the sensitivities of the option, the so-called
Greeks, which are fundamental for a trader's hedging activity. Recently, an
alternative numerical method based on deep learning and backward stochastic
differential equations appeared in quite a few researches. For European style
options the feedforward deep neural networks (DNN) show not only feasibility

a new backward DNN solver is proposed for Bermudan swaptions. Our approach is
representing financial pricing problems in the form of high dimensional
stochastic optimal control problems, FBSDEs, or equivalent PDEs. We demonstrate
that using backward DNN the high-dimension Bermudan swaption pricing and
hedging can be solved effectively and efficiently. A comparison between Monte
Carlo simulation and the new method for pricing vanilla interest rate options
manifests the superior performance of the new method. We then use this method
to calculate prices and Greeks of Bermudan swaptions as a prelude for other

previous state-of-the-art bounds for Triangle Detection and Enumeration were
$\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})$ and $\tilde{O}(n^{3/4})$, respectively, due to Izumi and

  The main technical novelty in this work is a distributed graph partitioning
algorithm. We show that in $\tilde{O}(n^{1-\delta})$ rounds we can partition
the edge set of the network $G=(V,E)$ into three parts $E=E_m\cup E_s\cup E_r$
such that
  (a) Each connected component induced by $E_m$ has minimum degree
$\Omega(n^\delta)$ and conductance $\Omega(1/\text{poly} \log(n))$. As a
consequence the mixing time of a random walk within the component is
$O(\text{poly} \log(n))$.
  (b) The subgraph induced by $E_s$ has arboricity at most $n^{\delta}$.
  (c) $|E_r| \leq |E|/6$.
  All of our algorithms are based on the following generic framework, which we
believe is of interest beyond this work. Roughly, we deal with the set $E_s$ by
an algorithm that is efficient for low-arboricity graphs, and deal with the set
$E_r$ using recursive calls. For each connected component induced by $E_m$, we
are able to simulate congested clique algorithms with small overhead by
applying a routing algorithm due to Ghaffari, Kuhn, and Su (PODC 2017) for high
conductance graphs.

numerous studies of young clusters. We attempt to reconcile this apparent
contradiction. Stars mostly form in Giant Molecular Clouds, and the more
massive stars ($\gtrsim 3$ M$_\odot$) may have insufficient time before their
deaths to uniformly populate the solar circle of the Galaxy. We examine the
effect of small sample volumes on the {\it apparent} slope, $\Gamma_{\rm app}$,
of the high-mass IMF by modeling the present day mass function (PDMF) over the
mass range $1.5-6$ M$_\odot$. Depending on the location of the observer along
the solar circle and the size of the sample volume, the apparent slope of the
IMF can show a wide variance, with typical values steeper than the underlying
universal value $\Gamma$. We show, for example, that the PDMFs observed in a
small (radius $\sim 200$ pc) volume randomly placed at the solar circle have a
$\sim 15-30$\% likelihood of resulting in $\Gamma_{\rm app} \gtrsim \Gamma+
0.35$ because of inhomogeneities in the surface densities of more massive
stars. If we add the a priori knowledge that the Sun currently lies in an
interarm region, where the star formation rate is lower than the average at the

widely used to speed up the training process by using multiple workers. It uses
multiple workers to sample local stochastic gradient in parallel, aggregates
all gradients in a single server to obtain the average, and update each
worker's local model using a SGD update with the averaged gradient. Ideally,
parallel mini-batch SGD can achieve a linear speed-up of the training time
(with respect to the number of workers) compared with SGD over a single worker.
However, such linear scalability in practice is significantly limited by the
growing demand for gradient communication as more workers are involved. Model
averaging, which periodically averages individual models trained over parallel
workers, is another common practice used for distributed training of deep
neural networks since (Zinkevich et al. 2010) (McDonald, Hall, and Mann 2010).
Compared with parallel mini-batch SGD, the communication overhead of model
averaging is significantly reduced. Impressively, tremendous experimental works
have verified that model averaging can still achieve a good speed-up of the
training time as long as the averaging interval is carefully controlled.
However, it remains a mystery in theory why such a simple heuristic works so
well. This paper provides a thorough and rigorous theoretical study on why
model averaging can work as well as parallel mini-batch SGD with significantly
less communication overhead.

the hallmark of a localized Majorana edge-state is an emergent quantized
zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP). However, such a conductance peak can also
result from other mechanisms; e.g., crossing (and sticking) of two branches of
a standard Andreev bound state, or a soft potential at the edge of the
superconductor. Since the emergence of a 'Majorana-ZBCP' must be accompanied by
an opening of a topological gap in the bulk, we performed two simultaneous
tunneling measurements: one in the bulk and another at the edge of the 1D
superconductor. Measurements were performed with an InAs nanowire in-situ
coated with epitaxial aluminum. For particular gate-tuning of the chemical
potential in the wire and a Zeeman field parallel to the wire, we observed a
closing of the superconducting bulk-gap followed by its reopening concomitant
with the appearance of a ZBCP at the edge. We note that a ZBCP could also be
observed with different tuning parameters without an observed reopening of the
bulk-gap. This demonstrates the importance of simultaneous probing of the bulk

the fact that neglecting the contribution of localized modes in any modal

inhomogeneous electromagnetic environment described by the most general linear
constitutive relations. The atom is modeled as a two-level system prepared in
an arbitrary initial energy state. Using the Heisenberg equation of motion
(HEM) and under the Markov approximation, we show that the optical torque has a
resonant and non-resonant part, associated respectively with a
spontaneous-emission process and Casimir-type interactions with the quantum
vacuum, which can both be written explicitly in terms of the system Green
function. Our formulation is valid for any inhomogeneous, dissipative,
dispersive, nonreciprocal, and bianisotropic structure. We apply this general
theory to a scenario in which the atom interacts with a material characterized
by strong nonreciprocity and modal unidirectionality. In this case, the main
decay channel of the atom energy is represented by the unidirectional surface
waves launched at the nonreciprocal material-vacuum interface. To provide
relevant physical insight into the role of these unidirectional surface waves
in the emergence of non-trivial optical torque, we derive closed-form
expressions for the induced torque under the quasi-static approximation.
Finally, we investigate the equilibrium states of the atom polarization, along
which the atom spontaneously tends to align due to the action of the torque.
Our theoretical predictions may be experimentally tested with cold Rydberg

problem, in which $k$ taxis serve a sequence of requests in a metric space. A
request consists of two points $s$ and $t$, representing a passenger that wants
to be carried by a taxi from $s$ to $t$. The goal is to serve all requests
while minimizing the total distance traveled by all taxis. The problem comes in
two flavors, called the easy and the hard $k$-taxi problem: In the easy
$k$-taxi problem, the cost is defined as the total distance traveled by the
taxis; in the hard $k$-taxi problem, the cost is only the distance of empty
runs.
  The hard $k$-taxi problem is substantially more difficult than the easy
version with at least an exponential deterministic competitive ratio,
$\Omega(2^k)$, admitting a reduction from the layered graph traversal problem.
In contrast, the easy $k$-taxi problem has exactly the same competitive ratio
as the $k$-server problem. We focus mainly on the hard version. For
hierarchically separated trees (HSTs), we present a memoryless randomized
algorithm with competitive ratio $2^k-1$ against adaptive online adversaries
and provide two matching lower bounds: for arbitrary algorithms against
adaptive adversaries and for memoryless algorithms against oblivious
adversaries. Due to well-known HST embedding techniques, the algorithm implies
a randomized $O(2^k\log n)$-competitive algorithm for arbitrary $n$-point
metrics. This is the first competitive algorithm for the hard $k$-taxi problem
for general finite metric spaces and general $k$. For the special case of
$k=2$, we obtain a precise answer of $9$ for the competitive ratio in general
metrics. With an algorithm based on growing, shrinking and shifting regions, we
show that one can achieve a constant competitive ratio also for the hard
$3$-taxi problem on the line (abstracting the scheduling of three elevators).

the stability of steady four-wave configurations that are the solutions of the
Riemann problem in the flow direction, consisting of two shocks, one vortex
sheet, and one entropy wave, which is one of the core multi-wave configurations
for the two-dimensional Euler equations. It is proved that such steady
four-wave configurations in supersonic flow are stable in structure globally,
even under the BV perturbation of the incoming flow in the flow direction. In
order to achieve this, we first formulate the problem as the Cauchy problem
(initial value problem) in the flow direction, and then develop a modified
Glimm difference scheme and identify a Glimm-type functional to obtain the
required BV estimates by tracing the interactions not only between the strong
shocks and weak waves, but also between the strong vortex sheet/entropy wave
and weak waves. The key feature of the Euler equations is that the reflection
coefficient is always less than 1, when a weak wave of different family
interacts with the strong vortex sheet/entropy wave or the shock wave, which is
crucial to guarantee that the Glimm functional is decreasing. Then these
estimates are employed to establish the convergence of the approximate
solutions to a global entropy solution, close to the background solution of
steady four-wave configuration.

influence of the photonic environment on Forster resonance energy transfer

traditional theory of FRET and experiments. Here we show that the quantum
electrodynamic theory of FRET near an engineered nanophotonic environment is
exactly equivalent to an effective near-field model describing electrostatic
dipole-dipole interactions. This leads to an intuitive and rigorously exact
description of FRET bridging the gap between experimental observations and
theoretical interpretations. We show that the widely used concept of the
Purcell factor is only important for understanding spontaneous emission and is
an incorrect figure of merit for analyzing FRET. To this end, we analyze the
figures of merit which characterize FRET in a photonic environment: (1) the
FRET rate enhancement factor ($F_{ET}$), (2) the FRET efficiency enhancement
factor ($F_{eff}$) and (3) the two-point spectral density ($S_{EE}$) governing
FRET analogous to the local density of states that controls spontaneous
emission. Counterintuitive to existing knowledge, we show that suppression of
the Purcell factor is in fact necessary for enhancing the efficiency of the
FRET process. We place fundamental bounds on the FRET figures of merit arising
from material absorption in the photonic environment as well as key properties
of emitters including intrinsic quantum efficiencies and orientational
dependence. Finally, we use our approach to conclusively explain recent
experiments and predict regimes where the FRET rate is expected to be enhanced,
suppressed or remain the same. Our work paves for a complete theory of FRET

neutron richness can reproduce the actinide boost. We also investigate the
sensitivity of actinide production on nuclear physics properties: fission
distribution, beta-decay, and mass model. For most cases, the actinides are
over-produced in our models if the initial conditions are sufficiently
neutron-rich for fission cycling. We find that actinide production can be so

Wideband Camera-plus (HAWC+) onboard the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared

foreground disk galaxy at $z$ = 0.22 and a nearly complete Einstein ring of an
intrinsic ultra-luminous infrared galaxy at $z$ = 1.03. Is this high IR
luminosity powered by pure star formation (SF) or also an active galactic
nucleus (AGN)? Previous nebular line diagnostics indicate that it is
star-formation dominated. We perform a 27-band multi-wavelength spectral energy
distribution modeling (SED) including the new SOFIA/HAWC+ data to constrain the
fractional AGN contribution to the total IR luminosity. The AGN fraction in the
IR turns out to be negligible. In addition, J1429-0028 serves as a testbed for
comparing SED results from different models/templates and SED codes (MAGPHYS,
SED3FIT, and CIGALE). We stress that star formation history is the dominant
source of uncertainty in the derived stellar mass (as high as a factor of
$\sim$ 10) even in the case of extensive photometric coverage. Furthermore, the
detection of a source at $z$ $\sim$ 1 with SOFIA/HAWC+ demonstrates the
potential of utilizing this facility for distant galaxy studies including the
decomposition of SF/AGN components, which cannot be accomplished with other
current facilities.

(experiments such as the Planet Formation Imager, PFI, see Monnier et al. 2018

the individual telescopes involved needs to be explored. In a recent
collaboration between engineers, experimental physicists and astronomers in
Valparaiso, Chile, we are gaining expertise in the production of light carbon
fiber polymer reinforced mirrors. The working principle consists in replicating
a glass, or other substrate, mandrel surface with the mirrored adequate
curvature, surface characteristics and general shape. Once the carbon fiber
base has hardened, previous studies have shown that it can be coated (aluminum)
using standard coating processes/techniques designed for glass-based mirrors.
The resulting surface quality is highly dependent on the temperature and

improving the smoothness of the resulting surfaces to meet near/mid infrared
specifications, overcoming, among others, possible deteriorations derived from
the replication process. In a second step, at the validation and quality
control stage, the mirrors are characterized using simple/traditional tools

theory, guaranteeing the existence of configurations which avoid a collection
$\mathcal B$ of ""bad"" events which are mostly independent and have low
probability. In its simplest form, it asserts that whenever a bad-event has
probability $p$ and affects at most $d$ other bad-events, and $e p (d+1) < 1$,
then a configuration avoiding all $\mathcal B$ exists. A seminal algorithm of
Moser & Tardos (2010) gives randomized algorithms for most constructions based
on the LLL. However, deterministic algorithms have lagged behind. Notably,
prior deterministic LLL algorithms have required stringent conditions on
$\mathcal B$; for example, they have required that events in $\mathcal B$ have
low decision-tree complexity or depend on a small number of variables. For this
reason, they can only be applied to small fraction of the numerous LLL
applications in practice. We describe an alternate deterministic parallel (NC)
algorithm for the LLL, based on a general derandomization method of Sivakumar
(2002) using log-space statistical tests. The only requirement here is that
bad-events should be computable via a finite automaton with $\text{poly}(d)$
states. This covers most LLL applications to graph theory and combinatorics. No
auxiliary information about the bad-events, including any conditional
probability calculations, are required. Additionally, the proof is a
straightforward combination of general derandomization results and high-level

defective vertex coloring, domatic partition, and independent transversals.

of semiconductors for solar cells and other optoelectronic applications.
Electron-phonon coupling plays a critical role in all optoelectronic devices,
and although the lattice dynamics and phonon frequencies of HOIPs have been
well studied, little attention has been given to phonon lifetimes. We report
the first high-precision measurements of acoustic phonon lifetimes in the
hybrid perovskite methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI), using inelastic neutron
spectroscopy to provide high energy resolution and fully deuterated single
crystals to reduce incoherent scattering from hydrogen. Our measurements reveal
extremely short lifetimes on the order of picoseconds, corresponding to
nanometer mean free paths and demonstrating that acoustic phonons are unable to
dissipate heat efficiently. Lattice-dynamics calculations using ab-initio
third-order perturbation theory indicate that the short lifetimes stem from
strong three-phonon interactions and a high density of low-energy optical
phonon modes related to the degrees of freedom of the organic cation. Such
short lifetimes have significant implications for electron-phonon coupling in
MAPI and other HOIPs, with direct impacts on optoelectronic devices both in the
cooling of hot carriers and in the transport and recombination of band edge
carriers. These findings illustrate a fundamental difference between HOIPs and
conventional photovoltaic semiconductors and demonstrate the importance of
understanding lattice dynamics in the effort to develop metal halide perovskite
optoelectronic devices.

produce spectral index maps with the multi-frequency-synthesis deconvolution

and spectral index values between $-0.1$ and 1.3. We prove a strong correlation

self-trapping regime, by means of the Bogoliubov quasiparticle projection
method. For very small imbalance between left and right wells only the lowest
Bogoliubov mode is significantly occupied. In this regime the system performs
plasma oscillations at the corresponding frequency, and the evolution of the
condensate is characterized by a periodic transfer of population between the
ground and the first excited state. As the initial imbalance is increased, more
excited modes -- though initially not macroscopically occupied -- get coupled
during the evolution of the system. Since their population also varies with
time, the frequency spectrum of the imbalance turns out to be still peaked
around a single frequency, which is continuously shifted towards lower values.
The nonlinear mixing between Bogoliubov modes eventually drives the system into
the the self-trapping regime, when the population of the ground state can be
transferred completely to the excited states at some time during the evolution.
For simplicity, here we consider a one-dimensional setup, but the results are

that it leverages previously captured knowledge about project traceability to

bipolar, i.e. contain both attacks and supports for arguments. It builds on
previous work by Amgoud, Ben-Naim et. al. We study the various characteristics
of acceptability semantics that have been introduced in these works, and
introduce the notion of a modular acceptability semantics. A semantics is
modular if it cleanly separates aggregation of attacking and supporting
arguments (for a given argument $a$) from the computation of their influence on
$a$'s initial weight.
  We show that the various semantics for bipolar argumentation graphs from the
literature may be analysed as a composition of an aggregation function with an
influence function. Based on this modular framework, we prove general
convergence and divergence theorems. We demonstrate that all well-behaved
modular acceptability semantics converge for all acyclic graphs and that no
sum-based semantics can converge for all graphs. In particular, we show
divergence of Euler-based semantics (Amgoud et al.) for certain cyclic graphs.
Further, we provide the first semantics for bipolar weighted graphs that
converges for all graphs.

estimation not on the original data but on appropriately transformed data.
Then, the density for the original data can be obtained by a change of

problems can be cured by introducing a mixing between the singlet scalar $s$

a specific example, we consider the dark matter (DM) search in the $t \bar{t} +

improved task performance when using psychologically motivated weighting
functions, which adjust the count to privilege n-grams featuring more salient

to appear in harmonic pattern discovery algorithms, which attempt to discover
the most recurrent chord progressions in complex polyphonic corpora. This study
examines whether psychologically-motivated weighting functions can improve
harmonic pattern discovery algorithms. Models using various n-gram selection

has attracted a significant attention to the Massively Parallel Computation
(MPC) model over the past few years, especially on graph problems. In this
work, we consider symmetry breaking problems of maximal independent set (MIS)
and maximal matching (MM), which are among the most intensively studied
problems in distributed/parallel computing, in MPC.
  These problems are known to admit efficient MPC algorithms if the space per
machine is near-linear in $n$, the number of vertices in the graph. This space
requirement however, as observed in the literature, is often significantly
larger than we can afford; especially when the input graph is sparse. In a
sharp contrast, in the truly sublinear regime of $n^{1-\Omega(1)}$ space per
machine, all the known algorithms take $\log^{\Omega(1)} n$ rounds which is
considered inefficient.
  Motivated by this shortcoming, we parametrize our algorithms by the
arboricity $\alpha$ of the input graph, which is a well-received measure of its
sparsity. We show that both MIS and MM admit $O(\sqrt{\log \alpha}\cdot\log\log
\alpha + \log^2\log n)$ round algorithms using $O(n^\epsilon)$ space per
machine for any constant $\epsilon \in (0, 1)$ and using $\widetilde{O}(m)$
total space. Therefore, for the wide range of sparse graphs with small
arboricity---such as minor-free graphs, bounded-genus graphs or bounded
treewidth graphs---we get an $O(\log^2 \log n)$ round algorithm which
exponentially improves prior algorithms.
  By known reductions, our results also imply a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation of
maximum cardinality matching, a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation of maximum
weighted matching, and a 2-approximation of minimum vertex cover with
essentially the same round complexity and memory requirements.

connects to your favourite text editor and provides services that require a
fine-grained understanding of the programming language syntax and static
semantics: instant feedback on warnings and errors, autocompletion, `type of
the code under the cursor', `go to definition', etc.
  Language servers need to handle incomplete and partially-incorrect programs,
and try to be incremental to minimize recomputation after small editing
actions. Merlin was built by carefully adapting the existing tools (the
OCamllex lexer and Menhir parser generators) to better support incrementality,
incompleteness and error handling. These extensions are elegant and general, as
demonstrated by the interesting, unplanned uses that the OCaml community found
for them. They could be adapted to other frontends -- in any language.
  Besides incrementality, we discuss the way Merlin communicates with editors,
describe the design decisions that went into some demanding features and report
on some of the non-apparent difficulties in building good editor support,
emerging from expressive programming languages or frustrating tooling
ecosystems.

improve overall computation efficiency or boost the performance of individual
tasks, under the assumption that those tasks are correlated and complementary
to each other. However, the relationships between the tasks are complicated in
practice, especially when the number of involved tasks scales up. When two
tasks are of weak relevance, they may compete or even distract each other
during joint training of shared parameters, and as a consequence undermine the
learning of all the tasks. This will raise destructive interference which
decreases learning efficiency of shared parameters and lead to low quality loss
local optimum w.r.t. shared parameters. To address the this problem, we propose
a general modulation module, which can be inserted into any convolutional
neural network architecture, to encourage the coupling and feature sharing of
relevant tasks while disentangling the learning of irrelevant tasks with minor
parameters addition. Equipped with this module, gradient directions from
different tasks can be enforced to be consistent for those shared parameters,
which benefits multi-task joint training. The module is end-to-end learnable
without ad-hoc design for specific tasks, and can naturally handle many tasks
at the same time. We apply our approach on two retrieval tasks, face retrieval
on the CelebA dataset [1] and product retrieval on the UT-Zappos50K dataset [2,

focus on the problem of estimating the out-of-cluster (OOC) prediction loss
given an approximate clustering with probabilistic error rate $p_0$.
Traditional cross-validation techniques exhibit significant empirical bias in
this setting, and the few attempts to estimate and correct for these effects
are intractable on larger datasets. Further, no previous work has been able to
characterize the conditions under which these empirical effects occur, and if
they do, what properties they have. We precisely answer these questions by
providing theoretical properties which hold in various settings, and prove that
expected out-of-cluster loss behavior rapidly decays with even minor clustering
errors. Fortunately, we are able to leverage these same properties to construct
hypothesis tests and scalable estimators necessary for correcting the problem.
Empirical results on benchmark datasets validate our theoretical results and
demonstrate how scaling techniques provide solutions to new classes of

tracks, namely the pursuit of network compactness and robustness, can be merged

functions to defend against adversarial examples. We also propose to train
robust neural networks by using adaptive quantization techniques for the

framework to combine observations from individual sources for two purposes: to
produce a detection statistic for the whole ensemble of sources within a
search, and to estimate the hyperparameters of the underlying distribution of
pulsar ellipticities. Both purposes require us to assume some functional form
of the ellipticity distribution, and as a proof of principle we take two toy

incorporating a common parameterized prior ellipticity distribution we can be
more efficient at detecting gravitational waves from the whole ensemble of

motivated recent investigation of practical techniques to improve code layout
at both compile time and link time. Although post-link optimizers had some
success in the past, no recent work has explored their benefits in the context

  In this paper, we present BOLT, a post-link optimizer built on top of the

of real-world applications even for highly optimized binaries built with both
feedback-driven optimizations (FDO) and link-time optimizations (LTO). We
demonstrate that post-link performance improvements are complementary to
conventional compiler optimizations, even when the latter are done at a

BOLT on both Facebook data-center workloads and open-source compilers. For
data-center applications, BOLT achieves up to 8.0% performance speedups on top
of profile-guided function reordering and LTO. For the GCC and Clang compilers,
our evaluation shows that BOLT speeds up their binaries by up to 20.4% on top

two modes of movement: it can either diffuse, by moving with equal probability

improvement, since they use isotropic kernels to perform 3D convolutions

the fully convolutional structural methods achieve good performance for

design a 3D ResNet encoder to extract 3D features from prostate scans, and then
develop the decoder, which is composed of a multi-scale 3D global convolutional
block and a 3D boundary refinement block, to address the classification and
localization issues simultaneously for volumetric segmentation. Additionally,
we combine the encoder-decoder segmentation network with an adversarial network
in the training phrase to enforce the contiguity of long-range spatial
predictions. Throughout the proposed model, we use anisotropic convolutional
processing for better feature learning on prostate MR scans. We evaluated our
3D GCA-Net model on two public prostate MR datasets and achieved

series of Efimov-like quasibound states in an attractive Coulomb potential. In
an applied magnetic field, these quasibound states can become bound states
around the Dirac point, due to the energy gap between two successive Landau
levels. Through the calculation of the energy spectrum directly, we show that
there exists a crossover from the Landau level to the bound state as the
magnetic field increases. Because of the decreasing magnetic length, the deep
quasibound states are pushed up to the Dirac point relatively and transformed
into bound states gradually. Furthermore, the magnetic positions of the
emerging bound states in the crossovers obey a geometric scaling law, which can
be regarded as an analogy of the radial law in the Efimov effect. We extend our
analysis to massless three-component fermions, which also demonstrate this
phenomenon. Our results show the universality of fermions with linear

made rapid progress in recent years thanks to the Segmented Coronagraph Design
and Analysis (SCDA) initiative led by the Exoplanet Exploration Program at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. As a result, several types of
high-performance designs have emerged that make use of dual deformable mirrors
to (1) correct for optical aberrations and (2) suppress diffracted starlight
from obstructions and discontinuities in the telescope pupil. However, the
algorithms used to compute the optimal deformable mirror surface tend to be
computationally intensive, prohibiting large scale design surveys. Here, we
utilize the Fast Linearized Coronagraph Optimizer (FALCO), a tool that allows
for rapid optimization of deformable mirror shapes, to explore trade-offs in
coronagraph designs for obstructed and segmented space telescopes. We compare
designs for representative shaped pupil Lyot and vortex coronagraphs, two of
the most promising concepts for the LUVOIR space mission concept. We analyze
the optical performance of each design, including their throughput and ability
to passively suppress light from partially resolved stars in the presence of
low-order aberrations. Our main result is that deformable mirror based
apodization can sufficiently suppress diffraction from support struts and
inter-segment gaps whose widths are on the order of $\sim$0.1% of the primary
mirror diameter to detect Earth-sized planets within a few tens of
milliarcseconds from the star.

ten orders of magnitude fainter than the host star at small angular separation.
Coronagraphs with microdot apodizers achieve the theoretical performance needed
to image Earth-like planets with a range of possible telescope designs,
including those with obscured and segmented pupils. A test microdot apodizer
with various bulk patterns (step functions, gradients, and sinusoids) and 4
different dot sizes (3, 5, 7, and 10 $\mu$m) made of small chrome squares on
anti-reflective glass was characterized with microscopy, optical laser
interferometry, as well as transmission and reflectance measurements at
wavelengths of 600 and 800 nm. Microscopy revealed the microdots were
fabricated to high precision. Results from laser interferometry showed that the
phase shifts observed in reflection vary with the local microdot fill factor.
Transmission measurements showed that microdot fill factor and transmission
were linearly related for dot sizes >5 $\mu$m. However, anomalously high
transmittance was measured when the dot size is <5x the wavelength and the fill
factor is approximately 50%, where the microdot pattern becomes periodic. The
transmission excess is not as prominent in the case of larger dot sizes
suggesting that it is likely to be caused by the interaction between the
incident field and electronic resonances in the surface of the metallic
microdots. We used our empirical models of the microdot apodizers to optimize a
second generation of reflective apodizer designs and confirmed that the

internal state provides a summary of the observed sequence, to facilitate
accurate predictions and decision-making. At the same time, specifying and
training RNNs is notoriously tricky, particularly as the common strategy to
approximate gradients back in time, called truncated Back-prop Through Time
(BPTT), can be sensitive to the truncation window. Further,
domain-expertise--which can usually help constrain the function class and so
improve trainability--can be difficult to incorporate into complex recurrent
units used within RNNs. In this work, we explore how to use multi-step
predictions to constrain the RNN and incorporate prior knowledge. In
particular, we revisit the idea of using predictions to construct state and
ask: does constraining (parts of) the state to consist of predictions about the
future improve RNN trainability? We formulate a novel RNN architecture, called
a General Value Function Network (GVFN), where each internal state component
corresponds to a prediction about the future represented as a value function.
We first provide an objective for optimizing GVFNs, and derive several
algorithms to optimize this objective. We then show that GVFNs are more robust
to the truncation level, in many cases only requiring one-step gradient
updates.

ADAM's $\beta_1$ is set to the most commonly used value: $\beta_1 = 0.9$,
indicating the importance of tuning the hyperparameters of ADAM to get better

analyzed carefully. The calculated results demonstrate that the 4$f$ electrons
in the $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, and $\delta$ phases are all correlated with
heavily remormalized electron masses. In the $\alpha$ phase, the 4$f$ electrons
tend to be itinerant, which cause strong hybridization between the 4$f$ and
$spd$ bands and remarkable 4$f$ valence state fluctuation. While for the other
phases, the 4$f$ electrons are close to be localized. Our calculated results
support the Kondo volume collapse scenario for the cerium $\alpha-\gamma$

assumptions as constraints on the possible strategies that the environment can
have in order to respond to the agent's actions. Such constraints may be given
in the form of a planning domain (or action theory), as linear-time formulas
over infinite or finite runs, or as a combination of the two. We argue though
that not all assumption specifications are meaningful: they need to be
consistent, which means that there must exist an environment strategy
fulfilling the assumption in spite of the agent actions. For such assumptions,
we study how to do synthesis/planning for agent goals, ranging from a classical
reachability to goal on traces specified in \LTL and \LTLf/\LDLf,
characterizing the problem both mathematically and algorithmically.

time-invariant (LTI) systems subject to attacks on the sensors and the

vulnerabilities of the communication links from sensors to the controller and
from the controller to actuators. The observer and the controller formulation
under the attack are derived. Thereafter, By leveraging Lyapunov functional
methods, it is shown that exponential mean-square stability of the system under

high frequency details such as tiny textures. However, most of the

areas, causing the output image to be blurred. We propose an attention-based
approach to give a discrimination between texture areas and smooth areas. After
the positions of high frequency details are located, high frequency
compensation is carried out. This approach can incorporate with previously
proposed SISR networks. By providing high frequency enhancement, better
performance and visual effect are achieved. We also propose our own SISR
network composed of DenseRes blocks. The block provides an effective way to
combine the low level features and high level features. Extensive benchmark
evaluation shows that our proposed method achieves significant improvement over

low-inclination comets. In a configuration formed by an interior giant planet
and an exterior massive debris disk, where the mass is accounted for by the 50
largest objects in the disk, the strongest mean motion resonances of the giant,
located along the belt, are replenished with new material (test particles) due
to the influence of the 50 massive objects. Once in resonance, slow chaotic
diffusion stirs the orbital elements of the cometary nuclei enough to encounter
the giant and to be scattered by it. When the disk is massive enough, both
resonant and non-resonant particles are stirred quickly to encounter the giant
and form an scattered disk component, greatly increasing the rate for the
delivery of cometary material to the inner part of the system. This mechanism
is applicable both to the solar system and extrasolar systems in general.
Preliminary results, using a disk as massive as the classical Kuiper belt,
indicate that the mechanism here proposed can account for about a tenth of the
required injection rate to maintain the population of ecliptic comets in steady
state. In a more massive belt of 0.25 M$_\oplus$, an estimated rate of around
0.6 new comets per year is found. Such a high rate would pose a serious risk
for the habitability of rocky interior planets, yet would resemble the late
heavy bombardment that was present in the early solar system.

case was first conjectured by Miyawaki and proved by Ikeda for Siegel cusp
forms. Since then, such a lift for Hermitian modular forms was constructed by
Atobe and Kojima , and for half-integral weight Siegel cusp forms by Hayashida,
and we constructed Miyawaki type lift for ${\rm GSpin}(2,10)$. Recently Ikeda
and Yamana generalized Ikeda type construction and accordingly did Miyawaki
type lift for Hilbert cusp forms in a remarkable way. In all these works, a
construction of Miyawaki type lift takes two steps as follows: First, construct
Ikeda type lift on a bigger group from an elliptic cusp form, and then define a
certain integral on a block diagonal element which is an analogue of pull-back
formula studied by Garrett for Siegel Eisenstein series. If the integral is
non-vanishing, we show that it is a Hecke eigen cusp form, and it is the
Miyawaki type lift. The question of non-vanishing of the integral was left
open. In this paper, we show the non-vanishing for certain special cases.

determine the stability,structure and chirality of many molecular and
supramolecular aggregates weakly adsorbed on solid surfaces.Yet the inherent
complexity of these systems makes their experimental study at the molecular
level very challenging.Small alcohols adsorbed on metal surfaces have become a
useful model system to gain fundamental insight into the interplay of such
molecule-surface and molecule-molecule interactions.Here, through a combination
of scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory,we compare and
contrast the adsorption and self-assembly of a range of small alcohols from
methanol to butanol on Au(111).We find that that longer chained alcohols prefer
to form zigzag chains held together by extended H-bonded networks between
adjacent molecules.When alcohols bind to a metal surface datively via one of
the two lone electron pairs of the oxygen atom they become chiral.Therefore,the
chain structures are formed by a H-bonded network between adjacent molecules
with alternating adsorbed chirality.These chain structures accommodate longer
alkyl tails through larger unit cells, while the position of the hydroxyl group
within the alcohol molecule can produce denser unit cells that maximize
intermolecular interactions.Interestingly,when intrinsic chirality is
introduced into the molecule as in the case of 2-butanol the assembly changes
completely and square packing structures with chiral pockets are observed. This
is rationalized by the fact that the intrinsic chirality of the molecule
directs the chirality of the adsorbed hydroxyl group meaning that heterochiral
chain structures cannot form.Overall this study provides a general framework
for understanding the effect of simple alcohol molecular adstructures on
H-bonded aggregates and paves the way for rationalizing 2D chiral
supramolecular assembly.

type active galaxies which jets are aligned at large angles to the line of
sight. A few radio galaxies of this type have been discovered to emit GeV-TeV
gamma-rays. We consider a scenario which naturally explains the very high
energy gamma-ray emission at large angles to the jet axis. It is proposed that
two emission regions are present in the jet at this same moment. The inner
region (blob I), moves with the large Lorentz factor, producing radiation
strongly collimated along the jet axis, as observed in BL Lac type blazars. On
the other hand, the outer region (blob II), which moves with the mild Lorentz
factor, contains isotropically distributed relativistic electrons in the blob
reference frame. These electrons up-scatter mono-directional soft radiation
from the blob I preferentially in the direction opposite to the jet motion.
Therefore, gamma-rays, produced in the blob II, can be emitted at a relatively
large angles to the jet axis in the observer's reference frame. We analyze the
basic emission features of such external blob radiation model. The example
modeling of the emission from the FR I type radio galaxy, NGC 1275, is

those of the ${\Lambda}$CDM models, they must be unable to match the

compact binary coalescences (CBCs) have been detected. As the sensitivities and
bandwidths of the detectors improve and new detectors join the network, many
more sources are expected to be detected. The goal will not only be to find as
many sources as possible in the data but to understand the dynamics of the
sources much more precisely. Standard searches are currently restricted to a
smaller parameter space which assumes aligned spins. Construction of a larger
and denser parameter space, and optimising the resultant increase in false
alarms, pose a serious computational challenge. We present here a two-stage
hierarchical strategy to search for CBCs in data from a network of detectors
and demonstrate the computational advantage in real life scenario by
introducing it in the standard {\tt PyCBC} pipeline with the usual restricted
parameter space. With this strategy, in simulated data containing stationary
Gaussian noise, we obtain a computational gain of $\sim 20$ over the flat
search. In real data, we expect the computational gain up to a factor of few.
This saving in the computational effort will, in turn, allow us to search for
precessing binaries. Freeing up computation time for the regular analyses will
provide more options to search for sources of different kinds and to fulfil the
never-ending urge for extracting more science out of the data with limited

processing of big data generated by sensors installed in electric meters. On
one hand, this data is essentially required for intelligent decision making by
smart grid but on the other hand storage, transmission and processing of that
huge amount of data is also a challenge. Present approaches to compress this
information have only relied on the traditional matrix decomposition techniques
benefitting from low number of principal components to represent the entire
data. This paper proposes a cascaded data compression technique that blends
three different methods in order to achieve high compression rate for efficient
storage and transmission. In the first and second stages, two lossy data
compression techniques are used, namely Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and
Normalization; Third stage achieves further compression by using the technique
of Sparsity Encoding (SE) which is a lossless compression technique but only
having appreciable benefits for sparse data sets. Our simulation results show
that the combined use of the 3 techniques achieves data compression ratio to be
15% higher than state of the art SVD for small, sparse datasets and up to 28%
higher in large, non-sparse datasets with acceptable Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

occurrence of gap-edge states even for stronger couplings. Moreover, we connect
the localization behavior of a given eigenstate to its energy, thus providing a
quantitative connection between the real-space structure of the chain and its

symmetries, of how the energy spectra of binary chains are formed. The insights
gained allow for a systematic analysis of aperiodic binary chains and offers a
pathway to control structurally induced edge states.

sufficiently detailed level of analysis. We propose a new method for estimating
the parameters of a planar elliptic shape based on a single photon-limited,
low-resolution image. Our technique incorporates the effects of several
elements - point-spread function, discretisation step, quantisation step, and
photon noise - into a single cohesive and manageable statistical model. While
we concentrate on the particular task of estimating the parameters of elliptic
shapes, our ideas and methods have a much broader scope and can be used to
address the problem of estimating the parameters of an arbitrary parametrically
representable planar shape. Comprehensive experimental results on simulated and
real imagery demonstrate that our approach yields parameter estimates with
unprecedented accuracy. Furthermore, our method supplies a parameter covariance
matrix as a measure of uncertainty for the estimated parameters, as well as a
planar confidence region as a means for visualising the parameter uncertainty.
The mathematical model developed in this paper may prove useful in a variety of
disciplines which operate with imagery at the limits of resolution.

higher Hawking temperatures would give rise to an inflation of the entropic

analysis of algorithms in a distributed shared memory setting, which is
surprisingly different from the classical online setting. In fact, in a
distributed shared memory setting, we find a counter-example to the theorem
concerning classical randomized online algorithms which shows that, if there is
a $c$-competitive randomized algorithm against an adaptive offline adversary,
then there is a $c$-competitive deterministic algorithm [Ben-David, Borodin,
Karp, Tardos, Wigderson, 1994]. In a distributed setting, there is additional
lack of knowledge concerning what the other processes have done. There is also
additional power for the adversary, having control of the scheduler which
decides when each process is allowed to take steps.
  We consider the list accessing problem, which is a benchmark problem for
sequential online algorithms. In the distributed version of this problem, each
process has its own finite sequence of requests to a shared list. The scheduler
arises as a major issue in its competitive analysis. We introduce two different
adversaries, which differ in how they are allowed to schedule processes, and
use them to perform competitive analysis of distributed list accessing. We
prove tight upper and lower bounds on combinatorial properties of merges of the
request sequences, which we use in the analysis. Our analysis shows that the
effects of the adversarial scheduler can be quite significant, dominating the
usual quality loss due to lack of information about the future.

different freezeout schemes that differ in the way strangeness is treated: i.
unified freezeout for all hadrons in complete thermal equilibrium (1FO), ii.
unified freezeout for all hadrons with an additional parameter $\gamma_S$ which
accounts for possible out-of-equilibrium production of strangeness
(1FO$+\gamma_S$), and iii. separate freezeout for hadrons with and without
strangeness content (2FO). Unlike in heavy ion collisions where 2FO performs
best in describing the mean hadron yields as well as the transverse momentum

maps of the unit square to itself. Interesting dynamics arise on the invariant
diagonal, on which a two-parameter family of bimodal interval maps exhibits
periodic orbits and chaos. While the fixed point $b$ corresponding to a Nash
equilibrium of such map $f$ is usually repelling, it is globally Cesaro
attracting on the diagonal, that is, \[
\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac1n\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}f^k(x)=b \] for every $x$ in the
minimal invariant interval. This solves a known open question whether there
exists a nontrivial smooth map other than $x\mapsto axe^{-x}$ with centers of
mass of all periodic orbits coinciding. We also study the dependence of the
dynamics on the two parameters.

first main result is a 'recovery theorem' showing that the magnitude cohomology
ring of a finite metric space completely determines the space itself. The
magnitude cohomology ring is non-commutative in general, for example when
applied to finite metric spaces, but in some settings it is commutative, for

this situation by proving that the magnitude cohomology ring of an enriched

velocities of changing the position of the observer, the mode frequency and
angular degree, as well as of changing the region of the disk where the
elements are concentrated. We find that for integrations over the full disc, in
the outermost layers the radial velocity is generally dominated by the acoustic
waves, showing a rapid increase in amplitude. The most significant
depth-variations in the radial velocity phase are seen for observers directed
towards the equator and for even degree modes with frequencies close to, or
above the acoustic cutoff. Comparison between the radial velocities obtained
for spots of elements located around the magnetic poles and around the magnetic
equator, shows that these present distinct amplitude-phase relations,
resembling some of the differences seen in the observations. Finally, we

incorporate additional information into the recommendation process such as
explicit trust scores that are assigned by users to others or implicit trust

extraction and decision processes, limiting their value in clinical diagnosis.
In this work, we propose a 3D convolutional generative model for automatic
classification of images from patients with cardiac diseases associated with
structural remodeling. The model leverages interpretable task-specific anatomic
patterns learned from 3D segmentations. It further allows to visualise and
quantify the learned pathology-specific remodeling patterns in the original

categorization of healthy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy subjects when tested
on unseen MR images from our own multi-centre dataset (100%) as well on the

in destroying O$_2$, whereas in the upper atmosphere, most O$_2$ is formed
abiotically via CO$_2$ photolysis. The O$_2$ bistability found by Goldblatt et
al. (2006) is not observed in our calculations likely due to our detailed

biosphere that produces O$_2$ is unique. Mixing, CH$_4$ fluxes, ocean

over the links of the network with local interactions depending on the node
occupation probabilities. The model is highly versatile, as the motion of the
walkers can be fed on topological properties of the nodes, such as their
degree, while any general nonlinear function of the occupation probability of a
node can be considered as local reaction term. In addition to this, the
relative strength of reaction and relocation can be tuned at will, depending on
the specific application being examined. We derive an analytical expression for
the occupation probability of the walkers at equilibrium in the most general
case. We show that it depends on different order derivatives of the local
reaction functions and not only on the degree of a node, but also on the
average degree of its neighbours at various distances. For such a reason,
reactive random walkers are very sensitive to the structure of a network and
are a powerful way to detect network properties such as symmetries or
degree-degree correlations. As possible applications, we first discuss how the
occupation probability of reactive random walkers can be used to define novel
measures of functional centrality for the nodes of a network. We then
illustrate how network components with the same symmetries can be revealed by
tracking the evolution of reactive walkers. Finally, we show that the dynamics

that assortative and disassortative networks can be classified by quantitative

this space, quotiented by a closure constraint forcing the sum of those
3-vectors to vanish, we obtain the phase space for Lorentzian polyhedra with
$N$ faces whose normal vectors are space-like, up to Lorentz transformations.
We identify a generating set of $SU(1,1)$-invariant observables, whose flow by
the Poisson bracket generate both area-preserving and area-changing
deformations. We further show that the area-preserving observables form a
$\mathfrak{gl}_{N}(\mathbb{R})$ Lie algebra and that they generate a
$GL_{N}(\mathbb{R})$ action on Lorentzian polyhedra at fixed total area. That
action is cyclic and all Lorentzian polyhedra can be obtained from a totally
squashed polyhedron (with only two non-trivial faces) by a $GL_{N}(\mathbb{R})$
transformation. All those features carry on to the quantum level, where quantum
Lorentzian polyhedra are defined as $SU(1,1)$ intertwiners between unitary

$SU(1,1)$-intertwiners are the building blocks of spin network states in loop

  Experiments",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Software Engineering (SE) experiments are traditionally analyzed with
statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVAs, etc.) that assume equally spread data
across treatments (i.e., the homogeneity of variances assumption). Differences
across treatments' variances in SE are not seen as an opportunity to gain
insights on technology performance, but instead, as a hindrance to analyze the
data. We have studied the role of variance in mature experimental disciplines
such as medicine. We illustrate the extent to which variance may inform on
technology performance by means of simulation. We analyze a real-life
industrial experiment on Test-Driven Development (TDD) where variance may
impact technology desirability. Evaluating the performance of technologies just
based on means-as traditionally done in SE-may be misleading. Technologies that
make developers resemble more to each other (i.e., technologies with smaller
variances) may be more suitable if the aim is minimizing the risk of adopting
them in real practice.

Even for small nonlinearity, the system reaches the amplification threshold for
weak driving strength, leading to low-power phonon lasing. This amplifier can

track-based jets in central Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 2.76$
TeV. The set of jet shapes includes the first radial moment or angularity, $g$;
the momentum dispersion, $p_{\rm T}D$; and the difference between the leading
and sub-leading constituent track transverse momentum, $LeSub$. These
observables provide complementary information on the jet fragmentation and can
constrain different aspects of the theoretical description of jet-medium
interactions. The jet shapes were measured for a small resolution parameter $R
= 0.2$ and were fully corrected to particle level. The observed jet shape
modifications indicate that in-medium fragmentation is harder and more
collimated than vacuum fragmentation as obtained by PYTHIA calculations, which
were validated with the measurements of the jet shapes in proton-proton
collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV. The comparison of the measured distributions
to templates for quark and gluon-initiated jets indicates that in-medium
fragmentation resembles that of quark jets in vacuum. We further argue that the
observed modifications are not consistent with a totally coherent energy loss
picture where the jet loses energy as a single colour charge, suggesting that
the medium resolves the jet structure at the angular scales probed by our
measurements ($R=0.2$). Furthermore, we observe that small-$R$ jets can help to
isolate purely energy loss effects from other effects that contribute to the
modifications of the jet shower in medium such as the correlated background or
medium response.

systems with full (3+1)D numerical relativity simulations using consistent
initial conditions, i.e., setups which are in agreement with the Einstein
equations and with the equations of general relativistic hydrodynamics in
equilibrium. Overall, our simulations cover two different equations of state
(EOSs), two different spin configurations, and three to four different initial
eccentricities for each pairing of EOS and spin. We extract from the simulated
waveforms the frequency of the f-mode oscillations induced during close
encounters before the merger of the two stars. The extracted frequency is in
good agreement with f-mode oscillations of individual stars for the
irrotational cases, which allows an independent measure of the supranuclear
equation of state not accessible for binaries on quasi-circular orbits. The
energy stored in these f-mode oscillations can be as large as $10^{-3}M_\odot
\sim 10^{51}$ erg, even with a soft EOS. In order to estimate the stored
energy, we also examine the effects of mode mixing due to the stars' offset
from the origin on the f-mode contribution to the GW signal. While in general
(eccentric) neutron star mergers produce bright electromagnetic counterparts,
we find that the luminosity decreases when the eccentricity becomes too large,
due to a decrease of the ejecta mass. Finally, the use of consistent initial
configurations also allows us to produce high-quality waveforms for different
eccentricities which can be used as a testbed for waveform model development of
highly eccentric binary neutron star systems.

accepted theory---to test. For convincing conclusions, analysis methods are
needed which offer an unambiguous comparison between data and theory while
allowing reliable estimates of uncertainties. The Matrix Element Method (MEM)
is a Maximum Likelihood method which is especially tailored for signal searches
and parameter estimation at colliders. The MEM has proven to be beneficial due
to optimal use of the available information and a clean statistical
interpretation of the results. But it has a big drawback: In its original
formulation, the likelihood calculation is intrinsically limited to the leading
perturbative order in the coupling. Higher-order corrections improve the
accuracy of theoretical predictions and allow for unambiguous field-theoretical
interpretation of the extracted information. In this work, the MEM
incorporating corrections of next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD by defining
event weights suited for the likelihood calculation is presented for the first
time. These weights also enable the generation of unweighted events following
the cross section calculated at NLO accuracy. The method is demonstrated for
top-quark events. The top-quark mass is determined with the MEM at NLO accuracy
from the generated events. The extracted estimators are in agreement with the
input values from the event generation. Repeating the mass determinations from
the same events, without NLO corrections in the predictions, results in biased
estimators. These shifts may not be accounted for by estimated theoretical
uncertainties rendering the estimation of the theoretical uncertainties
unreliable in the leading-order analysis. The results emphasise the importance
of the inclusion of NLO corrections into the MEM.

(Lieb-Liniger model). Starting from a recently conjectured expression for the
expectation value of vertex operators in the sinh-Gordon field theory, we
derive explicit analytic expressions for the one-point $K$-body correlation
functions $\langle (\Psi^\dagger)^K(\Psi)^K\rangle$ in the Lieb-Liniger gas,
for arbitrary integer $K$. These are valid for all excited states in the
thermodynamic limit, including thermal states, generalized Gibbs ensembles and
non-equilibrium steady states arising in transport settings. Our formulas
display several physically interesting applications: most prominently, they
allow us to compute the full counting statistics for the particle-number
fluctuations in a short interval. Furthermore, combining our findings with the
recently introduced generalized hydrodynamics, we are able to study multi-point
correlation functions at the Eulerian scale in non-homogeneous settings. Our
results complement previous studies in the literature and provide a full
solution to the problem of computing one-point functions in the Lieb Liniger
model.

replacement of parts of a graph by more general structural patterns in order to
reduce its description length. It notably provides interesting exploration
tools for the study of real, large-scale, and complex graphs which cannot be
grasped at first glance. This article proposes a framework for the compression
of temporal graphs, that is for the compression of graphs that evolve with
time. This framework first builds on a simple and limited scheme, exploiting
structural equivalence for the lossless compression of static graphs, then
generalises it to the lossy compression of link streams, a recent formalism for
the study of temporal graphs. Such generalisation relies on the natural
extension of (bidimensional) relational data by the addition of a third
temporal dimension. Moreover, we introduce an information-theoretic measure to
quantify and to control the information that is lost during compression, as
well as an algebraic characterisation of the space of possible compression
patterns to enhance the expressiveness of the initial compression scheme. These
contributions lead to the definition of a combinatorial optimisation problem,
that is the Lossy Multistream Compression Problem, for which we provide an
exact algorithm.

planned cosmological surveys to detect new physics. Standard methods imply
either the need for many N-body simulations in order to obtain an accurate
estimate, or a precise theoretical model. We combine these approaches by
constructing a likelihood function conditioned on simulated and theoretical
covariances, consistently propagating noise from the finite number of
simulations and uncertainty in the theoretical model itself using an
informative Inverse-Wishart prior. Unlike standard methods, our approach allows
the required number of simulations to be less than the number of summary
statistics. We recover the linear 'shrinkage' covariance estimator in the
context of a Bayesian data model, and test our marginal likelihood on simulated
mock power spectrum estimates. We conduct a thorough investigation into the
impact of prior confidence in different choices of covariance models on the
quality of model fits and parameter variances. In a simplified setting we find
that the number of simulations required can be reduced if one is willing to
accept a mild degradation in the quality of model fits, finding that even
weakly informative priors can help to reduce the simulation requirements. We
identify the correlation matrix of the summary statistics as a key quantity
requiring careful modelling. Our approach can be easily generalized to any
covariance model or set of summary statistics, and elucidates the role of
hybrid estimators in cosmological inference.

negative bulk cosmological constant. The solution is characterised by the
presence of a normal gravity regime around our brane and an anti-gravitating

stress-dependent steady-state slip pulse solutions, which are unstable in the

action of the Higgs-like scalar $\phi$ in the presence of: 1) non-minimal
coupling ($\xi$) and 2) quadratic curvature terms. The latter are generated at
the quantum level with $\phi$-dependent couplings ($\tilde\alpha$) even if
their tree-level couplings ($\alpha$) are tuned to zero. Therefore, the
potential always depends on both Higgs field $\phi$ and scalaron $\rho$, hence
multi-field inflation is a quantum consequence. The effects of the quantum
(one- and two-loop) corrections on the potential $\hat W(\phi,\rho)$ and on the
spectral index are discussed, showing that the Starobinsky-Higgs model is in
general stable in their presence. Two special cases are also considered: first,
for a large $\xi$ in the quantum action one can integrate $\phi$ and generate a
""refined"" Starobinsky model which contains additional terms $\xi^2 R^2\ln^p
(\xi \vert R\vert/\mu^2)$, $p=1,2$ ($\mu$ is the subtraction scale). These
generate corrections linear in the scalaron to the ""usual"" Starobinsky

the so-called Partial Volume Effect (PVE) due to spatial resolution

more than one tissue are not correctly estimated. Magnetic Resonance
Fingerprinting (MRF) is not an exception. The existing methods addressing PVE
are neither scalable nor accurate. We propose to formulate the recovery of
multiple tissues per voxel as a nonconvex constrained least-squares
minimisation problem. To solve this problem, we develop a memory efficient,
greedy approximate projected gradient descent algorithm, dubbed GAP-MRF. Our
method adaptively finds the regions of interest on the manifold of fingerprints
defined by the MRF sequence. We generalise our method to compensate for phase
errors appearing in the model, using an alternating minimisation approach. We
show, through simulations on synthetic data with PVE, that our algorithm
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach is validated on the EUROSPIN

potential emergent phases. Here, we show that electronic interaction causes
Stoner ferromagnetic instability in the DSS while the bulk remains
non-magnetic, which together with spin-orbit coupling drive the surface states

the original recommendation logs, which provide a unique insight into many

researchers to conduct various analyses about a real-world recommender system.
This includes the evaluation of meta-learning approaches for predicting
algorithm performance. In this paper, we summarise the key features of this

model-based and learning-based. The former - best represented by sparse coding
techniques - strive to exploit intrinsic prior knowledge about the unknown
high-resolution images; while the latter - popularized by recently developed
deep learning techniques - leverage external image prior from some training
dataset. It is natural to explore their middle ground and pursue a hybrid image
prior capable of achieving the best in both worlds. In this paper, we propose a
systematic approach of achieving this goal called Structured Analysis Sparse
Coding (SASC). Specifically, a structured sparse prior is learned from
extrinsic training data via a deep convolutional neural network (in a similar
way to previous learning-based approaches); meantime another structured sparse
prior is internally estimated from the input observation image (similar to
previous model-based approaches). Two structured sparse priors will then be
combined to produce a hybrid prior incorporating the knowledge from both
domains. To manage the computational complexity, we have developed a novel
framework of implementing hybrid structured sparse coding processes by deep
convolutional neural networks. Experimental results show that the proposed
hybrid image restoration method performs comparably with and often better than
the current state-of-the-art techniques.

Comments and Suggestions are welcome!",,"10.1088/1367-2630/aaf01a",,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nanotubular molecular self-aggregates are characterized by a high degree of
symmetry and they are fundamental systems for light-harvesting and energy
transport. While coherent effects are thought to be at the basis of their high
efficiency, the relationship between structure, coherence and functionality is
still an open problem. We analyze natural nanotubes present in Green Sulfur
Bacteria. We show that they have the ability to support macroscopic coherent
states, i.e. delocalized excitonic states coherently spread over many
molecules, even at room temperature.
  Specifically, assuming a canonical thermal state, in natural structures we
find a large thermal coherence length, of the order of 1000 molecules. By
comparing natural structure with other mathematical models, we show that this
macroscopic coherence cannot be explained either by the magnitude of the
nearest-neighbour coupling between the molecules, which would induce a thermal
coherence length of the order of 10 molecules, or by the presence of long-range
interactions between the molecules. Indeed we prove that the existence of
macroscopic coherent states is an emergent property of such structures due to
the interplay between geometry and cooperativity (superradiance and
super-transfer). In order to prove this, we give evidence that the lowest part
of the spectrum of natural systems is determined by a cooperatively enhanced
coupling (super-transfer) between the eigenstates of modular sub-units of the
whole structure. Due to this enhanced coupling strength, the density of states
is lowered close to the ground state, thus boosting the thermal coherence
length.

viscoelastic models for which the global existence of a regular solution is
possible. Although the problem of global existence in the classic Oldroyd model
is still open, we show that by adding a non-linear contribution (proposed by
R.G. Larson in 1984), it is possible to obtain more regular and global
solutions, regardless of the size of the data (in the two-dimensional and
periodic case). Similarly, more complex appearance models such as those related
to ""pom-pom"" polymers are interesting and mathematically richer: some ""natural""
bounds on the stress make it possible to obtain global results. On the other
hand, in the last part, we show that other models clearly do not seem to fit
into this framework, and do not even seem to have a global solution in time.
These kinds of results allow to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of
such or such viscoelastic fluid models. They can thus help rheologists and
numericists to make choices with new arguments.

activity are characterized by comparatively modest X-ray luminosities and
ratios of the X-ray to bolometric luminosity. This indicates that the nature of
processes associated with magnetic-field amplification on the convective
envelope changes appreciably in the transition from small to large dynamo

strong dependence of both the dynamo number and the Rossby number on the speed

without respiration-induced motion artifacts or blurring, and the distortions

the liver containing breath-hold failures during data acquisition. The trained
network was applied to the acquired images to analyze the filtering
performance, and the intensities and contrast ratios before and after denoising

to significantly reduce the magnitude of the artifacts and blurring induced by

learning is becoming increasingly prominent for segmentation, where the lack of

concerns and ethical considerations, most medical datasets are created,
curated, and allow access only locally. Furthermore, current deep learning
methods are often suboptimal in translating anatomical knowledge between
different medical imaging modalities. Active learning can be used to select an
informed set of image samples to request for manual annotation, in order to
best utilize the limited annotation time of clinical experts for optimal
outcomes, which we focus on in this work. Our contributions herein are two
fold: (1) we enforce domain-representativeness of selected samples using a
proposed penalization scheme to maximize information at the network abstraction
layer, and (2) we propose a Borda-count based sample querying scheme for
selecting samples for segmentation. Comparative experiments with baseline

extend these types of results to the practically relevant settings with

mass accretion rate. Here, we study correlations between the radio and
unabsorbed broad-band X-ray fluxes, the latter providing good estimates of the
bolometric flux. We consider GX 339--4, the benchmark object for the main
branch of the correlation, and H1743--322, the first source found to be an
outlier of the correlation. The obtained power-law dependencies of the radio
flux on the bolometric flux have significantly different indices from those
found for the narrow X-ray bands. Also, the radio/bolometric flux correlations
for the rise of the outbursts are found to be significantly different from
those for the outburst decline. This points to a possible existence of a jet
hysteresis in the radio/X-ray source evolution, in addition to that seen in the
hardness/flux diagram of low-mass X-ray binaries. The correlation during the
rise of the outbursts is similar for both GX 339--4 and H1743--322. The
correlation for the decline of the outbursts for H1743--322 lies below that of
GX 339--4 at intermediate X-ray fluxes, whereas it approaches the standard

those observations we consider a model which predicts spontaneous violation of
CP at high temperature and restoration of CP at present temperature of the
Universe. In addition we propose a dark matter (DM) candidate that meets all
known properties of DM. Looking for a minimal model that satisfies the above
conditions leads us to extending the Standard Model (SM) of fundamental
interactions by adding a complex singlet scalar $S$. We impose the $CP$ and
$Z_2$ symmetries on the scalar potential. With the complex vacuum expectation
value of $S$ at the temperature higher than the EW phase transition, the $CP$
symmetry is spontaneously broken and a strong first-order electro-weak phase
transition is easily realized. Introducing a dimension-6 effective operator
that gives new complex contributions to the top quark mass, we show that it is
easy to yield the observed baryon asymmetry in our Universe. On the other hand,
the $CP$ and $Z_2$ symmetries are recovered after the EW phase transition so
that the present strong constraints on $CP$ violation can be satisfied and the
lighter of $\Re S$ or $\Im S$ can be the dark matter candidate. By scanning the
parameter space, we find regions where the model can explain the dark matter
relic abundance and the baryon asymmetry simultaneously while satisfying all
other experimental constraints. Finally, we discuss the explicit $CP$ symmetry
breaking in the scalar potential that can help dynamically eliminate the
domains producing the negative baryon asymmetry. It is found that this can be
achieved by a tiny explicit $CP$-violating phase of ${\cal O}(10^{-15})$.

settlements with varying degree of depravity. Although some informal
neighbourhoods have contributed to the upward mobility of the inhabitants, the
majority still lack basic services. Mexico City and the conurbation around it,
form a mega city of 21 million people that has been growing in a manner
qualified as ""highly unproductive, (that) deepens inequality, raises pollution
levels"" and contains the largest slum in the world, Neza-Chalco-Izta. Urban
reforms are now aiming to better the conditions in these slums and therefore it
is very important to have reliable measurement tools to assess the changes that
are undergoing. In this paper, we use exploratory factor analysis to define an
index of depravity in Mexico City, namely the Slum Severity Index (SSI), based
on the UN-HABITATs definition of a slum. We apply this novel approach to the
Census survey of Mexico and measure the housing deprivation levels types from
1990 - 2010. The analysis highlights high variability in housing conditions
within Mexico City. We find that the SSI decreased significantly between 1990 -
2000 due to several policy reforms, but increased between 2000 - 2010. We also
show correlations of the SSI with other social factors such as education,
health and migration. We present a validation of the SSI using Grey Level
Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features extracted from Very-High Resolution (VHR)
remote-sensed satellite images. Finally, we show that the SSI can present a
cardinally meaningful assessment of the extent of the difference in depravity

RW Aur A, has undergone visual dimming events ($\Delta V =2-3$~mag) in 2011,
2014-16, and 2017-2018. Visual and IR observations indicate a gray absorber
that moved into the line-of-sight. This dimming is also associated with changes
in the outflow. In 2017, when the optical brightness was almost 2~mag below the
long-term average we triggered a Chandra observation to measure the absorbing
column density $N_\mathrm{H}$ and to constrain dust properties and the
gas-to-dust ratio of the absorber. In 2017, the X-ray spectrum is more absorbed
than it was in the optically bright state ($N_\mathrm{H} = (4\pm 1) \times
10^{23}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$) and shows significantly more hot plasma than in
X-ray observations taken before. Also, a new emission feature at $6.63\pm0.02$
keV (statistic) $\pm0.02$ keV (systematic) appeared indicating an Fe abundance
an order of magnitude above Solar, in contrast with previous sub-Solar Fe
abundance measurements. Comparing X-ray absorbing column density $N_\mathrm{H}$
and optical extinction $A_V$, we find that either the gas-to-dust ratio in the
absorber is orders of magnitude higher than in the ISM or the absorber has
undergone significant dust evolution. Given the high column density coupled
with changes in the X-ray spectral shape, this absorber is probably located in
the inner disk. We speculate that a break-up of planetesimals or a terrestrial
planet could supply large grains causing gray absorption; some of these grains
would be accreted and enrich the stellar corona with iron which could explain
the inferred high abundance.

Data Stream Analytics framework based on a Scalable Parsimonious Network based
on Fuzzy Inference System (Scalable PANFIS), where the PANFIS evolving
algorithm is distributed over the worker nodes in the cloud to learn
large-scale data stream. Scalable PANFIS framework incorporates the active

distributed learning process to generate an initial evolving large-scale data
stream model (initial model), whereas the two model fusion methods aggregate an
initial model to generate the final model. The final model represents the
update of current large-scale data knowledge which can be used to infer future

accuracy and running time of four combinations of Scalable PANFIS and other
Spark-based built in algorithms. The results indicate that Scalable PANFIS with
AL improves the training time to be almost two times faster than Scalable
PANFIS without AL. The results also show both rule merging and the voting
mechanisms yield similar accuracy in general among Scalable PANFIS algorithms

large angles and over a wide wavelength spectrum. Although phase gradient
metasurfaces achieve this by continuously adding phase shifts in the range of 0
to 2{\pi} to the electric field with subwavelength-sized scatterers, their
performance is limited by the spatial resolution of phase modulation at the
interface. Here, we introduce a new class of metasurfaces based on a general
formulation, where the phase shifts cover less than the full 0-2{\pi} range,
offering significant advantages. More specifically, this approach allows the
realization of metasurfaces with more compact and less mutually-interacting
scatterers, thus more precise phase modulation, and advances the performance
limits of metasurfaces to domains significantly beyond those of the full
coverage phase gradient approach. Applying this concept to both plasmonic and
dielectric surfaces, we demonstrate large phase gradients resulting in
high-numerical-aperture immersion metalenses (NA=1.4) with near
diffraction-limited resolution (~0.32{\lambda}) at visible wavelengths. Our
concept enables added functionalities such as a broadband performance and
wavelength de-multiplexing on a single layer, surpassing the theoretical
cross-polarization transmission efficiency limit for single-layer plasmonic
metasurfaces, and yields 67% efficiency for dielectric metasurfaces. This work
paves the way toward realizing high-resolution flat optical elements and

zero improvement of the linguistic resource. We exemplify our point with a case
study, using real data from a task of building a verb-noun idiom dictionary. We
show that, given the choice of three systems with varying F-scores, the system

incorporate matter, we consider a restricted Weyl invariant action composed of

Period Estimation, a genetic algorithm optimised for the processing of survey
data with spurious and aliased artefacts. It uses a Bayesian Generalised
Lomb-Scargle (BGLS) fitness function designed for use with the Skycam survey
conducted at the Liverpool Telescope. We construct a set of simulated light
curves using both regular and Skycam survey cadence with four types of signal:
sinusoidal, sawtooth, symmetric eclipsing binary and eccentric eclipsing
binary. We apply GRAPE and a BGLS periodogram to this data and show that the
performance of GRAPE is superior to the periodogram on sinusoidal and sawtooth
light curves with relative hit rate improvement of 18.2% and 6.4% respectively.
The symmetric and eccentric eclipsing binary light curves have similar
performance on both methods. We show the Skycam cadence is sufficient to
correctly estimate the period for all of the sinusoidal shape light curves
although this degrades with increased non-sinusoidal shape with sawtooth,
symmetric binary and eccentric binary light curves down by 20%, 30% and 35%
respectively. The runtime of GRAPE demonstrates that light curves with more
than 500-1000 data points achieve similar performance in less computing time.
The GRAPE performance can be matched by a frequency spectrum with an
oversampled fine-tuning grid at the cost of almost doubling the runtime.
Finally, we propose improvements which will extend this method to the detection
of quasi-periodic signals and the use of multiband light curves.

As was shown previously, cancellation of the tiltmeter signal using seismometer

According to our results, a relatively small number of seismometers is likely
sufficient to perform the noise cancellation due to an almost ideal two-point

alternatively, a tiltmeter deployed under each of the two test masses of the
corner station at Hanford will be able to efficiently cancel Newtonian noise.

form is an essential step in the development of socially adept humanoid robots.
A variety of different types of signals can be used by machines to represent
and characterize actions such as RGB videos, infrared maps, and optical flow.
In particular, skeleton sequences provide a natural 3D kinematic description of
human motions and can be acquired in real time using RGB+D cameras. Moreover,
skeleton sequences are generalizable to characterize the motions of both humans
and humanoid robots. The Globally Optimal Reparameterization Algorithm (GORA)
is a novel, recently proposed algorithm for signal alignment in which signals
are reparameterized to a globally optimal universal standard timescale (UST).
Here, we introduce a variant of GORA for humanoid action recognition with
skeleton sequences, which we call GORA-S. We briefly review the algorithm's
mathematical foundations and contextualize them in the problem of action
recognition with skeleton sequences. Subsequently, we introduce GORA-S and
discuss parameters and numerical techniques for its effective implementation.
We then compare its performance with that of the DTW and FastDTW algorithms, in
terms of computational efficiency and accuracy in matching skeletons. Our
results show that GORA-S attains a complexity that is significantly less than
that of any tested DTW method. In addition, it displays a favorable balance
between speed and accuracy that remains invariant under changes in skeleton
sampling frequency, lending it a degree of versatility that could make it
well-suited for a variety of action recognition tasks.

simultaneously and therefore the main aim of developing a stereo vision system

present a real-time stereo vision system used for road surface 3-D
reconstruction. The proposed system is developed from our previously published
3-D reconstruction algorithm where the perspective view of the target image is
first transformed into the reference view, which not only increases the
disparity accuracy but also improves the processing speed. Then, the
correlation cost between each pair of blocks is computed and stored in two 3-D
cost volumes. To adaptively aggregate the matching costs from neighbourhood
systems, bilateral filtering is performed on the cost volumes. This greatly
reduces the ambiguities during stereo matching and further improves the
precision of the estimated disparities. Finally, the subpixel resolution is
achieved by conducting a parabola interpolation and the subpixel disparity map
is used to reconstruct the 3-D road surface. The proposed algorithm is
implemented on an NVIDIA GTX 1080 GPU for the real-time purpose. The
experimental results illustrate that the reconstruction accuracy is around 3

  Compensation, Analysis and Scaling Law","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1704.04725",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we apply angle-domain Doppler compensation for high-mobility
wideband massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) uplink transmission. The
time-varying multipath channel is considered between high-speed terminal and
static base station (BS), where multiple Doppler frequency offsets (DFOs) are
associated with distinct angle of departures (AoDs). With the aid of the
large-scale uniform linear array (ULA) at the transmitter, we design a
beamforming network to generate multiple parallel beamforming branches, each
transmitting signal pointing to one particular angle. Then, the transmitted
signal in each branch will experience only one dominant DFO when passing over
the time-varying channel, which can be easily compensated before transmission
starts. We theoretically analyze the Doppler spread of the equivalent uplink
channel after angle-domain Doppler compensation, which takes into account both
the mainlobe and sidelobes of the transmit beam in each branch. It is seen that
the channel time-variation can be effectively suppressed if the number of
transmit antennas is sufficiently large. Interestingly, the asymptotic scaling
law of channel variation is obtained, which shows that the Doppler spread is
proportional to the maximum DFO and decreases approximately as $1/\sqrt{M}$
($M$ is the number of transmit antennas) when $M$ is sufficiently large.
Numerical results are provided to corroborate the proposed scheme.

axisymmetric dusty gas under the action of monochromatic radiation with a
constant intensity per unit area, which has variable azimuthal and axial
components of fluid velocity, is investigated. The gas is assumed to be grey
and opaque, and the shock is assumed to be transparent. The dusty gas is
considered as a mixture of non-ideal gas and small solid particles, in which
solid particles are continuously distributed. To obtain some essential features
of shock propagation, small solid particles are considered as a pseudo-fluid,
and it is assumed that the equilibrium flow condition is maintained in the
entire flow-field. Similarity solutions are obtained as well as the effects of
the variation of the radiation parameter, the gravitation parameter, the
non-idealness parameter of the gas, the mass concentration of solid particles
in the mixture, the ratio of the density of solid particles to the initial
density of the gas are worked out in detail. The similarity solution exists
under the constant initial angular velocity, and the shock strength is
independent from the radiation parameter and the gravitation parameter. It is
found that radiation parameter dominates the effect of dusty gas parameters on
the variation of radiation heat flux. The total energy of the flow-field behind
the shock front is not constant but varies as fourth power of the shock radius.

equivalent to the classical energy, that the plane Couette and Poiseuille flows

$\pi^2/(2 {\rm Re})$, and it is a bound from above of the time-decay of
streamwise perturbations of linearized equations. We also prove that the plane
Couette and Poiseuille flows are nonlinearly stable if the Reynolds number is
less then ${\rm Re}_{Orr}/\sin \varphi$ when the perturbation is a tilted
perturbation, i.e. 2D perturbations with wave vector which forms an angle
$\varphi \in [0, \pi/2]$ with the direction ${\bf i}$ of the motion. ${\rm
Re}_{Orr}$ is the Orr (1907) critical Reynolds number for spanwise
perturbations which, for the Couette flow is ${\rm Re}_{Orr}=177.22$ and for
the Poiseuille flow is ${\rm Re}_{Orr}=175.31$.
  In particular these results improve those obtained by Joseph (1966), who
found for streamwise perturbations a critical nonlinear value of $82.6$ in the
Couette case, and those obtained by Joseph and Carmi (1969), who found the
value $99.1$ for plane Poiseuille flow for streamwise perturbations. The

order to generate magnetic fields during inflation. The coupling is expected to
depend on a scalar field, possibly the same as the one driving inflation. At
the level of three-point functions, such a coupling leads to a non-trivial
cross-correlation between the perturbation in the scalar field and the magnetic
field. This cross-correlation has been evaluated analytically earlier for the
case of non-helical electromagnetic fields. In this work, we numerically
compute the cross-correlation for helical magnetic fields. Non-Gaussianities
are often generated as modes leave the Hubble radius. The helical
electromagnetic modes evolve strongly (when compared to the non-helical case)
around Hubble exit and one type of polarization is strongly amplified
immediately after Hubble exit. We find that helicity considerably boosts the
amplitude of the dimensionless non-Gaussianity parameter that characterizes the
amplitude and shape of the cross-correlation between the perturbations in the
scalar field and the magnetic field. We discuss the implications of the
enhancement in the non-Gaussianity parameter due to parity violation.

equation LE Fox and Lu proposed such a description for ion channels in 1994.
Their contraction followed the works of van Kampen and of T. Kurtz. The
contraction produces a diffusion term with a state dependent diffusion matrix,
D, that arises from the coupling matrix, S, in the LE. This S connected the
noise terms to the channel subunit variables in the LE. Fox and Lu and many
others later on observed that SS = D. Since D was determined by the contraction
of the MC equations into the FP equation, this left the problem of determining
the square root matrix, S, for every time step of the simulation. Since this is
time consuming, Fox and Lu introduced simplified models not requiring the
square root of a matrix. Subsequently, numerous studies were published that
showed the several shortcomings of these simplified models. In 2011, Goldwyn et
al. [6] rediscovered the overlooked original matrix dependent approach in the
Fox-Lu 1994 paper. They showed that it produced results in very good agreement
with the MC results. In 1991, Fox and Keizer [7] wrote a paper on an unrelated
topic that utilized the work of van Kampen and of Kurtz. In that work the
connection between D and S is SST = D. ST is the adjoint (transpose) of S. D
remains a positive definite symmetric matrix but S need not be. Fox has
reproduced the 2012 results of Orio and Soudry for potassium channels and has
also found in closed form the solution for the more complicated sodium
channels. The square root problem generally must be done numerically, but the
Cholesky is always doable in closed form. Thereby the S matrix for sodium is

sample of about 500 member stars for which radial velocities (RVs), Fe and Na
abundances have been homogeneously derived. At distances from the cluster
center larger than about 0.5 $r_h$, we find that first (FG - Na-poor) and
second generation (SG - Na-rich) stars show hints of different line-of-sight
velocity dispersion profiles, with FG stars being dynamically hotter. This is
the first time that differences in the velocity dispersion of MPs are detected
by using only RVs. While kinematic differences between MPs in globular clusters
are usually described in terms of anisotropy differences driven by the
different radial distributions, this explanation seems hardly viable for
NGC6362, where SG and FG stars are spatially mixed. We demonstrate that the
observed difference in the velocity dispersion profiles can be accounted for by
the effect of binary stars. In fact, thanks to our multi-epoch RV measurements
we find that the binary fraction is significantly larger in the FG sample
(f~14%) than in SG population (f<1%), and we show that such a difference can
inflate the velocity dispersion of FG with respect to SG by the observed amount
in the relevant radial range. Our results nicely match the predictions of
state-of-the art $N$-body simulations of the co-evolution of MPs in globular
clusters that include the effect of binaries.

Starting from a kinetic equation which describes the movement of robots based

dominated by alignment, irrespective of the long range movement. This is in

image, and must generalize to locate novel target objects with zero-shot
training. Previous work has focused on searching for perfect matches of a
target after extensive category-specific training. Here we show for the first
time that humans can efficiently and invariantly search for natural objects in
complex scenes. To gain insight into the mechanisms that guide visual search,
we propose a biologically inspired computational model that can locate targets
without exhaustive sampling and generalize to novel objects. The model provides
an approximation to the mechanisms integrating bottom-up and top-down signals
during search in natural scenes.

misclassifying images. Previous works had successes in generating
noisy/edge-rich adversarial perturbations, at the cost of degradation of image
quality. Such perturbations, even when they are small in scale, are usually
easily spottable by human vision. In contrast, we propose Harmonic Adversar-
ial Attack Methods (HAAM), that generates edge-free perturbations by using
harmonic functions. The property of edge-free guarantees that the generated
adversarial images can still preserve visual quality, even when perturbations
are of large magnitudes. Experiments also show that adversaries generated by
HAAM often have higher rates of success when transferring between models. In
addition, we find harmonic perturbations can simulate natural phenomena like
natural lighting and shadows. It would then be possible to help find corner
cases for given models, as a first step to improving them.

smartphones is presented in this paper by exploiting users' unique application
usage data, i.e., distinct patterns of use, modeled by a Markovian process.
Variations of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are evaluated for continuous user
verification, and challenges due to the sparsity of session-wise data, an
explosion of states, and handling unforeseen events in the test data are
tackled. Unlike traditional approaches, the proposed formulation does not
depend on the top N-apps, rather uses the complete app-usage information to
achieve low latency. Through experimentation, empirical assessment of the
impact of unforeseen events, i.e., unknown applications and unforeseen
observations, on user verification is done via a modified edit-distance
algorithm for simple sequence matching. It is found that for enhanced
verification performance, unforeseen events should be incorporated in the
models by adopting smoothing techniques with HMMs. For validation, extensive
experiments on two distinct datasets are performed. The marginal smoothing
technique is the most effective for user verification in terms of equal error
rate (EER) and with a sampling rate of 1/30s^{-1} and 30 minutes of historical
data, and the method is capable of detecting an intrusion within ~2.5 minutes
of application use.

includes a discussion on the possible adversary and communication models along
with the existing security attacks on ZICDA systems, and it reviews the
state-of-the-art proximity detection techniques that make use of contextual
information. These proximity detection techniques are commonly referred to as
Contextual Co-presence (COCO) protocols, which dynamically collect and use
contextual information to improve the security of ZICDA systems during the
proximity verification process. Finally, we summarize the significant
challenges and suggest possible innovative and efficient future solutions for
securely detecting co-presence between devices in the presence of adversaries.
The proximity verification techniques presented in the literature usually
involve trade-offs between metrics such as efficiency, security, deployment
cost, and usability. At present, there is no ideal solution which adequately
addresses the trade-off between these metrics. Therefore, we trust that this
review gives an insight into the strengths and shortcomings of the known
research methodologies and pave the way for the design of future practical,
secure, and efficient solutions.

be inefficient. One possibility to achieve both generality and efficiency is to
specialize this procedure w.r.t. any given narrow task. However, complete
specialization that implies direct mapping from the task parameters to
solutions (discriminative models) without search is not always possible. In
this paper, partial specialization of general search is considered in the form
of genetic algorithms (GAs) with a specialized crossover operator. We perform a
feasibility study of this idea implementing such an operator in the form of a
deep feedforward neural network. GAs with trainable crossover operators are
compared with the result of complete specialization, which is also represented
as a deep neural network. Experimental results show that specialized GAs can be
more efficient than both general GAs and discriminative models.
