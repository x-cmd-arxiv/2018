  rates","28 pages",,,,"math.AP math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study diffusion and mixing in different linear fluid dynamics models,
mainly related to incompressible flows. In this setting, mixing is a purely
advective effect which causes a transfer of energy to high frequencies. When
diffusion is present, mixing enhances the dissipative forces. This phenomenon
is referred to as enhanced dissipation, namely the identification of a
time-scale faster than the purely diffusive one. We establish a precise
connection between quantitative mixing rates in terms of decay of negative
Sobolev norms and enhanced dissipation time-scales. The proofs are based on a
contradiction argument that takes advantage of the cascading mechanism due to
mixing, an estimate of the distance between the inviscid and viscous dynamics,
and of an optimization step in the frequency cut-off.
  Thanks to the generality and robustness of our approach, we are able to apply
our abstract results to a number of problems. For instance, we prove that
contact Anosov flows obey logarithmically fast dissipation time-scales. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a flow that induces an
enhanced dissipation time-scale faster than polynomial. Other applications
include passive scalar evolution in both planar and radial settings and
fractional diffusion.

pseudopotential up to next-to-next-to-next-to leading order (N3LO), we derive
the expressions of Hamiltonian density and single nucleon potential under
general non-equilibrium conditions which can be applied in transport model
simulations of heavy-ion collisions induced by neutron-rich nuclei. While the
conventional Skyrme interactions, which include the terms in relative momenta
up to second order, predict an incorrect behavior as a function of energy for
nucleon optical potential in nuclear matter, the present extended N3LO Skyrme
interaction can give a nice description for the empirical nucleon optical
potential. We also construct three interaction sets with different high-density
behaviors of the symmetry energy, by fitting both the empirical nucleon optical
potential up to energy of $1$ GeV and the empirical properties of isospin
asymmetric nuclear matter. These extended N3LO Skyrme interactions will be
useful in transport model simulations of heavy-ion collisions induced by
neutron-rich nuclei at intermediate and high energies, and they can also be
useful in nuclear structure studies within the mean-field model.

we describe Badger - a new hybrid approach for complexity analysis, with the
goal of discovering vulnerabilities which occur when the worst-case time or
space complexity of an application is significantly higher than the average
case. Badger uses fuzz testing to generate a diverse set of inputs that aim to
increase not only coverage but also a resource-related cost associated with
each path. Since fuzzing may fail to execute deep program paths due to its
limited knowledge about the conditions that influence these paths, we
complement the analysis with a symbolic execution, which is also customized to
search for paths that increase the resource-related cost. Symbolic execution is
particularly good at generating inputs that satisfy various program conditions
but by itself suffers from path explosion. Therefore, Badger uses fuzzing and
symbolic execution in tandem, to leverage their benefits and overcome their
weaknesses. We implemented our approach for the analysis of Java programs,
based on Kelinci and Symbolic PathFinder. We evaluated Badger on Java
applications, showing that our approach is significantly faster in generating
worst-case executions compared to fuzzing or symbolic execution on their own.

models can be compared. Our model assigns a star-formation rate (SFR) to each
dark matter halo based on the growth rate of the halo and a
redshift-independent star-formation efficiency. The dark matter halo accretion
rate is obtained from a high-resolution $N$-body simulation in order to capture
the stochasticity in accretion histories and to obtain spatial information for
the distribution of galaxies. The halo mass dependence of the star-formation
efficiency is calibrated at $z=4$ by requiring a match to the observed UV LF at
this redshift. The model then correctly predicts the observed UV LF at
$z=5-10$. We present predictions for the UV luminosity and stellar mass
functions, \textit{JWST} number counts, and SFHs. In particular, we find a
stellar-to-halo mass relation at $z=4-10$ that scales with halo mass at $M_{\rm
h}<10^{11}~M_{\odot}$ as $M_{\star}\propto M_{\rm h}^2$, with a normalization
that is higher than the relation inferred at $z=0$. The average SFRs increase
as a function of time to $z=4$, although there is significant scatter around
the average: about 6\% of the $z=4$ galaxies show no significant mass growth.
Using these SFHs, we present redshift-dependent UV-to-SFR conversion factors,
mass return fractions, and mass-to-light ratios for different intial mass
functions and metallicities, finding that current estimates of the cosmic SFR
density at $z\sim10$ may be overestimated by $\sim0.1-0.2~\mathrm{dex}$.

into final states (including neutrinos) of the Standard Model. We find that
they can lead to a successful explosion in otherwise non-exploding progenitors.
Depending on their unknown parameters (e.g., mass and coupling constants with
matter), we obtain either no explosion or an explosion of one of two types,
i.e., through heating of gas downstream of the stalled shock wave, similarly to
the standard scenario for supernova explosions or through heating of gas at
higher radii that ejects matter from the outer core or the envelope while the
center continues to accrete matter. In both cases, the explosion energies can
be very high. We presume that this new type of explosion would produce an
electromagnetic signal that significantly differs from common events because of
the relative absence of heavy elements in the ejecta. The combination of
core-collapse simulations and astrophysical observations may further constrain
the parameters of the sterile neutrinos.

resolve this issue, we combine GALEX ultraviolet photometry, SDSS photometry
and spectra, and new stellar population synthesis models to fit the SFHs of 532
post-starburst galaxies. In addition to an old stellar population and a recent
starburst, 48% of the galaxies are best fit with a second recent burst. Lower
stellar mass galaxies (log M$_\star$/M$_\odot<10.5$) are more likely to
experience two recent bursts, and the fraction of their young stellar mass is
more strongly anti-correlated with their total stellar mass. Applying our
methodology to other, younger post-starburst samples, we identify likely
progenitors to our sample and examine the evolutionary trends of molecular gas
and dust content with post-burst age. We discover a significant (4$\sigma$)
decline, with a 117-230 Myr characteristic depletion time, in the molecular gas
to stellar mass fraction with the post-burst age. The implied rapid gas
depletion rate of 2-150 M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ cannot be due to current star
formation, given the upper limits on the current SFRs in these post-starbursts.
Nor are stellar winds or SNe feedback likely to explain this decline. Instead,
the decline points to the expulsion or destruction of molecular gas in
outflows, a possible smoking gun for AGN feedback.

phases are studied in solids and cold-atom optical lattices. The principal
finding is that deformations do not couple, in general, to the low-energy
effective Hamiltonian as a pseudoelectromagnetic gauge potential. The response
of an optical lattice to strains is simpler, but still only one of several
strain-induced terms in the corresponding low-energy Hamiltonian can be
interpreted as a gauge potential. Most interestingly, the strains can induce a
nematic order parameter that splits a double-Weyl node into a pair of Weyl
nodes with the unit topological charges. The effects of deformations on the
motion of wavepackets in the double-Weyl optical lattice model are studied. It
is found that, even in the undeformed lattices, the wavepackets with opposite
topological charges can be spatially split. Strains, however, modify their
velocities in a very different way and lead to a spin polarization of the
wavepackets.

quantitatively show that the large number of DWD detections will allow us to

Furthermore, the LISA sample is found to be sufficient to disentangle between

sufficiently large radii. Finally, up to $\sim 80$ DWDs can be detected through

multi-messenger astronomy with DWD binaries and allows one to extract their

impossible, since an appropriate classical limit does not result.
  For a more complete study, we then also consider generalized, or local,
transition operators, that depend on the local phase-space coordinates, as well
as their derivatives. In this framework, one example of possible physical
interest is constructed. Because of its limited validity and complicated form,

and that this would be a new major mode of galaxy evolution. Observations of
galactic outflows have revealed that they host large amounts of dense and
clumpy molecular gas, which provide conditions suitable for star formation. We
have investigated the properties of the outflows in a large sample of galaxies
by exploiting the integral field spectroscopic data of the large MaNGA-SDSS4
galaxy survey. We find that star formation occurs inside at least half of the
galactic outflows in our sample. We also show that even if star formation is
prominent inside many other galactic outflows, this may have not been revealed
as the diagnostics are easily dominated by the presence of even faint AGN and
shocks. If very massive outflows typical of distant galaxies and quasars follow
the same scaling relations observed locally, then the star formation inside
high-z outflows can be up to several 100 Msun/yr and could contribute
substantially to the early formation of the spheroidal component of galaxies.
Star formation in outflows can also potentially contribute to establishing the
scaling relations between black holes and their host spheroids. Moreover,
supernovae exploding on large orbits can chemically enrich in-situ and heat the
circumgalactic and intergalactic medium. Finally, young stars ejected on large
orbits may also contribute to the reionization of the Universe.

  model exploration","submission QI2018 ( v2: Separable model, raw data updated )",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In source memory studies, a decision-maker is concerned with identifying the
context in which a given episodic experience occurred. A common paradigm for
studying source memory is the `three-list' experimental paradigm, where a
subject studies three lists of words and is later asked whether a given word
appeared on one or more of the studied lists. Surprisingly, the sum total of
the acceptance probabilities generated by asking for the source of a word
separately for each list (`list 1?', `list 2?', `list 3?') exceeds the
acceptance probability generated by asking whether that word occurred on the
union of the lists (`list 1 or 2 or 3?'). The episodic memory for a given word
therefore appears over distributed on the disjoint contexts of the lists. A
quantum episodic memory model [QEM] was proposed by Brainerd, Wang and Reyna
(2013) to explain this type of result. In this paper, we apply a Hamiltonian
dynamical extension of QEM for over distribution of source memory. The
Hamiltonian operators are simultaneously driven by parameters for re-allocation
of gist-based and verbatim-based acceptance support as subjects are exposed to
the cue word in the first temporal stage, and are attenuated for
description-dependence by the querying probe in the second temporal stage.
Overall, the model predicts well the choice proportions in both separate list
and union list queries and the over distribution effect, suggesting that a
Hamiltonian dynamics for QEM can provide a good account of the acceptance
processes involved in episodic memory tasks.

transition to detonation when a turbulent flame preceded by a shock interacts
with a single obstruction in its path, taken as a cylindrical obstacle or a
wall in the present study. The problem is addressed experimentally in a mixture
of propane-oxygen at sub-atmospheric conditions. The turbulent flame was
generated by passing a detonation wave through a perforated plate, yielding
flames with turbulent burning velocities 10 to 20 larger than the laminar
values and incident shock Mach numbers ranging between 2 and 2.5. Time resolved
schlieren videos recorded at approximately 100 kHz and numerical reconstruction
of the flow field permitted to determine the mechanism of flame acceleration
and transition to detonation. It was found to be the enhancement of the
turbulent burning rate of the flame through its interaction with the shock
reflection on the obstacle. The amplification of the burning rate was found to
drive the flame burning velocity close to the speed of sound with respect to
the fresh gases, resulting in the amplification of a shock in front of the
flame. The acceleration through this regime resulted in the strengthening of
this shock. Detonation was observed in regions of non-planarity of this
internal shock, inherited by the irregular shape of the turbulent flame itself.
Auto-ignition at early times of this process was found to be negligibly slow
compared with the flow evolution time scale in the problem investigated,
suggesting that the relevant time scale is primarily associated with the
increase in turbulent burning rate by the interaction with reflected shocks.

coannihilate with another particle can considerably loosen the relic density
constraints on the dark matter mass. In particular, introducing a single
strongly interacting coannihilation partner in a dark matter model can bring
the upper bound on the dark sector energy scale from a few TeV up to about 10
TeV. While these energies are outside the LHC reach, a large part of the
parameter space for such coannihilating models can be explored by future hadron
colliders. In this context, it is essential to determine whether the current
bounds on dark matter simplified models also hold in non-minimal scenarios. In
this paper, we study extended models that include multiple coannihilation
partners. We show that the relic density bounds on the dark matter mass in
these scenarios are stronger than for the minimal models in most of the
parameter space and that weakening these bounds requires sizable interactions
between the different species of coannihilation partners. Furthermore, we
discuss how these new interactions as well as the additional particles in the

transverse energy searches. This study serves as a vital ingredient towards the
determination of the highest possible energy scale for thermal dark matter

populations. Aims. We investigate red giant branch stars in E3 with the aim of
providing a first detailed chemical inventory for this cluster, we determine
its radial velocity, and we provide additional insights into the possible
presence of multiple populations in this cluster. Methods. We obtained
high-resolution FLAMES-UVES/VLT spectra of four red giant branch stars likely
members of E3. We performed a local thermodynamic equilibrium abundance
analysis based on one-dimensional plane parallel ATLAS9 model atmospheres.
Abundances were derived from line equivalent widths or spectrum synthesis.
Results. We measured abundances of Na and of iron peak (Fe, V, Cr, Ni, Mn),
$\alpha$ (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti), and neutron capture elements (Y, Ba, Eu). The mean
cluster heliocentric radial velocity, metallicity, and sodium abundance ratio
are v$_{helio}$=12.6$\pm$0.4 km/s ($\sigma$=0.6$\pm$0.2 km/s),
[Fe/H]=-0.89$\pm$0.08 dex, and [Na/Fe]=0.18$\pm$0.07 dex, respectively. The low
Na abundance with no appreciable spread is suggestive of a cluster dominated by
first-generation stars in agreement with results based on lower resolution
spectroscopy. The low number of stars observed does not allow us to rule out a
minor population of second-generation stars. The observed chemical abundances
are compatible with the trends observed in Milky Way stars.

novel applications from the domain of process automation, Machine-Type
Communication (MTC) and cyber-physical systems, where short messages are
communicated and statistical guarantees need to be provided on a per-message
level. In order to optimize such a network, apart from understanding the
stationary system dynamics, an understanding of the short-term dynamics (i.e.,
transient behavior) is also required. To this end, we derive novel Wireless
Transient Bounds (WTB) for end-to-end delay and backlog in a multi-hop wireless
network using stochastic network calculus approach. WTB depends on the initial
backlog at each node as well as the instantaneous channel states. We
numerically compare WTB with State-Of-The-Art Transient bounds (SOTAT), that
can be obtained by adapting existing stationary bounds, as well as simulation
of the network. While SOTAT and stationary bounds are not able to capture the
short-term system dynamics well, WTB provides relatively tight upper bound and
has a decay rate that closely matches the simulation. This is achieved by WTB
only with a slight increase in the computational complexity, by a factor of O(T
+ N), where T is the duration of the arriving sequence and N is the number of
hops in the network. We believe that the presented analysis and the bounds can
be used as base for future work on transient network optimization, e.g., in
massive MTC, critical MTC, edge computing and autonomous vehicle.

familiar from the Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde (DVV) conjecture on exact

unusual spin (circular polarization)- dependent transverse momentum, the
so-called Belinfante's spin momentum. Such highly nontrivial structure of the
momentum and the spin densities in the structured optical fields (e.g.,

possibilities for the enhancement of not only the magnitudes but also the

opens up interesting avenues for experimental detection of these illusive

compass chain under an alternating transverse magnetic field. The model can be
analytically solved by the Jordan-Wigner transformation and this solution shows
that it is equivalent to a two-component one-dimensional (1D) Fermi gas on a
lattice. We explore mutual effects of the staggered magnetic interaction and
multi-site interactions on the energy spectra and analyze the ground state
phase diagram. We use quantum coherence measures to identify the quantum phase
transitions. Our results show that $l_1$ norm of coherence fails to detect
faithfully the quantum critical points separating a gapped phase from a gapless
phase, which can be pinpointed exactly by relative entropy of coherence.
Jensen-Shannon divergence is somewhat obscure at exception points. We also
propose an experimental realization of such a 1D system using superconducting
quantum circuits.

maximize the ergodic capacity of vehicular-to-infrastructure (V2I) links while
guaranteeing the latency requirements of vehicular-to-vehicular (V2V) links.
First, for each possible spectrum reusing pair of a V2I link and a V2V link, we
obtain the closed-form expression of the packets' average sojourn time (the
queueing time plus the service time) for the V2V link. Then, an optimal power
allocation is derived for each possible spectrum reusing pair. Afterwards, we
optimize the spectrum reusing pattern by addressing a polynomial time solvable

developed resource allocation always guarantees the V2V links' requirements on

submodular optimization and online learning. In the online unconstrained
submodular maximization (online USM) problem, there is a universe
$[n]=\{1,2,...,n\}$ and a sequence of $T$ nonnegative (not necessarily
monotone) submodular functions arrive over time. The goal is to design a
computationally efficient online algorithm, which chooses a subset of $[n]$ at
each time step as a function only of the past, such that the accumulated value
of the chosen subsets is as close as possible to the maximum total value of a
fixed subset in hindsight. Our main result is a polynomial-time no-$1/2$-regret
algorithm for this problem, meaning that for every sequence of nonnegative
submodular functions, the algorithm's expected total value is at least $1/2$
times that of the best subset in hindsight, up to an error term sublinear in
$T$. The factor of $1/2$ cannot be improved upon by any polynomial-time online
algorithm when the submodular functions are presented as value oracles.
Previous work on the offline problem implies that picking a subset uniformly at
random in each time step achieves zero $1/4$-regret.
  A byproduct of our techniques is an explicit subroutine for the two-experts
problem that has an unusually strong regret guarantee: the total value of its
choices is comparable to twice the total value of either expert on rounds it
did not pick that expert. This subroutine may be of independent interest.

building a matrix that encodes a detector's smearing of the desired true

provides an estimate of the true variable. This deconvolution process is known
as unfolding. The unfolding method implemented in PyUnfold accomplishes this

DCO+(2-1), which show similar spatial extent, and H13CO+(1-0). The non-thermal
contribution to the velocity dispersion increases from higher to lower density
tracers. The change of magnitude and direction of the total velocity gradients
depending on the tracer used indicates that internal motions change at
different depths within the cloud. N2D+ and N2H+ show smaller gradients than
the lower density tracers DCO+ and H13CO+, implying a loss of specific angular
momentum at small scales. At the level of cloud-core transition, the core's
external envelope traced by DCO+ and H13CO+ is spinning up, consistent with
conservation of angular momentum during core contraction. C18O traces the more
extended cloud material whose kinematics is not affected by the presence of
dense cores. The decrease in specific angular momentum towards the centres of
the cores shows the importance of local magnetic fields to the small scale
dynamics of the cores. The random distributions of angles between the total

parameters in the device design, such as band gap variation with alloy
composition and band offset between Ga$_2$O$_3$ and
(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$, are yet to be established. Using density
functional theory with the HSE hybrid functional, we compute formation
enthalpies, band gaps, and band edge positions of (Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$
alloys in the monoclinic ($\beta$) and corundum ($\alpha$) phases. We find the
formation enthlapies of (Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ alloys are significantly
lower than of (In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$, and that (Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$
with $x$=0.5 can be considered as an ordered compound AlGaO$_3$ in the
monoclinic phase, with Al occupying the octahedral sites and Ga occupying the
tetrahedral sites. The direct band gaps of the alloys range from 4.69 to 7.03
eV for $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ and from 5.26 to 8.56 eV for
$\alpha$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$. Most of the band offset of the

some works to fuse pedestrian detectors to achieve a more accurate detection.
The intuition behind is to combine the detectors based on its spatial

(CSBC), which, in addition to relying on spatial consensus, considers the
content of the detection windows to learn a weighted-fusion of pedestrian
detectors. The result is a reduction in false alarms and an enhancement in the

enables our method to be efficient even employing simple features. The CSBC
overcomes state-of-the-art fusion methods in the ETH dataset and in the Caltech

Second, given a small number of labeled images, we can efficiently learn
detectors for these labels. In the few-shot regime, these detectors have a
substantially higher mAP of 0.22 compared to 0.12 of off-the-shelf standard

footprint with $90\text{\textdegree}<\rm{RA}<270\text{\textdegree}$. Based on a
near-infrared/infrared \textit{JKW2} color cut, the ELQS selection efficiently
uses random forest methods to classify quasars and to estimate photometric
redshifts; this scheme overcomes some of the difficulties of pure optical
quasar selection at $z\approx3$. As a result, we retain a completeness of
$>70\%$ over $z\sim3.0-5.0$ at $m_{i}\lesssim17.5$, limited toward fainter
magnitudes by the depth of the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). The presented
quasar catalog consists of a total of 270 objects, of which 39 are newly
identified in this work with spectroscopy obtained at the Vatican Advanced
Technology Telescope and the MMT $6.5\,\rm{m}$ telescope. In addition to the
high completeness, which allowed us to discover new quasars in the already
well-surveyed SDSS North Galactic Cap, the efficiency of our selection is
relatively high at $\sim79\%$. Using 120 objects of this quasar sample we are
able to extend the previously measured optical quasar luminosity function (QLF)

including biological imaging, remote sensing and robotics. Applications in
these domains require fast acquisition times, high timing resolution, and high

one of the most promising detector technologies to achieve all of these
requirements. However, these detectors are plagued by measurement distortions
known as pileup, which fundamentally limit their precision. In this work, we
develop a probabilistic image formation model that accurately models pileup. We
devise inverse methods to efficiently and robustly estimate scene depth and
reflectance from recorded photon counts using the proposed model along with
statistical priors. With this algorithm, we not only demonstrate improvements
to timing accuracy by more than an order of magnitude compared to the
state-of-the-art, but this approach is also the first to facilitate
sub-picosecond-accurate, photon-efficient 3D imaging in practical scenarios
where widely-varying photon counts are observed.

simulations of the Sun's shadow based on the potential field model of the solar
magnetic field averaged over each solar rotation period. We find, however, that
the magnitude of the observed intensity deficit in the Sun's shadow is
significantly less than that predicted by MC simulations, particularly during
the period around solar maximum when a significant number of ECMEs is recorded.
The $\chi^2$ tests of the agreement between the observations and the MC

ECMEs occur, and the difference is reduced if the periods of ECMEs are excluded
from the analysis. This suggests the first experimental evidence of the ECMEs

Fluctuating multispecies mass diffusion is formulated using a Maxwell-Stefan

described by a stochastic Navier-Stokes equation for the fluid velocity. We
consider a thermodynamically consistent generalization for the law of mass
action for non-dilute mixtures and use it in the chemical master equation (CME)

computational efficiency over traditional reaction-diffusion master equation
methods when the number of reactive molecules is large, while also retaining
accuracy even when there are as few as ten reactive molecules per hydrodynamic
cell. We present a numerical algorithm to solve the coupled FHD and CME
equations and validate it on both equilibrium and nonequilibrium problems. We
simulate a diffusively-driven gravitational instability in the presence of an
acid-base neutralization reaction, starting from a perfectly flat interface. We
demonstrate that the coupling between velocity and concentration fluctuations

energy and information carrier in nature. Without any doubt, exploration of the
phonon coherence and its impact on thermal conduction will markedly change many
aspects in broad applications for heat control and management in the real
world. So far, the application of coherent effect on manipulation of phonon
transport is a challenge work. In this article, we review recent advances in
the study of the phonon coherent transport in nanomaterials and nanostructures.
We first briefly look back the classical and quantum theory of coherence. Next,
we review the progresses made in the understanding of phonon coherence in
superlattice, nanowires and nanomeshes, respectively, focus on the effect of
phonon coherence on thermal conductivity. Finally, we introduce the recent
advances in the direct detection of phonon coherence using optical coherence

arbitrary $p$ states and study the order-disorder phase transitions in such a
$p$-state MV model on complex networks. By extensive Monte Carlo simulations
and a mean-field theory, we show that for $p\geq3$ the order of phase
transition is essentially different from a continuous second-order phase
transition in the original two-state MV model. Instead, for $p\geq3$ the model
displays a discontinuous first-order phase transition, which is manifested by
the appearance of the hysteresis phenomenon near the phase transition. Within
the hysteresis loop, the ordered phase and disordered phase are coexisting and
rare flips between the two phases can be observed due to the finite-size
fluctuation. Moreover, we investigate the type of phase transition under a
slightly modified dynamics [Melo \emph{et al.} J. Stat. Mech. P11032 (2010)].
We find that the order of phase transition in the three-state MV model depends
on the degree heterogeneity of networks. For $p\geq4$, both dynamics produce
the first-order phase transitions.

authenticated key exchange protocol, which ensures entity authentication and

this work presents a secure region-based handover scheme (ReHand) with user
anonymity and fast revocation for SCNs in 5G. ReHand greatly reduces the
communication costs when UEs roam between small cells within the region of a

analysis shows that the Cooper theorem is violated at zero chemical potential
but instead Cooper instability can be generated only if the absolute strength
of fermion-fermion coupling exceeds certain critical value and transfer
momentum is restricted to a confined region, which is determined by the initial
conditions. Rather, the Cooper theorem would be instantly restored once a
finite chemical potential is introduced and thus a chemical potential-tuned
phase transition is expected. Additionally, we briefly examine the effects of
impurity scatterings on the Cooper instability at zero chemical potential,
which in principle are harmful to Cooper instability although they can enhance
the density of states of systems. Furthermore, the influence of competition
between a finite chemical potential and impurities upon the Cooper instability
is also simply investigated. These results are expected to provide instructive
clues for exploring unconventional superconductors in the kinds of semimetals.

this study, we make use two different microscopic three-cluster models. The
first model employs the Hyperspherical Harmonics basis to numerate channels and
describe three-cluster continuum. The second model is the well-known complex

semi-realistic Minnesota and Hasegawa-Nagata potentials. Our main aim is to
find the Hoyle-analog states in these nuclei or, in other words, whether it is
possible to synthesize these nuclei in a triple collision of clusters. We
formulate the criteria for selecting such states and apply them to resonance
states, emerged from our calculations. We found that there are resonance states
obeying the formulated criteria which make possible syntheses of these nuclei

direct CP violation in the Cabibbo-favored charmed meson decays would be
evidence of new physics. In this paper, we conduct a quantitative study on
direct CP violation in $D^0\to K^-\pi^+$, $D_s^+\to \eta\pi^+$ and $D_s^+\to
\eta'\pi^+$ decays in the $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge
extension of the standard model. In the model, direct CP violation arises
mainly from the interference between the decay amplitude coming from the SM
left-left current operators and that from the right-right current operators
induced by $W_R^+$ gauge boson exchange. Interestingly, the strong phase
between the two amplitudes is evaluable, since it stems from difference in QCD
corrections to the left-left and right-right current operators, which is a
short-distance QCD effect given by
$\sim(\alpha_s(M_{W_L}^2)/4\pi)\log(M_{W_R}^2/M_{W_L}^2)$. We assess the
maximal direct CP violation in the above decays in the $SU(2)_L\times

direct CP violation in these modes and one in $K\to\pi\pi$ decay parametrized

hierarchy of clusters. It has been the dominant approach to constructing
embedded classification schemes since it outputs dendrograms, which capture the
hierarchical relationship among members at all levels of granularity,
simultaneously. Being greedy in the algorithmic sense, a hierarchical
clustering partitions data at every step solely based on a similarity /
dissimilarity measure. The clustering results oftentimes depend on not only the
distribution of the underlying data, but also the choice of dissimilarity
measure and the clustering algorithm. In this paper, we propose a method to
incorporate prior domain knowledge about entity relationship into the
hierarchical clustering. Specifically, we use a distance function in
ultrametric space to encode the external ontological information. We show that
popular linkage-based algorithms can faithfully recover the encoded structure.
Similar to some regularized machine learning techniques, we add this distance
as a penalty term to the original pairwise distance to regulate the final
structure of the dendrogram. As a case study, we applied this method on real
data in the building of a customer behavior based product taxonomy for an
Amazon service, leveraging the information from a larger Amazon-wide browse
structure. The method is useful when one wants to leverage the relational
information from external sources, or the data used to generate the distance
matrix is noisy and sparse. Our work falls in the category of semi-supervised
or constrained clustering.

resetting to the origin at a constant rate $r$ - the resetting process
introduced some time ago as an example of an efficient, optimisable search
algorithm. To this end, we first derive an exact expression for the covariance
function of an arbitrary (not necessarily a fBm) process with a reset,
expressing it through the covariance function of the parental process without a
reset, which yields the desired result for the fBm in a particular case. We
then use this result to compute exactly the power spectral density for fBM for
all frequency $f$. The asymptotic, large frequency $f$ behaviour of the PSD
turns out to be distinctly different for sub- $(H < 1/2)$ and super-diffusive
$(H > 1/2)$ fBms. We show that for large $f$, the PSD has a power law tail:
$S_T(f) \sim 1/f^{\gamma}$ where the exponent $\gamma= 2H+1$ for $0<H\le 1/2$
(sub-diffusive fBm), while $\gamma= 2$ for all $1/2\le H<1$. Thus, somewhat
unexpectedly, the exponent $\gamma=2$ in the superdiffusive case $H>1/2$ sticks
to its Brownian value and does not depend on $H$.

they are characterized by identifiability conditions, well-posedness

this article proposes and investigates a novel interpretation of

offers an explicitation of such prior constraints considering linear or

examples, so it is an effective approach to increase the clasificaiton
reliability and reduce the misclassification risk in the cost-sensitive
applications. In such applications, different types of errors (false positive
or false negative) usaully have unequal costs. And the error costs, which
depend on specific applications, are usually unknown. However, current
abstaining classification methods either do not distinguish the error types, or
they need the cost information of misclassification and rejection, which are
realized in the framework of cost-sensitive learning. In this paper, we propose
a bounded-abstention method with two constraints of reject rates (BA2), which
performs abstaining classification when error costs are unequal and unknown.
BA2 aims to obtain the optimal area under the ROC curve (AUC) by constraining
the reject rates of the positive and negative classes respectively.
Specifically, we construct the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve,
and stepwise search the optimal reject thresholds from both ends of the curve,
untill the two constraints are satisfied. Experimental results show that BA2
obtains higher AUC and lower total cost than the state-of-the-art abstaining
classification methods. Meanwhile, BA2 achieves controllable reject rates of
the positive and negative classes.

exciton polaritons in the strong-coupling regime in a monolayer WS2 based
semiconductor microcavity. Numerical simulations using Boltzmann equations give
an overall description of polariton kinetics over a temperature range of
130-230K, under nonresonant excitation. Here, only the scattering rate via
optical phonons (LO) from the upper (UP) towards lower (LP) polariton branches
is considered. According this model we show the importance of the radiative
lifetime of the polaritonic states relative to polariton relaxation rate. Our
results show as the cavity detuning changes from negative (130 K) to positive
(230 K) values, the UP branch can be tuned from a more excitonlike to a more
photonlike state at small wave vector k. We deduce that the UP states have a
faster lifetime and the polariton relaxation time into the LP energy states
becomes very efficient. Thus, the UP occupation starts to decrease, and we
observe a simultaneous increase in the occupation of the LP branch.
Furthermore, the polariton states are less occupied for small excitation pump
rate, the calculated behavior is linear. In the high pumping regime, we observe
the nonlinear behavior of cavity polaritons and occupation factors much larger
than unity are reached.

The traditional i-vector approach trains a generative model (basically a

the end-to-end approach directly trains a discriminative model (often a neural
network) to learn discriminative speaker embeddings; a crucial component is the
training criterion. In this paper, we use angular softmax (A-softmax), which is
originally proposed for face verification, as the loss function for feature
learning in end-to-end speaker verification. By introducing margins between
classes into softmax loss, A-softmax can learn more discriminative features
than softmax loss and triplet loss, and at the same time, is easy and stable
for usage. We make two contributions in this work. 1) We introduce A-softmax
loss into end-to-end speaker verification and achieve significant EER

are often pooled in meta-analyses. Here we examine the simplest case where for

rise to a series of $2 \times 2$ tables. A variety of measures of treatment
effect are then available and are conventionally used in meta-analyses, such as
the odds ratio, the risk ratio and the risk difference. Here we propose a new
type of measure of treatment effect for this type of data that is very easily
interpretable by lay audiences. We give the rationale for the new measure and
we present three contrasting methods for computing its within-study variance so
that it can be used in conventional meta-analyses. We then develop three
alternative methods for random-effects meta-analysis that use our measure and
we apply our methodolgy to some real examples. We conclude that our new measure
is a fully viable alternative to existing measures. It has the advantage that
its interpretation is especially simple and direct, so that its meaning can be
more readily understood by those with little or no formal statistical training.
This may be especially valuable when presenting `plain language summaries',

  Methods: Thirty static [18F]FDG and 11 dynamic [18}F]PE2I acquisitions from a
GE SIGNA PET/MR were reconstructed using ZTEAC (using a research tool, GE
Healthcare), single-subject AtlasAC (the current default AC in GE's SIGNA

[18F]FDG reconstructions, the bias caused by ZTEAC and AtlasAC in the mean

analyzed in PMOD. For the 11 dynamic [18}F]PE2I reconstructions, the bias
caused by ZTEAC and AtlasAC in the non displaceable binding potential BPnd in
the striatum was calculated with cerebellum as the reference region and a
simplified reference tissue model.
  Results: The regional bias caused by ZTEAC in the static [18F]FDG
reconstructions ranged from -8.0% to +7.7% (mean 0.1%, SD 2.0%). For AtlasAC
this bias ranged from -31.6% to +16.6% (mean -0.4%, SD 4.3%). The bias caused
by AtlasAC showed a clear gradient in the cranio-caudal direction (-4.2% in the
cerebellum, +6.6% in the left superior frontal gyrus). The bias in the striatal
BPnd for the [18F]PE2I reconstructions ranged from -0.8% to +4.8% (mean 1.5%,
SD 1.4%) using ZTEAC and from -0.6% to +9.4% using AtlasAC (mean 4.2%, SD
2.6%).
  Conclusion: ZTEAC provides excellent quantitative accuracy for static and
dynamic brain PET/MR, comparable to CTAC, and is clearly superior to the
default AtlasAC currently implemented in the GE SIGNA PET/MR.

clustering parameters and the inclusion of a large portion of the undesirable
region (i.e., a large number of noise points). To overcome these problems, we
present DIR-ST$^2$, a novel framework for delineating an imprecise region by
iteratively performing density-based clustering, namely DBSCAN, along with not
only spatio--textual information but also temporal information on social media.
Specifically, we aim at finding a proper radius of a circle used in the
iterative DBSCAN process by gradually reducing the radius for each iteration in
which the temporal information acquired from all resulting clusters are
leveraged. Then, we propose an efficient and automated algorithm delineating
the imprecise region via hierarchical clustering. Experiment results show that
by virtue of the significant noise reduction in the region, our DIR-ST$^2$
method outperforms the state-of-the-art approach employing one-class support
vector machine in terms of the $\mathcal{F}_1$ score from comparison with
precisely-defined regions regarded as a ground truth, and returns apparently
better delineation of imprecise regions. The computational complexity of

the normal equations approach in complex variables and the hybrid equality

on transmission networks having up to 9241 nodes; they show that the complex
variable equality constrained hybrid state estimator exhibits superior
performance as compared to the above two techniques in terms of both

bulk density and atmospheric measurements difficult. Here, we present the
discovery and validation of a newly found $2.03^{+0.08}_{-0.07}~R_{\bigoplus}$

traditional approximation schemes based on segments is that in the present

promising techniques to enhance the computation capability and to prolong the

significantly impacted by the severe propagation loss. In order to address this
issue, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled MEC wireless powered system is
studied in this paper. The computation rate maximization problems in a
UAV-enabled MEC wireless powered system are investigated under both partial and
binary computation offloading modes, subject to the energy harvesting causal
constraint and the UAV's speed constraint. These problems are non-convex and
challenging to solve. A two-stage algorithm and a three-stage alternative
algorithm are respectively proposed for solving the formulated problems. The
closed-form expressions for the optimal central processing unit frequencies,
user offloading time, and user transmit power are derived. The optimal
selection scheme on whether users choose to locally compute or offload
computation tasks is proposed for the binary computation offloading mode.
Simulation results show that our proposed resource allocation schemes
outperforms other benchmark schemes. The results also demonstrate that the
proposed schemes converge fast and have low computational complexity.

coupling to matter of any spin is developed. As a completely new feature the
""Vierbein"" assuring local gauge invariance enters not as an independent
dynamical field, but emerges as a functional of the Lorentz gauge field. The
underlying geometry of the theory turns out to be a $SO(1,3)$ Banach bundle.
The most general action which is renormalizable by power-counting is
constructed in terms of the gauge field and its first derivatives. It contains
no higher derivative terms in the gauge field which destroy unitarity in the
usual renormalizable $R^2$-theories of gravitation. Finally equivalence of the
Lorentz gauge field theory coupled to spin zero matter with General Relativity
is established

elastic wave attenuation and phase velocity dispersion in heterogeneous
polycrystalline media. It is valid for statistically isotropic aggregates with
triclinic crystals of equiaxed shape and is equivalent to well-known
Stanke&Kino model when applied to cubic polycrystals. Moreover, an
approximation form of the general SOA model is obtained to improve
computational efficiency but retain adequate accuracy. Further comparison
between the SOA model and the approximated second order attenuation (ASOA)
model indicates the ASOA model has reasonable agreement with the SOA model both
on attenuation and phase velocity. Additional computational examples show the
ASOA model has better performance than Karal&Keller model. Thus, this
theoretical study provides effective approaches for modeling of acoustic
attenuation in heterogeneous polycrystalline materials for whole frequency
range, including the Rayleigh region, the stochastic region and the geometric
region. It will shed light on the practical development of ultrasonic
characterization of polycrystalline metals.

configurations and loading conditions. Three sets of beams were prepared and
tested under quasistatic and impact loadings by applying various impact height
and Dynamic Explicit loading conditions. The first set consisted of two beams,
where one of the beams was reinforced with steel bars and the other was
externally reinforced with GFRP sheet. The second set consisted of six beams,
with five of the beams were reinforced with steel bars and one of them wrapped
by GFRP sheet. The last set was tested to validate the response of concrete
beams reinforced by FRP bar. In addition, beams were reinforced with glass and
carbon fiber composite bars tested under Quasi-Static and Impact loading
conditions. The impact load was simulated by the concept of a drop of a solid
hammer from various heights. The numerical results showed that the developed
model can be an effective tool to predict the performance of retrofitted beams
under dynamic loading condition. Furthermore, the model showed that FRP
retrofitting of RC beams subjected to repetitive impact loads can effectively
improve their dynamic performance and can slow the progress of damage.

structural features of nanocomposite (Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu)100-x(nanoCo)x solders
with up to 0.8 wt.% nano Co. The effect of nano-sized Co particles was
investigated by means of differential thermal analysis (DTA), X-ray diffraction

The experimental data of DTA are compared with available literature data for
bulk Sn 3.0Ag-0.5Cu alloy to check the capability of minor nano-inclusions to
decrease the melting temperature of the SAC solder. The combination of
structural data in liquid and solid states provides important information about
the structural transformations of liquid Sn 3.0Ag 0.5Cu alloys caused by minor
Co additions and the phase formation during crystallization. Furthermore,
scanning electron microscopy has shown the mutual substitution of Co and Cu

GIS data, especially remote sensing image data. In recent years, social media
has become a rich source of disaster information that may be useful in
assessing damage at a lower cost. Such information includes text (e.g., tweets)
or images posted by eyewitnesses of a disaster. Most of the existing research
explores the use of text in identifying situational awareness information
useful for disaster response teams. The use of social media images to assess
disaster damage is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, based
on convolutional neural networks and class activation maps, to locate damage in
a disaster image and to quantify the degree of the damage. Our proposed
approach enables the use of social network images for post-disaster damage
assessment and provides an inexpensive and feasible alternative to the more

ventricular arrhythmia database (VFDB) and MIT normal sinus rhythm database

resampled to 200Hz, filtered to remove baseline wandering, projected to 2D gray

this is rarely incorporated in traditional network analysis. Recently, an
increasing effort has been made to fill this methodological gap by developing
network reconstruction approaches based on Bayesian inference. These
approaches, however, rely on assumptions of uniform error rates and on direct
estimations of the existence of each edge via repeated measurements, something
that is currently unavailable for the majority of network data. Here we develop
a Bayesian reconstruction approach that lifts these limitations by not only
allowing for heterogeneous errors, but also for single edge measurements
without direct error estimates. Our approach works by coupling the inference
approach with structured generative network models, which enable the
correlations between edges to be used as reliable uncertainty estimates.
Although our approach is general, we focus on the stochastic block model as the
basic generative process, from which efficient nonparametric inference can be
performed, and yields a principled method to infer hierarchical community
structure from noisy data. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with a
variety of empirical and artificial networks.

management in various engineered systems with high energy density, from power
electronics to heat exchangers in power plants and nuclear reactors.
Essentially, boiling is a complex physical process that involves interactions
between heating surface, liquid, and vapor. For engineering applications, the
boiling heat transfer is usually predicted by empirical correlations or
semi-empirical models, which has relatively large uncertainty. In this paper, a
data-driven approach based on deep feedforward neural networks is studied. The
proposed networks use near wall local features to predict the boiling heat
transfer. The inputs of networks include the local momentum and energy
convective transport, pressure gradients, turbulent viscosity, and surface
information. The outputs of the networks are the quantities of interest of a
typical boiling system, including heat transfer components, wall superheat, and
near wall void fraction. The networks are trained by the high-fidelity data
processed from first principle simulation of pool boiling under varying input
heat fluxes. State-of-the-art algorithms are applied to prevent the overfitting
issue when training the deep networks. The trained networks are tested in
interpolation cases and extrapolation cases which both demonstrate good
agreement with the original high-fidelity simulation results.

carried out by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using propane as the carbon
source and Si as the catalyst support. The effect of CVD process variables such
as temperature, choice of catalyst, etc on the growth behavior of nanotubes has
been examined to understand the catalytic growth of CNTs. The transition metal
catalysts, Fe and Ni, were used in both elemental metal form and in a metal
complex form. In the case of elemental metal catalysts, the respective metals
were deposited over the Si substrate using thermal evaporation following which
nanotubes were synthesized by means of CVD. Subsequent studies of the
synthesized carbon nanostructures employing elemental metal catalysts revealed
a significant influence of the temperature and the catalyst material on the
structure of CNTs. The CNTs synthesized using Ni catalyst were bamboo-like
whereas the CNTs developed employing Fe catalyst were straight tubes with
partial metal filling. Consequently, growth models for the different growth
mechanisms have been proposed. Certain limitations of the above process have
been overcome by employing spin-coating of a metal complex catalyst material on
the Si substrate. The CVD synthesis of nanotubes using metal complex catalysts
always resulted in partially catalyst filled CNTs. More importantly, the metal
complex catalyst could be easily patterned on the Si substrate using
spin-coating and photolithography, which resulted in site selective growth of
partially catalyst filled MWCNTs. Since the entire process of site selective
growth is suitable for conventional device fabrication, this method is a
promising and practical pathway for large-scale fabrication of several magnetic
material filled CNT-based devices.
