instead of learning from medical imaging data with region-level annotations,
our model was merely trained on imaging data with image-level labels to
classify diseases, and is able to identify abnormal image regions
simultaneously. Our model consists of a customized pooling structure and an
adaptive DenseNet front-end, which can effectively recognize possible disease
features for classification and localization tasks. Our method has been
validated on the publicly available ChestX-ray14 dataset. Experimental results
have demonstrated that our classification and localization prediction
performance achieved significant improvement over the previous models on the
ChestX-ray14 dataset. In summary, our network can produce accurate disease
classification and localization, which can potentially support clinical
decisions.

laser-based time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) has emerged and evolved as a
reliable, powerful, and versatile technique to measure the thermal properties
of a wide range of bulk and thin film materials and their interfaces. This
tutorial discusses the basics as well as the recent advances of the TDTR
technique and its applications in the thermal characterization of a variety of
materials. The tutorial begins with the fundamentals of the TDTR technique,
serving as a guideline for understanding the basic principles of this
technique. A diverse set of TDTR configurations that have been developed to
meet different measurement conditions are then presented, followed by several
variations of the TDTR technique that function similarly as the standard TDTR
but with their own unique features. This tutorial closes with a summary that
discusses the current limitations and proposes some directions for future
development.

displays unconventional spin-torque and gate-tunable superconductivity. While
the realization of QSH has demonstrated the nontrivial topology of the electron
wavefunctions of monolayer WTe$_2$, the geometrical properties of the

it has been increasingly recognized that the Berry curvature plays an important

electron transport, enantioselective optical responses, chiral polaritons and
even unconventional superconductivity. Here we utilize mid-infrared
optoelectronic microscopy to investigate the Berry curvature in monolayer
WTe$_2$. By optically exciting electrons across the inverted QSH gap, we
observe an in-plane circular photogalvanic current even under normal incidence.
The application of an out-of-plane displacement field further systematically
controls the direction and magnitude of the photocurrent. Our observed
photocurrent reveals a novel Berry curvature dipole that arises from the
nontrivial wavefunctions near the inverted gap edge. These previously
unrealized Berry curvature dipole and strong electric field effect are uniquely
enabled by the inverted band structure and tilted crystal lattice of monolayer
WTe$_2$. Such an electrically switchable Berry curvature dipole opens the door
to the observation of a wide range of quantum geometrical phenomena, such as
quantum nonlinear Hall, orbital-Edelstein and chiral polaritonic effects.

versus doping charge carriers on the mechanism of superconductivity in Fe-based
materials. Elucidating this issue is a major challenge since it would require a
large number of samples where structure properties or the carrier density is
systematically varied. FeSe, with its structural simplicity, is an ideal
platform for addressing this question. It has been demonstrated that the
superconductivity in this material can be controlled through crystal lattice
tuning, as well as electronic structure manipulation. Here, we apply a
high-throughput methodology to FeSe to systematically delineate the
interdependence of its structural and electronic properties. Using a dual-beam
pulsed laser deposition, we have generated FeSe films with a marked gradient in
the superconducting transition temperature (below 2 K < Tc < 12 K) across 1 cm
width of the films. The Tc gradient films display ~ 1% continuous stretch and
compression in the out-of-plane and in-plane lattice constants respectively,
triggering the continuous enhancement of superconductivity. Combining transport
and angular-resolved photoemission measurements on uniform FeSe films with
tunable Tc from 3 K to 14 K, we find that the electron carrier density is
intimately correlated with Tc, i.e., it increases by a factor of 6 and
ultimately surpasses the almost constant hole concentration. Our transmission
electron microscope and band structure calculations reveal that rather than by
shifting the chemical potential, the enhanced superconductivity is linked to
the selective adjustment of the dxy band dispersion across the Fermi level by
means of reduced local lattice distortions. Therefore, such novel mechanism
provides a key to understand discrete superconducting phases in FeSe.

realized as a bound state at zero energy, called a Majorana zero mode (MZM), in
the vortex core of a topological superconductor, or at the ends of a nanowire
when both superconductivity and strong spin orbital coupling are present. A MZM
can be detected as a zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP) in tunneling
spectroscopy. However, in practice, clean and robust MZMs have not been
realized in the vortices of a superconductor, due to contamination from
impurity states or other closely-packed Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM)
states, which hampers further manipulations of Majorana fermions. Here using
scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we show that a ZBCP well separated from the
other discrete CdGM states exists ubiquitously in the cores of free vortices in
the defect free regions of (Li0.84Fe0.16)OHFeSe, which has a superconducting
transition temperature of 42 K. Moreover, a Dirac-cone-type surface state is
observed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and its topological
nature is confirmed by band calculations. The observed ZBCP can be naturally
attributed to a MZM arising from this chiral topological surface states of a
bulk superconductor. (Li0.84Fe0.16)OHFeSe thus provides an ideal platform for
studying MZMs and topological quantum computing.

  Conference",,,,"stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bayesian optimization offers the possibility of optimizing black-box
operations not accessible through traditional techniques. The success of
Bayesian optimization methods such as Expected Improvement (EI) are
significantly affected by the degree of trade-off between exploration and
exploitation. Too much exploration can lead to inefficient optimization
protocols, whilst too much exploitation leaves the protocol open to strong
initial biases, and a high chance of getting stuck in a local minimum.
Typically, a constant margin is used to control this trade-off, which results
in yet another hyper-parameter to be optimized. We propose contextual
improvement as a simple, yet effective heuristic to counter this - achieving a
one-shot optimization strategy. Our proposed heuristic can be swiftly
calculated and improves both the speed and robustness of discovery of optimal
solutions. We demonstrate its effectiveness on both synthetic and real world
problems and explore the unaccounted for uncertainty in the pre-determination
of search hyperparameters controlling explore-exploit trade-off.

can achieve human-level in a popular 3D multiplayer first-person video game,
Quake III Arena Capture the Flag, using only pixels and game points as input.
These results were achieved by a novel two-tier optimisation process in which a
population of independent RL agents are trained concurrently from thousands of
parallel matches with agents playing in teams together and against each other
on randomly generated environments. Each agent in the population learns its own
internal reward signal to complement the sparse delayed reward from winning,
and selects actions using a novel temporally hierarchical representation that
enables the agent to reason at multiple timescales. During game-play, these
agents display human-like behaviours such as navigating, following, and
defending based on a rich learned representation that is shown to encode
high-level game knowledge. In an extensive tournament-style evaluation the
trained agents exceeded the win-rate of strong human players both as teammates
and opponents, and proved far stronger than existing state-of-the-art agents.
These results demonstrate a significant jump in the capabilities of artificial
agents, bringing us closer to the goal of human-level intelligence.

viscous processes in the stellar interior and magnetospheric braking in the
exterior, changing the inclination angle between the rotation and magnetic
axes. Using our recent solutions for the non-rigid precessional dynamics, and
viscous dissipation integrals derived in this paper, we make the only

first results for the full coupled evolution of spindown and inclination angle
for a model of a late-stage proto-neutron star with a strong toroidal magnetic
field, allowing for both electromagnetic torques and internal dissipation when
evolving the inclination angle. We explore this coupled evolution for a range
of initial inclination angles, rotation rates and magnetic field strengths. For
fixed initial inclination angle, our results indicate that the neutron-star
population naturally evolves into two classes: near-aligned and near-orthogonal
rotators -- with typical pulsars falling into the latter category. Millisecond
magnetars can evolve into the near-aligned rotators which mature magnetars
appear to be, but only for small initial inclination angle and internal
toroidal fields stronger than roughly $5\times 10^{15}$ G. Once any model has
evolved to either an aligned or orthogonal state, there appears to be no
further evolution away from this state at later times.

with the case when this symmetry is explicitly broken, which is called the
kinetic-conformal Horava theory. To do so we perform the canonical formulation
of the anisotropic conformal theory at the classical level with a general
conformal potential. Both theories have the generator of the anisotropic Weyl
transformations as a constraint but it changes from first to second-class when
the Weyl symmetry is broken. The FDiff-covariant vector a_i = \partial_i \ln N
plays the role of gauge connection for the anisotropic Weyl transformations. A
Lagrange multiplier plays also the role of gauge connection, being the time
component. The anisotropic conformal theory propagates the same number of
degrees of freedom of the kinetic-conformal theory, which in turn are the same
of General Relativity. This is due to exchange of a second-class constraint in
the kinetic-conformal case by a gauge symmetry in the anisotropic conformal
case. An exception occurs if the conformal potential does not depend on the
lapse function N, as is the case of the so called Cotton^2 potential, in which
case one of the physical modes becomes odd. We develop in detail two explicit
anisotropic conformal models. One of them depends on N whereas the other one is
the Cotton^2 model. We also study conformally flat solutions in the anisotropic
conformal and the kinetic-conformal theories, defining as conformally flat the
spatial metric, but leaving for N a form different to the one dictated by the
anisotropic Weyl transformations. We find that in both theories these
configurations have vanishing canonical momentum and they are critical points
of the potential. In the kinetic-conformal theory we find explicitly an exact,
nontrivial, conformally flat solution.

basis function support resulting from the overlay structure and is in many
cases not feasible. In this contribution, a parallelization strategy for the
multi-level hp-scheme is presented that is adapted to the scheme's simple
hierarchical structure. By distributing the computational domain among
processes on the granularity of the active leaf elements and utilizing shared
mesh data structures, good parallel performance is achieved, as redundant
computations on ghost elements are avoided. We show the scheme's parallel
scalability for problems with a few hundred elements per process. Furthermore,
the scheme is used in conjunction with the finite cell method to perform
numerical simulations on domains of complex shape.

last decade. In this paper we introduce a variant of the AMP algorithm that
takes into account glassy nature of the system under consideration. We coin
this algorithm as the approximate survey propagation (ASP) and derive it for a
class of low-rank matrix estimation problems. We derive the state evolution for
the ASP algorithm and prove that it reproduces the one-step replica symmetry
breaking (1RSB) fixed-point equations, well-known in physics of disordered
systems. Our derivation thus gives a concrete algorithmic meaning to the 1RSB
equations that is of independent interest. We characterize the performance of
ASP in terms of convergence and mean-squared error as a function of the free
Parisi parameter s. We conclude that when there is a model mismatch between the
true generative model and the inference model, the performance of AMP rapidly
degrades both in terms of MSE and of convergence, while ASP converges in a
larger regime and can reach lower errors. Among other results, our analysis
leads us to a striking hypothesis that whenever s (or other parameters) can be
set in such a way that the Nishimori condition $M=Q>0$ is restored, then the
corresponding algorithm is able to reach mean-squared error as low as the
Bayes-optimal error obtained when the model and its parameters are known and
exactly matched in the inference procedure.

detailed structures of biomolecules, many critical tasks in structural biology
remain data-limited. Whether performance in such tasks can be improved by using
large repositories of tangentially related structural data remains an open
question. To address this question, we focused on a central problem in biology:
predicting how proteins interact with one another---that is, which surfaces of
one protein bind to those of another protein. We built a training dataset, the
Database of Interacting Protein Structures (DIPS), that contains biases but is
two orders of magnitude larger than those used previously. We found that these
biases significantly degrade the performance of existing methods on
gold-standard data. Hypothesizing that assumptions baked into the hand-crafted
features on which these methods depend were the source of the problem, we
developed the first end-to-end learning model for protein interface prediction,
the Siamese Atomic Surfacelet Network (SASNet). Using only spatial coordinates
and identities of atoms, SASNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods trained on
gold-standard structural data, even when trained on only 3% of our new dataset.

massive fermions. The surface gap monotonically increases for a wide range of
$x$ values across the topological and trivial sides of the quantum-phase

that the gapped surface state survives the inversion of the bulk bands which
occurs at a critical point near $x=0.055$. The surface state exhibits a
non-zero in-plane spin polarization which decays exponentially with increasing
$x$, and that persists on both the topological and trivial insulator phases.
Its out-of-plane spin polarization remains zero demonstrating the absence of a
hedgehog spin texture expected from broken time-reversal symmetry. Our
calculations reveal qualitative agreement with the experimental results all

$\gamma$-ray emission from the Vela pulsar, PSR B0833$-$45, based on 40.3 hours
of observations with the largest telescope of H.E.S.S., CT5, in monoscopic
mode, and on 8 years of data obtained with the Fermi-LAT. A dedicated
very-low-threshold event reconstruction and analysis pipeline was developed
and, together with the CT5 telescope response model, was validated using the
Fermi-LAT data as reference. A pulsed $\gamma$-ray signal at a significance
level of more than $15\sigma$ is detected from the P2 peak of the Vela pulsar
light curve. Of a total of 15835 events, more than 6000 lie at an energy below
20 GeV, implying a significant overlap between H.E.S.S. II-CT5 and the
Fermi-LAT. While the investigation of the pulsar light curve with the LAT
confirms characteristics previously known up to 20 GeV, in the tens of GeV
energy range, CT5 data show a change in the pulse morphology of P2, i.e., an
extreme sharpening of its trailing edge, together with the possible onset of a
new component at 3.4$\sigma$ significance level. Assuming a power-law model for
the P2 spectrum, an excellent agreement is found for the photon indices
($\Gamma \simeq$ 4.1) obtained with the two telescopes above 10 GeV and an
upper bound of 8% is derived on the relative offset between their energy
scales. Using both instruments data, it is however shown that the spectrum of
P2 in the 10-100 GeV has a pronounced curvature, i.e. a confirmation of the
sub-exponential cutoff form found at lower energies with the LAT. This is
further supported by the weak evidence for an emission above 100 GeV obtained
with CT5. In contrast, converging indications are found from both CT5 and LAT
data for the emergence of a hard component above 50 GeV in the leading wing
(LW2) of P2, which possibly extends beyond 100 GeV.

recently been used [29] to study the statistical isotropy of temperature and E
mode data from the Planck satellite. The calculation in [29] relied on
stereographic projection of the fields to extract the shape and alignment
information. In this work, we calculate Minkowski Tensors directly on the
sphere and compute the net alignment in the data, based on a recent work that
extends the definition of Minkowski Tensors to random fields on curved spaces.
This method circumvents numerical errors that can be introduced by the
stereographic projection. We compare the resulting net alignment parameter
values obtained from the frequency coadded CMB temperature data cleaned by the
SMICA pipeline, to those obtained from simulations that include instrumental
beam effects and residual foreground and noise. We find very good agreement
between the two within $\approx$ 1$\sigma$ . We further compare the alignments
obtained from the beam-convolved CMB maps at individual Planck frequencies to
those in the corresponding simulations. We find no significant difference
between observed data and simulations across all Planck frequencies, except for
the 30 GHz channel. For the 30 GHz channel we find $\approx$ 2$\sigma$

evolved massive stars passing through the blue supergiant phase are dormant S
Dor variables transforming during a brief period, or whether LBVs are truly
unique objects. By investigating the OGLE light-curves of 64 B supergiants
(Bsgs) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) on a timescale of three years with a
cadence of one night, the incidence of S Dor variables amongst the Bsgs
population is investigated. From our sample, we find just one Bsg, AzV 261,
that displays the photometric behaviour characteristic of S Doradus variables.
We obtain and study a new VLT X-shooter spectrum of AzV 261 in order to
investigate whether the object has changed its effective temperature over the
last decade. We do not find any effective temperature variations indicating
that the object is unlikely to be a LBV S Dor variable. As there is only one
previous bona-fide S Dor variable known to be present in the SMC (R 40), we
find the maximum duration of the LBV phase in the SMC to be at most $\sim$few
10$^3$yrs, or more likely that canonical Bsgs and S Dor LBVs are intrinsically
different objects. We discuss the implications for massive star evolution in
low metallicity environments, characteristic of the early Universe.

long-coherence in superconducting qubits until the development of qubits that
could operate in static, flux noise insensitive configurations commonly
referred to as `sweet-spots'. Several proposals for entangling gates in
superconducting qubits tune the flux bias away from these spots, thus
reintroducing the dephasing problem to varying degrees. Here we revisit one
such proposal, where interactions are parametrically activated by rapidly
modulating the flux bias of the qubits around these sweet-spots, and study the
effect of modulation on the sensitivity to flux noise. We explicitly calculate
how dephasing rates depend on different components of the flux-noise spectrum,
and show that, while these parametric gates are insensitive to $1/f$ flux
noise, dephasing rates are increased under modulation, and dominated by white
noise. Remarkably, we find that simple filtering of the flux control signal
allows for entangling gates to operate in a novel sweet-spot for dephasing
under flux modulation. This sweet spot, which we dub the AC sweet spot, is
insensitive to $1/f$ flux noise, and much less sensitive to white noise in the
control electronics, allowing for interactions of quality that is limited only
by higher order effects and other sources of noise.

In light of recent theoretical developments, we assume that supernova blast
waves undergo blowout without expelling the pre-enriched ambient gas, while
relatively slow winds of massive stars, together with the winds and ejecta from
low to high mass asymptotic-giant-branch stars, are all locally retained in
these less massive systems. Interestingly, we find that the observed Na-O
anti-correlations in metal-poor GCs can be reproduced when multiple episodes of
starburst and enrichment are allowed to continue in these subsystems. A
specific form of star formation history with decreasing time intervals between
the successive stellar generations, however, is required to obtain this result,
which is in good agreement with the parameters obtained from synthetic
horizontal-branch models. The ""mass budget problem"" is also much alleviated by
our models without ad-hoc assumptions on star formation efficiency, initial
mass function, and the preferential loss of first-generation stars. We also
applied these models to investigate the origin of super-He-rich red clump stars
in the metal-rich bulge suggested by Lee et al. (2015). We find that chemical
enrichment by the winds of massive stars can naturally reproduce the required
strong He enhancement in metal-rich subsystems. Our results further underscore
that gas expulsion or retention is a key factor in understanding the multiple

PSBs are typically massive ($M_* > 10^{10}\rm\,M_{\odot}$), very compact and
exhibit high S\'ersic indices, with structures that differ significantly from
their star-forming progenitors but are similar to massive passive galaxies. In
contrast, at lower redshift ($0.5 < z < 1$), PSBs are generally of low mass
($M_* < 10^{10}\rm\,M_{\odot}$) and exhibit compact but less concentrated
profiles (i.e. lower S\'ersic indices), with structures similar to low-mass
passive discs. Furthermore, for both epochs we find remarkably consistent PSB
structure across the optical/near-infrared wavebands (which largely trace
different stellar populations), suggesting that any preceding starburst and/or
quenching in PSBs was not strongly centralized. Taken together, these results
imply that PSBs at $z > 1$ have been recently quenched during a major
disruptive event (e.g. merger or protogalactic collapse) which formed a compact
remnant, while at $z < 1$ an alternative less disruptive process is primarily
responsible. Our results suggest that high-$z$ PSBs are an intrinsically

belts enclose the four gas and ice giants. In the case that a debris disk,
inferred from an infrared excess in the SED, is best modelled as two distinct
temperatures, we infer the presence of two spatially separated rings of debris.
Giant planets may well exist between these two belts of debris, and indeed
could be responsible for the formation of the gap between these belts. We
observe 24 such two-belt systems using the VLT/SPHERE high contrast imager, and
interpret our results under the assumption that the gap is indeed formed by one

calculated, based on the predicted dynamical timescales to clear debris. The
typical dynamical lower limit is $\sim$0.2$M_J$ in this work, and in some cases
exceeds 1$M_J$. Direct imaging data, meanwhile, is typically sensitive to
planets down to $\sim$3.6$M_J$ at 1'', and 1.7$M_J$ in the best case. Together,

while the radiation bath was hot enough to thermally produce dark matter, then
dark matter with larger-than-canonical annihilation cross sections can generate
the observed dark matter relic abundance. To further constrain these scenarios,
we investigate the evolution of small-scale density perturbations during such a
period of kination. We determine that once a perturbation mode enters the
horizon during kination, the gravitational potential drops sharply and begins
to oscillate and decay. Nevertheless, dark matter density perturbations that
enter the horizon during an era of kination grow linearly with the scale factor
prior to the onset of radiation domination. Consequently, kination leaves a
distinctive imprint on the matter power spectrum: scales that enter the horizon
during kination have enhanced inhomogeneity. We also consider how matter
density perturbations evolve when the dominant component of the Universe has a
generic equation-of-state parameter $w$. We find that matter density
perturbations do not grow if they enter the horizon when ${0< w < 1/3}$. If
matter density perturbations enter the horizon when ${w > 1/3}$, their growth
is faster than the logarithmic growth experienced during radiation domination.
The resulting boost to the small-scale matter power spectrum leads to the
formation of enhanced substructure, which effectively increases the dark matter
annihilation rate and could make thermal dark matter production during an era
of kination incompatible with observations.

resonance (or 1/-1 resonance) with the giant planets in the solar system. While
Saturn is the only giant planet whose Trojans are not discovered until now, we
identify some small bodies among Centaurs and Damocloids that are potentially
in 1/-1 resonance with Saturn in the present study. Methods. We integrate
numerically the motion of the 1000 clones (include the nominal orbit) of each
Centaur whose orbit has a semi-major axis between 9.3 au and 9.8 au and an
inclination i > 90 deg. To confirm and evaluate the 1/-1 resonant
configurations mentioned above, we introduce a useful one-degree integrable
approximation for planar 1/-1 resonance. Results. We identify four candidates
potentially in 1/-1 resonance with Saturn. The capture in this particular
resonant state during the 40000 yr integration timespan is very common for 2006
RJ2 (906/1000 clones), 2006 BZ8 (878/1000 clones), and 2017 SV13 (998/1000
clones), and it is less likely for 2012 YE8 (426/1000 clones). According to our
statistical results, 2006 RJ2 is the best candidate to be currently in a 1/-1
mean motion resonance with Saturn, and 2017 SV13 is another important potential
candidate. Moreover, 2012 YE8 and 2006 BZ8 are also Centaurs of interest but
their current and long-term 1/-1 resonant state with Saturn is less likely. The
proportions of the clones captured in the relative long-term stable co-orbit
resonance (over 10000 yr) are also given. Conclusions. Small bodies in
retrograde co-orbit resonance with giant planets may be more common than
previously expected. Identification of these potential mysterious minor bodies
encourages the search for such objects on a larger scale in our solar system.
The findings of this paper are also useful for understanding the origin and

these multi-level abstract representations extracted from all the

unexpected surprise that immediately raised the question - what is the origin
of these black hole binaries? The ""simplest"" scenario is evolution of field
massive stellar binaries. However, other possibilities involving capture have
been proposed. We explore here one of the more interesting clues on this
puzzle: the relatively modest spins of the resulting black holes that imply
that the progenitor black holes were not spinning rapidly. More specifically we
consider the implication of observed distribution of, $\chi_{\rm eff}$, the
mass weighted projected (along the orbital axis) spins on the field evolution
scenario. In all cases $\chi_{\rm eff}$ is small and in two of the cases the
best fit value is negative. Only in one event the spin is positive at 90\%
credible. These observations are puzzling within the field binary scenario in
which positive higher spins ($\chi_{\rm eff} \ge 0.5$) are expected. At first
sight one may expect that this rules out the field evolutionary scenario.
Indeed we show that with typical parameters a significant fraction ($\ge 25\%$)
of the mergers should have high effective spin values. However, uncertainties
in the outcome of the common envelope phase (the typical separation and whether
the stars are rotating or not) and in the late stages of massive star evolution
(the strength of the winds) make it impossible to rule out, at present, these
scenarios. While observations of mergers with high effective spin will support
this scenario, future observations of negative spin mergers would rule it out.

can also provide information about the topological indices of the related
Hamiltonians. As a case study, we study a generalized XY model (2XY model) plus
a generalized Dziyaloshinskii-Moriya-like (DM) interaction that after

We show that the localization length in addition to determining the $Z_2$ can
count the number of Majorana zero modes left over at the boundary of the

Therefore the localization length outperforms the standard topological indices

to customize their hardware accelerators for flexible acceleration of many
workloads. Nonetheless, such advantages come at the cost of sacrificing
programmability. FPGA vendors and researchers attempt to improve the
programmability through high-level synthesis (HLS) technologies that can
directly generate hardware circuits from high-level language descriptions.
However, reading through recent publications on FPGA designs using HLS, one
often gets the impression that FPGA programming is still hard in that it leaves
programmers to explore a very large design space with many possible
combinations of HLS optimization strategies.
  In this paper we make two important observations and contributions. First, we
demonstrate a rather surprising result: FPGA programming can be made easy by
following a simple best-effort guideline of five refinement steps using HLS. We
show that for a broad class of accelerator benchmarks from MachSuite, the
proposed best-effort guideline improves the FPGA accelerator performance by
42-29,030x. Compared to the baseline CPU performance, the FPGA accelerator
performance is improved from an average 292.5x slowdown to an average 34.4x
speedup. Moreover, we show that the refinement steps in the best-effort
guideline, consisting of explicit data caching, customized pipelining,
processing element duplication, computation/communication overlapping and
scratchpad reorganization, correspond well to the best practice guidelines for
multicore CPU programming. Although our best-effort guideline may not always
lead to the optimal solution, it substantially simplifies the FPGA programming
effort, and will greatly support the wide adoption of FPGA-based acceleration
by the software programming community.

Such a large dynamic range leads to a range of over four orders of magnitude in

the extreme adaptivity that cosmological simulations present is tackled in
three main ways through the use of the code SWIFT. First, an adaptive mesh is
used to ensure that only the relevant particles are interacted in a given

load-balancing within a single node, using pthreads and SIMD vectorisation.
Finally, a domain decomposition strategy is presented, using the graph domain
decomposition library METIS, that bisects the work that must be performed by
the simulation between nodes using MPI. These three strategies are shown to
give SWIFT near-perfect weak-scaling characteristics, only losing 25%
performance when scaling from 1 to 4096 cores on a representative problem,

only 166 tornadoes were traced until the end of their lifetime. Out of 166
tornadoes, 80 (48%) triggered CMEs in hosting prominences, 83 (50%) caused
failed coronal mass ejections (CMEs) or strong internal motion in the
prominences, and only 3 (2%) finished their lifetimes without any observed

destabilization of their hosting prominences and half of them trigger CMEs.
Consequently, prominence tornadoes may be used as precursors for CMEs and hence
for space weather predictions.

on static spaces using the $L_2$ distance between interpolating distributions
and the mixing times of Markov kernels. This result is unique in that it is the
first finite sample convergence result for SMC that does not require an upper
bound on the importance weights. Using this bound we show that careful
selection of the interpolating distributions can lead to substantial
improvements in the computational complexity of the algorithm. This result also
justifies the adaptive selection of SMC distributions using the relative
effective sample size commonly used in the literature and we establish
conditions guaranteeing the approximation accuracy of the adaptive SMC
approach. We then demonstrate empirically that this procedure provides
nearly-optimal sequences of distributions in an automatic fashion for realistic
examples.

magnets, the undesired background signal from the substrate can have
significant contribution when characterizing their magnetic properties. This
brings challenges in accurately determining the magnitude of the magnetic
moment of the epitaxially grown van der Waals magnets on bulk substrates. In
this paper, we discuss the impact of the background subtraction method for
accurately determining the magnetic moments in such systems. Using the recently
reported intrinsic two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals ferromagnet MnSe${_2}$ as
an example, we show that a normal diamagnetic background subtraction method in
analyzing the bulk magnetometry measurement will result in an unexpectedly
large magnetic moment (greater than ~10 {\mu}${_B}$ per formula unit). Through
our systematic growth study, we identify an additional paramagnetic signal due
to unintentional Mn doping of the substrate. To extract the correct magnetic
moment, a paramagnetic background should also be considered. This yields a
total magnetic moment of ~4 {\mu}${_B}$ per formula unit in monolayer
MnSe${_2}$, which is in close agreement to the theoretically predicted value.

third order. Despite this, lensing of the CMB power spectrum is an important
effect that needs to be taken into account, which motivates the study of the
impact of lensing on the IM power spectrum. We derive a general formula up to
third order in perturbation theory including all the terms with two derivatives
of the gravitational potential, i.e. the dominant terms on sub-Hubble scales.
We then show that in intensity mapping there is a new lensing term which is not

futuristic surveys like SKA2 is about 10. We find that surveys probing only
large scales, lmax < 700, can safely neglect the lensing of the intensity

differences techniques are being increasingly employed to understand the local
field enhancement factor (FEF) via numerical simulations. In theoretical
analyses, it is usual to consider the emitter as isolated, i.e, a single tip
field emitter infinitely far from any physical boundary, except the substrate.
However, simulation domains must be finite and the simulation boundaries
influences the electrostatic potential distribution. In either finite elements
or finite differences techniques, there is a systematic error ($\epsilon$) in
the FEF caused by the finite size of the simulation domain. It is attempting to
oversize the domain to avoid any influence from the boundaries, however, the
computation might become memory and time consuming, especially in full three
dimensional analyses. In this work, we provide the minimum width and height of
the simulation domain necessary to evaluate the FEF with $\epsilon$ at the
desired tolerance. The minimum width ($A$) and height ($B$) are given relative
to the height of the emitter ($h$), that is, $(A/h)_{min} \times (B/h)_{min}$
necessary to simulate isolated emitters on a substrate. We also provide the
$(B/h)_{min}$ to simulate arrays and the $(A/h)_{min}$ to simulate an emitter
between an anode-cathode planar capacitor. At last, we present the formulae to
obtain the minimal domain size to simulate clusters of emitters with precision
$\epsilon_{tol}$. Our formulae account for ellipsoidal emitters and hemisphere
on cylindrical posts. In the latter case, where an analytical solution is not
known at present, our results are expected to produce an unprecedented
numerical accuracy in the corresponding local FEF.

to drastically speed up deep learning. Their main advantage is that they
compute matrix-vector products in constant time, irrespective of the size of
the matrix. However, early convolution layers in ConvNets map very unfavorably
onto analog arrays, because kernel matrices are typically small and the
constant time operation needs to be sequentially iterated a large number of
times, reducing the speed up advantage for ConvNets. Here, we propose to
replicate the kernel matrix of a convolution layer on distinct analog arrays,
and randomly divide parts of the compute among them, so that multiple kernel
matrices are trained in parallel. With this modification, analog arrays execute
ConvNets with an acceleration factor that is proportional to the number of
kernel matrices used per layer (here tested 16-128). Despite having more free
parameters, we show analytically and in numerical experiments that this
convolution architecture is self-regularizing and implicitly learns similar
filters across arrays. We also report superior performance on a number of
datasets and increased robustness to adversarial attacks. Our investigation
suggests to revise the notion that mixed analog-digital hardware is not

two models of consume rate functions such that the resulting food stock

describe e.g. cell-biological buffer mechanisms, where proteins are stored and

these binary systems. We have thus developed an innovative methodology,
combining a foundation of Bayesian statistics, observed X-ray light-curves, and
accretion disc theory. With this methodology, we characterize the
angular-momentum (and mass) transport processes in an accretion disc, as well
as the properties of the X-ray irradiation-heating that regulates the decay
from outburst maximum in low-mass X-ray transients. We recently applied our
methodology to the Galactic black-hole low-mass X-ray binary population,
deriving from their lightcurves the first-ever quantitative measurements of the
$\alpha$-viscosity parameter in these systems \citep{tetarenko2018}. In this
paper, we continue the study of these binaries, using Bayesian methods to
investigate the X-ray irradiation of their discs during outbursts of strong
accretion. We find that the predictions of the disc-instability model, assuming
a source of X-ray irradiation proportional to the central accretion rate
throughout outburst, do not adequately describe the later stages of BH-LMXB
outburst light-curves. We postulate that the complex and varied light-curve
morphology observed across the population is evidence for irradiation that
varies in time and space within the disc, throughout individual transient
outbursts. Lastly, we demonstrate the robustness of our methodology, by
accurately reproducing the synthetic model light-curves computed from numerical

objects studied in the last few years. The UV emission, revealed by GALEX,
extends well beyond the optical disk, after the drop of H$\alpha$ emission, the
usual tracer of star formation. This shows that sporadic star formation can
occur in a large fraction of the HI disk, at radii up to 3 or 4 times the
optical radius. In most galaxies, these regions are poor in stars and dominated
by under-recycled gas, therefore bear some similarity to early stages of spiral
galaxies and high-redshift galaxies.
  One remarkable example is M83, a nearby galaxy with an extended UV disk
reaching 2 times the optical radius. It offers the opportunity to search for
the molecular gas and characterise the star formation in outer disk regions,
traced by the UV emission. We obtained CO(2-1) observations with
  ALMA of a small region in a 1.5'$\times$ 3' rectangle located at
$r_{gal}=7.85'$ over a bright UV region of M83. There is no CO detection, in
spite of the abundance of HI gas, and the presence of young stars traced by
their HII regions. Our spatial resolution (17pc x 13pc) was perfectly fitted to
detect Giant Molecular Clouds (GMC), but none were detected. The corresponding
upper limits occur in an SFR region of the Kennicutt-Schmidt diagram where
dense molecular clouds are expected. Stacking our data over HI-rich regions,
using the observed HI velocity, we obtain a tentative detection, corresponding
to an H$_2$-to-HI mass ratio of $<$ 3 $\times$ 10$^{-2}$. A possible
explanation is that the expected molecular clouds are CO-dark, because of the
strong UV radiation field. The latter preferentially dissociates CO with
respect to H$_2$, due to the small size of the star forming clumps in the outer
regions of galaxies.

Here, using atomic-resolution analytical scanning transmission electron

contact problem is a fundamental limitation from the bonding and interactions
at the metal-MoS2 interface that cannot be solved by improved deposition
engineering. STEM analysis in conjunction with theory shows that when MoS2 is
in contact with Ti, a metal with a high affinity to form strong bonds with
sulfur, there is a release of S from Mo along with the formation of small
Ti/TixSy clusters. A destruction of the MoS2 layers and penetration of metal
can also be expected. The design of true high-mobility metal-MoS2 contacts will
require the optimal selection of the metal or alloy based on their bonding
interactions with the MoS2 surface. This can be advanced by evaluation of
binding energies with increasing the number of atoms within metal clusters.

production comes from energy sources able to break the strong bond of molecular
nitrogen, and infrared emissions from NO play an important role in
thermospheric cooling. Recent studies have significantly improved our
understanding of NO chemistry and its relationship to energy deposition in the
thermospheric photochemical reactions. In this study, the chemical scheme in
the Global Ionosphere Thermosphere Model (GITM) is updated to better predict
the lower thermospheric NO responses to solar and geomagnetic activity. We
investigate the sensitivity of the 5.3-micron NO emission to F10.7 and Ap
indices by comparing the global integrated emission from GITM with an empirical
proxy derived from the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission
Radiometry measurements. GITM's total emission agrees well within 20% of the
empirical values. The updated chemistry scheme significantly elevates the level
of integrated emission compared to the previous scheme. The inclusion of
N2(A)-related production of NO contributes an additional 5-25% to the emission.
Localized enhancement of ~70% in column density and a factor of three in column

fracture width (w) has been the subject of debate over the past several
decades. An empirical power law has been commonly applied to relate these two
parameters. Its exponent (n) is generally determined by fitting the power-law
function to experimental observations measured at various scales. Invoking
concepts from fractal geometry we theoretically show, as a first- order
approximation, that the fracture aperture should be a linear function of its
width, meaning that n = 1. This finding is in agreement with the result of
linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) theory. We compare the model
predictions with experimental observations available in the literature. This
comparison generally supports a linear relationship between fracture aperture
and fracture width, although there exists considerable scatter in the data. We
also discuss the limitations of the proposed model, and its potential
application to the prediction of flow and transport in fractures. Based on more
than 170 experimental observations from the literature, we show that such a
linear relationship, in combination with the cubic law, is able to scale flow

associated with CMB polarization measurements and how these challenges impact
LTD design. Key aspects of an ideal CMB polarization imaging array are
developed and compared to the current state-of-the-art. These aspects include
dual-polarization-sensitivity, background-limited detection over a 10:1
bandwidth ratio, and frequency independent angular responses. Although existing
technology lacks all of this capability, today's CMB imaging arrays achieve
many of these ideals and are highly advanced superconducting integrated
circuits. Deployed arrays map the sky with pixels that contain elements for
beam formation, polarization diplexing, passband definition in multiple
frequency channels, and bolometric sensing. Several detector architectures are
presented. We comment on the implementation of both transition-edge-sensor
bolometers and microwave kinetic inductance detectors for CMB applications.
Lastly, we discuss fabrication capability in the context of next-generation

visualize the dynamics of network-driven processes is a challenging task. Often
we want to analyze how a single node is influenced by or is influencing its

three stages to allow for an interactive graph exploration: First, a global
solution for the network layout is found in spherical space that minimizes
distance errors between all nodes. Second, a focal node is interactively
selected, and distances to this node are further optimized. Third, node
coordinates are mapped to a circular representation and drawn with additional
features to represent the network-driven phenomenon. The effectiveness and

both accurate (unbiased) and precise (narrow) redshift probability
distributions derived from broadband photometry. Existing methodologies do not
meet those requirements. Standard template fitting delivers interpretable
models and errors, but lacks flexibility to learn inaccuracies in the observed
photometry or the spectral templates. Machine learning addresses those issues,
but requires representative training data, and the resulting models and
uncertainties cannot be interpreted in the context of a physical model or
outside of the training data. We present a hierarchical modeling approach
simultaneously addressing the issues of flexibility, interpretability, and
generalization. It combines template fitting with flexible (machine
learning-like) models to correct the spectral templates, model their redshift
distributions, and recalibrate the photometric observations. By optimizing the
full posterior distribution of the model and solving for its (thousands of)
parameters, one can perform a global statistical calibration of the data and
the SED model. We apply this approach to the public Dark Energy Survey Science
Verification data, and show that it provides more accurate and compact redshift
posterior distributions than existing methods, as well as insights into
residual photometric and SED systematics. The model is causal, makes
predictions for future data (e.g., additional photometric bandpasses), and its
internal parameters and components are interpretable. This approach does not

principle it can even work in regimes in which few or no spectroscopic

gate-induced crossover from weak localization to weak anti-localization in the
magneto-resistance of a high-mobility two-dimensional hole gas in a strained
germanium quantum well. From the magneto-resistance, we extract the
phase-coherence time, spin-orbit precession time, spin-orbit energy splitting,
and cubic Rashba coefficient over a wide density range. The mobility and the
mean free path increase with increasing hole density, while the spin precession
length decreases due to increasingly stronger spin-orbit coupling. As the
density becomes larger than $\sim6\times 10^{11}$cm$^{-2}$, the spin precession
length becomes shorter than the mean free path, and the system enters the
ballistic spin transport regime. We also report here the numerical methods and

consider endmembers that are subspaces as they are capable of capturing a wider

setting thus translates to finding the vertices of the convex hull of a set of

atmospheric characterization of temperate terrestrial exoplanets with the
upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Assessing the potential impact of
stellar contamination on the planets' transit transmission spectra is an
essential precursor step to this characterization. Planetary transits
themselves can be used to scan the stellar photosphere and to constrain its
heterogeneity through transit depth variations in time and wavelength. In this
context, we present our analysis of 169 transits observed in the optical from
space with K2 and from the ground with the SPECULOOS and Liverpool telescopes.
Combining our measured transit depths with literature results gathered in the
mid/near-IR with Spitzer/IRAC and HST/WFC3, we construct the broadband
transmission spectra of the TRAPPIST-1 planets over the 0.8-4.5 $\mu$m spectral
range. While planets b, d, and f spectra show some structures at the 200-300ppm
level, the four others are globally flat. Even if we cannot discard their
instrumental origins, two scenarios seem to be favored by the data: a stellar
photosphere dominated by a few high-latitude giant (cold) spots, or,
alternatively, by a few small and hot (3500-4000K) faculae. In both cases, the
stellar contamination of the transit transmission spectra is expected to be
less dramatic than predicted in recent papers. Nevertheless, based on our
results, stellar contamination can still be of comparable or greater order than
planetary atmospheric signals at certain wavelengths. Understanding and

temperature-dependent order-disorder transition that switches the
particle-particle interaction from repulsive to attractive in solution. In this
work, we examine how changes in the ligand surface coverage and facet
dimensions affect the ordering of ligands, the arrangement of nearby solvent
molecules, and the interaction between ligand monolayers on different
particles. In particular, we consider the case of strongly bound octadecyl
ligands on the (100) facet of CdS in the presence of an explicit n-hexane
solvent. Depending on the facet dimensions and surface coverage, we observe
three distinct ordered states that differ in how the ligands are packed
together, and which affect the thickness of the ligand shell and the structure
of the ligand-solvent interface. The temperature dependence of the
order-disorder transition also broadens and shifts to lower temperature in a
nonlinear manner as the nanoscale is approached from above. We find that
ligands on nanoscale facets can behave very similarly to those on macroscopic
surfaces in solution, and that some facet dimensions affect the ligand
alignment more strongly than others. As the ligands order, the interaction
between opposing monolayers becomes attractive, even well below full surface
coverage. The strength of attraction per unit surface area is strongly affected
by ligand coverage, but only weakly by facet width. Conversely, we find that
bringing two monolayers together just above the order-disorder transition
temperature can induce ordering and attraction.

of a graph $G$ is an assignment of $r$ colors to the vertices of $G$ so that
any two vertices at distance at most two have different colors. Note that a
cubic graph needs at least four colors. The distance-two four-coloring problem
for cubic planar graphs is known to be NP-complete. We claim the problem
remains NP-complete for tri-connected bipartite cubic planar graphs, which we
call type-one Barnette graphs, since they are the first class identified by
Barnette. By contrast, we claim the problem is polynomial for cubic plane
graphs with face sizes $3, 4, 5,$ or $6$, which we call type-two Barnette

Goodey graphs those type-two Barnette graphs all of whose faces have size $4$

four-coloring, and characterize the remaining type-two Barnette graphs that
admit a distance-two four-coloring according to their face size.
  For quartic plane graphs, the analogue of type-two Barnette graphs are graphs
with face sizes $3$ or $4$. For this class, the distance-two four-coloring

particle, modeled as an interval, moving horizontally on a DNA-coated surface,
modelled as a line coated with springs that can stick to the interval.
Averaging over the fast DNA dynamics leads to an evolution equation for the
particle in isolation, which contains both friction and diffusion. The
DNA-induced friction coefficient depends on the physical properties of the DNA,
and substituting parameter values typical of a 1$\mu$m colloid coated densely
with weakly interacting DNA gives a coefficient about 100 times larger than the
corresponding coefficient of hydrodynamic friction. We use a mean-field
extension of the model to higher dimensions to estimate the friction tensor for
a disc rotating and translating horizontally along a line. When the DNA strands
are very stiff and short, the friction coefficient for the disc rolling
approaches zero while the friction for the disc sliding remains large.
Together, these results could have significant implications for the dynamics of
DNA-coated colloids or other ligand-receptor systems, implying that DNA-induced
friction between colloids can be stronger than hydrodynamic friction and should
be incorporated into simulations, and that it depends nontrivially on the type
of relative motion, possibly causing the particles to assemble into
out-of-equilibrium metastable states governed by the pathways with the least
friction.

to generate an output image of desired style strength from the input pair of a
content and a target style image. In the existing methods, the image of
intermediate style between the content and the target style is obtained by
decoding a linearly interpolated feature in encoded feature space. However,
there has been no work on analyzing the effectiveness of this kind of style
strength interpolation so far. In this paper, we tackle the missing work on the
in-depth analysis of style interpolation and propose a method that is more
effective in controlling style strength. We interpret the training task of a
style transfer network as a regression learning between the control parameter
and output style strength. In this understanding, the existing methods are
biased due to the fact that training is performed with one-sided data of full
style strength (alpha = 1.0). Thus, this biased learning does not guarantee the
generation of a desired intermediate style corresponding to the style control
parameter between 0.0 and 1.0. To solve this problem of the biased network, we
propose an unbiased learning technique which uses unbiased training data and
corresponding unbiased loss for alpha = 0.0 to make the feed-forward networks
to generate a zero-style image, i.e., content image when alpha = 0.0. Our
experimental results verified that our unbiased learning method achieved the
reconstruction of a content image with zero style strength, better regression

environment is important for many robotics problems involving navigation and
manipulation. Due to the sparsity of rewards in such tasks, applying
reinforcement learning in these scenarios can be challenging. Common approaches
for tackling this problem include reward engineering with auxiliary rewards,
requiring domain-specific knowledge or changing the objective.
  In this work, we introduce a method based on region-growing that allows
learning in an environment with any pair of initial and goal states. Our
algorithm first learns how to move between nearby states and then increases the
difficulty of the start-goal transitions as the agent's performance improves.
This approach creates an efficient curriculum for learning the objective
behavior of reaching any goal from any initial state. In addition, we describe
a method to adaptively adjust expansion of the growing region that allows
automatic adjustment of the key exploration hyperparameter to environments with
different requirements. We evaluate our approach on a set of simulated
navigation and manipulation tasks, where we demonstrate that our algorithm can
efficiently learn a policy in the presence of sparse rewards.

solar flares by the \emph{Fermi $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope} pose a puzzle and
challenge on the particle acceleration and transport mechanisms. In such
events, the $\gamma$-ray emission region is located away from the BTL flare
site by up to tens of degrees in heliogrpahic longitude. It is thus
hypothesized that particles are accelerated at the shock driven by the coronal
mass ejection (CME) and then travel from the shock downstream back to the front
side of the Sun to produce the observed $\gamma$-rays. To test this scenario,
we performed data-driven, global magnetohydrodynamics simulations of the CME
associated with a well-observed BTL flare on 2014 September 1. We found that
part of the CME-driven shock develops magnetic connectivity with the
$\gamma$-ray emission region, facilitating transport of particles back to the
Sun. Moreover, the observed increase in $\gamma$-ray flux is temporally
correlated with (1) the increase of the shock compression ratio and (2) the
presence of a quasi-perpendicular shock over the area that is magnetically
connected to the $\gamma$-ray emitting region, both conditions favoring the
diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) of particles. These results support the
above hypothesis and can help resolve another puzzle, i.e., long-duration (up
to 20 hours) $\gamma$-rays flares. We suggest that, in addition to DSA,
stochastic acceleration by plasma turbulence may also play a role, especially
in the shock downstream region and during the early stage when the shock
Alfv\'{e}n Mach number is small.

I migration rates at the time the gas dissipates. In this second work we focus
on the late accretion stage of SSAs using the results obtained in PI as initial

the formation of rocky planets and their final water contents within the

the efficiency in forming PHPs is directly related to the size of the
planetesimals. The smaller the planetesimals, the greater the efficiency in
forming PHPs. We also analyze the sensitivity of our results to scenarios with
type I migration rates and gap-opening giants, finding that both phenomena act
in a similar way. These effects seem to favor the formation of PHPs for small

This work aims to investigate the full spatial multiplexing gain in
multi-antenna coded caching by transmitting all coded messages concurrently. In
specific, we propose to treat the content delivery as the transmission problem
with general message sets where all possible messages are present, each with
different length and intended for different user set. We first obtain inner and
outer bounds of the degrees of freedom (DoF) region of a $K$-user $(M,N)$
broadcast channel with general message sets, with $M$ and $N$ being the number
of transmit and receive antennas, respectively. Then for any given set of coded
messages, we find its minimum normalized delivery time (NDT) by searching the
optimal DoF tuple in the DoF regions. The obtained minimum NDT is optimal at
antenna configuration $\frac{M}{N} \in (0,1]\cup[K, \infty)$ and is within a
multiplicative gap of $\frac{M}{N}$ to optimum at $\frac{M}{N} \in (1,K)$. Our
NDT results can be evaluated for any user demand with both centralized and

magnetic flux in an active region (AR). We introduce a new parameter
$\kappa^\ast$, as a proxy for $\kappa$, and we have analyzed the evolution of

reconstruct an unknown signal. Existing approaches leverage assumptions on the
structure of these signals, such as sparsity or the availability of a
generative model. A domain-specific generative model can provide a stronger
prior and thus allow for recovery with far fewer measurements. However, unlike
sparsity-based approaches, existing methods based on generative models
guarantee exact recovery only over their support, which is typically only a
small subset of the space on which the signals are defined. We propose
Sparse-Gen, a framework that allows for sparse deviations from the support set,
thereby achieving the best of both worlds by using a domain specific prior and
allowing reconstruction over the full space of signals. Theoretically, our
framework provides a new class of signals that can be acquired using compressed
sensing, reducing classic sparse vector recovery to a special case and avoiding
the restrictive support due to a generative model prior. Empirically, we
observe consistent improvements in reconstruction accuracy over competing
approaches, especially in the more practical setting of transfer compressed
sensing where a generative model for a data-rich, source domain aids sensing on
a data-scarce, target domain.

studying the critical behavior using standard techniques such as, modified

our analysis show the exponent $\beta$ related to spontaneous magnetization
increases while the exponents $\gamma$ and $\delta$ related to initial inverse
susceptibility and critical magnetization, respectively decrease with Ti

theoretical models for universality classes, however, the exponent obey the

subpopulations with different elemental abundances, including, in some cases,
in elements such as iron that are produced by supernovae. This paper presents a
theoretical model for GC formation motivated by observations of Milky Way star
forming regions and simulations of star formation, where giant molecular clouds
fragment into multiple clumps which undergo star formation at slightly
different times. Core collapse supernovae from earlier-forming clumps can
enrich later-forming clumps to the degree that the ejecta can be retained
within the gravitational potential well, resulting in subpopulations with
different total metallicities once the clumps merge to form the final cluster.
The model matches the mass-metallicity relation seen in GC populations around
massive elliptical galaxies, and predicts metallicity spreads within clusters
in excellent agreement with those seen in Milky Way GCs, even for those whose
internal abundance spreads are so large that their entire identity as a GC is
in question. The internal metallicity spread serves as an excellent measurement
of how much self-enrichment has occurred in a cluster, a result that is very
robust to variation in the model parameters.

new class of deterministic individual based models describing individual births
and deaths, which captures the essential features of standard stochastic
individual-based models and become identical with the latter under maximal
competition. The key motivation is to derive the canonical equation of adaptive
dynamics from this microscopic ecological model, which can be regarded as a
""toy model"" for evolution, in a simple way and give it an intuitive geometric
interpretation. Another goal is to study evolution and sympatric speciation
under ""maximal"" competition. We show that these models, in the deterministic
limit of adaptive dynamics, lead to the same equations that describe the
unraveling of the mean evolutionary trajectory as those obtained from the
standard stochastic models. We further study conditions under which these
models lead to evolutionary branching and find them to be similar with those
obtained from the standard stochastic models. We find that though deterministic
models result in a strong competition that leads to a speed up in the temporal
dynamics of a population cloud in the phenotypic space as well as an increase
in the rate of generation of biodiversity, it does not seem to result in an
absolute increase in biodiversity as far as total number of species are
concerned. Hence, the ""toy model"" essentially captures all the features of the

quantum and classical plasmas consisting of one or two populations of electrons

plasma longitudinal susceptibility, we assess the effects due to increasing
complexity of the background distribution function. Firstly, we analyse
dispersion and Landau damping in one-component plasmas and consider
distribution functions with a variety of analytical properties: the Dirac delta
function, the Cauchy profile with two complex first-order poles, the squared
Cauchy profile with two second order poles, and the inverse-quartic profile
with four first-order poles; we also briefly discuss the non-meromorphic
totally- and arbitrarily-degenerate Fermi-Dirac distribution. In order to study
electrostatic instabilities, we then turn to plasmas with two populations of
electrons streaming relative to each other in two cases: a symmetric case of
two counter-streaming identical populations and a bump-on-tail case with a
primary population and a delta-function beam. We obtain the corresponding
linear kinetic dispersion relations and evaluate the properties of
instabilities when the electron distribution functions are of the delta
function, Cauchy, squared-Cauchy, or inverse-quartic types. In agreement with
other studies, we find that in general quantum effects reduce the range of
wavelengths for unstable modes at long wavelengths. We also find a second
window of instability at shorter wavelengths and elucidate its nature as being

deep hashing model, named deep saliency hashing (DSaH), which automatically
mines salient regions and learns semantic-preserving hashing codes
simultaneously. DSaH is a two-step end-to-end model consisting of an attention
network and a hashing network. Our loss function contains three basic
components, including the semantic loss, the saliency loss, and the
quantization loss. As the core of DSaH, the saliency loss guides the attention
network to mine discriminative regions from pairs of images. We conduct
extensive experiments on both fine-grained and general retrieval datasets for
performance evaluation. Experimental results on fine-grained datasets,
including Oxford Flowers-17, Stanford Dogs-120, and CUB Bird demonstrate that
our DSaH performs the best for fine-grained retrieval task and beats the
strongest competitor (DTQ) by approximately 10% on both Stanford Dogs-120 and
CUB Bird. DSaH is also comparable to several state-of-the-art hashing methods
on general datasets, including CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE.

<0.05-0.1. We also find that the late-time radio data of these interacting SNe

diffusive shock acceleration in dense environments as well as pre-SN mass-loss

Moreover, mmWave signals are typically directional, to benefit from beamforming
gain, and require frequent realignment of the beams to maintain connectivity.
These limitations are particularly challenging when considering
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) transmissions, because of the highly mobile nature of

index of a single activated transmitter nanomachine. The concentration symbol
is drawn according to the conventional concentration shift keying (CSK)

neuroscience, there are three general neuron models in the field: Compartmental
neuron model is a conductance-based model, in which it views the biological
neurons as a large circuit. The problem of this model comes from its structural
complexity and the number of its free parameters; Leaky integrated and firing
model is a more flexible model due to the special design called
threshold-resetting, in which the voltage of the neuron is reset after reaching
the threshold. This model is proposed as an alternative to the compartment
model to provide a more biologically realistic model that can capture spike
timing behaviors that are observed in experiments. In addition to that, it is
more computationally efficient since it has much less free parameters; Firing
rate-based neuron model uses the firing rate of the neuron as the coupling
terms in the coupled neuronal network models. Models of this kind can be easily
analyzed on the network level. Theoretical analysis for this model proves the
existence of phase transition and shows that the computational capacity is

distances between the planets and their host star by expanding the original
orbit, by contracting it (which may cause an engulfment of the planet by the
star), or by destroying the planet. We study the evolution of the orbit of a
planet orbiting its host star under the effects of equilibrium tides, dynamical
tides, drag (frictional and gravitational), and stellar mass loss. We used the
Geneva stellar evolution code to compute the evolution of stars with initial
masses of 1 and 1.5 solar mass with different rotation rates at solar
metallicity. The star is evolved from the pre-main-sequence (PMS) up to the tip
of the red giant branch. We used these models as input for computing the
evolution of the planetary orbits. We explored the effects of changing the
planet masses (of 1 Earth mass up to 20 Jupiter masses), the distance between
the planet and the star (of 0.015 and more than 3 au), the mass, and the spin
of the star. We present results when only the equilibrium tide was accounted
for and when both equilibrium and dynamical tides were accounted for. The
expression for the dynamical tide is a frequency-averaged dissipation of
tidally excited inertial waves, obtained from a piecewise homogeneous two-layer
stellar model. Gravity wave damping was neglected. Dynamical tides in
convective zones have a significant effect on planetary orbits only during the
PMS phase and only for fast-rotating stars. They have no significant effects
during the PMS phase for initially slow-rotating stars and during the red giant
branch phase, regardless of the initial rotation (abridged).

from the pc scales to many tens of kpc. Given the strong radio continuum often
associated with the central activity, HI absorption can be used to study the HI
near an AGN out to much higher redshifts than is possible using HI emission. HI
absorption has been used to characterise the general ISM in active galaxies, to
trace the fuelling of radio-loud AGN, to study the feedback between the energy
released by the AGN and the ISM, and the impact of such interactions on the
evolution of galaxies and their AGN. In the last two decades, significant
progress has been made in all these areas. It is now well established that many
radio loud AGN are surrounded by small, regularly rotating gas disks that
contain a significant fraction of HI. The structure of these disks has been
traced down to parsec scales by VLBI observations. Young and recently restarted
radio galaxies appear to have a high detection rate of HI. This is interesting
in connection with the evolution of these AGN. This is confirmed by the
discovery of fast, AGN-driven outflows of cold gas which give a direct view of
the impact of the energy released by AGN. In addition, evidence has been
collected that clouds of cold gas can play a role in fuelling the nuclear
activity. This review ends by briefly describing the upcoming large, blind HI
absorption surveys planned for the new radio telescopes which will soon become
operational. These surveys will allow to significantly expand existing work,
but will also allow to explore new topics, in particular the evolution of the
cold ISM in AGN.

applied in various real-world applications. They can learn the model adaptively
and be better fit for special requirements of different tasks. Generally, a
good machine learning system is composed of plentiful training data, a good
model training process, and an accurate inference. Many factors can affect the
performance of the machine learning process, among which the diversity of the
machine learning process is an important one. The diversity can help each
procedure to guarantee a total good machine learning: diversity of the training
data ensures that the training data can provide more discriminative information
for the model, diversity of the learned model (diversity in parameters of each
model or diversity among different base models) makes each parameter/model
capture unique or complement information and the diversity in inference can
provide multiple choices each of which corresponds to a specific plausible
local optimal result. Even though the diversity plays an important role in
machine learning process, there is no systematical analysis of the
diversification in machine learning system. In this paper, we systematically
summarize the methods to make data diversification, model diversification, and
inference diversification in the machine learning process, respectively. In
addition, the typical applications where the diversity technology improved the
machine learning performance have been surveyed, including the remote sensing
imaging tasks, machine translation, camera relocalization, image segmentation,
object detection, topic modeling, and others. Finally, we discuss some
challenges of the diversity technology in machine learning and point out some
directions in future work.

straightforward framework to solve distance-related problems on planar graphs:
Replace the input graph with the distance emulator, and apply whatever

considering that both networks presumably share similar single-neuron dynamics

virtually isolated, whereas in vivo every brain area receives continuous input.
We analyze a model of spiking neurons in which the input strength, mediated by
spike rate homeostasis, determines the characteristics of the dynamical state.
In more detail, our analytical and numerical results on various network
topologies show consistently that under increasing input, homeostatic
plasticity generates distinct dynamic states, from bursting, to
close-to-critical, reverberating and irregular states. This implies that the
dynamic state of a neural network is not fixed but can readily adapt to the
input strengths. Indeed, our results match experimental spike recordings in
vitro and in vivo: the in vitro bursting behavior is consistent with a state
generated by very low network input (< 0.1%), whereas in vivo activity suggests
that on the order of 1% recorded spikes are input-driven, resulting in
reverberating dynamics. Importantly, this predicts that one can abolish the
ubiquitous bursts of in vitro preparations, and instead impose dynamics
comparable to in vivo activity by exposing the system to weak long-term

particle physics or cosmology is the emergence of a fifth force. While generic
fifth forces are tightly constrained at Solar System scales and below, they may
escape detection by means of a screening mechanism which effectively removes
them in dense environments. We constrain the strength $\Delta G/G_N$ and range
$\lambda_C$ of a chameleon- or symmetron-screened fifth force with Yukawa
coupling -- as well as an unscreened fifth force with differential coupling to
galactic mass components -- by searching for the displacement it predicts
between galaxies' stellar and gas mass centroids. Taking data from the Alfalfa
HI survey, identifying galaxies' gravitational environments with the maps of
Desmond et al. (2018a) and forward-modelling with a Bayesian likelihood
framework, we find $6.6\sigma$ evidence for $\Delta G>0$ at $\lambda_C \simeq
2$ Mpc, with $\Delta G/G_N = 0.025$ at maximum-likelihood. A similar
fifth-force model without screening gives no increase in likelihood over the
case $\Delta G = 0$ for any $\lambda_C$. Although we validate these results by
several methods, we do not claim screened modified gravity to provide the only
possible explanation for the signal: this would require knowing that ""galaxy
formation"" physics could not be responsible. We show also the results of a more
conservative -- though less well motivated -- noise model which yields only
upper limits on $\Delta G/G_N$, ranging from $\sim10^{-1}$ for $\lambda_C
\simeq 0.5$ Mpc to $\sim \: \text{few} \times 10^{-4}$ at $\lambda_C \simeq 50$
Mpc. We show how these constraints may be improved by future galaxy surveys and
identify the key features of an observational programme for directly
constraining fifth forces on galactic scales. This paper provides a complete

Lagrangian method developed in \cite{Atmaja:2015umo}. We add into the original
BPS Lagrangian $L_{BPS}=\int dQ$, which is a total derivative term, two
additional terms that are proportional to square of the first-derivative of
scalar effective field, $f'(r)^2$, and to a function that depends only on the
scalar effective field. These additional terms produce additional constraint
equations coming from Euler-Lagrange equations of the BPS Lagrangian. We apply
this procedure for the generalized Born-Infeld-Higgs model and show that the
total static energy, for the corresponding BPS equations, is finite if the
scalar potential $V< 2b^2$, with $b$ is the Born-Infeld parameter. We also
compute the energy-momentum tensor and show that its diagonal spatial
components in radial and angular directions are nonzero. Furthermore we show
that the conservation of energy-momentum does not produce new constraint
equation. We do the numerical analysis and found that for a large class of
solutions the scalar and gauge effective fields, $f(r)$ and $a(r)$, behave
nicely near the origin, but unfortunately they are infinite near the boundary.
We suggest that incorporate gravity into the action might resolve this problem
and other resolution is by considering BPS vortex in higher dimensional models.
We also suggest that the BPS Lagrangian method could be used to find BPS
equations for other solitons with nonzero stress tensor.

the dual AGN (DAGN) of the local volume. Our analysis is based on the premise
that the essential aspects of this scenario can be captured by replacing the
physics of the central BH with restrictions on their relative separation in
phase space. We introduce several estimates of the DAGN fraction and infer
predictions for the activity levels and resolution limits usually involved in
surveys of these systems, assessing their dependence on the parameters
controlling the length of both mergers and nuclear activity. Given a set of
constraints, we find that the values adopted for some of the latter factors
often condition the outcomes from individual experiments. Still, the results do
not reveal, in general, very tight correlations, being the tendency of the
frequencies normalized to the merger time to anticorrelate with the orbital
circularity the clearest effect. In agreement with other theoretical studies,
our simulations predict intrinsic abundances of these systems that range from
$\sim$few to $15\%$ depending on the maximum level of nuclear activity
achieved. At the same time, we show that these probabilities are reduced by
about an order of magnitude when they are filtered with the typical constraints
applied by observational studies of the DAGN fraction at low redshift. As a
whole, the results of the present work prove that the consideration of the most

plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity, experimental evidence indicates
that NMDAR-mediated calcium influx also modifies neuronal excitability through
the activation of calcium-activated potassium channels. This mechanism has not
yet been studied theoretically. Our theoretical model provides a simple
description of neuronal electrical activity that takes into account the tonic
activity of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors and a cytosolic calcium compartment.
We show that calcium influx mediated by the tonic activity of NMDA-R can be
coupled directly to the activation of calcium-activated potassium channels,
resulting in an overall inhibitory effect on neuronal excitability.
Furthermore, the presence of tonic NMDA-R activity promotes bistability in
electrical activity by dramatically increasing the stimulus interval where both
a stable steady state and repetitive firing can coexist. These results could
provide an intrinsic mechanism for the constitution of memory traces in
neuronal circuits. They also shed light on the way by which $\beta$-amyloids

network as a feature encoder and a perceptual loss network. Although the
pre-trained network is used to generate responses of receptive fields effective

style transfer but rather for image classification. Furthermore, it also
requires a time-consuming and correlation-considering feature alignment process
for image style transfer because of its inter-channel correlation. In this
paper, we propose an end-to-end learning method which optimizes an
encoder/decoder network for the purpose of style transfer as well as relieves
the feature alignment complexity from considering inter-channel correlation. We
used uncorrelation loss, i.e., the total correlation coefficient between the
responses of different encoder channels, with style and content losses for
training style transfer network. This makes the encoder network to be trained
to generate inter-channel uncorrelated features and to be optimized for the
task of image style transfer which maintained the quality of image style only
with a light-weighted and correlation-unaware feature alignment process.
Moreover, our method drastically reduced redundant channels of the encoded
feature and this resulted in the efficient size of structure of network and
faster forward processing speed. Our method can also be applied to cascade
network scheme for multiple scaled style transferring and allows user-control
of style strength by using a content-style trade-off parameter.

Furthermore, most of our results are themselves finistic, being theorems of

quantitative computational description of this important property has proven
difficult, in part due to the large unit cell, the role of disorder, and the
fact that both electronic carriers and phonons contribute to transport. Here,
we conduct a systematic analysis of the temperature and composition dependence

largely focused on the rattler modes, here, it is shown that at room
temperatures modes with $\hbar\omega\gtrsim\,10\,\text{meV}$ account for 50\%\
of lattice heat transport. Finally, the electronic contribution to the thermal
conductivity is computed, which shows the Wiedemann-Franz law to be only

globally more realistic in at least two senses: real and synthetic instances
are harder to tell apart by Random Forests, and the MMD statistic. The most
likely explanation is that our method does not suffer from the ""mode collapse""
which is an admitted problem of GANs. Additionally, the generative models we
generate are easy to interpret, unlike the rather obscure GANs. Our experiments
are performed on two patient datasets containing ICD-9 diagnostic codes: the
publicly available MIMIC-III dataset and a dataset containing admissions for
congestive heart failure during 7 years at Hospital de Sant Pau in Barcelona.

psychometric personality questionnaires. With TYDR, we track a larger variety

development of TYDR, we introduce a general context data model consisting of
four categories that focus on the user's different types of interactions with

functions usage, and app usage. On top of this, we develop the privacy model
PM-MoDaC specifically for apps related to the collection of mobile data,
consisting of nine proposed privacy measures. We present the implementation of
all of those measures in TYDR. Although the utilization of the user's

does not commute with other quantum operators essential for the definition of

properties of a measure of time---the Chern-Simons time---and the fact that in
some theories it appears as a conjugate to the cosmological constant, with the
two promoted to non-commuting quantum operators. Thus, the Universe may be
""delocalised"" in time: it does not {\it know} the time, a property which opens
up new cosmological scenarios, as well as invalidating several paradoxes, such
as the timelike tower of turtles associated with an omnipresent time line.
Alternatively, a Universe with a sharply defined clock time must have an
indeterminate cosmological constant. The challenge then is to explain how
islands of localized time may emerge, and give rise to localized histories. In
some scenarios this is achieved by backward transitions in quantum time,
cycling the Universe in something akin to a time machine cycle, with classical
flow and quantum ebbing. The emergence on matter in a sea of Lambda probably
provides the ballast behind classical behaviour.

the SAMI data with stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), effective radius

their relation to the metallicity and ionization parameter. We find a weak
trend of steepening metallicity gradient with galaxy stellar mass, with values
ranging from -0.03 to -0.20 dex/R$_e$. Only two galaxies show radial gradients
in ionization parameter. We find that the ionization parameter has no
significant correlation with either SFR, sSFR (specific star formation rate),
or metallicity. For several individual galaxies we find structure in the
ionization parameter maps suggestive of spiral arm features. We find a typical
ionization parameter range of $7.0 < \log(q) < 7.8$ for our galaxy sample with
no significant overall structure. An ionization parameter range of this
magnitude is large enough to caution the use of metallicity diagnostics which

the linear hyperbolic transport equations. The linear transport equation
naturally allows discontinuous solutions and discontinuous inflow conditions,
while the normal component of the flux across the mesh faces needs to be
continuous. Traditional LSFEMs using continuous finite element approximations
will introduce unnecessary extra error for discontinuous solutions and boundary
conditions. In order to separate the continuity requirements, a new flux
variable is introduced. With this reformulation, the continuities of the flux
and the solution can be handled separately in natural
$H(\mbox{div};\Omega)\times L^2(\Omega)$ conforming finite element spaces.
Several variants of the methods are developed to handle the inflow boundary
condition strongly or weakly.
  With the reformulation, the new LSFEMs can handle discontinuous solutions and
boundary conditions much better than the traditional LSFEMs with continuous
polynomial approximations. With least-squares functionals as a posteriori error
estimators, the adaptive methods can naturally identify error sources including
singularity and non-matching discontinuity. For discontinuity aligned mesh, no
extra error is introduced. If an $RT_0 \times P_0$ pair is used to approximate
the flux and the solution, the new adaptive LSFEMs can approximate
discontinuous solutions with almost no overshooting even when the mesh is not
aligned with discontinuity.
  Existence and uniqueness of the solutions and a priori and a posteriori error
estimates are established for the proposed methods. Extensive numerical tests
are performed to show the effectiveness of the methods developed in the paper.

contacting hosts in a certain period, is bigger than a threshold. Super point
cardinality estimation plays important roles in network field. This paper
proposes a super point cardinality estimation algorithm under sliding time
window. To maintain the state of previous hosts with few updating operations, a
novel counter, asynchronous time stamp (AT), is proposed. For a sliding time
window containing k time slices, AT only needs to be updated every k time
slices at the cost of 1 more bit than a previous state-of-art counter which
requires $log_2(k+1)$ bits but updates every time slice. Fewer updating
operations mean that more AT could be contained to acquire higher accuracy in
real-time. This paper also devises a novel reversible hash function scheme to
restore super point from a pool of AT. Experiments on several real-world
network traffic illustrate that the algorithm proposed in this paper could
detect super points and estimate their cardinalities under sliding time window

is realised by the controlled transfer of the photonic excitations into a
metastable state of an atom confined inside the cavity and occurs via a Raman
transition with a suitably tailored laser pulse, which drives the atom and
minimizes reflection at the cavity mirror. We determine the storage efficiency

single-photon storage. We determine the figures of merit and we identify the
conditions on an arbitrary pulse for which the storage dynamics approaches the

precise sense captures its canonical notion of size, akin to the cardinality of
a set. The Euler characteristic is closely related to the homology of a space,
as it can be expressed as the alternating sum of its Betti numbers, whenever
the sum is well-defined. Thus, one says that homology categorifies the Euler
characteristic. In his work on the generalisation of cardinality-like
invariants, Leinster introduced the magnitude of a metric space, a real number
that counts the ""effective number of points"" of the space and has been shown to
encode many invariants of metric spaces from integral geometry and geometric
measure theory. In 2015, Hepworth and Willerton introduced a homology theory
for metric graphs, called magnitude homology, which categorifies the magnitude
of a finite metric graph. This work was subsequently generalised to enriched
categories by Leinster and Shulman, and the homology theory that they
introduced categorifies magnitude for arbitrary finite metric spaces. When
studying a metric space, one is often only interested in the metric space up to
a rescaling of the distance of the points by a non-negative real number. The
magnitude function describes how the effective number of points changes as one
scales the distance, and is completely encoded by magnitude homology. When
studying a finite metric space in topological data analysis using persistent
homology, one approximates the space through a nested sequence of simplicial
complexes so as to recover topological information about the space by studying
the homology of this sequence. Here we relate magnitude homology and persistent
homology as two different ways of computing homology of filtered simplicial
sets.

discovered recently in the ultra-faint (UFD) galaxy Pisces II. This galaxy is
supposed to be very old, suspected to include dark matter, and likely formed
the bulk of its stars before the reionisation of the Universe.
  New abundances have been obtained from observations of Pisces II 10694 at the
Kueyen ESO VLT telescope, using the high-efficiency spectrograph: X-Shooter.
  We found that Pisces II 10694 is a CEMP-no star with [Fe/H]=-2.60 dex.
Careful measurements of the CH and C2 bands confirm the enhancement of the C
abundance ([C/Fe]=+1.23). This cool giant has very probably undergone extra
mixing and thus its original C abundance could be even higher. Nitrogen, O, Na,
and Mg are also strongly enhanced, but from Ca to Ni the ratios [X/Fe] are
similar to those observed in classical galactic very metal-poor stars. With its
low Ba abundance ([Ba/Fe] =-1.10 dex) Pisces II 10694 is a CEMP-no star. No
variation in the radial velocity could be detected between the years 2015 and
2017. The pattern of the elements abundance has a shape similar to the pattern
found in galactic CEMP-no stars like CS 22949-037 ([Fe/H]=-4.0) or SDSS
J1349+1407 ([Fe/H]=-3.6). The existence of a CEMP-no star in the UFD galaxy
Pisc II suggests that this small galaxy likely hosted zero-metallicity stars.
This is consistent with theoretical predictions of cosmological models
supporting the idea that UFD galaxies are the living fossils of the first
star-forming systems.

of its practical significance for space weather and as a test of our
theoretical understanding of the solar cycle. The Babcock-Leighton mechanism
allows predictions by assimilating the observed magnetic field on the surface.
But the emergence of sunspot groups has the random properties, which make it
impossible to accurately predict the solar cycle and also strongly limit the
scope of cycle predictions. Hence we develop the scheme to investigate the
predictability of the solar cycle over one cycle. When a cycle has been ongoing
for more than 3 years, the sunspot group emergence can be predicted along with
its uncertainty during the rest time of the cycle. The method for doing this is
to start by generating a set of random realizations which obey the statistical
relations of the sunspot emergence. We then use a surface flux transport model
to calculate the possible axial dipole moment evolutions. The correlation
between the axial dipole moment at cycle minimum and the subsequent cycle
strength and other empirical properties of solar cycles are used to predict the
possible profiles of the subsequent cycle. We apply this scheme to predict the
large-scale field evolution from 2018 to the end of cycle 25, whose maximum
strength is expected to lie in the range from 93 to 155 with a probability of
95\%.

associated with potentially variable radius and orientation. Such geometry
attributes are estimated via a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) model. In

over $\Bbb C$, with all roots distinct. Let $E_p(A) := \{a \in A \mid p(a) =

1)~similarity via a finite product of exponential functions (via an exponential
function); 2)~a polynomial path (a cubic polynomial path); 3)~a polygonal path
(a polygonal path consisting of $n$ segments). If $A$ is a $C^*$-algebra,
$\lambda_i \in \Bbb R$, let $S_p(A):= \{a\in A \mid a = a^*$, $p(a) = 0\}$.
Then all connected components of $S_p(A)$ are pathwise connected (locally

ae^{ic_1t}\dots e^{ic_mt}$, where $c_i = c_i^*$, and $t \in [0, 1]$ (of the
form $e^{-ict} ae^{ict}$, where $c = c^*$, and $t \in [0,1]$). For
(self-adjoint) idempotents we have by these old papers that the distance of
different connected components of them is at least~$1$. For $E_p(A)$, $S_p(A)$
we pose the problem if the distance of different connected components is at
least $\min \bigl\{|\lambda_i - \lambda_j| \mid 1 \leq i,j \leq n, \ i \neq
j\bigr\}$. For the case of $S_p(A)$, we give a positive lower bound for these
distances, that depends on $\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n$. We show that several
local and global lifting theorems for analytic families of idempotents, along
analytic families of surjective Banach algebra homomorphisms, from our recent
paper with B. Aupetit and M. Mbekhta, have analogues for elements of $E_p(A)$

0.16 - 0.59 mag in B band. For the flickering source we find that it has colour
-0.14 < B-V < 0.40, temperature in the range 7200 < T_fl < 18900, and average
radius 1.1 < R_fl < 6.7 R_sun. We do not find a correlation between the
temperature of the flickering and the brightness. However, we do find a strong
correlation (correlation coefficient 0.81, significance 1.1x10^{-7} ) between B
band magnitude and the average radius of the flickering source - as the
brightness of the system increases the size of the flickering source also
increases. The estimated temperature is similar to that of the bright spot of
cataclysmic variables. The persistent presence of flickering indicates that the
white dwarf is actively accreting material for the next outburst.

report their sensed data via Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)
scheme to a sink node on the water surface. Furthermore, due to the presence of
a passive malicious node in nearby vicinity, the multi-hop UnderWater Acoustic
(UWA) channel between a sensor node and the sink node is prone to eavesdropping
attack on each hop. Therefore, the problem at hand is to do (helper/relay) node
selection (for data forwarding onto the next hop) as well as power allocation
(across the OFDM sub-carriers) in a way that the secrecy rate is maximized at
each hop. To this end, this problem of Node Selection and Power Allocation
(NSPA) is formulated as a mixed binary-integer optimization program, which is
then optimally solved via decomposition approach, and by exploiting duality
theory along with the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. We also provide a
computationally-efficient, sub-optimal solution to the NSPA problem, where we
reformulate it as a mixed-integer linear program and solve it via decomposition
and geometric approach. Moreover, when the UWA channel is multipath (and not
just line-of-sight), we investigate an additional, machine learning-based
approach to solve the NSPA problem. Finally, we compute the computational
complexity of all the three proposed schemes (optimal, sub-optimal, and
learning-based), and do extensive simulations to compare their performance
against each other and against the baseline schemes (which allocate equal power
to all the sub-carriers and do depth-based node selection). In a nutshell, this
work proposes various (optimal and sub-optimal) methods for providing
information-theoretic security at the physical layer of the protocol stack

direct time-dependent forcing of the system itself. After general
considerations of driven Caldeira-Leggett baths, we consider the Rubin model of
a chain of quantum particles coupled by linear springs as an important model of
a quantum dissipative system. We show that in the presence of time-dependent
driving of the chain, this model can be mapped to a quantum system which
couples to a driven Caldeira-Leggett bath. The effect of the bath driving is
captured by a time-dependent force on the central system, which is, in
principle, non-Markovian in nature. We study two specific examples, the exactly
solvable case of a harmonic potential, and a quantum two-state system for which
we assume a weak system-bath coupling. We evaluate the dynamical response to a
periodic driving of the system and the bath. The dynamic susceptibility is
shown to be altered qualitatively by the bath drive: The dispersive part is
enhanced at low frequencies and acquires a maximum at zero frequency. The
absorptive part develops a shoulder-like behavior in this frequency regime.
These features seem to be generic for quantum systems in a driven
Caldeira-Leggett bath.

choose k-mers counting as a case study for our analysis, and Spark as the
framework to implement FastKmer, a novel approach for the extraction of k-mer
statistics from large collection of biological sequences, with arbitrary values

a module for balancing the statistics aggregation workload over the nodes of a

results of a comparative experimental analysis showing that our approach is
currently the fastest among the ones based on Big Data technologies, while

annihilation into hadrons below charm are obtained from the Adler function,
which at present is known in the chiral limit to five-loop accuracy.
Extractions of the strong coupling, $\alpha_s$, from these processes suffer
from an ambiguity related to the treatment of unknown higher orders in the
perturbative series. In this work, we exploit the method of Pad\'e approximants
and its convergence theorems to extract information about higher-order
corrections to the Adler function in a systematic way. First, the method is
tested in the large-$\beta_0$ limit of QCD, where the perturbative series is
known to all orders. We devise strategies to accelerate the convergence of the
method employing renormalization scheme variations and the so-called D-log
Pad\'e approximants. The success of these strategies can be understood in terms
of the analytic structure of the series in the Borel plane. We then apply the
method to full QCD and obtain reliable model-independent predictions for the
higher-order coefficients of the Adler function. For the six-, seven-, and
eight-loop coefficients we find $c_{5,1} = 277\pm 51$, $c_{6,1}=3460\pm 690$,
and $c_{7,1}=(2.02\pm0.72)\times 10^4$, respectively, with errors to be
understood as lower and upper bounds. Our model-independent reconstruction of
the perturbative QCD corrections to the $\tau$ hadronic width strongly favours
the use of fixed-order perturbation theory (FOPT) for the renormalization-scale
setting.

degradation of its sensitivity in the observation of faint extended sources

investigate the aeroelastic instabilities generated by the flow around a moving
NACA0012 airfoil. The profile has a chord length of $c=0.1 m and is exposed to
a flow at a Reynolds number of Re=30,000. The airfoil has only two degrees of
freedom: Translation in relation to the vertical direction and a rotation
around the span-wise axis. A partitioned approach based on two separate solvers
and a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) coupling scheme is applied. The
in-house CFD solver FASTEST-3D computes the fluid sub-problem according to the
wall-resolved large-eddy simulation (LES) combined with the Smagorinsky model
(1963). The structural sub-problem is solved by a rigid movement solver
implemented by Viets (2013), which is based on the equations of motion for
rigid bodies. The FSI coupling exchanges information between both solvers based
on loose or strong coupling algorithms. A thorough analysis of the problem is
primarily performed in order to acquire a computational setup that provides the
best compromise between accuracy and CPU-time requirements. Three system
configurations are then tested and thoroughly investigated: One leads to an
oscillatory behavior of the airfoil characterized by limited small amplitudes.
The other is characterized by the presence of the torsional divergence
aeroelastic instability. Finally, a configuration aimed at the flutter
phenomenon is established. However, not enough data are currently available and
therefore this dynamic aeroelastic instability can not be thoroughly
investigated in the present work. In the near future, this study will serve as
a base for the flutter experiments and computations performed at the Department
of Fluid Mechanics located of the Helmut-Schmidt-University.

microcanonical quantum field theory and Hamilton's principle to classical
evolution equations. These are based on the well-known correspondence under a
Wick rotation between quantum field theories and 4-D statistical mechanical
theories. By placing quantum field theories on a 4+1-D under Wick rotation to
5-D, expectations of observables are calculated for a microcanonical field
theory averaging Hamiltonian flow over a fifth spacelike dimension, a technique
common in lattice gauge simulations but not in perturbation theory. In a novel
demonstration, averaging pairs of external lines in the classical Feynman
diagrams over the fifth dimension generates diagrams with loops and vacuum
fluctuations identical to Standard Model diagrams. Because it is
microcanonical, this approach, while equivalent for standard quantum fields
theories in the Standard Model, is able to quantize theories that have no
canonical quantization. It is also unique in representing expectations as
averages over solutions to an ordinary, classical PDE rather than a path
integral or operator based approaches. Hence, this approach draws a clear
connection between quantum field theory and classical field theory in higher
dimensions which has implications towards how quantum effects are interpreted.
In particular, it raises questions about how violations of the ergodic
hypothesis could influence quantum measurements even in standard,
non-statistical quantum field theory.

paramount importance. In this paper, we put forward a simulation tool based on
the most up-to-date configurations of the various subsystems (e.g. filters,

uncertainties in the instrumental response. Notably, the effect of
uncertainties in the energy resolution and of the instrumental quantum

measurements of the iron K complex in the hot gas surrounding clusters of

powerful probe of the ionisation state of the intervening intergalactic medium,
potentially allowing us to set strong constraints on the epoch of reionisation
(EoR). Here we quantify the presence of Ly$\alpha$ damping wing absorption from
the EoR in the spectrum of ULASJ1342+0928. Our Bayesian framework
simultaneously accounts for uncertainties on: (i) the intrinsic QSO emission
(obtained from reconstructing the Ly$\alpha$ profile from a covariance matrix
of emission lines) and (ii) the distribution of HII regions during reionisation
(obtained from three different 1.6$^3$ Gpc$^3$ simulations spanning the range
of plausible EoR morphologies). Our analysis is complementary to that in the
discovery paper (Ba\~nados et al.) and the accompanying method paper (Davies et
al.) as it focuses solely on the damping wing imprint redward of Ly$\alpha$
($1218 < \lambda < 1230$\AA), and uses a different methodology for (i) and
(ii). We recover weak evidence for damping wing absorption. Our intermediate
EoR model yields a volume-weighted neutral hydrogen fraction at $z=7.5$ of
$\bar{x}_{\rm HI} = 0.21\substack{+0.17 \\ -0.19}$ (68 per cent). The
constraints depend weakly on the EoR morphology. Our limits are lower than
those presented previously, though they are consistent at ~1-1.5$\sigma$. We
attribute this difference to: (i) a lower amplitude intrinsic Ly$\alpha$
profile obtained from our reconstruction pipeline, driven by correlations with
other high-ionisation lines in the spectrum which are relatively weak; and (ii)
only considering transmission redward of Ly$\alpha$ when computing the
likelihood, which reduces the available constraining power but makes the
results less model-dependent. Our results are consistent with previous
estimates of the EoR history, and support the picture of a moderately extended
EoR.

statistical and systematic effects on the X-IFU energy scale, occurring either
during ground measurements or in-flight. The corresponding impacts on the

systematic effects on the gain due to realistic changes in TES operating

problems in astronomy. Various solutions have been proposed in the past such as
the parametric approaches based on the least-squares fit of theoretical
templates or the non-parametric techniques as the phase-folding method. Most of
them, however, are suited only for signals with specific time evolution. For
generic signals the spectral approach based on the periodogram is potentially
the most effective. In astronomy the main problem in working with the
periodogram is that often the sampling of the signals is irregular. This
complicates its efficient computation (the fast Fourier transform cannot be
directly used) but overall the determination of its statistical
characteristics. The Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP) provides a solution to this
last important issue, but its main drawback is the assumption of a very
specific model of the datawhich is not correct for most of the practical
applications. These issues are not always considered in literature with
theoretical and practical consequences of no easy solution. Moreover, apart
from pathological samplings, it is common believe that the LSP and the
classical periodogram (CP) usually provide almost identical results. In
general, this is true but here it is shown that there are situations where the
LSP is less effective than the CP in the detection of signals in noise. There
are no compelling reasons, therefore, to use the LSP instead of the CP which is
directly connected to the correlation function of the observed signal with the
sinusoidal functions at the various frequencies of interest.

-O, -F and -OH functional groups as a result of the chemical etching production
process. These functional groups are known to be randomly distributed over the
surfaces, with limited experimental control over their composition. There is
considerable debate regarding the contribution of these functional groups to
the properties of the underlying MXene material. For instance, their measured
Li or Na capacity is far lower than that predicted by theoretical simulations,
which generally assume uniformly terminated surfaces. The extent to which this
structural simplification contributes to such discrepancies is unknown. We
address this issue by employing first-principles calculations to compare the
structural, electronic and electrochemical properties of two common MXenes,
namely Ti3C2Tx and V2CTx, with both uniform terminating groups and explicitly
mixed terminations. Weighted averages of uniformly-terminated layer properties
are found to give excellent approximations to those of more realistic,
randomly-terminated structures. The sodium storage capacity and volume change
during sodiation in the interlayer space of these MXenes with mixed surface
terminations are also investigated. The redox reaction is shown to be confined
to the terminating groups for low concentrations of intercalated Na, with the
oxidation state of the metal atoms unaffected until higher concentrations of
intercalated Na are achieved. Finally, the average open circuit voltage is
shown to be very similar for both Ti3C2T2Na and V2CT2Na with mixed
terminations, although it is highly sensitive to the particular composition of

covers the underlying random variable space more evenly than i.i.d. draws,

conditional symmetries for higher-order systems of partial differential

symmetries from known conditional symmetries, and unnecessary previous
assumptions of the theory are removed. As a consequence, new insights into
other types of conditional symmetries arise. We then apply the so-called PDE
Lie systems to the derivation and analysis of Lie algebras of conditional
symmetries. In particular, we develop a method for obtaining solutions of a
higher-order system of PDEs via the solutions and geometric properties of a PDE
Lie system, whose form gives a Lie algebra of conditional symmetries of the
Clairin type. Our methods are illustrated with physically relevant examples
such as nonlinear wave equations, the Gauss--Codazzi equations for minimal
soliton surfaces, and generalised Liouville equations.

neutron diffraction experiments suggest that the collinear antiferromagnetism
persists in the whole doping range, where the N\'{e}el temperature $T_N$
coincides with the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition temperature
$T_s$, and both of them keeps around 35 K. The magnetic ordered moment, on the

reveals that the Cr substitutions actually stretch the FeAs$_4$ tetrahedron

regime of a Pd-doped FeRh epilayer that appears as the first-order
ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic phase transition takes place. It is seen that
the measured value of the exchange stiffness is suppressed throughout the
measurement range when compared to the expected value of the fully
ferromagnetic regime, extracted via the independent means of a measurement of
the Curie point, for only slight changes in the ferromagnetic volume fraction.
This behavior is attributed to the influence of the antiferromagnetic phase:
inspired by previous experiments that show ferromagnetism to be most persistent
at the surfaces and interfaces of FeRh thin films, we modelled the
antiferromagnetic phase as forming a thin layer in the middle of the epilayer
through which the two ferromagnetic layers are coupled up to a certain critical
thickness. The development of this exchange stiffness is then consistent with
that expected from the development of an exchange coupling across the magnetic
phase boundary, as a consequence of a thickness dependent phase transition
taking place in the antiferromagnetic regions and is supported by complimentary
computer simulations of atomistic spin-dynamics. The development of the Gilbert
damping parameter extracted from the ferromagnetic resonance investigations is
consistent with this picture.

the cumulative contribution of many weaker regions cannot be ignored. In order
to recreate the axial dipole moment to a reasonable degree, many more regions

We suggest that the negative contribution of the most significant regions of

minimum and the low-amplitude Cycle 24. We also examine the relationship
between a region's axial dipole moment contribution and its emergence latitude,

moment of a given region has been measured, we can predict the long-term dipole

cost-efficient way to achieve ITS by detecting vehicles using Vehicle to
Infrastructure (V2I) communications. Traditional ITS algorithms, in most cases,
assume that every vehicle is observed, such as by a camera or a loop detector,
but a V2I implementation would detect only those vehicles with wireless
communications capability. We examine a family of transportation systems, which
we will refer to as `Partially Detected Intelligent Transportation Systems'. An
algorithm that can act well under a small detection rate is highly desirable
due to gradual penetration rates of the underlying wireless technologies such
as Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) technology. Artificial

for finding such an algorithm due to utilizing varied inputs and not requiring
explicit analytic understanding or modeling of the underlying system dynamics.
In this paper, we report a RL algorithm for partially observable ITS based on
DSRC. The performance of this system is studied under different car flows,
detection rates, and topologies of the road network. Our system is able to
efficiently reduce the average waiting time of vehicles at an intersection,

conformal point for the non-relativistic electromagnetic-gravity interaction.
In distinction, the corresponding kinetic conformal value for pure
Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity in $3+1$ dimensions is $\lambda=1/3$. We analyze
the geometrical structure of the critical and noncritical cases, they
correspond to different theories. The physical degrees of freedom propagated by
the noncritical theory are the transverse traceless graviton, the transverse
gauge vector and two scalar fields. In the critical theory one of the scalars
is absent, only the dilaton scalar field is present. The gravity and vector
excitations propagate with the same speed, which at low energy can be taken to
be the speed of light. The field equations for the gauge vector in the
non-relativistic theory have exactly the same form as the relativistic
electromagnetic field equations arising from the Kaluza-Klein reduction of
General Relativity, and are equal to them for a particular value of one of the
coupling constants. The potential in the Hamiltonian is a polynomial of finite
degree in the gauge vector and its covariant derivatives.

this paper we develop asymptotic approximations in the near-contact limit for
the entire set of surface-plasmon modes associated with the prototypical sphere
dimer geometry. Starting from the quasi-static plasmonic eigenvalue problem, we
employ the method of matched asymptotic expansions between a gap region, where
the boundaries are approximately paraboloidal, pole regions within the spheres
and close to the gap, and a particle-scale region where the spheres appear to
touch at leading order. For those modes that are strongly localised to the gap,
relating the gap and pole regions gives a set of effective eigenvalue problems
formulated over a half space representing one of the poles. We solve these
problems using integral transforms, finding asymptotic approximations, singular
in the dimensionless gap width, for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. In the
special case of modes that are both axisymmetric and odd about the plane
bisecting the gap, where matching with the outer region introduces a
logarithmic dependence upon the dimensionless gap width, our analysis follows

analyse the so-called anomalous family of even modes, characterised by field

Therefore, collisions among multiple networks need to be considered for
choosing the appropriate protocol parameters. With growing numbers of networks,
simulations for estimating the collision rate become computationally very
complex and lengthy. The large simulation times therefore constitute a major
limitation in the analysis of complex cases. In this paper, we present a novel
simulation technique which can speed up collision simulations by one order of
magnitude in realistic situations. Whenever the transmission of a packet is
simulated, the cyclic nature of protocols like BLE is exploited to predict the
next packet that has a chance of colliding. All transmissions in between can be
skipped without affecting the simulation results. Based on the transmission
intervals of the networks, one can compute a certain shrinkage per cycle of the
time offset between their packets. Using this shrinkage and the current offset
between the starting times of any two packets, our proposed simulation model
can accurately predict the next pair of packets that needs to be simulated.
Whereas our proposed technique aims at the BLE protocol, the theory is generic

recovers and improves prior analyses, yields lower bounds and derives new
instances of privacy amplification by subsampling. Our method leverages a
characterization of differential privacy as a divergence which emerged in the
program verification community. Furthermore, it introduces new tools, including
advanced joint convexity and privacy profiles, which might be of independent

complex systems, well-defined measures are essential. In the
susceptible-infected model on heterogeneous networks, the cluster of infected
nodes in the intermediate-time regime exhibits too large fluctuation in size to
use its mean size as a representative value. The cluster size follows quite a
broad distribution, which is shown to be derived from the variation of the
cluster size with the time when a hub node was first infected. On the contrary,
the distribution of the time taken to infect a given number of nodes is well
concentrated at its mean, suggesting the mean infection time is a better
measure. We show that the mean infection time can be evaluated by using the
scaling behaviors of the boundary area of the infected cluster and use it to
find a non-exponential but algebraic spreading phase in the intermediate stage
on strongly heterogeneous networks. Such slow spreading originates in only
small-degree nodes left susceptible, while most hub nodes are already infected
in the early exponential-spreading stage. Our results offer a way to detour
around large statistical fluctuations and quantify reliably the temporal
pattern of spread under structural heterogeneity.

to make up the gap from VaR estimation to ES estimation because there exists a
bijective mapping from expectiles to specific quantile, and ES can be induced
by expectile through a simple formula. Then, we introduce the empirical
likelihood method to determine the relation above; this method is data-driven
and distribution-free. Theoretical studies guarantee the asymptotic properties,
such as consistency and the asymptotic normal distribution of the estimator
obtained by our proposed method. A Monte Carlo experiment and an empirical

sample size of the training data is often small and/or a label imbalance
problem occurs, where a few samples belong to a single class and the majority
of samples belong to the other classes. This can lead to uncertainty related to
the learned parameters of the machine learning model. To address this

computed efficiently using the dropout technique. We demonstrate that BayesGrad
successfully visualizes the substructures responsible for the label prediction

outperforms the wrong one. More importantly, a new method that can obtain any
univariate or multivariate DOS distribution is demonstrated, which is expected
to be helpful for the study of the wireless communications and networking.

between two propulsion modes in free space. The model is based on a point-like
particle emitting periodically cylindrical standing waves. Submitted to a force
related to the local wavefield gradient, the particle is propelled, while the
wave field stores positional information on the particle trajectory. For long
memory, the linear motion is unstable and we observe erratic switches between
two propulsive modes : linear motion and diffusive motion. We show that the
bimodal propulsion and the stochastic aspect of the dynamics at long time are
generated by a Shil'nikov chaos. The memory of the system controls the fraction
of time spent in each phase. The resulting bimodal dynamics shows analogies
with intermittent search strategies usually observed in living systems of much
higher complexity.

attacks on wireless communications and a defense strategy is presented. A
cognitive transmitter uses a pre-trained classifier to predict the current
channel status based on recent sensing results and decides whether to transmit
or not, whereas a jammer collects channel status and ACKs to build a deep
learning classifier that reliably predicts the next successful transmissions
and effectively jams them. This jamming approach is shown to reduce the
transmitter's performance much more severely compared with random or
sensing-based jamming. The deep learning classification scores are used by the
jammer for power control subject to an average power constraint. Next, a
generative adversarial network (GAN) is developed for the jammer to reduce the
time to collect the training dataset by augmenting it with synthetic samples.
As a defense scheme, the transmitter deliberately takes a small number of wrong
actions in spectrum access (in form of a causative attack against the jammer)
and therefore prevents the jammer from building a reliable classifier. The
transmitter systematically selects when to take wrong actions and adapts the
level of defense to mislead the jammer into making prediction errors and
consequently increase its throughput.

Legendre differential equation, with input coefficient $A$ and initial
conditions $X_0$ and $X_1$. In a previous study [Calbo G. et al, Comput. Math.
Appl., 61(9), 2782--2792 (2011)], a mean square convergent power series
solution on $(-1/e,1/e)$ was constructed, under the assumptions of mean fourth
integrability of $X_0$ and $X_1$, independence, and at most exponential growth
of the absolute moments of $A$. In this paper, we relax these conditions to
construct an $\mathrm{L}^p$ solution ($1\leq p\leq\infty$) to the random
Legendre differential equation on the whole domain $(-1,1)$, as in its
deterministic counterpart. Our hypotheses assume no independence and less
integrability of $X_0$ and $X_1$. Moreover, the growth condition on the moments
of $A$ is characterized by the boundedness of $A$, which simplifies the proofs
significantly. We also provide approximations of the expectation and variance
of the response process. The numerical experiments show the wide applicability
of our findings. A comparison with Monte Carlo simulations and gPC expansions
is performed.

require the construction of explicit maps in the form of point clouds or
voxels. The goal is to learn an implicit representation of the environment at a
higher, more abstract level. We propose to use a generative approach based on
Generative Query Networks (GQNs, Eslami et al. 2018), asking the following
questions: 1) Can GQN capture more complex scenes than those it was originally
demonstrated on? 2) Can GQN be used for localization in those scenes? To study
this approach we consider procedurally generated Minecraft worlds, for which we
can generate images of complex 3D scenes along with camera pose coordinates. We
first show that GQNs, enhanced with a novel attention mechanism can capture the
structure of 3D scenes in Minecraft, as evidenced by their samples. We then
apply the models to the localization problem, comparing the results to a
discriminative baseline, and comparing the ways each approach captures the task
uncertainty.

applications. However, such a data-driven approach is often criticized for lack
of interpretability. Recently, we proposed artificial quadratic neural networks
consisting of second-order neurons in potentially many layers. In each
second-order neuron, a quadratic function is used in the place of the inner
product in a traditional neuron, and then undergoes a nonlinear activation.
With a single second-order neuron, any fuzzy logic operation, such as XOR, can
be implemented. In this sense, any deep network constructed with quadratic
neurons can be interpreted as a deep fuzzy logic system. Since traditional
neural networks and second-order counterparts can represent each other and
fuzzy logic operations are naturally implemented in second-order neural
networks, it is plausible to explain how a deep neural network works with a
second-order network as the system model. In this paper, we generalize and
categorize fuzzy logic operations implementable with individual second-order
neurons, and then perform statistical/information theoretic analyses of
exemplary quadratic neural networks.

this makes text categorization becomes a challenging issue. The most
significant problem of text categorization is its huge number of features. Most
of these features are redundant, noisy and irrelevant that cause over fitting
with most of the classifiers. Hence, feature extraction is an important step to
improve the overall accuracy and the performance of the text classifiers. In
this paper, we will provide an overview of using principle component analysis
(PCA) as a feature extraction with various classifiers. It was observed that
the performance rate of the classifiers after using PCA to reduce the dimension
of data improved. Experiments are conducted on three UCI data sets, Classic03,
CNAE-9 and DBWorld e-mails. We compare the classification performance results
of using PCA with popular and well-known text classifiers. Results show that
using PCA encouragingly enhances classification performance on most of the
classifiers.
