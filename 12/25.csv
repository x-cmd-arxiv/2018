symmetric MOG black holes, which are a type of black holes encountered in
scalar-tensor-vector modified gravitational theories. After determining the
scattering modes in this black hole geometry, we apply the partial wave method
to compute analytical expressions for the phase shifts that enter into the
definition of scattering amplitudes. An analysis of the influence of the MOG
parameter $\alpha$ on the differential scattering cross section and the induced
polarization is conducted. Also, a comparison with Schwarzschild scattering
(for which $\alpha = 0$) is performed. Furthermore, it is also shown that glory
and spiral/orbiting scattering are more significant for higher values of the
free parameter $\alpha$.

triumphed over semantic segmentation, which is one of the core tasks in many
applications such as autonomous driving and augmented reality. However, to
train CNNs requires a considerable amount of data, which is difficult to
collect and laborious to annotate. Recent advances in computer graphics make it
possible to train CNNs on photo-realistic synthetic imagery with
computer-generated annotations. Despite this, the domain mismatch between the
real images and the synthetic data hinders the models' performance. Hence, we
propose a curriculum-style learning approach to minimizing the domain gap in
urban scene semantic segmentation. The curriculum domain adaptation solves easy
tasks first to infer necessary properties about the target domain; in
particular, the first task is to learn global label distributions over images
and local distributions over landmark superpixels. These are easy to estimate
because images of urban scenes have strong idiosyncrasies (e.g., the size and
spatial relations of buildings, streets, cars, etc.). We then train a
segmentation network, while regularizing its predictions in the target domain
to follow those inferred properties. In experiments, our method outperforms the
baselines on two datasets and two backbone networks. We also report extensive
ablation studies about our approach.

  Control Method","11 pages, 8 figures; Edited References, Edited Title",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Delayed feedback control is an easy realizable control method which generates
control force by comparing the current and the delayed version of the system
states. In this paper, a new form of the delayed feedback structure is
introduced. Based on the proposed delayed feedback method, a new robust
tracking system is designed. This tracking system improves the features of the
conventional state feedback with integral action and it is also able to reject
higher order disturbances compared to the conventional method. In addition, the
proposed tracking system tracks the ramp-shape reference input signal as well,
which this is not possible through the conventional state feedback. Due to easy
implementable feature of the proposed delayed feedback tracking system, it can
be used in practical applications effectively. Moreover, since the proposed
method adds delays to the closed loop system dynamics, the ordinary
differential equation of the system changes to a delay differential equation
with an infinite number of characteristic roots. Thus, conventional pole
placement procedures cannot be used to design the delayed feedback controller
parameters and place the unstable roots in the left half plane. In this paper,
the simulated annealing algorithm is used to determine the proposed control
system parameters and move the unstable roots of the delay differential
equation to the left half plane. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed
reference input tracker is demonstrated on a case study.

be impossible due to strong absorption. A few very recent works reported
terahertz generation from water, but the mechanism is not clear and the

single-cycle terahertz radiation with field strength of $\rm 0.2~MV cm^{-1}$ is
generated from a water line/column of $\sim 200 \mu m$ in diameter irradiated
by a mJ femtosecond laser beam. This strength is 100-fold higher than that
produced from air. We attribute the mechanism to the
laser-ponderomotive-force-induced current with the symmetry broken around the
water-column interface. This mechanism can explain our following observations:
the radiation can be generated only when the laser propagation axis deviates
from the column center; the deviation determines its field strength and
polarity; it is always p-polarized no matter whether the laser is p- or
s-polarized. This study provides a simple and efficient scheme of table-top
terahertz sources based on liquid water.

era of multimessenger astronomy. This historic detection has been instrumental
in providing constraints on the tidal polarizability of neutron stars. In turn,
the tidal polarizability has been used to impose limits on stellar radii and
ultimately on the equation of state (EOS). The tidal polarizability is also
sensitive to the second tidal Love number k2. It is the main purpose of this
work to perform a detailed study of k2 which, for a given compactness
parameter, encodes the entire sensitivity of the tidal polarizability to the
EOS. In particular, we examine the role that the crustal component of the EOS
plays in the determination of k2. A set of realistic models of the equation of
state that yield an accurate description of the properties of finite nuclei and
support neutron stars of two solar masses is used. Given that the tidal
polarizability scales as the fifth power of the compactness parameter, a
universal relation exists among the tidal polarizability and the compactness
parameter that is highly insensitive to the underlying EOS. Thus, besides an
extraction of the tidal polarizabilities, a measurement of the individual
stellar masses is also required to impact the mass-radius relation. However, we
observe a strong sensitivity of k2 to the EOS, particularly to the contribution
from the inner crust. Although by itself the tidal polarizability can not
contribute to the determination of the mass-radius relation, future detections
of binary neutron star mergers are poised to provide significant constraints on
both the tidal polarizabilities and masses of the individual stars, and thus
ultimately on the mass-radius relation. Yet, subleading corrections to the
tidal polarizability are encoded in the second Love number k2 which displays a
large sensitivity to the entire (crust-plus-core) EOS.

arrangement. For the maser at the northwestern end (maser A), we fit three
Gaussian components. In the strongest component, we obtain a significant Zeeman
detection, with $zB_{\rm los}=-23.4\pm3.2$ Hz. If we use $z=-0.920$ Hz
mG$^{-1}$ for the $F=5 \rightarrow 4$ hyperfine transition, this corresponds to
a magnetic field $|B_{\rm los}|=25.4$ mG; $B_{\rm los}$ would be higher if a
different hyperfine was responsible for the 44 GHz maser, but our results also
rule out some hyperfines, since fields in these regions cannot be hundreds of
mG. Class I methanol masers form in outflows where shocks compress magnetic
fields in proportion to gas density. Designating our detected $B_{\rm los}=25$
mG as the magnetic field in the post-shock gas, we find that $B_{\rm los}$ in
the pre-shock gas should be 0.1-0.8 mG. Although there are no thermal-line
Zeeman detections toward DR21W, such values are in good agreement with Zeeman
measurements in the CN thermal line of 0.36 and 0.71 mG about $3.5'$ away in
DR21(OH) in gas of comparable density to the pre-shock gas density in DR21W.
Comparison of our derived magnetic energy density to the kinetic energy density

a set of constraints (antecedents) implies another constraint (consequent), and

use information theory to define the degree of satisfaction, and prove several

can be reduced to 1. Second, we prove that there exists an implication between
CIs that does not admit any relaxation; however, we prove that every
implication between CIs relaxes ""in the limit"". Then, we show that the
implication problem for differential constraints in market basket analysis also
admits a relaxation with a factor equal to 1. Finally, we show how some of the
results in the paper can be derived using the I-measure theory, which relates
between information theoretic measures and set theory. Our results recover, and
sometimes extend, previously known results about the implication problem: the
implication of MVDs and FDs can be checked by considering only 2-tuple
relations.

assimilate the tissue and extra cellular matrix as a porous medium, using
Darcy's law for describing both blood and intersticial fluid flows. Oxygen
obeys a convection-diffusion-reaction equation describing advection by the
blood, diffusion and consumption by the tissue. Discrete agents named capillary
elements and modelling groups of endothelial cells are created or deleted
according to different rules involving the oxygen concentration gradient, the
blood velocity, the sheer stress or the capillary element density. Once
created, a capillary element locally enhances the hydraulic conductivity
matrix, contributing to a local increase of the blood velocity and oxygen flow.
No connectivity between the capillary elements is imposed. The coupling between
blood, oxygen flow and capillary elements provides a positive feedback
mechanism which triggers the emergence of a network of channels of high
hydraulic conductivity which we identify as new blood capillaries. We provide
two different, biologically relevant geometrical settings and numerically
analyze the influence of each of the capillary creation mechanism in detail.
All mechanisms seem to concur towards a harmonious network but the most
important ones are those involving oxygen gradient and sheer stress. A detailed
discussion of this model with respect to the literature and its potential
future developments concludes the paper.

with a minimal modification, the expression describes also the spatial
structures of localized resonances in strictly $1$D random systems. It is thus
suggested that the underlying physics of eigenchannels might include

related to the resonances. Our findings open up a way to tailor the spatial

fan rotational speed were obtained. These experimental data along with typical
characteristics of turbulent boundary layers were used to predict the noise of
the axial fan. Hot-wire wake measurements were made in the near region
downstream of the fan plane. The fan noise was measured upstream of the fan.
The experimentally obtained self-noise was then compared to the predictions
made by the semi-empirical acoustic model. Goody's and Rozenberg's models for
surface pressure spectra were used in the semi-empirical acoustic model.
Rozenberg's model offered a more accurate prediction in the final fan noise

wake. Different operating conditions and blade configurations were examined.
For a given dimensionless operating condition, the self-noise was obtained for
different rotational speeds, and the effect of the fan speed on the propagated

trained in an overparameterized regime where the parameters of the model exceed
the size of the training dataset. Due to this overparameterization, the
training loss may have infinitely many global minima and it is critical to
understand the properties of the solutions found by first-order optimization
schemes such as (stochastic) gradient descent starting from different
initializations. In this paper we demonstrate that when the loss has certain
properties over a minimally small neighborhood of the initial point, first
order methods such as (stochastic) gradient descent have a few intriguing
properties: (1) the iterates converge at a geometric rate to a global optima
even when the loss is nonconvex, (2) among all global optima of the loss the
iterates converge to one with a near minimal distance to the initial point, (3)
the iterates take a near direct route from the initial point to this global
optima. As part of our proof technique, we introduce a new potential function
which captures the precise tradeoff between the loss function and the distance
to the initial point as the iterations progress. For Stochastic Gradient
Descent (SGD), we develop novel martingale techniques that guarantee SGD never

very restricted timing constraints are allowed. On the positive side, we show
that model checking HyperMTL with quantifier alternations is possible under
certain conditions in the synchronous semantics, or when there is a fixed bound

We present a dynamic programming based algorithm for path balancing technology

conduction electrons peak occurs in the spectral function of intermediate QD in

forming from between the two peripheral QDs and leads, enhances with decreasing
temperature and increasing dot-lead coupling. Both the spin-spin correlations
between the two adjacent QDs and the two peripheral QDs owns negative values.
It also confirms the physical picuture of the overlapping between left and

decreasing temperature and increasing dot-lead coupling. This investigation
will be beneficial to detect the Kondo clouds and to further explore Kondo

any variables including the stress and the particle displacements, even though
the glass interior is elastically inhomogeneous. In particular, the shear
modulus can be expressed in terms of the correlations between the interior

long-lived correlations among the fluctuations of the forces from the walls and
the displacements of all the particles in the cell. We confirm these

represented. To deal with incomplete data, Incomplete Multi-view Learning (IML)
rises. In this paper, we propose the Joint Embedding Learning and Low-Rank
Approximation (JELLA) framework for IML. The JELLA framework approximates the
incomplete data by a set of low-rank matrices and learns a full and common
embedding by linear transformation. Several existing IML methods can be unified
as special cases of the framework. More interestingly, some linear
transformation based complete multi-view methods can be adapted to IML directly
with the guidance of the framework. Thus, the JELLA framework improves the
efficiency of processing incomplete multi-view data, and bridges the gap
between complete multi-view learning and IML. Moreover, the JELLA framework can
provide guidance for developing new algorithms. For illustration, within the
framework, we propose the Incomplete Multi-view Learning with Block Diagonal
Representation (IML-BDR) method. Assuming that the sampled examples have
approximate linear subspace structure, IML-BDR uses the block diagonal
structure prior to learn the full embedding, which would lead to more correct
clustering. A convergent alternating iterative algorithm with the Successive
Over-Relaxation optimization technique is devised for optimization.
Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of

more false discoveries. In particular, we characterize the false discovery
control behavior of rate optimal and rate suboptimal estimators under different

objective of maximizing system energy efficiency in a multi-cell massive MIMO
system. The proposed precoding design jointly considers the issues of power
control, interference management, antenna switching and user throughput in a
cluster of base stations (BS). We demonstrate that the precoding design can be
formulated into a general sparsity-inducing non-convex problem, which is
NP-hard. We thus apply a smooth approximation of zero-norm in the antenna power
management to enable the application of the gradient-based algorithms. The
non-convexity of the problem may also cause slow convergence or even divergence
if some classical gradient algorithms are directly applied. We thus develop an
efficient alternative algorithm combining features from augmented multiplier
(AM) and quadratic programming (QP) to guarantee the convergence. We
theoretically prove the convergence conditions for our algorithm both locally
and globally under realistic assumptions. Our proposed algorithms further
facilitate a distributed implementation that reduces backhaul overhead by
offloading data-intensive steps to local computation at each BS. Numerical
results confirm that our methods indeed achieve higher energy efficiency with
superior convergence rate, compared to some well-known existing methods.

treatment effect (CSTE) curve modeled as an unknown function of a weighted
linear combination of all baseline covariates. The weight or the coefficient
for each covariate is estimated by fitting a sparse semi-parametric logistic
single-index coefficient model. The CSTE curve is estimated by a
spline-backfitted kernel procedure, which enables us to further construct a
simultaneous confidence band (SCB) for the CSTE curve under a desired
confidence level. Based on the SCB, we find the subgroups of patients that
benefit from each treatment, so that we can make individualized treatment
selection. The innovations of the proposed method are three-fold. First, the
proposed method can quantify variability associated with the estimated optimal
individualized treatment rule with high-dimensional covariates. Second, the
proposed method is very flexible to depict both local and global associations
between the treatment and baseline covariates in the presence of
high-dimensional covariates, and thus it enjoys flexibility while achieving
dimensionality reduction. Third, the SCB achieves the nominal confidence level
asymptotically, and it provides a uniform inferential tool in making
individualized treatment decisions.

task in a fashion e-commerce recommender system. It will significantly enhance

the rich yet complicated set of compatibility patterns in a large e-commerce
corpus of fashion items, this task is still underexplored. Inspired by the
recent advances in multi-relational knowledge representation learning and deep
neural networks, this paper proposes a novel Translation-based Neural Fashion
Compatibility Modeling (TransNFCM) framework, which jointly optimizes fashion
item embeddings and category-specific complementary relations in a unified
space via an end-to-end learning manner. TransNFCM places items in a unified
embedding space where a category-specific relation (category-comp-category) is
modeled as a vector translation operating on the embeddings of compatible items
from the corresponding categories. By this way, we not only capture the
specific notion of compatibility conditioned on a specific pair of
complementary categories, but also preserve the global notion of compatibility.
We also design a deep fashion item encoder which exploits the complementary
characteristic of visual and textual features to represent the fashion
products. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses
category-specific complementary relations to model the category-aware
compatibility between items in a translation-based embedding space. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TransNFCM over the

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), but it is insufficient to contribute the
performance improvement. In this paper, we focus on the attention map for
visual explanation, which represents high response value as the important
region in image recognition. This region significantly improves the performance
of CNN by introducing an attention mechanism that focuses on a specific region
in an image. In this work, we propose Attention Branch Network (ABN), which
extends the top-down visual explanation model by introducing a branch structure
with an attention mechanism. ABN can be applicable to several image recognition
tasks by introducing a branch for attention mechanism and is trainable for the
visual explanation and image recognition in end-to-end manner. We evaluate ABN
on several image recognition tasks such as image classification, fine-grained
recognition, and multiple facial attributes recognition. Experimental results
show that ABN can outperform the accuracy of baseline models on these image
recognition tasks while generating an attention map for visual explanation. Our

applications. A practical and critical problem thus has emerged: how to
effectively deploy the deep neural network models such that they can be
executed efficiently. Conventional cloud-based approaches usually run the deep
models in data center servers, causing large latency because a significant
amount of data has to be transferred from the edge of network to the data
center. In this paper, we propose JALAD, a joint accuracy- and latency-aware
execution framework, which decouples a deep neural network so that a part of it
will run at edge devices and the other part inside the conventional cloud,
while only a minimum amount of data has to be transferred between them. Though
the idea seems straightforward, we are facing challenges including i) how to
find the best partition of a deep structure; ii) how to deploy the component at
an edge device that only has limited computation power; and iii) how to
minimize the overall execution latency. Our answers to these questions are a
set of strategies in JALAD, including 1) A normalization based in-layer data
compression strategy by jointly considering compression rate and model
accuracy; 2) A latency-aware deep decoupling strategy to minimize the overall
execution latency; and 3) An edge-cloud structure adaptation strategy that
dynamically changes the decoupling for different network conditions.
Experiments demonstrate that our solution can significantly reduce the
execution latency: it speeds up the overall inference execution with a
guaranteed model accuracy loss.

noise between 1 kHz and 50 kHz, and obtain a more sensitive measurement of the
microresonator's position. To confirm that the back action is eliminated, we
measure the noise in the transmission signal as a function of circulating

correlating the two signals, we remove the contributon from shot noise and
measure a quantum noise free thermal noise spectrum. Eliminating the effects of

technique that could be used to mitigate the effects of back action in
interferometric gravitational wave detectors such as Advanced LIGO.

simultaneously reduces the global magnetic dipole moment through magnetic
burial and generates a mass quadrupole moment, which emits gravitational
radiation. Previous mountain models have been calculated for idealized
isothermal and adiabatic equations of state. Here these models are generalised
to include non-zero, finite thermal conduction. Grad-Shafranov equilibria for
three representative, polytropic equations of state are evolved over many
conduction time-scales with the magnetohydrodynamic solver PLUTO. It is shown
that conduction facilitates the flow of matter towards the pole. Consequently
the buried magnetic field is partially resurrected starting from an initially
polytropic Grad-Shafranov equilibrium. The poleward mass current makes the star
more prolate, marginally increasing its detectability as a gravitational wave
source, though to an extent which is likely to be subordinate to other mountain
physics. Thermal currents also generate filamentary hot spots $(\gtrsim 10^{8}
\text{ K})$ in the mountain, especially near the pole where the heat flux is
largest, with implications for type I X-ray bursts.

(MRI) is a crucial prerequisite for NPC radiotherapy. However, manually
segmenting of NPC is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Additionally,
single-modality MRI generally cannot provide enough information for its
accurate delineation. Therefore, a multi-modality MRI fusion network (MMFNet)
based on three modalities of MRI (T1, T2 and contrast-enhanced T1) is proposed
to complete accurate segmentation of NPC. The backbone of MMFNet is designed as
a multi-encoder-based network, consisting of several encoders to capture
modality-specific features and one single decoder to fuse them and obtain
high-level features for NPC segmentation. A fusion block is presented to
effectively fuse features from multi-modality MRI. It firstly recalibrates
low-level features captured from modality-specific encoders to highlight both
informative features and regions of interest, then fuses weighted features by a
residual fusion block to keep balance between fused ones and high-level
features from decoder. Moreover, a training strategy named self-transfer, which
utilizes pre-trained modality-specific encoders to initialize
multi-encoder-based network, is proposed to make full mining of information
from different modalities of MRI. The proposed method based on multi-modality
MRI can effectively segment NPC and its advantages are validated by extensive
experiments.

machine interpretable meaning representations which can be executed against a
real-world environment such as a database. Scaling semantic parsing to
arbitrary domains faces two interrelated challenges: obtaining broad coverage
training data effectively and cheaply; and developing a model that generalizes
to compositional utterances and complex intentions. We address these challenges
with a framework which allows to elicit training data from a domain ontology
and bootstrap a neural parser which recursively builds derivations of logical
forms. In our framework meaning representations are described by sequences of
natural language templates, where each template corresponds to a decomposed
fragment of the underlying meaning representation. Although artificial,
templates can be understood and paraphrased by humans to create natural
utterances, resulting in parallel triples of utterances, meaning
representations, and their decompositions. These allow us to train a neural
semantic parser which learns to compose rules in deriving meaning
representations. We crowdsource training data on six domains, covering both
single-turn utterances which exhibit rich compositionality, and sequential
utterances where a complex task is procedurally performed in steps. We then
develop neural semantic parsers which perform such compositional tasks. In
general, our approach allows to deploy neural semantic parsers quickly and
cheaply from a given domain ontology.

which consumption stays constant. Consumption increases or decreases at the
thresholds and after the adjustment new thresholds are set. The share of risky
investment in the agent's total investment is inversely U-shaped within the (s,
S) band, which generates time-varying risk aversion that can fluctuate widely
over time. This property can explain puzzles and questions on asset pricing and
households' portfolio choices, e.g., why aggregate consumption is so smooth
whereas the high equity premium is high and the equity return has high
volatility, why the risky share is so low whereas the estimated risk aversion
by the micro-level data is small, and whether and when an increase in wealth
has an impact on the risky share. Also, the partial irreversibility model can
explain both the excess sensitivity and the excess smoothness of consumption.

massive overloaded multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems where the
number of transmit antennas $n$ is larger than that of receive antennas $m$.
Since the proposed algorithm is based on the projected gradient descent method
with trainable parameters, it is named the trainable projected
gradient-detector (TPG-detector). The trainable internal parameters, such as
the step-size parameter, can be optimized with standard deep learning
techniques, i.e., the back propagation and stochastic gradient descent
algorithms. This approach is referred to as data-driven tuning, and ensures
fast convergence during parameter estimation in the proposed scheme. The
TPG-detector mainly consists of matrix-vector product operations whose
computational cost is proportional to $m n$ for each iteration. In addition,
the number of trainable parameters in the TPG-detector is independent of the
number of antennas. These features of the TPG-detector result in a fast and
stable training process and reasonable scalability for large systems. Numerical
simulations show that the proposed detector achieves a comparable detection
performance to those of existing algorithms for massive overloaded MIMO
channels, e.g., the state-of-the-art IW-SOAV detector, with a lower computation
cost.

length-scale but do not link it to an underlying formalism describing geometric
superpositions. Here, we introduce an intuitive approach in which points in the
classical spatial background are delocalised, or `smeared', giving rise to an
entangled superposition of geometries. The model uses additional degrees of
freedom to parameterise the superposed classical backgrounds. Our formalism
contains both minimum length and minimum momentum resolutions and we naturally
identify the former with the Planck length. In addition, we argue that the
minimum momentum is determined by the de Sitter scale, and may be identified
with the effects of dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant. Within
the new formalism, we obtain both the generalised uncertainty principle (GUP)
and extended uncertainty principle (EUP), which may be combined to give an
uncertainty relation that is symmetric in position and momentum. Crucially, our
approach does not imply a significant modification of the position-momentum
commutator, which remains proportional to the identity matrix. It therefore
yields generalised uncertainty relations without violating the equivalence
principle, in contradistinction to existing models based on nonlinear
dispersion relations. Implications for cosmology and the black hole uncertainty
principle correspondence are briefly discussed, and prospects for future work
on the smeared-space model are outlined.

wavelength ($\lambda$) and polarization in a deuterium cluster using molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation. For a given laser energy and a pulse duration
$\approx$ 5-fs (fwhm), it is found that maximum laser absorption does not
happen at the welknown static Mie-resonance or linear resonance (LR) wavelength
of $\lambdaM\approx 263$~nm (for deuterium cluster) irrespective of linear
polarization (LP) and circular polarization (CP) state of laser. As the laser
intensity increases, the absorption peak is gradually red-shifted to a higher
$\lambda$ in the marginally over-dense regime of $\lambda\!\! \approx
\!\!(1\!\!-\!\!1.5)\lambdaM$ from the expected static~$\lambdaM$ owing to
gradual outer ionization and cluster expansion; and above an intensity the
resonance absorption peak disappears (sometimes followed by {\em even} a growth
of absorption) when outer ionization saturates at 100\% for both LP and CP.
This disappearance of the resonance absorption peak should not be
misinterpreted as the negligible (or no) role of Mie-resonance. In fact, in
this marginally over-dense band of $\lambda\!\! \approx
\!\!(1\!\!-\!\!1.5)\lambdaM$, some electrons undergo dynamic Mie-resonance
(dynamic LR) and others anharmonic resonance when they are freed. It is also
found that before the absorption peak, laser absorption due to LP and CP lasers
are almost equally efficient (CP case being inappreciably higher than LP) for
all intensities and $\lambda$. However, after the absorption peak, at lower
intensities, absorption due to LP inappreciably dominates absorption due to CP
with increasing~$\lambda$ which gradually reverses at higher intensities. MD
results are also supported by a naive rigid sphere model of cluster.

need prior knowledge on number of clusters, which is not always available; (3)
there is a demand for faster computational speed. Results: We propose to tackle
these challenges with Parallel Split Merge Sampling on Dirichlet Process
Mixture Model (the Para-DPMM model). Unlike classic DPMM methods that perform
sampling on each single data point, the split merge mechanism samples on the
cluster level, which significantly improves convergence and optimality of the
result. The model is highly parallelized and can utilize the computing power of
high performance computing (HPC) clusters, enabling massive clustering on huge

  Application to Brain Connectivity","Accepted for publication in Journal of Neuroscience Methods",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Recent studies have indicated that functional connectivity is
dynamic even during rest. A common approach to modeling the dynamic functional
connectivity in whole-brain resting-state fMRI is to compute the correlation
between anatomical regions via sliding time windows. However, the direct use of
the sample correlation matrices is not reliable due to the image acquisition
and processing noises in resting-sate fMRI.
  New method: To overcome these limitations, we propose a new statistical model
that smooths out the noise by exploiting the geometric structure of correlation
matrices. The dynamic correlation matrix is modeled as a linear combination of
symmetric positive-definite matrices combined with cosine series
representation. The resulting smoothed dynamic correlation matrices are
clustered into disjoint brain connectivity states using the k-means clustering
algorithm.
  Results: The proposed model preserves the geometric structure of underlying
physiological dynamic correlation, eliminates unwanted noise in connectivity
and obtains more accurate state spaces. The difference in the estimated dynamic
connectivity states between males and females is identified.
  Comparison with existing methods: We demonstrate that the proposed
statistical model has less rapid state changes caused by noise and improves the
accuracy in identifying and discriminating different states.
  Conclusions: We propose a new regression model on dynamically changing
correlation matrices that provides better performance over existing windowed
correlation and is more reliable for the modeling of dynamic connectivity.

phenomena. In this paper, the glitch sizes and inter-glitch time intervals were
statistically analysed in a sample of 168 pulsars with a total of 483 glitches.
The glitches were broadly divided into two groups. Those with $ \Delta\nu/\nu <
10^{-7} $ are regarded as small size glitches, while those with $ \Delta\nu/\nu
\geq 10^{-7} $ are regarded as relatively large size glitches. In the ensemble
of glitches, the distribution of $ \Delta\nu/\nu $ is seen to be bimodal as
usual. The distribution of inter-glitch time intervals is unimodal and the
inter-glitch time intervals between small and large size glitches are not
significantly different from each other. This observation shows that
inter-glitch time intervals are size independent. In addition, the distribution
of the ratio $ \Delta\nu/\nu:t_{i} $ in both small and large size glitches has
the same pattern. This observation suggests that a parameter which depends on
time, which could be the spin-down rate of a pulsar plays a similar role in the
processes that regulate both small and large size glitches. Equally this could
be an indication that a single physical mechanism, which could produce varying
glitch sizes at similar time-intervals could be responsible for both classes of
glitch sizes.

Coupled mode theory is employed in order to study more complex structures. The
similarity between the coupled mode equations and the effective non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians governing open quantum systems allows us to translate a series of
collective phenomenon emerging in condensed matter and nuclear physics to the
system of plasmonic spheres. A nontrivial physics emerges as a result of strong
non-radiative near field coupling between adjacent spheres. For a system of two
identical spheres, this occurs when the width of the plasmonic resonance of the
uncoupled spheres is twice the imaginary component of the coupling constant.
The two spheres then become coupled through a single continuum channel and the
effect of coherent interaction between the spheres becomes noticeable. The
eigenmodes of the system fall into two distinct categories: superradiant states
with enhanced radiation and dark states with no radiation. The transmission
through one-dimensional chains with an arbitrary number of spheres is also
considered within the effective Hamiltonian framework which allows us to
calculate observables such as the scattering and transmission amplitudes. This
nano-scale waveguide can undergo an additional superradiance phase transition

and turbulent fluxes of potential temperature for waves and fluid flow. The
waves emitted at a certain level, propagate upward, and the losses of wave
energy cause the production of turbulence energy. We demonstrate that due to
the nonlinear effects more intensive waves produce more strong turbulence, and
this, in turns, results in strong damping of IGW. As a result, the penetration
length of more intensive waves is shorter than that of less intensive IGW. The
anisotropy of the turbulence produced by less intensive IGW is stronger than
that caused by more intensive waves. The low amplitude IGW produce turbulence
consisting up to 90 \% of turbulent potential energy. This resembles the
properties of the observed high altitude tropospheric strongly anisotropic
(nearly two-dimensional) turbulence.

real-world consequences. While previous work in defending against these
adversarial examples has investigated using audio preprocessing to reduce or
distort adversarial noise, this work explores the idea of flooding particular
frequency bands of an audio signal with random noise in order to detect
adversarial examples. This technique of flooding, which does not require
retraining or modifying the model, is inspired by work done in computer vision
and builds on the idea that speech classifiers are relatively robust to natural
noise. A combined defense incorporating 5 different frequency bands for
flooding the signal with noise outperformed other existing defenses in the
audio space, detecting adversarial examples with 91.8% precision and 93.5%

Gpc^-3 yr^-1. Only some extreme evolutionary models can generate NS-NS merger
rates in old host galaxies consistent with the LIGO/Virgo estimate. However, we
show that these models generate rates exceeding empirical Galactic NS-NS merger

current evolutionary models produce NS-NS merger rates that are consistent with
the Milky Way empirical rates. However, these models generate local cosmic
NS-NS merger rate in old host galaxies that are below the LIGO/Virgo estimate.
The reason behind this tension is the predicted delay time distribution between
star formation and NS-NS mergers that favors short delays. Evolutionary models
produce a generic steep power-law NS-NS delay time distribution. This limits
NS-NS merger rates in old host galaxies. However, we show that such
distribution is consistent with observations of Galactic NS-NS binaries; 50% of
which show very long merger times (much longer than Hubble time). Once model
distributions are convolved with continuous prolonged (10 Gyr) star formation
in the Galactic disk, then 20-70% (depending on a model) of the predicted NS-NS
population has very long current Galactic merger times. Although NS-NS binaries
are formed predominantly with short delay times, many of short delay time
systems merge and do not make it to the present, while long delay time systems

via a set of coupled transport equations including the effects of collisional
energy loss, transverse momentum broadening and medium-induced splitting. The
dynamics of the jet energy and momentum deposited into the medium is described
by hydrodynamic equations with source terms. Our detailed analysis indicates
that collisional absorption (energy loss) tends to narrow the jet shape
function while transverse momentum kicks and medium-induced radiations broaden
the jet transverse profile. Also, jet-induced flow plays a significant
contribution to jet shape function and dominates at large angles away from the
jet axis. The final nuclear modification pattern for the jet shape function is
a combined effect from various jet-medium interaction mechanisms. Our detailed
studies for single inclusive jets and $\gamma$-jets for various kinematics
indicate that the nuclear modification of jet shape has strong dependence on

to the standard quantum limit and the Heisenberg limit, respectively. Notably,
these error bounds can be reached by either position-localized states or

radiations such as the galactic synchrotron radiation, galactic free-free

the design of 21cm experiments and analysis of their data, simulation is an
essential tool, and good sky foreground model is needed. With existing data the
whole sky maps are available only in low angular resolutions or for limited

both diffuse foreground and point sources. Our diffuse map is constructed by
generating physical foreground components including the galactic synchrotron
emission and galactic free-free emission. The point source sample is generated
using the actual data from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) and the Sydney
University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS) where they are available and complete in
flux limit, and mock point sources according to statistical distributions. The
entire model is made self-consistent by removing the integrated flux of the
point sources from the diffuse map so that this part of radiation is not double
counted. We show that with the point sources added, a significant angular power
is introduced in the mock sky map, which may be important for foreground
subtraction simulations. Our sky maps and point source catalogues are available

novel type of data that contains both the differences and features about

Adversarial Feature Separability (AFS), where the difference between the
feature maps of the original images and adversarial examples becomes larger
with deeper layers. On top of that, we further develop an adversarial example
recognition framework that detects adversarial examples and can recover the
correct labels. In the experiments, the detection and classification of
adversarial examples by AFGs has an accuracy of more than 90.01\% in various
attack scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first method
that focuses on both attack detecting and recovering. AFG gives a new

the network functionality during its entire life span (during the node removal
event) is considered. This approach considers nodes removal due to aging - a
state where nodes can be degenerated and become nonfunctional, when their
survival time duration - their lifetime - is passed. Accordingly, a problem
that has to be solved is: in the network design stage, how to divide a budget
of lifetime between the network's nodes, such that the network functionality
during all the stages of nodes removal due to aging, is maximized. To date, the
problem has been solved only partially and numerically. In this paper we solve
the problem analytically, and derive a criterion for choosing the right set of
nodes on which the total lifetime budget should be divided. We also find
analytically the best way of dividing the lifetime budget between the chosen

$\omega_0$ determines the quadratic steepness of the confining potential and
$\omega_c$ is a cyclotron frequency. This makes the sum
${S_\rho}_{nm}+{S_\gamma}_{nm}$ a field-independent quantity that increases
with the principal $n$ and azimuthal $m$ quantum numbers and does satisfy
entropic uncertainty relation. Position Fisher information does not depend on
$m$, linearly increases with $n$ and varies as $\omega_{eff}$ whereas its $n$

in the effective mass of the phase direction observed in the Higgs inflation
still appear in the mixed Higgs-$R^2$ model. While the spikes appear above the
cut-off scale in the Higgs-only case, they appear below the cut-off scale when
the model is extended with $R^2$ term though reheating cannot be completed in
the violent particle production regime since the spikes get milder.

fundamental issue in the field of relativistic laser-plasma interactions. In
this paper, we present an analysis framework for description of these
evolutions during propagation of a short intense laser pulse in a sub-critical
high-density plasma (the pulse length exceeds the plasma wavelength). In this
context, the pulse evolutions are attributed to the wakefield induced
self-modulation and destabilization via parametric exponentiation of the
initial noise content. The self-consistent plasma evolutions are formulated in
terms of quantities which used to be motion constants in the absence of pulse
evolutions. This proves very useful both in understanding plasma evolutions
during self-modulation and also in facilitating the instability studies in the
strongly nonlinear regime, via refinement of unstable plasma perturbations.
General analytical solutions, at arbitrary pulse conditions, are derived for
self-modulation, indicating that the envelop evolutions are driven by the
induced spatial frequency-chirp. Also, these results state that the envelope
attains fine modulations which produce long wavelength low-frequency modes via
beating the carrier mode. The plasma wave variations are found to convect and
amplify away from the pulse front. Regarding parametric instability, we assess
different scattering regimes at different pulse shapes and peak intensities,
manifesting anomalous behaviors ranging from wild positioning of the Stokes
wave in dispersion plane to broadening in the scattered spectrum and halting
the instability. Our analyses are assisted and verified by numerous fluid and
particle-in-cell simulations. Based on our results, we discuss phenomena like
the pulse breakup and its different regimes, and assisted particle acceleration
in presence of pulse evolutions.

that characterizes their external appearances. Understanding differences
between shapes and modeling the variability within and across shape classes,
hereinafter referred to as \emph{shape analysis}, are fundamental problems to
many applications, ranging from computer vision and computer graphics to
biology and medicine. This chapter provides an overview of some of the recent
techniques that studied the shape of 3D objects that undergo non-rigid
deformations including bending and stretching. Recent surveys that covered some
aspects such classification, retrieval, recognition, and rigid or nonrigid
registration, focused on methods that use shape descriptors. Descriptors,
however, provide abstract representations that do not enable the exploration of
shape variability. In this chapter, we focus on recent techniques that treated
the shape of 3D objects as points in some high dimensional space where paths
describe deformations. Equipping the space with a suitable metric enables the
quantification of the range of deformations of a given shape, which in turn
enables (1) comparing and classifying 3D objects based on their shape, (2)
computing smooth deformations, i.e. geodesics, between pairs of objects, and
(3) modeling and exploring continuous shape variability in a collection of 3D
models. This article surveys and classifies recent developments in this field,
outlines fundamental issues, discusses their potential applications in computer
vision and graphics, and highlights opportunities for future research. Our
primary goal is to bridge the gap between various techniques that have been

becomes more and more urgent. Given the fact that the training data may contain
highly sensitive information, e.g., personal medical records, directly sharing
them among the users (i.e., participants) or centrally storing them in one
single location may pose a considerable threat to user privacy.
  In this paper, we present a practical privacy-preserving collaborative deep
learning system that allows users to cooperatively build a collective deep
learning model with data of all participants, without direct data sharing and
central data storage. In our system, each participant trains a local model with
their own data and only shares model parameters with the others. To further
avoid potential privacy leakage from sharing model parameters, we use
functional mechanism to perturb the objective function of the neural network in
the training process to achieve $\epsilon$-differential privacy. In particular,
for the first time, we consider the existence of~\textit{unreliable

solution to reduce the impact of these participants while protecting their
privacy. We evaluate the performance of our system on two well-known real-world

the proposed system is robust against unreliable participants, and achieves
high accuracy close to the model trained in a traditional centralized manner

principle lies at the heart of current attosecond technologies. However, full
access to strong-field photoemission regimes at near-infrared wavelengths based
on solid-state materials is restricted by space-charge screening and material
damage at high optical-field strengths, which significantly hampers the
realization of predicted attosecond technologies, such as ultra-sensitive
optical phase modulation. Here, we demonstrate a new type of strong-field
photoemission behaviour with extreme nonlinearity -- photoemission current
scales follow a 40th power law of the optical-field strength, making use of
sub-nanometric carbon nanotubes and 800 nm pulses. As a result, the total
photoemission current depends on the carrier-envelope phase with a greatly
improved photoemission current modulation depth of up to 100%, which has not
previously been achieved. Time-dependent density functional calculations reveal
the completely new behaviour of the optical-field induced tunnelling emission
process directly from the valence band of the carbon nanotubes, which is an
indication of full access to a strong-field photoemission regime. Furthermore,
the nonlinear dynamics are observed to be tunable by changing the binding
energy of the valence-band-maximum, as confirmed by Simpleman model
calculations. We believe that such extreme nonlinear photoemission from
nanotips offers a new means of producing extreme temporal-spatial resolved
electron pulses. These results additionally provide a new design philosophy for
attosecond electronics and optics by making use of tunable band structures in
nanomaterials.

$\Delta_{2h}(x)$. The same two-gap state with close electron and inner hole
gaps $\Delta_{2h}(x) \approx \Delta_e (x, \phi)$ is also preserved in the phase
of coexisting antiferromagnetism and superconductivity. The doping dependence
of the electron gap $\Delta_e (x, \phi)$ is associated with the strong doping
dependence of the spin-fluctuation interaction in the AFM transition region. In
contrast to the electron gap $\Delta_e (x, \phi)$, the doping dependence of the
hole gaps $\Delta_{1,2h}(x)$ and the critical temperature $T_{c}(x)$, both
before and after the AFM transition, are associated with a change of the
density of states $\gamma_{nh}(x)$ and the intraband electron-phonon
interaction in the hole bands. The non-phonon spin-fluctuation interaction in
the hole bands in the entire Co concentration range is small compared with the
intraband electron-phonon interaction and is not dominant in the
$Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_{x})_{2}As_{2}$ family.

when their numbers are below a threshold and exclude them otherwise. We study
how the two switching strategies influence the evolutionary dynamics in the

a stable coexistence of cooperators, defectors and players adopting the
switching strategy in a well-mixed population, and this regardless of whether
the pool-based or the peer-based switching strategy is introduced. Moreover, we
show that the pure exclusion strategy alone is able to evoke a limit cycle

theory and statistical physics, and its close connections to cluster learning,

Although it has been studied in numerous contexts, the existing literatures

paper, motivated by a classical deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) evolution model,
the F$81$ model, and taking into consideration of the Chargaff's parity rule by
allowing the existence of a guanine-cytosine content bias, we study the noise
channel in terms of a $4\times 4$-state asymmetric probability transition

information reconstruction problem in molecular phylogenetics is explored, by
means of refined analyses of moment recursion, in-depth concentration
estimates, and thorough investigations on an asymptotic $4$-dimensional
nonlinear second order dynamical system. We rigorously show that the
reconstruction bound is not tight when the sum of the base frequencies of
adenine and thymine falls in the interval $\left(0,1/2-\sqrt{3}/6\right)\bigcup
\left(1/2+\sqrt{3}/6,1\right)$, which is the first rigorous result on

based IR models do not make full use of the hierarchical features from the
original low-quality images, thereby achieving relatively-low performance. In
this paper, we propose a novel residual dense network (RDN) to address this
problem in IR. We fully exploit the hierarchical features from all the
convolutional layers. Specifically, we propose residual dense block (RDB) to
extract abundant local features via densely connected convolutional layers. RDB
further allows direct connections from the state of preceding RDB to all the
layers of current RDB, leading to a contiguous memory mechanism. To adaptively
learn more effective features from preceding and current local features and
stabilize the training of wider network, we proposed local feature fusion in
RDB. After fully obtaining dense local features, we use global feature fusion
to jointly and adaptively learn global hierarchical features in a holistic way.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of RDN with several representative IR
applications, single image super-resolution, Gaussian image denoising, image
compression artifact reduction, and image deblurring. Experiments on benchmark
and real-world datasets show that our RDN achieves favorable performance
against state-of-the-art methods for each IR task quantitatively and visually.

significantly reduced, and power of the Shewhart charts may be undesirably low,

delay in detection of inferior products (Phase II procedure). For more

agents. The process that the nanorobots detect tumors by swimming in the
high-risk tissue region can be regarded as the process that the agents search
for the solutions of an objective function in the parameter space with some
constraints. For multimodal optimization (MMO) aiming to locate multiple
optimal solutions in a single simulation run, niche technology has been widely
used. Specifically, the Niche Genetic Algorithm (NGA) has been shown to be
particularly effective in solving MMO. It can be used to identify the global
optima of multiple hump functions in a running, keep effectively the diversity
of the population, and avoid premature of the genetic algorithm. Learning from
the optimization procedure of NGA, we propose the NGA-inspired MCDP in order to
locate the tumor targets efficiently while taking into account realistic in
vivo propagation and controlling of nanorobots, which is different from the use
scenario of the standard NGA. To improve the performance of the MCDP, we also
modify the crossover operator of the original NGA from crossing within a
population to crossing between two populations. Finally, we present
comprehensive numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
NGA-inspired MCDP when the biological objective function is associated with the
blood flow velocity profile caused by tumor-induced angiogenesis.

learning community. The state-of-the-art deep neural network models used in
recommender systems are typically multilayer perceptron and deep Autoencoder
(DAE), among which DAE usually shows better performance due to its superior
capability to reconstruct the inputs. However, we found existing DAE
recommendation systems that have similar implementations on similar datasets
result in vastly different parameter settings. In this work, we have built a
flexible DAE model, named FlexEncoder that uses configurable parameters and
unique features to analyse the parameter influences on the prediction accuracy
of recommender systems. This will help us identify the best-performance
parameters given a dataset. Extensive evaluation on the MovieLens datasets are
conducted, which drives our conclusions on the influences of DAE parameters.
Specifically, we find that DAE parameters strongly affect the prediction
accuracy of the recommender systems, and the effect is transferable to similar
datasets in a larger size. We open our code to public which could benefit both
new users for DAE -- they can quickly understand how DAE works for
recommendation systems, and experienced DAE users -- it easier for them to tune
the parameters on different datasets.

  Sensitization",,,,,"physics.med-ph q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objective:We propose a novel iterative-optimizationinspired direct targeting
strategy (DTS) for smart nanosystems, which harness swarms of externally
manipulable nanoswimmers assembled by magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) for
knowledgeaided tumor sensitization and targeting. We aim to demonstrate through
computational experiments that the proposed DTS can significantly enhance the
accumulation of MNPs in the tumor site, which serve as a contrast agent in
various medical imaging modalities, by using the shortest possible
physiological routes and with minimal systemic exposure. Methods: The epicenter
of a tumor corresponds to the global maximum of an externally measurable
objective function associated with an in vivo tumor-triggered biophysical
gradient; the domain of the objective function is the tissue region at a high
risk of malignancy; swarms of externally controllable magnetic nanoswimmers for
tumor sensitization are modeled as the guess inputs. The objective function may
be resulted from a passive phenomenon such as reduced blood flow or increased
kurtosis of microvasculature due to tumor angiogenesis; otherwise, the
objective function may involve an active phenomenon such as the fibrin formed
during the coagulation cascade activated by tumortargeted ""activator""
nanoparticles. Subsequently, the DTS can be interpreted from the iterative
optimization perspective: guess inputs (i.e., swarms of nanoswimmers) are
continuously updated according to the gradient of the objective function in
order to find the optimum (i.e., tumor) by moving through the domain (i.e.,
tissue under screening). Along this line of thought, we propose the
computational model based on the gradient descent (GD) iterative method to
describe the GD-inspired DTS, which takes into account the realistic in vivo
propagation scenario of nanoswimmers.

the dynamics of an electron driven by a focused relativisticaly intense optical
envelope, is established on the basis of a rigorous asymptotic expansion of the
Newton and Maxwell equations in a small parameter proportional to the ratio of
radiation wavelength to beam waist. The pertinent ground-state and first order
solutions are generated as functions of the electron proper time with the help
of the Krylov-Bogolyubov technique, the equations for the phase-averaged
components of the ground state arising from the condition that the first-order
solutions sustain non-secular behaviour. In the case of the scattering of a
sparse electron ensemble by a relativistically intense laser pulse with an
axially symmetric transverse distribution of amplitude, the resulting
ponderomotive model further affords averaging over the random initial
directions of the electron momenta and predicts axially symmetric electron
scatter. Diagrams of the electron scatter directionality relative to the
optical field propagation axis and energy spectra within selected angles are
calculated from the compact ponderomotive model. The hot part of the scatter
obeys a clear energy-angle dependence stemming from the adiabatic invariance
inherent in the model, with smaller energies allocated to greater angular
deviations from the field propagation axis, while the noise-level cold part of
the scatter tends to spread almost uniformly over a wide range of angles. The
allowed energy diapasons within specific angular ranges are only partially
covered by the actual high-energy electron scatter.

experiences no self force. In this case, the particle radiates without
dissipating its kinetic and potential energy. But what happens when the
particle enters another region with equal and opposite acceleration? Does the
oscillating charge lose its mechanical energy similar to a radiating dipole,
even though it seems to lose no mechanical energy within each region of
constant acceleration? In this paper, I will show how mechanical energy is
transferred to radiation energy via the Schott energy when the particle crosses
the boundary between the two regions. In particular, I will show how
preacceleration, which is usually regarded as an unphysical effect of the
Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac self force, is essential for the energy transfer.
Moreover, I will show that the commonly adopted Landau-Lifshitz approximation,
which removes preacceleration, introduces second-order secular energy error. On
a more fundamental level, the validity of classical electrodynamics is in fact
questionable because quantum effects are likely important. The classical
prediction can be tested experimentally by observing frequency chirping of
radiation, whereby micro physics leaves signatures on macroscopic scales. The
required experimental accuracy is estimated. Trap experiment of this type is
complementary to collider experiments that endeavor to observe radiation
reaction for elementary particles.
