throughput and optimize memory access patterns, we apply them to causal set
quantum gravity, in which spacetime is represented by a partially ordered set.
We build upon the low-level set and graph algorithms to optimize the
calculation of the causal set action, and then discuss how to measure
boundaries of a discrete spacetime. We then examine the broader applicability
of these algorithms to greedy information routing in random geometric graphs
embedded in Lorentzian manifolds, which requires us to find new closed-form
solutions to the geodesic differential equations in
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker spacetimes. Finally, we consider the vacuum

yields a dynamical mechanism for vacuum selection in the context of multiverse
cosmology. These algorithms have broad applicability to many physical systems,
and they improve existing methods by reducing simulation runtimes by orders of

Motivated by this exciting experimental advance, we conducted density
functional theory (DFT) and classical molecular dynamics simulations to study
the mechanical, thermal conductivity and stability, electronic and optical
properties of single-layer B-graphdiyne. We particularly analyzed the
application of this novel 2D material as an anode for Li, Na, Mg and Ca ions

its porous structure and flexibility can yield superstretchability. The
single-layer B-graphdiyne was found to exhibit semiconducting electronic
character, with a narrow band-gap of 1.15 eV based on the HSE06 prediction. It
was confirmed that the mechanical straining can be employed to further tune the
optical absorbance and electronic band-gap of B-graphdiyne. Ab initio molecular
dynamics results reveal that B-graphdiyne can withstand at high temperatures,
like 2500 K. The thermal conductivity of suspended single-layer B-graphdiyne
was predicted to be very low, ~2.5 W/mK at the room temperature. Our
first-principles results reveal the outstanding prospect of B-graphdiyne as an

science topics are underrepresented in school curricula hence teaching time for
these topics is limited. From primary through secondary school, only a few
opportunities exist for young students to explore programming. Furthermore,
today's teachers are rarely trained in computer science, which impairs their
potential to motivate students in these courses. Within the ""No One Left
Behind"" (NOLB) project, teachers were supported to guide and assist their
students in their learning processes by constructing ideas through game making.
Thus, students created games that referred to different subject areas by using
the programming tool Pocket Code, an app developed at Graz University of
Technology (TU-Graz). This tool helps students to take control of their own
education, becoming more engaged, interested, and empowered as a result. To
ensure an optimal integration of the app in diverse subjects the different
backgrounds (technical and non-technical) of teachers must be considered as
well. First, teachers were supported to use Pocket Code in the different
subjects in school within the feasibility study of the project. Observed
challenges and difficulties using the app have been gathered. Second, we
conducted interviews with teachers and students to underpin our onsite
observations. As a result, it was possible to validate Pocket Codes' potential
to be used in a diverse range of subjects. Third, we focused especially on
those teachers who were not technically trained to provide them with a
framework for Pocket Code units, e.g., with the help of structured lesson plans

technique that allows developers to easily check that their code can build
successfully and pass tests across various system environments. In order to use
a CI platform, a developer must include a set of configuration files to a code
repository for specifying build conditions. Incorrect configuration settings
lead to CI build failures, which can take hours to run, wasting valuable
developer time and delaying product release dates. Debugging CI configurations
is challenging because users must manage configurations for the build across
many system environments, to which they may not have local access. Thus, the
only way to check a CI configuration is to push a commit and wait for the build
result. To address this problem, we present the first approach, VeriCI, for
statically checking for errors in a given CI configuration before the developer
pushes a commit to build on the CI server. Our key insight is that the
repositories in a CI environment contain lists of build histories which offer
the time-aware repository build status. Driven by this insight, we introduce
the Misclassification Guided Abstraction Refinement (MiGAR) loop that automates
part of the learning process across the heterogeneous build environments in CI.
We then use decision tree learning to generate constraints on the CI
configuration that must hold for a build to succeed by training on a large
history of continuous integration repository build results. We evaluate VeriCI
on real-world data from GitHub and find that we have 83% accuracy of predicting
a build failure.

the phenomenon and determining the leading contribution is peremptory for

demonstrate the dominance of the intrinsic mechanism of the spin Hall effect in
highly-resistive Ta. We obtain an intrinsic spin Hall conductivity for
$\beta$-Ta of -820$\pm$120 ($\hbar$/e) $\Omega^{-1}cm^{-1}$ from spin
absorption experiments in a large set of lateral spin valve devices. The
predominance of the intrinsic mechanism in Ta allows us to linearly enhance the

We show that such unusual interference patterns, which are fundamentally
different from the acoustic displacement fields, stem from the nonlocal

corroborated by numerical simulations taking into account the sign reversal of

The observing frequency has been chosen to provide a signal that is dominated
by Galactic synchrotron emission, but suffers little from Faraday rotation, so
that the measured polarization directions provide a good template for higher
frequency observations, and carry direct information about the Galactic
magnetic field. Telescopes in both northern and southern hemispheres with
matched optical performance are used to provide all-sky coverage from a
ground-based experiment. A continuous-comparison radiometer and a correlation
polarimeter on each telescope provide stable imaging properties such that all
angular scales from the instrument resolution of 45 arcmin up to full sky are
accurately measured. The northern instrument has completed its survey and the
southern instrument has started observing. We expect that C-BASS data will
significantly improve the component separation analysis of Planck and other CMB

Galactic dust and the Galactic magnetic field.

achieving quantum advantages over classical computation requires extremely low

However, recent theoretical work has shown that the accuracy of computation
based off expectation values of quantum observables can be enhanced through an
extrapolation of results from a collection of varying noisy experiments. Here,
we demonstrate this error mitigation protocol on a superconducting quantum
processor, enhancing its computational capability, with no additional hardware
modifications. We apply the protocol to mitigate errors on canonical single-

optimization of Hamiltonians for quantum chemistry and magnetism. We
effectively demonstrate that the suppression of incoherent errors helps unearth
otherwise inaccessible accuracies to the variational solutions using our noisy
processor. These results demonstrate that error mitigation techniques will be
critical to significantly enhance the capabilities of near-term quantum

address this problem we propose a supervised machine learning based method able
to predict which public \threads will generate private messages, after a
partial leak of such messages has occurred. To the best of our knowledge, we
are the first to develop a solution to overcome the barrier posed by limited to
no information on private activity for underground forum analysis.
Additionally, we propose an automate method for labeling posts, significantly
reducing the cost of our approach in the presence of real unlabeled data. This
method can be tuned to focus on the likelihood of users receiving private

performance of our methods using data from three real forum leaks. Our results
show that public information can indeed be used to predict private activity,
although prediction models do not transfer well between forums. We also find
that neither the length of the leak period nor the time between the leak and
the prediction have significant impact on our technique's performance, and that
NLP features dominate the prediction power.

is the availability of comprehensive datasets covering diverse camera

datasets is challenging. We propose to complete existing databases by
generating new database entries. The key idea is to synthesize data in the
skeleton space (instead of doing so in the depth-map space) which enables an
easy and intuitive way of manipulating data entries. Since the skeleton entries
generated in this way do not have the corresponding depth map entries, we
exploit them by training a separate hand pose generator (HPG) which synthesizes
the depth map from the skeleton entries. By training the HPG and HPE in a
single unified optimization framework enforcing that 1) the HPE agrees with the
paired depth and skeleton entries; and 2) the HPG-HPE combination satisfies the
cyclic consistency (both the input and the output of HPG-HPE are skeletons)
observed via the newly generated unpaired skeletons, our algorithm constructs a
HPE which is robust to variations that go beyond the coverage of the existing
database. Our training algorithm adopts the generative adversarial networks
(GAN) training process. As a by-product, we obtain a hand pose discriminator
(HPD) that is capable of picking out realistic hand poses. Our algorithm
exploits this capability to refine the initial skeleton estimates in testing,
further improving the accuracy. We test our algorithm on four challenging
benchmark datasets (ICVL, MSRA, NYU and Big Hand 2.2M datasets) and demonstrate

dusty and gaseous disks similar to the ones around young stellar objects.
Whereas significant effort is spent on modeling observations of disks around
young stellar objects, the disks around post-AGB binaries receive significantly
less attention, even though they pose significant constraints on theories of
disk physics and binary evolution. Aims: We want to examine the structure of
and phenomena at play in circumbinary disks around post-AGB stars. We continue
the analysis of our near-infrared interferometric image of the inner rim of the
circumbinary disk around IRAS08544-4431. We want to understand the physics
governing this inner disk rim. Methods: We use a radiative transfer model of a
dusty disk to reproduce simultaneously the photometry as well as the
near-infrared interferometric dataset on IRAS08544-4431. The model assumes
hydrostatic equilibrium and takes dust settling self-consistently into account.
Results: The best-fit radiative transfer model shows excellent agreement with
the spectral energy distribution up to mm wavelengths as well as with the
PIONIER visibility data. It requires a rounded inner rim structure, starting at
a radius of 8.25 au. However, the model does not fully reproduce the detected
over-resolved flux nor the azimuthal flux distribution of the inner rim. While
the asymmetric inner disk rim structure is likely to be the consequence of
disk-binary interactions, the origin of the additional over-resolved flux
remains unclear. Conclusions: As in young stellar objects, the disk inner rim
of IRAS08544-4431 is ruled by dust sublimation physics. Additional observations
are needed to understand the origin of the extended flux and the azimuthal
perturbation at the inner rim of the disk.

constrain, for the stellar halo of the Milky Way, scenarios for its formation
and evolution. We have measured the anisotropy $\beta$ as a function of
Galactocentric radius from $5-100$ kpc for over 8600 metal poor ([Fe/H]
$<-1.3$) halo K giants from the LAMOST catalog with line-of-sight velocities
and distances, matched to proper motions from the second $Gaia$ data release.
We construct full 6-D positions and velocities for the K giants to directly
measure the 3 components of the velocity dispersion $(\sigma_r, \sigma_\theta,
\sigma_\phi)$ (in spherical coordinates). We find that the orbits in the halo
are radial over our full Galactocentric distance range reaching over 100 kpc.
The anisotropy remains remarkably unchanged with Galactocentric radius from
approximately 5 to 25 kpc, with an amplitude that depends on the metallicity of
the stars, dropping from $\beta \approx 0.9$ for $-1.8 \leq$ [Fe/H] $< -1.3$
(for the bulk of the stars) to $\beta \approx 0.6$ for the lowest metallicities
([Fe/H] $< -1.8$). Considering our sample as a whole, $\beta\approx0.8$ and,
beyond 25 kpc, the orbits gradually become less radial and anisotropy decreases
to $\beta<0.3$ past 100 kpc. Within 8 kpc, $\beta<0.8$. The measurement of
anisotropy is affected by substructure and streams, particularly beyond a
Galactocentric distance of approximately 25 kpc, where the Sagittarius stream
is prominent in the data. These results are complimentary to recent analysis of

with the so-called Sine-Gordon equation and is built to preserve the Liouville
measure which has been constructed recently on the two-dimensional sphere $S^2$
and the torus $T^2$ in the work by David-Kupiainen-Rhodes-Vargas. The SPDE we
shall focus on has the following (simplified) form: \[ p_t X = \frac 1 {4\pi}
\Delta X - e^{\gamma X} + \xi\,, \] where $\xi$ is a space-time white noise on
$R_+ \times S^2$ or $R_+ \times T^2$. The main aspect which distinguishes this
singular stochastic SPDE with well-known SPDEs studied recently (KPZ, dynamical
$\Phi^4_3$, dynamical Sine-Gordon, etc.) is the presence of intermittency. One
way of picturing this effect is that a naive rescaling argument suggests the
above SPDE is sub-critical for all $\gamma>0$, while we don't expect solutions
to exist when $\gamma > 2$. In this work, we initiate the study of this
intermittent SPDE by analyzing what one might call the ""classical"" or ""Da
Prato-Debussche"" phase which corresponds here to
$\gamma\in[0,\gamma_{dPD}=2\sqrt{2} -\sqrt{6})$. By exploiting the positivity
of the non-linearity $e^{\gamma X}$, we can push this classical threshold
further and obtain this way a weaker notion of solution when
$\gamma\in[\gamma_{dPD}, \gamma_{pos}=2\sqrt{2} - 2)$. Our proof requires an
analysis of the Besov regularity of natural space/time Gaussian multiplicative
chaos (GMC) measures. Regularity Structures of arbitrary high degree should
potentially give strong solutions all the way to the same threshold
$\gamma_{pos}$ and should not push this threshold further. Of independent
interest, we prove along the way (using techniques from [HS16]) a stronger
convergence result for approximate GMC measures which holds in Besov spaces.

implemented using a second-order semi-implicit integrator and validated using
several dust-hydrodynamical test problems. Each dust particle has a grain size
distribution, describing the local abundance of grains of different sizes. The
grain size distribution is discretised with a second-order piecewise linear

simulate an isolated disc galaxy to study the impact of dust physical processes

example, how dust shattering shifts the grain size distribution to smaller
sizes resulting in a significant rise of radiation extinction from optical to
near-ultraviolet wavelengths. Our framework for simulating dust and gas
mixtures can readily be extended to account for other dynamical processes

cold ($\sigma \sim 50\rm\ km\ sec^{-1}$) population that we propose is in the
foreground disk, consisting of giants with 2MASS $Ks<5.5$, and a kinematically
hot ($\sigma \sim 100\rm\ km\ sec^{-1}$) candidate bulge/bar population for
most giants with $Ks>5.5$. Only the kinematically hot giants with $Ks>5.5$
include the reddest stars. Adopting 8.3 kpc to the Galactic Center, and
correcting for foreground extinction, we find that most of the sources have

intermediate age, AGB stars. We note some tension between the possibly
intermediate age of the kinematically hot population, and its high velocity
dispersion compared to the disk.

mJy ($0.1\times 10^{-26}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ Hz$^{-1}$) at 213 GHz, 1 Lsun
($6\times 10^{-29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ Hz$^{-1}$) in optical if our

limits are an order of magnitude less constraining than previous limits because
we use a more realistic ejecta absorption model based on three-dimensional
neutrino-driven SN explosion models (presented in an accompanying article). The
allowed bolometric luminosity of the compact object is 22 Lsun if our
line-of-sight is free of ejecta dust, or 138 Lsun if dust-obscured. Depending
on assumptions, these values limit the effective temperature of a neutron star
to <4-8 MK and do not exclude models, which typically are in the range 3-4 MK.
For the simplest accretion model, the accretion rate for an efficiency $\eta$
is limited to $< 10^{-11} \eta^{-1}$ Msun yr$^{-1}$, which excludes most
predictions. For pulsar activity modeled by a rotating magnetic dipole in
vacuum, the limit on the magnetic field strength ($B$) for a given spin period
($P$) is $B < 10^{14} P^2$ G s$^{-2}$. By combining information about radiation
reprocessing and geometry, it is likely that the compact object is a
dust-obscured thermally-emitting neutron star, which may appear as a region of
higher-temperature ejecta dust emission.

bulk material (per atomic layer) and a single isolated layer. The proposed
method is (i) tremendously lower in computational cost than the traditional
approach since it does not require calculations on thick slabs, (ii) still
valid even if there is a surface reconstruction of any kind, (iii) capable of
taking into account the relaxation of the single exfoliated layer (both
in-plane lattice parameters and atomic positions), and (iv) easily combined
with all kinds of many-body computational methods. As a proof of principles, we
calculated exfoliation energies of graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, MoS$_2$
and phosphorene using density-functional theory. In addition, we found that the
in-plane relaxation of an exfoliated layer accounts for 5% of one-layer
exfoliation energy of phosphorene while it is negligible (< 0.4%) in the other
cases.

explosion asymmetries. The optical depths below 2 keV for progenitors with a
remaining hydrogen envelope are expected to be high during the first century
after the explosion due to photoabsorption. A typical optical depth is $100
t_4^{-2} E^{-2}$, where $t_4$ is the time since the explosion in units of 10
000 days (${\sim}$27 years) and $E$ the energy in units of keV. Compton
scattering dominates above 50 keV, but the scattering depth is lower and
reaches unity already at ${\sim}$1000 days at 1 MeV. The optical depths are
approximately an order of magnitude lower for hydrogen-stripped progenitors.
The metallicity of the SN ejecta is much higher than in the interstellar
medium, which enhances photoabsorption and makes absorption edges stronger.
These results are applicable to young SN remnants in general, but we explore
the effects on observations of SN 1987A and the compact object in Cas A in
detail. For SN 1987A, the absorption is high and the X-ray upper limits of
${\sim}$100 Lsun on a compact object are approximately an order of magnitude
less constraining than previous estimates using other absorption models. The
details are presented in an accompanying paper. For the central compact object
in Cas A, we find no significant effects of our more detailed absorption model

Whether this remains true in the presence of interactions is a challenging
question because a flat dispersion usually leads to highly correlated ground
states. Here we compute numerically the ground state energy of lattice models
with completely flat band structure in a ring geometry. We find that the energy
as a function of the magnetic flux threading the ring has a half-flux quantum
$\Phi_0/2 = hc/(2e)$ period, indicating that only bound pairs of particles with

localized. We show analytically in one dimension that in fact the whole
many-body spectrum has the same periodicity. Our analytical arguments are valid
for both bosons and fermions, for generic interactions respecting some
symmetries of the lattice and at arbitrary temperatures. Moreover we construct
an extensive number of exact conserved quantities for the one dimensional
lattice models. These conserved quantities are associated to the occupation of
localized single quasiparticle states. Our results imply that in lattice models
with flat bands preformed pairs dominate transport even above the critical
temperature of the transition to a superfluid state.

the characteristic topological features of the state. In this article we
examine the constraints that arise when different symmetries are imposed
simultaneously on the local tensor such as internal $SU(2)$, point group and
translation symmetry. We show how the interplay of these symmetries manifests
in the entanglement spectrum which is the main diagnostic tool for chiral
topological order. We apply our results to a spin liquid PEPS introduced
previously as a chiral generalization of the resonating valence bond state. Our
findings explain the discrepancies observed between the entanglement spectrum
of this state and the expected edge spectrum described by a chiral conformal

an additional $U(1)$ symmetry we are able to resolve these discrepancies and
obtain an entanglement spectrum with the expected state countings and conformal

examination of macroscopic transport or optical properties. Here we demonstrate
a powerful direct approach by visualizing the wave functions of bismuth surface
states with a scanning tunneling microscope. Strong spin-orbit coupling on the

spectroscopic measurements reveal that this degeneracy is fully lifted at high

determine the nature of valley ordering by imaging the broken symmetry Landau
level (LL) wave functions. The remarkable spatial features of singly degenerate
LL wave functions near isolated defects contain unique signatures of
interference between spin-textured valleys, which identify the electronic
ground state as a quantum Hall ferroelectric. Our observations confirm the
recent prediction that interactions in strongly anisotropic valley systems
favor the occupation of a single valley, giving rise to emergent

to the daily nutrient changes in their environment. A striking example is
provided by cyanobacteria, which perform photosynthesis during the day to fix
carbon. These organisms not only face the challenge of rewiring their proteome
every 12 hours, but also the necessity of storing the fixed carbon in the form
of glycogen to fuel processes during the night. In this manuscript, we extend
the framework developed by Hwa and coworkers (Scott et al., Science 330, 1099
(2010)) for quantifying the relatinship between growth and proteome composition
to circadian metabolism. We then apply this framework to investigate the
circadian metabolism of the cyanobacterium Cyanothece, which not only fixes
carbon during the day, but also nitrogen during the night, storing it in the
polymer cyanophycin. Our analysis reveals that the need to store carbon and
nitrogen tends to generate an extreme growth strategy, in which the cells
predominantly grow during the day, as observed experimentally. This strategy
maximizes the growth rate over 24 hours, and can be quantitatively understood
by the bacterial growth laws. Our analysis also shows that the slow relaxation
of the proteome, arising from the slow growth rate, puts a severe constraint on
implementing this optimal strategy. Yet, the capacity to estimate the time of
the day, enabled by the circadian clock, makes it possible to anticipate the
daily changes in the environment and mount a response ahead of time. This
significantly enhances the growth rate by counteracting the detrimental effects

burdens from the original relaxion proposal. What eventually stops the

production of particles whose mass is controlled by the Higgs vacuum
expectation value. We first show that Higgs particle production does not work
for that purpose as the Higgs field does not track the minimum of its potential
in the regime where Higgs particles get efficiently produced through their
coupling to the relaxion. We then focus on gauge boson production. We provide a
detailed analysis of the scanning and stopping mechanism and determine the
parameter space for which the relaxion mechanism can take place after
inflation, while being compatible with cosmological constraints, such as the
relaxion dark matter overabundance and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We find that
the cutoff scale can be as high as two hundreds of TeV. In this approach, the

  Both our algorithms make use of a tree decomposition of the input chordal

the tree decomposition of the input graph, thereby partitioning the vertex set
into $O(\log n)$ layers. For coloring, each interval graph is colored
independently, which results in various coloring conflicts between the layers.
These conflicts are then resolved in a separate phase, using the particular
structure of our partitioning. For independent set, only the first $O( \log

d quasi-periodic oscillations, respectively. Both values appear to be closely
related with the stellar rotation period, as they might be created by changing
visibility of a hot-spot formed near the magnetic pole directed towards the
observer. These major light variations were superimposed on a chaotic,
flaring-type activity caused by hot-spots resulting from unstable accretion - a
situation reminiscent of that in 2011, when TW Hya showed signs of a moderately
stable accretion state. In 2015 only drifting quasi-periods were observed,
similar to those present in 2008-2009 data and typical for magnetised stars
accreting in a strongly unstable regime. A rich set of multi-colour data was
obtained during 2013-2017 with the primary aim to characterize the basic
spectral properties of the mysterious occultations in TW Hya. Although several
possible occultation-like events were identified, they are not as well defined
as in the 2011 MOST data. The new ground-based and MOST data show a dozen
previously unnoticed flares, as well as small-amplitude, 11 min - 3 hr
brightness variations, associated with 'accretion bursts'. It is not excluded
that the shortest 11-15 min variations could also be caused by thermal
instability oscillations in an accretion shock.

existence of a unique-deterministic, non-interactive, DKG-friendly threshold
signatures scheme. The only known examples of such a scheme are pairing-based
and derived from BLS.
  The DFINITY blockchain is layered on top of the DFINITY beacon and uses the

""weight"" is attributed to a chain based on the ranks of the leaders who propose
the blocks in the chain, and that weight is used to select between competing

the beacon as its source of randomness for leader selection and leader ranking
blockchain is further hardened by a notarization process which dramatically
improves the time to finality and eliminates the nothing-at-stake and selfish

  DFINITY consensus algorithm is made to scale through continuous quorum
selections driven by the random beacon. In practice, DFINITY achieves block
times of a few seconds and transaction finality after only two confirmations.
The system gracefully handles temporary losses of network synchrony including
network splits, while it is provably secure under synchrony.

accessible analytic tools. To overcome this limitation, we have created the
Washington University- Neonatal EEG Analysis Toolbox (WU-NEAT), containing two
of the most commonly used tools, provided in an open-source,
clinically-validated package running within MATLAB. Methods: The first
algorithm is the amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG), which is generated by
filtering, rectifying and time-compressing the original EEG recording, with
subsequent semi-logarithmic display. The second algorithm is the spectral edge
frequency (SEF), calculated as the critical frequency below which a user-
defined proportion of the EEG spectral power is located. The aEEG algorithm was
validated by three experienced reviewers. Reviewers evaluated aEEG recordings
of fourteen preterm/term infants, displayed twice in random order, once using a
reference algorithm and again using the WU-NEAT aEEG algorithm. Using standard
methodology, reviewers assigned a background pattern classification.
Inter/intra-rater reliability was assessed. For the SEF, calculations were made
using the same fourteen recordings, first with the reference and then with the
WU-NEAT algorithm. Results were compared using Pearson's correlation
coefficient. Results: For the aEEG algorithm, intra- and inter-rater
reliability was 100% and 98%, respectively. For the SEF, the mean (SD) Pearson
correlation coefficient between algorithms was 0.96 (0.04). Conclusion: We have
demonstrated a clinically-validated toolbox for generating the aEEG as well as
calculating the SEF from EEG data. Open-source access will enable widespread
use of common analytic algorithms which are device-independent and not subject
to obsolescence, thereby facilitating future collaborative research in neonatal

emergence of these regions in the object localization maps. Then, we design a
generic classification network equipped with convolutional blocks of different

effectively benefit both weakly- and semi- supervised semantic segmentation.

an objective function when a point is moved away from the optimal set. They
have recently received increasing attention in the field of optimization for

contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we develop fast and
intermediate rates of empirical risk minimization (ERM) under EBC for risk
minimization with Lipschitz continuous, and smooth convex random functions.
Second, we establish fast and intermediate rates of an efficient stochastic
approximation (SA) algorithm for risk minimization with Lipschitz continuous
random functions, which requires only one pass of $n$ samples and adapts to
EBC. For both approaches, the convergence rates span a full spectrum between
$\widetilde O(1/\sqrt{n})$ and $\widetilde O(1/n)$ depending on the power
constant in EBC, and could be even faster than $O(1/n)$ in special cases for
ERM. Moreover, these convergence rates are automatically adaptive without using
any knowledge of EBC. Overall, this work not only strengthens the understanding
of ERM for statistical learning but also brings new fast stochastic algorithms

treatment. We facilitate scalable sampling-based posterior inference by
exploitation of the combinatorial structure of the factor conditionals. Maximum
a posteriori decompositions feature higher accuracies than existing techniques
throughout a wide range of simulated conditions. Moreover, the probabilistic
approach facilitates the treatment of missing data and enables model selection
with much greater accuracy. We investigate three real-world data-sets. First,
temporal interaction networks in a hospital ward and behavioural data of
university students demonstrate the inference of instructive latent patterns.
Next, we decompose a tensor with more than 10 billion data points, indicating
relations of gene expression in cancer patients. Not only does this demonstrate
scalability, it also provides an entirely novel perspective on relational
properties of continuous data and, in the present example, on the molecular
heterogeneity of cancer. Our implementation is available on GitHub:

statistics, the current tools for density estimation and population comparison
on spheres are quite limited. Popular approaches for comparing populations (on
Euclidean domains) mostly involvea two-step procedure: (1) estimate probability
density functions (pdfs) from their respective samples, most commonly using the
kernel density estimator, and, (2) compare pdfs using a metric such as the L2
norm. However, both the estimated pdfs and their differences depend heavily on
the chosen kernels, bandwidths, and sample sizes. Here we develop a framework
for comparing spherical populations that is robust to these choices.
Essentially, we characterize pdfs on spherical domains by quantifying their
smoothness. Our framework uses a spectral representation, with densities
represented by their coefficients with respect to the eigenfunctions of the
Laplacian operator on a sphere. The change in smoothness, akin to using
different kernel bandwidths, is controlled by exponential decays in coefficient
values. Then we derive a proper distance for comparing pdf coefficients while
equalizing smoothness levels, negating influences of sample size and bandwidth.
This signifies a fair and meaningful comparisons of populations, despite vastly
different sample sizes, and leads to a robust and improved performance. We
demonstrate this framework using examples of variables on S1 and S2, and
evaluate its performance using a number of simulations and real data
experiments.

characteristic of light curves produced by starspots and stellar rotation
periods. The characteristic we examine is whether the light curve exhibits one
dip or two during a single rotation. We analyze thousands of Kepler light
curves of main sequence stars from 3200-6200K. Almost all the stars exhibit
segments of their light curve that contain either single or double dip segments
(very few have more than two significant dips per rotation). We define a
variable, the ""single/double ratio"" (SDR) that expresses the ratio of the time
spent in single mode to the time spent in double mode. Unexpectedly, there is a
strong relationship between the SDR and the stellar rotation period, in the
sense that longer periods come with a larger fraction of double segments. Even
more unexpectedly, the slopes of the SDR-Period relations are a clear function
of stellar temperature. We also show that the relationships of spot variability
amplitude (R_var) to rotation period have similar levels of scatter, slopes,
and dependence on temperature as the SDR-Period relations. Finally, the median
R_var of single segments tends to be about twice that of double segments in a
given light curve. We offer some tentative interpretations of these new results
in terms of starspot coverage and lifetimes. It will be fruitful to look
further into this novel ""rotation-activity"" relation, and better understand
what information these aspects of light curve morphology bring to our knowledge
of stellar magnetic activity.

distribution composed of core and strahl subpopulations. The core is modeled by
a drifting Maxwellian distribution, while the strahl is modeled by an analytic
function recently derived in (Horaites et al. 2018) from the collisional
kinetic equation. We perform a numerical linear stability analysis using the
LEOPARD solver (Astfalk & Jenko 2017), which allows for arbitrary gyrotropic
distribution functions in a magnetized plasma. We find that for typical solar
wind conditions, the core-strahl distribution is unstable to the kinetic
Alfv\'en and magnetosonic modes. The maximum growth rates for these
instabilities occur at wavenumbers $k d_i \lesssim 1$, at moderately oblique
angles of propagation, thus providing a potential source of kinetic-scale
turbulence. In contrast with previous reports, we however do not find evidence
for a whistler instability directly associated with the electron strahl. This
may be related to the more realistic shape of the electron strahl distribution
function adopted in our work. We therefore suggest that the whistler modes
often invoked to explain anomalous scattering of strahl particles could appear
as a result of nonlinear mode coupling and turbulent cascade originating at
scales $k d_i \lesssim 1$.

  Constrained Trajectory Optimization for Linear Systems","8 pages, 3 figures",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies closed-loop chance constrained control problems with
disturbance feedback (equivalently state feedback) where state and input
vectors must remain in a prescribed polytopic safe region with a predefined
confidence level. We propose to use a scenario approach where the uncertainty
is replaced with a set of random samples (scenarios). Though a standard form of
scenario approach is applicable in principle, it typically requires a large
number of samples to ensure the required confidence levels. To resolve this
drawback, we propose a method to reduce the computational complexity by
eliminating the redundant samples and, more importantly, by truncating the less
informative samples. Unlike the prior methods that start from the full sample
set and remove the less informative samples at each step, we sort the samples
in a descending order by first finding the most dominant ones. In this process
the importance of each sample is measured via a proper mapping. Then the most
dominant samples can be selected based on the allowable computational
complexity and the rest of the samples are truncated offline. The truncation
error is later compensated for by adjusting the safe regions via properly
designed buffers, whose sizes are functions of the feedback gain and the
truncation error.

shown that this output is sufficient to perform CT imaging of large cluttered

60sec. at the x-ray dose levels lower than the permitted limit of 5mGy. A steel
tank phantom with 2m diameter including different materials was used. The MV CT
images were generated at 3.5MV, 6MV, and 9MV beam energies. The materials were
separated based on their CT numbers as well as using dual energy subtraction
method. The materials with close densities and x-ray attenuations such as W and

The boundary conditions for the system design were determined including scan

on the findings of this feasibility study, it is concluded that the MV cargo CT

observed vulnerabilities of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). We demonstrate that
introducing randomness to the DNN models is sufficient to defeat adversarial
attacks, given that the adversary does not have an unlimited attack budget.
Instead of making one specific DNN model robust to perfect knowledge attacks
(a.k.a, white box attacks), creating randomness within an army of DNNs
completely eliminates the possibility of perfect knowledge acquisition,
resulting in a significantly more robust DNN ensemble against the strongest
form of attacks. We also show that when the adversary has an unlimited budget
of data perturbation, all defensive techniques would eventually break down as
the budget increases. Therefore, it is important to understand the game saddle
point where the adversary would not further pursue this endeavor.
  Furthermore, we explore the relationship between attack severity and decision
boundary robustness in the version space. We empirically demonstrate that by
simply adding a small Gaussian random noise to the learned weights, a DNN model
can increase its resilience to adversarial attacks by as much as 74.2%. More
importantly, we show that by randomly activating/revealing a model from a pool
of pre-trained DNNs at each query request, we can put a tremendous strain on
the adversary's attack strategies. We compare our randomization techniques to
the Ensemble Adversarial Training technique and show that our randomization
techniques are superior under different attack budget constraints.

outstanding questions remain that hinder widespread adoption. Namely, how do
sampling strategies explore conformational space and how might this influence
predictions? Here, we seek to answer these questions for four commonly used
sampling methods: 1) a long simulation, 2) many short simulations, 3) adaptive
sampling, and 4) FAST. We first develop a theoretical framework for
analytically calculating the probability of discovering states and uncover the
drastic effects of varying the number and length of simulations. We then use
kinetic Monte Carlo simulations on a variety of physically inspired landscapes
to characterize state discovery and transition pathways. Consistently, we find
that FAST simulations discover target states with the highest probability and
traverse realistic pathways. Furthermore, we uncover the pathology that short
parallel simulations sometimes predict an incorrect transition pathway by
crossing large energy barriers that long simulations would typically
circumnavigate, which we refer to as pathway tunneling. To protect against
tunneling, we introduce FAST-string, which samples along the highest-flux
transition paths to refine an MSMs transition probabilities and discriminate
between competing pathways. Additionally, we compare MSM estimators in
describing thermodynamics and kinetics. For adaptive sampling, we recommend
normalizing the transition counts out of each state after adding pseudo-counts
to avoid creating sources or sinks. Lastly, we evaluate our insights from
simple landscapes with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the folding
of the {\lambda}-repressor protein. We find that FAST-contacts predicts the
same folding pathway as long simulations but with orders of magnitude less
simulation time.

linguistic context. In this paper, we investigate the role of context in an
LSTM LM, through ablation studies. Specifically, we analyze the increase in
perplexity when prior context words are shuffled, replaced, or dropped. On two
standard datasets, Penn Treebank and WikiText-2, we find that the model is
capable of using about 200 tokens of context on average, but sharply
distinguishes nearby context (recent 50 tokens) from the distant history. The
model is highly sensitive to the order of words within the most recent
sentence, but ignores word order in the long-range context (beyond 50 tokens),
suggesting the distant past is modeled only as a rough semantic field or topic.
We further find that the neural caching model (Grave et al., 2017b) especially
helps the LSTM to copy words from within this distant context. Overall, our
analysis not only provides a better understanding of how neural LMs use their
context, but also sheds light on recent success from cache-based models.

the transmission of these forces to the cellular scale, our understanding of
this process remains incomplete. Here we investigate the transmission of forces
through the network at the individual filament level, and show that active

force ""plucks"" the fiber and induces a nonlinear tension. In stiff and densely
connnected networks, this tension results in large network-wide tensile
stresses that far exceed the expectation drawn from a linear elastic theory.
This amplification mechanism competes with a recently characterized
network-level amplification due to fiber buckling, suggesting that that fiber

rate possible with vanishing error cannot be improved by allowing a fixed
error. Building on a method introduced by Gu and Effros for centralized coding
problems, we develop a general and simple recipe for proving strong converse
that is applicable for distributed problems as well. Heuristically, our proof
of strong converse mimics the standard steps for proving a weak converse,
except that we apply those steps to a modified distribution obtained by
conditioning the original distribution on the event that no error occurs. A key
component of our recipe is the replacement of the hard Markov constraints
implied by the distributed nature of the problem with a soft information cost
using a variational formula introduced by Oohama. We illustrate our method by
providing a short proof of the strong converse for the Wyner-Ziv problem and
strong converse theorems for interactive function computation, common
randomness and secret key agreement, and the wiretap channel; the latter three
strong converse problems were open prior to this work.

  Analysis",,"10.1016/j.media.2019.02.009",,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Weakly-supervised learning based on, e.g., partially labelled images or
image-tags, is currently attracting significant attention in CNN segmentation
as it can mitigate the need for full and laborious pixel/voxel annotations.
Enforcing high-order (global) inequality constraints on the network output (for
instance, to constrain the size of the target region) can leverage unlabeled
data, guiding the training process with domain-specific knowledge. Inequality
constraints are very flexible because they do not assume exact prior knowledge.
However, constrained Lagrangian dual optimization has been largely avoided in
deep networks, mainly for computational tractability reasons. To the best of
our knowledge, the method of [Pathak et al., 2015] is the only prior work that
addresses deep CNNs with linear constraints in weakly supervised segmentation.
It uses the constraints to synthesize fully-labeled training masks (proposals)
from weak labels, mimicking full supervision and facilitating dual
optimization. We propose to introduce a differentiable penalty, which enforces
inequality constraints directly in the loss function, avoiding expensive
Lagrangian dual iterates and proposal generation. From constrained-optimization
perspective, our simple penalty-based approach is not optimal as there is no
guarantee that the constraints are satisfied. However, surprisingly, it yields
substantially better results than the Lagrangian-based constrained CNNs in
[Pathak et al., 2015], while reducing the computational demand for training. By
annotating only a small fraction of the pixels, the proposed approach can reach
a level of segmentation performance that is comparable to full supervision on
three separate tasks. While our experiments focused on basic linear constraints
such as the target-region size and image tags, our framework can be easily
extended to other non-linear constraints.

captures information about the structure and spatial organization of
macromolecular complexes within single cells, in near-native state and at
sub-molecular resolution. Although template matching is often used to locate
macromolecules in a CECT image, it is insufficient as it only measures the
relative structural similarity. Therefore, it is preferable to assess the
statistical credibility of the decision through hypothesis testing, requiring
many templates derived from a diverse population of macromolecular structures.
Due to the very limited number of known structures, we need a generative model
to efficiently and reliably sample pseudo-structures from the complex
distribution of macromolecular structures. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel image-derived approach for performing hypothesis testing for
template matching by constructing generative models using the generative
adversarial network. Finally, we conducted hypothesis testing experiments for
template matching on both simulated and experimental subtomograms, allowing us
to conclude the identity of subtomograms with high statistical credibility and

recover direction-aware spatial context (DSC) for detecting and removing

convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the DSC features at different
levels. Moreover, we design a weighted cross entropy loss to make effective the
training for shadow detection and further adopt the network for shadow removal
by using a Euclidean loss function and formulating a color transfer function to
address the color and luminosity inconsistencies in the training pairs. We
employed two shadow detection benchmark datasets and two shadow removal

mergers are an important r-process site. Astrophysical simulations of neutron
star mergers and core collapse supernovae are making rapid progress. Detection
of both, electron neutrinos and antineutrinos from the next galactic supernova
will constrain the composition of neutrino-driven winds and provide unique
nucleosynthesis information. Finally FRIB and other rare-isotope beam

neutron-rich nuclei that are involved in the r-process. The new capabilities
can significantly improve our understanding of the r-process and likely resolve
one of the main outstanding problems in classical nuclear astrophysics.

generalize the scalar transfer factors of endoscopy. These transfer operators
have all properties that one could expect from a trace formula comparison:
matching, fundamental lemma for the Hecke algebra, transfer of (relative)
characters. Most importantly, and quite surprisingly, they appear to be of
abelian nature (at least, in the low-rank examples considered in this paper),
even though they encompass functoriality relations of non-abelian harmonic
analysis. Thus, they are amenable to application of the Poisson summation
formula in order to perform the global comparison. Moreover, we show that these
abelian transforms have some structure -- which presently escapes our
understanding in its entirety -- as deformations of well-understood operators

$\operatorname{SL}_2$ with the Kuznetsov formula) and Venkatesh's 2002 thesis
(providing a ""beyond endoscopy"" proof of functorial transfer from tori to
$\operatorname{GL}_2$). As it turns out, the latter is not completely disjoint
from endoscopic transfer -- in fact, our proof ""factors"" through endoscopic
transfer. We also study the functional equation of the symmetric-square
$L$-function for $\operatorname{GL}_2$, and show that it is governed by an
explicit ""Hankel operator"" at the level of the Kuznetsov formula, which is also
of abelian nature. A similar theory for the standard $L$-function was
previously developed (in a different language) by Jacquet.

novel index structure is proposed, called HOC-Tree, which is based on Hilbert
curve and OC-Tree, and takes both spatial and temporal information into
consideration. Based on HOC-Tree, we develop an efficient algorithm to solve
the problem of spatio-temporal range search. Comprehensive experiments on real
and synthetic data demonstrate that our method is more efficient than the
state-of-the-art technique.

random self-affine Bedford-McMullen carpets. Previous work has revealed that
the (related) Assouad dimension is not sufficiently sensitive to distinguish
between subtle changes in the random model, since it tends to be almost surely
`as large as possible' (a deterministic quantity). This has been verified in
conformal and non-conformal settings. In the conformal setting, the Assouad
spectrum and quasi-Assouad dimension behave rather differently, tending to
almost surely coincide with the upper box dimension. Here we investigate the
non-conformal setting and find that the Assouad spectrum and quasi-Assouad
dimension generally do not coincide with the box dimension or Assouad

these notions. Our proofs combine deterministic covering techniques with
suitably adapted Chernoff estimates and Borel-Cantelli type arguments.

model is considered. Its formulation is to maximize the worst-case
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), incorporating a positive
semidefinite constraint on the actual covariance matrix of the desired signal.
In the literature, semidefinite program (SDP) techniques, together with others,
have been applied to approximately solve this problem. Herein an inner
second-order cone program (SOCP) approximate algorithm is proposed to solve it.
In particular, a sequence of SOCPs are constructed and solved, while the SOCPs
have the nondecreasing optimal values and converge to a locally optimal value
(it is in fact a globally optimal value through our extensive simulations). As
a result, our algorithm does not use computationally heavy SDP relaxation
technique. To validate our inner approximation results, simulation examples are
presented, and they demonstrate the improved performance of the new robust
beamformer in terms of the averaged cpu-time (indicating how fast the
algorithms converge) in a high signal-to-noise region.

sequential measurements is defined through the violation of macrorealistic
inequalities, known as Leggett-Garg inequalities (LGI). We investigate the
energy cost of the process associated with the Leggett-Garg test in the context
of noiseless and Markovian noise for arbitrary initial states. We prove that in
noiseless and in certain noisy scenarios, the maximal violations of LGI under
the energy constraint occurs when the average energy of the process is equal to
the negative of the energy of the initial state. Such a dependence of LGI on
the choice of the initial state is not seen in the unconstrained case.
Moreover, we find that in the presence of a moderate amount of Markovian noise,
the amount of violation of LGI remains almost unaltered with a suitable choice
of the evolution and dephasing operators in the neighborhood of the maximal
violation line, thereby showing the robustness of temporal correlations under
environmental effects.

computational time by using the idea of distillation. Specifically, we first
train a teacher network which looks at all the frames in a video and computes a
representation for the video. We then train a student network whose objective
is to process only a small fraction of the frames in the video and still
produce a representation which is very close to the representation computed by
the teacher network. This smaller student network involving fewer computations
can then be employed at inference time for video classification. We experiment
with the YouTube-8M dataset and show that the proposed student network can
reduce the inference time by upto 30% with a very small drop in the performance

emission, absorption, and particle acceleration and (2) performing
time-dependent polarized radiative transfer. M87 serves as an exemplary
prototype for this investigation due to its prominent and well-studied jet and
the imminent prospect of learning much more from Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)

real observations for observational signatures such as jet instabilities,
collimation, relativistic beaming, and polarization. The simplest models
described adopt the standard equipartition hypothesis; other models calculate
emission by relating it to current density or shear. These models are intended
for application to the radio jet instead of the higher frequency emission, the

approached has been characterised through the Adam-Gibbs relation, which
relates relaxation time scales to the configurational entropy. The Adam-Gibbs
relation cannot apply simultaneously to all relaxation times scales unless they
are coupled, and exhibit closely related temperature dependences. The breakdown
of the Stokes-Einstein relation presents an interesting situation to the
contrary, and in analysing it, it has recently been shown that the Adam-Gibbs
relation applies to diffusion coefficients rather than to viscosity or
structural relaxation times related to the decay of density fluctuations.
However, for multi-component liquids -- the typical cases considered in
computer simulations, metallic glass formers, etc. -- such a statement raises
the question of which diffusion coefficient is described by the Adam-Gibbs
relation. All diffusion coefficients can be consistently described by the
Adam-Gibbs relation if they bear a power law relationship with each other.
Remarkably, we find that for a wide range of glass formers, and for a wide
range of temperatures spanning the normal and the slow relaxation regimes, such
a relationship holds. We briefly discuss possible rationalisations of the
observed behaviour.

formation of cat-states in phase-space. Participation ratio (PR) a measure of

distribution tendency were observed in these sources, though it has to be
confirmed with improved statistics. We also found that, the standard deviation

study on three additional brightest unclassified blazars to identify their flux

distribution, we infer these unclassified blazars may be closely associated

can largely under estimate the nominal flux and this discrepancy can propagate
down to the estimation of source parameters through spectral modeling.

superconductors. The width of the Delta H = Delta B section along the number of
defects and Hc2 was estimated assuming that defects are in the ideal state, and
compared with experimental results. We hypothesized that pinned fluxes have to
be picked out from the defect and move into an inside of a superconductor
regardless free energy depth of the defect if the distance between fluxes
pinned at the defect is equal to the one of upper critical field. It is
considered that the reason that this phenomenon has not been reported yet is
the flux jump of the volume defect dominating superconductor. The section means
that the fluxes that have penetrated into a inside of a superconductor in which
volume defects exist are preferentially pinned on them over the entire specimen
before Ginzburg-Landau behavior. If the size of volume defects is uniform in
some extent, the influence of the planar and line defects is small and the flux

policy of an agent to the target task from the source task. Given their
successes on robotic action planning, current methods mostly rely on two
requirements: exactly-relevant expert demonstrations or the explicitly-coded
cost function on target task, both of which, however, are inconvenient to
obtain in practice. In this paper, we relax these two strong conditions by
developing a novel task transfer framework where the expert preference is
applied as a guidance. In particular, we alternate the following two steps:
Firstly, letting experts apply pre-defined preference rules to select related
expert demonstrates for the target task. Secondly, based on the selection
result, we learn the target cost function and trajectory distribution
simultaneously via enhanced Adversarial MaxEnt IRL and generate more
trajectories by the learned target distribution for the next preference
selection. The theoretical analysis on the distribution learning and
convergence of the proposed algorithm are provided. Extensive simulations on
several benchmarks have been conducted for further verifying the effectiveness
of the proposed method.

components, such as entities, types and relations, are widely used for entity
mention disambiguation, relation inference and deep question answering. Great
strides have been made in modeling general, asymmetric or antisymmetric KG
relations using Gaussian, holographic, and complex embeddings. None of these
directly enforce transitivity inherent in the is-instance-of and is-subtype-of
relations. A recent proposal, called order embedding (OE), demands that the
vector representing a subtype elementwise dominates the vector representing a
supertype. However, the manner in which such constraints are asserted and
evaluated have some limitations. In this short research note, we make three
contributions specific to representing and inferring transitive relations.
First, we propose and justify a significant improvement to the OE loss
objective. Second, we propose a new representation of types as
hyper-rectangular regions, that generalize and improve on OE. Third, we show
that some current protocols to evaluate transitive relation inference can be
misleading, and offer a sound alternative. Rather than use black-box deep

understand variability mechanisms at short and long time scales, spectral
behaviour in different energy regimes and to estimate sizes and location of the

obtained from Fermi-LAT, Swift-XRT/UVOT, Steward, Mt Abu Infrared Observatory
and OVRO. These are analyzed to construct MW light curves, extract the spectral

that CTA102 attained the highest ever flux levels across the EMS while flaring
and otherwise, with rapid and prolonged activities at all the frequencies. A
number of short term (3 to 8 days) and long term (>month) variability events
are noticed across the EMS. We infer a redder when brighter trend in faint
state and a bluer when brighter trend during a few optical flares. Based on the
flux doubling timescale, the size of the gamma-ray emitting region is estimated
as 8.76x10^{15}cm, located at a distance of about 5.58x10^{16} cm from the
central engine. CTA102 was in extremely bright phase during 2016-17, due
possibly to, successive high energy particle injections into the jet, creating
shocks traveling down the jet which lead to the overall flux enhancement across
the EMS. Alternatively, a decreasing viewing angle could also lead to the
enhanced flux. The study reveals correlated variations in all the energy bands,
with lags within time bins, indicating to co-spatial origin of the emissions.
During the flaring event, a BWB color in optical and harder when brighter trend
in X-ray and gamma-ray spectra are noticed.

points, respectively, along with daily averaged R-band data are used to address
inter-night and long-term variability and the color behavior of S5 0716+71. The
study suggests that the source shows significant intra-night variability with a
duty cycle of more than 31% and night-to-night variations. The average
brightness magnitudes in B, V, R & I bands were found to be 14.42(0.02),
14.02(0.01), 13.22(0.01) & 13.02(0.03), respectively, while S5 0716+714 was
historically brightest with R = 11.68 mag on 2015 January 18, indicating that
source was in relatively high state during this period. A mild bluer when
brighter behavior, typical of BL Lacs, supports the shock-in-jet model. We
notice larger amplitudes of variation when the source was relatively brighter.
Based on the shortest time scale of variability and causality argument, upper

investigate such interactions with clouds of higher density contrast. We
compare the adiabatic hydrodynamic interaction of a Mach 10 shock with a
spherical cloud of $\chi = 10^{3}$ with that of a cloud embedded in a wind with
identical parameters to the post-shock flow. We find that initially there are
only minor morphological differences between the shock-cloud and wind-cloud
interactions, compared to when $\chi = 10$. However, once the transmitted shock
exits the cloud, the development of a turbulent wake and fragmentation of the
cloud differs between the two simulations. On increasing the wind Mach number,
we note the development of a thin, smooth tail of cloud material, which is then
disrupted by the fragmentation of the cloud core and subsequent `mass-loading'
of the flow. We find that the normalized cloud mixing time ($t_{mix}$) is
shorter at higher $\chi$. However, a strong Mach number dependence on tmix and
the normalized cloud drag time, $t'_{drag}$, is not observed.
Mach-number-dependent values of $t_{mix}$ and $t'_{drag}$ from comparable
shock-cloud interactions converge towards the Mach-number-independent
time-scales of the wind-cloud simulations. We find that high $\chi$ clouds can
be accelerated up to 80-90 per cent of the wind velocity and travel large
distances before being significantly mixed. However, complete mixing is not
achieved in our simulations and at late times the flow remains perturbed.

Convergence toward grid-independent results is examined versus the grid

graph that changes over time), in the fundamental case where the underlying
static graph is a star. The aim of the exploration problem in a temporal star
is to find a temporal walk which starts at the center of the star, visits all
leafs, and eventually returns back to the center. We initiate a systematic
study of the computational complexity of this problem, depending on the number
k of time-labels that every edge is allowed to have; that is, on the number k
of time points where every edge can be present in the graph. To do so, we
distinguish between the decision version StarExp(k) asking whether a complete
exploration of the instance exists, and the maximization version MaxStarExp(k)
of the problem, asking for an exploration schedule of the greatest possible
number of edges in the star. We present here a collection of results
establishing the computational complexity of these two problems. On the one
hand, we show that both MaxStarExp(2) and StarExp(3) can be efficiently solved
in O(n log n) time on a temporal star with n vertices. On the other hand, we
show that, for every k >= 6, StarExp(k) is NP-complete and MaxStarExp(k) is
APX-hard, and thus it does not admit a PTAS, unless P = NP. The latter result
is complemented by a polynomial-time 2-approximation algorithm for
MaxStarExp(k), for every k, thus proving that MaxStarExp(k) is APX-complete.
Finally, we give a partial characterization of the classes of temporal stars
with random labels which are, asymptotically almost surely, yes-instances and
no-instances for StarExp(k) respectively.

have been many attempts to solve the tension between direct measurements of
$H_0$ and $\sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{0 {\rm m}}}$ from the respective low redshift
observables and indirect measurements of these quantities from the cosmic
microwave background (CMB). In this work we reconstruct a model independent
approach that boils down to different classes of cosmological models under
suitable parameters choices. We test this parameterization against the latest
Planck CMB data combined with recent BAO, SNeIa datasets and the R16 direct
$H_0$ measurements, and compare among different cosmological models. Our
analysis reveals that a strong positive correlation between $H_0$ and
$\sigma_8$ is more or less generic, irrespective of the choice of cosmological
models. We also find that present data slightly prefers a phantom equation of
state for dark energy and a slight negative value for effective equation of
state for dark matter (which is a direct signature of interacting models) with
a relatively high value for $H_0$ consistent with R16 and simultaneously, a
consistent value for $\Omega_{0 {\rm m}}$. Thus, even though the tensions
cannot be fully resolved, interacting models with phantom equation of state get
a slight edge over the others for currently available data. We also see that
allowing interaction between dark energy and dark matter may resolve the
tension between the high redshift CMB data and individual low redshift
datasets, but the low redshift datasets have inconsistencies between them (e.g.
between BAO and $H_0$, SNeIa and BAO, and cluster counts and $H_0$) that are
practically independent of the cosmological model.

(VLBI) radio and multi-wavelength flux density and polarization observations to
constrain the physics of the dissipation mechanism powering the broadband
flares in 3C 279 during an episode of extreme flaring activity in 2013-2014.
Six bright flares superimposed on a long-term outburst are detected at
$\gamma$-ray energies. Four of the flares have optical and radio counterparts.
The two modes of flaring activity (faster flares sitting on top of a long term
outburst) present at radio, optical, $\gamma$-ray frequencies are missing in
X-rays. X-ray counterparts are only observed for two flares. The first three
flares are accompanied by ejection of a new VLBI component (NC2) suggesting the
43 GHz VLBI core as the site of energy dissipation. Another new component, NC3,
is ejected after the last three flares, which suggests that the emission is
produced upstream from the core (closer to the black hole). The study therefore
indicates multiple sites of energy dissipation in the source. An
anti-correlation is detected between the optical percentage polarization (PP)
and optical/$\gamma$-ray flux variations, while the PP has a positive
correlation with optical/$\gamma$-rays spectral indices. Given that the mean
polarization is inversely proportional to the number of cells in the emission
region, the PP vs. optical/$\gamma$-ray anti-correlation could be due to more
active cells during the outburst than at other times. In addition to the
turbulent component, our analysis suggests the presence of a combined turbulent
and ordered magnetic field, with the ordered component transverse to the jet
axis.

interestingly, to our best knowledge, it has not been used for regression

constrains the type of the matter field in the chameleon model to be nearly a

evolution of the universe being described by one single scalar field. That is,
the effects of the chameleon and the inflaton can be described by one single

Minkowski. The system works without calibration, clock synchronizations, or a
priori knowledge about the motion of clocks, it is able to self-diagnose
hypotheses break down (for example, if one clock temporarily becomes not-freely
falling, or the gravitational field changes) and it is automatically back and
operational when the assumed conditions are restored. In the Schwarzschild
case, we show that the system can also best fit the gravitational mass of the
source of the gravitational field and stress that no weak field assumptions are
made anywhere. In particular, the rPS we propose can work in a region close to
the horizon since it does not use approximations or PPN expansions. More
generally, the rPS can be adapted as detectors for the gravitational field and
we shall briefly discuss their role in testing different theoretical settings
for gravity. In fact, rPS is a natural candidate for a canonical method to
extract observables out of a gravitational theory, an activity also known as
designing experiments to test gravity.

to the global yaw and the global position of the sensor platform. We further
prove that there are at least 5 (and 7) unobservable directions for the

station (BS) with limited uplink access channels. Each UE has a rechargeable
battery with finite capacity. The system control is modeled as a Markov
decision process without complete prior knowledge assumed at the BS, which also
deals with large sizes in both state and action spaces. First, to handle the
access control problem assuming causal battery and channel state information,
we propose a scheduling algorithm that maximizes the uplink transmission sum
rate based on reinforcement learning (RL) with deep Q-network (DQN)
enhancement. Second, for the battery prediction problem, with a fixed
round-robin access control policy adopted, we develop a RL based algorithm to
minimize the prediction loss (error) without any model knowledge about the
energy source and energy arrival process. Finally, the joint access control and
battery prediction problem is investigated, where we propose a two-layer RL
network to simultaneously deal with maximizing the sum rate and minimizing the
prediction loss: the first layer is for battery prediction, the second layer
generates the access policy based on the output from the first layer.
Experiment results show that the three proposed RL algorithms can achieve
better performances compared with existing benchmarks.

potential. It is now interesting to investigate the effect of this distortion
on the integral characteristics of the Bose-Einstein spectrum. The thermal
radiative and thermodynamic functions of the Bose-Einstein distribution are
such integral characteristics. These functions are as follows: a) the total
radiation power per unit area; b) total energy density; c) number density of
photons; d) grand potential density; e) Helmholtz free energy density; f)
entropy density; g) heat capacity at constant volume; h) enthalpy density; and
i) pressure. The exact analytical expressions are obtained for the temperature

astrophysical parameters, such as the entropy density/Boltzmann constant and
number density, created by the mu- distortion of the CMB spectrum.

downstream NLP applications. Though the task is mathematically defined,
semantic similarity's essence is to capture the notions of similarity
impregnated in humans. Machines use some heuristics to calculate the similarity
between words, but these are typically corpus dependent or are useful for
specific domains. The difference between Semantic Similarity and Semantic
Relatedness motivates the development of new algorithms. For a human, the word
car and road are probably as related as car and bus. But this may not be the
case for computational methods. Ontological methods are good at encoding
Semantic Similarity and Vector Space models are better at encoding Semantic
Relatedness. There is a dearth of methods which leverage ontologies to create
better vector representations. The aim of this proposal is to explore in the
direction of a hybrid method which combines statistical/vector space methods
like Word2Vec and Ontological methods like WordNet to leverage the advantages
provided by both.

this task, including 17813 questions. Furthermore, we systematically explore
the influences of vector representations, context features, and corpora on
analogical reasoning. With the experiments, CA8 is proved to be a reliable
benchmark for evaluating Chinese word embeddings.

played by infections that can result in a breakdown of immune tolerance,
primarily through the mechanism of ""molecular mimicry"". In this paper we
propose and analyse a stochastic model of immune response to a viral infection
and subsequent autoimmunity, with account for the populations of T cells with
different activation thresholds, regulatory T cells, and cytokines. We show
analytically and numerically how stochasticity can result in sustained
oscillations around deterministically stable steady states, and we also
investigate stochastic dynamics in the regime of bi-stability. These results
provide a possible explanation for experimentally observed variations in the
progression of autoimmune disease. Computations of the variance of stochastic
fluctuations provide practically important insights into how the size of these
fluctuations depends on various biological parameters, and this also gives a
headway for comparison with experimental data on variation in the observed
numbers of T cells and organ cells affected by infection.

decomposition (SVD) or eigenvalue decomposition (EIG) in real engineering
practices. However, these numerical algorithms suffer from uncertainty of
convergence in many cases. A novel fast symbolic solution is proposed in this
paper by following our recent publication in this journal. The equivalence
analysis shows that our previous solver can be converted to deal with the 3D
registration problem. Rather, the computation procedure is studied for further
simplification of computing without complex-number support. Experimental
results show that the proposed solver does not loose accuracy and robustness
but improves the execution speed to a large extent by almost %50 to %80, on
both personal computer and embedded processor.
