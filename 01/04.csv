$\Theta(\frac{n}{\log_\sigma n}\log\log_\sigma n)$. Our construction matches a
previously known upper bound and exhibits a weakness of this scheme, as the
information-theoretic lower bound is $\Omega(\frac{n}{\log_\sigma n})$. This
settles an open problem stated by Lohrey et al. [arXiv 2017], who designed a
more involved version achieving the lower bound. We show that this can be also
guaranteed by a very minor modification of the original scheme: informally, one
only needs to ensure that different parts of the tree are not compressed too
quickly. Arguably, our version is more uniform, and in particular, the
compression procedure is oblivious to the value of $\sigma$.

from $\mathcal{A}$ is calculated in constant time, irrespective of the length

redundancy must be given to the alphabet $\mathcal{A}$. The complexity of
parallel addition algorithm depends heavily on the size $\#\mathcal{A}$ of the
alphabet: the bigger alphabet is considered, the lower complexity of the
parallel addition algorithm may be reached, and vice versa. Here we aim to find
parallel addition algorithms on alphabets of the minimal possible size, for a
given base. As the complexity of these algorithms becomes quite huge in
general, we introduce a so-called Extending Window Method (EWM) - in fact an
algorithm to construct parallel addition algorithms. This method can be applied
on bases $\beta$ which are expanding algebraic integers, i.e., $\beta$ whose
all conjugates are greater than 1 in modulus. Convergence of the EWM is not
guaranteed, nevertheless, we have developed tools for revealing
non-convergence, and there is a number of successful applications. Firstly, the
EWM provides the same parallel addition algorithms as were previously
introduced by A. Avizienis, C.Y. Chow & J.E. Robertson or B. Parhami for
integer bases and alphabets. Then, by applying the EWM on selected complex
bases $\beta$ with non-integer alphabets $\mathcal{A} \subset

observed time of an event. For example, as a source moves radially toward or
away from an observer, the path length and therefore the light travel time to
the observer decreases or increases, causing the event to appear earlier or
later than otherwise expected, respectively. This light travel time effect
(LTTE) has been applied to transits and eclipses for a variety of purposes,
including studies of eclipse timing variations (ETVs) and transit timing
variations (TTVs) that reveal the presence of additional bodies in the system.
Here we highlight another non-relativistic effect on eclipse or transit times
arising from the finite speed of light---caused by an asymmetry in the
transverse velocity of the two eclipsing objects, relative to the observer.
This asymmetry can be due to a non-unity mass ratio or to the presence of
external barycentric motion. Although usually constant, this barycentric and
asymmetric transverse velocities (BATV) effect can vary between sequential
eclipses if either the path length between the two objects or the barycentric
transverse velocity varies in time. We discuss this BATV effect and estimate
its magnitude for both time-dependent and time-independent cases. For the
time-dependent cases, we consider binaries that experience a change in orbital
inclination, eccentric systems with and without apsidal motion, and
hierarchical triple systems. We also consider the time-independent case which,
by affecting the primary and secondary eclipses differently, can influence the
inferred system parameters, such as the orbital eccentricity.

strongly sensitive to environment and exhibits an enhanced splitting in

excited out of the defect states and the dominant transition is that of the
negatively charged exciton. Furthermore, upon excitation with a circularly
polarized light, the PL retains a degree of polarization reaching 50% and
inherited from the valley polarized photoexcited excitons. The studies of PL

therefore statistical information on the population of radio-loud AGN in their

radio-loud AGN in the Herschel-ATLAS field. Using a simple core-detection
method, we constrain the upper limit on the fraction of remnants in our

fades rapidly once the core/jets turn off. We also find that our remnant sample
has a wide range of spectral indices ($-1.5\leqslant
\alpha^{1400}_{150}\leqslant -0.5$), confirming that the lobes of some remnants
may possess flat spectra at low frequencies just as active sources do. We
suggest that, even with the unprecedented sensitivity of LOFAR, our sample may

entropy pursuit (L-MEP) is a universal compressed sensing algorithm that aims
at recovering $X^n$ from its linear measurements $Y^m=AX^n$, without having

minimum required sampling rates, in noiseless cases where such fundamental
limits are known. L-MEP is based on minimizing a cost function that consists of
a linear combination of the conditional empirical entropy of a potential
reconstruction vector and its corresponding measurement error. In this paper,
using a first-order linear approximation of the conditional empirical entropy
function, L-MEP is connected with Q-MAP. The established connection between
L-MEP and Q-MAP leads to variants of Q-MAP which have the same asymptotic
performance as Q-MAP in terms of their required sampling rates. Moreover, these
variants suggest that Q-MAP is robust to small error in estimating the source

excellent agreement with the prediction of chiral and superconducting random
matrix ensembles for eigenvalues separations smaller than the Thouless energy,
which seems to scale linearly with $N$. Deviations beyond the Thouless energy,
which describes how ergodicity is approached, are universality characterized by
a quadratic growth of the number variance. In the time domain, we have found

mean-square approximation of iterated Ito stochastic integrals based on
generalized multiple Fourier series converging in the sense of norm in the
space $L_2([t, T]^k)$ ($k$ is the multiplicity of the iterated Ito stochastic
integral). We obtain the exact and approximate expressions for the mean-square
approximation error of iterated Ito stochastic integrals of multiplicity $k$
($k\in\mathbb{N}$) from the stochastic Taylor-Ito expansion. As a result, we do
not need to use redundant terms of expansions of iterated Ito stochastic
integrals that complicate the numerical methods for Ito stochastic differential
equations. Moreover, we proved the convergence with propability 1 for the
method of expansion of iterated Ito stochastic integrals based on generalized
multiple Fourier series for the cases of multiple Fourier-Legendre series and
multiple trigonometric Fourier series. Mean-square approximation of iterated
Stratonovich stochastic integrals is also considered in the article. The
results of the article can be applied to the high-order strong numerical
methods for Ito stochastic differential equations as well as for
non-commutative semilinear stochastic partial differential equations with

non-smooth optimization owing to their simplicity and efficiency. In this
paper, we consider the Forward--Douglas--Rachford splitting method (FDR)
[10,40], and study both global and local convergence rates of this method. For
the global rate, we establish an $o(1/k)$ convergence rate in terms of a
Bregman divergence suitably designed for the objective function. Moreover, when
specializing to the case of Forward--Backward splitting method, we show that
convergence rate of the objective function of the method is actually $o(1/k)$
for a large choice of the descent step-size. Then locally, based on the
assumption that the non-smooth part of the optimization problem is partly
smooth, we establish local linear convergence of the method. More precisely, we
show that the sequence generated by FDR method first (i) identifies a smooth
manifold in a finite number of iteration, and then (ii) enters a local linear
convergence regime, which is for instance characterized in terms of the
structure of the underlying active smooth manifold. To exemplify the usefulness
of the obtained result, we consider several concrete numerical experiments

self-consistent understanding of the role of the reconnection electric field,
which extends substantially beyond the simple change of magnetic connections.
Rather, we find that the reconnection electric field is essential to
maintaining the current density in the diffusion region, which would otherwise
be dissipated by a set of processes. Natural candidates for current dissipation
are the average convection of current carriers away from the reconnection
region by the outflow of accelerated particles, or the average rotation of the
current density by the magnetic field reversal in the vicinity. Instead, we
show here that the current dissipation is the result of thermal effects,
underlying the statistical interaction of current-carrying particles with the
adjacent magnetic field. We find that this interaction serves to redirect the
directed acceleration of the reconnection electric field to thermal motion.
This thermalization manifests itself in form of quasi-viscous terms in the
thermal energy balance of the current layer. These quasi-viscous terms act to
increase the average thermal energy. Our predictions regarding current and
thermal energy balance are readily amenable to exploration in the laboratory or
by satellite missions, in particular, by NASAs Magnetospheric Multiscale
mission.

superfluidity in a ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate. Superfluidity
is possible only in the presence of uniaxial anisotropy (linear and quadratic
Zeeman effect). This follows from the topology of the order-parameter space
(vacuum manifold). According to the Landau criterion, the critical phase
gradients, both for mass and spin supercurrents, vanish at the phase transition
from the easy-plane to the easy-axis anisotropy. However, mass superfluidity is
still possible at the phase transition. This is because the Landau criterion
signals instability only with respect to nonsingular vortices with special
ratio between circulations of mass and spin currents. Phase slips produced by
these vortices are not sufficient for complete decay of supercurrents. Full
decay of supercurrents requires phase slips with vortices of another
topological class and larger energy. These phase slips are suppressed by
energetic barriers up to the upper critical velocity (gradient) exceeding the
Landau critical velocity. The upper critical velocity does not vanish nor has
any anomaly in the critical point at the phase transition from the easy-plane
to the easy-axis anisotropy.

This additional heat reduces the impact-velocity thresholds required to heat
the targets with the 0.1 projectile mass to temperatures for the onset of Ar

  equation",,,,,"math.NA physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many problems encountered in plasma physics require a description by kinetic
equations, which are posed in an up to six-dimensional phase space. A direct
discretization of this phase space, often called the Eulerian approach, has
many advantages but is extremely expensive from a computational point of view.
In the present paper we propose a dynamical low-rank approximation to the
Vlasov--Poisson equation, with time integration by a particular splitting
method. This approximation is derived by constraining the dynamics to a
manifold of low-rank functions via a tangent space projection and by splitting
this projection into the subprojections from which it is built. This reduces a
time step for the six- (or four-) dimensional Vlasov--Poisson equation to
solving two systems of three- (or two-) dimensional advection equations over
the time step, once in the position variables and once in the velocity
variables, where the size of each system of advection equations is equal to the
chosen rank. By a hierarchical dynamical low-rank approximation, a time step
for the Vlasov--Poisson equation can be further reduced to a set of six (or
four) systems of one-dimensional advection equations, where the size of each
system of advection equations is still equal to the rank. The resulting systems
of advection equations can then be solved by standard techniques such as
semi-Lagrangian or spectral methods. Numerical simulations in two and four
dimensions for linear Landau damping, for a two-stream instability and for a
plasma echo problem highlight the favorable behavior of this numerical method
and show that the proposed algorithm is able to drastically reduce the required
computational effort.

is (i) to assess whether approximate techniques can accurately predict the
behavior of laminated glass structures and (ii) to propose an easy tool for
modal analysis based on the enhanced effective thickness concept by Galuppi and
Royer-Carfagni.
  To this purpose, we consider four approaches to the solution of the related
nonlinear eigenvalue problem: a complex-eigenvalue solver based on the Newton
method, the modal strain energy method, and two effective thickness concepts. A
comparative study of free vibrating laminated glass beams is performed
considering different geometries of cross-sections, boundary conditions, and
material parameters for interlayers under two ambient temperatures. The
viscoelastic response of polymer foils is represented by the generalized
Maxwell model.
  We show that the simplified approaches predict natural frequencies with an
acceptable accuracy for most of the examples. However, there is a considerable
scatter in predicted loss factors. The enhanced effective thickness approach
adjusted for modal analysis leads to lower errors in both quantities compared
to the other two simplified procedures, reducing the extreme error in loss
factors to one half compared to the modal strain energy method or to one
quarter compared to the original dynamic effective thickness method.

determination of e.g. the unitarity triangle; hence the question to which

specifically given the long-standing tension between $V_{cb}$ determinations
from inclusive and exclusive decays and the significant hints for lepton
flavour universality violation in $b\to c\tau\nu$ and $b\to s\ell\ell$ decays.
We perform a comprehensive model-independent analysis of new physics in $b\to
c\ell\nu$, considering all combinations of scalar, vector and tensor
interactions occuring in single-mediator scenarios. We include for the first
time differential distributions of $B\to D^*\ell\nu$ angular observables for
this purpose. We show that these are valuable in constraining non-standard
interactions. Specifically, the zero-recoil endpoint of the $B\to D\ell\nu$
spectrum is extremely sensitive to scalar currents, while the maximum-recoil
endpoint of the $B\to D^*\ell\nu$ spectrum with transversely polarized $D^*$ is
extremely sensitive to tensor currents. We also quantify the room for $e$-$\mu$
universality violation in $b\to c\ell\nu$ transitions, predicted by some models
suggested to solve the $b\to c\tau\nu$ anomalies, from a global fit to $B\to
D\ell\nu$ and $B\to D^*\ell\nu$ for the first time. Specific new physics
models, corresponding to all possible tree-level mediators, are also discussed.
As a side effect, we present $V_{cb}$ determinations from exclusive $B$ decays,
both with frequentist and Bayesian statistics, leading to compatible results.
The entire numerical analysis is based on open source code, allowing it to be

important role in verification by enabling a clean separation of concerns
between software and hardware, verification of these ""accelerator-rich"" SoCs
presents new challenges. From the perspective of hardware designers, there is a
lack of a common framework for the formal functional specification of
accelerator behavior. From the perspective of software developers, there exists
no unified framework for reasoning about software/hardware interactions of
programs that interact with accelerators. This paper addresses these challenges
by providing a formal specification and high-level abstraction for accelerator
functional behavior. It formalizes the concept of an Instruction Level
Abstraction (ILA), developed informally in our previous work, and shows its
application in modeling and verification of accelerators. This formal ILA
extends the familiar notion of instructions to accelerators and provides a
uniform, modular, and hierarchical abstraction for modeling software-visible
behavior of both accelerators and programmable processors. We demonstrate the
applicability of the ILA through several case studies of accelerators (for
image processing, machine learning, and cryptography), and a general-purpose
processor (RISC-V). We show how the ILA model facilitates equivalence checking
between two ILAs, and between an ILA and its hardware finite-state machine
(FSM) implementation. Further, this equivalence checking supports accelerator
upgrades using the notion of ILA compatibility, similar to processor upgrades
using ISA compatibility.

Accompanying the Shapefinders, we also employ the 'largest cluster statistic'
(LCS), originally proposed in Klypin and Shandarin (1993), to study the
percolation in both neutral and ionized hydrogen. We find that the largest
ionized region is percolating below the neutral fraction $x_{HI} \lesssim
0.728$ (or equivalently $z \lesssim 9$). The study of Shapefinders reveals that
the largest ionized region starts to become highly filamentary with non-trivial
topology near the percolation transition. During the percolation transition,
the first two Shapefinders - 'thickness' ($T$) and 'breadth' ($B$) - of the
largest ionized region do not vary much, while the third Shapefinder - 'length'
($L$) - abruptly increases. Consequently, the largest ionized region tends to
be highly filamentary and topologically quite complex. The product of the first
two Shapefinders, $T\times B$, provides a measure of the 'cross-section' of a
filament-like ionized region. We find that, near percolation, the value of
$T\times B$ for the largest ionized region remains stable at $\sim 7$ Mpc$^2$

self-gravitating system near equilibrium evolves in phase space due to the
fluctuating gravitational field of the system. The characteristic timescale of
this process is called the relaxation time. In this paper, we highlight the
difference between two measures of the relaxation time in globular clusters:
(i) the diffusion time with which the isolating integrals of motion (i.e.
energy E and angular momentum magnitude L) of individual stars change
stochastically and (ii) the asymptotic timescale required for a family of
orbits to mix in the cluster. More specifically, the former corresponds to the
instantaneous rate of change of a star's E or L, while the latter corresponds
to the timescale for the stars to statistically forget their initial
conditions. We show that the diffusion timescales of E and L vary
systematically around the commonly used half-mass relaxation time in different
regions of the cluster by a factor of ~10 and ~100, respectively, for more than
20% of the stars. We define the mixedness of an orbital family at any given
time as the correlation coefficient between its E or L probability distribution
functions and those of the whole cluster. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we
find that mixedness converges asymptotically exponentially with a decay
timescale that is ~10 times the half-mass relaxation time.

$Z_2$ gauge theory on the square lattice: the topological state is
characterized by the expulsion of defects, carrying $Z_2$ magnetic flux. The
interplay between topological order and the breaking of global symmetry is
described by the non-zero temperature statistical mechanics of classical XY
models in dimension $D=3$; such models also describe the zero temperature
quantum phases of bosons with short-range interactions on the square lattice at
integer filling. The topological state is again characterized by the expulsion
of certain defects, in a state with fluctuating symmetry-breaking order, along
with the presence of emergent gauge fields. The phase diagrams of the $Z_2$
gauge theory and the XY models are obtained by embedding them in U(1) gauge
theories, and by studying their Higgs and confining phases. These ideas are
then applied to the single-band Hubbard model on the square lattice. A SU(2)
gauge theory describes the fluctuations of spin-density-wave order, and its
phase diagram is presented by analogy to the XY models. We obtain a class of
zero temperature metallic states with fluctuating spin-density wave order,
topological order associated with defect expulsion, deconfined emergent gauge
fields, reconstructed Fermi surfaces (with `chargon' or electron-like
quasiparticles), but no broken symmetry. We conclude with the application of
such metallic states to the pseudogap phase of the cuprates, and note the
recent comparison with numerical studies of the Hubbard model and photoemission
observations of the electron-doped cuprates. In a detour, we also discuss the
influence of Berry phases, and how they can lead to deconfined quantum critical
points: this applies to bosons on the square lattice at half-integer filling,
and to quantum dimer models.

calculations that follow the collapse of rotating, magnetised, molecular cloud

all three non-ideal effects: ambipolar diffusion, Ohmic resistivity and the
Hall effect. We employ an ionisation model in which cosmic ray ionisation
dominates at low temperatures and thermal ionisation takes over at high
temperatures. We explore the effects of varying the cosmic ray ionisation rate
from $\zeta_\text{cr}= 10^{-10}$ to $10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$. Models with ionisation
rates $\gtrsim 10^{-12}$ s$^{-1}$ produce results that are indistinguishable
from ideal MHD. Decreasing the cosmic ray ionisation rate extends the lifetime
of the first hydrostatic core up to a factor of two, but the lifetimes are
still substantially shorter than those obtained without magnetic fields.
Outflows from the first hydrostatic core phase are launched in all models, but
the outflows become broader and slower as the ionisation rate is reduced. The
outflow morphology following stellar core formation is complex and strongly
dependent on the cosmic ray ionisation rate. Calculations with high ionisation
rates quickly produce a fast (~14km s$^{-1}$) bipolar outflow that is distinct
from the first core outflow, but with the lowest ionisation rate a slower (~3-4
km s$^{-1}$) conical outflow develops gradually and seamlessly merges into the
first core outflow.

coupled to a parametric dust attenuation law, we constrain Rv and B, as well as
the colour excess, E(B-V). We find a correlation between Rv and B, that can be
interpreted either as a result of the grain size distribution, or a variation
of the dust geometry among galaxies. According to the former, small dust grains
are associated with a stronger NUV bump. The latter would lead to a range of
clumpiness in the distribution of dust within the interstellar medium of
star-forming galaxies. The observed wide range of NUV bump strengths can lead
to a systematic in the interpretation of the UV slope ($\beta$) typically used

the corresponding links. We first review the case of $U(1)$ Chern-Simons theory
where these are stabilizer states, a fact we use to re-derive an explicit
formula for the entanglement entropy across a general link bipartition. We then
present the following results for $SU(2)$ Chern-Simons theory: (i) The
entanglement entropy for a bipartition of a link gives a lower bound on the
genus of surfaces in the ambient $S^3$ separating the two sublinks. (ii) All
torus links (namely, links which can be drawn on the surface of a torus) have a
GHZ-like entanglement structure -- i.e., partial traces leave a separable
state. By contrast, through explicit computation, we test in many examples that
hyperbolic links (namely, links whose complements admit hyperbolic structures)
have W-like entanglement -- i.e., partial traces leave a non-separable state.
(iii) Finally, we consider hyperbolic links in the complexified $SL(2,C)$
Chern-Simons theory, which is closely related to 3d Einstein gravity with a
negative cosmological constant. In the limit of small Newton constant, we
discuss how the entanglement structure is controlled by the Neumann-Zagier

alkaline-earth atoms in an optical lattice. The new feature of our setup is
Floquet engineering of interactions using time-dependent Zeeman shifts, that
can be realized either using state-dependent optical Stark shifts or magnetic
fields. The properties of the resulting Kondo model strongly depend on the
anisotropy of the ferromagnetic interactions. In particular, easy-plane
couplings give rise to Kondo singlet formation even though microscopic
interactions are all ferromagnetic. We discuss both equilibrium and dynamical
properties of the system that can be measured with ultracold atoms, including
the impurity spin susceptibility, the impurity spin relaxation rate, as well as
the equilibrium and dynamical spin correlations between the impurity and the
ferromagnetic bath atoms. We analyze the non-equilibrium time evolution of the
system using a variational non-Gaussian approach, which allows us to explore
coherent dynamics over both short and long timescales, as set by the bandwidth
and the Kondo singlet formation, respectively. In the quench-type experiments,
when the Kondo interaction is suddenly switched on, we find that real-time
dynamics shows crossovers reminiscent of poor man's renormalization group flow
used to describe equilibrium systems. For bare easy-plane ferromagnetic
couplings, this allows us to follow the formation of the Kondo screening cloud
as the dynamics crosses over from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic behavior.
On the other side of the phase diagram, our scheme makes it possible to measure
quantum corrections to the well-known Korringa law describing the temperature
dependence of the impurity spin relaxation rate. Theoretical results discussed
in our paper can be measured using currently available experimental techniques.

illustrate an important bias present in previous $L$-$Z$ and $M_{*}$-$Z$

systematically lower slopes in these relations. Our KISS FMR shows consistency
with those found in the literature, albeit with a larger scatter. This is

spectator-spectator interactions. While it is known that these interactions
cancel in inclusive cross sections, like for the Drell-Yan process, not much is
known about for what classes of observables factorization is violated. We show
that for pure Glauber ladder graphs, all amplitude-level factorization
violating effects completely cancel at cross section level for any single-scale
observable (such as hadronic transverse energy or beam thrust). This result
disproves previous claims that these pure Glauber graphs are
factorization-violating. Our proof exploits scale invariance of two-to-two
scattering amplitudes in an essential way. The leading factorization-violating
effects therefore come from graphs with at least one soft gluon, involving the
Lipatov vertex off of the Glauber ladders. This implies that real soft
radiation must be involved in factorization-violation, shedding light on the
connection between factorization-violation and the underlying event.

packets are the prototypes of the renowned discovery, which are familiar as
coherent states today. Coherent states are inevitable in the study of almost
all areas of modern science, and the rate of progress of the subject is
astonishing nowadays. Nonclassical states constitute one of the distinguished
branches of coherent states having applications in various subjects including
quantum information processing, quantum optics, quantum superselection
principles and mathematical physics. On the other hand, the compelling
advancements of non-Hermitian systems and related areas have been appealing,
which became popular with the seminal paper by Bender and Boettcher in 1998.
The subject of non-Hermitian Hamiltonian systems possessing real eigenvalues
are exploding day by day and combining with almost all other subjects rapidly,
in particular, in the areas of quantum optics, lasers and condensed matter
systems, where one finds ample successful experiments for the proposed theory.
For this reason, the study of coherent states for non-Hermitian systems have
been very important. In this article, we review the recent developments of
coherent and nonclassical states for such systems and discuss their
applications and usefulness in different contexts of physics. In addition,
since the systems considered here originate from the broader context of the
study of minimal uncertainty relations, our review is also of interest to the
mathematical physics community.

enhance the detectability of planets, in the absence of transits or a
coronagraph, significantly expanding the accessible discovery and
characterization space. Flares produce brief bursts of intense luminosity,
after which the star dims. Due to the light travel time between the star and

scattering (a light echo) or intrinsic emission when the star is much fainter,
thereby increasing the planet's detectability. The planet's light echo emission
can potentially be discriminated from that of the host star by means of a time
delay, Doppler shift, spatial shift, and polarization, each of which can
improve the contrast of the planet to the star. Scattered light can reveal the
albedo spectrum of the planet to within a size scale factor, and is likely to
be polarized. Intrinsic emission mechanisms include fluorescent pumping of
multiple molecular hydrogen and neutral oxygen lines by intense LyAlpha and

entanglement entropy for the Maxwell theory of a $U(1)$ gauge field in (3+1)
dimensions has been the subject of controversy. It is generally accepted that
the ground state entanglement entropy for a region of linear size $L$ behaves
as an area law with a subleading logarithm, $S = \alpha L^2 -\gamma \log L$.
While the logarithmic coefficient $\gamma$ is believed to be universal, there
has been disagreement about its precise value. After carefully accounting for
subtle boundary corrections, multiple analyses in the high energy literature
have converged on an answer related to the conformal trace anomaly, which is
only sensitive to the local curvature of the partition. In contrast, a
condensed matter treatment of the problem yielded a topological contribution
which is not captured by the conformal field theory calculation. In this
perspective piece, we review aspects of the various calculations and discuss
the resolution of the discrepancy, emphasizing the important role played by
charged states (the ""extended Hilbert space"") in defining entanglement for a
gauge theory. While the trace anomaly result is sufficient for a strictly pure
gauge field, coupling the gauge field to dynamical charges of mass $m$ gives a
topological contribution to $\gamma$ which survives even in the
$m\rightarrow\infty$ limit. For many situations, the topological contribution
from dynamical charges is physically meaningful and should be taken into
account. We also comment on other common issues of entanglement in gauge
theories, such as entanglement distillation, algebraic definitions of
entanglement, and gauge-fixing procedures.

The stiffness has been attributed to a complex interplay between four basic
elements - smooth bends, sharp folds, localized points (developable cones), and
stretching ridges - yet rigorous models of the structure are not yet available.
In this letter we show that adhesion, the attraction between surfaces within
the crumpled structure, is an important yet overlooked contributer to the
overall strength of a crumpled film. Specifically, we conduct experiments with
two different polymers films and compare the role of plastic deformation,
elastic deformation and adhesion in crumpling. We use an empirical model to
capture the behaviour quantitatively, and use the model to show that adhesion
leads to an order of magnitude increase in ""effective"" modulus. Going beyond
statics, we additionally conduct force recovery experiments. We show that once
adhesion is accounted for, plastic and elastic crumpled films recover
logarithmically. The time constants measured through crumpling, interpreted
with our model, show an identical distribution as do the base materials
measured in more conventional geometries.

them with long-term observations by Swift. We studied the temporal and spectral
behavior of the source, and its short- and long-term evolution. We constructed
a simple toy-model to gain insight into the complex emission pattern of SMC
X-3. We confirm the pulse period of the system, derived by previous works and
note that the pulse has a complex, three peaked shape. We find that the pulsed
emission is dominated by hard photons, while at energies below ~1 keV, the
emission is virtually non-pulsating. We further find that the shape of the
pulse profile and the short and long-term evolution of the source light-curve
can be explained by invoking a combination of a ""fan"" and a ""polar"" beam. Our
spectroscopic analysis, reveals a two-component emission: a hard power law and
a soft thermal component. We find that the latter produces the bulk of the
non-pulsating emission and is most likely the result of reprocessing of the
primary hard emission, by optically thick material that partially obscures the
central source. We also detect strong emission lines from highly ionized
metals. The strength of the emission lines are strongly phase-depended. The
energy and temporal evolution and the shape of the pulse profile and the
long-term spectra evolution of the source are consistent with the expected
emission pattern of the accretion column in the super-critical regime, while
the presence of a large reprocessing region is consistent with the analysis of
previously studied X-ray pulsars observed at high accretion rates. The presence
of this region is consistent with recently proposed works that suggest that
high-B NSs occupy a considerable fraction of ULXs.

is characterized by the frequency $\omega_c\!\sim \!c/2a_c$ at which the
in-planar polarizabilities along the two principal axes are equal. The two
materials seek to align their principal axes of polarizabilities in one
direction below $a_c$, while above $a_c$ their axes try to align rotated
perpendicular relative to their previous minimum energy orientation. The
sign-reversal disappears in the nonretarded limit. Our perturbative result,
derived for the case when the differences in the relative polarizabilities are

for co-simulation of CoTDS are proposed using parallel and series computation
of the transmission system and distribution systems. Both these co-simulation
methods are validated against total system simulation in a single time-domain

have better numerical stability at larger integration time steps. The series

$\mathrm{d}s^2=\mathrm{d}x^2\pm\mathrm{d}y^2$. The investigation is based on
previous results in the simply isotropic space [B. Pavkovi\'c, Glas. Mat. Ser.

point to the possibility of introducing an isotropic Gauss map taking values on
a unit sphere of parabolic type and of defining a shape operator from it, whose
determinant and trace give the known relative Gaussian and mean curvatures,
respectively. Based on the isotropic Gauss map, a new notion of connection is
also introduced, the \emph{relative connection} (\emph{r-connection}, for
short). We show that the new curvature tensor in both $\mathbb{I}^3$ and
$\mathbb{I}_{\mathrm{p}}^3$ does not vanish identically and is directly related
to the relative Gaussian curvature. We also compute the Gauss and
Codazzi-Mainardi equations for the $r$-connection and show that $r$-geodesics
on spheres of parabolic type are obtained via intersections with planes passing
through their center (focus). Finally, we show that admissible pseudo-isotropic
surfaces are timelike and that their shape operator may fail to be
diagonalizable, in analogy to Lorentzian geometry. We also prove that the only
totally umbilical surfaces in $\mathbb{I}_{\mathrm{p}}^3$ are planes and
spheres of parabolic type and that, in contrast to the $r$-connection, the
curvature tensor associated with the isotropic Levi-Civita connection vanishes
identically for $any$ pseudo-isotropic surface, as also happens in simply

produced by the processes of spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) and
spontaneous four wave mixing (SFWM) is crucial for guaranteeing the usability
of heralded single photons and polarization-entangled pairs for multi-photon
protocols. In this paper, we compare six different techniques that yield either
a characterization of the joint spectral intensity or of the closely-related
purity of heralded single photons. These six techniques include: i) scanning
monochromator measurements, ii) a variant of Fourier transform spectroscopy
designed to extract the desired information exploiting a resource-optimized
technique, iii) dispersive fibre spectroscopy, iv) stimulated-emission-based
measurement, v) measurement of the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}$
for one of the two photons, and vi) two-source Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry.
We discuss the relative performance of these techniques for the specific cases
of a SPDC source designed to be factorable and SFWM sources of varying purity,
and compare the techniques' relative advantages and disadvantages.

a coherence time exceeding a second for a single electron spin through
decoupling sequences tailored to its microscopic nuclear-spin environment. We
first use the electron spin to probe the environment, which is accurately

develop initialization, control and readout of the carbon-13 pairs in order to
directly reveal their atomic structure. We then exploit this knowledge to store
quantum states for over a second by carefully avoiding unwanted interactions.

to users in authentication applications. However, in the negative recognition
scenario where users may intentionally distort their fingerprints, this can be
a serious problem since distortion will prevent recognition system from
identifying malicious users. Current methods aimed at addressing this problem
still have limitations. They are often not accurate because they estimate
distortion parameters based on the ridge frequency map and orientation map of
input samples, which are not reliable due to distortion. Secondly, they are not
efficient and requiring significant computation time to rectify samples. In
this paper, we develop a rectification model based on a Deep Convolutional
Neural Network (DCNN) to accurately estimate distortion parameters from the
input image. Using a comprehensive database of synthetic distorted samples, the
DCNN learns to accurately estimate distortion bases ten times faster than the
dictionary search methods used in the previous approaches. Evaluating the
proposed method on public databases of distorted samples shows that it can
significantly improve the matching performance of distorted samples.

performance. For example, if the destination of a branch depends on a memory
value that is in the process of being read, CPUs will try guess the destination
and attempt to execute ahead. When the memory value finally arrives, the CPU
either discards or commits the speculative computation. Speculative logic is
unfaithful in how it executes, can access to the victim's memory and registers,
and can perform operations with measurable side effects.
  Spectre attacks involve inducing a victim to speculatively perform operations
that would not occur during correct program execution and which leak the
victim's confidential information via a side channel to the adversary. This
paper describes practical attacks that combine methodology from side channel
attacks, fault attacks, and return-oriented programming that can read arbitrary
memory from the victim's process. More broadly, the paper shows that
speculative execution implementations violate the security assumptions
underpinning numerous software security mechanisms, including operating system
process separation, static analysis, containerization, just-in-time (JIT)
compilation, and countermeasures to cache timing/side-channel attacks. These
attacks represent a serious threat to actual systems, since vulnerable
speculative execution capabilities are found in microprocessors from Intel,
AMD, and ARM that are used in billions of devices.
  While makeshift processor-specific countermeasures are possible in some
cases, sound solutions will require fixes to processor designs as well as
updates to instruction set architectures (ISAs) to give hardware architects and
software developers a common understanding as to what computation state CPU
implementations are (and are not) permitted to leak.

the existence of weak hybridization between the f electrons and conduction
electrons. The hybridization is further confirmed by the formation of the
hybridization gap revealed by temperature-dependent scanning tunneling

butterfly morphology. We present here deep high-resolution broad- and
narrow-band optical images that expose the rich and intricate fine structure of
this bipolar PN, with small-scale bubble-like features and collimated outflows.
A SHAPE spatio-kinematical model indicates that NGC650-1 has a broad central
torus with an inclination angle of 75 degrees with respect to the line of
sight, whereas that of the bipolar lobes, which are clearly seen in the
position-velocity maps, is 85 degrees. Large field of view deep images show,
for first time, an arc-like diffuse envelope in low- and high-excitation
emission lines located up to 180 arcsec towards the East-Southeast of the
central star, well outside the main nebula. This morphological component is
confirmed by Spitzer MIPS and WISE infrared imaging, as well as by long-slit
low- and high-dispersion optical spectroscopic observations. HST images of
NGC650-1 obtained at two different epochs (14 yrs apart), reveal the proper
motion of the central star along this direction. We propose that this motion of
the star through the interstellar medium compresses the remnant material of a
slow Asymptotic Giant Branch wind, producing this bow-shock-like feature.

simplifying assumptions. First, they assume that observations made from
different heights are deterministically correct. In practice, observations are
noisy, with the noise increasing as the height used for observations increases.
Second, they assume that a motion command executes correctly, which may not
happen due to wind and other environmental factors. To address these, we
propose a sequential algorithm that determines actions in real time based on
observations, using partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs).
Our formulation handles both observations and motion uncertainty and errors. We
run offline simulations and learn a policy. This policy is run on a UAV to find

with mixed tetragonal phase. By increasing the thickness of Ru layer, the
tetragonal phase gradually disappears and a relatively pure hexagonal phase is
obtained in the Ta(5)/Ru(30) buffered sample. Further magnetic and transport
measurements revealed that the anomalous Hall conductivity nearly vanishes in
the pure hexagonal sample, while an abnormal asymmetric hump structure emerges
in the low field region. The extracted additional Hall term is robust in a
large temperature range and presents a sign reversal above 200K. The abnormal
Hall properties are proposed to be closely related with the frustrated spin
structure of D019 Mn3Ga.

with remarkable elasticity. For such an impact, the balance between the
inertial and capillary forces ascertain the contact time. This is found to be
fairly constant for any macroscopically flat SHS and for a given drop volume.
Recently, various studies have shown that breaking the radial symmetry during
the drop impact can significantly reduce the contact time below that of a flat
SHS. One such study has been performed on a cylindrical SHS with a curvature
comparable to the drop. The reduction in contact time has been attributed to
the radially anisotropic flow imparted by the tangential component of momentum
and the elliptical footprint of the drop during the crash. Here, we perform
drop impact experiments on bathtub-like SHS and show that the radial anisotropy
can be triggered even in the absence of both the criteria mentioned above. This
is shown to be a consequence of the lamella deflection during the spreading of
the drop. The reduction in contact time is quite clearly evident in this
experimental regime.

(CABC) system in which the reader recovers information not only from the A-BD,
but also from the RF source. We first establish the system model for the CABC
system from spread spectrum and spectrum sharing perspectives. Then, for flat
fading channels, we derive the optimal maximum-likelihood (ML) detector,
suboptimal linear detectors as well as successive interference-cancellation
(SIC) based detectors. For frequency-selective fading channels, the system
model for the CABC system over ambient orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) carriers is proposed, upon which a low-complexity optimal
ML detector is derived. For both kinds of channels, the bit-error-rate (BER)
expressions for the proposed detectors are derived in closed forms. Finally,
extensive numerical results have shown that, when the A-BD signal and the
RF-source signal have equal symbol period, the proposed SIC-based detectors can
achieve near-ML detection performance for typical application scenarios, and
when the A-BD symbol period is longer than the RF-source symbol period, the
existence of backscattered signal in the CABC system can enhance the ML
detection performance of the RF-source signal, thanks to the beneficial effect
of the backscatter link when the A-BD transmits at a lower rate than the RF
source.

calculations predict that the super- fluidity enhances the fluctuations of the

experimentally. Purpose: The goal of this study is to investigate empirically
the effect of the superfluidity on the fusion barrier width. Method: First, the
local regression method is introduce and used to determine the barrier
distribution more precisely. A second method that requires only the calculation
of an integral of the cross section is developed to determine accurately the
fluctuations of the barrier. A benchmark is done between this two methods and
with the fitting method usually used. This integral method showing a better
agreement in a test case, it is applied systematically in a selection of 115
fusion reactions. Results: The fluctuations of the barrier for superfluid
systems are on average larger than for magic or semi-magic nuclei. This is due
to the deformation effects and the effect of the superfluidity. To disentangle
those two effects, we compare the experimental width to the width estimated
from a model that takes into account the tunneling, the deformation and the
vibration effect. The deviation of the experimental width from this theory for
reaction between superfluid nuclei shows that the superfluidity enhance the
fusion barrier width. Conclusions: This analysis shows that the predicted
effect of the superfluidity on the width of the barrier is real and is of the
order of 1 MeV.

the proposed method is particularly suitable for problems defined on non-smooth

high-frequency component is not trivial. In this study, a one-dimensional
numerical simulation is performed to demonstrate that the observed spicule
oscillations originate from longitudinal-to-transverse mode conversion that
occurs around the equipartition layer in the chromosphere. Calculations are
conducted in a self-consistent manner with the exception of additional heating
to maintain coronal temperature. The analyses indicate the following features:
(1) mode conversion efficiently excites high-frequency transverse waves; (2)
the typical period of the high-frequency waves corresponds to the
sound-crossing time of the mode conversion region; and (3) simulated
root-mean-square velocity of the high-frequency component is consistent with
the observed value. These results indicate that the observation of spicule
oscillation provides direct evidence of mode conversion in the chromosphere.

lensed images seen in different energy bands or in gravitational waves (GWs)

depends on the timing accuracy of cosmic transient and the strong lensing time
delay. If the time delay of cosmic transient can be measured with accuracy
about 0.1 s (e.g. gamma-ray bursts), we show that the upper limit on the
differences of the parameterized post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma$ value is
$\Delta \gamma<10^{-7}$ with a one-month strong lensing time delay event. This
accuracy of WEP can be improved by a factor of $10^{7}$, if the lens is galaxy

applications in many important scenarios. Mainstream fashion parsing models
focus on parsing the high-resolution and clean images. However, directly
applying the parsers trained on benchmarks to a particular application scenario
in the wild, e.g., a canteen, airport or workplace, often gives
non-satisfactory performance due to domain shift. In this paper, we explore a
new and challenging cross-domain human parsing problem: taking the benchmark
dataset with extensive pixel-wise labeling as the source domain, how to obtain
a satisfactory parser on a new target domain without requiring any additional
manual labeling? To this end, we propose a novel and efficient cross-domain
human parsing model to bridge the cross-domain differences in terms of visual
appearance and environment conditions and fully exploit commonalities across
domains. Our proposed model explicitly learns a feature compensation network,
which is specialized for mitigating the cross-domain differences. A
discriminative feature adversarial network is introduced to supervise the
feature compensation to effectively reduce the discrepancy between feature
distributions of two domains. Besides, our model also introduces a structured
label adversarial network to guide the parsing results of the target domain to
follow the high-order relationships of the structured labels shared across
domains. The proposed framework is end-to-end trainable, practical and scalable
in real applications. Extensive experiments are conducted where LIP dataset is
the source domain and 4 different datasets including surveillance videos,
movies and runway shows are evaluated as target domains. The results
consistently confirm data efficiency and performance advantages of the proposed
method for the cross-domain human parsing problem.

specifically Fe, Ca, Si, Mg, S, Ar, and Ni, when there is sufficiently high

conduct meta-analysis for pooling studies, one needs to first estimate the
sample mean and standard deviation from the five number summary. A number of
studies have been proposed in the recent literature to solve this problem.
However, none of the existing estimators for the standard deviation is
satisfactory for practical use. After a brief review of the existing
literature, we point out that Wan et al.'s method (BMC Med Res Methodol 14:135,
2014) has a serious limitation in estimating the standard deviation from the
five number summary. To improve it, we propose a smoothly weighted estimator by
incorporating the sample size information and derive the optimal weight for the
new estimator. For ease of implementation, we also provide an approximation
formula of the optimal weight and a shortcut formula for estimating the
standard deviation from the five number summary. The performance of the
proposed estimator is evaluated through two simulation studies. In comparison
with Wan et al.'s estimator, our new estimator provides a more accurate
estimate for normal data and performs favorably for non-normal data. In real
data analysis, our new method is also able to provide a more accurate estimate
of the true sample standard deviation than the existing method. In this paper,
we propose an optimal estimator of the standard deviation from the five number
summary. Together with the optimal mean estimator in Luo et al. (Stat Methods

velocities for MoSSe than $\mathrm{MoSe_2}$ monolayer is main reason of higher
$\kappa_L$. The elastic properties of $\mathrm{MoS_2}$, MoSSe and
$\mathrm{MoSe_2}$ monolayers are also calculated, and the order of Young's
modulus is identical with that of $\kappa_L$. Calculated results show that
isotope scattering leads to 5.8\% reduce of $\kappa_L$. The size effects on the
$\kappa_L$ are also considered, which is usually used in the device
implementation. When the characteristic length of MoSSe monolayer is about 110
nm, the $\kappa_L$ reduces to half. These results may offer perspectives on
thermal management of MoSSe monolayer for applications of thermoelectrics,
thermal circuits and nanoelectronics, and motivate further theoretical or
experimental efforts to investigate thermal transports of Janus TMD monolayers.

  Triaging",,,,,"cs.SE cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For a given software bug report, identifying an appropriate developer who
could potentially fix the bug is the primary task of a bug triaging process. A
bug title (summary) and a detailed description is present in most of the bug
tracking systems. Automatic bug triaging algorithm can be formulated as a
classification problem, with the bug title and description as the input,
mapping it to one of the available developers (classes). The major challenge is
that the bug description usually contains a combination of free unstructured
text, code snippets, and stack trace making the input data noisy. The existing
bag-of-words (BOW) feature models do not consider the syntactical and
sequential word information available in the unstructured text. We propose a
novel bug report representation algorithm using an attention based deep
bidirectional recurrent neural network (DBRNN-A) model that learns a syntactic
and semantic feature from long word sequences in an unsupervised manner.
Instead of BOW features, the DBRNN-A based bug representation is then used for
training the classifier. Using an attention mechanism enables the model to
learn the context representation over a long word sequence, as in a bug report.
To provide a large amount of data to learn the feature learning model, the
unfixed bug reports (~70% bugs in an open source bug tracking system) are
leveraged, which were completely ignored in the previous studies. Another
contribution is to make this research reproducible by making the source code
available and creating a public benchmark dataset of bug reports from three
open source bug tracking system: Google Chromium (383,104 bug reports), Mozilla
Core (314,388 bug reports), and Mozilla Firefox (162,307 bug reports).
Experimentally we compare our approach with BOW model and machine learning
approaches and observe that DBRNN-A provides a higher rank-10 average accuracy.

radioactivity has gained renewed attention over the past fifteen years. The
$^6$Be system is the lightest two-proton ground-state emitter, while $^{16}$Be
has been recently proposed to be the first two-neutron ground-state emitter
ever observed. A proper understanding of their properties and decay modes
requires a reasonable description of the three-body continuum.
  Purpose: Study the ground-state properties of $^6$Be and $^{16}$Be within a
general three-body model and investigate their nucleon-nucleon correlations in
the continuum.
  Method: The pseudostate (PS) method in hyperspherical coordinates, using the
analytical transformed harmonic oscillator (THO) basis for three-body systems,
is used to construct the $^6$Be and $^{16}$Be ground-state wave functions.
These resonances are approximated as a stable PS around the known two-nucleon
separation energy. Effective core-$N$ potentials, constrained by the available
experimental information on the binary subsystems $^5$Li and $^{15}$Be, are
employed in the calculations.
  Results: The ground state of $^{16}$Be is found to present a strong dineutron
configuration, with the valence neutrons occupying mostly an $l=2$ state
relative to the core. The results are consistent with previous $R$-matrix
calculations for the actual continuum. The case of $^6$Be shows a clear
symmetry with respect to its mirror partner, the two-neutron halo $^6$He: The
diproton configuration is dominant, and the valence protons occupy an $l=1$
orbit.
  Conclusions: The PS method is found to be a suitable tool in describing the
properties of unbound $\text{core}+N+N$ ground states. For both $^{16}$Be and
$^6$Be, the results are consistent with previous theoretical studies and
confirm the dominant dinucleon configuration. This favors the picture of a
correlated two-nucleon emission.

critical challenge. Given the large variability of household waste, current
recycling platforms mostly rely on human operators to analyze the scene,
typically composed of many object instances piled up in bulk. Helping them by
robotizing the unitary extraction is a key challenge to speed up this tedious
process. Whereas supervised deep learning has proven very efficient for such
object-level scene understanding, e.g., generic object detection and
segmentation in everyday scenes, it however requires large sets of per-pixel
labeled images, that are hardly available for numerous application contexts,
including industrial robotics. We thus propose a step towards a practical
interactive application for generating an object-oriented robotic grasp,
requiring as inputs only one depth map of the scene and one user click on the
next object to extract. More precisely, we address in this paper the middle
issue of object seg-mentation in top views of piles of bulk objects given a
pixel location, namely seed, provided interactively by a human operator. We
propose a twofold framework for generating edge-driven instance segments.
First, we repurpose a state-of-the-art fully convolutional object contour
detector for seed-based instance segmentation by introducing the notion of
edge-mask duality with a novel patch-free and contour-oriented loss function.
Second, we train one model using only synthetic scenes, instead of manually
labeled training data. Our experimental results show that considering edge-mask
duality for training an encoder-decoder network, as we suggest, outperforms a
state-of-the-art patch-based network in the present application context.

controlled to form reconstruction on the film surface. To suppress the chemical
diffusion across the interface, the growth is interrupted between each unit
cell layer to allow the lattice relaxation at a lowered temperature. In this
way, high quality two-dimensional growth is realized and the heterointerfaces
exhibit sharpness at the atomic scale. Our work provides a path to precisely

maximize expected reward while also maximizing entropy. That is, to succeed at

relativistic (GR), three-dimensional (3D) simulation with three-flavor
multi-energy neutrino transport. Utilizing a 70 solar mass zero metallicity
progenitor, we self-consistently follow the radiation-hydrodynamics from the
onset of gravitational core-collapse until the second collapse of the
proto-neutron star (PNS), leading to black hole (BH) formation. Our results
show that the BH formation occurs at a post-bounce time of ~300 ms for the 70
Msun star. This is significantly earlier than those in the literature where
lower mass progenitors were employed. At a few ~10 ms before BH formation, we
find that the stalled bounce shock is revived by intense neutrino heating from
the very hot PNS, which is aided by violent convection behind the shock. In the
context of 3D-GR core-collapse modeling with multi-energy neutrino transport,
our numerical results present the first evidence to validate a fallback BH
formation scenario of the 70 Msun star.

connected with the propagator of the cycle being non-compact. For a working
fluid consisting of quantum harmonic oscillators, the transition point in
parameter space where this instability occurs is associated with a
non-hermitian degeneracy (exceptional point) of the eigenvalues of the
propagator. In particular, a third-order exceptional point is observed at the
transition from the region where the eigenvalues are complex numbers to the
region where all the eigenvalues are real. Within this region we find another
exceptional point, this time of second order, at which the trajectory becomes
divergent. The onset of the divergent behavior corresponds to the modulus of
one of the eigenvalues becoming larger than one. The physical origin of this
phenomenon is that the hot and cold heat baths are unable to dissipate the
frictional internal heat generated in the adiabatic strokes of the cycle. This
behavior is contrasted with that of quantum spins as working fluid which have a
compact Hamiltonian and thus no exceptional points. All arguments are
rigorously proved in terms of the systems' associated Lie algebras.

is required. Established NQR probeheads with motor-driven tune-match stages are
usually bulky and slow, which can be prohibitive if it comes to Bi compounds
with low SNR (excessive averaging) and long quadrupolar T1 times. Moreover many
experiments yield better results at low temperatures such as 77K (liquid

present electronically tuned wideband probeheads for bands in the frequency
range 20 - 120 MHz which can be immersed in LN and which enable very fast
explorative scans over the whole range. To this end we apply an interleaved
subspectrum sampling strategy (ISS) which relies on the electronic tuning

experimental scan of triphenylbismuth from 24-116 MHz both at room temperature

instantaneous feedback. We call them lazy restless bandits (LRB) as the events
of decision-making are sparser than events of state transition. Hence, feedback
after each decision event is the cumulative effect of the following state
transition events. The states of arms are hidden from the decision-maker and
rewards for actions are state dependent. The decision-maker needs to choose one
arm in each decision interval, such that long term cumulative reward is
maximized.
  As the states are hidden, the decision-maker maintains and updates its belief
about them. It is shown that LRBs admit an optimal policy which has threshold
structure in belief space. The Whittle-index policy for solving LRB problem is
analyzed; indexability of LRBs is shown. Further, closed-form index expressions

This ability to push through the crowd is associated with the slope of
individual linear model of the dependency of the travel time on the number of

such ability is carried out by means of the route choice, i.e. strategy whether
to bypass the crowd or to walk directly through it. The study has revealed that

resulted in a sample of 11 very metal-poor stars, from [Fe/H]=-2.5 to
[Fe/H]=-3.4, and one carbon-rich star, CS 22949-037 with [Fe/H]=-4.0. The
abundances were compared to those observed in two classical metal-poor stars:
the typical r-rich star CS 31082-001 ([Eu/Fe] > +1.0) and the r-poor star HD
122563 ([Eu/Fe] < 0.0), which are known to present a strong enrichment of the
first peak neutron-capture elements relative to the second peak. Within the
first peak, the abundances are well correlated in analogy to the well-known
correlation inside the abundances of the second-peak elements. In contrast,
there is no correlation between any first peak element with any second peak
element. We show that the scatter of the ratio of the first peak abundance over
second peak abundance increases when the mean abundance of the second peak
elements decreases from r-rich to r-poor stars. We found two new r-poor stars
that are very similar to HD 122563. A third r-poor star, CS 22897-008, is even
more extreme; this star shows the most extreme example of first peak elements
enrichment to date. On the contrary, another r-poor star (BD-18 5550) has a
pattern of first peak elements that is similar to the typical r-rich stars CS
31082-001, however this star has some Mo enrichment. The distribution of the
neutron-capture elements in our very metal-poor stars can be understood as the
combination of at least two mechanisms: one that enriches the forming stars
cloud homogeneously through the main r-process and leads to an element pattern
similar to the r-rich stars, such as CS 31082-001; and another that forms
mainly lighter, first peak elements.

transportation is the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) raster scans
and imaging observations in near-ultraviolet (NUV) and far-ultraviolet (FUV)
emission channels with high time-spatial resolutions. In this study, we focus
on the quiet Sun as observed with IRIS. The data with high signal to noise
ratio in Si IV, C II and Mg II k lines and with strong emission intensities
show a high correlation in TR bright network points. The results of the IRIS
intensity maps and dopplergrams are compared with those of Atmo- spheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA) and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instruments
onboard the Solar Dynamical Observatory (SDO). The average network intensity
profiles show a strong correlation with AIA coronal channels. Furthermore, we
applied simultaneous observations of magnetic network from HMI and found a
strong relationship between the network bright points in all levels of the
solar atmosphere. These features in network elements exhibited high doppler
velocity regions and large mag- netic signatures. A dominative fraction of
corona bright points emission, accompanied by the magnetic origins in
photosphere, suggest that magnetic-field concentrations in the network rosettes

measurement of cosmogenic isotopes stored in terrestrial reservoirs like trees
($^{14}$C) and ice cores ($^{10}$Be). The various reconstructions of $B_{\rm
HMF}$ are however discordant both in strength and trend. Cosmogenic isotopes,
which are produced by galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) impacting on meteoroids and
whose production rate is modulated by the varying HMF convected outward by the
solar wind, may offer an alternative tool for the investigation of the HMF in
the past centuries. In this work, we aim to evaluate the long-term evolution of
$B_{\rm HMF}$ over a period covering the past twenty-two solar cycles by using
measurements of the cosmogenic $^{44}$Ti activity ($\tau_{1/2} = 59.2 \pm 0.6$
yr) measured in 20 meteorites which fell between 1766 and 2001. Within the
given uncertainties, our result is compatible with a HMF increase from
$4.87^{+0.24}_{-0.30}$ nT in 1766 to $6.83^{+0.13}_{-0.11}$ nT in 2001, thus
implying an overall average increment of $1.96^{+0.43}_{-0.35}$ nT over 235
years since 1766 reflecting the modern Grand maximum. The $B_{\rm HMF}$ trend
thus obtained is then compared with the most recent reconstructions of the
near-Earth heliospheric magnetic field strength based on geomagnetic, sunspot
number and cosmogenic isotope data.

methods that depend on bounding box regression and perform at least two kinds

Regression plays a key role in the acquisition of bounding boxes in these
methods, but it is not indispensable because text/non-text prediction can also
be considered as a kind of semantic segmentation that contains full location
information in itself. However, text instances in scene images often lie very
close to each other, making them very difficult to separate via semantic
segmentation. Therefore, instance segmentation is needed to address this
problem. In this paper, PixelLink, a novel scene text detection algorithm based
on instance segmentation, is proposed. Text instances are first segmented out
by linking pixels within the same instance together. Text bounding boxes are
then extracted directly from the segmentation result without location
regression. Experiments show that, compared with regression-based methods,
PixelLink can achieve better or comparable performance on several benchmarks,
while requiring many fewer training iterations and less training data.

is a differential equation describing time evolution of the distribution
function of plasma consisting of charged particles with long-range interaction.
The distribution function is discretized in discrete particle velocity space.
After the Vlasov equation is integrated in finite volumes of physical space,
the numerical flux across a cell interface and source term for particle
acceleration are computed to update the distribution function at next time
step. The flux is decided by Riemann problem and variation of distribution
function in discrete particle velocity space is evaluated with central
difference method. A electron-ion collision model is introduced in the Vlasov
equation. This finite volume method for the UGKS couples the free transport and
long-range interaction between particles. The electric field induced by charged
particles is controlled by the Poisson's equation. In this paper, the Poisson's
equation is solved using the Green's function for two dimensional plasma system
subjected to the symmetry or periodic boundary conditions. Two numerical tests
of the linear Landau damping and the Gaussian beam are carried out to validate
the proposed method. The linear electron plasma wave damping is simulated based
on electron-ion collision operator. Compared with previous methods, it is shown

capacity of storing and processing the agents moving over a multilayer network,
and their congestions trigger temporary faults which, in turn, dynamically
affect the routing of agents seeking for uncongested paths. The study of the
network performance under different layer velocities and node maximum
capacities, reveals the existence of delicate trade-offs between the number of
served agents and their time to travel to destination. We provide analytical
estimates of the optimal buffer size at which the travel time is minimum and of
its dependence on the velocity and number of links at the different layers.
Phenomena reminiscent of the Slower Is Faster (SIF) effect and of the Braess'

most studied methods for converting solar energy into clean fuel because of its
simplicity and potentially low cost. Despite over 40 years of intensive
research, PEC water splitting remains in its early stages with stable
efficiencies far less than 10%, a benchmark for commercial applications. Here,
we revealed that the desired photocorrosion stability sets a limit of 2.48 eV
(relative to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)) for the highest possible
potential of the valence band (VB) edge of a photocorrosion-resistant
semiconducting photocatalyst. We further demonstrated that such limitation has
a deep root in underlying physics after deducing the relation between energy
position of the valence band edge and free-energy for a semiconductor. The
disparity between the stability-limited VB potential at 2.48 V and the oxygen
evolution reaction (OER) potential at 1.23 V vs NHE reduces the maximum STH
conversion efficiency to approximately 8% for long-term stable single-bandgap
PEC water splitting cells. Based on this understanding, we suggest that the
most promising strategy to overcome this 8% efficiency limit is to decouple the
requirements of efficient light harvesting and chemical stability by protecting
the active semiconductor photocatalyst surface with a photocorrosion-resistant
oxide coating layer.

Here, we incorporate the aforementioned heterogeneities into a model by
considering a dual-layer static-dynamic multiplex network. The static network
layer affords tunable clustering and describes an individual's permanent
community structure. The dynamic network layer describes the transient
connections an individual makes with members of the wider population by
imposing constant edge rewiring. We follow the edge-based compartmental
modelling approach to derive equations describing the evolution of a
susceptible - infected - recovered (SIR) epidemic spreading through this
multiplex network of individuals. We derive the basic reproduction number,
measuring the expected number of new infectious cases caused by a single
infectious individual in an otherwise susceptible population. We validate model
equations by showing convergence to pre-existing edge-based compartmental model
equations in limiting cases and by comparison with stochastically simulated
epidemics. We explore the effects of altering model parameters and multiplex
network attributes on resultant epidemic dynamics. We validate the basic
reproduction number by plotting its value against associated final epidemic
sizes measured from simulation and predicted by model equations for a number of
setups. Further, we explore the effect of varying individual model parameters
on the basic reproduction number. We conclude with a discussion of the
significance and interpretation of the model and its relation to existing

equations of motion and is seen to be formally similar to the force by the
electromagnetic field on a moving charged particle . When confined to a sphere
of radius R, it is shown that the Hamiltonian of this non-relativistic
oscillator can be expressed as a mere kinetic energy operator with an anomalous
part. As a result, the power by the spin force and torque operators in this

explicitly and its torque is shown to be equal to the rate of change of the
kinetic orbital angular momentum operator, again with an anomalous part. This,
along with the conservation of the total angular momentum, suggest that the
spin force exerts a spin-dependent torque on the kinetic orbital angular
momentum operator in order to conserve total angular momentum. The presence of
an anomalous spin part in the kinetic orbital angular momentum operator gives
rise to an oscillatory behavior similar to the \textit{Zitterbewegung}. It is
suggested that the underlying physics that gives rise to the spin force and the

Using the NuSTAR data, we find that this decrease was consistent with a linear
decay throughout most of the outburst, and flattened or even reversed at the

the subcritical regime. We also confirm that by the following outburst in 2016

equation of state (EoS). To include the EoSs in the evolution, we devised and
tested a new fitting formula for the interacting part of the baryon
free-energy, valid at finite temperature and arbitrary degeneracy. Using our
code, we provide estimates for the neutrino signal in the Super-Kamiokande III
detector and the frequencies of the gravitational waves due to stellar
oscillations, for three stellar masses and three nucleonic EoSs. For the first
time we evolve a PNS with a nuclear many-body theory EoS in a consistent way,
that is, we take into account realistic nuclear interactions in the computation
of the neutrino cross sections. By including rotation in an effective way, we
have also determined the time variation of the rotation frequency due to PNS
contraction and neutrino angular momentum loss, and the gravitational wave
signal due to rotation. We find that the mass shedding limit restricts the
initial angular momentum. Consequently, the final rotation frequency has to be
smaller than about 300 Hz for a PNS of about 1.6 solar masses whose EoS is
described by the GM3 mean-field model.

the cornerstone of most approaches to quantization of gravity. One can find in
the literature the opinion that the Wheeler -- DeWitt equation is even more
fundamental than the basic equation of quantum theory, the Schr\""odinger
equation. We still should remember that we are in the situation when no
observational data can confirm or reject the fundamental status of the Wheeler
-- DeWitt equation, so we can give just indirect arguments in favor of or
against it, grounded on mathematical consistency and physical relevance. I
shall present the analysis of the situation and comparison of the standard
Wheeler -- DeWitt approach with the extended phase space approach to
quantization of gravity. In my analysis I suppose, firstly, that a future
quantum theory of gravity must be applicable to all phenomena from the early
Universe to quantum effects in strong gravitational fields, in the latter case
the state of the observer may appear to be significant. Secondly, I suppose
that the equation for the wave function of the Universe must not be postulated
but derived by means of a mathematically consistent procedure. One should take
into account features of gravity, namely, non-trivial spacetime topology and
possible absence of asymptotic states. The Schr\""odinger equation has been
derived early for cosmological models with a finite number of degrees of
freedom, and just recently it has been found for the spherically symmetric
model which is a simplest model with an infinite number of degrees of freedom.
The structure of the Schr\""odinger equation and its general solution appears to
be very similar in these cases. The obtained results give grounds to say that
the Schr\""odinger equation retains its fundamental meaning in constructing
quantum theory of gravity.

function theorem, we give a counterexample to radial symmetry for some
two-phase elliptic overdetermined boundary value problems of Serrin-type.
Afterwards, we consider the following setting for a two-phase parabolic
overdetermined problem. We suppose that, initially, the conductor has
temperature 0 and, at all times, its boundary is kept at temperature 1. A
hypersurface in the domain has the constant flow property if at every of its
points the heat flux across surface only depends on time. It is shown that the
structure of the conductor must be spherical, if either there is a surface of
the constant flow property in the shell near the boundary or a connected
component of the boundary of the heat conductor is a surface of the constant
flow property. Also, by assuming that the medium outside the conductor has a
possibly different conductivity, we consider a Cauchy problem in which the
conductor has initial inside temperature $0$ and outside temperature $1$. We
then show that a quite similar symmetry result holds true.

In
several areas, the spiking response (to a repeated stimulus) has shown a higher

model to explain this low variability is still lacking. Here we introduce a new
model, with a correction to Poisson statistics, which can accurately predict
the regularity of neural spike trains in response to a repeated stimulus. The
model has only two parameters, but can reproduce the observed variability in
retinal recordings in various conditions. We show analytically why this
approximation can work. In a model of the spike emitting process where a
refractory period is assumed, we derive that our simple correction can well
approximate the spike train statistics over a broad range of firing rates. Our
model can be easily plugged to stimulus processing models, like
Linear-nonlinear model or its generalizations, to replace the Poisson spike
train hypothesis that is commonly assumed. It estimates the amount of
information transmitted much more accurately than Poisson models in retinal
recordings. Thanks to its simplicity this model has the potential to explain

existence of scale-dependent feedbacks (SDF) in plant-to-plant and plant-water
interactions. Short distances are dominated by facilitative interactions,
whereas competitive interactions dominate at larger scales. These feedbacks
shape spatially inhomogeneous distributions of water that ultimately drive the
emergence of patterns of vegetation. Even though the presence of facilitative
and competitive interactions is clear, they are often hard to disentangle in
the field, and therefore their relevance in vegetation pattern formation is
still disputable. Here, we review the biological processes that have been
proposed to explain pattern formation in arid ecosystems and how they have been
implemented in mathematical models. We conclude by discussing the existence of
similar structures in different biological and physical systems.

Detection of tumour in Computed Tomography scan is a tedious and tricky task
which requires expert knowledge and a lot of human working hours. As small

be misdiagnosed causing the patient to become terminal. This paper introduces a
novel fully automated framework which helps to detect and segment tumour, if
present in a lung CT scan series. It also provides useful analysis of the
detected tumour such as its approximate volume, centre location and more. The
framework provides a single click solution which analyses all CT images of a
single patient series in one go. It helps to reduce the work of manually going
through each CT slice and provides quicker and more accurate tumour diagnosis.
It makes use of customized image processing and image segmentation methods, to
detect and segment the prospective tumour region from the CT scan. It then uses
a trained ensemble classifier to correctly classify the segmented region as
being tumour or not. Tumour analysis further computed can then be used to
determine malignity of the tumour. With an accuracy of 98.14%, the implemented
framework can be used in various practical scenarios, capable of eliminating
need of any expert pathologist intervention.

a peak energy $E_{p}\sim 145$ keV during the initial main emission between -0.3
and 0.4 s. The origin of this short GRB is still under debate, but a plausible
interpretation is that it is due to the off-axis emission from a structured
jet. We consider two possibilities. First, since the best-fit spectral model
for the main pulse of GRB 170817A is a cutoff power law with a hard low-energy
photon index ($\alpha =-0.62_{-0.54}^{+0.49} $), we consider an off-axis
photosphere model. We develop a theory of photosphere emission in a structured
jet and find that such a model can reproduce a low-energy photon index that is
softer than a blackbody through enhancing high-latitude emission. The model can
naturally account for the observed spectrum. The best-fit Lorentz factor along
the line of sight is $\sim 20$, which demands that there is a significant delay
between the merger and jet launching. Alternatively, we consider that the
emission is produced via synchrotron radiation in an optically thin region in
an expanding jet with decreasing magnetic fields. This model does not require a
delay of jet launching but demands a larger bulk Lorentz factor along the line
of sight. We perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo fitting to the data within the
framework of both models and obtain good fitting results in both cases.

between the femtometer scale of vortex cores and the kilometre scale of the
star makes quantum dynamical simulations of the problem computationally
intractable. In this paper we take a first step towards developing a mean field
prescription to include the dynamics of vortices in large scale hydrodynamical
simulations of superfluid neutron stars. We consider a one dimensional setup
and show that vortex accumulation and differential rotation in the neutron
superfluid lead to propagating waves, or `avalanches', as solutions for the
equations of motion for the superfluid velocities. We introduce an additional
variable, the fraction of free vortices, and test different prescriptions for
its advection with the superfluid flow. We find that the new terms lead to
solutions with a linear component in the rise of a glitch, and that, in
specific setups, they can give rise to glitch precursors and even to decreases

presented for a ductile metal, with reference to the incremental mechanics of a
material obeying the J 2-deformation theory of plasticity (a special form of
prestressed, elastic, anisotropic, and incompressible solid). The treatment
originates from the derivation of integral representations relating the
incremental mechan- ical fields at every point of the medium to the incremental
displacement jump across the shear band faces, generated by an impinging wave.
The boundary integral equations (under the plane strain assumption) are
numerically approached through a collocation technique, which keeps into
account the singularity at the shear band tips and permits the analysis of an
incident wave impinging a shear band. It is shown that the presence of the
shear band induces a resonance, visible in the incremental displacement field
and in the stress intensity factor at the shear band tips, which promotes shear
band growth. Moreover, the waves scattered by the shear band are shown to
generate a fine texture of vibrations, par- allel to the shear band line and
propagating at a long distance from it, but leaving a sort of conical shadow
zone, which emanates from the tips of the shear band.

across disjoint yet non-overlapping camera views. The most effective way to
match these pedestrians undertaking significant visual variations is to seek
reliably invariant features that can describe the person of interest
faithfully. Most of existing methods are presented in a supervised manner to
produce discriminative features by relying on labeled paired images in
correspondence. However, annotating pair-wise images is prohibitively expensive
in labors, and thus not practical in large-scale networked cameras. Moreover,
seeking comparable representations across camera views demands a flexible model
to address the complex distributions of images. In this work, we study the
co-occurrence statistic patterns between pairs of images, and propose to
crossing Generative Adversarial Network (Cross-GAN) for learning a joint
distribution for cross-image representations in a unsupervised manner. Given a
pair of person images, the proposed model consists of the variational
auto-encoder to encode the pair into respective latent variables, a proposed
cross-view alignment to reduce the view disparity, and an adversarial layer to
seek the joint distribution of latent representations. The learned latent
representations are well-aligned to reflect the co-occurrence patterns of
paired images. We empirically evaluate the proposed model against challenging
datasets, and our results show the importance of joint invariant features in
improving matching rates of person re-id with comparison to semi/unsupervised

massive demand for such services and its resulting insufficient charging
time/resources prohibit the use of centralized management and full vehicle
charging. A fog-based multi-class solution for these challenges was recently
suggested, by enabling per-zone management and partial charging for different
classes of AEMoD vehicles. This paper focuses on finding the optimal vehicle
dimensioning for each zone of these systems in order to guarantee a bounded
response time of its vehicles. Using a queuing model representing the
multi-class charging and dispatching processes, we first derive the stability
conditions and the number of system classes to guarantee the response time
bound. Decisions on the proportions of each class vehicles to partially/fully
charge, or directly serve customers are then optimized so as to minimize the
vehicles in-flow to any given zone. Excess waiting times of customers in rare
critical events, such as limited charging resources and/or limited vehicles
availabilities, are also investigated. Results show the merits of our proposed
model compared to other schemes and in usual and critical scenarios.

Observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) can be used to derive
accurate cosmological distances through empirical standardization techniques.
Despite this success neither the progenitors of SNe Ia nor the explosion
process are fully understood. The U-band region has been less well observed for
nearby SNe, due to technical challenges, but is the most readily accessible
band for high-redshift SNe.
  Aims. Using spectrophotometry from the Nearby Supernova Factory, we study the
origin and extent of U-band spectroscopic variations in SNe Ia and explore
consequences for their standardization and the potential for providing new
insights into the explosion process.
  Methods. We divide the U-band spectrum into four wavelength regions
{\lambda}(uNi), {\lambda}(uTi), {\lambda}(uSi) and {\lambda}(uCa). Two of these
span the Ca H&K {\lambda}{\lambda} 3934, 3969 complex. We employ spectral
synthesis using SYNAPPS to associate the two bluer regions with Ni/Co and Ti.
  Results. (1) The flux of the uTi feature is an extremely sensitive
temperature/luminosity indicator, standardizing the SN peak luminosity to 0.116
$\pm$ 0.011 mag RMS. A traditional SALT2.4 fit on the same sample yields a
0.135 mag RMS. Standardization using uTi also reduces the difference in
corrected magnitude between SNe originating from different host galaxy
environments. (2) Early U-band spectra can be used to probe the Ni+Co
distribution in the ejecta, thus offering a rare window into the source of
lightcurve power. (3) The uCa flux further improves standardization, yielding a
0.086 $\pm$ 0.010 mag RMS without the need to include an additional intrinsic
dispersion to reach {\chi}$^2$/dof $\sim$ 1. This reduction in RMS is partially
driven by an improved standardization of Shallow Silicon and 91T-like SNe.

$N$-body problem with the rigid body treated as a 1D continuum (i.e. the body
is treated as a rod with an arbitrary mass distribution). Such a model provides
a good approximation to highly asymmetric geometries, such as the recently
observed interstellar asteroid 'Oumuamua, but is also amenable to analysis. We
analytically demonstrate the existence of homoclinic chaos in the case where
one of the orbits is nearly circular by way of the Melnikov method, and give
numerical evidence for chaos when the orbits are more complicated. We show that
the extent of chaos in parameter space is strongly tied to the deviations from
a purely circular orbit. These results suggest that chaos is ubiquitous in
many-body problems when one or more of the rigid bodies exhibits non-spherical
and highly asymmetric geometries. The excitation of chaotic rotations does not
appear to require tidal dissipation, obliquity variation, or orbital resonance.
Such dynamics give a possible explanation for routes to chaotic dynamics
observed in $N$-body systems such as the Pluto system where some of the bodies
are highly non-spherical.

an important component in our understanding of discrimination in activities
such as hiring, promotion, and school admissions. Research on implicit bias
posits that when people evaluate others -- for example, in a hiring context --
their unconscious biases about membership in particular groups can have an
effect on their decision-making, even when they have no deliberate intention to
discriminate against members of these groups. A growing body of experimental
work has pointed to the effect that implicit bias can have in producing adverse
outcomes.
  Here we propose a theoretical model for studying the effects of implicit bias
on selection decisions, and a way of analyzing possible procedural remedies for
implicit bias within this model. A canonical situation represented by our model
is a hiring setting: a recruiting committee is trying to choose a set of
finalists to interview among the applicants for a job, evaluating these
applicants based on their future potential, but their estimates of potential
are skewed by implicit bias against members of one group. In this model, we
show that measures such as the Rooney Rule, a requirement that at least one of
the finalists be chosen from the affected group, can not only improve the
representation of this affected group, but also lead to higher payoffs in
absolute terms for the organization performing the recruiting. However,
identifying the conditions under which such measures can lead to improved
payoffs involves subtle trade-offs between the extent of the bias and the
underlying distribution of applicant characteristics, leading to novel
theoretical questions about order statistics in the presence of probabilistic
side information.

enables the provision of Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees to the end user.
We have also developed an evaluation platform based on ns-3 to evaluate the
performance offered by the architecture. Experimental results obtained using
the platform demonstrate the benefits provided by our architecture.

In this article, the authors show that the commutator $[b,C_\Gamma]$ is bounded
(resp., compact) on the Morrey space $L^{p,\,\lambda}(\mathbb R)$ for any (or
some) $p\in(1, \infty)$ and $\lambda\in(0, 1)$ if and only if $b\in {\rm
BMO}(\mathbb R)$ (resp., ${\rm CMO}(\mathbb R)$). As an application, a
factorization of the classical Hardy space $H^1(\mathbb R)$ in terms of
$C_\Gamma$ and its adjoint operator is obtained.

big data analytics and Natural language processing, in order to improve their
productivity and competitiveness. Current challenges facing the higher
education sector include a rapidly changing and evolving environment, which
necessitates the development of new ways of thinking. Interest has therefore
increased in analytics as part of the solution to many issues in higher
education, including the rate of student attrition and learner support. This
study provides a comprehensive discussion of big data, learning analytics and
use of NLP in higher education. In addition, it introduces an integrated
learning analytics solution leveraging a distributed technology system capable
of supporting academic authorities and advisors at educational institutions in
making decisions concerning individual students.

real-time analytes detection is highly desirable. Nowadays, toxic or colorless
gas detection, air pollution monitoring, harmful chemical, pressure, strain,
humidity, and temperature sensors based on photonic crystal fiber (PCF) are
increasing rapidly due to its compact structure, fast response and efficient
light controlling capabilities. The propagating light through the PCF can be
controlled by varying the structural parameters and core-cladding materials, as
a result, evanescent field can be enhanced significantly which is the main
component of the PCF based gas/chemical sensors. The aim of this chapter is to
(1) describe the principle operation of PCF based gas/ chemical sensors, (2)
discuss the important PCF properties for optical sensors, (3) extensively
discuss the different types of microstructured optical fiber based gas/
chemical sensors, (4) study the effects of different core-cladding shapes, and
fiber background materials on sensing performance, and (5) highlight the main
challenges of PCF based gas/ chemical sensors and possible solutions.

second law of thermodynamics applied to thermal motors and their efficiency. In
most cases they involve a negative slope, linear process that presents an
adiabatic point where the process is tangent to an adiabatic curve and $\delta
Q=0$, signalling that the flow of heat is reversed. We introduce a parabolic
process, still simple enough to be fully explored analitically in order to deal
with the usual follow up question on the possibility of having more than one
adiabatic point. Having one (linear), two (parabolic) or more such points allow
the construction of reversible, non-isoentropic processes, that we call
pseudoadiabatics, whose total heat exchanged is zero.
