considered one of the few main-belt bodies that could be an exposed
proto-planetary metallic core and that would thus be related to iron
meteorites. Such an association is however challenged by both its near- and
mid-infrared spectral properties and the reported estimates of its density.
Here, we aim to refine the density of (16) Psyche to set further constraints on
its bulk composition and determine its potential meteoritic analog.
  We observed (16) Psyche with ESO VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL as part of our large
program (ID 199.C-0074). We used the high angular resolution of these
observations to refine Psyche's three-dimensional (3D) shape model and
subsequently its density when combined with the most recent mass estimates. In
addition, we searched for potential companions around the asteroid. We derived
a bulk density of 3.99\,$\pm$\,0.26\,g$\cdot$cm$^{-3}$ for Psyche. While such
density is incompatible at the 3-sigma level with any iron meteorites
($\sim$7.8\,g$\cdot$cm$^{-3}$), it appears fully consistent with that of
stony-iron meteorites such as mesosiderites (density
$\sim$4.25\,$\cdot$cm$^{-3}$). In addition, we found no satellite in our images
and set an upper limit on the diameter of any non-detected satellite of
1460\,$\pm$\,200}\,m at 150\,km from Psyche (0.2\%\,$\times$\,R$_{Hill}$, the
Hill radius) and 800\,$\pm$\,200\,m at 2,000\,km (3\%\,$\times$\,$R_{Hill}$).
  Considering that the visible and near-infrared spectral properties of
mesosiderites are similar to those of Psyche, there is merit to a
long-published initial hypothesis that Psyche could be a plausible candidate
parent body for mesosiderites.

The analogy is extended to include an energy difference between the two
superfluids caused by an asymmetry in the trapping potential. The model is
compatible with the mean-field predictions of the two-mode Bose-Hubbard model.
It gives new insights on the mean-field model by involving experimentally
measurable parameters with reduced correlations. For agreement with recent

energy from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) kink waves in flux tubes, and to drive
dissipation of this wave energy through turbulence. It is therefore a
potentially important process in heating the solar corona. However, it is
unclear how the instability is influenced by the oscillatory shear flow
associated with an MHD wave. We investigate the linear stability of a
discontinuous oscillatory shear flow in the presence of a horizontal magnetic
field within a Cartesian framework that captures the essential features of MHD
oscillations in flux tubes. We derive a Mathieu equation for the Lagrangian
displacement of the interface and analyse its properties, identifying two
different instabilities: a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and a parametric
instability involving resonance between the oscillatory shear flow and two
surface Alfv\'{e}n waves. The latter occurs when the system is Kelvin-Helmholtz
stable, thus favouring modes that vary along the flux tube, and as a
consequence provides an important and additional mechanism to extract energy.
When applied to flows with the characteristic properties of kink waves in the
solar corona, both instabilities can grow, with the parametric instability
capable of generating smaller scale disturbances along the magnetic field than
possible via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The characteristic time-scale
for these instabilities is $\sim 100$ s, for wavelengths of $200$ km. The
parametric instability is more likely to occur for smaller density contrasts
and larger velocity shears, making its development more likely on coronal loops
than on prominence threads.

generated in ultracold gases in view of realizing topological states of matter
and frustrated magnetism in a highly-controllable environment. Despite being
dynamically tunable, such artificial gauge fields are genuinely classical and
exhibit no back-action from the neutral particles. Here we go beyond this
paradigm, and demonstrate how quantized dynamical gauge fields can be created
in mixtures of ultracold atoms in optical lattices. Specifically, we propose a
protocol by which atoms of one species carry a magnetic flux felt by another
species, hence realizing an instance of flux-attachment. This is obtained by
combining coherent lattice modulation techniques with strong Hubbard
interactions. We demonstrate how this setting can be arranged so as to
implement lattice models displaying a local Z2 gauge symmetry, both in one and
two dimensions. We also provide a detailed analysis of a ladder toy model,
which features a global Z2 symmetry, and reveal the phase transitions that
occur both in the matter and gauge sectors. Mastering flux-attachment in
optical lattices envisages a new route towards the realization of
strongly-correlated systems with properties dictated by an interplay of
dynamical matter and gauge fields.

the tagged photon facility of the Mainz MAMI accelerator with the combined
Crystal Ball - TAPS calorimeter. The experiment used a polarized deuterated
butanol target and a circularly polarized photon beam. This arrangement allowed
the $\sigma_{1/2}$ (photon and target spin antiparallel) and $\sigma_{3/2}$
(parallel spins) components to be measured for quasi-free production of
$\pi^0\eta$ pairs off protons and neutrons. The main finding is that the two
helicity components contribute identically, within uncertainties, for both
participant protons and neutrons. The absolute couplings for protons and
neutrons are also identical. This means that nucleon resonances contributing to
this reaction in the investigated energy range have almost equal
electromagnetic helicity couplings, $A_{1/2}^{n,p}$ and $A_{3/2}^{n,p}$.
Identical couplings for protons and neutrons are typical for $\Delta$
resonances and identical $A_{1/2}$ and $A_{3/2}$ components are only possible
for $J\geq 3/2$ states, which constrains possible contributions of nucleon
resonances.

power system involves solving a large set of differential algebraic equations
(DAEs) at every simulation time-step. With the ever-growing size and complexity
of power grids, dynamic simulation becomes more time-consuming and
computationally difficult using conventional sequential simulation techniques.
To cope with this challenge, this paper aims to develop a fully distributed
approach intended for implementation on High Performance Computer (HPC)
clusters. A novel, relaxation-based domain decomposition algorithm known as
Parallel-General-Norton with Multiple-port Equivalent (PGNME) is proposed as
the core technique of a two-stage decomposition approach to divide the overall
dynamic simulation problem into a set of subproblems that can be solved
concurrently to exploit parallelism and scalability. While the convergence
property has traditionally been a concern for relaxation-based decomposition,
an estimation mechanism based on multiple-port network equivalent is adopted as
the preconditioner to enhance the convergence of the proposed algorithm. The
proposed algorithm is illustrated using rigorous mathematics and validated both
in terms of speed-up and capability. Moreover, a complexity analysis is
performed to support the observation that PGNME scales well when the size of
the subproblems are sufficiently large.

(AuNP) in vacuum as a function of ligand coverage and particle separation in
three state of aggregation: the isolated AuNP, an isolated pair of AuNPs and a
square assembly of AuNPs. Our calculations show that for all values of the
coverage the ligand density along a radius emanating from the core of an
isolated AuNP oscillates along the chain up to the fourth pseudo-atom, then
smoothly decays to zero. We examine the ligand envelope as a function of the
coverage and demonstrate that the deformation of that envelope generated by
interaction between the NPs is coverage-dependent, so that the shape, depth and
position of the minimum of the potential of mean force displays a systematic
dependence on the coverage. We propose an accurate analytical description of
the calculated potential of mean force with parameters that scale linearly with
the ligand coverage. We define and calculate an effective pair potential of
mean force for a square configuration of particles; our definition contains,
implicitly, both the three- and four-particle contributions to deviation from
additivity. We find that the effective pair potential of mean force in this
configuration has a different minimum and a different well depth than the
isolated pair potential of mean force. Previous work has found that the
three-particle contribution to deviation from additivity is monotone repulsive,
whereas we find that the combined three- and four-particle contributions have
an attractive well, implying that the three- and four-particle contributions
are of comparable magnitude but opposite sign, thereby suggesting that even
higher order correction terms likely play a significant role in the behavior of
assemblies of many nanoparticles.

(SIVI) and introduce doubly semi-implicit variational inference (DSIVI), a way
to perform variational inference and learning when both the approximate
posterior and the prior distribution are semi-implicit. In other words, DSIVI
performs inference in models where the prior and the posterior can be expressed
as an intractable infinite mixture of some analytic density with a highly
flexible implicit mixing distribution. We provide a sandwich bound on the
evidence lower bound (ELBO) objective that can be made arbitrarily tight.
Unlike discriminator-based and kernel-based approaches to implicit variational
inference, DSIVI optimizes a proper lower bound on ELBO that is asymptotically
exact. We evaluate DSIVI on a set of problems that benefit from implicit
priors. In particular, we show that DSIVI gives rise to a simple modification
of VampPrior, the current state-of-the-art prior for variational autoencoders,
which improves its performance.

the extended direction and have kinetic terms constructed out from Lovelock

ensures that the whole theory is second order. For spherically, hyperbolic and

are light thermal relics of the hot big bang. Within the Standard Model of
particle physics, an important thermal relic are cosmic neutrinos, while
interesting extensions predict new light particles which are even more weakly
coupled to ordinary matter. These elusive particles may nonetheless be produced
efficiently in the early universe and their gravitational influence could be
detectable in cosmological observables. In this thesis, we describe how
measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the large-scale
structure (LSS) of the universe can shed new light on the properties of
neutrinos and on the possible existence of other light relics.
  These observations are remarkably sensitive to the amount of radiation in the
early universe, partly because free-streaming species such as neutrinos imprint
a small phase shift in the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) which we study in
detail. Building on this analytic understanding, we provide further evidence
for the cosmic neutrino background by independently confirming its
free-streaming nature in CMB and LSS datasets. In particular, we establish a
new analysis of the BAO spectrum resulting in the first measurement of this
imprint of neutrinos in the clustering of galaxies.
  Future cosmological surveys, such as the next generation of CMB experiments
(CMB-S4), have the potential to measure the energy density of relativistic
species at the sub-percent level and will therefore be capable of probing
physics beyond the Standard Model. We demonstrate how this can be achieved and
present an observational target which would allow the detection of any light
particle that has ever been in thermal equilibrium. Interestingly, even the
absence of a detection would result in new insights by providing constraints on
the couplings to the Standard Model. [Abridged]

simple two-field generalization of the $T$-model, which has received renewed
attention in the literature. Krajewski et al. concluded, using lattice
simulations, that multi-field effects can dramatically speed-up preheating. We
recover their results and further demonstrate that significant analytical
progress can be made for preheating in these models using the WKB approximation
and Floquet analysis. We find a simple scaling behavior of the Floquet
exponents for large values of the field-space curvature, that enables a quick
estimation of the $T$-model reheating efficiency for any large value of the
field-space curvature. In this regime we further observe and explain universal
preheating features that arise for different values of the potential steepness.
In general preheating is faster for larger negative values of the field-space
curvature and steeper potentials. For very highly curved field-space manifolds
preheating is essentially instantaneous.

and Tyrtyshnikov, and Tilli. Considering (real) nonsymmetric Toeplitz matrix
sequences, we first symmetrize them via a simple permutation matrix and then we
show that the singular value and spectral distribution of the symmetrized
matrix sequence can be obtained analytically, by using the notion of
approximating class of sequences. In particular, under the assumption that the
symbol is sparsely vanishing, we show that roughly half of the eigenvalues of
the symmetrized Toeplitz matrix (i.e. a Hankel matrix) are negative/positive
for sufficiently large dimension, i.e. the matrix sequence is symmetric
(asymptotically) indefinite.

  Systems","15 pages, 8 figures",,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The possibility of rate-induced tipping (R-tipping) away from an attracting
fixed point has been thoroughly explored in 1-dimensional systems. In these
systems, it is impossible to have R-tipping away from a path of quasi-stable
equilibria that is forward basin stable (FBS), but R-tipping is guaranteed for
paths that are non-FBS of a certain type. We will investigate whether these
results carry over to multi-dimensional systems. In particular, we will show
that the same conditions guaranteeing R-tipping in 1-dimension also guarantee
R-tipping in higher dimensions; however, it is possible to have R-tipping away
from a path that is FBS even in 2-dimensional systems. We will propose a
different condition, forward inflowing stability (FIS), which we show is
sufficient to prevent R-tipping in all dimensions. The condition, while
natural, is difficult to verify in concrete examples. Monotone systems are a
class for which FIS is implied by an easily verifiable condition. As a result,
we see how the additional structure of these systems makes predicting the
possibility of R-tipping straightforward in a fashion similar to 1-dimension.
In particular, we will prove that the FBS and FIS conditions in monotone
systems reduce to comparing the relative positions of equilibria over time. An
example of a monotone system is given that demonstrates how these ideas are
applied to determine exactly when R-tipping is possible.

  pairing in half-filled quantum Hall bilayers","9 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Half-filled Landau levels admit the theoretically powerful fermion-vortex
duality but longstanding puzzles remain in their experimental realization as
$\nu_T=1$ quantum Hall bilayers, further complicated by Zheng et al's recent
numerical discovery of an unknown phase at intermediate layer spacing. Here we
propose that half-filled quantum Hall bilayers ($\nu_T=1$) at intermediate
values of the interlayer distance $d/\ell_B$ enter a phase with \textit{paired
exciton condensation}. This phase shows signatures analogous to the condensate
of interlayer excitons (electrons bound to opposite-layer holes) well-known for
small $d$ but importantly condenses only exciton pairs. To study it
theoretically we derive an effective Hamiltonian for bosonic excitons $b_k$ and
show that the single-boson condensate suddenly vanishes for $d$ above a
critical $d_{c1} \approx 0.95 l_B$. The nonzero condensation fraction
$n_0=\langle b(0) \rangle ^2$ at $d_{c1}$ suggests that the phase stiffness
remains nonzero for a range of $d>d_{c1}$ via an intermediate phase of
paired-exciton condensation, exhibiting $\langle bb \rangle \neq 0$ while
$\langle b \rangle =0$. Motivated by these results we derive a $K$-matrix
description of the paired exciton condensate's topological properties from
composite boson theory. The elementary charged excitation is a half meron with
$\frac{1}{4}$ charge and fractional self-statistics $\theta_s=\frac{\pi}{16}$.
Finally we argue for an equivalent description via the $d=\infty$ limit through
topological charge-$4e$ pairing of composite fermions. We suggest graphene
double layers should access this phase and propose various experimental
signatures, including an Ising transition $T_{Ising}$ below the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition $T_{BKT}$ at $d \sim d_{c1}$.

to some unknown distribution $\mathbf{p}$ over a domain $\mathcal{J}=[J]$ based
on a sensitive data set of $n$ individuals under the constraint of local
differential privacy. This problem subsumes a wide range of estimation tasks,
e.g., distribution estimation and $d$-dimensional mean estimation. We provide
new algorithms for both the offline (non-adaptive) and adaptive versions of
this problem.
  In the offline setting, the set of queries are fixed before the algorithm
starts. In the regime where $n\lesssim d^2/\log(J)$, our algorithms attain
$L_2$ estimation error that is independent of $d$, and is tight up to a factor
of $\tilde{O}\left(\log^{1/4}(J)\right)$. For the special case of distribution
estimation, we show that projecting the output estimate of an algorithm due to
[Acharya et al. 2018] on the probability simplex yields an $L_2$ error that
depends only sub-logarithmically on $J$ in the regime where $n\lesssim
J^2/\log(J)$. These results show the possibility of accurate estimation of
linear queries in the high-dimensional settings under the $L_2$ error
criterion.
  In the adaptive setting, the queries are generated over $d$ rounds; one query
at a time. In each round, a query can be chosen adaptively based on all the
history of previous queries and answers. We give an algorithm for this problem
with optimal $L_{\infty}$ estimation error (worst error in the estimated values
for the queries w.r.t. the data distribution). Our bound matches a lower bound
on the $L_{\infty}$ error for the offline version of this problem [Duchi et al.

crucial for studying the evolution of the Galaxy. But determining ages of field
stars is notoriously difficult; therefore, we attempt to determine benchmark
ages for the extensively studied Gaia benchmark stars which can be used for
validation purposes. By searching the literature for age estimates from
different methods and deriving new ages based on Bayesian isochrone fitting, we
are able to put reliable limits on the ages of 16 out of the 33 benchmark
stars. The giants with well-defined ages are all young, and an expansion of the
sample to include older giants with asteroseismic ages would be beneficial.
Some of the stars have surface parameters inconsistent with isochrones younger
than 16 Gyr. Including $\alpha$-enhancement in the models when relevant
resolves some of these cases, but others clearly highlight discrepancies
between the models and observations. We test the impact of atomic diffusion on
the age estimates by fitting to the actual surface metallicity of the models
instead of the initial value and find that the effect is negligible except for
a single turn-off star. Finally, we show that our ability to determine
isochrone-based ages for large spectroscopic surveys largely mirrors our
ability to determine ages for these benchmark stars, except for stars with
$\log g \gtrsim 4.4$ dex since their location in the HR diagram is almost age
insensitive. Hence, isochrone fitting does not constrain their ages given the
typical uncertainties of spectroscopic stellar parameters.

the extremely metal-poor star-forming dwarf galaxy DDO 68. They are derived
from deep spectra in the wavelength range 3500 - 10,000 {\AA}, acquired with
the Multi Object Double Spectrograph (MODS) at the Large Binocular Telescope
(LBT). In the three regions where the [O III]$\lambda$4363 {\AA} line was
detected, we inferred the abundance of He, N, O, Ne, Ar, and S through the
""direct"" method. We also derived the oxygen abundances of all the six regions
adopting indirect method calibrations. We confirm that DDO 68 is an extremely
metal-poor galaxy, and a strong outlier in the luminosity - metallicity
relation defined by star-forming galaxies. With the direct-method we find
indeed an oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H)=7.14$\pm$0.07 in the northernmost
region of the galaxy and, although with large uncertainties, an even lower
12+log(O/H)=6.96$\pm$0.09 in the ""tail"". This is, at face value, the most
metal-poor direct abundance detection of any galaxy known. We derive a radial
oxygen gradient of -0.06$\pm$0.03 dex/kpc (or -0.30 dex $R_{25}^{-1}$) with the
direct method, and a steeper gradient of -0.12$\pm$0.03 dex/kpc (or -0.59 dex
$R_{25}^{-1}$) from the indirect method. For the $\alpha$-element to oxygen
ratios we obtain values in agreement with those found in other metal-poor
star-forming dwarfs. For nitrogen, instead, we infer much higher values,
leading to log(N/O)$\sim-1.4$, at variance with the suggested existence of a
tight plateau at $-1.6$ in extremely metal poor dwarfs. The derived helium mass
fraction ranges from Y=0.240$\pm$0.005 to Y=0.25$\pm$0.02, compatible with
standard big bang nucleosynthesis. Finally, we measured HII region radial

companies or organizations. Manually screening to select appropriate candidates

there is no public tool that can be directly used for automatic resume quality
assessment (RQA). This motivates us to develop a method for automatic RQA.
Since there is also no public dataset for model training and evaluation, we
build a dataset for RQA by collecting around 10K resumes, which are provided by
a private resume management company. By investigating the dataset, we identify
some factors or features that could be useful to discriminate good resumes from
bad ones, e.g., the consistency between different parts of a resume. Then a
neural-network model is designed to predict the quality of each resume, where
some text processing techniques are incorporated. To deal with the label
deficiency issue in the dataset, we propose several variants of the model by
either utilizing the pair/triplet-based loss, or introducing some
semi-supervised learning technique to make use of the abundant unlabeled data.
Both the presented baseline model and its variants are general and easy to
implement. Various popular criteria including the receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve, F-measure and ranking-based average precision (AP)
are adopted for model evaluation. We compare the different variants with our
baseline model. Since there is no public algorithm for RQA, we further compare
our results with those obtained from a website that can score a resume.
Experimental results in terms of different criteria demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. We foresee that our approach would
transform the way of future human resources management.

systems. In more detail, we produce two new randomized algorithms that solve
this problem in the abstract MAC layer model, which captures the basic
interface and communication guarantees provided by most wireless MAC layers.
Our algorithms work for any number of failures, require no advance knowledge of
the network participants or network size, and guarantee termination with high
probability after a number of broadcasts that are polynomial in the network
size. Our first algorithm satisfies the standard agreement property, while our
second trades a faster termination guarantee in exchange for a looser agreement
property in which most nodes agree on the same value. These are the first known
fault-tolerant consensus algorithms for this model. In addition to our main
upper bound results, we explore the gap between the abstract MAC layer and the
standard asynchronous message passing model by proving fault-tolerant consensus
is impossible in the latter in the absence of information regarding the network
participants, even if we assume no faults, allow randomized solutions, and
provide the algorithm a constant-factor approximation of the network size.

a distinct, scale-dependent correction to the line bias. We explore the

coverage of an octave in frequency, to produce significant results, with the
optimized surveys generally covering between $z\sim[2-8]$. As this redshift

the TESS data will have a lower signal-to-noise ratio, rendering some of the

underpinned many advances in spintronics and solid-state quantum optics. The
prototypical example is a semiconductor quantum dot separated from a gated

whereby electrons or holes can be loaded one-by-one into a quantum dot.
Depending on the tunnel-coupling strength, this capability facilitates single
spin quantum bits or coherent many-body interactions between the confined spin
and the Fermi reservoir. Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, in which a wide
range of unique atomic layers can easily be combined, offer novel prospects to
engineer coherent quantum confined spins, tunnel barriers down to the atomic
limit or a Fermi reservoir beyond the conventional flat density of states.
However, gate-control of vdW nanostructures at the single particle level is
needed to unlock their potential. Here we report Coulomb blockade in a vdW
heterostructure consisting of a transition metal dichalcogenide quantum dot
coupled to a graphene contact through an atomically thin hexagonal boron
nitride (hBN) tunnel barrier. Thanks to a tunable Fermi reservoir, we can
deterministically load either a single electron or a single hole into the
quantum dot. We observe hybrid excitons, composed of localized quantum dot
states and delocalized continuum states, arising from ultra-strong
spin-conserving tunnel coupling through the atomically thin tunnel barrier.
Probing the charged excitons in applied magnetic fields, we observe large
gyromagnetic ratios (~8). Our results establish a foundation for engineering
next-generation devices to investigate either novel regimes of Kondo physics or

the SMBHs to coalescence. In this work, we implemented a time-dependent 1D
model to follow the long-term evolution of the coupled binary + discs system,
from a separation of 10^5 down to 20 Schwarzschild radii. We run different
models changing the system parameters, including the binary mass ratio q \leq

the secondary. We find that our implementation yields higher residual masses
and longer binary residence times than previous studies. Our main conclusion is
the non-steady-state nature of the evolution of the system: the properties the
disc had when the binary was still at large separations influence its whole
evolution. To recover steady state, the binary residence time would have to be
much longer than the inflow time-scale of the disc throughout their entire

position. The stabilization of the BCC phase at high temperature is due to the
dynamical average of the low-symmetry minima of the double well due to atomic

efficient away from these environments, which makes voids ideally suited for
testing this class of models. We use N-body simulations of $\Lambda$-cold dark
matter ($\Lambda$CDM) and nGDP universes, where dark matter haloes are
populated with mock galaxies that mimic the clustering and number densities of
the BOSS CMASS galaxy sample. We measure the force, density and weak lensing
profiles around voids identified with six different algorithms. Compared to
$\Lambda$CDM, voids in nDGP are more under-dense due to the action of the fifth
force that arises in these models, which leads to a faster evacuation of matter
from voids. This leaves an imprint on the weak lensing tangential shear profile
around nDGP voids, an effect that is particularly strong for 2D underdensities
that are identified in the plane-of-the-sky. We make predictions for the
feasibility of distinguishing between nDGP and $\Lambda$CDM using void lensing

integrate two or more ontologies (of the same or close domains) in a new
consistent and coherent OWL ontology to insure semantic interoperability
between them. To do this, we have chosen to create a bridge ontology that
includes all source ontologies and their bridging axioms in a customized way.
In addition, we introduced a new criterion for obtaining an ontology of better
quality (having the minimum of semantic/logical conflicts). We have also
proposed new terminology and definitions that clarify the unclear and misplaced
""integration"" and ""merging"" notions that are randomly used in state-of-the-art
works. Finally, we tested and evaluated our OIA2R tool using ontologies and
reference alignments of the OAEI campaign. It turned out that it is generic,
efficient and powerful enough.

involves two players who move alternately in a perfect information, zero-sum
game, and there are no chance devices. Also the games have the finite descent
property (every game terminates in a finite number of moves). The two players
are usually called Left and Right. The games often break up into components and
the players must choose one of the components in which to play. One main aim of
CGT is to analyze the components individually (rather than analyzing the sum as
a whole) then use this information to analyze the sum.
  In this paper, the players move simultaneously in a combinatorial game. Three
sums are considered which are defined by the termination rules: (i) one
component does not have a simultaneous move; (ii) no component has a
simultaneous move; (iii) one player has no move in any component. These are
combined with a winning convention which is either: (i) based on which player
has moves remaining; or (ii) the greatest score. In each combination, we show
that equality of games induces an equivalence relation and the equivalence
classes are partially ordered. Also, where possible, given games $A$ and $B$,
we give checks to determine if Left prefers to replace $A$ by $B$ in a sum.

multiple-input multiple-output systems. When deploying a large number of
antennas at base station (BS), and linear detection/precoding algorithms, the
system performance in both uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) is mainly limited by
pilot contamination. This interference is proper of each pilot, and thus system
performance can be improved by suitably assigning the pilot sequences to the
users within the cell, according to the desired metric. We show in this paper
that UL and DL performances constitute conflicting metrics, in such a way that
one cannot achieve the best performance in UL and DL with a single pilot
assignment configuration. Thus, we propose an alternative metric, namely total
capacity, aiming to simultaneously achieve a suitable performance in both
links. Since the PA problem is combinatorial, and the search space grows with
the number of pilots in a factorial fashion, we also propose a low complexity
suboptimal algorithm that achieves promising capacity performance avoiding the
exhaustive search. Besides, the combination of our proposed PA schemes with an
efficient power control algorithm unveils the great potential of the proposed
techniques in providing improved performance for a higher number of users. Our
numerical results demonstrate that with 64 BS antennas serving 10 users, our
proposed method can assure a 95%-likely rate of 4.2 Mbps for both DL and UL,

effectiveness of a new treatment to the current one (the control). Most RCTs
allocate the patients to the treatment group and the control group by uniform

recruiting the next cohort, and the effects are heterogeneous across

exact solution to this Markov Decision Process is computationally intractable,
we propose an algorithm -- \textit{Knowledge Gradient for Randomized Controlled

significant reduction in error, and to achieve a prescribed level of confidence

requires many fewer patients. Our approach uses what has been learned from the

  Databases",,,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Consumer genetic testing has become immensely popular in recent years and has
lead to the creation of large scale genetic databases containing millions of
dense autosomal genotype profiles. One of the most used features offered by
genetic databases is the ability to find distant relatives using a technique
called relative matching (or DNA matching). Recently, novel uses of relative
matching were discovered that combined matching results with genealogical
information to solve criminal cold cases. New estimates suggest that relative
matching, combined with simple demographic information, could be used to
re-identify a significant percentage of US Caucasian individuals. In this work
we attempt to systematize computer security and privacy risks from relative
matching and describe new security problems that can occur if an attacker
uploads manipulated or forged genetic profiles. For example, forged profiles
can be used by criminals to misdirect investigations, con-artists to defraud
victims, or political operatives to blackmail opponents. We discuss solutions
to mitigate these threats, including existing proposals to use digital
signatures, and encourage the consumer genetics community to consider the
broader security implications of relative matching now that it is becoming so
prominent.

Specifically, deep in-gap defect states of chalcogen vacancies have been

dichalcogenides (TMDs). Here, we report the direct experimental correlation of
the atomic and electronic structure of a sulfur vacancy in monolayer WS2 by a
combination of CO-tip noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) and scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM). Sulfur vacancies, which are absent in as-grown
samples, were deliberately created by annealing in vacuum. Two energetically
narrow unoccupied defect states of the vacancy provide a unique fingerprint of
this defect. Direct imaging of the defect orbitals by STM and state-of-the-art
GW calculations reveal that the large splitting of 252 meV between these defect
states is induced by spin-orbit coupling. The controllable incorporation and
potential decoration of chalcogen vacancies provide a new route to tailor the
optical, catalytic and magnetic properties of TMDs.

for distance-based and density-based algorithms in clustering and anomaly

approximately the same density. As a result, they often exhibit a bias towards
dense clusters in the presence of sparse clusters. Many remedies have been
suggested; yet, we show that they are partial solutions which do not address
the issue satisfactorily. To match the implicit assumption, we propose to
transform a given dataset such that the transformed clusters have approximately
the same density while all regions of locally low density become globally low
density -- homogenising cluster density while preserving the cluster structure
of the dataset. We show that this can be achieved by using a new
multi-dimensional Cumulative Distribution Function in a transform-and-shift
method. The method can be applied to every dataset, before the dataset is used
in many existing algorithms to match their implicit assumption without
algorithmic modification. We show that the proposed method performs better than
existing remedies.

Considering so-called modified Round Robin and Try-Once-Discard protocols,

construct Lyapunov functions for these two protocols, which fit our proposed

the following transmission policy: wait for a certain minimum amount of time

When the latter condition is violated, a transmission occurs. In that way, the
existence of the minimum amount of time between two consecutive transmission is
established and so-called Zeno phenomenon, therefore, is avoided. Finally,
illustrative examples are given to verify the effectiveness of our results.

Accordingly, we introduce, design and analyze the \textit{Memento} family of

implemented Memento as an open-source extension to the popular HAProxy cloud
load-balancer. In our evaluations, using an HTTP flood by 50 subnets, our
network-wide approach detected the new subnets faster, and reduced the number

insoluble like thermosets, but flow when heated like thermoplastics - contain
dynamic links and/or crosslinks that undergo an associative exchange reaction.
These dynamic crosslinks enable vitrimers to have interesting
mechanical/rheological behavior, self-healing, adhesive, and shape memory
properties. We demonstrate that vitrimers can self-assemble into complex meso-
and nanostructures when crosslinks and backbone monomers strongly interact.
Vitrimers featuring polyethylene (PE) as the backbone and dioxaborolane
maleimide as the crosslinkable moiety were studied in both the molten and
semi-crystalline states. We observed that PE vitrimers macroscopically phase
separated into dioxaborolane maleimide rich and poor regions, and characterized
the extent of phase separation by optical transmission measurements. This phase
separation can explain the relatively low insoluble fractions and overall
crystallinities of PE vitrimers. Using synchrotron-sourced small-angle X-ray
scattering (SAXS), we discovered that PE vitrimers and their linear precursors
micro-phase separated into hierarchical nanostructures. Fitting of the SAXS
patterns to a scattering model strongly suggests that the nanostructures -
which persist in both the melt and amorphous fraction of the semi-crystalline
state - may be described as dioxaborolane maleimide rich aggregates packed in a
mass fractal arrangement. These findings of hierarchical meso- and
nanostructures point out that incompatibility effects between network
components and resulting self-assembly must be considered for understanding
behavior and the rational design of vitrimer materials.

black-box crash testing (B3). B3 tests the file system in a black-box manner
using workloads of file-system operations. Since the space of possible
workloads is infinite, B3 bounds this space based on parameters such as the
number of file-system operations or which operations to include, and
exhaustively generates workloads within this bounded space. Each workload is
tested on the target file system by simulating power-loss crashes while the
workload is being executed, and checking if the file system recovers to a
correct state after each crash. B3 builds upon insights derived from our study
of crash-consistency bugs reported in Linux file systems in the last five
years. We observed that most reported bugs can be reproduced using small
workloads of three or fewer file-system operations on a newly-created file
system, and that all reported bugs result from crashes after fsync() related
system calls. We build two tools, CrashMonkey and ACE, to demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach. Our tools are able to find 24 out of the 26
crash-consistency bugs reported in the last five years. Our tools also revealed
10 new crash-consistency bugs in widely-used, mature Linux file systems, seven
of which existed in the kernel since 2014. Our tools also found a

The goal of our work is to provide an approach for improving the accuracy of

shape, size and texture features of nuclei in tissue are important biomarkers
for disease prognosis, and accurate computation of these features depends on
accurate delineation of boundaries of nuclei. Input parameters in many nucleus
segmentation workflows affect segmentation accuracy and have to be tuned for
optimal performance. This is a time-consuming and computationally expensive
process; automating this step facilitates more robust image segmentation
workflows and enables more efficient application of image analysis in large
image datasets. Our software platform adjusts the parameters of a nuclear
segmentation algorithm to maximize the quality of image segmentation results
while minimizing the execution time. It implements several optimization methods
to search the parameter space efficiently. In addition, the methodology is
developed to execute on high performance computing systems to reduce the
execution time of the parameter tuning phase. Our results using three

angles of attack of 0{\deg}, 6{\deg}, and 12{\deg} are employed in this study.
The numerical results presented in this paper show good agreement with the
experimental results. Fluctuations in the lift and drag coefficients on the
non-actuated airfoil are found to be governed by the vortex shedding frequency.
Provided that the momentum coefficient is sufficiently high, the lift and drag
coefficients tend to fluctuate at the synthetic jet frequency. The mean lift
coefficient linearly increases with the momentum coefficient at a low momentum
coefficient range and its incremental rate begins to decline at a high momentum
coefficient range. Increasing the angle of attack of the airfoil is observed to
slightly reduce the slope of the lift increment.

large the electron transport affects demagnetization on the shortest time

transition in our theory. In the bulk fcc Ni, we find the effect of the spin
transport on the demagnetization is extremely small, no more than 1\%. The
collective electron velocity in Ni is 0.4 $\rm \AA/fs$, much smaller than the
Fermi velocity, and the collective displacement is no more than 0.1 $\rm \AA$.
But this does not mean that electrons do not travel fast; instead we find that
electron velocities at two opposite crystal momenta cancel each other. We
follow the $\Gamma$-X line and find a huge dispersion in the velocities in the
crystal momentum space. In the Fe/W(110) thin film, the overall demagnetization
is larger than Ni, and the Fermi velocity is higher than Ni. However, the
effect of the spin transport is still small in the Fe/W(110) thin film. Based

the form $m \gtrsim \Theta^2 s \times \textit{log factors}$ have been relied on
to determine the minimum number of samples $m$ that guarantees successful
reconstruction of $s$-sparse vectors when the measurement matrix is associated
to an orthonormal system. However, in case of sparse Legendre expansions, the
uniform bound $\Theta$ of Legendre systems is so high that these conditions are
unable to provide meaningful guarantees. In this paper, we present an analysis
which employs the envelop bound of all Legendre polynomials instead, and prove
a new recovery guarantee for $s$-sparse Legendre expansions, $$ m \gtrsim {s^2}

this is the first recovery condition established for orthonormal systems
without assuming the uniform boundedness of the sampling matrix. The key
ingredient of our analysis is an extension of chaining arguments, recently
developed in [Bou14,CDTW15], to handle the envelope bound. Furthermore, our
recovery condition is proved via restricted eigenvalue property, a less
demanding replacement of restricted isometry property which is perfectly suited
to the considered scenario. Along the way, we derive simple criteria to detect
good sample sets. Our numerical tests show that sets of uniformly sampled

where the luminosity is saturating due to photon trapping in the accretion
flow, and be insensitive to the mass accretion rate. In this case, the M_BH

investigate electronic and topological properties of plumbene. Different from
the other two-dimensional (2D) topologically nontrivial insulators in group IVA
(from graphene to stanene), low-buckled plumbene is a topologically trivial
insulator. The plumbene without spin-orbit coupling exhibits simultaneously two
kinds of degeneracies, i.e., quadratic non-Dirac and linear Dirac band
dispersions around the \Gamma and K/K' points, respectively. Our TB model
calculations show that it is the coupling between the two topological states
around the \Gamma and K/K' points that triggers the global topologically
trivial property of plumbene. Quantum anomalous Hall effects with Chern numbers
of 2 or -2 can be, however, achieved after an exchange field is introduced.
When the plumbene is functionalized with ethynyl (PbC2H), quantum spin Hall
effects appear due to the breaking of the coupling effect of the local
topological states.

Machine Learning (ML). Nowadays, it is common to see industrial-strength
machine learning jobs that involve millions of model parameters, terabytes of
training data, and weeks of training. Good efficiency, i.e., fast completion
time of running a specific ML job, therefore, is a key feature of a successful
ML system. While the completion time of a long-running ML job is determined by
the time required to reach model convergence, practically that is also largely
influenced by the values of various system settings. In this paper, we
contribute techniques towards building self-tuning parameter servers. Parameter
Server (PS) is a popular system architecture for large-scale machine learning
systems; and by self-tuning we mean while a long-running ML job is iteratively
training the expert-suggested model, the system is also iteratively learning
which system setting is more efficient for that job and applies it online.
While our techniques are general enough to various PS-style ML systems, we have
prototyped our techniques on top of TensorFlow. Experiments show that our
techniques can reduce the completion times of a variety of long-running
TensorFlow jobs from 1.4x to 18x.

retrieve a person's images from an image dataset, given one image of the person
of interest. For learning robust person features, the pose variation of person
images is one of the key challenges. Existing works targeting the problem
either perform human alignment, or learn human-region-based representations.
Extra pose information and computational cost is generally required for
inference. To solve this issue, a Feature Distilling Generative Adversarial
Network (FD-GAN) is proposed for learning identity-related and pose-unrelated
representations. It is a novel framework based on a Siamese structure with
multiple novel discriminators on human poses and identities. In addition to the
discriminators, a novel same-pose loss is also integrated, which requires
appearance of a same person's generated images to be similar. After learning
pose-unrelated person features with pose guidance, no auxiliary pose
information and additional computational cost is required during testing. Our
proposed FD-GAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on three person reID
datasets, which demonstrates that the effectiveness and robust feature

problem in NLP research. This task enables many potential applications such as
question answering and paraphrase identification. This paper proposes Co-Stack
Residual Affinity Networks (CSRAN), a new and universal neural architecture for
this problem. CSRAN is a deep architecture, involving stacked (multi-layered)
recurrent encoders. Stacked/Deep architectures are traditionally difficult to
train, due to the inherent weaknesses such as difficulty with feature
propagation and vanishing gradients. CSRAN incorporates two novel components to
take advantage of the stacked architecture. Firstly, it introduces a new
bidirectional alignment mechanism that learns affinity weights by fusing
sequence pairs across stacked hierarchies. Secondly, it leverages a multi-level
attention refinement component between stacked recurrent layers. The key
intuition is that, by leveraging information across all network hierarchies, we
can not only improve gradient flow but also improve overall performance. We
conduct extensive experiments on six well-studied text sequence matching
datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on all.

34 M-class, 48 C- and B-class flares. The occurrence rate of white-light flares
(WLFs) is 100\% (8/8) for X-class CFs, $\sim$62\% (21/34) for M-class CFs, and
$\sim$8\% (4/48) for C- and B-class CFs. Sometimes we observe several CFs in a
single AR, and nearly all of them are WLFs. Compared to normal CFs, CFs with
white-light enhancement tend to have a shorter duration, smaller size, stronger
electric current and more complicated magnetic field. We find that for X-class
WLFs, the white-light enhancement is positively correlated with the flare
class, implying that the white-light enhancement is largely determined by the
amount of released energy. However, there is no such correlation for M- and
C-class WLFs, suggesting that other factors such as the time scale, spatial
scale and magnetic field complexity may play important roles in the generation
of white-light emission if the released energy is not high enough.

provides mathematical guarantees on the optimality of the higher-order

framework quantitatively for three important applications including (i)

the approach achieves a mean improvement of 43x over all methods and graphs for

including regularization, interpretability of the components, missing data

even parsimony for SPLS based models-, account for a common use of these
extensions by statisticians who usually select their hyperparameters using
cross-validation. Secondly, they are almost always featured in benchmarking
studies to assess the performance of a new estimation technique used in a high

a vast simulation study to evaluate more than a dozen of potential
cross-validation criteria, either AUC or prediction error based. Several of
them lead to the selection of a reasonable number of components. Using these
newly found cross-validation criteria to fit extensions of partial least

due to its potential role as a molecular building block in the formation of
precursor biomolecules relevant for the origin of life. Its formation, whether
on the surfaces of the interstellar grains or in the gas phase, is currently
debated. The present article presents new theoretical quantum chemical
computations on possible NH2CHO formation routes in water-rich amorphous ices,
simulated by a 33-H2O-molecule cluster. We have considered three possible
routes. The first one refers to a scenario used in several current
astrochemical models, that is, the radical-radical association reaction between
NH2 and HCO. Our calculations show that formamide can indeed be formed, but in
competition with formation of NH3 and CO through a direct H transfer process.
The final outcome of the NH2 + HCO reactivity depends on the relative
orientation of the two radicals on the ice surface. We then analyzed two other
possibilities, suggested here for the first time: reaction of either HCN or CN
with water molecules of the ice mantle. The reaction with HCN has been found to
be characterized by large energy barriers and, therefore, cannot occur under
the interstellar ice conditions. On the contrary, the reaction with the CN
radical can occur, possibly leading through multiple steps to the formation of
NH2CHO. For this reaction, water molecules of the ice act as catalytic active
sites since they help the H transfers involved in the process, thus reducing
the energy barriers (compared to the gas-phase analogous reaction).
Additionally, we apply a statistical model to estimate the reaction rate
coefficient when considering the cluster of 33-H2O-molecules as an isolated
moiety with respect to the surrounding environment, i.e., the rest of the ice.

signalling load leads to network congestion, degradation in the network KPIs.
The classical way to tackle the signalling is by network expansion. However,
this approach is not efficient in terms of capital expenditure (CAPEX) and also
in terms of efficient utilization of the network resources. More specifically,
the signaling domain becomes overloaded while the data domain are
underutilized. In this paper, two UMTS air-interface features; Cell-PCH (paging

large scale storage system. Our motivation is to design flexible and practical
erasure codes with high fault-tolerance to improve data durability and
availability even in catastrophic scenarios. By flexible and practical, we mean
code settings that can be adapted to future requirements and practical
implementations with reasonable trade-offs between security, resource usage and
performance. The codes have three parameters. Alpha increases storage overhead
linearly but increases the possible paths to recover data exponentially. Two
other parameters increase fault-tolerance even further without the need of
additional storage. As a result, an entangled storage system can provide high
availability, durability and offer additional integrity: it is more difficult
to modify data undetectably. We evaluate how several redundancy schemes perform
in unreliable environments and show that alpha entanglement codes are flexible
and practical codes. Remarkably, they excel at code locality, hence, they
reduce repair costs and become less dependent on storage locations with poor
availability. Our solution outperforms Reed-Solomon codes in many disaster
recovery scenarios.

  D",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.98.084026",,"astro-ph.HE gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Some modified theories of gravity are known to predict monopolar, in addition
to the usual quadrupolar and beyond, gravitational radiation in the form of
`breathing' modes. For the same reason that octupole and higher-multipole terms
often contribute negligibly to the overall wave strain, monopole terms tend to
dominate. We investigate both monopolar and quadrupolar continuous
gravitational radiation from neutron stars deformed through internal magnetic
stresses. We adopt the Parameterised-Post-Newtonian formalism to write down
equations describing the leading-order stellar properties in a
theory-independent way, and derive some exact solutions for stars with mixed
poloidal-toroidal magnetic fields. We then turn to the specific case of
scalar-tensor theories to demonstrate how observational upper limits on the
gravitational-wave luminosity of certain neutron stars may be used to place
constraints on modified gravity parameters, most notably the Eddington
parameter $\gamma$. For conservative, purely poloidal models with
characteristic field strength given by the spindown minimum, upper limits for
the Vela pulsar yield $1-\gamma \lesssim 4.2 \times 10^{-3}$. For models
containing a strong toroidal field housing $\sim 99\%$ of the internal magnetic
energy, we obtain the bound $1- \gamma \lesssim 8.0 \times 10^{-7}$. This
latter bound is an order of magnitude tighter than those obtained from current
Solar system experiments, though applies to the strong-field regime.

descent (SGD) wherein data is farmed out to a set of workers, the results of

Although such synchronized SGD approaches parallelize well in idealized
computing environments, they often fail to realize their promised computational
acceleration in practical settings. One cause is slow workers, termed
stragglers, who can cause the fusion step at the master node to stall, which
greatly slowing convergence. In many straggler mitigation approaches work
completed by these nodes, while only partial, is discarded completely. In this
paper, we propose an approach to parallelizing synchronous SGD that exploits
the work completed by all workers. The central idea is to fix the computation
time of each worker and then to combine distinct contributions of all workers.
We provide a convergence analysis and optimize the combination function. Our

zero-point effects: a discontinuous jump, caused by major modifications of the

this area has evolved from the \r{ho}rand algorithm requiring prior knowledge
of the number of active secondary users (SUs) to the musical chair (MC)
algorithm where the number of SUs are unknown and estimated independently at
each SU. These works ignore the number of collisions in the network leading to
wastage of power and bring down the effective life of battery operated SUs. In
this paper, we develop algorithms for OSA that learn faster and incurs fewer
number of collisions i.e. energy efficient. We consider two types of
infrastructure-less decentralized networks: 1) static network where the number
of SUs are fixed but unknown, and 2) dynamic network where SUs can
independently enter or leave the network. We set up the problem as a
multi-player mult-armed bandit and develop two distributed algorithms. The
analysis shows that when all the SUs independently implement the proposed
algorithms, the loss in throughput compared to the optimal throughput, i.e.
regret, is a constant with high probability and significantly outperforms
existing algorithms both in terms of regret and number of collisions. Fewer
collisions make them ideally suitable for battery operated SU terminals. We
validate our claims through exhaustive simulated experiments as well as through
a realistic USRP based experiments in a real radio environment.

The semi-parametric Cox model is widely used to study different types of data
arising from applied disciplines like medical science, biology, reliability
studies and many more. A fully parametric version of the Cox regression model,
if properly specified, can yield more efficient parameter estimates leading to
better insight generation. However, the existing maximum likelihood approach of
generating inference under the fully parametric Cox regression model is highly
non-robust against data-contamination which restricts its practical usage. In
this paper we develop a robust estimation procedure for the parametric Cox
regression model based on the minimum density power divergence approach. The
proposed minimum density power divergence estimator is seen to produce highly
robust estimates under data contamination with only a slight loss in efficiency
under pure data. Further, they are always seen to generate more precise
inference than the likelihood based estimates under the semi-parametric Cox
models or their existing robust versions. We also sketch the derivation of the
asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator using the martingale approach
and justify their robustness theoretically through the influence function

on unitary evolutions or measurement feedforward operations. However, these
existing schemes require accurate pulse operations and/or precise timing
controls. Here, we propose a one-way transfer of the quantum state with near
unit efficiency using dissipation from a tailored environment. After preparing
an initial state, the transfer can be implemented without external time
dependent operations. Moreover, our scheme is irreversible due to the
non-unitary evolution, and so the transferred state remains in the same site
once the system reaches the steady state. This is in stark contrast to the
unitary state transfer where the quantum states continue to oscillate between
different sites. Our novel quantum state transfer via the dissipation paves the
way towards robust and practical quantum control.

bipartite systems directly from tomograms, as it is the latter that are readily
obtained from experiments. This would provide a superior alternative to the
standard procedure of assessing the extent of entanglement between subsystems
after employing the machinery of state reconstruction from the tomogram. The
latter is both cumbersome and involves statistical methods, while a direct
inference about entanglement from the tomogram circumvents these limitations.
In an earlier paper, we had identified a procedure to obtain a bipartite
entanglement indicator directly from tomograms. To assess the efficacy of this
indicator, we now carry out a detailed investigation using two nonlinear
bipartite models by comparing this tomographic indicator with standard markers
of entanglement such as the subsystem linear entropy and the subsystem von
Neumann entropy and also with a commonly-used indicator obtained from inverse
participation ratios. The two model systems selected for this purpose are a
multilevel atom interacting with a radiation field, and a double-well
Bose-Einstein condensate. The role played by the specific initial states of
these two systems in the performance of the tomographic indicator is also
examined. Further, the efficiency of the tomographic entanglement indicator
during the dynamical evolution of the system is assessed from a time-series
analysis of the difference between this indicator and the subsystem von Neumann
entropy.

gendered pattern of behavior: We use a random forest prediction of being female
(as opposed to being male) by behavioral choices in the level of activity,
specialization in programming languages, and choice of partners. We test
differences in success and survival along both categorical gender and the
gendered pattern of behavior. We find that 84.5% of women's disadvantage
(compared to men) in success and 34.8% of their disadvantage in survival are
due to the female pattern of their behavior. Men are also disadvantaged along
their interquartile range of the female pattern of their behavior, and users
who don't reveal their gender suffer an even more drastic disadvantage in
survival probability. Moreover, we do not see evidence for any reduction of
these inequalities in time. Our findings are robust to noise in gender
recognition, and to taking into account particular programming languages, or
decision tree classes of gendered behavior. Our results suggest that fighting
categorical gender discrimination will have a limited impact on gender

to damage equipment or degrade a manufactured part's mechanical properties. In

Hamiltonian. The molecules studied range from the smallest one with three
phenyl rings (phenanthrene) to the largest one with nine phenyl rings. These
structures can also be seen as finite-sized hydrogen-passivated armchair
graphene nanoribbons of increasing lengths. Our CI calculations reveal that the
electron-correlation effects have a profound influence not just on the peak
locations, but also on the relative intensity profile of the computed spectra.
We also compare our phenacene results with isomeric oligo-acenes, and find that
in all the cases former have a wider optical gap than the latter. Our results
are found to be in very good agreement with the experiments, where available.

Applications range from understanding the transcriptional and epigenetic
processes involved in metazoan development to characterizing distinct cells
types in heterogeneous populations like cancers or immune cells. However,
analysis of the data is impeded by its unknown intrinsic biological and
technical variability together with its sparseness; these factors complicate
the identification of true biological signals amidst artifact and noise. Here
we show that, across technologies, roughly 95% of the eigenvalues derived from
each single-cell data set can be described by universal distributions predicted
by Random Matrix Theory. Interestingly, 5% of the spectrum shows deviations
from these distributions and present a phenomenon known as eigenvector
localization, where information tightly concentrates in groups of cells. Some
of the localized eigenvectors reflect underlying biological signal, and some
are simply a consequence of the sparsity of single cell data; roughly 3% is
artifactual. Based on the universal distributions and a technique for detecting
sparsity induced localization, we present a strategy to identify the residual
2% of directions that encode biological information and thereby denoise
single-cell data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by
comparing with standard single-cell data analysis techniques in a variety of
examples with marked cell populations.

Earth for various cases [not including the influence of interstellar medium

produced by the GWs of the post-merger stage) above 1.8kHz (typical plasma
frequency around solar system in the Milky way), could propagate through the
ISM from the source until the Earth, and the perturbed ULF-EMWs will be
reprocessed before they arrived at the Earth due to the ISM. Also, the
waveforms of the perturbed ULF-EMWs will be modified into shapes different but
related to the waveforms of the GWs, by the amplification process during the
binary mergers which could amplify the magnetic fields into 10^{12}Tesla or
even higher. Specific connection relationships between the polarizations of the

attractive limit cycle. In this study we pursue the construction of a
biparametric bifurcation diagram for the Tantalus Oscillator under biphasics
perturbations. That is the first time that this kind of diagram is built for
this kind of oscillator under biphasics perturbations. Results show that
biphasic perturbations have no effect when the coupling time is chosen over a
wide range of values. This modifies the bifurcation diagram obtain under
monophasics perturbations. Now we have the appearance of periodic increment Big
Bang Bifurcations. The theoretical results are in excellent agreement with
experimental observations.

  Decomposition","Code and replication data available at
  https://github.com/peterfennell/S3D",,,,"cs.CY physics.data-an physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modeling human behavioral data is challenging due to its scale, sparseness
(few observations per individual), heterogeneity (differently behaving
individuals), and class imbalance (few observations of the outcome of
interest). An additional challenge is learning an interpretable model that not
only accurately predicts outcomes, but also identifies important factors
associated with a given behavior. To address these challenges, we describe a
statistical approach to modeling behavioral data called the structured
sum-of-squares decomposition (S3D). The algorithm, which is inspired by
decision trees, selects important features that collectively explain the
variation of the outcome, quantifies correlations between the features, and
partitions the subspace of important features into smaller, more homogeneous
blocks that correspond to similarly-behaving subgroups within the population.
This partitioned subspace allows us to predict and analyze the behavior of the
outcome variable both statistically and visually, giving a medium to examine
the effect of various features and to create explainable predictions. We apply
S3D to learn models of online activity from large-scale data collected from
diverse sites, such as Stack Exchange, Khan Academy, Twitter, Duolingo, and
Digg. We show that S3D creates parsimonious models that can predict outcomes in
the held-out data at levels comparable to state-of-the-art approaches, but in
addition, produces interpretable models that provide insights into behaviors.
This is important for informing strategies aimed at changing behavior,
designing social systems, but also for explaining predictions, a critical step
towards minimizing algorithmic bias.

of a new class of ferroelectrics or multiferroics among

experimentally verified to possess distorted rutile structures, are
ferroelectric with considerable polarizations(up to 24 muC/cm2) and
piezoelectric coefficients. Their atomic-thick layer may possess vertical
polarization robust against depolarizing field due to the formation of O-H O
bonds that can hardly be symmetrized. Moreover,CrOOH (guyanaite) is revealed to
be a combination of high-Tc in-plane type-I multiferroics and vertical type-II
multiferroics, which is strain-tunable and may render a desirable coupling
between magnetism and ferroelectricity. Supported by experimental evidence on
reversible conversion between metal oxyhydroxides and dioxides and their nice
lattice match that renders convenient epitaxial growth, heterostructure
composed of oxyhydroxides and prevalent metal dioxides (e.g. TiO2, SnO2 and
CrO2) may be constructed for various applications like ferroelectric
