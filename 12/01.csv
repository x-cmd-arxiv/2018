armed bandit (MAB) model under side constraints. The side constraints model
situations in which bandit activations are limited by the availability of
certain resources that are replenished at a constant rate. The main result
involves the derivation of an asymptotic lower bound for the regret of feasible
uniformly fast policies and the construction of policies that achieve this
lower bound, under pertinent conditions. Further, we provide the explicit form
of such policies for the case in which the unknown distributions are Normal
with unknown means and known variances, for the case of Normal distributions
with unknown means and unknown variances and for the case of arbitrary discrete
distributions with finite support.

Mach 4.5 is studied using direct numerical simulations. For a given level of
total disturbance energy, the inflow spectra was designed to correspond to the
nonlinearly most dangerous condition that leads to the earliest possible
transition Reynolds number. The synthesis of the inlet disturbance is
formulated as a constrained optimization, where the control vector is comprised
of the amplitudes and relative phases of the inlet modes; the constraints are
the prescribed total energy and that the flow evolution satisfies the full
nonlinear compressible Navier-Stokes equations; the cost function is the
average wall friction which, once maximized, corresponds to the earliest
possible transition location. An ensemble variational (EnVar) technique is
developed to solve the optimization problem. EnVar updates the estimate of the
control vector at the end of each iteration using the gradient of the cost
function, which is computed from the outcome of an ensemble of possible
solutions. Two inflow conditions are computed, each corresponding to a
different level of energy, and their spectra are contrasted: the lower energy
case includes two normal acoustic waves and one oblique vorticity perturbation,
whereas the higher energy condition consists of oblique acoustic and vorticity
waves. The focus is placed on the former case, where the instability wave that
initiates the rapid breakdown to turbulence is not present at the inlet plane.
Instead, it appears at a downstream location after a series of nonlinear
interactions that spur the fastest onset of turbulence. The results from the
nonlinearly most potent inflow condition are also compared to other inlet
disturbances that are selected solely based on linear theory, and which all
yield relatively delayed transition onset.

accurate reference excitation energies for transitions involving a substantial
amount of double excitation using a series of increasingly large
diffuse-containing atomic basis sets. Our set gathers 20 vertical transitions
from 14 small- and medium-size molecule. Depending on the size of the molecule,
selected configuration interaction (sCI) and/or multiconfigurational
calculations are performed in order to obtain reliable estimates of the
vertical transition energies. In addition, coupled cluster approaches including
at least contributions from iterative triples are assessed. Our results clearly
evidence that the error in CC methods is intimately related to the amount of
double excitation character of the transition. For ""pure"" double excitations
(i.e. for transitions which do not mix with single excitations), the error in
CC3 can easily reach 1 eV, while it goes down to few tenths of an eV for more
common transitions (like in \emph{trans}-butadiene) involving a significant
amount of singles. As expected, CC approaches including quadruples yield highly
accurate results for any type of transitions. The quality of the excitation
energies obtained with multiconfigurational methods is harder to predict. We
have found that the overall accuracy of these methods is highly dependent of
both the system and the selected active space. The inclusion of the $\sigma$

mostly $\pi$ and $\pi^*$ orbitals, is mandatory in order to reach high

increased sensitivity due to reduction of exchange bias. In order to further
increase the sensitivity, we have fabricated PHE sensors for a fixed Pt

bursters with a high persistent luminosity, $4\times 10^{36}\ \mbox{erg

accreting matter settles to the stellar surface mainly in two high-latitude
ring zones. Despite the subsequent spreading of matter over the entire star,
its surface density in these zones turns out to be higher than the average one
by 2-3 orders of magnitude, which determines the predominant ignition
probability. The multiple events whereby the flame after the thermonuclear
explosion in one ring zone (initial burst) propagates through less dense matter
to another zone and initiates a second explosion in it (recurrent burst) make a
certain contribution to the observed excess of the burst rate. However, the
localized explosions of matter in these zones, after which the burning in the
zone rapidly dies out without affecting other zones, make a noticeably larger
contribution to the excess of the burst rate over the expected one.

real observation model mismatches the one used in training. Recently, two
different techniques suggested to mitigate this deficiency, i.e., enjoy the
advantages of deep learning without being restricted by the training phase. The
first one follows the plug-and-play (P&P) approach that solves general inverse
problems (e.g., SR) by using Gaussian denoisers for handling the prior term in
model-based optimization schemes. The second builds on internal recurrence of
information inside a single image, and trains a super-resolver network at test
time on examples synthesized from the low-resolution image. Our work
incorporates these two independent strategies, enjoying the impressive
generalization capabilities of deep learning, captured by the first, and
further improving it through internal learning at test time. First, we apply a
recent P&P strategy to SR. Then, we show how it may become image-adaptive in
test time. This technique outperforms the above two strategies on popular

practical cases where the observation model is inexact or unknown in advance.

A container image usually includes a collection of software packages, that can
have bugs and security vulnerabilities that affect the container health. Our
goal is to support container deployers by analysing the relation between
outdated containers and vulnerable and buggy packages installed in them. We use
the concept of technical lag of a container as the difference between a given
container and the most up-to-date container that is possible with the most
recent releases of the same collection of packages. For 7,380 official and
community Docker images that are based on the Debian Linux distribution, we
identify which software packages are installed in them and measure their
technical lag in terms of version updates, security vulnerabilities and bugs.
We have found, among others, that no release is devoid of vulnerabilities, so
deployers cannot avoid vulnerabilities even if they deploy the most recent
packages. We offer some lessons learned for container developers in regard to
the strategies they can follow to minimize the number of vulnerabilities. We
argue that Docker container scan and security management tools should improve
their platforms by adding data about other kinds of bugs and include the
measurement of technical lag to offer deployers information of when to update.

versatile applications. The majority of experiments have been performed with
nanopores being in contact with the same electrolyte on both sides of the
membrane, while solution gradients across semi-permeable membranes are
omnipresent in natural systems. In this manuscript, we studied ionic and
fluidic movement through thin nanopores under viscosity gradients both
experimentally and using simulations. Ionic current rectification was observed
under these conditions, due to solutions with different conductivities filled
across the pore under different biases caused by electroosmotic flow. We found
that a pore filled with high viscosity solutions exhibited current increase
with applied voltage in a steeper slope beyond a threshold voltage, which
abnormally reduced the current rectification ratio. Through simulations, we
found reversed electroosmotic flow that filled the pore with aqueous solutions
of lower viscosities was responsible for this behavior. The reversed
electroosmotic flow could be explained by slower depletion of coions than
counterions along the pore. By increasing the surface charge density of pore
surfaces, current rectification ratio could reach the value of the viscosity
gradient across thin nanopores. Our findings shed light on fundamental aspects
to be considered when performing experiments with viscosity gradients across
nanopores and nanofluidic channels.

  Dialogue Systems","NIPS CONVAI Workshop 2018",,,,"cs.AI cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Goal-oriented dialogue systems typically rely on components specifically
developed for a single task or domain. This limits such systems in two
different ways: If there is an update in the task domain, the dialogue system
usually needs to be updated or completely re-trained. It is also harder to
extend such dialogue systems to different and multiple domains. The dialogue
state tracker in conventional dialogue systems is one such component - it is
usually designed to fit a well-defined application domain. For example, it is
common for a state variable to be a categorical distribution over a
manually-predefined set of entities (Henderson et al., 2013), resulting in an
inflexible and hard-to-extend dialogue system. In this paper, we propose a new
approach for dialogue state tracking that can generalize well over multiple
domains without incorporating any domain-specific knowledge. Under this
framework, discrete dialogue state variables are learned independently and the
information of a predefined set of possible values for dialogue state variables
is not required. Furthermore, it enables adding arbitrary dialogue context as
features and allows for multiple values to be associated with a single state
variable. These characteristics make it much easier to expand the dialogue
state space. We evaluate our framework using the widely used dialogue state
tracking challenge data set (DSTC2) and show that our framework yields
competitive results with other state-of-the-art results despite incorporating
little domain knowledge. We also show that this framework can benefit from
widely available external resources such as pre-trained word embeddings.

for layer formation of bottom-heavy swimming algae cells, especially in flows
where the vorticity varies linearly with depth (Durham, Stocker & Kessler,
Science, vol. 323, 2009, pp. 1067-1070). Using a continuum model for dilute
microswimmer suspensions, we report that an instability of a gyrotactically
trapped cell-layer can arise in a pressure-driven plane channel flow. The
linear stability analysis reveals that the equilibrium cell-layer solution is
hydrodynamically unstable due to negative microswimmer buoyancy (i.e. a
gravitational instability) over a range of biologically relevant parameter
values. The critical cell concentration for this instability is found to be
$N_c\simeq 10^4\textrm{cells}/\textrm{cm}^{3}$, a value comparable to the
typical maximum cell concentration observed in thin layers. This result
indicates that the instability may be a potential mechanism for limiting the
layer's maximum cell concentration, especially in regions where turbulence is
weak, and motivates the study of its nonlinear evolution, perhaps, in the
presence of turbulence.

  Semi-supervision","NIPS CONVAI Workshop 2018",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As open-ended human-chatbot interaction becomes commonplace, sensitive
content detection gains importance. In this work, we propose a two stage
semi-supervised approach to bootstrap large-scale data for automatic sensitive
language detection from publicly available web resources. We explore various
data selection methods including 1) using a blacklist to rank online discussion
forums by the level of their sensitiveness followed by randomly sampling
utterances and 2) training a weakly supervised model in conjunction with the
blacklist for scoring sentences from online discussion forums to curate a
dataset. Our data collection strategy is flexible and allows the models to
detect implicit sensitive content for which manual annotations may be
difficult. We train models using publicly available annotated datasets as well
as using the proposed large-scale semi-supervised datasets. We evaluate the
performance of all the models on Twitter and Toxic Wikipedia comments testsets
as well as on a manually annotated spoken language dataset collected during a
large scale chatbot competition. Results show that a model trained on this
collected data outperforms the baseline models by a large margin on both
in-domain and out-of-domain testsets, achieving an F1 score of 95.5% on an
out-of-domain testset compared to a score of 75% for models trained on public
datasets. We also showcase that large scale two stage semi-supervision
generalizes well across multiple classes of sensitivities such as hate speech,
racism, sexual and pornographic content, etc. without even providing explicit
labels for these classes, leading to an average recall of 95.5% versus the
models trained using annotated public datasets which achieve an average recall
of 73.2% across seven sensitive classes on out-of-domain testsets.

on-demand instance where the job is guaranteed to be completed, and ii) the
{\em cheap} spot instance where a job may be interrupted. We consider a user
can select a combination of on-demand and spot instances to finish a task. Thus
he needs to find the optimal bidding price for the spot-instance, and the
portion of the job to be run on the on-demand instance. We formulate the
problem as an optimization problem and seek to find the optimal solution. We
consider three bidding strategies: one-time requests with expected guarantee
and one-time requests with penalty for incomplete job and violating the
deadline, and persistent requests. Even without a penalty on incomplete jobs,
the optimization problem turns out to be non-convex. Nevertheless, we show that
the portion of the job to be run on the on-demand instance is at most half. If
the job has a higher execution time or smaller deadline, the bidding price is
higher and vice versa. Additionally, the user never selects the on-demand
instance if the execution time is smaller than the deadline.
  The numerical results illustrate the sensitivity of the effective portfolio
to several of the parameters involved in the model. Our empirical analysis on
the Amazon EC2 data shows that our strategies can be employed on the real
instances, where the expected total cost of the proposed scheme decreases over
45\% compared to the baseline strategy.

interface, by means of numerical simulations and theoretical arguments. The
slider, which moves by definition towards the interface minima, is active as it
also stimulates growth of the interface. Even though such a particle has no
counterpart in thermodynamic systems, active sliders may provide a simple model
for ATP-dependent membrane proteins that activate cytoskeletal growth. We find
a wide range of dynamical regimes according to the ratio between the timescales
associated with the slider motion and the interface relaxation. If the
interface dynamics is slow, the slider behaves like a random walker in a random
envinronment which, furthermore, is able to escape environmental troughs by
making them grow. This results in different dynamic exponens to the interface
and the particle: the former behaves as an Edward-Wilkinson surface with
dynamic exponent 2 whereas the latter has dynamic exponent 3/2. When the
interface is fast, we get sustained ballistic motion with the particle surfing
a membrane wave created by itself. However, if the interface relaxes
immediately (i.e., it is infinitely fast), particle motion becomes symmetric
and goes back to diffusive. Due to such a rich phenomenology, we propose the
active slider as a toy model of fundamental interest in the field of active
membranes and, generally, whenever the system constituent can alter the
environment by spending energy.

between the architectural design of the system as it ""should be"" compared to
""as it is"". We measured architecture debt in two ways: 1) in terms of
system-wide coupling measures, and 2) in terms of the number and severity of
architectural flaws. In recent work it was shown that the amount of
architectural debt has a huge impact on software maintainability and evolution.
Consequently, detecting and reducing the debt is expected to make software more
amenable to change. This paper reports on a longitudinal study of a healthcare
communications product created by Brightsquid Secure Communications Corp. This
start-up company is facing the typical trade-off problem of desiring
responsiveness to change requests, but wanting to avoid the ever-increasing
effort that the accumulation of quick-and-dirty changes eventually incurs. In
the first stage of the study, we analyzed the status of the ""before"" system,
which indicated the impacts of change requests. This initial study motivated a
more in-depth analysis of architectural debt. The results of this analysis were
used to motivate a comprehensive refactoring of the software system. The third
phase of the study was a follow-on architectural debt analysis which quantified
the improvements made. Using this quantitative evidence, augmented by
qualitative evidence gathered from in-depth interviews with Brightsquid's
architects, we present lessons learned about the costs and benefits of paying
down architecture debt in practice.

gravity. Contrary to previous discrete approaches, this model is defined on
(regular) random graphs and is driven by a purely combinatorial version of
Ricci curvature, the Ollivier curvature, defined on generic metric spaces
equipped with a Markov chain. It dispenses thus of notions such as simplicial
complexes and Regge calculus and is ideally suited to extend quantum gravity to
combinatorial structures which have a priori nothing to do with geometry.
Indeed, our results show that geometry and general relativity emerge from
random structures in a second-order phase transition due to the condensation of
cycles on random graphs, a critical point that defines quantum gravity
non-perturbatively according to asymptotic safety. In combinatorial quantum
gravity the entropy area law emerges naturally as a consequence of
infinite-dimensional critical behaviour on networks rather than on lattices. We
propose thus that the entropy area law is a signature of the random graph
nature of space-(time) on the smallest scales.

time and the context in which the action is applied. The same action with the
same effects in a different context or states can cause a different change. In
actions with incomplete precondition list, that applicable in several states
and circumstances, ambiguity regarding the impact of the action is challenging
even in small domains. To estimate the real impact of actions, an evaluation of
the effect list will not be enough; a relative estimation is more informative
and suitable for estimation of action's real impact. Recent work on
Over-subscription Planning (OSP) defined the net utility of action as the net
change in the state's value caused by the action. The notion of net utility of
action allows for a broader perspective on value action impact and use for a
more accurate evaluation of achievements of the action, considering inter-state
and intra-state dependencies. To achieve value-rational decisions in complex
reality often requires strategic, high level, planning with a global
perspective and values, while many local tactical decisions require real-time
information to estimate the impact of actions. This paper proposes an offline
action-value structure analysis to exploit the compactly represented
informativeness of net utility of actions to extend the scope of planning to
value uncertainty scenarios and to provide a real-time value-rational decision
planning tool. The result of the offline pre-processing phase is a compact
decision planning model representation for flexible, local reasoning of net
utility of actions with (offline) value ambiguity. The obtained flexibility is
beneficial for the online planning phase and real-time execution of actions
with value ambiguity. Our empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of this
approach in domains with value ambiguity in their action-value-structure.

regarding the epoch of Cosmic Dawn. A second order effect in the fluid
equations was recently found to make a significant contribution: an offset
velocity between gas and dark matter, the so-called streaming velocity.
Previous simulations of a limited number of low-mass dark matter haloes suggest
that this streaming velocity can delay the formation of the first stars and
decrease halo gas fractions and the halo mass function in the low mass regime.
However, a systematic exploration of its effects in a large sample of haloes
has been lacking until now. In this paper, we present results from a set of
cosmological simulations of regions of the Universe with different streaming
velocities performed with the moving mesh code AREPO. Our simulations have very
high mass resolution, enabling us to accurately resolve minihaloes as small as
$10^5 \: {\rm M_{\odot}}$. We show that in the absence of streaming, the least
massive halo that contains cold gas has a mass $M_{\rm halo, min} = 5 \times
10^{5} \: {\rm M_{\odot}}$, but that cooling only becomes efficient in a
majority of haloes for halo masses greater than $M_{\rm halo,50\%} = 1.6 \times
10^6 \: {\rm M_{\odot}}$. In regions with non-zero streaming velocities,
$M_{\rm halo, min}$ and $M_{\rm halo,50\%}$ both increase significantly, by
around a factor of a few for each one sigma increase in the value of the local
streaming velocity. As a result, in regions with streaming velocities
$v_\mathrm{stream} \ge 3\,\sigma_\mathrm{rms}$, cooling of gas in minihaloes is
completely suppressed, implying that the first stars in these regions form
within atomic cooling haloes.

quartet-metric/multi-component gravity, a theory of a massive scalar graviton
supplementing the massless tensor one is consistently deduced. The
peculiarities of the scalar-graviton field compared to the canonical scalar one
are demonstrated. The light scalar graviton is treated as an emergent dark
substance of the Universe: dark matter and/or dark energy depending on the
solution. The case with scalar graviton as dark energy responsible for the
late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe is studied in more detail. In
particular, it is shown that due to an attractor solution for the light scalar
graviton there naturally emerges at the classical level a tiny nonzero
effective cosmological constant, even in the absence of the Lagrangian one. The
prospects of going beyond LCDM model per scalar graviton are shortly indicated.

  Vehicular Networks",,,,,"cs.DC cs.IT cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The demand for real-time cloud applications has seen an unprecedented growth
over the past decade. These applications require rapidly data transfer and fast
computations. This paper considers a scenario where multiple IoT devices update
information on the cloud, and request a computation from the cloud at certain
times. The time required to complete the request for computation includes the
time to wait for computation to start on busy virtual machines, performing the
computation, waiting and service in the networking stage for delivering the
output to the end user. In this context, the freshness of the information is an
important concern and is different from the completion time. This paper
proposes novel scheduling strategies for both computation and networking
stages. Based on these strategies, the age-of-information (AoI) metric and the
completion time are characterized. A convex combination of the two metrics is
optimized over the scheduling parameters. The problem is shown to be convex and
thus can be solved optimally. Moreover, based on the offline policy, an online
algorithm for job scheduling is developed. Numerical results demonstrate
significant improvement as compared to the considered baselines.

  Tennis Through Self-Play",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Training robots with physical bodies requires developing new methods and
action representations that allow the learning agents to explore the space of
policies efficiently. This work studies sample-efficient learning of complex
policies in the context of robot table tennis. It incorporates learning into a
hierarchical control framework using a model-free strategy layer (which
requires complex reasoning about opponents that is difficult to do in a
model-based way), model-based prediction of external objects (which are
difficult to control directly with analytic control methods, but governed by
learnable and relatively simple laws of physics), and analytic controllers for
the robot itself. Human demonstrations are used to train dynamics models, which
together with the analytic controller allow any robot that is physically
capable to play table tennis without training episodes. Using only about 7,000
demonstrated trajectories, a striking policy can hit ball targets with about 20
cm error. Self-play is used to train cooperative and adversarial strategies on
top of model-based striking skills trained from human demonstrations. After
only about 24,000 strikes in self-play the agent learns to best exploit the
human dynamics models for longer cooperative games. Further experiments
demonstrate that more flexible variants of the policy can discover new strikes
not demonstrated by humans and achieve higher performance at the expense of
lower sample-efficiency. Experiments are carried out in a virtual reality
environment using sensory observations that are obtainable in the real world.
The high sample-efficiency demonstrated in the evaluations show that the
proposed method is suitable for learning directly on physical robots without
transfer of models or policies from simulation.

phenomenological population models using the ten binary black hole mergers
detected in the first and second observing runs completed by Advanced LIGO and
Advanced Virgo. We constrain properties of the binary black hole (BBH) mass
spectrum using models with a range of parameterizations of the BBH mass and
spin distributions. We find that the mass distribution of the more massive
black hole in such binaries is well approximated by models with no more than 1%
of black holes more massive than $45\,M_\odot$, and a power law index of
$\alpha = {1.3}^{+1.4}_{-1.7}$ (90% credibility). We also show that BBHs are
unlikely to be composed of black holes with large spins aligned to the orbital
angular momentum. Modelling the evolution of the BBH merger rate with redshift,
we show that it is at or increasing with redshift with 93% probability.
Marginalizing over uncertainties in the BBH population, we find robust
estimates of the BBH merger rate density of $R = {53.2}^{+55.8}_{-28.2}$
Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ (90% credibility). As the BBH catalog grows in future
observing runs, we expect that uncertainties in the population model parameters
will shrink, potentially providing insights into the formation of black holes
via supernovae, binary interactions of massive stars, stellar cluster dynamics,
and the formation history of black holes across cosmic time.

  Gradient Descent",,,,,"cs.LG cs.DC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Increasing the mini-batch size for stochastic gradient descent offers
significant opportunities to reduce wall-clock training time, but there are a
variety of theoretical and systems challenges that impede the widespread
success of this technique. We investigate these issues, with an emphasis on
time to convergence and total computational cost, through an extensive
empirical analysis of network training across several architectures and problem
domains, including image classification, image segmentation, and language
modeling. Although it is common practice to increase the batch size in order to
fully exploit available computational resources, we find a substantially more
nuanced picture. Our main finding is that across a wide range of network
architectures and problem domains, increasing the batch size beyond a certain
point yields no decrease in wall-clock time to convergence for \emph{either}
train or test loss. This batch size is usually substantially below the capacity
of current systems. We show that popular training strategies for large batch
size optimization begin to fail before we can populate all available compute
resources, and we show that the point at which these methods break down depends
more on attributes like model architecture and data complexity than it does
directly on the size of the dataset.

emission and multiple dust continuum measurements in a sample of ""normal""

emission from a Lyman Break Galaxy, at $z\sim5.7$. The CO line luminosity
implies a massive molecular gas reservoir of $(1.3\pm0.3)(\alpha_{\rm
CO}/4.5\,M_\odot$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2)^{-1})\times10^{11}\,M_\odot$,
suggesting low star formation efficiency, with a gas depletion timescale of
order $\sim$1 Gyr. This efficiency is much lower than traditionally observed in
$z\gtrsim5$ starbursts, indicating that star forming conditions in Main
Sequence galaxies at $z\sim6$ may be comparable to those of normal galaxies
probed up to $z\sim3$ to-date, but with rising gas fractions across the entire
redshift range. We also obtain a deep CO upper limit for a Main Sequence galaxy
at $z\sim5.3$ with $\sim3$ times lower SFR, perhaps implying a high
$\alpha_{\rm CO}$ conversion factor, as typically found in low metallicity
galaxies. For a sample including both CO targets, we also find faint [N II]
205$\,\mu$m emission relative to [C II] in all but the most IR-luminous
""normal"" galaxies at $z=5-6$, implying more intense or harder radiation fields
in the ionized gas relative to lower redshift. These radiation properties
suggest that low metallicity may be common in typical $\sim$10$^{10}\,M_\odot$
galaxies at $z=5-6$. While a fraction of Main Sequence star formation in the
first billion years may take place in conditions not dissimilar to lower
redshift, lower metallicity may affect the remainder of the population.

planetary nebula, while our observations show that it is a massive B0.5 Ib
star, possibly in a binary system. Using the stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND,
we derived fundamental parameters of the three stars as well as their surface
element abundances, implying that all of them are either on the main sequence
or only recently left it. This provides further evidence that massive stars can
produce circumstellar nebulae while they are still relatively unevolved. We
also report the detection of optical counterparts to the mid-infrared nebulae
and a second, more extended optical nebula around ALS 19653, and present the
results of SALT spectroscopy of both nebulae associated with this star. The

high redshift galaxies and, due to the short lifetimes of interstellar grains,
in dust replenishment of local galaxies. Here we explore how SN dust yields
depend on the mass, metallicity, and rotation rate of the progenitor stars, and
on the properties of the explosion. To this aim, assuming uniform mixing inside
the ejecta, we quantify the dust mass produced by a sample of SN models with
progenitor masses $13~M_{\odot} \leq M \leq 120~M_{\odot}$, metallicity $\rm -3
\leq [Fe/H] \leq 0$, rotation rate $\rm v_{\rm rot} = 0$ and $300$~km/s, that
explode with a fixed energy of $1.2 \times 10^{51}$~erg (FE models) or with
explosion properties calibrated to reproduce the $\rm ^{56}Ni$ - $M$ relation
inferred from SN observations (CE models). We find that rotation favours more
efficient dust production, particularly for more massive, low metallicity
stars, but that metallicity and explosion properties have the largest effects
on the dust mass and its composition. In FE models, SNe with $M \leq 20 - 25
~M_{\odot}$ are more efficient at forming dust: between 0.1 and 1 $M_\odot$ is
formed in a single explosion, with a composition dominated by silicates, carbon
and magnetite grains when $\rm [Fe/H] = 0$, and by carbon and magnetite grains
when $\rm [Fe/H] < 0$. In CE models, the ejecta are massive and metal-rich and
dust production is more efficient. The dust mass increases with $M$ and it is
dominated by silicates, at all [Fe/H].

critical for studying the disruption of stellar clusters in a cosmological
context. We systematically characterise the response of stellar clusters to
tidal shocks using controlled N-body simulations of clusters with various
properties that are subjected to different types of shocks. We find that the
strength of the shock and the density of the cluster within the half-mass
radius are the dominant properties that drive the amount of mass lost by the
cluster, with the shape of the cluster profile being of minor influence. When
the shock is applied as two separate sub-shocks, the amount of mass loss during
the second sub-shock is sensitive to the gap time between them. Clusters that
experience successive sub-shocks separated by less than their crossing time
attain the same masses and sizes at the end of the simulation. However,
clusters subjected to sub-shocks separated by more than a crossing time
experience different evolutionary histories. The amount of mass lost in the
N-body models and its scaling with shock and cluster properties differs from
that predicted by classical tidal disruption theory. We demonstrate that the
discrepancy is alleviated by including a dependence on the escape time-scale of
unbound stars, analogously to mass loss driven by two-body relaxation. With our
new theoretical model for shock-driven mass loss, the predicted relative
amounts of mass loss agree with the results of the N-body simulations to ~0.3

on the influence of the out-of-phase current in the regime where the ionic

surface conductance and no frequency-dependent surface capacitance. Hence, the
frequency dispersion of the dielectric constant is dominated by the effect of
neutral currents outside the electric double layer. In the thin double-layer
limit, we use Fixman's boundary condition at the outer surface of the double
layer to capture interaction between the electric field and the flow of the
ions. For periodic conditions, we combine the methods developed by Lord
Rayleigh for understanding the electric conduction across rectangularly
arranged obstacles and by Korringa, Kohn and Rostoker for the electronic band
structure computation. When the charged spheres occupy a very small volume
fraction, smaller than one percent, our solution becomes consistent with the
Maxwell Garnett mixing formula together with the single-particle polarization
response, as expected, because inter-particle interactions become less
prominent in the dilute limit. By contrast, the inter-particle interaction
greatly alters the dielectric response even when charged spheres occupy only
two percent of the volume. We found that the characteristic frequency shifts to
a higher value compared to that derived from the single-particle polarization
response. At the same time, the low-frequency dielectric enhancement, a
signature of charged spheres immersed in an electrolyte, becomes less prominent
for the periodic array of charged spheres. Our results imply that the signature
of the dielectric response of a system consisting of densely packed charged

strong dependence on galactocentric radius because of the lack of variation in
HI surface density and HI velocity dispersion. Then, we consider the energies
injected by supernovae (SNe), the magneto-rotational instability (MRI), and the
gravity-driven turbulence from accreted materials as the sources of turbulent
energy. For a constant dissipation time of turbulence, the SNe energy can
maintain turbulence inside $\sim 4$ kpc radius (equivalent to $\sim
0.5~R_{25}$), while the MRI energy is always smaller than the turbulent energy
within 8 kpc radius. However, when we let the dissipation time to be equal to
the crossing time of turbulence across the HI scale-height, the SNe energy is
enough to maintain turbulence out to 7 kpc radius, and the sum of SNe and MRI
energies is able to maintain turbulence out to 8 kpc radius. Due to lack of
constraint in the mass accretion rate through the disk of M33, we can not rule
out the accretion driven turbulence as a possible source of energy.
Furthermore, by resolving individual Giant Molecular Clouds in M33, we also

clouds with $\sim 1\%$ of coupling efficiency. This result strengthens the
proposition that stellar feedback is an important source of energy to maintain

deviations from equilibrium of ionization, the deviation from

synthesize both thermal X-ray and non-thermal radio emission and compare the

field reduces the erosion and fragmentation of the dense equatorial ring after
the impact of the SN blast wave. As a result, the ring survives the passage of
the blast, at least, during the time covered by the simulations (40 years). Our
model is able to reproduce the morphology and lightcurves of SN 1987A in both

flux originating from the reverse shock is heavily suppressed. In this case,
the radio emission originates mostly from the forward shock traveling through
the H II region. Possible mechanisms for the suppression of emission from the
reverse shock are investigated. We find that synchrotron self-absorption and
free-free absorption have negligible effects on the emission during the

increasing the proportion of women of reproductive age using modern methods. To
measure progress toward such goals in populous countries like Nigeria, it's
essential to characterize the current levels and trends of FP indicators such
as unmet need and modern contraceptive prevalence rates (mCPR). Moreover, the
substantial heterogeneity across Nigeria and scale of programmatic
implementation requires a sub-national resolution of these FP indicators.
However, significant challenges face estimating FP indicators sub-nationally in
Nigeria. In this article, we develop a robust, data-driven model to utilize all
available surveys to estimate the levels and trends of FP indicators in
Nigerian states for all women and by age-parity demographic subgroups. We
estimate that overall rates and trends of mCPR and unmet need have remained low
in Nigeria: the average annual rate of change for mCPR by state is 0.5%
(0.4%,0.6%) from 2012-2017. Unmet need by age-parity demographic groups varied
significantly across Nigeria; parous women express much higher rates of unmet
need than nulliparous women. Our hierarchical Bayesian model incorporates data
from a diverse set of survey instruments, accounts for survey uncertainty,
leverages spatio-temporal smoothing, and produces probabilistic estimates with
uncertainty intervals. Our flexible modeling framework directly informs
programmatic decision-making by identifying age-parity-state subgroups with
large rates of unmet need, highlights conflicting trends across survey
instruments, and holistically interprets direct survey estimates.

formalism constructs the analogue of a Courant algebroid over the
correspondence space of a T-duality, using the language of graded manifolds,
derived brackets and we use the description of nilmanifolds in terms of
periodicity conditions rather than local patches. The strong section condition
arises purely algebraically, and we show that for a particularly symmetric
solution of this condition, we recover the Courant algebroids of both
nilmanifolds with fluxes. We also discuss the finite, global symmetries of
general local Double Field Theory and explain how this specializes to the case
of T-duality between nilmanifolds.

necessary to make several assumptions about the structure of the domains and
the cost function. In particular, Ma, Trudinger, and Wang established
regularity estimates when the domains are strongly \textit{relatively
$c$-convex} with respect to each other and cost function has non-negative
\textit{MTW tensor}. For cost functions of the form $c(x,y)= \Psi(x-y)$ for
some convex function $\Psi$, we find an associated K\""ahler manifold whose
orthogonal anti-bisectional curvature is proportional to the MTW tensor. We
also show that relative $c$-convexity geometrically corresponds to geodesic
convexity with respect to a dual affine connection. Taken together, these
results provide a geometric framework for optimal transport which is
complementary to the pseudo-Riemannian theory of Kim and McCann.

needed for such systems is the identification of surgical phases, for which the
current state of the art is a model based on a CNN-LSTM. A number of previous
works using models of this kind have trained them in a fully supervised manner,
requiring a fully annotated dataset. Instead, our work confronts the problem of
learning surgical phase recognition in scenarios presenting scarce amounts of
annotated data (under 25% of all available video recordings). We propose a
teacher/student type of approach, where a strong predictor called the teacher,
trained beforehand on a small dataset of ground truth-annotated videos,
generates synthetic annotations for a larger dataset, which another model - the
student - learns from. In our case, the teacher features a novel CNN-biLSTM-CRF
architecture, designed for offline inference only. The student, on the other
hand, is a CNN-LSTM capable of making real-time predictions. Results for
various amounts of manually annotated videos demonstrate the superiority of the
new CNN-biLSTM-CRF predictor as well as improved performance from the CNN-LSTM
trained using synthetic labels generated for unannotated videos. For both
offline and online surgical phase recognition with very few annotated
recordings available, this new teacher/student strategy provides a valuable
performance improvement by efficiently leveraging the unannotated data.

objects, related to the scaling properties of suitable partition functions, or
moments of measures of cells. When these measures are invariant for the flow of
a chaotic dynamical system, generalized dimensions take on a dynamical meaning,
as they provide the rate function for the large deviations of the first hitting
time, which is the (average) time required to connect any two different regions
in phase space. We prove this result rigorously under a set of stringent
assumptions. As a consequence, the statistics of hitting times provides new
algorithms for the computation of the spectrum of generalized dimensions.
Numerical examples, presented along with the theory, suggest that the validity
of this technique reaches far beyond the range covered by the theorem. We state
our result within the framework of extreme value theory. This approach reveals
that hitting times are also linked to dynamical indicators such as stability of
the motion and local dimensions of the invariant measure. This suggests that
one can use local dynamical indicators from finite time series to gather
information on the multifractal spectrum of generalized dimension. We show an
application of this technique to experimental data from climate dynamics.

contrary to standard multiclass classification, an instance can be associated
with several class labels simultaneously. In this chapter, we advocate a
rule-based approach to multi-label classification. Rule learning algorithms are
often employed when one is not only interested in accurate predictions, but
also requires an interpretable theory that can be understood, analyzed, and
qualitatively evaluated by domain experts. Ideally, by revealing patterns and
regularities contained in the data, a rule-based theory yields new insights in
the application domain. Recently, several authors have started to investigate
how rule-based models can be used for modeling multi-label data. Discussing
this task in detail, we highlight some of the problems that make rule learning
considerably more challenging for MLC than for conventional classification.
While mainly focusing on our own previous work, we also provide a short
overview of related work in this area.

force-velocity relation of growing biopolymers, via calculations explicitly
treating obstacle diffusion and stochastic addition and subtraction of
subunits. We first show that the subunit on- and off-rates satisfy a rigorous
thermodynamic relationship determined by the filament-obstacle interaction
potential. Both the on- and off-rates depend not only on the average force on
the obstacle, but also on the shape of the potential on the nanometer length
scale. Basing obstacle-induced reduction of the on-rate entirely on the force
overestimates the stall force when there are fluctuations in the force exerted
on a filament tip. We then perform simulations and analytic calculations using
the thermodynamic relationship. We find, consistent with expectations from
general thermodynamic relations, that the ""Brownian-Ratchet"" model is an upper
bound to the growth velocity and that for purely repulsive potentials the
growth velocity is essentially that predicted by the Brownian-Ratchet model.
For shallow potential wells of depth ~ 5k_BT, which might correspond to
transient filament-membrane attachments, the zero-force velocity is a
substantial fraction of the free-filament velocity. In this case, the growth
velocity can depend strongly on the obstacle diffusion coefficient even when
the dimensionless diffusion coefficient is large. The velocity also drops more
rapidly than predicted by the Brownian-ratchet model, in some cases by as much
as a factor of 50 at an opposing force of 1 pN. For deep potential wells, as
might result from strong filament-membrane links, both the on- and off-rates
are reduced significantly, slowing polymerization. Such potentials can sustain
pulling forces while polymerizing, but only if the attractive well has a
""shelf"" comparable to or greater than the monomer size.

most modern MAVs use miniaturized inertial measurement units (IMUs) to provide
attitude feedback, which is critical for flight stabilization and control.
However, recent adversarial attack studies have demonstrated that many commonly
used IMUs are vulnerable to attacks exploiting their physical characteristics.
Conventional redundancy-based approaches are not effective against such attacks
because redundant IMUs have the same or similar physical vulnerabilities. In
this paper, we present a novel fault-tolerant solution for IMU compromised
scenarios, using separate position and heading information to restore the
failed attitude states. Rather than adding more IMU alternatives for recovery,
the proposed method is intended to minimize any modifications to the existing
system and control program. Thus, it is particularly useful for vehicles that
have tight SWaP constraints while requiring simultaneous high performance and
safety demands. To execute the recovery logic properly, a robust estimator was
designed for fine-grained detection and isolation of the faulty sensors. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach was validated on a quadcopter MAV

inspiration from Determinantal Point Process (DPP) to propose an unsupervised

than the free-spectral range of the ring resonator, but well beyond the
linewidth of the resonator, we experimentally observe counterintuitive behavior
predicted in a recent theoretical study by Minkov et al. [APL Photonics 2,
076101 (2017)], such as the complete suppression of drop-port transmission even
when the input laser wavelength is on resonance with the optical cavity. This
can be understood as dynamical isolation of the cavity from the input light. We
also show qualitative differences in the steady-state responses of the system
between the adiabatic and nonadiabatic limits. Our experiments probe a seldom
explored regime of operation that is promising for applications in integrated
photonic systems with current state-of-the-art technology.

Ranking, the first open source library for solving large-scale ranking problems
in a deep learning framework. It is highly configurable and provides
easy-to-use APIs to support different scoring mechanisms, loss functions and
evaluation metrics in the learning-to-rank setting. Our library is developed on
top of TensorFlow and can thus fully leverage the advantages of this platform.
For example, it is highly scalable, both in training and in inference, and can
be used to learn ranking models over massive amounts of user activity data,
which can include heterogeneous dense and sparse features. We empirically
demonstrate the effectiveness of our library in learning ranking functions for
large-scale search and recommendation applications in Gmail and Google Drive.
We also show that ranking models built using our model scale well for
distributed training, without significant impact on metrics. The proposed

facilitates further academic research and industrial applications in the field
of learning-to-rank.

that appear in the theory -- the degree of nonideality and the resistance to
concentration changes of each ion type -- give rise to different regimes that
we identify and discuss. As the nonideality parameter, which becomes more
positive for stronger nearest-neighbor attraction between like-charged ions,
increases and the electrode is weakly charged, the differential capacitance is
predicted to transition through a divergence and subsequently adopt negative
values just before the ionic liquid becomes structurally unstable. This is
associated with the spontaneous charging of an electrode at vanishing
potential. The physical origin of the divergence and the negative sign of the
differential capacitance is a nonmonotonic relationship between surface
potential and surface charge density, which reflects the formation of layered
domains alternatingly enriched in counterions and coions near the electrode.
The decay length of this layered domain pattern, which can be many times larger

of paramount importance - and far from trivial, mainly due to the large number
of stochastic parameters and significant computational requirements. Adaptive
sparse grid approximations are an established approach to overcome these
challenges. However, standard adaptivity is based on global information, thus
properties such as lower intrinsic stochastic dimensionality or anisotropic
coupling of the input directions, which are common in practical applications,
are not fully exploited. We propose a novel structure-exploiting
dimension-adaptive sparse grid approximation methodology using Sobol'
decompositions in each subspace to introduce a sensitivity scoring system to
drive the adaptive process. By employing local sensitivity information, we
explore and exploit the anisotropic coupling of the stochastic inputs as well
as the lower intrinsic stochastic dimensionality. The proposed approach is
generic, i.e., it can be formulated in terms of arbitrary approximation
operators and point sets. In particular, we consider sparse grid interpolation
and pseudo-spectral projection constructed on (L)-Leja sequences. The power and
usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated by applying it to the
analysis of gyrokinetic microinstabilities in fusion plasmas, one of the key
scientific problems in plasma physics and fusion research. In this context, it
is shown that a 12D parameter space can be scanned very efficiently, gaining
more than an order of magnitude in computational cost over the standard
adaptive approach. Moreover, it allows for the uncertainty propagation and
sensitivity analysis in higher-dimensional plasma microturbulence problems,
which would be almost impossible to tackle with standard screening approaches.

path-space dynamics. Given $P$, we introduce an associated operator, also
denoted by $P$ , and we analyze its spectral theoretic properties with
reference to a system of precise $L^2$ spaces.
  Our setting is more general than that of earlier treatments of reversible

Kepler/K2 30-minute cadence observations started days before explosion and
continued past peak brightness. For several days after explosion, SN 2018oh had

explained by the interaction between the SN and a Roche-lobe filling
non-degenerate companion star. Such a scenario should also strip material from
the companion star, that would emit once the SN ejecta become optically thin,
imprinting relatively narrow emission features in its nebular spectrum. We
search our nebular spectra for signs of this interaction, including close
examination of wavelengths of hydrogen and helium transitions, finding no
significant narrow emission. We place upper limits on the luminosity of these

synthesize images in the egocentric domain from the exocentric domain using a

like from an egocentric perspective, given an exocentric video. Second, we
address the cross-view retrieval problem across the two views. Given an
egocentric query frame (or its momentary optical flow), we retrieve its
corresponding exocentric frame (or optical flow) from a gallery set. We show
that using synthetic data could be beneficial in retrieving real data. We show
that performing domain adaptation from the synthetic domain to the natural/real
domain, is helpful in tasks such as retrieval. We believe that the presented
datasets and the proposed baselines offer new opportunities for further
research in this direction. The code and dataset are publicly available.

kind found in quantum mechanics can also be present in human behavior. In these
experiments simple human choices were aggregated over large numbers of
respondents, with each respondent dealing with a single context (set of
questions asked). In this paper we present experimental evidence of
contextuality in individual human behavior, in a psychophysical experiment with
repeated presentations of visual stimuli in randomly varying contexts
(arrangements of stimuli). The analysis is based on the
Contextuality-by-Default (CbD) theory whose relevant aspects are reviewed in
the paper. CbD allows one to detect contextuality in the presence of direct
influences, i.e., when responses to the same stimuli have different
distributions in different contexts. The experiment presented is also the first
one in which contextuality is demonstrated for responses that are not
dichotomous, with five options to choose among. CbD requires that random
variables representing such responses be dichotomized before they are subjected
to contextuality analysis. A theorem says that a system consisting of all
possible dichotomizations of responses has to be contextual if these responses
violate a certain condition, called nominal dominance. In our experiment
nominal dominance was violated in all data sets, with very high statistical
reliability established by bootstrapping.

holes (PBHs) binaries with equal mass $M \sim 10^{28}$g can emit luminous
gigahertz (GHz) radio transient, which may be candidate sources for the
observed fast radio bursts (FRBs), if at least one black hole holds appropriate
amount of net electric charge $Q$. Using a dimensionless quantity for the
charge $q = Q/\sqrt{G}M$, our analyses infer that $q\sim O(10^{-4.5})$ can
explain the FRBs with released energy of order $O(10^{40}) {\rm ergs}$. With
the current sample of FRBs and assuming a distribution of charge $\phi(q)$ for
all PBHs, we can deduce that its form is proportional to $q^{-3.0\pm0.1}$ for
$q\geq 7.2\times10^{-5}$ if PBHs are sources of the observed FRBs. Furthermore,
with the proposed hypothetical scenario and by estimating the local event rate
of FRBs $\sim 2.6 \times 10^3 {\rm Gpc}^{-3} {\rm yr}^{-1}$, one derives a
lower bound for the fraction of PBHs (at the mass of $10^{28}$g) against that
of matter $f_{\rm PBH}(10^{28}{\rm g})$ $\gtrsim 10^{-5}$ needed to explain the
rate. With this inspiring estimate, we expect that future observations of FRBs
can help to falsify their physical origins from the PBH binaries coalescences.
In the future, the gravitational waves produced by mergers of small black holes
can be detected by high frequency gravitational wave detectors. We believe that
this work would be a useful addition to the current literature on
multimessenger astronomy and cosmology.

  for Open and Closed Microphone Array Configurations",,,,,"eess.AS cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Human-robot interaction in natural settings requires filtering out the
different sources of sounds from the environment. Such ability usually involves
the use of microphone arrays to localize, track and separate sound sources
online. Multi-microphone signal processing techniques can improve robustness to
noise but the processing cost increases with the number of microphones used,
limiting response time and widespread use on different types of mobile robots.
Since sound source localization methods are the most expensive in terms of
computing resources as they involve scanning a large 3D space, minimizing the
amount of computations required would facilitate their implementation and use
on robots. The robot's shape also brings constraints on the microphone array
geometry and configurations. In addition, sound source localization methods
usually return noisy features that need to be smoothed and filtered by tracking
the sound sources. This paper presents a novel sound source localization
method, called SRP-PHAT-HSDA, that scans space with coarse and fine resolution
grids to reduce the number of memory lookups. A microphone directivity model is
used to reduce the number of directions to scan and ignore non significant
pairs of microphones. A configuration method is also introduced to
automatically set parameters that are normally empirically tuned according to
the shape of the microphone array. For sound source tracking, this paper
presents a modified 3D Kalman (M3K) method capable of simultaneously tracking
in 3D the directions of sound sources. Using a 16-microphone array and low cost
hardware, results show that SRP-PHAT-HSDA and M3K perform at least as well as
other sound source localization and tracking methods while using up to 4 and 30
times less computing resources respectively.

the abundance of the `nonreactive' element Ar is fully consistent with showing
no central drop. This is further confirmed by the significant ($>3\sigma$)
central radial increase of the Ar/Fe ratio. Our results corroborate the
previously proposed `dust depletion scenario' , in which central metal
abundance drops are explained by the deposition of a significant fraction of

yet direct training methods often suffer from over-fitting. Teacher-student
optimization aims at providing complementary cues from a model trained
previously, but these approaches are often considerably slow due to the
pipeline of training a few generations in sequence, i.e., time complexity is
increased by several times.
  This paper presents snapshot distillation (SD), the first framework which
enables teacher-student optimization in one generation. The idea of SD is very
simple: instead of borrowing supervision signals from previous generations, we
extract such information from earlier epochs in the same generation, meanwhile
make sure that the difference between teacher and student is sufficiently large
so as to prevent under-fitting. To achieve this goal, we implement SD in a
cyclic learning rate policy, in which the last snapshot of each cycle is used
as the teacher for all iterations in the next cycle, and the teacher signal is
smoothed to provide richer information. In standard image classification
benchmarks such as CIFAR100 and ILSVRC2012, SD achieves consistent accuracy
gain without heavy computational overheads. We also verify that models
pre-trained with SD transfers well to object detection and semantic
segmentation in the PascalVOC dataset.

training-mining framework, which is widely used in weakly supervised object
detection tasks. However, the mining process inherently introduces various
kinds of labelling noises: false negatives, false positives and inaccurate
boundaries, which can be harmful for training the standard object detectors
(e.g. Faster RCNN). We propose a novel NOise Tolerant Ensemble RCNN (NOTE-RCNN)
object detector to handle such noisy labels. Comparing to standard Faster RCNN,
it contains three highlights: an ensemble of two classification heads and a
distillation head to avoid overfitting on noisy labels and improve the mining
precision, masking the negative sample loss in box predictor to avoid the harm
of false negative labels, and training box regression head only on seed
annotations to eliminate the harm from inaccurate boundaries of mined bounding
boxes. We evaluate the methods on ILSVRC 2013 and MSCOCO 2017 dataset; we
observe that the detection accuracy consistently improves as we iterate between

problem in coding, decoding and cryptography. In this paper, lattice reduction
technique is adopted to Gibbs sampler for lattice Gaussian sampling. Firstly,
with respect to lattice Gaussian distribution, the convergence rate of
systematic scan Gibbs sampling is derived and we show it is characterized by
the Hirschfeld-Gebelein-R\'enyi (HGR) maximal correlation among the
multivariate of being sampled. Therefore, lattice reduction is applied to
formulate an equivalent lattice Gaussian distribution but with less correlated
multivariate, which leads to a better Markov mixing due to the enhanced
convergence rate. Then, we extend the proposed lattice-reduction-aided Gibbs
sampling to lattice decoding, where the choice of the standard deviation for
the sampling is fully investigated. A customized solution that suits for each
specific decoding case by Euclidean distance is given, thus resulting in a
better trade-off between Markov mixing and sampler decoding. Moreover, based on
it, a startup mechanism is also proposed for Gibbs sampler decoding, where
decoding complexity can be reduced without performance loss. Simulation results
based on large-scale MIMO detection are presented to confirm the performance

data often has substantial amounts of measurement noise that compromises the
ability to produce accurate dimensionality reduction, parameter estimation,
reduced order models, and/or balanced models for control. Data assimilation
attempts to overcome the deleterious effects of noise by producing a set of
algorithms for state estimation from noisy and possibly incomplete
measurements. Indeed, methods such as Kalman filtering and smoothing are vital
tools for scientists in fields ranging from electronics to weather forecasting.
In this work we develop a novel framework for smoothing data based on known or
partially known nonlinear governing equations. The method yields superior
results to current techniques when applied to problems with known deterministic
dynamics. By exploiting the numerical time-stepping constraints of the
deterministic system, an optimization formulation can readily extract the noise
from the nonlinear dynamics in a principled manner. The superior performance is
due in part to the fact that it optimizes global state estimates. We
demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the method on a number of canonical

9$ or $\Delta(G) \in \{7, 8\}$ with some restrictions has a total $(\Delta(G) +
1)$-coloring. In particular, in [Shen and Wang, ""On the 7 total colorability of
planar graphs with maximum degree 6 and without 4-cycles"", Graphs and
Combinatorics, 25: 401-407, 2009], the authors proved that every planar graph
with maximum degree 6 and without 4-cycles has a total 7-coloring. In this
paper, we improve this result by showing that every diamond-free and house-free
planar graph of maximum degree 6 is totally 7-colorable if every 6-vertex is
not incident with two adjacent 4-cycles or not incident with three cycles of
size $p,q,\ell$ for some $\{p,q,\ell\}\in \{\{3,4,4\},\{3,3,4\}\}$.

for the estimation of ground-level PM2.5, which is often achieved by modeling
the relationship between AOD and PM2.5. To evaluate the accuracy of PM2.5
estimation, the cross-validation (CV) technique has been widely used. There
have been several CV-based validation approaches applied for the AOD-PM2.5
models. However, the applicable conditions of these validation approaches still
remain unclear. Additionally, is there space to develop better validation
approaches for the AOD-PM2.5 models? The contributions of this study can be
summarized as two aspects. Firstly, we comprehensively analyze and assess the
existing validation approaches, and give the suggestions for applicable
conditions of them. Then, the existing validation approaches do not take the
distance to monitoring station into consideration. A new validation approach
considering the distance to monitoring station is proposed in this study. Among
the existing validation approaches, the sample-based CV is used to reflect the
overall prediction ability; the site-based CV and the region-based CV have the
potentials to evaluate spatial prediction performance; the time-based CV and
the historical validation are capable of evaluating temporal prediction
accuracy. In addition, the validation results indicate that the proposed
validation approach has shown great potentials to better evaluate the accuracy
of PM2.5 estimation. This study provides application implications and new
perspectives for the validation of AOD-PM2.5 models.

forefront. The ultimate goal of AI is to realize machines with human mind and
consciousness, but existing achievements mainly simulate intelligent behavior
on computer platforms. These achievements all belong to weak AI rather than
strong AI. How to achieve strong AI is not known yet in the field of
intelligence science. Currently, this field is calling for a new paradigm,
especially Theory of Cognitive Relativity (TCR). The TCR aims to summarize a
simple and elegant set of first principles about the nature of intelligence, at
least including the Principle of World's Relativity and the Principle of
Symbol's Relativity. The Principle of World's Relativity states that the
subjective world an intelligent agent can observe is strongly constrained by
the way it perceives the objective world. The Principle of Symbol's Relativity
states that an intelligent agent can use any physical symbol system to express
what it observes in its subjective world. The two principles are derived from
scientific facts and life experience. Thought experiments show that they are
important to understand high-level intelligence and necessary to establish a
scientific theory of mind and consciousness. Rather than brain-like
intelligence, the TCR indeed advocates a promising change in direction to
realize true AI, i.e. artificial general intelligence or artificial
consciousness, particularly different from humans' and animals'. Furthermore, a
TCR creed has been presented and extended to reveal the secrets of
consciousness and to guide realization of conscious machines. In the sense that
true AI could be diversely implemented in a brain-different way, the TCR would
probably drive an intelligence revolution in combination with some additional
first principles.

original graph from such a sampled subgraph is of a fundamental interest. In
this work, we focus on estimating the number of connected components. It is a
challenging problem and, for general graphs, little is known about the
connection between the observed subgraph and the number of connected components
of the original graph. In order to make this connection, we propose a highly
redundant and large-dimensional representation of the subgraph, which at first
glance seems counter-intuitive. A subgraph is represented by the counts of
patterns, known as network motifs. This representation is crucial in
introducing a novel estimator for the number of connected components for
general graphs, under the knowledge of the spectral gap of the original graph.
The connection is made precise via the Schatten $k$-norms of the graph
Laplacian and the spectral representation of the number of connected
components. We provide a guarantee on the resulting mean squared error that
characterizes the bias variance tradeoff. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world graphs suggest that we improve upon competing algorithms for graphs

reduce the spectra over the quasi-free peak region, and leads to a useful
recipe to extract information of elementary $\nu_\mu N\to \mu^-\pi N$ processes

computer vision because of the birdview perspective, the highly complex
backgrounds, and the variant appearances of objects. Especially when detecting
densely packed objects in aerial images, methods relying on horizontal
proposals for common object detection often introduce mismatches between the
Region of Interests (RoIs) and objects. This leads to the common misalignment
between the final object classification confidence and localization accuracy.
Although rotated anchors have been used to tackle this problem, the design of
them always multiplies the number of anchors and dramatically increases the
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a RoI Transformer to
address these problems. More precisely, to improve the quality of region
proposals, we first designed a Rotated RoI (RRoI) learner to transform a
Horizontal Region of Interest (HRoI) into a Rotated Region of Interest (RRoI).
Based on the RRoIs, we then proposed a Rotated Position Sensitive RoI Align
(RPS-RoI-Align) module to extract rotation-invariant features from them for
boosting subsequent classification and regression. Our RoI Transformer is with
light weight and can be easily embedded into detectors for oriented object
detection. A simple implementation of the RoI Transformer has achieved
state-of-the-art performances on two common and challenging aerial datasets,
i.e., DOTA and HRSC2016, with a neglectable reduction to detection speed. Our
RoI Transformer exceeds the deformable Position Sensitive RoI pooling when
oriented bounding-box annotations are available. Extensive experiments have
also validated the flexibility and effectiveness of our RoI Transformer. The
results demonstrate that it can be easily integrated with other detector
architectures and significantly improve the performances.

in the graph frequency domain. This enables us to use any variation operators

cells and circulatory tumor cells where they dominate the dynamics of blood.
Buoyed by the success of Giant Unilamellar vesicles in explaining the dynamics
of anucleate cells such as Red Blood cells, compound vesicles have been
suggested as a simple model for nucleate cells. In this work, a theoretical
model is presented to study the deformation and dynamics of a compound vesicle
in linear shear flow using small deformation theory and spherical harmonics
with higher order approximation to the membrane forces. The results indicate
that size of the inner vesicle does not affect the tank-treading dynamics of
the outer vesicle. The inner vesicle admits a greater inclination angle than
the outer vesicle. However, the transition to trembling-swinging and tumbling
is significantly affected. The inner and outer vesicle exhibit identical
dynamics in most of the modified viscosity-shear rate parameter space. At
moderate size of the inner vesicle, a swinging mode is observed for the inner
vesicle while the outer vesicle exhibits tumbling. The inner vesicle also
exhibits modification of the TU mode to IUS-Intermediate Tumbling Swinging
mode. Moreover, synchronization of the two vesicles at higher inner vesicle
size and a capillary number sensitive motion at small inner vesicle size is
observed in the tumbling regime. These results are in accordance with the few
experimental observations reported by Levant and Steinberg2014. A reduction in
the inclination angle is observed with an increase in size of the inner vesicle
when the inner vesicle is a solid inclusion. Additionally a very elaborate
phase diagram is presented in the modified viscosity-shear rate parameter
space, which could be tested in future experiments or numerical simulations

Under the SDN architecture, it is feasible to set up multiple flows for

we focus on the stabilization problem under the joint design of the

understanding, question answering, sentiment analysis, and so on. This paper
presents a deep sequential model for parsing discourse dependency structures of
multi-party dialogues. The proposed model aims to construct a discourse
dependency tree by predicting dependency relations and constructing the
discourse structure jointly and alternately. It makes a sequential scan of the
Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) in a dialogue. For each EDU, the model
decides to which previous EDU the current one should link and what the
corresponding relation type is. The predicted link and relation type are then
used to build the discourse structure incrementally with a structured encoder.
During link prediction and relation classification, the model utilizes not only
local information that represents the concerned EDUs, but also global
information that encodes the EDU sequence and the discourse structure that is
already built at the current step. Experiments show that the proposed model
outperforms all the state-of-the-art baselines.

accounts for the uncertainties in the renewable energy source (RES) generation,
the load demand and the energy market prices using a scenario based worst-case
exploration technique. A coordinating entity in the MMG system called a power
sharing operator manages the day-ahead energy and reserve trading between the
MGs and also with the main grid, thereby enabling market clearing within the
MMG system. The proposed scheme is based on the iterative sub-gradient method.
The results showcase the convergence characteristics of the proposed scheme.
Moreover, the tradeoff between the energy and reserve costs in each MG are also
analysed. Finally, the economic benefits gained by the MMG system under the
proposed RO based cooperative trading scheme are evaluated.

equations that include at least one decoupled linear elliptic equation. In CGP,
the linear elliptic equation is solved on a coarsened grid compared to the
other equations, leading to savings in computations time and complexity. One of
the most important applications of CGP is when a pressure correction scheme is
used to obtain a numerical solution to the Navier-Stokes equations. In that
case there is an elliptic pressure Poisson equation. Depending on the pressure
correction scheme used, the CGP method and its performance in terms of
acceleration rate and accuracy level vary. The CGP framework has been
established for non-incremental pressure projection techniques. In this
article, we apply CGP methodology for the first time to incremental pressure
correction schemes. Both standard and rotational forms of the incremental
algorithms are considered. The influence of velocity Dirichlet and natural
homogenous boundary conditions in regular and irregular domains with structured
and unstructured triangular finite element meshes is investigated. $L^2$ norms
demonstrate that the level of accuracy of the velocity and the pressure fields
is preserved for up to three levels of coarsening. For the test cases
investigated, the speedup factors range from 1.248 to 102.715.

hardware designer's perspective by reviewing the existing approaches to detect
hardware vulnerabilities during the design phase. We show that a protection gap
currently exists in practice that leaves chip designs vulnerable to
software-based attacks. In particular, existing verification approaches fail to
detect specific classes of vulnerabilities, which we call HardFails: these bugs
evade detection by current verification techniques while being exploitable from
software. We demonstrate such vulnerabilities in real-world SoCs using RISC-V
to showcase and analyze concrete instantiations of HardFails. Patching these
hardware bugs may not always be possible and can potentially result in a
product recall. We base our findings on two extensive case studies: the recent
Hack@DAC 2018 hardware security competition, where 54 independent teams of
researchers competed world-wide over a period of 12 weeks to catch inserted
security bugs in SoC RTL designs, and an in-depth systematic evaluation of
state-of-the-art verification approaches. Our findings indicate that even
combinations of techniques will miss high-impact bugs due to the large number
of modules with complex interdependencies and fundamental limitations of
current detection approaches. We also craft a real-world software attack that
exploits one of the RTL bugs from Hack@DAC that evaded detection and discuss
novel approaches to mitigate the growing problem of cross-layer bugs at design
time.

sample of fifteen young stars with well-determined stellar types, ages,
abundances and kinematics. With proper motions from Gaia DR2 we also derive
orbits in a realistic Milky-Way potential. We find that our previous
radial-velocity selected LA candidates have substantial orbital angular
momentum. The substantial amount of rotational component for these stars is in
contrast with the near-polar Magellanic orbit, thus rendering these stars
unlikely members of the LA. There are four large orbital-energy stars in our
sample. The highest orbital-energy one has an age shorter than the time to disk
crossing, with a birthplace $z=2.5$~kpc and $R_{\rm GC}\sim 28$~kpc. Therefore,
the origin of this star is uncertain. The remaining three stars have disk
runaway origin with birthplaces between 12 and 25 kpc from the Galactic center.
Also, the most energetic stars are more metal poor ([Mg/H] =$-0.50\pm0.07$) and
with larger He scatter ($\sigma_{\rm [He/H]} = 0.72$) than the inner disk ones
([Mg/H] $=0.12\pm0.36$, $\sigma_{\rm [He/H]} = 0.15$). While the former group's
abundance is compatible with that of the Large Magellanic Cloud, it could also
reflect the metallicity gradient of the MW disk and their runaway status via
different runaway mechanisms.

continuous operation. While the proposed approaches in the literature can be
roughly categorized into two main groups: category- and instance-based
retrieval, in this work we show that the retrieval task is much richer and more
complex. Image similarity goes beyond this discrete vantage point and spans a
continuous spectrum among the classical operating points of category and
instance similarity. However, current retrieval models are static and incapable
of exploring this rich structure of the retrieval space since they are trained
and evaluated with a single operating point as a target objective. Hence, we
introduce a novel retrieval model that for a given query is capable of
producing a dynamic embedding that can target an arbitrary point along the
continuous retrieval spectrum. Our model disentangles the visual signal of a
query image into its basic components of categorical and attribute information.
Furthermore, using a continuous control parameter our model learns to
reconstruct a dynamic embedding of the query by mixing these components with
different proportions to target a specific point along the retrieval simplex.
We demonstrate our idea in a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed model and
highlight the advantages of our approach against a set of well-established
discrete retrieval models.

Amplification By Reversible Exchange) experiments performed at a high magnetic
field of an NMR spectrometer. SABRE is a method, which exploits the spin order
of parahydrogen (the H$_2$ molecule in its nuclear singlet state) for
hyper-polarizing the spins of various substrates to enhance their NMR signals.
An important feature of SABRE is that the substrate is not modified chemically:
instead spin order transfer takes place in a transient complex with
parahydrogen. In high-field SABRE experiments, such a transfer is achieved by
using suitable NMR excitation schemes. The approach presented here can
explicitly treat the spin dynamics in the SABRE complex as well as the kinetics
of substrate exchange (between the free and bound form) and complex interplay
of spin evolution and chemical processes. One more important effect included in
the model is the alteration of the spin state of parahydrogen giving rise to
the formation of anti-phase spin order from the initial singlet order. Such a
treatment enables a detailed analysis of known high-field SABRE schemes,
quantitative comparison with experiments and elucidation of the key factors
that limit the resulting NMR signal enhancement.

non-randomized data. After matching for observed confounders, there could
remain bias from unobserved confounders. A standard way to address this problem
is to do a sensitivity analysis. A sensitivity analysis asks how sensitive the
result is to a hypothesized unmeasured confounder U. One method, known as
simultaneous sensitivity analysis, has two sensitivity parameters: one relating
U to treatment assignment and the other to response. This method assumes that
in each matched set, U is distributed to make the bias worst. This approach has
two concerning features. First, this worst case distribution of U in each
matched set does not correspond to a realistic distribution of U in the
population. Second, sensitivity parameters are in absolute scales which are
hard to compare to observed covariates. We address these concerns by
introducing a method that endows U with a probability distribution in the
population and calibrates the unmeasured confounder to the observed covariates.
We compare our method to simultaneous sensitivity analysis in simulations and

discontinuous Galerkin method for the advection--diffusion problem on
time-dependent domains. The analysis is based on non-standard local trace and
inverse inequalities that are anisotropic in the spatial and time steps. We
prove well-posedness of the discrete problem and provide a priori error
estimates in a mesh-dependent norm. Convergence theory is validated by a
numerical example solving the advection--diffusion problem on a time-dependent
domain for approximations of various polynomial degree.

into space--time slabs which in turn are partitioned into space--time

and space--time hybridized discontinuous Galerkin method within a space--time

the sky to unprecedented detail. As part of normal operations and as the result
of multiple expected dedicated surveys, WFIRST will produce several relatively
wide-field (tens of square degrees) deep (limiting magnitude of 28 or fainter)
fields. In particular, a planned supernova survey is expected to image 3 deep

the 2-year WFIRST supernova survey, achieving a stacked depth similar to that
of the WFIRST data. We also suggest additional observations of these same
regions throughout the LSST survey to get deep images earlier, have long-term
monitoring in the fields, and produce deeper images overall. These fields will

practitioners would like to significantly reduce the number of times the
solution is saved to disk, yet retain the ability to recover any field quantity
(at any time instance) a posteriori. The objective of this work is therefore to
accurately recover missing CFD data a posteriori at any time instance, given
that the solution has been written to disk at only a relatively small number of
time instances. We consider in particular high-order discretizations (e.g.,
discontinuous Galerkin), as such techniques are becoming increasingly popular
for the simulation of highly separated flows. To satisfy this objective, this
work proposes a methodology consisting of two stages: 1) dimensionality
reduction and 2) dynamics learning. For dimensionality reduction, we propose a
novel hierarchical approach. First, the method reduces the number of degrees of
freedom within each element of the high-order discretization by applying
autoencoders from deep learning. Second, the methodology applies principal
component analysis to compress the global vector of encodings. This leads to a
low-dimensional state, which associates with a nonlinear embedding of the
original CFD data. For dynamics learning, we propose to apply regression
techniques (e.g., kernel methods) to learn the discrete-time velocity
characterizing the time evolution of this low-dimensional state. A numerical
example on a large-scale CFD example characterized by nearly 13 million degrees
of freedom illustrates the suitability of the proposed method in an industrial
setting.

in language communication systems and has been widely reported in a variety of
natural language processing applications. However, the emergence of natural
language is often modeled as a function of bias between speaker and listener
interests, which lacks a direct way of relating information-theoretic bias to
Zipfian rank. A function of bias also serves as an unintuitive interpretation
of the communicative effort exchanged between a speaker and a listener. We
counter these shortcomings by proposing a novel integral transform and kernel
for mapping communicative bias functions to corresponding word frequency-rank
representations at any arbitrary phase transition point, resulting in a direct
way to link communicative effort (modeled by speaker/listener bias) to specific
vocabulary used (represented by word rank). We demonstrate the practical
utility of our integral transform by showing how a change from bias to rank
results in greater accuracy and performance at an image classification task for
assigning word labels to images randomly subsampled from CIFAR10. We model this
task as a reinforcement learning game between a speaker and listener and
compare the relative impact of bias and Zipfian word rank on communicative
performance (and accuracy) between the two agents.

analyse a sample of $r$-band light curves of SNe~Ia, focusing on their
behaviour $\sim$ 2-4 weeks after maximum light, i.e. the second maximum. We
characterise the second maximum by its timing ($t_{r_2}$) and the integrated

the ""colour-stretch"" parameter s$_{BV}$, which can be used as a proxy for
$^{56}$Ni mass, and $\overline{\mathcal{F}}_{r_2}$, correlates with the
transparency timescale, t$_0$. Using $\overline{\mathcal{F}}_{r_2}$, for a
sample of 199 SNe from the Palomar Transient Factory and intermediate Palomar
Transient Factory, we evaluate a distribution on t$_0$ for a sample of SNe~Ia
found in an ""untargeted"" survey. Comparing this distribution to the predictions
of t$_0$ ranges from models we find that the largest overlap in t$_0$ values
between models and observations is for the sub-Chandrasekhar double detonation
models. We also compare our relations between t$_0$ and

focusing on object contour features, which is more imperceptible and difficult

coherence level reaches approximately zero in a complete inhibitory network. By
increasing the number of neurons in the network, the degree of synchronization
follows a power-law distribution; however, the number of synaptic connections

improved predictive capabilities linking
structure-property-processing-performance relationships in the system of
interest (here, irradiated nuclear fuel), which could lead to improved
experimental test planning and characterization. The uranium-molybdenum system
is the fuel system studied in this work, and historic irradiation test data is
leveraged for model development. Our model achieved a mean absolute percent
error of approximately 4% for the validation data set (when a leave-one-out
cross validation approach was applied). Results indicate our model generalizes
well to never before seen data, and thus use of deep learning methods for
material property predictions from limited, historic irradiation test data is a
viable approach.

  Accelerator",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are rapidly gaining popularity in varied
fields. Due to their increasingly deep and computationally heavy structures, it
is difficult to deploy them on energy constrained mobile applications. Hardware
accelerators such as FPGAs have come up as an attractive alternative. However,
with the limited on-chip memory and computation resources of FPGA, meeting the
high memory throughput requirement and exploiting the parallelism of CNNs is a
major challenge. We propose a high-performance FPGA based architecture - Depth
Concatenation and Inter-Layer Fusion based ConvNet Accelerator - DeCoILFNet
which exploits the intra-layer parallelism of CNNs by flattening across depth
and combines it with a highly pipelined data flow across the layers enabling
inter-layer fusion. This architecture significantly reduces off-chip memory
accesses and maximizes the throughput. Compared to a 3.5GHz hexa-core Intel
Xeon E7 caffe-implementation, our 120MHz FPGA accelerator is 30X faster. In
addition, our design reduces external memory access by 11.5X along with a
speedup of more than 2X in the number of clock cycles compared to
state-of-the-art FPGA accelerators.

subjects in studies of neurophysiology. In brain electrical stimulation
methods, following the surgery and electrode implantation, electrodes send
electrical impulses to the specific targets in the brain. The use of this
stimulation method is provided therapeutic benefits for treatment chronic pain,
essential tremor, Parkinsons disease, major depression, and neurological
movement disorder syndrome (dystonia). One area in which advancements have been
recently made is in controlling the movement and navigation of animals in a
specific pathway. It is important to identify brain targets in order to
stimulate appropriate brain regions for all the applications listed above. An
animal navigation system based on brain electrical stimulation is used to
develop new behavioral models for the aim of creating a platform for
interacting with the animal nervous system in the spatial learning task. In the
context of animal navigation the electrical stimulation has been used either as
creating virtual sensation for movement guidance or virtual reward for movement
motivation. In this paper, different approaches and techniques of brain
electrical stimulation for this application has been reviewed.

  Study","IEEE ACCESS 2018",,,,"cs.CY stat.AP stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The economic and social impact of poor air quality in towns and cities is
increasingly being recognised, together with the need for effective ways of
creating awareness of real-time air quality levels and their impact on human
health. With local authority maintained monitoring stations being
geographically sparse and the resultant datasets also featuring missing labels,
computational data-driven mechanisms are needed to address the data sparsity
challenge. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based method to
accurately predict the Air Quality Index (AQI), using environmental monitoring
data together with meteorological measurements. To do so, we develop an air
quality estimation framework that implements a neural network that is enhanced
with a novel Non-linear Autoregressive neural network with exogenous input
(NARX), especially designed for time series prediction. The framework is
applied to a case study featuring different monitoring sites in London, with
comparisons against other standard machine-learning based predictive algorithms
showing the feasibility and robust performance of the proposed method for
different kinds of areas within an urban region.

for the stock market by employing the quantum Brownian motion model. We utilize
the quantum Caldeira-Leggett master equation as a possible phenomenological
model for the stock-market-prices fluctuations while introducing the external
harmonic field for the Brownian particle. Two quantum regimes are of particular
interest: the exact regime as well as the approximate regime of the pure
decoherence (""recoilless"") limit of the Caldeira-Leggett equation. By
calculating the standard deviation and the kurtosis for the particle's position
observable, we can detect deviations of the quantum-mechanical behavior from
the classical counterpart, which bases the efficient market hypothesis. By
varying the damping factor, temperature as well as the oscillator's frequency,
we are able to provide interpretation of different economic scenarios and
possible situations that are not normally recognized by the efficient market
hypothesis. Hence we recognize the quantum Brownian oscillator as a possibly
useful model for the realistic behavior of stock prices.

We apply an apodization technique to improve the short-term

wavelength elements (comb teeth) between 5967 and 6133 cm-1 at 704 microsecond
time resolution during a 12-ms compression of a CH4-N2 mixture. We discuss the
effect of the apodization technique on the absorption spectra, and apply an
identical effect to the spectral model during fitting to recover the mixture
temperature. The fitted temperature is compared against an adiabatic model, and
found to be in good agreement with expected trends. This work demonstrates the
potential of DCS to be used as an in situ diagnostic tool for broadband, high
resolution, measurements in engine-like environments.
