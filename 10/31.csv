depend on stochastic time-varying dispersion in asset prices. Thus, our
framework uncovers an asset pricing factor whose existence emerges from an
accounting identity universal across different economic and financial

particular, in a closed, dividend-free market in which asset price dispersion
is relatively constant, a large class of portfolios must necessarily outperform
the market portfolio over time. We show that price dispersion in commodity

substantial excess returns that co-vary with changes in price dispersion as

Thesis, University of Freiburg, 2014. 81 Pages",,,,"quant-ph cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The von Neumann entropy plays a vital role in quantum information theory. The
von Neumann entropy determines, e.g., the capacities of quantum channels. Also,
entropies of composite quantum systems are important for future quantum
networks, and their characterization is related to the quantum marginal
problem. Furthermore, they play a role in quantum thermodynamics. In this
thesis the set of quantum entropies of multipartite quantum systems is studied.
The problem of its characterization is not new -- however, progress has been
sparse, indicating that the problem might be hard and that new methods might be
needed. Here, a variety of different and complementary approaches are taken.
  First, I look at global properties. It is known that the von Neumann entropy
region -- just like its classical counterpart -- forms a convex cone. I
describe the symmetries of this cone and highlight geometric similarities and
differences to the classical entropy cone.
  In a different approach, I utilize the local geometric properties of extremal
rays of a cone. I show that quantum states whose entropy lies on such an
extremal ray of the quantum entropy cone have a very simple structure.
  As the set of all quantum states is very complicated, I look at a simple
subset called stabilizer states. I improve on previously known results by
showing that under a technical condition on the local dimension, entropies of
stabilizer states respect an additional class of information inequalities that
is valid for random variables from linear codes.
  In a last approach I find a representation-theoretic formulation of the
classical marginal problem simplifying the comparison with its quantum
mechanical counterpart. This novel correspondence yields a simplified
formulation of the group characterization of classical entropies (IEEE Trans.
Inf. Theory, 48(7):1992-1995, 2002) in purely combinatorial terms.

enough to want to be good? Via four lead questions, I will illustrate
challenges and pitfalls when determining, from an AI point of view, what the

problem / What is a problem?, Who defines the problem?, What is the role of
knowledge?, and What are important side effects and dynamics? The illustration

""Data Science for Social Good"". Even if the importance of these questions may
be known at an abstract level, they do not get asked sufficiently in practice,
as shown by an exploratory study of 99 contributions to recent conferences in
the field. Turning these challenges and pitfalls into a positive
recommendation, as a conclusion I will draw on another characteristic of
computer-science thinking and practice to make these impediments visible and
attenuate them: ""attacks"" as a method for improving design. This results in the
proposal of ethics pen-testing as a method for helping AI designs to better

separate it from absorption against the compact HII regions in this area. The
first (N1) is the well-known v = 64 km/s core, and the second (N2) is a core
6'' to the north at v = 73 km/s. Using emission from 15NH3, and hyperfine
satellites of 14NH3 metastable transitions we estimate the 14NH3 column
densities of these sources and compare them to those of 14NH2D. We find that
the ammonia deuteration fraction of N2 is roughly 10-20 times higher than in
N1. We also measure an [15NH3/14NH3] abundance ratio that is apparently 2-3
times higher in N2 than N1, which could indicate a correspondingly higher
degree of nitrogen fractionation in N2. In addition, we find that N2 has a
factor of 7 higher methanol abundance than N1. Together, these abundance
signatures suggest that N2 is a younger source, for which species
characteristic of grain chemistry at low temperatures are currently being
actively liberated from ice mantles, and have not yet reached chemical
equilibrium in the warm gas phase. The high D abundance and possible high 15N
abundance in NH3 found in N2 are interesting for studying the potential
interstellar origin of abundances in primitive solar system material.

$E(X)$. This concept of \emph{Enveloping Semigroups} that he defined, has
turned out to be a very fundamental tool in the abstract theory of `topological
dynamics'.
  The flow $(X,T)$ induces the flow $(2^X,T)$. Such a study was first initiated
by Eli Glasner who studied the properties of this induced flow by defining and
using the notion of a `circle operator' as an action of $\beta T$ on $2^X$,
where $\beta T$ is the \emph{Stone-$\check{C}$ech compactification} of $T$ and
also a universal enveloping semigroup. We propose that the study of properties
for the induced flow $(2^X,T)$ be made using the algebraic properties of
$E(2^X)$ on the lines of Ellis' \ theory, instead of looking into the action of
$\beta T$ on $2^X$ via the circle operator as done by Glasner. Such a study
requires extending the present theory on the flow $(E(X),T)$. In this article,
we take up such a study giving some subtle relations between the semigroups
$E(X)$ and $E(2^X)$ and some interesting associated consequences.

challenging, especially when parameter dimensionality is high. Deep learning
has opened a new door toward knowledge representation and complex pattern

(SPID-GAN) for simultaneously learning bidirectional mappings between a

SPID-GAN is demonstrated using a series of representative problems from

the best approach involves an interesting interplay between the amount of data

of identical and independent measurements. For a given probe state we take our
measurement to be the best one for a single shot and we use this sequentially
to study the performance of different practical states in a Mach-Zehnder
interferometer when we have moderate prior knowledge of the underlying
parameter. We find that we recover the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound
asymptotically, but for low data counts we find a completely different
structure. Despite the fact that intra-mode correlations are known to be the
key to increasing the asymptotic precision, we find evidence that these could
be detrimental in the low data regime and that entanglement between the paths
of the interferometer may play a more important role. Finally, we analyse how
close realistic measurements can get to the bound and find that measuring
quadratures can improve upon counting photons, though both strategies converge
asymptotically. These results may prove to be important in the development of
quantum enhanced metrology applications where practical considerations mean

This
paper considers the challenge of estimating underlying principal components
from high-dimensional data with noise that is heteroscedastic across samples,
i.e., some samples are noisier than others. Such heteroscedasticity naturally
arises, e.g., when combining data from diverse sources or sensors. A natural
way to account for this heteroscedasticity is to give noisier blocks of samples
less weight in PCA by using the leading eigenvectors of a weighted sample
covariance matrix. We consider the problem of choosing weights to optimally
recover the underlying components. In general, one cannot know these optimal
weights since they depend on the underlying components we seek to estimate.
However, we show that under some natural statistical assumptions the optimal
weights converge to a simple function of the signal and noise variances for
high-dimensional data. Surprisingly, the optimal weights are not the inverse
noise variance weights commonly used in practice. We demonstrate the
theoretical results through numerical simulations and comparisons with existing
weighting schemes. Finally, we briefly discuss how estimated signal and noise
variances can be used when the true variances are unknown, and we illustrate
the optimal weights on real data from astronomy.

a relative comparison of the discovery potential of the two using the decay

Dynamic Programming approach for solving multistage optimization problems have
been investigated. One popular way to address this issue is the Stochastic Dual
Dynamic Programming method (SDDP) introduced by Perreira and Pinto in 1991 for
Markov Decision Processes. Assuming that the value function is convex (for a
minimization problem), one builds a non-decreasing sequence of lower (or outer)
convex approximations of the value function. Those convex approximations are
constructed as a supremum of affine cuts. On continuous time deterministic
optimal control problems, assuming that the value function is semiconvex, Zheng
Qu, inspired by the work of McEneaney, introduced in 2013 a stochastic max-plus
scheme that builds upper (or inner) non-increasing approximations of the value
function. In this note, we build a common framework for both the SDDP and a
discrete time version of Zheng Qu's algorithm to solve deterministic multistage
optimization problems. Our algorithm generates monotone approximations of the
value functions as a pointwise supremum, or infimum, of basic (affine or
quadratic for example) functions which are randomly selected. We give
sufficient conditions on the way basic functions are selected in order to
ensure almost sure convergence of the approximations to the value function on a

that accounts for thermal and shot noise, scene correlation, and exposure time.
Focusing on mean square error as a measure of linear reconstruction quality, we
show that appropriate application of a theorem of Nazarov leads to essentially
optimal coded apertures, up to a constant multiplicative factor in exposure
time. Additionally, we develop a heuristically efficient algorithm to generate
such patterns that explicitly takes into account scene correlations. This
algorithm finds apertures that correspond to local optima of a certain
potential on the hypercube, yet are guaranteed to be tight. Finally, for i.i.d.
scenes, we show improvements upon prior work by using spectrally flat sequences
with bias. The development focuses on 1D apertures for conceptual clarity; the
natural generalizations to 2D are also discussed.

radiation therapy and has made profound practice changing impact. Today,
virtually all advanced treatment delivery methods, such as IMRT, VMAT,

optimization approach that changes the treatment variables (beam intensities,
multileaf collimator shapes, beam angles, dwell times and seed or source

best value of the treatment (planning) objective has been found. It is fair to
say though that a truly optimal radiation treatment plan remains elusive. The
reasons for that include difficulties in defining meaningful planning
objectives and constraints in mathematical terms, various uncertainties in the
planning and delivery process, and the inability of optimization algorithms to
find the true optimum. Radiation therapy optimization therefore remains an
active field of research.

zero or small doping, on which the present Rapid Communication focuses, $\sigma

the FS anisotropy on the critical magnetic field ($H_{C}$) in CaC$_{6}$
superconductor is comprehensively analyzed within the Migdal-Eliashberg (M-E)

analysis is conducted in the framework of the six-band approximation, hitherto
not employed for calculations of the $H_{C}$ function in CaC$_{6}$ material.
For convenience, the obtained results are compared with the available one- and
three-band estimates reported by using the M-E theory. A notable signatures of
the increased number of bands are observed for the temperature dependent
$H_{C}$ functions. In particular, the $H_{C}$ function decreases at T=0 K as
the number of the considered bands is higher. Moreover, it is argued that the
six-band formalism yields the most physically relevant shape of the $H_{C}$
function among all considered approximations. Therefore, the six-band model
introduces not only quantitative but also qualitative changes to the results,
in comparison to the other discussed FS approximations. This observation
supports postulate that the six-band model constitutes minimal structure for FS

deformed to be highly oscillating as the frequency of the CSL gets larger,

slightly changing the graph structures (e.g., adding or removing a few edges).

several variations in its definition result in equivalent energy barriers. We
apply this model to design catalytic systems with an arbitrarily large energy

trained with a massive amount of noise and regularization, such as weight decay

fully connected layers, it is often less effective for convolutional layers.
This lack of success of dropout for convolutional layers is perhaps due to the
fact that activation units in convolutional layers are spatially correlated so
information can still flow through convolutional networks despite dropout. Thus
a structured form of dropout is needed to regularize convolutional networks. In
this paper, we introduce DropBlock, a form of structured dropout, where units
in a contiguous region of a feature map are dropped together. We found that
applying DropbBlock in skip connections in addition to the convolution layers
increases the accuracy. Also, gradually increasing number of dropped units
during training leads to better accuracy and more robust to hyperparameter
choices. Extensive experiments show that DropBlock works better than dropout in
regularizing convolutional networks. On ImageNet classification, ResNet-50
architecture with DropBlock achieves $78.13\%$ accuracy, which is more than

proposing a neural field model of color perception with spatial context for the

phenomena, known as simultaneous contrast and chromatic assimilation. They have
been previously shown to act synergistically, so that at some point in an
image, the color seems perceptually more similar to that of adjacent neighbors,
while being more dissimilar from that of remote ones. Thus, their combined
effects are enhanced in the presence of a spatial pattern, and can be measured
as larger shifts in color matching experiments. Our model supposes a
hypercolumnar structure coding for colors in V1, and relies on the notion of
color opponency introduced by Hering. The connectivity kernel of the neural
field exploits the balance between attraction and repulsion in color and
physical spaces, so as to reproduce the sign reversal in the influence of
neighboring points. The color sensation at a point, defined from a steady state
of the neural activities, is then extracted as a nonlinear percept conveyed by
an assembly of neurons. It connects the cortical and perceptual levels, because
we describe the search for a color match in asymmetric matching experiments as
a mathematical projection on color sensations. We validate our color neural
field alongside this color matching framework, by performing a multi-parameter
regression to data produced by psychophysicists and ourselves. All the results
show that we are able to explain the nonlinear behavior of shifts observed
along one or two dimensions in color space, which cannot be done using a simple
linear model.

that potentially habitable systems orbiting K- and M-dwarf stars may have very
different orbital and atmospheric characteristics than Earth. To assess the
physical distribution and observational prospects of various biosignatures and
habitability indicators, it is important to understand how they may change
under different astrophysical and geophysical configurations, and to simulate
these changes with models that include feedbacks between different subsystems
of a planet's climate. Here we use a three-dimensional (3D) Chemistry-Climate
model (CCM) to study the effects of changes in stellar spectral energy
distribution (SED), stellar activity, and planetary rotation on Earth-analogs
and tidally-locked planets. Our simulations show that, apart from shifts in
stellar SEDs and UV radiation, changes in illumination geometry and
rotation-induced circulation can influence the global distribution of
atmospheric biosignatures. We find that the stratospheric day-to-night side
mixing ratio differences on tidally-locked planets remain low ($<20\%$) across
the majority of the canonical biosignatures. Interestingly however, secondary
photosynthetic biosignatures (e.g., C$_2$H$_6$S) show much greater
(${\sim}67\%$) day-to-night side differences, and point to regimes in which
tidal-locking could have observationally distinguishable effects on phase
curve, transit, and secondary eclipse measurements. Overall, this work
highlights the potential and promise for 3D CCMs to study the atmospheric

implicitly works in the limit $\eta_{\rm cut}\to\infty$, by incorporating a
finite jet rapidity cut. We also consider the case of a step in the required
$p_T^{\rm cut}$ at an intermediate value of $|\eta| \simeq 2.5$, which is of
experimental relevance to avoid the increased pile-up contamination beyond the
reach of the tracking detectors. We identify all relevant parametric regimes,
discuss their factorization and resummation as well as the relations between
them, and show that the phenomenologically relevant regimes are free of large
nonglobal logarithms. The $\eta_{\rm cut}$ dependence of all resummation
ingredients is computed to the same order to which they are currently known for
$\eta_{\rm cut}\to\infty$. Our results pave the way for carrying out the
jet-veto resummation including a sharp cut or a step at $\eta_{\rm cut}$ to the
same order as is currently available in the $\eta_{\rm cut}\to\infty$ limit.
The numerical impact of the jet rapidity cut is illustrated for benchmark
$q\bar q$ and $gg$ initiated color-singlet processes at NLL$'+$NLO. We find
that a rapidity cut at high $\eta_{\rm cut} = 4.5$ is safe to use and has
little effect on the cross section. A sharp cut at $\eta_{\rm cut} = 2.5$ can
in some cases lead to a substantial increase in the perturbative uncertainties,
which can be mitigated by instead using a step in the veto.

show that a novel many-body phenomenon can appear due to strong, dissipative

we find a first-order transition between an opaque phase with strongly

of the hosts and the satellites, and on the host virial mass. The number
density profile for the faintest satellites is well-fitted by an NFW profile,
but the concentration is much less than the mean host mass density. The number
density profile for the brightest satellites exhibits a steep increase in slope
for host-satellite distances < 0.1 r_200, in qualitative agreement with recent
observational studies that find a steep increase in the satellite number
density at small host-satellite distances. On scales > 0.1 r_200 the satellites
of the faintest hosts trace the host mass reasonably well. On scales > 0.4
r_200, the satellites of the brightest hosts do not trace the host mass and the
satellite number density increases steeply for host-satellite distances < 0.1
r_200. The discrepancy between the satellite number density profile and the
host mass density is most pronounced for the most massive systems, with the
satellite number density falling far below that of the mass density on scales <
0.5 r_200.

emitting material (perhaps slightly more from jet axis)}, we suggest that the
Lorentz factor of the jet is $\lesssim 20$ at the time of the prompt emission,

before finally decelerating during the afterglow phase. A less extreme example
of a short GRB being observed off axis may have been GRB 150101b (Fong, et al.,

isotropic equivalent energy as compared to prompt emission, as predicted

from such phenomena in random systems. Mo- tivated by this, we study transport
in the quasiperiodic, one-dimentional (1d) Aubry-Andre model and its
generalizations to 2d and 3d. We study the conductance of open systems,
connected to leads, as well as the Thouless conductance, which measures the
response of a closed system to boundary perturbations. We find that these
conductances show signatures of a metal-insulator transition from an insulator,
with localized states, to a metal, with extended states having (a) ballistic
transport (1d), (b) superdiffusive transport (2d), or (c) diffusive transport
(3d); precisely at the transition, the system displays sub-diffusive critical
states. We calculate the beta function $\beta(g) = dln(g)/dln(L)$ and show
that, in 1d and 2d, single-parameter scaling is unable to describe the
transition. Further- more, the conductances show strong non-monotonic
variations with L and an intricate structure of resonant peaks and subpeaks. In
1d the positions of these peaks can be related precisely to the prop- erties of
the number that characterizes the quasiperiodicity of the potential; and the
L-dependence of the Thouless conductance is multifractal. We find that, as d
increases, this non-monotonic de- pendence of g on L decreases and, in 3d, our
results for $\beta(g)$ are reasonably well approximated by single-parameter

formulated as fully invariant (under both coordinate transformations and local
Lorentz transformations) theories of gravity. Several misconceptions about
teleparallel gravity and its generalizations can be found in the literature,
especially regarding their local Lorentz invariance. We describe how these
misunderstandings may have arisen and attempt to clarify the situation. In
particular, the central point of confusion in the literature appears to be
related to the inertial spin connection in teleparallel gravity models. While
inertial spin connections are commonplace in special relativity, and not
something inherent to teleparallel gravity, the role of the inertial spin
connection in removing the spurious inertial effects within a given frame of
reference is emphasized here. The careful consideration of the inertial spin
connection leads to the construction of a fully invariant theory of
teleparallel gravity and its generalizations. Indeed, it is the nature of the
spin connection that differentiates the relationship between what have been
called good tetrads and bad tetrads and clearly shows that, in principle, any
tetrad can be utilized. The field equations for the fully invariant formulation
of teleparallel gravity and its generalizations are presented and a number of
examples using different assumptions on the frame and spin connection are
displayed to illustrate the covariant procedure. Various modified teleparallel
gravity models are also briefly reviewed.

the wind of an O/B supergiant on a close orbit. Proxies exist to evaluate the
efficiency of mass and angular momentum accretion but they depend so
dramatically on the wind speed that given the current uncertainties, they only
set loose constrains. Furthermore, they often bypass the impact of orbital and
shock effects on the flow structure. We study the wind dynamics and the angular
momentum gained as the flow is accreted. We identify the conditions for the
formation of a disc-like structure around the accretor and the observational
consequences for SgXB. We use recent results on the wind launching mechanism to
compute 3D streamlines, accounting for the gravitational and X-ray ionizing
influence of the compact companion on the wind. Once the flow enters the Roche
lobe of the accretor, we solve the hydrodynamics equations with cooling. A
shocked region forms around the accretor as the flow is beamed. For wind speeds
of the order of the orbital speed, the shock is highly asymmetric compared to
the axisymmetric bow shock obtained for a purely planar homogeneous flow. With
net radiative cooling, the flow always circularizes for wind speeds low enough.
Although the donor star does not fill its Roche lobe, the wind can be
significantly beamed and bent by the orbital effects. The net angular momentum
of the accreted flow is then sufficient to form a persistent disc-like
structure. This mechanism could explain the proposed limited outer extension of
the accretion disc in Cygnus X-1 and suggests the presence of a disc at the
outer rim of the neutron star magnetosphere in Vela X-1, with dramatic
consequences on the spinning up of the accretor.

Kuiper-cliff (at $45$ au) by encounters with another cluster members before it
was enriched by the wind of the nearby Wolf-Rayet star. The supernova explosion
of a nearby star, possibly but not necessarily the exploding Wolf-Rayet star,
heated the disk to $\apgt 1500$K, melting small dust grains and causing the
encapsulation and preservation of $^{26}$Al into vitreous droplets. This
supernova, and possibly several others, caused a further abrasion of the disk
and led to its observed tilt of $5.6\pm1.2^\circ$ with respect to the Sun's
equatorial plane. The abundance of $^{60}$Fe originates from a supernova shell,
but its preservation results from a subsequent supernova. At least two
supernovae are needed (one to deliver $^{60}$Fe\, and one to preserve it in the

probable birth cluster then has $N = 2500\pm300$ stars and a radius of $r_{\rm

have been shown to display periodic modulations and coherent pulsations,
suggestive of a neutron star in orbit around a stellar companion and accreting
at super-Eddington rates. In this letter, we propose that the mass transfer in
ULX could be qualitatively the same as in Supergiant X-ray binaries (SgXB),
with a wind from the donor star highly beamed towards the compact object. Since
the star does not fill its Roche lobe, this mass transfer mechanism known as
""wind Roche lobe overflow"" can remain stable even for large mass ratios. Based
on realistic acceleration profiles derived from spectral observations and
modeling of the stellar wind, we compute the bulk motion of the wind to
evaluate the fraction of the stellar mass outflow captured by the compact
object. We identify the orbital and stellar conditions for a SgXB to transfer
mass at rates matching the expectations for ULX and show that the transition
from SgXB to ULX luminosity levels is progressive. These results indicate that
a high stellar Roche lobe filling factor is not necessary to funnel large
quantities of material into the Roche lobe of the accretor. Large stellar mass
loss rates such as the ones from the Wolf-Rayet star in M101 ULX-1 or the late
B9 Supergiant in NGC 7793 P13 are enough to lead to a highly beamed wind and a

and unbound stars with a total mass equal to several tens times the mass of the
YMC. If this was also true when globular clusters (GCs) formed, then their
cosmic density implies that most star formation before redshift ~2 made a GC
that lasted until today. Star-forming regions had to change after this time for
the modern universe to be making very few YMCs. Here we consider the conditions
needed for the formation of a ~10^6 Msun cluster. These include a star
formation rate inside each independent region that exceeds ~1 Msun/yr to sample
the cluster mass function up to such a high mass, and a star formation rate per
unit area of Sigma_SFR ~ 1 Msun/kpc^2/yr to get the required high gas surface
density from the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, and therefore the required high
pressure from the weight of the gas. High pressures are implied by the virial
theorem at cluster densities. The ratio of these two quantities gives the area
of a GC-forming region, ~1 kpc^2, and the young stellar mass converted to a
cloud mass gives the typical gas surface density of 500-1000 Msun/pc^2
Observations of star-forming clumps in young galaxies are consistent with these
numbers, suggesting they formed today's GCs. Observations of the cluster
cut-off mass in local galaxies agree with the maximum mass calculated from
Sigma_SFR. Metal-poor stellar populations in local dwarf irregular galaxies
confirm the dominant role of GC formation in building their young disks.

the initial calibration of the network parameters. Yet, it has been shown that
the calibration, also referred to as training, is generally NP-complete. This
includes networks with binary weights, an important class of networks due to
their practical hardware implementations. We therefore suggest an alternative
approach to training binary neural networks. It utilizes a quantum
superposition of weight configurations. We show that the quantum training
guarantees with high probability convergence towards the globally optimal set
of network parameters. This resolves two prominent issues of classical
training: (1) the vanishing gradient problem and (2) common convergence to
suboptimal network parameters. Moreover we achieve a provable
polynomial---sometimes exponential---speedup over classical training for
certain classes of tasks. We design an explicit training algorithm and
implement it in numerical simulations.

justified through the Whitney and Takens embedding theorems, allowing
reconstruction of manifolds/attractors through different types of observations.
We demonstrate our approach by organizing unstructured observations of response
surfaces, including the reconstruction of a cusp bifurcation surface for
Hydrogen combustion in a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor. Finally, we
demonstrate how this observation-based reconstruction naturally leads to

most previous studies focused on projecting resting-state functional MRI (fMRI)

dimensionality reduction techniques, followed by executing analysis operations.
However, linear dimensionality analysis techniques may fail to capture
nonlinearity of brain neuroactivity. Moreover, besides resting-state FC, FC
based on task fMRI can be expected to provide complementary information.
Motivated by these considerations, we nonlinearly fuse resting-state and
task-based FC networks (FCNs) to seek a better representation in this paper. We
propose a framework based on alternating diffusion map (ADM), which extracts
geometry-preserving low-dimensional embeddings that successfully parameterize
the intrinsic variables driving the phenomenon of interest. Specifically, we
first separately build resting-state and task-based FCNs by symmetric positive
definite matrices using sparse inverse covariance estimation for each subject,
and then utilize the ADM to fuse them in order to extract significant
low-dimensional embeddings, which are used as fingerprints to identify
individuals. The proposed framework is validated on the Philadelphia
Neurodevelopmental Cohort data, where we conduct extensive experimental study
on resting-state and fractal $n$-back task fMRI for the classification of
intelligence quotient (IQ). The fusion of resting-state and $n$-back task fMRI
by the proposed framework achieves better classification accuracy than any
single fMRI, and the proposed framework is shown to outperform several other
data fusion methods. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to demonstrate a
successful extension of the ADM to fuse resting-state and task-based fMRI data

close encounters in a system of several super-Earth embryos. The embryos are
embedded in a protoplanetary disk consisting of gas and pebbles and evolve in a
region where the disk structure supports convergent migration due to Type I
torques. As the embryos accrete pebbles, they become heated and thus affected
by the thermal torque (Ben\'{i}tez-Llambay et al. 2015) and the hot-trail
effect (Chrenko et al. 2017) which excites orbital eccentricities. Motivated by
findings of Eklund & Masset (2017), we assume the hot-trail effect operates
also vertically and reduces the efficiency of inclination damping. Non-zero
inclinations allow the embryos to become closely packed and also vertically
stirred within the convergence zone. Subsequently, close encounters of two
embryos assisted by the disk gravity can form transient binary planets which
quickly dissolve. Binary planets with a longer lifetime $\sim$$10^{4}$ yr form
in 3-body interactions of a transient pair with one of the remaining embryos.
The separation of binary components generally decreases in subsequent
encounters and due to pebble accretion until the binary merges, forming a giant
planet core. We provide an order-of-magnitude estimate of the expected
occurrence rate of binary planets, yielding one binary planet per
$\simeq$$2$--$5\times10^{4}$ planetary systems. Therefore, although rare, the
binary planets may exist in exoplanetary systems and they should be

order to investigate the effects of these winds on the apparent Ly alpha
properties of galaxies. We find that, for models including galactic winds, the
Ly alpha properties of massive galaxies residing in the overdense region match
well recent observations of luminous Ly alpha emitters (LAEs) at z ~ 6-7, in
terms of apparent Ly alpha luminosity, Ly alpha line width and Ly alpha
equivalent width distributions. Without winds, the same galaxies appear less Ly
alpha bright as a result of both differences in the line profile emerging from
galaxies themselves, and, in the distributions of neutral gas in the
circumgalactic (CGM) and intergalactic medium (IGM). We also study the
relations between apparent Ly alpha luminosity and various galaxy properties:
stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR) and host halo mass. At fixed halo mass,
the apparent Ly alpha luminosity of galaxies appears to depend on the
large-scale environment while this is no longer true for galaxies at a given
stellar mass or SFR. We provide simple linear fits to these relations that can
be used for quickly constructing mock LAE samples from N-body simulations. Our

rotation-powered state exhibit double-peaked X-ray orbital modulation centered
at inferior pulsar conjunction. This state, which has been known to persist for
years, has recently been interpreted as emission from a shock that enshrouds
the pulsar. However, the pressure balance for such a configuration is a crucial
unresolved issue. We consider two scenarios for pressure balance: a companion
magnetosphere and stellar mass loss with gas dominance. It is found that the
magnetospheric scenario requires several kilogauss poloidal fields for isobaric
surfaces to enshroud the MSP as well as for the magnetosphere to remain stable
if there is significant mass loss. For the gas-dominated scenario, it is
necessary that the companion wind loses angular momentum prolifically as an
advection or heating-dominated flow. Thermal bremsstrahlung cooling in the flow
may be observable as a UV to soft X-ray component independent of orbital phase
if the mass rate is high. We formulate the general requirements for shock
stability against gravitational influences in the pulsar rotation-powered state
for the gas-dominated scenario. We explore stabilizing mechanisms, principally
irradiation feedback, which anticipates correlated shock emission and companion
variability and predicts $ F_\gamma/F_{\rm X} \lesssim 14$ for the ratio of
pulsar magnetospheric $\gamma$-ray to total shock soft-to-hard X-ray fluxes.
This stability criterion implies an unbroken extension of X-ray power-law
emission to hundreds of keV for some systems. We explore observational
discriminants between the gas-dominated and magnetospheric scenarios,
motivating contemporaneous radio through $\gamma$-ray monitoring of these
systems.

existence of irrelevant objects in the entire CXR images may cause unnecessary
noise and thus limit the network performance. Second, the relatively low image
resolution caused by the resizing operation, which is a common preprocessing
procedure for training neural networks, may lead to the loss of image details,
making it difficult to detect pathologies with small lesion regions. To address
these issues, we present a novel method termed as segmentation-based deep
fusion network (SDFN), which leverages the domain knowledge and the
higherresolution information of local lung regions. Specifically, the local
lung regions were identified and cropped by the Lung Region Generator (LRG).
Two CNN-based classification models were then used as feature extractors to
obtain the discriminative features of the entire CXR images and the cropped
lung region images. Lastly, the obtained features were fused by the feature
fusion module for disease classification. Evaluated by the NIH benchmark split
on the Chest X-ray 14 Dataset, our experimental result demonstrated that the
developed method achieved more accurate disease classification compared with
the available approaches via the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
analyses. It was also found that the SDFN could localize the lesion regions
more precisely as compared to the traditional method.

2$ hyperbolic conservation laws with stochastic initial data. Precisely,
solutions converge to a solution of the local equilibrium approximation as the
relaxation time tends to zero. The initial data are assumed to depend on
finitely many random variables, and the convergence is then proved via the
appropriate analogues of the compensated compactness methods used in treating
the deterministic case. We also demonstrate the validity of this limit in the
case of the semi-linear $p$-system; the well-posedness of both the system and
its equilibrium approximation are proved, and the convergence is shown with no
a priori conditions on solutions. This model serves as a prototype for
understanding how asymptotic approximations can be used as control variates for
hyperbolic balance laws with uncertainty.

give the carrier generation rate, and their accurate determination is essential
for device modeling. We implement two techniques for increasing the accuracy of
the near fields generated by RCWA, and give some guidance on parameters
required for convergence along with an estimate of their associated computation

to rescale the local fields. These improvements allow a computational speedup
between 30 and 1000 times for spectrally integrated calculations, depending on
the density of the near fields desired. Some spectrally resolved quantities,
especially at short wavelengths, remain expensive, but RCWA is still an
excellent method for performing those calculations. These improvements open up
the possibility of using RCWA for low cost optical modeling in a full

analyzing the missing mass squared distribution as inferred from the signal

approximation of elliptic problems posed in a (3D) domain $\Omega$ when the
right-hand side is a (1D) line source $\Lambda$. The analysis and approximation
of such problems is known to be non-standard as the line source causes the
solution to be singular. Our main result is a splitting theorem for the
solution; we show that the solution admits a split into an explicit, low
regularity term capturing the singularity, and a high-regularity correction
term $w$ being the solution of a suitable elliptic equation. The splitting
theorem states the mathematical structure of the solution; in particular, we
find that the solution has anisotropic regularity. More precisely, the solution
fails to belong to $H^1$ in the neighbourhood of $\Lambda$, but exhibits
piecewise $H^2$-regularity parallel to $\Lambda$. The splitting theorem can
further be used to formulate a numerical method in which the solution is
approximated via its correction function $w$. This approach has several
benefits. Firstly, it recasts the problem as a 3D elliptic problem with a 3D
right-hand side belonging to $L^2$, a problem for which the discretizations and
solvers are readily available. Secondly, it makes the numerical approximation
independent of the discretization of $\Lambda$; thirdly, it improves the
approximation properties of the numerical method. We consider here the Galerkin
finite element method, and show that the singularity subtraction then recovers
optimal convergence rates on uniform meshes, i.e., without needing to refine
the mesh around each line segment. The numerical method presented in this paper
is therefore well-suited for applications involving a large number of line
segments. We illustrate this by treating a dataset (consisting of $\sim 3000$
line segments) describing the vascular system of the brain.

  Preliminary version accepted to SODA 2019",,,,"cs.DS cs.DM math-ph math.MP math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A well-known conjecture in computer science and statistical physics is that
Glauber dynamics on the set of $k$-colorings of a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices
with maximum degree $\Delta$ is rapidly mixing for $k\ge\Delta+2$. In FOCS
1999, Vigoda showed that the flip dynamics (and therefore also Glauber
dynamics) is rapidly mixing for any $k>\frac{11}{6}\Delta$. It turns out that
there is a natural barrier at $\frac{11}{6}$, below which there is no one-step
coupling that is contractive with respect to the Hamming metric, even for the
flip dynamics.
  We use linear programming and duality arguments to fully characterize the
obstructions to going beyond $\frac{11}{6}$. These extremal configurations turn
out to be quite brittle, and in this paper we use this to give two proofs that
the Glauber dynamics is rapidly mixing for any $k\ge\left(\frac{11}{6} -
\epsilon_0\right)\Delta$ for some absolute constant $\epsilon_0>0$. This is the
first improvement to Vigoda's result that holds for general graphs. Our first
approach analyzes a variable-length coupling in which these configurations
break apart with high probability before the coupling terminates, and our other
approach analyzes a one-step path coupling with a new metric that counts the
extremal configurations. Additionally, our results extend to list coloring, a
widely studied generalization of coloring, where the previously best known
results required $k > 2 \Delta$.

(MTCs) is one of the main challenges of future wireless systems. In this paper,
a novel fast uplink grant scheduling method based on the theory of multi-armed
bandits (MABs) is proposed. First, a single quality-of-service metric is
defined as a combination of the value of data packets, maximum tolerable access
delay, and data rate. Since full knowledge of these metrics for all machine
type devices (MTDs) cannot be known in advance at the base station (BS) and the
set of active MTDs changes over time, the problem is modeled as a sleeping MAB
with stochastic availability and a stochastic reward function. In particular,
given that, at each time step, the knowledge on the set of active MTDs is
probabilistic, a novel probabilistic sleeping MAB algorithm is proposed to
maximize the defined metric. Analysis of the regret is presented and the effect
of the prediction error of the source traffic prediction algorithm on the
performance of the proposed sleeping MAB algorithm is investigated. Moreover,
to enable fast uplink allocation for multiple MTDs at each time, a novel method
is proposed based on the concept of best arms ordering in the MAB setting.
Simulation results show that the proposed framework yields a three-fold
reduction in latency compared to a random scheduling policy since it
prioritises the scheduling of MTDs that have stricter latency requirements.
Moreover, by properly balancing the exploration versus exploitation tradeoff,
the proposed algorithm can provide system fairness by allowing the most
important MTDs to be scheduled more often while also allowing the less
important MTDs to be selected enough times to ensure the accuracy of estimation
of their importance.

contrast, granular rotations are largely irreversible. We find a weak
correlation between translational and rotational displacements, indicating that
rotational reversibility depends on more subtle changes in contact

many popular methods strive solely for depth quality, for real-time mobile
applications (e.g. prosthetic glasses or micro-UAVs), speed and power
efficiency are equally, if not more, important. Many real-world systems rely on
Semi-Global Matching (SGM) to achieve a good accuracy vs. speed balance, but
power efficiency is hard to achieve with conventional hardware, making the use
of embedded devices such as FPGAs attractive for low-power applications.
However, the full SGM algorithm is ill-suited to deployment on FPGAs, and so
most FPGA variants of it are partial, at the expense of accuracy. In a non-FPGA
context, the accuracy of SGM has been improved by More Global Matching (MGM),
which also helps tackle the streaking artifacts that afflict SGM. In this
paper, we propose a novel, resource-efficient method that is inspired by MGM's
techniques for improving depth quality, but which can be implemented to run in
real time on a low-power FPGA. Through evaluation on multiple datasets (KITTI
and Middlebury), we show that in comparison to other real-time capable stereo
approaches, we can achieve a state-of-the-art balance between accuracy, power
efficiency and speed, making our approach highly desirable for use in real-time

the amount and location of the residual carbon depends on the initial mass of
the star and assumptions about rotation and convective overshooting. We find a
wide range of possible $\mathrm{^{12}C}$ mass fractions roughly ranging from
0.1 to 10 per cent. Convection and thermohaline mixing that occurs as the ONe
WDs cool leads to nearly homogeneous interior compositions by the time that AIC
would occur. We evolve these ONe WD models and some toy WD models towards AIC
and find that regardless of the carbon fraction, the occurrence of Urca-process
cooling due to $\mathrm{^{23}Na}$ implies that the models are unlikely to reach
carbon ignition before electron captures on $\mathrm{^{24}Mg}$ occur.
Difficulties associated with modeling electron-capture-driven convective
regions in these ONe WDs prevent us from evolving our MESA models all the way
to thermonuclear oxygen ignition and the onset of collapse. Thus, firm
conclusions about the effect of carbon on the final fates of these objects
await improved modeling. However, it is clear that the inclusion of residual
carbon can shift the evolution from that previously described in the literature

methods and base their work on theoretical considerations. In contrast, when
the fruits of their research is being evaluated, basic scientific standards do
not seem to matter. Instead, simplistic bibliometric indicators (i.e.,
publications and citation counts) are, paradoxically, both widely used and
criticized without any methodological and theoretical framework that would
serve to ground both use and critique. Yet, Bornmann and Marewski [1] proposed
such a framework recently. They developed bibliometrics-based heuristics (BBHs)
based on the fast-and-frugal heuristics approach [2] to decision making, in
order to conceptually understand and empirically investigate the quantitative
evaluation of research as well as to effectively train end-users of
bibliometrics (e.g., science managers, scientists). Heuristics are decision
strategies that use part of the available information and ignore the rest. By
exploiting the statistical structure of task environments, they can aid to make
accurate, fast, effortless, and cost-efficient decisions without that
trade-offs are incurred. Because of their simplicity, heuristics are easy to
understand and communicate, enhancing the transparency of decision processes.
In this commentary, we explain several BBHs and discuss how such heuristics can
be employed in practice (using the evaluation of applicants for funding
programs as one example). Furthermore, we outline why heuristics can perform
well, and how they and their fit to task environments can be studied. In
pointing to the potential of research on BBHs and to the risks that come with
an under-researched, mindless usage of bibliometrics, this commentary
contributes to make research evaluation more scientific.

$\boldsymbol{AB}$ of two finite field private matrices $\boldsymbol{A}$ and
$\boldsymbol{B}$ from an information-theoretic perspective. In this problem,
the user exploits the computational resources of $N$ servers to compute the
matrix product, but simultaneously tries to conceal the private matrices from
the servers. Our goal is twofold: (i) to maximize the communication rate, and,
(ii) to minimize the effective number of server observations needed to
determine $\boldsymbol{AB}$, while preserving security, where we allow for up

much less energy dissipative than the claim of the classical scenario,
postulated by Biggins and Warner [Proc. R. Soc. A 470, 20130689(2014)] as the

alleged upward kicks on the chain from the table as the chain is uplifted can
at best be one of the possible factors in driving the fountain, if not totally
irrelevant. We construct an efficient chain fountain with no upward kicks in

(BH) is evaluated. The first repetitions produced by gravitational lensing are
not periodic in time; periodicity emerges only as the result of multiple
circuits of the prograde and retrograde light rings and is accompanied by
exponential dimming. Gravitational focusing creates a sequence of concentrated
caustic features and biases the detection of a repeating source toward
alignment of the BH spin with the plane of the sky. We consider the
polarization pattern in the case of emission by the Lorentz upboosting and
reflection of a magnetic field near the explosion site. Then the polarized
fraction of the detected pulse approaches unity, and rays propagating near the
equatorial plane maintain a consistent polarization direction. Near a slowly
accreting supermassive BH (SMBH), additional repetitions are caused by
reflection off annular fragments of an orbiting disk that has passed through an
ionization instability. These results are applied to the repeating fast radio
burst (FRB) source 121102, giving a concrete and predictive example of how FRB
detectability may be biased by lensing. A gravitational lensing delay of 10-30
s, and reflection delay up to $\sim 10^4$ s, are found for emission near the
innermost stable circular orbit of a $3\times 10^5\,M_\odot$ SMBH; these
effects combine to produce interesting correlations between delay time and
burst fluence. A similar repetitive pulse envelope could be seen in the
gravitational wave signal produced by a collision between compact stars near a
SMBH.

around 1.3, which is closed to the solar value. The mixing-length parameter
converges to about 1.7, which is $\sim$ 10\% lower than the solar value and

values that can be explained by accretion after BH birth. In contrast, the
three BH spin measurements in high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) show only values
near the maximum and likely have a different origin connected to the BH stellar
progenitor. We explore here two possible scenarios to explain the high spins of
BHs in HMXBs: formation in binaries that undergo mass transfer (MT) during the
main sequence (MS; Case-A MT), and very close binaries undergoing chemically
homogeneous evolution (CHE). We find that both scenarios are able to produce
high-spin BHs if internal angular momentum (AM) transport in the progenitor
star after its MS evolution is not too strong (i.e., weak coupling between the
stellar core and its envelope). If instead efficient AM transport is assumed,
we find that the resulting BH spins are always too low with respect to
observations. The Case-A MT model provides a good fit for the BH spins, the
masses of the two components, and the final orbital periods for two of the
three BHs in HMXBs with measured spins. For one of them, the mass predicted for
the BH companion is significantly lower than observed, but this depends
strongly on the assumed efficiency of mass transfer. The CHE models predict
orbital periods that are too large for all three cases considered here. We
expect the Case-A MT to be much more frequent at the metallicities involved, so
we conclude that the Case-A MT scenario is preferred. Finally, we predict that
the stellar companions of HMXBs formed through the Case-A MT have enhanced
nitrogen surface abundances, which can be tested by future observations.

participants. In practice, however, these ratings are often highly inflated,
and therefore not very informative. In this paper, we first investigate whether
the platform can obtain less inflated, more informative ratings by altering the
meaning and relative importance of the levels in the rating system. Second, we
seek a principled approach for the platform to make these choices in the design
of the rating system. First, we analyze the results of a randomized controlled
trial on an online labor market in which an additional question was added to
the feedback form. Between treatment conditions, we vary the question phrasing
and answer choices; in particular, the treatment conditions include several
positive-skewed verbal rating scales with descriptive phrases or adjectives
providing specific interpretation for each rating level. The online labor
market test reveals that current inflationary norms can in fact be countered by
re-anchoring the meaning of the levels of the rating system. In particular, the
positive-skewed verbal rating scales yield rating distributions that
significantly reduce rating inflation and are much more informative about
seller quality. Second, we develop a model-based framework to compare and
select among rating system designs, and apply this framework to the data
obtained from the online labor market test. Our simulations demonstrate that
our model-based framework for scale design and optimization can identify the

rating systems that are informative in practice can be designed, and
demonstrates how to design them in a principled manner.

BCL is written in C++ using an internal DSL called the BCL Core that provides
one-sided communication primitives such as remote get and remote put
operations. The BCL Core has backends for MPI, OpenSHMEM, GASNet-EX, and UPC++,
allowing BCL data structures to be used natively in programs written using any
of these programming environments. Along with our internal DSL, we present the
BCL ObjectContainer abstraction, which allows BCL data structures to
transparently serialize complex data types while maintaining efficiency for
primitive types. We also introduce the set of BCL data structures and evaluate
their performance across a number of high-performance computing systems,
demonstrating that BCL programs are competitive with hand-optimized code, even
while hiding many of the underlying details of message aggregation,
serialization, and synchronization.

utilizing the pluri-half-anti-canonical map from the twistor spaces. Each of
these twistor spaces is bimeromorphic to a double covering of a scroll of
planes over a rational normal curve, and the branch divisor of the double cover
is a cut of the scroll by a quartic hypersurface. In particular, the double
covering has a pencil of Del Pezzo surfaces of degree two. Correspondingly, the
twistor spaces have a pencil of rational surfaces with big anti-canonical
class. The base locus of the last pencil is a cycle of rational curves, and it
is an anti-canonical curve on smooth members of the pencil.
  These twistor spaces are naturally classified into four types according to
the type of singularities of the branch divisor, or equivalently, those of the
Del Pezzo surfaces in the pencil. We also show that the quartic hypersurface
satisfies a strong constraint and as a result the defining polynomial of the
quartic hypersurface has to be of a specific form.
  Together with our previous result, the present result completes a
classification of Moishezon twistor spaces whose half-anti-canonical system is
a pencil. Twistor spaces whose half-anti-canonical system is larger than pencil
have been understood for a long time before. In the opposite direction, no
example is known of a Moishezon twistor space whose half-anti-canonical system
is smaller than a pencil.

is the existence of a bistable regime in the behavior of these neurons. We here

excitation energies is mandatory in order to reach chemical accuracy. By
determining CC3 total energies on CCSD structures, we model a large set of
compounds (including radicals) and electronic transitions (including
singlet-triplet excitations) and successfully reach chemical accuracy in a near
systematic way. Indeed, for this particular set, our protocol delivers a mean
absolute error as small as $0.032$ eV, chemical accuracy (error smaller than
$1$ kcal.mol$^{-1}$ or $0.043$ eV) being obtained in 80\%\ of the cases. In
only three cases the error exceeds $0.15$ eV which is of the order of the
typical error provided by TD-DFT or second-order wavefunction methods for this

multiple periods and small, variable amplitudes. Nevertheless, at least over
limited time intervals, we were able to identify dominant periods in the light,
color, and velocity curves and compare the phasing of each. The color curves
appear to peak with or slightly after the light curves while the radial
velocity curves peak about a quarter of a cycle before the light curves.
Similar results were found previously for two other PPNe, although for them the
light and color appeared to be in phase. Thus it appears that PPNe are
brightest when smallest and hottest. These phase results differ from those
found for classical Cepheid variables, where the light and velocity differ by
half a cycle, and are hottest at about average size and expanding. However,
they do appear to have similar phasing to the larger amplitude pulsations seen
in RV Tauri variables. Presently, few pulsation models exist for PPNe, and
these do not fit the observations well, especially the longer periods observed.
Model fits to these new light and velocity curves would allow masses to be
determined for these post-AGB objects, and thereby provide important
constraints to post-AGB stellar evolution models of low and intermediate-mass
stars.

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end model that simultaneously solves all
three tasks in real-time given only a single RGB image. The essence of the
proposed method is to improve the prediction by i) parametrizing the targets
(e.g., 3D boxes) instead of directly estimating the targets, and ii)
cooperative training across different modules in contrast to training these
modules individually. Specifically, we parametrize the 3D object bounding boxes
by the predictions from several modules, i.e., 3D camera pose and object
attributes. The proposed method provides two major advantages: i) The
parametrization helps maintain the consistency between the 2D image and the 3D
world, thus largely reducing the prediction variances in 3D coordinates. ii)
Constraints can be imposed on the parametrization to train different modules
simultaneously. We call these constraints ""cooperative losses"" as they enable
the joint training and inference. We employ three cooperative losses for 3D
bounding boxes, 2D projections, and physical constraints to estimate a
geometrically consistent and physically plausible 3D scene. Experiments on the

prior approaches on 3D object detection, 3D layout estimation, 3D camera pose
estimation, and holistic scene understanding.

predominantly made of a ""trion-hole""---a trion (two opposite-spin electrons

component. As the trion is poorly coupled to photon, the intensity of the
lowest absorption peak is weak; it increases with doping, thanks to the growing
exciton component, due to a larger coupling between 2-particle and 4-particle
states. Under a further doping increase, the trion-hole complex is less bound
because of Pauli blocking by FS electrons, and its energy increases. The lower
peak then becomes predominantly due to an exciton dressed by FS electron-hole
pairs, that is, an exciton-polaron. As a result, the absorption spectra of
$n$-doped semiconductor quantum wells show two prominent peaks, the nature of
the lowest peak turning from trion-hole to exciton-polaron under a doping

Do these flocks of advocates migrate beyond a single community? To understand
such behavior, we collected 12,578 common advocates across a code hosting site
- GitHub and a question/answering site - Stack Overflow. These advocates were
involved in 1,549 projects on GitHub and were actively asking 114,569 questions

performed an in-depth empirical analysis using social networks to find the

on an average of 5 times on GitHub and 2 times on Stack Overflow. In
particular, advocates in flocks of two migrate more frequently than larger

conducted K'-band photometric monitoring of an SRV star SV Pegasus (SV Peg). We
measured the position change of the associating H$_2$O maser spots by
phase-referencing VLBI observations with VERA at 22 GHz, spanning approximately
3 yr, and detected an annual parallax of $\pi = 3.00 \pm 0.06$ mas,
corresponding to a distance of $D=333 \pm 7$ pc. This result is in good
agreement with the Hipparcos parallax and improves the accuracy of the distance
from 35 $\%$ to 2 $\%$. However, the GAIA DR2 catalog gave a parallax of
$\pi=1.12\pm0.28$ mas for SV Peg. This indicates that the GAIA result might be
blurred by the effect of the stellar size because the estimated stellar radius
was $\sim 5$ mas, which is comparable to the parallax. We obtained a K'-band
mean magnitude of $m_{K'} = -0.48$ mag and a period of $P=177$ days from our
photometric monitoring with a 1-m telescope. Using the trigonometric distance,
we derived an absolute magnitude of $M_{K'}=-8.09 \pm 0.05$ mag. This result
shows that the position of SV Peg in the PLR falls on the C' sequence found in

graph signal processing (GSP) efforts to date assume that the underlying

characteristics impact the properties of the graph signals of interest. Such an
assumption is often untenable beyond applications dealing with e.g., directly
observable social and infrastructure networks; and typically adopted graph
construction schemes are largely informal, distinctly lacking an element of
validation. This tutorial offers an overview of graph learning methods
developed to bridge the aforementioned gap, by using information available from
graph signals to infer the underlying graph topology. Fairly mature statistical
approaches are surveyed first, where correlation analysis takes center stage
along with its connections to covariance selection and high-dimensional
regression for learning Gaussian graphical models. Recent GSP-based network
inference frameworks are also described, which postulate that the network
exists as a latent underlying structure, and that observations are generated as
a result of a network process defined in such a graph. A number of arguably
more nascent topics are also briefly outlined, including inference of dynamic
networks, nonlinear models of pairwise interaction, as well as extensions to
directed graphs and their relation to causal inference. All in all, this paper
introduces readers to challenges and opportunities for signal processing
research in emerging topic areas at the crossroads of modeling, prediction, and
control of complex behavior arising in networked systems that evolve over time.

assist the primary and BD transmissions, and the primary receiver decodes the
information from the primary transmitter as well as the BD. We consider a
multiple-input single-output (MISO) SR and the symbol period for BD
transmission is designed to be either the same as or much longer than that of
the primary system, resulting in parasitic or commensal relationship between
the primary and BD transmissions. We first derive the achievable rates for the
primary system and the BD transmission. Then, we formulate two transmit
beamforming optimization problems, i.e., the weighted sum-rate maximization
problem and the transmit power minimization problem, and solve these non-convex
problems by applying semi-definite relaxation technique. In addition, a novel
transmit beamforming structure is proposed to reduce the computational
complexity of the solutions. Simulation results show that when the BD
transmission rate is properly designed, the proposed SR not only enables the
opportunistic transmission for the BD via energy-efficient passive
backscattering, but also enhances the achievable rate of the primary system by
properly exploiting the additional signal path from the BD.

finite selling season of length $T$. At each time period, the seller offers an
arriving customer an assortment of substitutable products under a cardinality
constraint, and the customer makes the purchase among offered products
according to a discrete choice model. Most existing work associates each
product with a real-valued fixed mean utility and assumes a multinomial logit
choice (MNL) model. In many practical applications, feature/contexutal
information of products is readily available. In this paper, we incorporate the
feature information by assuming a linear relationship between the mean utility
and the feature. In addition, we allow the feature information of products to
change over time so that the underlying choice model can also be
non-stationary. To solve the dynamic assortment optimization under this
changing contextual MNL model, we need to simultaneously learn the underlying
unknown coefficient and makes the decision on the assortment. To this end, we
develop an upper confidence bound (UCB) based policy and establish the regret
bound on the order of $\widetilde O(d\sqrt{T})$, where $d$ is the dimension of
the feature and $\widetilde O$ suppresses logarithmic dependence. We further
established the lower bound $\Omega(d\sqrt{T}/K)$ where $K$ is the cardinality
constraint of an offered assortment, which is usually small. When $K$ is a
constant, our policy is optimal up to logarithmic factors. In the exploitation
phase of the UCB algorithm, we need to solve a combinatorial optimization for
assortment optimization based on the learned information. We further develop an
approximation algorithm and an efficient greedy heuristic. The effectiveness of
the proposed policy is further demonstrated by our numerical studies.

autonomous robot equipped with a Neural Network (NN) controller that processes
LiDAR images to produce control actions. Given a workspace that is
characterized by a set of polytopic obstacles, our objective is to compute the
set of safe initial conditions such that a robot trajectory starting from these
initial conditions is guaranteed to avoid the obstacles. Our approach is to
construct a finite state abstraction of the system and use standard
reachability analysis over the finite state abstraction to compute the set of
the safe initial states. The first technical problem in computing the finite
state abstraction is to mathematically model the imaging function that maps the
robot position to the LiDAR image. To that end, we introduce the notion of
imaging-adapted sets as partitions of the workspace in which the imaging
function is guaranteed to be affine. We develop a polynomial-time algorithm to
partition the workspace into imaging-adapted sets along with computing the
corresponding affine imaging functions. Given this workspace partitioning, a
discrete-time linear dynamics of the robot, and a pre-trained NN controller
with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) nonlinearity, the second technical challenge
is to analyze the behavior of the neural network. To that end, we utilize a
Satisfiability Modulo Convex (SMC) encoding to enumerate all the possible
segments of different ReLUs. SMC solvers then use a Boolean satisfiability
solver and a convex programming solver and decompose the problem into smaller
subproblems. To accelerate this process, we develop a pre-processing algorithm
that could rapidly prune the space feasible ReLU segments. Finally, we
demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms using numerical
simulations with increasing complexity of the neural network controller.

self-cleaning. Here, we demonstrate a novel self-cleaning mechanism of textured
surfaces attributed to a spontaneous coalescence-induced wetting transition. We
focus on the wetting transition as it represents a new mechanism, which can
explain why droplets on rough surfaces are able to change from the highly
adhesive Wenzel state to the low-adhesion Cassie-Baxter state and achieve
self-cleaning. In particular, we perform many-body dissipative particle
dynamics simulations of liquid droplets sitting on mechanically textured
substrates. We quantitatively investigate the wetting behavior of an isolated
droplet as well as coalescence of droplets for both Cassie-Baxter and Wenzel
states. Our simulation results reveal that droplets in the Cassie-Baxter state
have much lower contact angle hysteresis and smaller hydrodynamic resistance
than droplets in the Wenzel state. When small neighboring droplets coalesce
into bigger ones on textured hydrophobic substrates, we observe a spontaneous
wetting transition from a Wenzel state to a Cassie-Baxter state, which is
powered by the surface energy released upon coalescence of the droplets. For
superhydrophobic surfaces, the released surface energy may be sufficient to
cause a jumping motion of droplets off the surface, in which case adding one
more droplet to coalescence may increase the jumping velocity by one order of
magnitude. When multiple droplets are involved, we find that the spatial
distribution of liquid components in the coalesced droplet can be controlled by
properly designing the overall arrangement of droplets and the distance between
them.

bulges. Improvements in the interstellar medium and stellar feedback modelling,
together with advances in computational capabilities, have allowed the current
generation of cosmological galaxy formation simulations to reproduce the
diversity of AM and morphology that is observed in local galaxies. In this
review I discuss where we currently stand in this area from the perspective of
hydrodynamical simulations, specifically how galaxies gain their AM, and the
effect galaxy mergers and gas accretion have on this process. I discuss results
which suggest that a revision of the classical theory of disk formation is
needed, and finish by discussing what the current challenges are.

that combines RNNs and physics-based models to leverage their complementary
strengths and improve the modeling of physical processes. Specifically, we show
that a PGRNN can improve prediction accuracy over that of physical models,
while generating outputs consistent with physical laws, and achieving good
generalizability. Standard RNNs, even when producing superior prediction
accuracy, often produce physically inconsistent results and lack
generalizability. We further enhance this approach by using a pre-training
method that leverages the simulated data from a physics-based model to address
the scarcity of observed data. The PGRNN has the flexibility to incorporate
additional physical constraints and we incorporate a density-depth
relationship. Both enhancements further improve PGRNN performance. Although we
present and evaluate this methodology in the context of modeling the dynamics
of temperature in lakes, it is applicable more widely to a range of scientific
and engineering disciplines where mechanistic (also known as process-based)
models are used, e.g., power engineering, climate science, materials science,
computational chemistry, and biomedicine.

  water-quality data from in situ sensors",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  River water-quality monitoring is increasingly conducted using automated in
situ sensors, enabling timelier identification of unexpected values. However,
anomalies caused by technical issues confound these data, while the volume and
velocity of data prevent manual detection. We present a framework for automated
anomaly detection in high-frequency water-quality data from in situ sensors,
using turbidity, conductivity and river level data. After identifying end-user
needs and defining anomalies, we ranked their importance and selected suitable
detection methods. High priority anomalies included sudden isolated spikes and
level shifts, most of which were classified correctly by regression-based
methods such as autoregressive integrated moving average models. However, using
other water-quality variables as covariates reduced performance due to complex
relationships among variables. Classification of drift and periods of
anomalously low or high variability improved when we applied replaced anomalous
measurements with forecasts, but this inflated false positive rates.
Feature-based methods also performed well on high priority anomalies, but were
also less proficient at detecting lower priority anomalies, resulting in high
false negative rates. Unlike regression-based methods, all feature-based
methods produced low false positive rates, but did not and require training or
optimization. Rule-based methods successfully detected impossible values and
missing observations. Thus, we recommend using a combination of methods to
improve anomaly detection performance, whilst minimizing false detection rates.
Furthermore, our framework emphasizes the importance of communication between
end-users and analysts for optimal outcomes with respect to both detection
performance and end-user needs. Our framework is applicable to other types of
high frequency time-series data and anomaly detection applications.

interesting to explore what kind of hypergraphs are perfect. A hypergraph is
linear if any 2 edges have at most 1 vertex in common. We propose the following
conjecture: (1) For $r\ge 3$, there exists $n$ such that a linear $r$-unofrm

exists $n$ such that if $G, H$ are perfect $r$-uniform hypergraphs with at

we obtain a partial result: Let $S_{2,t}=\{123,124,125,126,...,12(t+2)\}$. (An
earlier result of Sidorenko states that $S_{2,t}$ is perfect

via contact wrenches exerted at intermittent contact poses. Therefore, it is
important to consider dynamics when planning a contact sequence. Traditional
contact planning approaches assume a quasi-static balance criterion to reduce
the computational challenges of selecting a contact sequence over a rough
terrain. This however limits the applicability of the approach when dynamic
motions are required, such as when walking down a steep slope or crossing a
wide gap. Recent methods overcome this limitation with the help of efficient
mixed integer convex programming solvers capable of synthesizing dynamic
contact sequences. Nevertheless, its exponential-time complexity limits its
applicability to short time horizon contact sequences within small
environments. In this paper, we go beyond current approaches by learning a
prediction of the dynamic evolution of the robot centroidal momenta, which can
then be used for quickly generating dynamically robust contact sequences for
robots with arms and legs using a search-based contact planner. We demonstrate
the efficiency and quality of the results of the proposed approach in a set of

flux emergence is one of the most prominent features of this AR. We calculate
the magnetic helicity from photospheric tangential flows that shear and braid
field lines (shear-helicity), and from normal flows that advect twisted
magnetic flux into the corona (emergence-helicity), respectively. Our results
show that the emergence-helicity accumulated in the corona is
$-1.6\times10^{43}~Mx^2$ before the major eruption, while the shear-helicity
accumulated in the corona is $-6\times10^{43}~Mx^2$, which contributes about
79\% of the total helicity. The shear-helicity flux is dominant throughout the
overall investigated emergence phase. Our results imply that the emerged fields
initially contain relatively low helicity. Much more helicity is built up by
shearing and converging flows acting on preexisted and emerging flux. Shearing
motions are getting stronger with the flux emergence, and especially on both
sides of the polarity inversion line of the core field region. The evolution of
the vertical currents shows that most of the intense currents do not appear
initially with the emergence of the flux, which implies that most of the
emerging flux is probably not strongly current-carrying. The helical magnetic
fields (flux rope) in the core field region are probably formed by long-term
photospheric motions. The shearing and converging motions are continuously
generated driven by the flux emergence. AR 12673 is a representative as
photospheric motions contribute most of the nonpotentiality in the AR with
vigorous flux emergence.

statistical efficiency resulting from a longitudinal analysis, and an inflation
factor that accounts for the design of a SMART. The SMART design inflation
factor is typically a function of the anticipated probability of response to
first-stage treatment. We review modeling and estimation for DTR effect
analyses using a longitudinal outcome from a SMART, as well as the estimation

release of magnetic energy in the corona during solar flares. Much attention
has been given to the pre-flare magnetic topology to identify candidate sites
of magnetic reconnection, yet it is unclear how the magnetic reconnection and
its attendant topological changes shape the eruptive structure and how the
topology evolves during the eruption. Here we employed a realistic,
data-constrained magnetohydrodynamic simulation to study the evolving magnetic
topology for an X9.3 eruptive flare that occurred on 2017 September 6. The
simulation successfully reproduces the eruptive features and processes in
unprecedented detail. The numerical results reveal that the pre-flare corona
contains multiple twisted flux systems with different connections, and during
the eruption, these twisted fluxes form a coherent flux rope through
tether-cutting-like magnetic reconnection below the rope. Topological analysis
shows that the rising flux rope is wrapped by a quasi-separatrix layer, which
intersects itself below the rope, forming a topological structure known as
hyperbolic flux tube, where a current sheet develops, triggering the
reconnection. By mapping footpoints of the newly-reconnected field lines, we
are able to reproduce both the spatial location and, for the first time, the
temporal separation of the observed flare ribbons, as well as the dynamic
boundary of the flux rope's feet. Futhermore, the temporal profile of the total
reconnection flux is comparable to the soft X-ray light curve. Such a
sophisticated characterization of the evolving magnetic topology provides
important insight into the eventual understanding and forecast of solar
eruptions.

exceptionally low critical fields of $H_{c1} \sim 0.4$ T and $H_{c2} \sim 1.4$

Goldstone mode (gapless to within $\delta E$ = 0.037 meV) that persists

the spontaneous breaking of U(1) symmetry expected for a triplon BEC. However,
in contrast to other well-known cases of this phase, the high-field

The codes are run in a sequential but iterative fashion to achieve globally
energy-conserving and self-consistent radiation fields, temperature maps, and
photoionization equilibria. The output is the X-ray spectrum as seen by a
distant observer. For the example cases we consider here---a non-rotating $10
M_\odot$ black hole with solar abundances, accreting at 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, or 0.3
Eddington---we find spectra resembling actual observations of stellar-mass
black holes in the soft or steep power-law state: broad thermal peaks (at 1-3
keV), steep power-laws extending to high energy ($\Gamma$ = 2.7-4.5), and
prominent, asymmetric Fe K$\alpha$ emission lines with equivalent widths in the
range 40-400 eV (larger EW at lower accretion rates). By starting with
simulation data, we obviate the need for parameterized descriptions of the
accretion flow geometry---no a priori specification of the corona's shape or
flux, or the disk temperature or density, etc., are needed. Instead, we apply
the relevant physical principles to simulation output using appropriate
numerical techniques; this procedure allows us to calculate
inclination-dependent spectra after choosing only a small number of physically
meaningful parameters: black hole mass and spin, accretion rate, and elemental
abundances.

can converge with an iteration count close to that of ADMM, while paying a
computational cost per iteration close to that of PDHG. Through experiments on
a CUDA GPU, we empirically validate the theory and demonstrate that NCS can
effectively utilize the parallel computing capabilities of CUDA.

aggregates the matching responses of multiple visual features. Feasible sets of
features can be either descriptors (SIFT, HSV) for an entire image or the same
descriptor for different local parts (face, body). Ideally, the to-be-fused
heterogeneous features are pre-assumed to be discriminative and complementary
to each other. However, the effectiveness of different features varies
dramatically according to different queries. That is to say, for some queries,
a feature may be neither discriminative nor complementary to existing ones,
while for other queries, the feature suffices. As a result, it is important to
estimate the effectiveness of features in a query-adaptive manner. To this end,
this article proposes a new late fusion scheme at the score level. We base our
method on the observation that the sorted score curves contain patterns that
describe their effectiveness. For example, an ""L""-shaped curve indicates that
the feature is discriminative while a gradually descending curve suggests a bad
feature. As such, this paper introduces a query-adaptive late fusion pipeline.
In the hand-crafted version, it can be an unsupervised approach to tasks like
particular object retrieval. In the learning version, it can also be applied to
supervised tasks like person recognition and pedestrian retrieval, based on a
trainable neural module. Extensive experiments are conducted on two object
retrieval datasets and one person recognition dataset. We show that our method
is able to highlight the good features and suppress the bad ones, is resilient
to distractor features, and achieves very competitive retrieval accuracy
compared with the state of the art. In an additional person re-identification
dataset, the application scope and limitation of the proposed method are
studied.

they receive unpaired data and let them infer the missing pair and optimize the
model with reconstruction loss. If we only have speech without transcription,
ASR generates the most likely transcription from the speech data, and then TTS
uses the generated transcription to reconstruct the original speech features.
However, in previous papers, we just limited our back-propagation to the
closest module, which is the TTS part. One reason is that back-propagating the
error through the ASR is challenging due to the output of the ASR are discrete
tokens, creating non-differentiability between the TTS and ASR. In this paper,
we address this problem and describe how to thoroughly train a speech chain
end-to-end for reconstruction loss using a straight-through estimator (ST).
Experimental results revealed that, with sampling from ST-Gumbel-Softmax, we

  Saturation",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose an enhanced quasi-maximum likelihood (EQML) decoder
for LDPC codes with short block lengths. After the failure of the conventional
belief propagation (BP) decoding, the proposed EQML decoder selects unreliable
variable nodes (VNs) and saturates their associated channel output values to
generate a list of decoder input sequences. Each decoder input sequence in the
list is then decoded by the conventional BP decoder to obtain the most likely
codeword. To improve the accuracy of selecting unreliable VNs, we propose an
edge-wise selection method based on the sign fluctuation of VNs' extrinsic
messages. A partial pruning stopping (PPS) rule is also presented to reduce the
decoding latency. Simulation results show that the proposed EQML decoder
outperforms the conventional BP decoder and the augmented BP decoder for short
LDPC codes. It even approaches the performance of ML decoding within 0.3 dB in
terms of frame error rate. In addition, the proposed PPS rule achieves a lower
decoding latency compared to the list decoding stopping rule.

improve the accuracy, the initial complex state should be decomposed into the
real and imaginary parts and stored in an extended state (rebit) which can be
tracked individually by two bases of an extra qubit. For pure states, the
numerical calculations show that the trace distances between the true state and
the reconstructed state obtained from the rebit method are more precise than
those ones obtained from the usual DSM and quantum state tomography (SQT)
because the number of projective measurements is reduced. For mixed states, the
rebit method gives the same accuracy in comparison to the usual DSM, while it
is less precise than QST. Its precision is also significantly improved when
using nearly-pure states. Our proposal holds promises as a reliable tool for
quantum computation, testing of quantum circuits by using only real amplitudes.

the production of superheavy elements. The recent experimental measurements
reveal that the fusion-evaporation cross section in the $3n$ reaction channel
of $^{48}$Ca+$^{239}$Pu is 50 times lower than using $^{244}$Pu as target
nucleus. However, the precise mechanisms of this remarkable isotopic dependence
are not well understood.
  Purpose: To understand the experimental observation of the rapid decrease of
stability of superheavy nuclei as the neutron number decreases, the theoretical
studies of quasifission and fusion-fission in connection with experimental
production for $Z$=114 flerovium isotopes are required to investigate the
possible differences in reaction mechanisms induced by these two targets.
  Methods: We propose an approach called TDHF+HIVAP to take into account both
the evolution of dinuclear system and the deexcitation of compound nucleus,
which combines the microscopic time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) method for
the fusion and quasifission dynamics with the statistical evaporation model
HIVAP for fusion-fission dynamics.
  Results: ......The quantum shell effect displays a crucial role in both the
quasifission and the fusion-fission processes. The quasifission is considerably
reduced and the survival probability is enhanced around one order of magnitude
in the reaction using $^{244}$Pu target as compared to the $^{239}$Pu case.
  Conclusions: The studies by using TDHF+HIVAP method well account for the
experimental observations and the present method clearly shows its
applicability in the reaction mechanisms of quasifission and fusion-fission
dynamics. The experimental and theoretical results encourage the use of
neutron-rich targets for the production of new superheavy elements.

Specifically, to characterize the long-term payoff of each potential CU-D2D

allocation factor based on the instantaneous channel state information (CSI).
We prove that the optimal policy is a threshold policy. Since CUs and D2D pairs

mutually. Therefore, to study the behaviors of CUs and D2D pairs, we formulate
the pairing problem as a matching game, based on the long-term payoff of each

level of smoothness over both the network and decision parameters, while
allowing for sparse activation of a subset of nodes for individual samples. In

low dimensional manifolds parameterized by compact B-splines, which are indexed
by a position parameter. Instead of sampling from a categorical distribution to
pick a branch, samples choose a continuous position to pick a function weight.

observed by space-based instruments, and the corresponding coronal magnetic

analysis shows that the electric current in the two ARs was distributed mostly
around the main polarity inversion lines (PILs) where the flares happened, and
the magnetic chirality (indicated by the signs of force-free factor $\alpha$)
along the main PILs is opposite for the two ARs, i.e., left-handed ($\alpha<0$)
for AR 10930 and right-handed ($\alpha>0$) for AR 11158. It is found that, for
both the flare events, a prominent magnetic connectivity (featured by
co-localized strong $\alpha$ and strong current density distributions) was
formed along the main PIL before flare and was totally broken after flare
eruption. The two branches of the broken magnetic connectivity, combined with
the prominent magnetic connectivity before flare, compose the opposite magnetic
configurations in the two ARs owing to their opposite chirality, i.e., Z-shaped
configuration in AR 10930 with left-handed chirality and inverse Z-shaped
configuration in AR 11158 with right-handed chirality. It is speculated that
two-ribbon flares can be generally classified to these two magnetic
configurations by chirality in the flare source regions of ARs.

to acquire evidence from experts'assessments as recorded in historical
datasets. Then a data-driven evidential reasoning rule based model is
introduced to R&D project selection process by combining multiple pieces of
evidence with different weights and reliabilities. As a result, the total
belief degrees and the overall performance can be generated for ranking and
selecting projects. Finally, a case study on the R&D project selection for the
National Science Foundation of China is conducted to show the effectiveness of
the proposed model. The data-driven evidential reasoning rule based model for
project evaluation and selection (1) utilizes experimental data to represent
experts' assessments by using belief distributions over the set of final
funding outcomes, and through this historic statistics it helps experts and
applicants to understand the funding probability to a given assessment grade,
(2) implies the mapping relationships between the evaluation grades and the
final funding outcomes by using historical data, and (3) provides a way to make
fair decisions by taking experts' reliabilities into account. In the
data-driven evidential reasoning rule based model, experts play different roles
in accordance with their reliabilities which are determined by their previous
review track records, and the selection process is made interpretable and
fairer. The newly proposed model reduces the time-consuming panel review work
for both managers and experts, and significantly improves the efficiency and
quality of project selection process. Although the model is demonstrated for
project selection in the NSFC, it can be generalized to other funding agencies
or industries.

  Invariance","11 pages, 17 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As object recognition becomes an increasingly common ML task, and recent
research demonstrating CNNs vulnerability to attacks and small image
perturbations necessitate fully understanding the foundations of object
recognition. We focus on understanding the mechanisms behind how neural
networks generalize to spatial transformations of complex objects. While humans
excel at discriminating between objects shown at new positions, orientations,
and scales, past results demonstrate that this may be limited to familiar
objects - humans demonstrate low tolerance of spatial-variances for
purposefully constructed novel objects. Because training artificial neural
networks from scratch is similar to showing novel objects to humans, we seek to
understand the factors influencing the tolerance of CNNs to spatial
transformations. We conduct a thorough empirical examination of seven
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. By training on a controlled
face image dataset, we measure model accuracy across different degrees of 5
transformations: position, size, rotation, Gaussian blur, and resolution
transformation due to resampling. We also examine how learning strategy affects
generalizability by examining how different amounts of pre-training have on
model robustness. Overall, we find that the most significant contributor to
transformation invariance is pre-training on a large, diverse image dataset.
Moreover, while AlexNet tends to be the least robust network, VGG and ResNet
architectures demonstrate higher robustness for different transformations.
Along with kernel visualizations and qualitative analyses, we examine
differences between learning strategy and inherent architectural properties in
contributing to invariance of transformations, providing valuable information
towards understanding how to achieve greater robustness to transformations in
CNNs.

based on the semi-discrete (discrete in space but continuous in time) error
estimate on the time-dependent Kohn-Sham orbitals, to construct a close to

full-discrete error estimate to guide our choice of the time-step. We employ
spectral finite-elements along with Gauss-Legendre-Lobatto quadrature to render
the overlap matrix diagonal, simplifying the inversion of the overlap matrix

the second-order Magnus operator as the time-evolution operator in all our

expressed as exponential of a matrix, on the Kohn-Sham orbitals is obtained
efficiently through an adaptive Lanczos iteration. We observe close to optimal
rates of convergence of the dipole moment with respect to spatial and temporal

replacing every counter of HyperLogLog with a list of feature possible maxim

This paper proposes a novel counter for HyperLogLog which consumes smaller size
of memory than that of LFPM. Our counter is called bit distance recorder BDR,
because it maintains the distance of every left most ""1"" bit position. The size
of BDR is fixed. Based on BDR, we design a multi hosts' cardinalities

neural networks. It is a feedforward network typified by the use of beta
function as a hidden activation function. Beta is a flexible transfer function
representing richer forms than the common existing functions. As in every
network, the architecture setting as well as the learning method are two main
gauntlets faced by BBFNN. In this paper, new architecture and training
algorithm are proposed for the BBFNN. An Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is used
as a training approach of BBFNN with the aim of quickening the training
process. The peculiarity of ELM is permitting a certain decrement of the
computing time and complexity regarding the already used BBFNN learning
algorithms such as backpropagation, OLS, etc. For the architectural design, a
recurrent structure is added to the common BBFNN architecture in order to make
it more able to deal with complex, non linear and time varying problems.
Throughout this paper, the conceived recurrent ELM-trained BBFNN is tested on a
number of tasks related to time series prediction, classification and
regression. Experimental results show noticeable achievements of the proposed
network compared to common feedforward and recurrent networks trained by ELM
and using hyperbolic tangent as activation function. These achievements are in
terms of accuracy and robustness against data breakdowns such as noise signals.

(MPS) radio sources. We have used mid-infrared data from the Wide-field
Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) catalogue to search for the host galaxies of 65
strongly-scintillating MWA sources and compare their properties with those of
the overall population of bright low-frequency radio sources. We identified
WISE mid-infrared counterparts for 91% of the bright sources in a single 900

sources were typically at least 1 mag fainter in the WISE W1 (3.4 micron) band
than the hosts of weakly-scintillating MWA sources of similar radio flux
density. This difference arises mainly because the strongly-scintillating
sources are more distant. We estimate that strongly-scintillating MWA sources
have a median redshift of z ~ 1.5, and that at least 30% of them are likely to
lie at z > 2. The recently-developed wide-field IPS technique therefore has the
potential to provide a powerful new tool for identifying high-redshift radio

a bulk Comptonization process which usually observe in the very high soft VHS
state of blackhole BH XRBs and the high soft HS state of neutron star (NS) and
BH XRBs. Earlier, to generate the power-law tail in bulk Comptonization
framework, a free-fall converging flow into BH or NS has been considered as a
bulk region. In this work, for a bulk region we consider mainly an outflow
geometry from the accretion disk which is bounded by a torus surrounding the
compact object. We have a two choice for an outflow geometry i) collimated flow
ii) conical flow of opening angle $\theta_b$ and the axis is perpendicular to
the disk. We also consider an azimuthal velocity of the torus fluids as a bulk
motion where the fluids are rotating around the compact object (a torus flow).
We find that the power-law tail can be generated in a torus flow with having
large optical depth and bulk speed ($>$ 0.75c), and in conical flow with
$\theta_b$ $>$ $\sim$30 degree for a low value of Comptonizing medium
temperature. Particularly, in conical flow the low opening angle is more
favourable to generate the power-law tail in both state HS and VHS. We notice
that when the outflow is collimated, then the emergent spectrum does not have
power-law component for a low Comptonizing medium temperature.

eruptive flares of classes X2.2 and X9.3 that occurred in the sigmoidal active
region NOAA 12673 on 2017 September 6, by combining observations of Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly and Helioseismic Magnetic Imager instruments on board the
Solar Dynamics Observatory. On the day of the reported activity, the
photospheric structure of the active region displayed a very complex network of
$\delta$-sunspots that gave rise to the formation of a coronal sigmoid observed
in the hot EUV channels. Both X-class flares initiated from the core of the
sigmoid sequentially within an interval of $\sim$3 hours and progressed as a
single ""sigmoid--to--arcade"" event. Differential emission measure analysis
reveals strong heating of plasma at the core of the active region right from
the pre-flare phase which further intensified and spatially expanded during
each event. The identification of a pre-existing magnetic null by
non-force-free-field modeling of the coronal magnetic fields at the location of
early flare brightenings and remote faint ribbon-like structures during the
pre-flare phase, which were magnetically connected with the core region,
provide support for the breakout model of solar eruption. The magnetic
extrapolations also reveal flux rope structures prior to both flares which are
subsequently supported by the observations of the eruption of hot EUV channels.
The second X-class flare diverged from the standard flare scenario in the
evolution of two sets of flare ribbons, that are spatially well separated,
providing firm evidence of magnetic reconnections at two coronal heights.

of the dust continuum emission at 1.3 mm and 12CO J=2-1 line emission of the
transitional disk around DM Tau. DM Tau's disk is thought to possess a
dust-free inner cavity inside a few au, from the absence of near-infrared
excess on its spectral energy distribution (SED). Previous submillimeter
observations were, however, unable to detect the cavity; instead, a dust ring
~20 au in radius was seen. The excellent angular resolution achieved in the new
ALMA observations, 43 x 31 mas, allows discovery of a 4 au radius inner dust
ring, confirming previous SED modeling results. This inner ring is symmetric in
continuum emission, but asymmetric in 12CO emission. The known (outer) dust
ring at ~20 au is recovered and shows azimuthal asymmetry with a strong-weak
side contrast of ~1.3. The gap between these two rings is depleted by a factor
of ~40 in dust emission relative to the outer ring. An extended outer dust disk
is revealed, separated from the outer ring by another gap. The location of the
inner ring is comparable to that of the main asteroid belt in the solar system.
As a disk with a ""proto-asteroid belt,"" the DM Tau system offers valuable clues
to disk evolution and planet formation in the terrestrial planet forming

automatically generating architectures has attracted increasingly more

promising results. However, they mainly aim at picking a series of single

and creative designs in the carefully hand-crafted neural networks, such as
Inception-block in GoogLeNet, residual block in residual network and dense

demonstrate that our method is very effective, achieving comparable or better

lithography can reach feature sizes down to ~0.5-0.6 micrometers, the accurate

gratings with periods in the range of 1-2 {\mu}m. This is particularly relevant
for the exposure of large areas and wafers thinner than 300{\mu}m. If the wafer
or mask surface is not fully flat due to any kind of defects, such as
bowing/warpage or remaining topography of the surface in case of overlay
exposures, noticeable linewidth variations or complete failure of lithography
step will occur. We utilized the newly developed Displacement Talbot
lithography to pattern gratings with equal lines and spaces and periods in the
range of 1.0 to 2.4 {\mu}m. The exposures in this lithography process do not
require contact between the mask and the wafer, which makes it essentially
insensitive to surface planarity and enables exposures with very high linewidth
uniformity on thin and even slightly deformed wafers. We demonstrated pattern
transfer of such exposures into Si substrates by reactive ion etching using the
Bosch process. An etching depth of 30 {\mu}m or more for the whole range of
periods was achieved, which corresponds to very high aspect ratios up to 60:1.

optimized by a high-level multi-reference DFT method and the density along the
path is analyzed by the QTAIM and stress tensor methods. The performed density
analysis suggests that, in both $S_{1}$ and $S_{0}$ electronic states, there
exists an attractive interaction between the ends of the fissile $\sigma$ -bond
of CHD that steers the ring-opening reaction predominantly in the direction of
restoration of the ring. It is suggested that opening of the ring and formation
of the reaction product (HT) can only be achieved when there is a sufficient
persistent nuclear momentum in the direction of stretching of the fissile bond.
As this orientation of the nuclear momentum vector can be expected to be
relatively rare during the dynamics, this explains the observed low quantum
yield of the ring-opening reaction.

in practical implementation of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiuser

consumption with respect to its digital baseband counterpart. The
implementation cost, performance, and power efficiency of HDA beamforming
depends on the level of connectivity and reconfigurability of the analog
beamforming network. In this paper, we investigate the performance of two
typical architectures for HDA MU-MIMO, i.e., the fully-connected (FC)
architecture where each RF antenna port is connected to all antenna elements of
the array, and the one-stream-per-subarray (OSPS) architecture where the RF
antenna ports are connected to disjoint subarrays. We jointly consider the
initial beam acquisition phase and data communication phase, such that the
latter takes place by using the beam direction information obtained in the
former phase. For each phase, we propose our own BA and precoding schemes that
outperform the counterparts in the literature. We also evaluate the power
efficiency of the two HDA architectures taking into account the practical
hardware impairments, e.g., the power dissipation at different hardware
components as well as the potential power backoff under typical power amplifier
(PA) constraints. Numerical results show that the two architectures achieve
similar sum spectral efficiency, but the OSPS architecture outperforms the FC
case in terms of hardware complexity and power efficiency, only at the cost of
a slightly longer time of initial beam acquisition.

biometric systems and numerous countermeasures have been proposed to address
it. However, majority of them directly extract feature descriptors and
distinguish fake faces from the real ones in existing color spaces (e.g. RGB,
HSV and YCbCr). Unfortunately, it is unknown for us which color space is the
best or how to combine different spaces together. To make matters worse, the
real and fake faces are overlapped in existing color spaces. So, in this paper,
a learned distinguishable color-liked space is generated to deal with the
problem of face PAD. More specifically, we present an end-to-end deep learning
network that can map existing color spaces to a new learned color-liked space.
Inspired by the generator of generative adversarial network (GAN), the proposed
network consists of a space generator and a feature extractor. When training
the color-liked space, a new triplet combination mechanism of points-to-center
is explored to maximize interclass distance and minimize intraclass distance,
and also keep a safe margin between the real and presented fake faces.
Extensive experiments on two standard face PAD databases, i.e., Relay-Attack

excellent generalization capability.

emerged on the market, each one claiming to revolutionize the way of
distributed transaction processing in one way or the other. Many blockchain
features, such as byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), are indeed valuable
additions in modern environments. However, despite all the hype around the
technology, many of the challenges that blockchain systems have to face are
fundamental transaction management problems. These are largely shared with
traditional database systems, which have been around for decades already.
  These similarities become especially visible for systems, that blur the lines
between blockchain systems and classical database systems. A great example of
this is Hyperledger Fabric, an open-source permissioned blockchain system under
development by IBM. By having a relaxed view on BFT, the transaction pipeline
of Fabric highly resembles the workflow of classical distributed databases
systems.
  This raises two questions: (1) Which conceptual similarities and differences
do actually exist between a system such as Fabric and a classical distributed
database system? (2) Is it possible to improve on the performance of Fabric by
transitioning technology from the database world to blockchains and thus
blurring the lines between these two types of systems even further? To tackle
these questions, we first explore Fabric from the perspective of database
research, where we observe weaknesses in the transaction pipeline. We then
solve these issues by transitioning well-understood database concepts to
Fabric, namely transaction reordering as well as early transaction abort. Our
experimental evaluation shows that our improved version Fabric++ significantly
increases the throughput of successful transactions over the vanilla version by
up to a factor of 3x.

are analysed asymptotically. It is shown that the summatory function of a

fluctuations multiplied by a scaling factor. Each of these terms corresponds to
an eigenvalue of the sum of matrices of a linear representation of the
sequence; only the eigenvalues of absolute value larger than the joint spectral
radius of the matrices contribute terms which grow faster than the error term.
  The paper has a particular focus on the Fourier coefficients of the periodic
fluctuations: They are expressed as residues of the corresponding Dirichlet
generating function. This makes it possible to compute them in an efficient
way. The asymptotic analysis deals with Mellin--Perron summations and uses two
arguments to overcome convergence issues, namely H\""older regularity of the
fluctuations together with a pseudo-Tauberian argument.
  Apart from the very general result, three examples are discussed in more
detail: sequences defined as the sum of outputs written by a transducer when
reading a $q$-ary expansion of the input; the amount of esthetic numbers in the
first~$N$ natural numbers; and the number of odd entries in the rows of
Pascal's rhombus. For these examples, very precise asymptotic formul\ae{} are
presented. In the latter two examples, prior to this analysis only rough

from the full-Stokes profiles. In total, eight maps were inverted and the
variation of the magnetic properties in time were quantified using linear or
quadratic fits. We found a linear decay of the umbral vertical magnetic field,
magnetic flux, and area. The penumbra showed a linear increase of the vertical
magnetic field and a sharp decay of the magnetic flux. In addition, the
penumbral area quadratically decayed. The vertical component of the magnetic
field is weaker on the umbra-penumbra boundary of the studied decaying sunspot
compared to stable sunspots. Its value seem to be steadily decreasing during
the decay phase. Moreover, at any time of the shown sunspot decay, the inner
penumbra boundary does not match with a constant value of the vertical magnetic
field, contrary to what was seen in stable sunspots. During the decaying phase
of the studied sunspot, the umbra does not have a sufficiently strong vertical
component of the magnetic field and is thus unstable and prone to be
disintegrated by convection or magnetic diffusion. No constant value of the

  Non-exponential Job Sizes","This paper was accepted in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",,,,"cs.DC cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Work sharing and work stealing are two scheduling paradigms to redistribute
work when performing distributed computations. In work sharing, processors
attempt to migrate pending jobs to other processors in the hope of reducing
response times. In work stealing, on the other hand, underutilized processors
attempt to steal jobs from other processors. Both paradigms generate a certain
communication overhead and the question addressed in this paper is which of the
two reduces the response time the most given that they use the same amount of
communication overhead.
  Prior work presented explicit bounds, for large scale systems, on when
randomized work sharing outperforms randomized work stealing in case of Poisson
arrivals and exponential job durations and indicated that work sharing is best
when the load is below $\phi -1 \approx 0.6180$, with $\phi$ being the golden
ratio.
  In this paper we revisit this problem and study the impact of the job size
distribution using a mean field model. We present an efficient method to
determine the boundary between the regions where sharing or stealing is best
for a given job size distribution, as well as bounds that apply to any
(phase-type) job size distribution. The main insight is that work stealing
benefits significantly from having more variable job sizes and work sharing may

probed by molecular absorption spectroscopic (MAS) techniques the absorption
signal can, under certain conditions, be reduced and distorted. The reason has
been attributed to the fact that a substantial fraction of the molecules in the
interaction region will reside in excited vibrational states, which leads to a
depletion of the vibrational ground state. One type of molecule in which this
can take place is methane. A model for this phenomenon, based on $\text{CH}_4$
in trace concentrations in either $\text{N}_2$ or dry air in a cylindrical gas
cell, detected by mid-infrared light in the 1 - 100 Torr pressure range, is
presented. Due to a fast collisional coupling between various rotational states
and velocity groups we suggest that depletion in MAS can be modeled adequately
by a simple three-level system to which the transport of molecules in the
system is coupled as diffusion according to Fick's law, applied to each level
individually. The model is verified in a separate work [Hausmaninger T et al.,
J Quant Spectrosc Radiat Tr. 2017;205:59-70] with good agreement. It predicts
that depletion has a strong pressure dependence in the 1 - 30 Torr range, that
it is significantly more pronounced in $\text{N}_2$ than in air, and that
considerable degrees of depletion can be obtained for mW powers of light (> 10%
for powers > 20 mW). The findings indicate that, unless precautions are taken,
depletion can adversely affect quantitative assessments performed by MAS. Means
of how to reduce depletion are given.

because of their small size and the lack of a standard spin detector comparable

to hear about new methods for detecting spin currents and spin accumulations. A

However, because no standard procedures or reference measurements are available

observed by McLaughlin et al. To illustrate that the estimated size is
exceptionally large, we use a comparison with another spin-caloritronic effect:
the spin-dependent Seebeck effect. Such a large TSSE is in contradiction with
previous experiments that could not resolve a TSSE signal. Therefore, we
suggest that signal measured by McLaughlin et al. is not or not only caused by
the TSSE.

difficult to study due to its low surface brightness and large physical extent.
We present optical spectra of three ICL regions in the Coma cluster, located
between 100-180kpc from their nearest BCGs: NGC4889 and NGC4874. The mean
surface brightness of the three ICL regions are {\mu}$_g$~25.3-26.2mag
arcsec$^{-2}$. IFU spectroscopy with 13.5 hr on-source integration time were
acquired as part of an ancillary program within the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. We
stacked the 127 individual fiber spectra in each IFU in order to achieve a
1{\sigma} limiting surface brightness of 27.9mag arcsec$^{-2}$, corresponding
to a mean S/N in the optical of 21.6,9.6,and 11.6\AA$^{-1}$. We apply stellar
population models to the stacked spectra, and measure the recession velocities,
velocity dispersions ($\sigma$), stellar ages, and [Fe/H]. Our results show
that the $\sigma$ of ICL regions are very high, indicating the stars are
tracing the gravitational potential of the cluster, instead of any individual
galaxy. The line-of-sight velocities of the three ICL regions are different
from each other by ~700km/s, while the velocity of each region is similar to
the closest BCG. This suggests that the ICL regions are associated with two
distinct subclusters centered on NGC4889 and NGC4874.The stellar populations of
these regions are old and metal poor, with ages of 7-12Gyr, and [Fe/H] of -0.8
to -0.6 dex. From the derived age and [Fe/H], the build-up of ICL in Coma is
likely to be through the accretion of low mass galaxies or the tidal stripping
of the outskirts of massive galaxies that have ended their star formation early
on, instead of directly from major mergers of massive galaxies.

communication between the nodes is constrained, and so information that is
exchanged between the nodes must be quantized. Recent advances using the
distributed gradient algorithm with a quantization scheme at a fixed resolution
have established convergence, but at rates significantly slower than when the
communications are unquantized.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel quantization method, which we refer to as
adaptive quantization, that allows us to match the convergence rates under
perfect communications. Our approach adjusts the quantization scheme used by
each node as the algorithm progresses: as we approach the solution, we become
more certain about where the state variables are localized, and adapt the
quantizer codebook accordingly.
  We bound the convergence rates of the proposed method as a function of the
communication bandwidth, the underlying network topology, and structural
properties of the constituent objective functions. In particular, we show that
if the objective functions are convex or strongly convex, then using adaptive
quantization does not affect the rate of convergence of the distributed
subgradient methods when the communications are quantized, except for a
constant that depends on the resolution of the quantizer. To the best of our
knowledge, the rates achieved in this paper are better than any existing work
in the literature for distributed gradient methods under finite communication
bandwidths. We also provide numerical simulations that compare convergence
properties of the distributed gradient methods with and without quantization
for solving distributed regression problems for both quadratic and absolute

Being the most numerous and oldest stars in the galaxy, M dwarfs are
objects of great interest for exoplanet searches. The presence of molecules in

But great advances have recently been made in the modeling of M dwarfs due to
the revision of solar abundances. Aims. We aim to determine stellar parameters
of M dwarfs using high resolution spectra (R = 90 000) simultaneously in the
visible and the near-infrared. The high resolution spectra and broad wavelength
coverage provide an unique opportunity to understand the onset of dust and
cloud formation at cool temperatures. Furthermore, this study will help in
understanding the physical processes which occur in a cool atmospheres,
particularly, the redistribution of energy from the optical to the
near-infrared. Methods. The stellar parameters of M dwarfs in our sample have
been determined by comparing the high resolution spectra both in the optical
and in the near-infrared simultaneously observed by CARMENES with the synthetic
spectra obtained from the BT-Settl model atmosphere. The detailed spectral
synthesis of these observed spectra both in the optical and in the
near-infrared helps to understand the missing continuum opacity. Results. For
the first time, we derive fundamental stellar parameters of M dwarfs using the
high resolution optical and near-infrared spectra simultaneously. We determine
Teff , log g and [M/H] for 292 M dwarfs of spectral type M0 to M9, where the
formation of dust and clouds are important. The derived Teff for the sample
ranges from 2300 to 4000 K, values of log g ranges from 4.5 geq log g leq 5.5
and the resulting metallicity ranges from -0.5 geq [M/H] leq +0.5. We have also
explored the possible differences in Teff , log g and [M/H] by comparing them

medium, which in turn can also be permeated by charge carriers. The system is
defined by the charge, size, position and dielectric constant of each particle,
as well as the dielectric constant and Debye length of the medium. The effects
of taking into account the dielectric nature of the particles is explored in
selected scenarios where the presence of electrolytes in the medium can
significantly influence the total undergoing interactions. Description of the
mutual interactions between all particles in the system as being truly of
many-body nature reveals how such effects can effectively influence the
magnitudes and even directions of the resulting forces, especially those acting
on particles that have a null net charge. Particular attention is given to a
situation that can be related to colloidal particles in an electrolyte
solution, where it's shown that polarization effects alone can substantially
raise or lower---depending on the dielectric contrast between the particles and
the medium---the energy barrier that divides particle coagulation and
flocculation regions, when an interplay between electrostatic and additional
van der Waals forces is considered. Overall, the results suggest that for an
accurate description of the type of system in question, it is essential to
consider particle polarization if the separation between the interacting

phenomena are underpinned by persistent objects that can be reidentified (or
tracked) across time by observation of their distinctive properties. This
understanding is reflected in classical mechanics, which posits that matter
consists of persistent, reidentifiable particles. However, the mathematical
symmetrization procedures used to describe identical particles within the
quantum formalism have led to the widespread belief that identical quantum
particles lack either persistence or reidentifiability. However, it has proved
difficult to reconcile these assertions with the fact that identical particles
are routinely assumed to be reidentifiable in particular circumstances.
  Moreover, neither of these assertions accounts for the mathematical form of
the symmetrization procedures used to describe identical particles within the
quantum framework, leaving open theoretical possibilities other than bosonic
and fermionic behavior, such as paraparticles, which do not appear to be
realized in nature. Here we propose the novel idea that both persistence and
nonpersistence models must be employed in order to fully account for the
behaviour of identical particles. Thus, identical particles are neither
persistent nor nonpersistent. We prove the viability of this viewpoint by
showing how Feynman's and Dirac's symmetrization procedures arise through a
synthesis of a quantum treatment of these models, and by showing how
reidentifiability emerges in a context-dependent manner. We further show that
the persistence and nonpersistence models satisfy the key characteristics of
Bohr's concept of complementarity, and thereby propose that the behavior of
identical particles is a manifestation of a persistence-nonpersistence
complementarity, analogous to Bohr's wave-particle complementarity for
individual particles.

method that seeks maximally correlated variables in multi-view data. Non-linear

powerful in many real-world applications. Given the joint probability, the
Alternating Conditional Expectation (ACE) algorithm provides an optimal
solution to the non-linear CCA problem. However, it suffers from limited

we control the trade-off between the flexibility and the complexity of the

establish fundamental connections to rate-distortion theory, the information

coupled scalar field. There is a unique choice of physically meaningful `in'
vacuum here, defined with respect to the positive frequency cosmological
Kruskal modes localised on the past cosmological horizon ${\cal C^-}$, at the
onset of the collapse. We define our `out' vacuum at a fixed radial coordinate
`close' to the future cosmological horizon, ${\cal C^+}$, with respect to
positive frequency outgoing modes written in terms of the ordinary retarded
null coordinate, $u$. We trace such modes back to ${\cal C^-}$ along past
directed null geodesics through the collapsing body. Some part of the wave will
be reflected back without entering it due to the greybody effect. We show that
these two kind of traced back modes yield the two temperature spectra and
fluxes subject to the aforementioned `in' vacuum. Since the coordinate $u$ used
in the `out' modes is not well defined on a horizon, estimate on how `close' we
might be to ${\cal C^+}$ is given by estimating backreaction. We argue no other
reasonable choice of the `out' vacuum would give rise to any thermal spectra.
Our conclusions remain valid for all non-Nariai class black holes, irrespective
of the relative sizes of the two horizons.

thus crucial for the formal verification of non-terminating reactive programs
in proof assistants based on type theory, such as Coq and Agda. Currently,
programming and reasoning about coinductive types is difficult for two reasons:
The need for recursive definitions to be productive, and the lack of
coincidence of the built-in identity types and the important notion of
bisimilarity.
  Guarded recursion in the sense of Nakano has recently been suggested as a
possible approach to dealing with the problem of productivity, allowing this to
be encoded in types. Indeed, coinductive types can be encoded using a
combination of guarded recursion and universal quantification over clocks. This
paper studies the notion of bisimilarity for guarded recursive types in Ticked
Cubical Type Theory, an extension of Cubical Type Theory with guarded
recursion. We prove that, for any functor, an abstract, category theoretic
notion of bisimilarity for the final guarded coalgebra is equivalent (in the
sense of homotopy type theory) to path equality (the primitive notion of
equality in cubical type theory). As a worked example we study a guarded notion
of labelled transition systems, and show that, as a special case of the general
theorem, path equality coincides with an adaptation of the usual notion of
bisimulation for processes. In particular, this implies that guarded recursion
can be used to give simple equational reasoning proofs of bisimilarity. This
work should be seen as a step towards obtaining bisimilarity as path equality
for coinductive types using the encodings mentioned above.

microscopic friction and inertial number $I.$ For all shapes, $\tilde{\mu}$
grows from its quasi-static value $\tilde{\mu}_0$ as

expected value of a linear functional of the solution of the PDE. The proposed
algorithm combines the multivariate decomposition method (MDM), to compute
infinite dimensional integrals, with the finite element method (FEM), to solve
different instances of the PDE. The strategy of the MDFEM is to decompose the
infinite-dimensional problem into multiple finite-dimensional ones which lends
itself to easier parallelization than to solve a single large dimensional
problem. Our first result adjusts the analysis of the multivariate
decomposition method to incorporate the log-factor which typically appears in
error bounds for multivariate quadrature, i.e., cubature, methods; and we take
care of the fact that the number of points $n$ needs to come, e.g., in powers
of 2 for higher order approximations. For the further analysis we specialize
the cubature methods to be two types of quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) rules, being
digitally shifted polynomial lattice rules and interlaced polynomial lattice
rules. The second and main contribution then presents a bound on the error of
the MDFEM and shows higher-order convergence w.r.t. the total computational
cost in case of the interlaced polynomial lattice rules in combination with a
higher-order finite element method.

density loss and skeletal disorders. The adsorption, retention, diffusion, and
release of (NBPs) in bone minerals are governed by their binding affinities to
such minerals. Extensive crystal growth, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and
isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) studies have been conducted to measure
the binding affinities of NBPs to bone minerals, but the results have been
inconsistent. In this work, we examined the binding free energies of
zoledronate (ZOL), risedronate (RIS), pamidronate (PAM), alendronate (ALN), and
ibandronate (IBN) to neat and protonated hydroxyapatite (HAP) surfaces
including (001), (010), and (101) facets through molecular dynamics. Our
simulation results showed that nitrogen-containing functional groups and
surface protonation influence the binding affinities of BPs to HAP surfaces.
The hydrophilic behavior of nitrogen-containing functional groups enabled ZOL
have a larger binding free energy than RIS and IBN at neat HAP surfaces. The
protonated and slender amine groups of PAM and IBN enabled them have larger
binding free energies and wider potential wells than that of ZOL, RIS, and IBN
at neat and protonated HAP surfaces. In general, surface protonation in general
reduced the binding affinities of NBPs except protonated (010) surfaces. NBPs
preferred to immerse at the grooves of protonated (010) surfaces with high
binding free energies, and the immersions were consistent with a site-binding
model developed from (ITC) measurements. Based on our simulations results we
propose that the binding rank is ALN > PAM > ZOL > IBN > RIS which is
consistent with NMR and ITC studies, and the rank at neat (001) surfaces is ZOL
> ALN > IBN > RIS, which correlates with crystal growth studies. The simulation
results helped to unify diverged observations in the literature.

well as climate and ecological systems analysis. In addition to seasonal/annual
and diurnal oscillations, the signal is composed of different frequencies ($f$)
that modulate each other. This results in a continuous spectrum with a
power-law dependence over the entire frequency range from 1/year up to at least
1/min. Geographical location plays an important role in determining the
temporal variability of solar radiation and naturally affects its spectral
power-law decay, primarily due to the latitudinal dependence of daylight
duration and its seasonal variation,. Employing a model to calculate the clear
sky solar radiation intensity at various global locations, we show that
significant spatial variability exists, particularly versus the latitude, which
we quantify via the exponent of the spectral power-law. At most locations, the
spectral power-law dependence of the intermediate (1/day $< f <$ 1/hour)
frequencies is different from that of the high ($f > 1/$hour) frequencies. We
demonstrate the origin of this power-law dependence from simple arguments,
explain its geographic dependence and discuss the implications for photovoltaic

wide-spread discriminative approaches cannot cover such learning tasks, and
rather generative models, which attempt to learn the input density of the
foreground, are used. However, generative models suffer from a large input
dimensionality (as in images) and are typically inefficient learners. We
propose to learn the data distribution of the foreground more efficiently with
a multi-hypotheses autoencoder. Moreover, the model is criticized by a
discriminator, which prevents artificial data modes not supported by data, and
enforces diversity across hypotheses. Our multiple-hypothesesbased anomaly
detection framework allows the reliable identification of out-of-distribution
samples. For anomaly detection on CIFAR-10, it yields up to 3.9% points
improvement over previously reported results. On a real anomaly detection task,
the approach reduces the error of the baseline models from 6.8% to 1.5%.

  In the classical case when $s=d$ and $\mu$ is equal to the Lebesgue measure,
Calder\'on and Zygmund showed that if a CZO is bounded in $L^2$ then the

several examples showing that this implication may fail for lower-dimensional

extracellular recordings is the extraction of single unit activity from the
recorded multi unit signal. To identify single units (SUs), potential spikes
are detected and separated with respect to their potential neuronal origins
('spike sorting'). However, different sorting algorithms yield inconsistent
unit assignments which seriously influences the subsequent analyses of the
spiking activity. To evaluate the quality of spike sortings performed with
different prevalent algorithms offered by the 'Plexon Offline Sorter' we first
apply these algorithms to experimental data (ED), namely recordings in the
Subthalamic Nucleus of patients with Parkinson's disease, obtained during Deep
Brain Stimulation surgery. Since this procedure leaves us unsure about the best
sorting result we then apply all methods again to artificial data (AD) with
known ground truth (GT). AD consists of pairs of SUs with different shape
similarity embedded in the background noise of the ED. The sorting evaluation
is based on the influence of the respective methods on the SU assignments and
its effect on the resulting firing characteristics. We find a high variability
in the sorting results obtained by different algorithms that increases with SU
shape similarity. We also find significant differences in the resulting firing
characteristics of the ED. We conclude that Valley-Seeking produces the most
accurate results if the exclusion of artifacts as unsorted events is important.
If the latter is less important ('clean' data) K-Means is a better option. Our
results strongly argue for the need of standardized validation procedures for
spike sorting based on GT data. The recipe suggested here is simple enough to
become a standard procedure.

experimentally, numerically and theoretically. At odds with usual models of
self-propelled particles, we identify two dynamical states for which the
particle condensates at finite distance from the trap center. In the first
state, also found in other systems, the particle points radially outward the
trap, while diffusing along the azimuthal direction. In the second state, the
particle performs circular orbits around the center of the trap. We show that
self-alignment, taking the form of a torque coupling the particle orientation
and velocity, is responsible for the emergence of this second dynamical state.
The transition between the two states is controlled by the persistence of the
particle orientation. At low inertia, the transition is continuous. For large
inertia the transition is discontinuous and a coexistence regime with
intermittent dynamics develops. The two states survive in the over-damped limit
or when the particle is confined by a curved hard wall.

can help doctors make better informed treatment decisions. Magnetic resonance

standard for diagnosis. Automated stroke lesion segmentation can provide with
an estimate of the location and volume of the lesioned tissue, which can help
in the clinical practice to better assess and evaluate the risks of each
treatment. We propose a deep learning methodology for acute and sub-acute
stroke lesion segmentation using multimodal MR imaging. The proposed method is
evaluated using two public datasets from the 2015 Ischemic Stroke Lesion
Segmentation challenge (ISLES 2015). These involve the tasks of sub-acute
stroke lesion segmentation (SISS) and acute stroke penumbra estimation (SPES)
from diffusion, perfusion and anatomical MRI modalities. The performance is
compared against state-of-the-art methods with a blind online testing set
evaluation on each of the challenges. At the time of submitting this
manuscript, our approach is the first method in the online rankings for the
SISS (DSC=0.59$\pm$0.31) and SPES sub-tasks (DSC=0.84$\pm$0.10). When compared
with the rest of submitted strategies, we achieve top rank performance with a
lower Hausdorff distance. Better segmentation results are obtained by
leveraging the anatomy and pathophysiology of acute stroke lesions and using a
combined approach to minimize the effects of class imbalance. The same training
procedure is used for both tasks, showing the proposed methodology can
generalize well enough to deal with different unrelated tasks and imaging
modalities without training hyper-parameter tuning. A public version of the

the cutoff power-law spectrum typical for accreting pulsars, including GX 304-1

transformed at lower luminosity of $L_{\rm X}\sim 10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to a

observed transition corresponds to a change of the dominant mechanism
responsible for the deceleration of the accretion flow. We argue that the
accretion flow energy at low accretion rates is released in the atmosphere of
the neutron star, and the low-energy component in the source spectrum
corresponds to the thermal emission of the optically thick, heated atmospheric
layers. The most plausible explanations for the high-energy component are
either the cyclotron emission reprocessed by the magnetic Compton scattering or
the thermal radiation of deep atmospheric layers partly Comptonized in the
overheated upper layers. Alternative scenarios are also discussed.

studied extensively due to its importance in engineering and its prevalence in
natural structures. Varying the flow speed can give rise to a range of dynamics
including limit cycle behaviour and chaotic motion of the cantilevered sheet.
Recently, the ""inverted flag"" configuration - a cantilevered elastic sheet
aligned with the flow impinging on its free edge - has been observed to produce
large-amplitude flapping over a finite band of flow speeds. This flapping
phenomenon has been found to be a vortex-induced vibration, and only occurs at
sufficiently large Reynolds numbers. In all cases studied, the inverted flag
has been formed from a cantilevered sheet of rectangular morphology, i.e. the
planform of its elastic sheet is a rectangle. Here, we investigate the effect
of the inverted flag's morphology on its resulting stability and dynamics. We
choose a trapezoidal planform which is explored using experiment and an
analytical theory for the divergence instability of an inverted flag of
arbitrary morphology. Strikingly, for this planform we observe that the flow
speed range over which flapping occurs scales approximately with the flow speed
at which the divergence instability occurs. This provides a means by which to
predict and control flapping. In a biological setting, leaves in a wind can
also align themselves in an inverted flag configuration. Motivated by this
natural occurrence we also study the effect of adding an artificial ""petiole""
(a thin elastic stalk that connects the sheet to the clamp) on the inverted
flag's dynamics. We find that the petiole serves to partially decouple fluid
forces from elastic forces and increases the freedom by which the flapping
dynamics can be tuned. These results highlight the intricacies of the flapping
instability and account for some of the varied dynamics of leaves in nature.

and post-Newtonian approximations, we calculate analytically the scalar field
and the gravitomagnetic sector of the gravitational field in the interior and
the exterior of an isolated, weakly-gravitating object with uniform rotation
and a quadrupolar mass deformation. We find that the asymptotic peeling-off
behavior of the exterior fields is consistent with that found for black holes
and neutron stars, as well as for non-relativistic objects, with overall
coefficients that are different and dependent on the structure of the
weak-field source. We then use these fields to explicitly calculate the
dynamical Chern-Simons correction to the spin precession of gyroscopes in orbit
around Earth, which we find to be in the same direction as the Lense-Thirring
effect of General Relativity. We then compare this correction to the spin
precession prediction of General Relativity to the results of the Gravity Probe
B experiment to place a constraint on dynamical Chern-Simons theory that is
consistent with previous approximate estimates. Although we focus primarily on
a single body, our methods can be straightforwardly extended to binary systems

problems that are NP-hard in general become solvable in polynomial time on
chordal graphs, whereas many others remain NP-hard. For a large group of
problems among the latter, approximation algorithms, parameterized algorithms,
and algorithms with moderately exponential or sub-exponential running time have
been designed. Chordal graphs have also gained increasing interest during the
recent years in the area of enumeration algorithms. Being able to test these
algorithms on instances of chordal graphs is crucial for understanding the
concepts of tractability of hard problems on graph classes. Unfortunately, only
few studies give algorithms for generating chordal graphs. Even in these
papers, only very few methods aim for generating a large variety of chordal
graphs. Surprisingly, none of these methods is directly based on the
""intersection of subtrees of a tree"" characterization of chordal graphs. In
this paper, we give an algorithm for generating chordal graphs, based on the
characterization that a graph is chordal if and only if it is the intersection
graph of subtrees of a tree. Upon generating a random host tree, we give and
test various methods that generate subtrees of the host tree. We compare our
methods to one another and to existing ones for generating chordal graphs. Our
experiments show that one of our methods is able to generate the largest
variety of chordal graphs in terms of maximal clique sizes. Moreover, two of
our subtree generation methods result in an overall complexity of our
generation algorithm that is the best possible time complexity for a method
generating the entire node set of subtrees in a ""intersection of subtrees of a

  Journal",,"10.3847/1538-4357/ab1f74",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cosmological cluster-scale strong gravitational lensing probes the mass
distribution of the dense cores of massive dark matter halos and the structures
along the line of sight from background sources to the observer. It is
frequently assumed that the primary lens mass dominates the lensing, with the
contribution of secondary masses along the line of sight being neglected.
Secondary mass structures may, however, affect both the detectability of strong
lensing in a given survey and modify the properties of the lensing that is
detected. In this paper, we utilize a large cosmological N-body simulation and
a multiple lens plane (and many source planes) ray-tracing technique to
quantify the influence of line of sight halos on the detectability of
cluster-scale strong lensing in a cluster sample with a mass limit that
encompasses current cluster catalogs from the South Pole Telescope. We extract
both primary and secondary halos from the ""Outer Rim"" simulation and consider
two strong lensing realizations: one with only the primary halos included, and
the other contains all secondary halos down to a mass limit. In both cases, we
use the same source information extracted from the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, and
create realistic lensed images consistent with moderately deep ground-based
imaging. The results demonstrate that down to the mass limit considered the
total number of lenses is boosted by about 13-21% when considering the complete
multi-halo lightcone. The increment in strong lens counts peaks at lens
redshifts of 0.6 approximately with no significant effect at z<0.3. The
strongest trends are observed relative to the primary halo mass, with no
significant impact in the most massive quintile of the halo sample, but
increasingly boosting the observed lens counts toward small primary halo
masses, with an enhancement greater than 50% in the least massive quintile of
the halo masses considered.

weights be recovered? This problem has broad applications in fields such as
sonars, seismol-ogy, ultrasounds or room acoustics. It belongs to the broader
class of blind channel identification problems, which have been intensively
studied in signal processing. Existing methods in the literature proceed in two
steps: (i) blind estimation of sparse discrete-time filters and (ii) echo
information retrieval by peak-picking on filters. The precision of these
methods is fundamentally limited by the rate at which the signals are sampled:
estimated echo locations are necessary on-grid, and since true locations never
match the sampling grid, the weight estimation precision is impacted. This is
the so-called basis-mismatch problem in compressed sensing. We propose a
radically different approach to the problem, building on the framework of
finite-rate-of-innovation sampling. The approach operates directly in the
parameter-space of echo locations and weights, and enables near-exact blind and
off-grid echo retrieval from discrete-time measurements. It is shown to
outperform conventional methods by several orders of magnitude in precision.

effect (TMOKE) is a sensitive method for investigation of magnetically-ordered
media. However, in magnetic materials the optical transitions are usually
characterized by spectrally broad resonances with widths considerably exceeding
the Zeeman splitting in the magnetic field. Here we investigate experimentally
and theoretically the TMOKE in the vicinity of relatively narrow optical
resonances provided by confined quantum systems. For experimental demonstration
we use the exciton resonance in a (Cd,Mn)Te diluted magnetic semiconductor
quantum well, where the strong exchange interaction with magnetic ions enables
the giant Zeeman splitting of exciton spin states $\Delta$ in magnetic fields
of a few Tesla. In the weak coupling regime, when the splitting $\Delta$ is
smaller than the spectral broadening of the optical transitions $\Gamma$, the
TMOKE magnitude grows linearly with the increase of the Zeeman splitting and
its spectrum has an S-shape, which remains virtually unchanged in this range.
In the strong coupling regime ($\Delta>\Gamma$) the TMOKE magnitude saturates,
while its spectrum is strongly modified resulting in the appearance of two
separate peaks. The TMOKE is sensitive not only to the sample surface but can
be used to probe the confined electronic states in depth if the upper layer is
sufficiently transparent. Our results demonstrate that TMOKE of spectrally
narrow resonances serves as a versatile tool for probing the charge and spin
structure of electronic states in various confined quantum systems and can be
used for spin tomography in combination with the conventional polar Kerr
effect.

that the graph edges are generated based on the community structure model.
Given the labeling of the edges of the first graph, the objective is to recover
the labels in the second graph. The problem is considered under two scenarios:
i) with side-information where the community membership of the nodes in both
graphs are known, and ii) without side-information where the community
memberships are not known. A matching scheme is proposed which operates based
on typicality of the adjacency matrices of the graphs. Achievability results
are derived which provide theoretical guarantees for successful matching under
specific assumptions on graph parameters. It is observed that for the proposed
matching scheme, the conditions for successful matching do not change in the
presence of side-information. Furthermore, a converse result is derived which
characterizes a set of graph parameters for which matching is not possible.

submodular function $f$ over a ground set $E$ of items, and the goal is to

In the stochastic version of the problem, we are given $m$ stochastic items
which are different random variables that independently realize to some item in

the stochastic set cover problem and more generally, stochastic covering
integer programs.
  We define an $r$-round adaptive algorithm to be an algorithm that chooses a
permutation of all available items in each round $k \in [r]$, and a threshold
$\tau_k$, and realizes items in the order specified by the permutation until
the function value is at least $\tau_k$. The permutation for each round $k$ is
chosen adaptively based on the realization in the previous rounds, but the

their operation may accelerate their degradation and may cause an inhomogeneous
brightness distribution, in particular in large area OLEDs. Assessing the
quantitative impact of heat excess is difficult, because all decisive processes
related to charge transport and emission via charge recombination are thermally
activated. For example, electric currents that are elevated due to larger
temperatures cause additional Joule heating and increase, hence, the device
temperature even further. Here we establish how parameters responsible for heat
transport, i.e., the thermal conductivity of the organic layers and the heat
transfer coefficient between the device surface and the environment govern the
temperature inside the OLED. We establish, relying on three-dimensional
drift-diffusion simulations that self-consistently couple thermally-activated
charge transport and heat transport, that the thermal conductivity of organic
layers is not a bottleneck for heat transport, because the encountered layer
thicknesses in realistic device geometries prevent heat accumulation. The heat
transfer to the ambient environment is the key parameter to dissipate excess
heat from the device. Intentionally elevated operating temperatures, that may
improve the OLEDs electric performance, are not necessarily beneficial, as any
increase in operating temperature decreases the device stability. The thermal
effects being decisive for the OLED temperature occur in device layers beyond
the electrically active region. We propose analytical expressions that relate
the temperature in the device for a given point of operation to the heat
transfer to the environment and the substrate.

Taylor-Couette flow subject to axial uniform magnetic field is analysed. The
flow has been extensively studied since early 90's as the magneto-rotational
instability (MRI) occurring in the flow could possibly explain the origin of
the instability observed in certain astrophysical objects. Elsewhere the ideal
approximation has been used to study high-speed flows, whilst it sometimes
produces paradoxical results. For example, ideal flows must be completely
stabilised for strong enough applied magnetic field, but on the other hand the
vanishing magnetic Prandtl number limit of the stability should be purely
hydrodynamic so instability must occur when Rayleigh's stability condition is
violated. The first our discovery is that this apparent contradiction can be
resolved by showing the abrupt appearance of the hydrodynamic instability at
certain critical value of magnetic Prandtl number, which can be found by
asymptotically large Reynolds number limit but with long enough wavelength to
retain some diffusive effects. The second our finding concerns so-called
Velikhov-Chandrasekhar paradox, namely the mismatch of the zero external
magnetic field limit of the Velikhov-Chandrasekhar stability criterion and
Rayleigh's stability criterion. We show for fully wide gap cases that the high
Reynolds number asymptotic analysis of the MRI naturally yields the simple
stability condition that describes smooth transition from Rayleigh to
Velikhov-Chandrasekhar stability criteria with increasing Lundquist number.

only a single network, trained using only a single cost function: maximizing
the likelihood of the training data, which makes the training procedure simple

than 500 kHz on an NVIDIA V100 GPU. Mean Opinion Scores show that it delivers

wastewater treatment. A pseudo-mechanistic model describing three biological
pathways for nitric oxide (NO) and N2O production was calibrated for mixed
culture biomass from an activated sludge process using laboratory-scale
experiments. The model (NDHA) comprehensively describes N2O producing pathways
by both autotrophic ammonium oxidizing bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria.
Extant respirometric assays and anaerobic batch experiments were designed to
calibrate endogenous and exogenous processes (heterotrophic denitrification and
autotrophic ammonium/nitrite oxidation) together with the associated net N2O
production. Ten parameters describing heterotrophic processes and seven for
autotrophic processes were accurately estimated (variance/mean < 25%). The
model predicted NO and N2O dynamics at varying dissolved oxygen, ammonium and
nitrite levels and was validated against an independent set of experiments with
the same biomass. Aerobic ammonium oxidation experiments at two oxygen levels
used for model evaluation (2 and 0.5 mg/L) indicated that both the nitrifier
denitrification (42, 64%) and heterotrophic denitrification (7, 17%) pathways
increased and dominated N2O production at high nitrite and low oxygen
concentrations; while the nitrifier nitrification pathway showed the largest
contribution at high dissolved oxygen levels (51, 19%). The uncertainty of the
biological parameter estimates was propagated to N2O model outputs via Monte
Carlo simulations as 95% confidence intervals. The accuracy of the estimated
parameters resulted in a low uncertainty of the N2O emission factors (4.6 +-
0.6% and 1.2 +- 0.1%).

in this paper, we aim to design a controlled-release drug delivery system with
a mobile drug carrier that minimizes the total amount of released drugs while
ensuring a desired rate of drug absorption during a prescribed time period. We
model the mobile drug carrier as a mobile transmitter, the targeted diseased
cells as an absorbing receiver, and the channel between the transceivers as a
time-variant channel since the carrier mobility results in a time-variant
absorption rate of the drug molecules. Based on this, we develop a molecular
communication (MC) framework to design the controlled-release drug delivery
system. In particular, we develop new analytical expressions for the mean,
variance, probability density function, and cumulative distribution function of
the channel impulse response (CIR). Equipped with the statistical analysis of
the CIR, we design and evaluate the performance of the controlled-release drug
delivery system. Numerical results show significant savings in the amount of
released drugs compared to a constant-release rate design and reveal the
necessity of accounting for drug carrier mobility for reliable drug delivery.

  identification","affiliations changed",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The functional relationship between an input and a sensory neuron's response
can be described by the neuron's stimulus-response mapping function. A general
approach for characterizing the stimulus-response mapping function is called
system identification. Many different names have been used for the
stimulus-response mapping function: kernel or transfer function, transducer,
spatiotemporal receptive field. Many algorithms have been developed to estimate
a neuron's mapping function from an ensemble of stimulus-response pairs. These
include the spike-triggered average, normalized reverse correlation, linearized
reverse correlation, ridge regression, local spectral reverse correlation,
spike-triggered covariance, artificial neural networks, maximally informative
dimensions, kernel regression, boosting, and models based on leaky
integrate-and-fire neurons. Because many of these system identification
algorithms were developed in other disciplines, they seem very different
superficially and bear little relationship with each other. Each algorithm
makes different assumptions about the neuron and how the data is generated.
Without a unified framework it is difficult to select the most suitable
algorithm for estimating the neuron's mapping function. In this review, we
present a unified framework for describing these algorithms called maximum a
posteriori estimation (MAP). In the MAP framework, the implicit assumptions
built into any system identification algorithm are made explicit in three MAP
constituents: model class, noise distributions, and priors. Understanding the
interplay between these three MAP constituents will simplify the task of
selecting the most appropriate algorithms for a given data set. The MAP
framework can also facilitate the development of novel system identification
algorithms by incorporating biophysically plausible assumptions and mechanisms
into the MAP constituents.

results in various applications. In the case of image recognition, an ideal
model has to learn independently of the training data, both local dependencies
between the three components (R,G,B) of a pixel, and the global relations
describing edges or shapes, making it efficient with small or heterogeneous
datasets. Quaternion-valued convolutional neural networks (QCNN) solved this
problematic by introducing multidimensional algebra to CNN. This paper proposes
to explore the fundamental reason of the success of QCNN over CNN, by
investigating the impact of the Hamilton product on a color image
reconstruction task performed from a gray-scale only training. By learning
independently both internal and external relations and with less parameters
than real valued convolutional encoder-decoder (CAE), quaternion convolutional
encoder-decoders (QCAE) perfectly reconstructed unseen color images while CAE
produced worst and gray-scale versions.

risks and security concerns about the transfer and the logging of data

blockchain technology. However, one of the primary problems with blockchain is
its highly limited scalability. In this work here, we propose the utilization
of a blockchain based protocol to provide secure management and analysis of

that generalizes Satoshi's blockchain to a direct acyclic graph of blocks
(blockDAG) and provides high throughput while also avoiding the
security-scalability problem. We use two blockchains based on the original
GHOSTDAG protocol, one that is private and one that is public. Using a private
blockchain, we create a system where we use smart contracts to analyze patient
health data. If the smart contract for any reason issues an alert for an
abnormal reading then the system makes the record of that event to the public
blockchain. This would resolve the privacy and security vulnerabilities
associated with remote patient monitoring and also the limited scalability

regime of radiation reaction or even the fully non-perturbative regime of
quantum electrodynamics. The scheme considers the collision of a 100 GeV-class
electron beam with a counterpropagating ultraintense electromagnetic pulse. To
reach these supercritical regimes, it is unavoidable to use a pulse with
ultrashort duration. Using two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, it is
therefore shown how one can convert a next-generation optical laser to an
ultraintense ($I\approx 2.9\times 10^{24} \text{ W} \, \text{cm}^{-2}$)
attosecond (duration $\approx$ 150 as) pulse. It is shown that if the
perturbation theory persists in extremely fields, the spectrum of secondary

experimental data may allow differentiating the contribution of high-order
radiative corrections if the perturbation theory breaks.

the problem through a deep hybrid generative-discriminative model, which is

vehicular ad hoc networks(VANETs), the control channel (CCH) is dedicated to
broadcast safety messages while the service channels (SCH's) are dedicated to
transmit infotainment service content. However, the SCH can be used as an
alternative to transmit high priority safety messages in the event that they
are invoked during the service channel interval (SCHI). This implies that there
is a need to transmit safety messages across multiple available utilized
channels to ensure that all vehicles receive the safety message. Transmission
across multiple SCH's using the legacy IEEE 1609.4 requires multiple channel
switching and therefore introduces further end-to-end delays. Given that safety
messaging is a life critical application, it is important that optimal
end-to-end delay performance is derived in multi-channel VANET scenarios to
ensure reliable safety message dissemination. To tackle this challenge, three
primary contributions are in this article: first, a channel coordinator
selection approach based on the least average separation distance (LAD) to the
vehicles that expect to tune to other SCH's and operates during the control
channel interval (CCHI) is proposed. Second, a model to determine the optimal
time intervals in which CMD operates during the CCHI is proposed. Third, a
contention back-off mechanism for safety message transmission during the SCHI

performs better than the legacy IEEE 1609.4 and a selected state-of-the-art
