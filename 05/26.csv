to efficiently simulate slow dynamics over long time intervals. For stochastic
systems, one often aims at resolving the statistics of the slowest dynamics.
This paper looks at the efficiency of a micro-macro acceleration method that
couples short bursts of stochastic path simulation with extrapolation of
spatial averages forward in time. To have explicit derivations, we elicit an
amenable linear test equation containing multiple time scales. We make
derivations and perform numerical experiments in the Gaussian setting, where
only the evolution of mean and variance matters. The analysis shows that, for
this test model, the stability threshold on the extrapolation step is largely
independent of the time-scale separation. In consequence, the micro-macro
acceleration method increases the admissible time steps far beyond those for
which a direct time discretization becomes unstable.

advancement of quantum computing, existing and near-term quantum computers are
not yet large enough to fully support quantum error-correction. Such systems
with few tens to few hundreds of qubits are termed as Noisy Intermediate Scale
Quantum computers (NISQ), and these systems can provide benefits for a class of
quantum algorithms. In this paper, we study the problems of Qubit-Allocation
(mapping of program qubits to machine qubits) and Qubit-Movement(routing qubits
from one location to another to perform entanglement).
  We observe that there exists variation in the error rates of different qubits
and links, which can have an impact on the decisions for qubit movement and
qubit allocation. We analyze characterization data for the IBM-Q20 quantum
computer gathered over 52 days to understand and quantify the variation in the
error-rates and find that there is indeed significant variability in the error
rates of the qubits and the links connecting them. We define reliability
metrics for NISQ computers and show that the device variability has the
substantial impact on the overall system reliability. To exploit the
variability in error rate, we propose Variation-Aware Qubit Movement (VQM) and
Variation-Aware Qubit Allocation (VQA), policies that optimize the movement and
allocation of qubits to avoid the weaker qubits and links and guide more
operations towards the stronger qubits and links. We show that our
Variation-Aware policies improve the reliability of the NISQ system up to 2.5x.

techniques, allowing a precise identification of the materials in the observed
scene, but because of the limited spatial resolution, the observations are
usually mixtures of the contributions of several materials. The spectral
unmixing problem aims at recovering the spectra of the pure materials of the
scene (endmembers), along with their proportions (abundances) in each pixel. In
order to deal with the intra-class variability of the materials and the induced
spectral variability of the endmembers, several spectra per material,
constituting endmember bundles, can be considered. However, the usual abundance
estimation techniques do not take advantage of the particular structure of
these bundles, organized into groups of spectra. In this paper, we propose to
use group sparsity by introducing mixed norms in the abundance estimation
optimization problem. In particular, we propose a new penalty which
simultaneously enforces group and within group sparsity, to the cost of being
nonconvex. All the proposed penalties are compatible with the abundance
sum-to-one constraint, which is not the case with traditional sparse
regression. We show on simulated and real datasets that well chosen penalties
can significantly improve the unmixing performance compared to the naive bundle
approach.

propose two different techniques to modify the network topology while
preserving its dynamical behaviour. In the region of parameters where the
homogeneous solution gets spontaneously destabilized, perturbations grow along
the unstable directions made available across the networks of connections,
yielding irregular spatio-temporal patterns. We exploit the spectral properties
of the Laplacian operator associated to the graph in order to modify its
topology, while preserving the unstable manifold of the underlying equilibrium.
The new network is isodynamic to the former, meaning that it reproduces the
dynamical response (pattern) to a perturbation, as displayed by the original
system. The first method acts directly on the eigenmodes, thus resulting in a
general redistribution of link weights which, in some cases, can completely
change the structure of the original network. The second method uses
localization properties of the eigenvectors to identify and randomize a
subnetwork that is mostly embedded only into the stable manifold. We test both
techniques on different network topologies using the Ginzburg-Landau system as
a reference model. Whereas the correlation between patterns on isodynamic
networks generated via the first recipe is larger, the second method allows for
a finer control at the level of single nodes. This work opens up a new
perspective on the multiple possibilities for identifying the family of
discrete supports that instigate equivalent dynamical responses on a

interpretation calls for multiscale computational models with corresponding
spatial dimensions and signal predictions. Such models can facilitate the
search of mechanisms underlying observed spatiotemporal activity patterns in
cortex. Multi-layer spiking neuron network models of local cortical circuits
covering ~1 mm$^2$ have been developed, integrating experimentally obtained
neuron-type specific connectivity data and reproducing features of in-vivo
spiking statistics. With forward models, local field potentials (LFPs) can be
computed from the simulated spiking activity. To account for the spatial scale
of common neural recordings, we extend a local network and LFP model to 4x4
mm$^2$. The upscaling preserves the neuron densities, and introduces
distance-dependent connection probabilities and delays. As detailed
experimental connectivity data is partially lacking, we address this
uncertainty in model parameters by testing parameter combinations within
biologically plausible bounds. Based on model predictions of spiking activity
and LFPs, we find that the upscaling procedure preserves the overall spiking
statistics of the original model and reproduces asynchronous irregular spiking
across populations and weak pairwise spike-train correlations observed in
sensory cortex. In contrast with the weak spike-train correlations, the
correlation of LFP signals is strong and distance-dependent, compatible with

infinite sequences, as recently proven by Terence Tao, attempts were made to
construct such sequences with finite lengths. We recognize that such

hallmarks of randomness at the local level: they show roughly equal frequencies
of subsequences, and at the same time exclude the trivial periodic patterns.
For the human DNA we examine the frequency of a set of Erdos motifs of

Erdos sequence is derived by the length-11 Mathias sequence and is identical
with the first 10 digits of the Thue-Morse sequence, underscoring the fact that
both are deficient in periodicities. Our calculations indicate that: (1) the

every x is the spurious local minimum of a rank-1 instance of matrix recovery

Specifically, we seek to provide insight about the retrievability of URIs of

Google every day for over seven months (2017-05-25 to 2018-01-12) and collected
links from the first five SERPs to generate seven collections for each query.
The queries represent public interest stories: ""healthcare bill,"" ""manchester
bombing,"" ""london terrorism,"" ""trump russia,"" ""travel ban,"" ""hurricane harvey,""
and ""hurricane irma."" We tracked each URI in all collections over time to
estimate the discoverability of URIs from the first five SERPs. Our results
showed that the daily average rate at which stories were replaced on the
default Google SERP ranged from 0.21 -0.54, and a weekly rate of 0.39 - 0.79,
suggesting the fast replacement of older stories by newer stories. The
probability of finding the same URI of a news story after one day from the
initial appearance on the SERP ranged from 0.34 - 0.44. After a week, the
probability of finding the same news stories diminishes rapidly to 0.01 - 0.11.

vortex lattice in a dilute superfluid gas of bosonic atoms at zero temperature
along the crossover from the weak-coupling regime, where the inter-atomic
scattering length is very small compared to the average distance between atoms,
to the unitarity regime, where the inter-atomic scattering length diverges.
This study is based on high-performance numerical simulations of the
time-dependent nonlinear Schrodinger equation for the superfluid order
parameter in three spatial dimensions, using a realistic analytic expression
for the bulk equation of state of the system along the crossover from
weak-coupling to unitarity. This equation of state has the correct
weak-coupling and unitarity limits and faithfully reproduces the results of an
accurate multi-orbital microscopic calculation. Our numerical predictions of
the number of vortices and root-mean-square sizes are important benchmarks for

distributions in terms of their dependence structure. While there are
algorithms with provable guarantees for learning undirected graphical models in
a variety of settings, there has been much less progress in the important
scenario when there are latent variables. Here we study Restricted Boltzmann
Machines (or RBMs), which are a popular model with wide-ranging applications in
dimensionality reduction, collaborative filtering, topic modeling, feature
extraction and deep learning.
  The main message of our paper is a strong dichotomy in the feasibility of
learning RBMs, depending on the nature of the interactions between variables:
ferromagnetic models can be learned efficiently, while general models cannot.
In particular, we give a simple greedy algorithm based on influence
maximization to learn ferromagnetic RBMs with bounded degree. In fact, we learn
a description of the distribution on the observed variables as a Markov Random
Field. Our analysis is based on tools from mathematical physics that were
developed to show the concavity of magnetization. Our algorithm extends
straighforwardly to general ferromagnetic Ising models with latent variables.
  Conversely, we show that even for a contant number of latent variables with
constant degree, without ferromagneticity the problem is as hard as sparse
parity with noise. This hardness result is based on a sharp and surprising
characterization of the representational power of bounded degree RBMs: the
distribution on their observed variables can simulate any bounded order MRF.
This result is of independent interest since RBMs are the building blocks of
deep belief networks.

surface of lithium diffusing in a solid-state ionic conductor. First, we assume
that the Li atoms are fully ionized and we neglect the weak dependence of the
electronic valence charge density on the instantaneous position of the Li ions.
Second, we freeze the atoms of the host lattice in their equilibrium positions;
consequently, also the valence charge density is frozen. We thus obtain a
computational setup (the ""pinball model"") for which extremely inexpensive
molecular dynamics simulation can be performed. To assess the accuracy of the
model, we contrast it with full first-principles molecular dynamics simulations
performed either with a free or frozen host lattice; in this latter case, the
charge density still readjusts itself self-consistently to the actual positions
of the diffusing Li ions. We show that the pinball model is able to reproduce
accurately the static and dynamic properties of the diffusing Li ions -
including forces, power spectra, and diffusion coefficients - when compared to
the self-consistent frozen-host lattice simulations. The frozen-lattice
approximation itself is often accurate enough, and certainly a good proxy in
most materials. These observations unlock efficient ways to simulating the
diffusion of lithium in the solid state, and provide additional physical
insight into the respective roles of charge-density rearrangements or lattice

redshift distribution of binary black hole (BBH) mergers. The evolution of the
merger rate across redshifts $0 < z \lesssim 1$ is directly tied to the
formation and evolutionary processes, providing insight regarding the
progenitor formation rate together with the distribution of time delays between
formation and merger. Because the limiting distance to which BBHs are detected
depends on the masses of the binary, the redshift distribution of detected
binaries depends on their underlying mass distribution. We therefore consider
the mass and redshift distributions simultaneously, and fit the merger rate
density, ${dN}/{dm_1\,dm_2\,dz}$. Our constraints on the mass distribution
agree with previously published results, including evidence for an upper mass
cutoff at $\sim 40 \ M_\odot$. Additionally, we show that the current set of
six BBH detections are consistent with a merger rate density that is uniform in
comoving volume. Although our constraints on the redshift distribution are not
yet tight enough to distinguish between BBH formation channels, we show that it
will be possible to distinguish between different astrophysically motivated
models of the merger rate evolution with $\sim 100$--$300$ LIGO-Virgo
detections (to be expected within 2--5 years). Specifically, we will be able to
infer whether the formation rate peaks at higher or lower redshifts than the
star formation rate, or the typical time delay between formation and merger.
Meanwhile, with $\sim 100$ detections, the inferred redshift distribution will
place constraints on more exotic scenarios such as modified gravity.

derive a relationship in general dimensions between the trace of the

realization, both theoretical and experimental, is of great interest. On the
one hand, such systems are motivated from a quantum information point of view.
On the other hand, they can provide a framework for simulating systems with
enhanced capacity of pattern storage, such as black holes and neural networks.
In this paper, we develop an analytic method that enables us to find critical
states with increased storage capabilities in a generic system of cold bosons
with weak attractive interactions. The enhancement of memory capacity arises
when the occupation number $N$ of certain modes reaches a critical level. Such
modes, via negative energy couplings, assist others in becoming effectively
gapless. This leads to degenerate microstates labeled by the occupation numbers
of the nearly-gapless modes. In the limit of large $N$, they become exactly
gapless and their decoherence time diverges. In this way, a system becomes an
ideal storer of quantum information. We demonstrate our method on a prototype
model of $N$ attractive cold bosons contained in a one-dimensional box with
Dirichlet boundary conditions. Although we limit ourselves to a truncated
system, we observe a rich structure of quantum phases with a critical point of
enhanced memory capacity.

questions is that it is difficult to measure neutrino properties outside of the
ultrarelativistic regime. We discuss the physics of $e\gamma\to e\nu\bar{\nu}$

nonrelativistic neutrinos. Near threshold, $e\gamma\to e\nu\bar{\nu}$ is a rich
phenomenon and its cross section is sensitive to the individual values of the

fermions. In practice, however, event rates are tiny and backgrounds are huge;

high-resolution equal-mass merger simulations including SMBHs to study the
formation of such systems. The structural parameters of the progenitor
ellipticals were chosen to produce merger remnants resembling NGC 1600. We test
initial stellar density slopes of $\rho \propto r^{-1}$ and $\rho \propto

systematic decrease in central surface brightness, an increasing core size, and
an increasingly tangentially biased central velocity anisotropy.
Two-dimensional kinematic maps reveal decoupled, rotating core regions for the
most massive SMBHs. The stellar cores form rapidly as the SMBHs become bound,
while the velocity anisotropy develops more slowly after the SMBH binaries
become hard. The simulated merger remnants follow distinct relations between
the core radius and the sphere-of-influence, and the SMBH mass, similar to
observed systems. We find a systematic change in the relations as a function of
the progenitor density slope, and present a simple scouring model reproducing
this behavior. Finally, we find the best agreement with NGC 1600 using SMBH
masses totaling the observed value of $M_\bullet = 1.7 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$.

recover Lorentz invariance at low energy are the possibilities that (1) the
renormalization group flow of the system leads to emergent infrared Lorentz
invariance, and (2) that supersymmetry protects infrared Lorentz invariance. A
third scenario proposes that a classically Lorentz invariant matter sector with
controlled quantum corrections may simply co-exist with Horava gravity under
certain conditions. However, for non-projectable Horava gravity in 3+1
dimensions it is known that, in the absence of additional structures, this
mechanism is spoiled by unexpected power-law divergences. We confirm this same
result in the projectable version of the theory by employing the recently found
gauge-fixing term that renders the shift and graviton propagators regular. We
show that the problem persists for all dimensions $D\geq 3$, and that the
degree of fine tuning in squared sound speeds between a U(1) gauge field and a
scalar field increases with $D$. In particular, this difference in the zero
external momentum limit is proportional to $\Lambda^{D-1}$ for $D\geq 3$, where
$\Lambda$ is the ultraviolet momentum cutoff for loop integrals, while the
power-law divergences are absent for $D=1$ and $D=2$. These results suggest
that not only the gravity sector but also the matter sector should exhibit a
transition to Lifshitz scaling above some scale, and that there should not be a
large separation between the transition scales in the gravity and matter
sectors. We close with a discussion of other more promising scenarios,
including emergent Lorentz invariance from supersymmetry/strong dynamics, and
pointing out challenges where they exist.

can be naturally obtained by freezeout of weak-scale dark matter annihilations
in the early universe. This ""thermal WIMP"" scenario makes direct predictions
for the total annihilation cross section that can be tested in present-day

$m_\chi\gtrsim100$ GeV for particular annihilation channels, the constraint on

that allowed combinations of the annihilation-channel branching ratios
considerably weaken the sensitivity. For thermal WIMPs with s-wave
$2\rightarrow2$ annihilation to visible final states, we find the dark matter

model-independent lower limit on the mass of thermal-relic WIMPs, together with
the upper limit on the mass from the unitarity bound ($m_\chi\lesssim 100$

financial crisis of the late 2000s. Organizations are tensely forced to
leverage their core competencies to survive through attracting more customers
and gaining more efficacious operations. In such a situation, diversified
corporations which run multiple businesses have opportunities to get
competitive advantage and differentiate themselves by executing horizontal
strategy. Since this strategy completely engages a number of business units of
a diversified corporation through resource sharing among them, any effort to
implement it will fail if being not supported by enough information. However,
for successful execution of horizontal strategy, managers should have reliable
information concerning its success probability in advance. To provide such a
precious information, a three-step framework has been developed. In the first
step, major influencers on successful execution of horizontal strategy have
been captured through literature study and interviewing subject matter experts.
In the second step through the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory
(DEMATEL) methodology, critical success factors (CSFs) have been extracted from
major influencers and a success probability assessment index system (SPAIS) has
been formed. In the third step, due to the statistical nature (multivariate and
distribution free) of SPAIS, an artificial neural network has been designed for
enabling organizational managers to forecast the success probability of
horizontal strategy execution in a multi-business corporation far better than
other classical models.

policy-gradients and Q-learning, relies heavily on the availability of an
informative reward signal at each timestep of the sequential decision-making
process. When rewards are only sparsely available during an episode, or a
rewarding feedback is provided only after episode termination, these algorithms
perform sub-optimally due to the difficultly in credit assignment.
Alternatively, trajectory-based policy optimization methods, such as
cross-entropy method and evolution strategies, do not require per-timestep
rewards, but have been found to suffer from high sample complexity by
completing forgoing the temporal nature of the problem. Improving the
efficiency of RL algorithms in real-world problems with sparse or episodic
rewards is therefore a pressing need. In this work, we introduce a
self-imitation learning algorithm that exploits and explores well in the sparse
and episodic reward settings. We view each policy as a state-action visitation
distribution and formulate policy optimization as a divergence minimization
problem. We show that with Jensen-Shannon divergence, this divergence
minimization problem can be reduced into a policy-gradient algorithm with
shaped rewards learned from experience replays. Experimental results indicate
that our algorithm works comparable to existing algorithms in environments with
dense rewards, and significantly better in environments with sparse and
episodic rewards. We then discuss limitations of self-imitation learning, and
propose to solve them by using Stein variational policy gradient descent with
the Jensen-Shannon kernel to learn multiple diverse policies. We demonstrate
its effectiveness on a challenging variant of continuous-control MuJoCo
locomotion tasks.

galactic nuclei are susceptible to the Lidov-Kozai (LK) mechanism, which can
drive orbits to high eccentricities and trigger strong interactions within the
binary such as the emission of gravitational waves (GWs), and mergers of
compact objects. These events are potential sources for GW detectors such as
Advanced LIGO and VIRGO. The LK mechanism is only effective if the binary is
highly inclined with respect to its orbit around the MBH (within a few degrees
of 90 deg), implying low rates. However, close to an MBH, torques from the
stellar cluster give rise to the process of vector resonant relaxation (VRR).
VRR can bring a low-inclination binary into an `active' LK regime in which high
eccentricities and strong interactions are triggered in the binary. Here, we
study the coupled LK-VRR dynamics, with implications for LIGO and VIRGO GW
sources. We carry out Monte Carlo simulations and find that the merger fraction
enhancement due to LK-VRR dynamics is up to a factor of ~10 for the lower end
of assumed MBH masses (M_MBH = 1e4 MSun), and decreases sharply with increasing
M_MBH. We find that, even in our most optimistic scenario, the baseline BH-BH
merger rate is small, and the enhancement by LK-VRR coupling is not large
enough to increase the rate to well above the LIGO/VIRGO lower limit, 12
Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}. For the Galactic Center, the LK-VRR-enhanced rate is ~100
times lower than the LIGO/VIRGO limit, and for M_MBH = 1e4 MSun, the rate
barely reaches 12 Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}.

Given an extended formulation for $ P $, it is easy to obtain an extended
formulation of comparable size for each its radial cones. On the contrary, it
is possible that radial cones of $ P $ admit much smaller extended formulations
than $ P $ itself. A prominent example of this type is the perfect-matching
polytope, which cannot be described by subexponential-size extended

that its radial cones can be described by polynomial-size extended

odd-cut polyhedron, the blocker of the $ V $-join polyhedron. We answer this
question negatively. Precisely, we show that radial cones of odd-cut polyhedra

photolysis in the middle atmosphere of a planet can be limited by an
atmospheric cold-trap, the formation of which largely depends on the amount of
non-condensable gases. We study this effect using a photochemical model coupled
to a 1D radiative-convective equilibrium model in atmospheres with N2, CO2 and
H2O as the main constituents. We find that in atmospheres with a low N2
inventory, water vapor mixing ratios in the middle atmosphere can be over two
orders of magnitude higher compared to atmospheres with an Earth-like N2
inventory. Without a strong surface sink, the non-condensable oxygen can build
up rapidly, drying out the upper atmosphere. With a moderate surface sink, the
planet can approach a steady state with significant oxygen mixing ratios in
which oxygen production is balanced by surface uptake. We use a radiative
transfer model to study the spectroscopic fingerprint of these atmospheres in
transit observations. Spectral signatures of abiotic oxygen and ozone can be of
comparable magnitude as in spectra of Earth seen as an exoplanet. Middle
atmospheric water vapor is unlikely to be a usable indicator of the abiotic
origin of oxygen because of the influence of oxygen on the water vapor
distribution. This suggests that atmospheric oxygen and ozone cannot be used as
binary bioindicators and their interpretation will likely require atmospheric
and planetary models.

recursive interaction between models and apparatus. Models are revised to
account for new evidence produced by apparatus, and apparatus are revised to
better align with the simplifying assumptions of models. Another key feature is
the distinction between the physical phenomenon being investigated and the
measurement equipment used to conduct the investigation. Models of physical

establish a natural order of difficulty in the training set to create the

multiple evaluators to account for differences in emotion perception across
individuals. While some sentences with clear emotional content are consistently
annotated, sentences with more ambiguous emotional content present important
disagreement between individual evaluations. We propose to use the disagreement
between evaluators as a measure of difficulty for the classification task. We
propose metrics that quantify the inter-evaluation agreement to define the
curriculum for regression problems and binary and multi-class classification
problems. The experimental results consistently show that relying on a
curriculum based on agreement between human judgments leads to statistically
significant improvements over baselines trained without a curriculum.

image. We present a method to automatically segment and model pathologies in
medical images, trained solely on data labelled on the image level as either
healthy or containing a visual defect. We base our method on CycleGAN, an
image-to-image translation technique, to translate images between the domains
of healthy and pathological images. We extend the core idea with two key
contributions. Implementing the generators as residual generators allows us to
explicitly model the segmentation of the pathology. Realizing the translation
from the healthy to the pathological domain using a variational autoencoder
allows us to specify one representation of the pathology, as this
transformation is otherwise not unique. Our model hence not only allows us to
create pixelwise semantic segmentations, it is also able to create inpaintings
for the segmentations to render the pathological image healthy. Furthermore, we
can draw new unseen pathology samples from this model based on the distribution
in the data. We show quantitatively, that our method is able to segment
pathologies with a surprising accuracy being only slightly inferior to a
state-of-the-art fully supervised method, although the latter has per-pixel
rather than per-image training information. Moreover, we show qualitative
results of both the segmentations and inpaintings. Our findings motivate
further research into weakly-supervised segmentation using image level
annotations, allowing for faster and cheaper acquisition of training data
without a large sacrifice in segmentation accuracy.

thought to preferentially form beyond the snow line, this naively predicts that
most super-Earths should be very water-rich. Here we show that the
shortest-period planets formed in the migration model are often purely rocky.
The inward migration of icy embryos through the terrestrial zone accelerates
the growth of rocky planets via resonant shepherding. We illustrate this
process with a simulation that provided a match to the Kepler-36 system of two
planets on close orbits with very different densities. In the simulation, two
super-Earths formed in a Kepler-36-like configuration; the inner planet was
pure rock while the outer one was ice-rich. We conclude from a suite of

broad and disconnected from their final orbital radii.

convective regions should generate waves with characteristic periods of ~20
days in core helium burning, ~10 days in helium shell burning, and 0.1 to 1 day

dissipation relatively early in core helium burning throughout most of the
structure. In shell carbon burning, years before explosion, the signal
generated in the helium shell might in some circumstances be weak enough to
avoid shock dissipation, but is subject to strong thermal dissipation in the
hydrogen envelope. Signals from a convective carbon-burning shell are very
likely to be even more severely damped within the envelope. In the most
optimistic case, early in core helium burning, waves arriving close to the

the conditions in the very outer reaches of the envelope suggest severe thermal

utilization. In this paper we explore the implications cloud microservices have
on system bottlenecks, and datacenter server design. We first present and
characterize an end-to-end application built using tens of popular open-source
microservices that implements a movie renting and streaming service, and is
modular and extensible. We then use the end-to-end service to study the
scalability and performance bottlenecks of microservices, and highlight
implications they have on the design of datacenter hardware. Specifically, we
revisit the long-standing debate of brawny versus wimpy cores in the context of
microservices, we quantify the I-cache pressure they introduce, and measure the
time spent in computation versus communication between microservices over RPCs.
As more cloud applications switch to this new programming model, it is
increasingly important to revisit the assumptions we have previously used to

deceptive opinion spam, where fictitious opinions or reviews are deliberately
written to sound authentic. Most of the existing work to detect the deceptive
reviews focus on building supervised classifiers based on syntactic and lexical
patterns of an opinion. With the successful use of Neural Networks on various
classification applications, in this paper, we propose FakeGAN a system that
for the first time augments and adopts Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
for a text classification task, in particular, detecting deceptive reviews.
Unlike standard GAN models which have a single Generator and Discriminator
model, FakeGAN uses two discriminator models and one generative model. The
generator is modeled as a stochastic policy agent in reinforcement learning
(RL), and the discriminators use Monte Carlo search algorithm to estimate and
pass the intermediate action-value as the RL reward to the generator. Providing
the generator model with two discriminator models avoids the mod collapse issue
by learning from both distributions of truthful and deceptive reviews. Indeed,
our experiments show that using two discriminators provides FakeGAN high
stability, which is a known issue for GAN architectures. While FakeGAN is built
upon a semi-supervised classifier, known for less accuracy, our evaluation
results on a dataset of TripAdvisor hotel reviews show the same performance in
terms of accuracy as of the state-of-the-art approaches that apply supervised
machine learning. These results indicate that GANs can be effective for text
classification tasks. Specifically, FakeGAN is effective at detecting deceptive
reviews.

examination, requires substantial manual efforts to acquire standard abdominal
organ views, annotate the views in texts, and record clinically relevant organ

the organs can be instrumental to streamline the examination workflow. However,
this is a challenging problem given not only the inherent difficulties from the
ultrasound modality, e.g., low contrast and large variations, but also the
heterogeneity across tasks, i.e., one classification task for all views, and
then one landmark detection task for each relevant view. While convolutional
neural networks (CNN) have demonstrated more promising outcomes on ultrasound
image analytics than traditional machine learning approaches, it becomes
impractical to deploy multiple networks (one for each task) due to the limited
computational and memory resources on most existing ultrasound scanners. To
overcome such limits, we propose a multi-task learning framework to handle all
the tasks by a single network. This network is integrated to perform view
classification and landmark detection simultaneously; it is also equipped with
global convolutional kernels, coordinate constraints, and a conditional
adversarial module to leverage the performances. In an experimental study based
on 187,219 ultrasound images, with the proposed simplified approach we achieve
(1) view classification accuracy better than the agreement between two clinical
experts and (2) landmark-based measurement errors on par with inter-user

extraction during the training process across all tasks and, as a result,
outperforms the approaches that address each task individually.

cubic in the number of the original examples, which makes it challenging for
DML to handle the large-scale data set. Besides, the real-world data may
contain various uncertainty, especially for the image data. The uncertainty can
mislead the learning procedure and cause the performance degradation. By
investigating the image data, we find that the original data can be observed

selection (TAS) in low-resolution analog-to-digital converter (ADC) systems.
Using low-resolution ADCs is a potential power-reduction solution for multiple
antenna systems. Low-resolution ADC systems with TAS can further reduce cost
and power consumption in wireless transceivers. Considering such systems, we
derive the approximated lower bound of ergodic rate with TAS. Here, we exploit
the approximated distribution of the sum of Weibull random variables to address
the challenge involved in analyzing the quantization error. We, then, derive
the approximated ergodic rate with TAS for a single receive antenna in closed
form, which reveals the TAS gain in low-resolution ADC systems. The upper bound
of a single transmit and single receive antenna system under coarse
quantization is derived to compare with the ergodic rate of the TAS system. The
analysis shows that the TAS method achieves a large improvement in ergodic rate
with a moderate number of transmit antennas. Simulation results validate the
derived ergodic rates and resulting intuition.

codes in $\mathbb{Z}^n$ for $n\geq 3$ and $e\geq 2$. This conjecture remains
open even for linear codes. A recent result of Zhang and Ge establishes the
non-existence of linear $e$-perfect Lee codes in $\mathbb{Z}^n$ for infinitely
many dimensions $n$, for $e=3$ and $4$. In this paper we extend this result in
two ways. First, using the non-existence criterion of Zhang and Ge together
with a generalized version of Lucas' theorem we extend the above result for
almost all $e$ (i.e. a subset of positive integers with density $1$). Namely,
if $e$ contains a digit $1$ in its base-$3$ representation which is not in the
unit place (e.g. $e=3,4$) there are no linear $e$-perfect Lee codes in
$\mathbb{Z}^n$ for infinitely many dimensions $n$. Next, based on a family of
polynomials (the $Q$-polynomials), we present a new criterion for the
non-existence of certain lattice tilings. This criterion depends on a prime $p$
and a tile $B$. For $p=3$ and $B$ being a Lee ball we recover the criterion of
Zhang and Ge.

bipedal robot using the theory of invariant observer design. Aided inertial
navigation is fundamentally a nonlinear observer design problem; thus, current
solutions are based on approximations of the system dynamics, such as an
Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which uses a system's Jacobian linearization
along the current best estimate of its trajectory. On the basis of the theory
of invariant observer design by Barrau and Bonnabel, and in particular, the
Invariant EKF (InEKF), we show that the error dynamics of the point
contact-inertial system follows a log-linear autonomous differential equation;
hence, the observable state variables can be rendered convergent with a domain
of attraction that is independent of the system's trajectory. Due to the
log-linear form of the error dynamics, it is not necessary to perform a
nonlinear observability analysis to show that when using an Inertial
Measurement Unit (IMU) and contact sensors, the absolute position of the robot
and a rotation about the gravity vector (yaw) are unobservable. We further
augment the state of the developed InEKF with IMU biases, as the online
estimation of these parameters has a crucial impact on system performance. We
evaluate the convergence of the proposed system with the commonly used
quaternion-based EKF observer using a Monte-Carlo simulation. In addition, our
experimental evaluation using a Cassie-series bipedal robot shows that the
contact-aided InEKF provides better performance in comparison with the
quaternion-based EKF as a result of exploiting symmetries present in the system
dynamics.

strong brightening with blue shifts up to 170 km s$^{-1}$. At that time only
weak emission was detected in Fe XII and Fe XXI. 2) Subsequently, a weak
looplike brightening started south of the jet, moving outwards with an average

separatingly brightenings, visible only in the Fe XXI line. The southwards
moving component contains red- and blue-shifted emission features and has an
apparent speed of $\sim$120 km s$^{-1}$. The absence of signatures in Fe XII

the emission from very hot plasma, in a blend line in the 195 {\AA} bandpass

the number of ground users covered by UAVs is maximized. In the second
scenario, the minimum number of UAVs needed to provide full coverage for all
ground users is determined. Finally, given the load requirements of the ground

magnetization compensation temperature $T_{\rm M}$ and the angular momentum
compensation temperature $T_{\rm A}$, respectively. Between $T_{\rm M}$ and

neutron-rich fragments emitted in fission, which suggest the formation of
fission fragments in Isobaric Analog states (IAS). We calculate the relative

basic isospin algebra. The calculated results reproduce quite well the

few concerns raised because of the sensitivity of biometric data to outliers,
low performance caused due to intra-class variations and privacy invasion
caused by information leakage. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid
fusion framework where only the protected modalities are combined to fulfill
the requirement of secrecy and performance improvement. This paper presents a
method to integrate cancelable modalities utilizing mean-closure weighting
(MCW) score level and Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory based decision level fusion
for iris and fingerprint to mitigate the limitations in the individual score or
decision fusion mechanisms. The proposed hybrid fusion scheme incorporates the
similarity scores from different matchers corresponding to each protected
modality. The individual scores obtained from different matchers for each
modality are combined using MCW score fusion method. The MCW technique achieves
the optimal weight for each matcher involved in the score computation. Further,
DS theory is applied to the induced scores to output the final decision. The
rigorous experimental evaluations on three virtual databases indicate that the
proposed hybrid fusion framework outperforms over the component level or
individual fusion methods (score level and decision level fusion). As a result,
we achieve (48%,66%), (72%,86%) and (49%,38%) of performance improvement over
unimodal cancelable iris and unimodal cancelable fingerprint verification
systems for Virtual_A, Virtual_B and Virtual_C databases, respectively. Also,
the proposed method is robust enough to the variability of scores and outliers

Gundlach predicted that these perturbations behave like damped or growing

equation of state. We consider a number of different equations of state and
degrees of asphericity and find very good agreement with the findings of
Gundlach for polar $\ell = 2$ modes. For sufficiently soft equations of state,
the modes are damped, meaning that, in the limit of perfect fine-tuning, the
spherically symmetric critical solution is recovered. We find that the degree
of asphericity has at most a small effect on the frequency and damping
parameter, or on the critical exponents in the power-law scalings. Our findings
also confirm, for the first time, Gundlach's prediction that the $\ell = 2$

the spherically symmetric self-similar solution can no longer be recovered by
fine-tuning to the black-hole threshold, and one can no longer expect power-law

account the global features, while neglecting the fine-grained features of
age-sensitive areas. We propose a novel method based on our attention long
short-term memory (AL) network for fine-grained age estimation in the wild,
inspired by the fine-grained categories and the visual attention mechanism.
This method combines the residual networks (ResNets) or the residual network of
residual network (RoR) models with LSTM units to construct AL-ResNets or AL-RoR
networks to extract local features of age-sensitive regions, which effectively
improves the age estimation accuracy. First, a ResNets or a RoR model
pretrained on ImageNet dataset is selected as the basic model, which is then
fine-tuned on the IMDB-WIKI-101 dataset for age estimation. Then, we fine-tune
the ResNets or the RoR on the target age datasets to extract the global
features of face images. To extract the local features of age-sensitive
regions, the LSTM unit is then presented to obtain the coordinates of the
agesensitive region automatically. Finally, the age group classification is
conducted directly on the Adience dataset, and age-regression experiments are
performed by the Deep EXpectation algorithm (DEX) on MORPH Album 2, FG-NET and
15/16LAP datasets. By combining the global and the local features, we obtain
our final prediction results. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness
and robustness of the proposed AL-ResNets or AL-RoR for age estimation in the

temperature 1 MeV into an unmagnetized ambient plasma is examined with a 2D
particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. The pair outflow drives solitary waves in
the ambient protons. Their bipolar electric fields attract electrons of the
outflowing pair cloud and repel positrons. These fields can reflect some of the
protons thereby accelerating them to almost an MeV. Ion acoustic solitary waves
are thus an efficient means to couple energy from the pair cloud to protons.
The scattering of the electrons and positrons by the electric field slows down
their expansion to a nonrelativistic speed. Only a dilute pair outflow reaches
the expansion speed expected from the cloud's thermal speed. Its positrons are
more energetic than its electrons. In time an instability grows at the front of
the dense slow-moving part of the pair cloud, which magnetizes the plasma. The
instability is driven by the interaction of the outflowing positrons with the
protons. These results shed light on how magnetic fields are created and ions
are accelerated in pair-loaded astrophysical jets and winds.

can produce high-order harmonics of the driving light field extending up into

high-harmonic spectroscopy of solids, which provides deeper insights into both
electronic and structural dynamics occuring within a single cycle of light.
Performing high-harmonic generation measurements from silicon and quartz
samples, we demonstrate that the polarization states of high-order harmonics
emitted from solids are not only determined by crystal symmetries, but can be
dynamically controlled, as a consequence of the intertwined interband and
intraband electronic dynamics, responsible for the harmonic generation. We
exploit this symmetry-dynamics duality to efficiently generate circularly
polarized harmonics from elliptically polarized driver pulses. Our experimental
results are supported by ab-initio simulations, providing clear evidence for
the microscopic origin of the phenomenon. This spectroscopy technique might
find important applications in future studies of novel quantum materials such
as strongly correlated materials. Compact sources of bright circularly

to delivering the crucial ingredients for life, NEOs can pose a serious hazard
to humanity since they can impact the Earth. To properly quantify the impact
risk, physical properties of the NEO population need to be studied.
Unfortunately, NEOs have a great variation in terms of mitigation-relevant
quantities (size, albedo, composition, etc.) and less than 15% of them have
been characterized to date. There is an urgent need to undertake a
comprehensive characterization of smaller NEOs (D<300m) given that there are
many more of them than larger objects. One of the main aims of the NEOShield-2
project (2015--2017), financed by the European Community in the framework of
the Horizon 2020 program, is therefore to retrieve physical properties of a
wide number of NEOs in order to design impact mitigation missions and assess
the consequences of an impact on Earth. We carried out visible photometry of
NEOs, making use of the DOLORES instrument at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo

taxonomic classification for each target in our sample. We attributed for the
first time the taxonomical complex of 67 objects obtained during the first year

carbonaceous C-complex NEOs deserve particular attention. These NEOs can be
located in orbits that are challenging from a mitigation point of view, with
high inclination and low minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID). In
addition, the lack of carbonaceous material we see in the small NEO population

avoiding the ""curse of dimensionality"" appearing in large systems. For quantum
dynamics involving multiple electronic states there are several aspects that
need to be addressed. First, the choice of the electronic state representation
is one of most defining in terms of formulation of resulting equations of
motion. We will discuss pros and cons of the standard adiabatic and diabatic
representations as well as the relatively new moving crude adiabatic
representation. Second, if the number of electronic states can be fixed

increases its complexity along the course of the dynamics and a protocol
extending the number of Gaussians is needed. We will consider two common

introduce a general framework based on a view of relations as regions, which
allows us to study the compatibility between ontological knowledge and
different types of vector space embeddings. Our technical contribution is
two-fold. First, we show that some of the most popular existing embedding
methods are not capable of modelling even very simple types of rules, which in
particular also means that they are not able to learn the type of dependencies
captured by such rules. Second, we study a model in which relations are
modelled as convex regions. We show particular that ontologies which are
expressed using so-called quasi-chained existential rules can be exactly
represented using convex regions, such that any set of facts which is induced
using that vector space embedding is logically consistent and deductively
closed with respect to the input ontology.

active particles suspended in a fluid at high concentrations, with particular
attention to lubrication forces which appear when the particles are very close
to one another. We compute exactly the limiting behaviour of the hydrodynamic
interactions between two spherical (circular) active swimmers in very close
proximity to one another in the general setting in both three and (two)
dimensions. Combining this with far-field interactions, we develop a novel
numerical scheme which allows us to study the collective behaviour of large
numbers of active particles with accurate hydrodynamic interactions when close
to one another. We study active swimmers whose intrinsic flow fields are
characterised by force dipoles and quadrupoles. Using this scheme, we are able
to show that lubrication forces when the particles are very close to each other
can play as important a role as long-range hydrodynamic interactions in
determining their many-body behaviour. We find that when the swimmer force
dipole is large, finite clusters and open gel-like clusters appear rather than
complete phase separation. This suppression is due to near-field lubrication
interactions. For swimmers with small force dipoles, we find surprisingly that
a globally polar ordered phase appears because near-field lubrication rather
than long-range hydrodnamics dominate the alignment mechanism. Polar order is
present for very large system sizes and is stable to fluctuations with a finite
noise amplitude. We explain the emergence of polar order using a minimal model
in which only the leading rotational effect of the near-field interaction is
included. These phenomena are also reproduced in two dimensions.

investigate the self-assembly of two ubiquitous methacrylate-based copolymers:
poly(ethylene oxide-b-methylmethacrylate) (PEO-b-PMMA) and poly(ethylene
oxide-b-butylmethacrylate) (PEO-b-PBMA). We derive effective CG potentials that
can reproduce their behaviour in aqueous and organic polymer solutions, pure
copolymer systems, and at the air-water interface following a hybrid
structural-thermodynamic approach, which incorporates macroscopic and
atomistic-level information. The parameterization of the intramolecular CG
potentials results from matching the average probability distributions of
bonded degrees of freedom for chains in solution and in pure polymer systems
with those obtained from atomistic simulations. Potential energy functions for
the description of effective intra- and intermolecular interactions are elected
to be fully compatible with the MARTINI force-field. The optimized models allow
for an accurate prediction of the structural properties of a number of
methacrylate-based copolymers of different length and at different
thermodynamic state points. In addition, we propose a single-segment model for
tetrahydrofuran (THF), an organic solvent commonly used in methacrylate-based
polymer processing. This model exhibits a fluid phase behaviour qualitatively
close to that predicted by more sophisticated molecular models and can
reproduce the experimental free energy of transfer between water and octanol.

solving large-scale problems, especially in machine learning and statistics. At

from one single randomly selected data point. Hence, it scales well with
problem size and is very attractive for truly massive dataset, and holds
significant potentials for solving large-scale inverse problems. In the recent
literature of machine learning, it was empirically observed that when equipped
with early stopping, it has regularizing property. In this work, we rigorously
establish its regularizing property (under \textit{a priori} early stopping
rule), and also prove convergence rates under the canonical sourcewise
condition, for minimizing the quadratic functional for linear inverse problems.
This is achieved by combining tools from classical regularization theory and
stochastic analysis. Further, we analyze the preasymptotic weak and strong

the interior resonance may cause the failure of the corresponding
reconstruction. However, based on the observation that the interior resonant
modes actually carry the geometrical information of the underlying obstacle, we
propose an inverse scattering scheme of using those resonant modes for the
reconstruction. To that end, we first develop a numerical procedure in
determining the interior eigenvalues associated with an unknown obstacle from
its far-field data based on the validity of the factorization method. Then we
propose two efficient optimization methods in further determining the
corresponding eigenfunctions. Using the afore-determined interior resonant
modes, we show that the shape of the underlying obstacle can be effectively
recovered. Moreover, the reconstruction yields enhanced imaging resolution,
especially for the concave part of the obstacle. We provide rigorous
theoretical justifications for the proposed method. Numerical examples in 2D

so-called $B$-modes of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarisation. At
the unprecedented sensitivity level that the new generation of CMB experiments
aims to reach, every uncontrolled instrumental systematic effect will
potentially result in an analysis bias that is larger than the much
sought-after CMB $B$-mode signal. The absolute calibration of the polarisation
angle is particularly important in this sense, as any associated error will end
up in a leakage from the much larger $E$ modes into $B$ modes. The Crab nebula
(Tau A), with its bright microwave synchrotron emission, is one of the few
objects in the sky that can be used as absolute polarisation calibrators. In
this paper we review the best current constraints on its polarisation angle
from 23 to 353 GHz, at typical angular scales for CMB observations, from WMAP,
XPOL, Planck and NIKA data. These polarisation angle measurements are
compatible with a constant angle of $-88.19\,^\circ\pm0.33\,^\circ$. We study
the uncertainty on this mean angle, making different considerations on how to
combine the individual measurement errors. For each of the cases, we study the
potential impact on the CMB $B$-mode spectrum and on the recovered $r$
parameter, through a likelihood analysis. We find that current constraints on
the Crab polarisation angle, assuming it is constant through microwave
frequencies, allow to calibrate experiments with an accuracy enabling the
measurement of $r\sim0.01$. On the other hand, even under the most optimistic
assumptions, current constraints will lead to an important limitation for the
detection of $r\sim10^{-3}$. New realistic measurement of the Crab nebula can
change this situation, by strengthening the assumption of the consistency
across microwave frequencies and reducing the combined error.

Matrix Completion where the predicted rating is modeled as an inner product of
the user and the item features projected onto a latent space. In order to learn
the parameters effectively from a small number of observed ratings, the latent
space is constrained to be low-dimensional which implies that the parameter
matrix is constrained to be low-rank. However, such bilinear modeling of the
ratings can be limiting in practice and non-linear prediction functions can
lead to significant improvements. A natural approach to introducing
non-linearity in the prediction function is to apply a non-linear activation
function on top of the projected user/item features. Imposition of
non-linearities further complicates an already challenging problem that has two
sources of non-convexity: a) low-rank structure of the parameter matrix, and b)
non-linear activation function. We show that one can still solve the non-linear

ReLU can behave significantly differently than say a sigmoid function. Finally,
we apply our proposed technique to recommendation systems and semi-supervised

problem that can illustrate true quantum advantage over classical computers.
Exponential time order is required in order to find the prime factors of an
integer by means of classical computation. However, the order can be
drastically reduced by converting the factorization problem to an optimization
one and solving it using a quantum computer. Recent works involving both
theoretical and experimental approaches use Shor's algorithm, adiabatic quantum
computation and quantum annealing principles to factorize integers. However,
our work makes use of the generalized Grover's algorithm as proposed by Liu,
with an optimal version of classical algorithm/analytic algebra. We utilize the
phase-matching property of the above algorithm for only amplitude amplification
purposes to avoid an inherent phase factor that prevents perfect implementation
of the algorithm. Here we experimentally demonstrate the factorization of two
bi-primes, 4088459 and 966887 using IBM's 5- and 16-qubit quantum processors,
hence making those the largest numbers that have been factorized on a quantum
device. Using the above 5-qubit processor, we also realize the factorization of
a tri-prime integer 175, which had not been achieved to date. We observe good
agreement between experimental and theoretical results with high fidelities.
The difficulty of the factorization experiments has been analyzed and it has
been concluded that the solution to this problem depends on the level of
simplification chosen, not the size of the number factored. In principle, our
results can be extended to factorize any multi-prime integer with minimum
quantum resources.

then allows expression of the entire summation equivalently in terms of a
weighted sum of Riemann zeta functions. It turns out that the solution
fundamentally depends on whether or not $r$ is an integer. If $r$ is a
non-negative integer, then the solution is manifested in a finite series of
weighted Bernoulli numbers, which is then drastically simplified to a second

taking advantage of the relationships between Bernoulli numbers and binomial

  Multi-Task Learning Residual Fully Convolutional Network","Preprint of a paper accepted by IEEE Transactions On Geoscience and
  Remote Sensing",,"10.1109/TGRS.2018.2841808",,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Object detection and semantic segmentation are two main themes in object
retrieval from high-resolution remote sensing images, which have recently
achieved remarkable performance by surfing the wave of deep learning and, more
notably, convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this paper, we are interested
in a novel, more challenging problem of vehicle instance segmentation, which
entails identifying, at a pixel-level, where the vehicles appear as well as
associating each pixel with a physical instance of a vehicle. In contrast,
vehicle detection and semantic segmentation each only concern one of the two.
We propose to tackle this problem with a semantic boundary-aware multi-task
learning network. More specifically, we utilize the philosophy of residual
learning (ResNet) to construct a fully convolutional network that is capable of
harnessing multi-level contextual feature representations learned from
different residual blocks. We theoretically analyze and discuss why residual
networks can produce better probability maps for pixel-wise segmentation tasks.
Then, based on this network architecture, we propose a unified multi-task
learning network that can simultaneously learn two complementary tasks, namely,
segmenting vehicle regions and detecting semantic boundaries. The latter
subproblem is helpful for differentiating closely spaced vehicles, which are
usually not correctly separated into instances. Currently, datasets with
pixel-wise annotation for vehicle extraction are ISPRS dataset and IEEE GRSS
DFC2015 dataset over Zeebrugge, which specializes in semantic segmentation.
Therefore, we built a new, more challenging dataset for vehicle instance
segmentation, called the Busy Parking Lot UAV Video dataset, and we make our
dataset available at http://www.sipeo.bgu.tum.de/download so that it can be
used to benchmark future vehicle instance segmentation algorithms.

photochemistry driven by UV radiation is important for understanding exoplanet

However, in some scenarios, it may be needed to track and serve multiple users

works to our best knowledge. In this paper, considering slow beam steering
where beam directions are assumed to be fixed within a transmission frame, we
find the optimum steering angles to simultaneously serve multiple users within
the frame duration. This is achieved by solving a non-convex optimization
problem using grid based search and majorization-minimization (MM) procedure.
Additionally, we consider multiple steerable beams case with larger number of
users in the network, and propose an algorithm to cluster users and serve each
cluster with a separate beam. The simulation results show that clustering users
can provide higher rates compared to serving each user with a separate beam,
and two user clusters maximizes the sum rate in a crowded room setting.

all profile shapes. We identify a single peaked Mg II profile, in contrast to

framework improves the phase transitions for matrix-decomposition-based
clustering with regard to computational complexity and minimum cluster size,
which are shown to be nearly dimension-free in the low inter-cluster
connectivity regime. A third sampling technique is shown to improve balance by
randomly sampling nodes based on spatial distribution. We provide analysis and
numerical results using a convex clustering algorithm based on matrix
completion.

business intelligence, journalism and many other domains. While a lot of work
focuses on reducing the training cost, inference runtime and storage cost of ML
models, little work studies how to reduce the cost of data acquisition, which
potentially leads to a loss of sellers' revenue and buyers' affordability and

  In this paper, we propose a model-based pricing (MBP) framework, which
instead of pricing the data, directly prices ML model instances. We first
formally describe the desired properties of the MBP framework, with a focus on
avoiding arbitrage. Next, we show a concrete realization of the MBP framework
via a noise injection approach, which provably satisfies the desired formal
properties. Based on the proposed framework, we then provide algorithmic
solutions on how the seller can assign prices to models under different market
scenarios (such as to maximize revenue). Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments, which validate that the MBP framework can provide high revenue to
the seller, high affordability to the buyer, and also operate on low runtime
cost.

consistency model that is more natural for system design. We focus on the
problem of what a designer should do if he/she has an algorithm that works
correctly with sequential consistency but is faced with an underlying key-value
store that provides a weaker (e.g., eventual or causal) consistency. We propose
a detect-rollback based approach: The designer identifies a correctness
predicate, say $P$, and continues to run the protocol, as our system monitors
$P$. If $P$ is violated (because the underlying key-value store provides a
weaker consistency), the system rolls back and resumes the computation at a
state where $P$ holds.
  We evaluate this approach with practical graph applications running on the
Voldemort key-value store. Our experiments with deployment on Amazon AWS EC2
instances shows that using eventual consistency with monitoring can provide a
$50-80\%$ increase in throughput when compared with sequential consistency. We
also show that the overhead of the monitoring itself is low (typically less
than 4\%) and the latency of detecting violations is small. In particular, more
than $99.9\%$ of violations are detected in less than $50$ milliseconds in
regional AWS networks, and in less than $5$ seconds in global AWS networks.

the network size $n$, which is a comparable performance to a centralized

important clues for understanding galaxy evolution. While the properties

their frequency increases going from single galaxies to binary systems to

always been a challenge. It is usually measured by three major factors:
scalability, throughput, and latency. Scalability refers to how the system
capacity is increased by adding more physical resources. Throughput measures
the volume of transactions for a given period of time, where most current
solutions attempt to improve such as NEO, EOS, etc. Latency measures the
processing time of any single transaction. In current blockchain based systems,
the block generation rate is the main latency bottleneck. Off-chain processes
such as state channels are the most recent work that can integrate partial
inbound transactions, reducing latency. Unfortunately, the state channel
introduces more issues at the same time, such as cross-channel synchronization,
which makes the state channel unavailable for full adoption of current
blockchain solutions.
  In order to solve the efficiency problem, we proposed an end-to-end solution
called ALZA, which links the dedicated high-throughput blockchain with
self-organizing payment fields. This mechanism allows arbitrary set of users to
create payment fields that process extremely low latency transactions within
each field. Therefore, users can make transactions almost immediately. Since
all transactions are conducted within fields, transaction costs will be reduced
by several orders of magnitude. In addition, ALZA distributes main ledger to
each client through an innovative replication mechanism. Therefore, the system
will be significantly more robust to blockchain system failures. In theory,
ALZA can complete millions of transactions in one second, which naturally
supports high-frequency trading.

differential sequence is well known for the Minkowski metric and successively
contains the Killing (order 1), the Riemann (order 2) and the Bianchi (order 1
again) operators in the linearized framework, as a particular case of the {\it
Vessiot structure equations}. In all these cases, they discovered that the {\it
compatibility conditions} (CC) for the corresponding Killing operator were
involving {\it a mixture of both second order and third order CC} and their
idea has been to exhibit only a {\it minimal number of generating ones}.
However, even if they exhibited a link between these differential sequences and
the number of parameters of the Lie group preserving the background metric,
they have been unable to provide an intrinsic explanation of this fact, being
limited by the technical use of Weyl spinors, complex Teukolsky scalars or
Killing-Yano tensors. Using the formal theory of systems of partial
differential equations and Lie pseudogroups, the purpose of this difficult
computational paper is to provide new intrinsic differential and homological
methods involving the Spencer operator in order to revisit and solve these
questions, not only in the previous cases but also in the specific case of any
Lie group or Lie pseudogroup of transformations. These new tools are now
available as computer algebra packages.

estimation and attenuation technique is proposed and tested on the nonlinear
kinematic model of the differential drive mobile robot (DDMR). The proposed
technique is an improved version of the Active Disturbance Rejection Control
(ADRC) strategy suggested by J. Han. The ADRC is used to actively reject
disturbances caused by the unknown exogenous signals and the matched
uncertainties of the system model, which are lumped all together and attributed
as a total disturbance. In this work, the considered system is assumed to be
affine and the total disturbance and the input are considered to be on
different channels. To deal with the mismatched disturbances and uncertainties,
the total disturbance has been converted into a matched one. Then, based on the
improved ADRC (IADRC), the dynamic performance of the DDMR has been enhanced by
estimating the total disturbance and canceling it from the system. Through
digital simulations, different performance measures are applied, and they all
indicate the effectiveness of the proposed IADRC by almost removing the
chattering phenomenon and providing a high immunity in the closed-loop system
against torque disturbance.

  of Storage Systems","17 pages",,,,"cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Data storage systems and their availability play a crucial role in
contemporary datacenters. Despite using mechanisms such as automatic fail-over
in datacenters, the role of human agents and consequently their destructive
errors is inevitable. Due to very large number of disk drives used in exascale
datacenters and their high failure rates, the disk subsystem in storage systems
has become a major source of Data Unavailability (DU) and Data Loss (DL)
initiated by human errors. In this paper, we investigate the effect of
Incorrect Disk Replacement Service (IDRS) on the availability and reliability
of data storage systems. To this end, we analyze the consequences of IDRS in a
disk array, and conduct Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate DU and DL during
mission time. The proposed modeling framework can cope with a) different
storage array configurations and b) Data Object Survivability (DOS),
representing the effect of system level redundancies such as remote backups and
mirrors. In the proposed framework, the model parameters are obtained from
industrial and scientific reports alongside field data which have been
extracted from a datacenter operating with 70 storage racks. The results show
that ignoring the impact of IDRS leads to unavailability underestimation by up
to three orders of magnitude. Moreover, our study suggests that by considering
the effect of human errors, the conventional beliefs about the dependability of
different Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) mechanisms should be
revised. The results show that RAID1 can result in lower availability compared
to RAID5 in the presence of human errors. The results also show that employing
automatic fail-over policy (using hot spare disks) can reduce the drastic
impacts of human errors by two orders of magnitude.

the Bunker-East (BKE) Vesuvian station from 1999 to 2014 suggests a higher
nocturnal seismic activity. However, this station is located at about 50 m from
the main road to the volcano's crater and since 2009 its seismograms also
record a significant diurnal cultural noise due mostly to tourist tours to Mt.
Vesuvius. Herein, we investigate whether the different seismic frequency
between day and night times could be an artifact of the peculiar cultural noise
that affects this station mostly from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm from spring to fall.
This time-distributed cultural noise should evidently reduce the possibility to
detect low magnitude earthquakes during those hours but not high magnitude
events. Using hourly distributions referring to different magnitude thresholds
from M = 0.2 to M = 2.0, the Gutenberg-Richter magnitude-frequency diagram
applied to the day and night-time sub-catalogs and Montecarlo statistical
modeling, we demonstrate that the day-night asymmetry persists despite an
evident disruption induced by cultural noise during day-hours. In particular,
for the period 1999-2017, and for earthquakes with M > 2 we found a
Gutenberg-Richter exponent b = 1.66 +/- 0.07 for the night-time events and b =
2.06 +/- 0.07 for day-time events. Moreover, we repeat the analysis also for an
older BKE catalog covering the period from 1992 to 2000 when cultural noise was
not present. The analysis confirms a higher seismic nocturnal activity that is
also characterized by a smaller Gutenberg-Richter exponent b for M > 2
earthquakes relative to the day-time activity. Thus, the found night-day
seismic asymmetric behavior is likely due to a real physical feature affecting
Mt. Vesuvius.

is herein assumed to be mostly the result of the overall circulations occurring
within the ocean-atmospheric system. We find that LOD is negatively correlated
with the global SST and with both the integral function of ZI and NAO, which
are labeled as IZI and INAO. A first result is that LOD must be driven by a
climatic change induced by an external (e.g. solar/astronomical) forcing since
internal variability alone would have likely induced a positive correlation
among the same variables because of the conservation of the Earth's angular
momentum. A second result is that the high correlation among the variables
implies that the LOD and INAO records can be adopted as global proxies to
reconstruct past climate change. Tentative global SST reconstructions since the
17th century suggest that around 1700, that is during the coolest period of the
Little Ice Age (LIA), SST could have been about 1.0-1.5 {\deg}C cooler than the
1950-1980 period. This estimated LIA cooling is greater than what some
multiproxy global climate reconstructions suggested, but it is in good
agreement with other more recent climate reconstructions including those based
on borehole temperature data.
