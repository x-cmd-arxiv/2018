of the degrees of freedom of a quantum system. We consider a scenario where our
direct access is restricted to a small subsystem $S$ that is constantly
interacting with the rest of the system $E$. What we investigate here is the
fundamental structure of the Hilbert space that is caused solely by the
restrictedness of the direct control. We clarify the intrinsic space structure
of the entire system and that of the operations which could be activated
through $S$. The structures hereby revealed would help us make quantum control
problems more transparent and provide a guide for understanding what we can
implement. They can be deduced by considering an algebraic structure, which is
the Jordan algebra formed from Hermitian operators, naturally induced by the
setting of limited access. From a few very simple assumptions about direct
operations, we elucidate rich structures of the operator algebras and Hilbert
spaces that manifest themselves in quantum control scenarios.

mounted on ground/aerial vehicles for smart-city surveillance or environment
monitoring. To support the high-mobility sensing with low network latency, a
technique called over-the-air-computation (AirComp) was recently developed
which enables an access-point to receive a desired function of sensing-data
from concurrent-transmissions by exploiting the superposition property of a
multi-access-channel. This work aims at further developing AirComp for
next-generation multi-antenna multi-modal sensor networks. Specifically, we
design beamforming and channel-feedback techniques for multi-function AirComp.
Given the objective of minimizing sum-mean-squared-error of computed functions,
the optimization of receive-beamforming for multi-function AirComp is a NP-hard
problem. The approximate problem based on tightening transmission-power
constraints, however, is shown to be solvable using differential-geometry. The
solution is proved to be the weighted-centroid of points on a
Grassmann-manifold, where each point represents the subspace spanned by the
channel matrix of a sensor. As a by-product, the beamforming problem is found
to have the same form as the classic problem of multicast-beamforming,
establishing the AirComp-multicasting-duality. Its significance lies in making
the said Grassmannian-centroid solution transferable to the latter problem
which otherwise is solved using the computation-intensive
semidefinite-relaxation-technique. Last, building on the AirComp-beamforming
solution, an efficient channel-feedback technique is designed for an
access-point to receive the beamformer from distributed sensor transmissions of
designed signals that are functions of local channel-state-information.

the HT, to obtain quadrature component of a signal, we propose the novel
discrete Fourier cosine quadrature transforms (FCQTs) and discrete Fourier sine
quadrature transforms (FSQTs), designated as Fourier quadrature transforms
(FQTs). Using these FQTs, we propose sixteen Fourier-Singh analytic signal
(FSAS) representations with following properties: (1) real part of eight FSAS
representations is the original signal and imaginary part is the FCQT of the
real part, (2) imaginary part of eight FSAS representations is the original
signal and real part is the FSQT of the real part, (3) like the GAS, Fourier
spectrum of the all FSAS representations has only positive frequencies, however
unlike the GAS, the real and imaginary parts of the proposed FSAS
representations are not orthogonal to each other. The Fourier decomposition
method (FDM) is an adaptive data analysis approach to decompose a signal into a
set of small number of Fourier intrinsic band functions which are AM-FM
components. This study also proposes a new formulation of the FDM using the
discrete cosine transform (DCT) with the GAS and FSAS representations, and
demonstrate its efficacy for improved time-frequency-energy representation and

of the main open problems in descriptive complexity theory and database theory.
In 2010 Grohe showed that fixed point logic with counting captures polynomial
time on all classes of graphs with excluded minors. We now consider classes of
graphs with excluded induced subgraphs. For such graph classes, an effective
graph decomposition, called modular decomposition, was introduced by Gallai in
1976. The graphs that are non-decomposable with respect to modular
decomposition are called prime. We present a tool, the Modular Decomposition
Theorem, that reduces (definable) canonization of a graph class C to
(definable) canonization of the class of prime graphs of C that are colored
with binary relations on a linearly ordered set. By an application of the
Modular Decomposition Theorem, we show that fixed point logic with counting
captures polynomial time on the class of permutation graphs. Within the proof
of the Modular Decomposition Theorem, we show that the modular decomposition of
a graph is definable in symmetric transitive closure logic with counting. We
obtain that the modular decomposition tree is computable in logarithmic space.
It follows that cograph recognition and cograph canonization is computable in
logarithmic space.

weighted graphs endowed with probability measures on their nodes. We suppose
that the edge weights are distances between the nodes and that the probability
measure on the nodes is related to events observed there. For instance, a graph
can represent a subway network: its edge weights are the distance between two
stations, and the observed events at each node are the subway users getting in
or leaving the subway network at this station. The probability measure on the
nodes does not need to be explicitly known. Our strategy only uses observed
node related events to give more or less emphasis to the different nodes.
Furthermore, the barycenter estimation can be updated in real time with each
new event.
  We propose a multiscale extension of \cite{arXiv:1605.04148} where the
decribed strategy is valid only for medium-sized graphs due to memory costs.
Our multiscale approach is inspired from the geometrical decomposition of the
barycenter in a Euclidean space: we apply a heuristic \textit{divide et impera}
strategy based on a preliminary clustering. Our strategy is finally assessed on
road- and social-networks of up to $10^6$ nodes. We show that its results
compare well with \cite{arXiv:1605.04148} in terms of accuracy and stability on
small graphs, and that it can additionally be used on large graphs even on

measured in CN and HCN, indicates that a fractionated reservoir of nitrogen is
available at the stage of comet formation. This reservoir presents a 3:1
enrichment in 15N relative to the elemental ratio of 330, identical to that
between comets and the sun, suggesting that similar processes are responsible
for the fractionation in the protosolar nebula (PSN) and in PSN analogs.
However, how the fractionation of nitrogen takes place is an open question.
Previously obtained HCN/HC15N abundance ratios suggest that HCN may be enriched
in 15N in prestellar cores, although doubts remain on these measurements, which
rely on the double-isotopologue method. Here we present direct measurements of
the HCN/H13CN and HCN/HC15N abundance ratios in the L1498 prestellar core based
on spatially resolved spectra of HCN(1-0), (3-2), H13CN(1-0), and HC15N(1-0).
We use state-of-the-art radiative transfer calculations using ALICO, a 1D
radiative transfer code capable of treating hyperfine (hf) overlaps. From an
analysis of dust emission maps of L1498, we derive a new physical structure. We
also use new, high-accuracy HCN-H2 hf collisional rates, which enable us to
quantitatively reproduce all the features of the HCN(1-0) and HCN(3-2) spectra,
especially the anomalous hf line ratios. Special attention is devoted to derive
meaningful uncertainties on the abundance ratios. The obtained values,
HCN/H13CN=45(3) and HCN/HC15N=338(28), indicate that carbon is fractionated in
HCN, but nitrogen is not. For the HCN/HC15N abundance ratio, our study
validates to some extent analyses based on the single excitation temperature
assumption. Comparisons with other measurements suggest significant
core-to-core variability. Furthermore, the 13C enrichment we found in HCN could
explain the superfractionation of nitrogen measured in solar system chondrites.

is based on the functorial properties of the intersection product, and relies
on some constructions due to Connes-Skandalis and to Hilsum-Skandalis.

application due to limited resources and power. Hence, developing
energy-efficient solutions to address this issue will require innovation in
algorithmic design, software and hardware. Such innovation requires
benchmarking and characterization of Deep Neural Networks based on performance
and energy-consumption alongside accuracy. However, current benchmarks studies
in existing deep learning frameworks (for example, Caffe, Tensorflow, Torch and
others) are based on performance of these applications on high-end CPUs and
GPUs. In this work, we introduce a benchmarking framework called ""SyNERGY"" to
measure the energy and time of 11 representative Deep Convolutional Neural
Networks on embedded platforms such as NVidia Jetson TX1. We integrate ARM's
Streamline Performance Analyser with standard deep learning frameworks such as
Caffe and CuDNNv5, to study the execution behaviour of current deep learning
models at a fine-grained level (or specific layers) on image processing tasks.
In addition, we build an initial multi-variable linear regression model to
predict energy consumption of unseen neural network models based on the number
of SIMD instructions executed and main memory accesses of the CPU cores of the
TX1 with an average relative test error rate of 8.04 +/- 5.96 %. Surprisingly,
we find that it is possible to refine the model to predict the number of SIMD
instructions and main memory accesses solely from the application's
Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) counts, hence, eliminating the need for actual
measurements. Our predicted results demonstrate 7.08 +/- 6.0 % average relative
error over actual energy measurements of all 11 networks tested, except

classifier to assess the relevance of each property. Correlations between
galaxy properties and their cosmic environment can be used to predict galaxy
membership to void/wall or filament/cluster with an accuracy of $93\%$. Our
study unveils environmental information encoded in properties of haloes not
normally considered directly dependent on the cosmic environment such as merger
history and complexity. Understanding the physical mechanism by which the
cosmic web is imprinted in a halo can lead to significant improvements in
galaxy formation models. This is accomplished by extracting features from
galaxy properties and merger trees, computing feature scores for each feature
and then applying support vector machine to different feature sets. To this
end, we have discovered that the shape and depth of the merger tree, formation
time and density of the galaxy are strongly associated with the cosmic
environment. We describe a significant improvement in the original
classification algorithm by performing LU decomposition of the distance matrix
computed by the feature vectors and then using the output of the decomposition

progression from 'stamp-collecting' to demography, from discovery to
characterisation, from exoplanets to comparative exoplanetology. There is an
exhilaration when a prediction is confirmed, a trend is observed, or a new
population appears. This transition has been driven by the rise in the sheer
number of known exoplanets, which has been rising exponentially for two decades
(Mamajek 2016). However, the careful collection, scrutiny and organisation of
these exoplanets is necessary for drawing robust, scientific conclusions that
are sensitive to the biases and caveats that have gone into their discovery.
The purpose of this chapter is to discuss and demonstrate important
considerations to keep in mind when examining or constructing a catalogue of
exoplanets. First, we introduce the value of exoplanetary catalogues. There are
a handful of large, online databases that aggregate the available exoplanet
literature and render it digestible and navigable - an ever more complex task
with the growing number and diversity of exoplanet discoveries. We compare and
contrast three of the most up-to-date general catalogues, including the data
and tools that are available. We then describe exoplanet catalogues that were
constructed to address specific science questions or exoplanet discovery space.
Although we do not attempt to list or summarise all the published lists of
exoplanets in the literature in this chapter, we explore the case study of the
NASA Kepler mission planet catalogues in some detail. Finally, we lay out some
of the best practices to adopt when constructing or utilising an exoplanet
catalogue.

reduce the high variance of noisy stochastic gradients, Dubey et al. [2016]
applied the standard variance reduction technique on stochastic gradient
Langevin dynamics and obtained both theoretical and experimental improvements.
In this paper, we apply the variance reduction tricks on Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo and achieve better theoretical convergence results compared with the
variance-reduced Langevin dynamics. Moreover, we apply the symmetric splitting
scheme in our variance-reduced Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithms to further
improve the theoretical results. The experimental results are also consistent
with the theoretical results. As our experiment shows, variance-reduced
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo demonstrates better performance than variance-reduced
Langevin dynamics in Bayesian regression and classification tasks on real-world

compensates the negative contribution from the native population, because of

However, model uncertainty, in particular regarding the fundamental diagram and

(+H_3)$, with the couplings probed up to $\sim 10^{-4}$ for a wide range of
neutral scalar mass, which is well beyond the reach of current searches for
charged lepton flavor violation. The Yukawa couplings of the doubly-charged
scalar $H^{\pm\pm}$ to the charged leptons might also be flavor-violating,
which is correlated to the heavy right-handed neutrino masses and mixings. With
a combination of the pair, single and off-shell production of $H^{\pm\pm}$ like
$e^+e^- \to H^{++} H^{--},\, H^{\pm\pm} e^\mp \mu^\mp,\, \mu^\pm \tau^\mp$, the
Yukawa couplings can be probed up to $10^{-3}$ at future lepton colliders,
which is allowed by current lepton flavor data in a large region of parameter
space. For both the neutral and doubly-charged cases, the scalar masses could
be probed up to the few-TeV range in the off-shell channel.

low-redshift probes has been found to be generally lower than the value derived
from CMB observations in the $\Lambda$CDM model. This tension has been
exemplified by Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and X-ray cluster counts which, when using
their Planck standard cluster mass calibration, yield a value of $\sigma_8$ ,
appreciably lower than estimations based on the latest Planck CMB measurements.
In this work we examine whether non-minimal neutrino masses can alleviate this
tension substantially. We used the cluster X-ray temperature distribution
function derived from a flux-limited sample of local X-ray clusters, combined
with Planck CMB measurements. These datasets were compared to $\Lambda$CDM
predictions based on recent mass function, adapted to account for the effects
of massive neutrinos. Treating the clusters mass calibration as a free
parameter, we examined whether the data favours neutrino masses appreciably
higher than the minimal 0.06 eV value. Using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods,
we found no significant correlation between the mass calibration of clusters
and the sum of neutrino masses, meaning that massive neutrinos do not
noticeably alleviate the above-mentioned Planck CMB--clusters tension. The
addition of other datasets (BAO and Ly-$\alpha$) reinforces those conclusions.
As an alternative possible solution to the tension, we introduced a simple,
phenomenological modification of gravity by letting the growth index $\gamma$
vary as an additional free parameter. We find that the cluster mass calibration
is robustly correlated with the $\gamma$ parameter, insensitively to the
presence of massive neutrinos or/and additional data used. We conclude that the
standard Planck mass calibration of clusters, if consolidated, would represent
evidence for new physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM with massive neutrinos.

evaporation started nearly simultaneously in all the three hot channels of AIA
such as 131~{\AA}, 94~{\AA} and 335~{\AA}, which was observed to be temperature

became fully brightened following the ARTBs after $\approx25$~s in 131~{\AA},
$\approx 40$~s in 94~{\AA}, and $\approx 6.5$~min in 335~{\AA}. The DEM
measurements at the two footpoints (i.e., of two ARTBs) and the loop-top

these locations. The spectroscopic observations from IRIS revealed the presence
of redshifted emission of $\sim$20~km~s$^{-1}$ in cooler lines like \ion{C}{2}

at the footpoint of the loop. During the ARTBs, the line width of \ion{C}{2}

Moreover, enhancement in the line width preceded that in the Doppler shift

qualitatively reproduced by 1-D hydrodynamic simulations where energy was
deposited at both the footpoints of a monolithic coronal loop that mimicked the

make use of skyrmions. Several public domain micromagnetic simulation packages

DMI terms. It is therefore highly desirable to propose a so-called
micromagnetic standard problem that would allow one to benchmark and test the
different software packages in a similar way as is done for ferromagnetic
materials without DMI. Here, we provide a sequence of well-defined and
increasingly complex computational problems for magnetic materials with DMI.
Our test problems include 1D, 2D and 3D domains, spin wave dynamics in the
presence of DMI, and validation of the analytical and numerical solutions
including uniform magnetisation, edge tilting, spin waves and skyrmion
formation. This set of problems can be used by developers and users of new

significant empirically motivated and theoretically founded progress to improve

particularly those hosting super-Eddington SMBHs ($\lambda_{\rm Edd} > 1$: the
key phase of SMBH growth). Here, we compiled reported optical and
$^{12}$CO(1--0) data of local quasars to characterize their hosts. We found
that higher $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ SMBHs tend to reside in gas rich (i.e., high
gas mass to stellar mass fraction = $f_{\rm gas}$) galaxies. We used two
methods to make this conclusion: one uses black hole mass as a surrogate for
stellar mass by assuming a local co-evolutionary relationship, and the other
directly uses stellar masses estimated from near-infrared observations. The
$f_{\rm gas}$--$\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ correlation we found concurs with the cosmic
decreasing trend in $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$, as cold molecular gas is primarily
consumed by star formation. This correlation qualitatively matches predictions
of recent semi-analytic models about the cosmic downsizing of SMBHs as well. As
the gas mass surface density would eventually be a key parameter controlling
mass accretion, we need high-resolution observations to identify further
differences in the molecular properties around super-Eddington and

has been recently discovered that in the Higgs branch of $5d$ and $6d$ SQCD
theories with eight supercharges, the new massless states, arising when the
gauge coupling is taken to infinity, can be described in terms of Coulomb
branches of $3d ~\mathcal N=4$ quiver gauge theories. The description of this
new phenomenon draws from the ideas discovered in the analysis of nilpotent
orbits as Higgs and Coulomb branches of $3d$ theories and promotes the Higgs
mechanism known as the Kraft-Procesi transition to the status of a new
operation between quivers. This is the quiver subtraction. This paper
establishes this operation formally and examines some immediate consequences.
One is the extension of the physical realization of Kraft-Procesi transitions
from the classical to the exceptional Lie algebras. Another result is the
extension from special nilpotent orbits to non-special ones. One further
consequence is the analysis of the effect in $5d ~\mathcal N=1$ SQCD of
integrating out a massive quark while the gauge coupling remains infinite. In
general, the subtraction of quivers sheds light on the different types of
singularities within the Coulomb branch and the structure of the massless
states that arise at those singular points; including the nature of the new
Higgs branches that open up. This allows for a systematic analysis of mixed
branches of $3d ~\mathcal N=4$ quivers that do not necessarily have a simple
embedding in string theory. The subtraction of two quivers is an extremely
simple resource for the theoretical physicist interested in the vacuum
structure of gauge theories, and yet its power is so remarkable that is bound
to play a crucial role in the coming discoveries of new and exciting physics in

particle physics necessitates light higgsinos not too far from the weak scale
characterized by m(weak)~ m(W,Z,h)~100 GeV. On the other hand, LHC Higgs mass
measurements and sparticle mass limits point to a SUSY breaking scale in the
multi-TeV regime. Under such conditions, the lightest SUSY particle is expected
to be a mainly higgsino-like neutralino with non-negligible gaugino components
(required by naturalness). The computed thermal WIMP abundance in natural SUSY
models is then found to be typically a factor 5-20 below its measured value. To
gain concordance with observations, either an additional DM particle (the axion
is a well-motivated possibility) must be present or additional non-thermal
mechanisms must augment the neutralino abundance. We compare present direct and
indirect WIMP detection limits to three natural SUSY models based on gravity-,
anomaly- and mirage-mediation. We show that the case of natural higgsino-only
dark matter where non-thermal production mechanisms augment its relic density,
is essentially excluded by a combination of direct detection constraints from
PandaX-II, LUX and Xenon-1t experiments, and by bounds from Fermi-LAT/MAGIC
observations of gamma rays from dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

crash-prone, message-passing systems is an important problem in distributed
computing. Communication latency is a factor that typically dominates the
performance of message-passing systems, consequently the efficiency of
algorithms implementing atomic objects is measured in terms of the number of
communication exchanges involved in each read and write operation. The seminal
result of Attiya, Bar-Noy, and Dolev established that two pairs of
communication exchanges, or equivalently two round-trip communications, are
sufficient. Subsequent research examined the possibility of implementations
that involve less than four exchanges. The work of Dutta et al. showed that for
single-writer/multiple-reader (SWMR) settings two exchanges are sufficient,
provided that the number of readers is severely constrained with respect to the
number of object replicas in the system and the number of replica failures, and
also showed that no two exchange implementations of
multiple-writer/multiple-reader (MWMR) objects are possible. Later research
focused on providing implementations that remove the constraint on the number
of readers, while having read and write operations that use variable number of
communication exchanges, specifically two, three, or four exchanges.
  This work presents two advances in the state-of-the-art in this area.
Specifically, for SWMR and MWMR systems algorithms are given in which read
operations take two or three exchanges. This improves on prior works where read
operations took either (a) three exchanges, or (b) two or four exchanges. The
number of readers in the new algorithms is unconstrained, and write operations
take the same number of exchanges as in prior work (two for SWMR and four for
MWMR settings). The correctness of algorithms is rigorously argued.

formation of multiple interacting plasmoids, and previous studies have shown
that plasmoid dynamics can trigger MHD waves of different modes propagating
outward from the reconnection site. However, variations in plasma parameters
and magnetic field strength in the vicinity of a coronal reconnection site may
lead to wave reflection and mode conversion. In this paper we investigate the
reflection and refraction of fast magnetoacoustic waves near a reconnection
site. Under a justified assumption of an analytically specified Alfv\'{e}n
speed profile, we derive and solve analytically the full wave equation
governing propagation of fast mode waves in a non-uniform background plasma
without recourse to the small-wavelength approximation. We show that the waves
undergo reflection near the reconnection current sheet due to the Alfv\'en
speed gradient and that the reflection efficiently depends on the
plasma-$\beta$ parameter as well as on the wave frequency. In particular, we
find that waves are reflected more efficiently near reconnection sites in a
low-$\beta$ plasma which is typical for the solar coronal conditions. Also, the
reflection is larger for lower frequency waves while high frequency waves
propagate outward from the reconnection region almost without the reflection.
We discuss the implications of efficient wave reflection near magnetic
reconnection sites in strongly magnetized coronal plasma for particle
acceleration, and also the effect this might have on First Ionization Potential
(FIP) fractionation by the ponderomotive force of these waves in the
chromosphere.

quantum Hall effect. We consider an interacting version of the model, and prove
that for short-range interactions, smaller than the bandwidth, the Hall
conductivity is quantized, for all the values of the parameters outside two
critical curves, across which the model undergoes a `topological' phase
transition: the Hall coefficient remains integer and constant as long as we
continuously deform the parameters without crossing the curves; when this
happens, the Hall coefficient jumps abruptly to a different integer. Previous
works were limited to the perturbative regime, in which the interaction is much
smaller than the bare gap, so they were restricted to regions far from the
critical lines. The non-renormalization of the Hall conductivity arises as a
consequence of lattice conservation laws and of the regularity properties of
the current-current correlations. Our method provides a full construction of
the critical curves, which are modified (`dressed') by the electron-electron

infrared divergences in the naive perturbative series, which we resolve via
renormalization group methods.

perform person segmentation and identification jointly. We find that solving

fine-grained segmentation allows us to better perform matching across views,

universality class as the deconfined quantum critical point in spin-1/2
antiferromagnets but with very different microscopic physics and microscopic
symmetries. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that this transition has an
emergent SO(5) symmetry relating quantities characterizing the two adjacent
phases. While the low-temperature phase has a conventional order parameter, the
defining property of the Coulomb liquid on the high-temperature side is
deconfinement of monomers, and so the SO(5) symmetry relates fundamentally
different types of objects. We study linear system sizes up to $L=96$, and find
that this symmetry applies with an excellent precision that consistently
improves with system size over this range. It is remarkable that SO(5) emerges
in a system as basic as the cubic dimer model, with only simple discrete
degrees of freedom. Our results are important evidence for the generality of
the SO(5) symmetry that has been proposed for the NCCP$^1$ field theory. We
describe a possible interpretation for these results in terms of a consistent

possibility that SO(5) may ultimately be a near-symmetry rather than an exact

gas pressure and the CN excitation should help to distinguish between these two
possibilities. 3 of the 4 active galactic nuclei in our sample show CO/CN line
ratios that are roughly a factor of 2-3 larger than those seen in
starburst-dominated regions, which may be in conflict with models of molecular
abundances in X-ray dominated regions.

need not exist in the traditional sense. However, the MLE may exist in the

in the completion solve many linear programs; they are slow in small problems
and too slow for large problems. We provide new, fast, and scalable methodology
for finding the MLE in the completion of the exponential family. This
methodology is based on conventional maximum likelihood computations which come
close, in a sense, to finding the MLE in the completion of the exponential
family. These conventional computations construct a likelihood maximizing
sequence of canonical parameter values which goes uphill on the likelihood
function until they meet a convergence criteria. Nonexistence of the MLE in
this context results from a degeneracy of the canonical statistic of the
exponential family, the canonical statistic is on the boundary of its support.
There is a correspondance between this boundary and the null eigenvectors of
the Fisher information matrix. Convergence of Fisher information along a
likelihood maximizing sequence follows from cumulant generating function (CGF)
convergence along a likelihood maximizing sequence, conditions for which are
given. This allows for the construction of necessarily one-sided confidence
intervals for mean value parameters when the MLE exists in the completion. We
demonstrate our methodology on three examples in the main text and three
additional examples in the Appendix. We show that when the MLE exists in the

inference that is much faster than existing techniques.

referred to as {\em prefix-free parsing}, that takes a text $T$ as input, and
in one-pass generates a dictionary $D$ and a parse $P$ of $T$ with the property
that the BWT of $T$ can be constructed from $D$ and $P$ using workspace
proportional to their total size and $O (|T|)$-time. Our experiments show that
$D$ and $P$ are significantly smaller than $T$ in practice, and thus, can fit
in a reasonable internal memory even when $T$ is very large. In particular, we
show that with prefix-free parsing we can build an 131-megabyte run-length

a renewed interest due to the way it can revolutionise internal logistics,
especially in unstructured environments. This paper presents a novel
architecture allowing a robot to detect, localise, and track (possibly
multiple) pallets using machine learning techniques based on an on-board 2D
laser rangefinder only. The architecture is composed of two main components:
the first stage is a pallet detector employing a Faster Region-based
Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) detector cascaded with a CNN-based
classifier; the second stage is a Kalman filter for localising and tracking
detected pallets, which we also use to defer commitment to a pallet detected in
the first stage until sufficient confidence has been acquired via a sequential
data acquisition process. For fine-tuning the CNNs, the architecture has been
systematically evaluated using a real-world dataset containing 340 labeled 2D
scans, which have been made freely available in an online repository. Detection
performance has been assessed on the basis of the average accuracy over k-fold
cross-validation, and it scored 99.58% in our tests. Concerning pallet
localisation and tracking, experiments have been performed in a scenario where
the robot is approaching the pallet to fork. Although data have been originally
acquired by considering only one pallet as per specification of the use case we
consider, artificial data have been generated as well to mimic the presence of
multiple pallets in the robot workspace. Our experimental results confirm that
the system is capable of identifying, localising and tracking pallets with a
high success rate while being robust to false positives.

algorithms such as logistic regression (GLM) and semi-parametric ones like

with the aim to receive bias-reduced performance estimates. As a case study the
spatial distribution of forest disease Diplodia sapinea in the Basque Country
in Spain is investigated using common environmental variables such as
temperature, precipitation, soil or lithology as predictors. Results show that
GAM and RF (mean AUROC estimates 0.708 and 0.699) outperform all other methods
in predictive accuracy. The effect of hyperparameter tuning saturates at around
50 iterations for this data set. The AUROC differences between the bias-reduced

performance estimates of the GAM and RF are 0.167 (24%) and 0.213 (30%),

Typical fluctuations are described by a universal function which depends solely
on general properties of the external potential. The rate function controlling
large deviations is, rather unexpectedly, not strictly convex and has a
discontinuous third derivative around its minimum for both extremal and bulk
particles. This implies, in turn, that the rate function cannot predict the
anomalous scaling of the typical fluctuations with the system size. Moreover,
its asymptotic behavior for extremal particles differs from the predictions of
the Tracy-Widom distribution. Thus many of the paradigmatic properties of the
full particle statistics of two-dimensional systems do \emph{not} carry out
into their one-dimensional counterparts, hence proving that 1d CG belongs to a
different universality class. Our analytical expressions are thoroughly

information $I$. The classical mutual information in the data $I_c\le I/2=C$,
with $C$ maximal classical correlations obtained by choosing a suitable

hand-tool interaction under image guidance depend on a specific type of visual
and spatial sensorimotor learning. Novices have to learn to optimally control
what their hands are doing in a real-world environment while looking at an
image representation of the scene on a video monitor. Previous research has
shown slower task execution times and lower performance scores under
image-guidance compared with situations of direct action viewing. The cognitive
processes for overcoming this drawback by training are not yet understood.
Methods: We investigated the effects of training on the time and precision of
direct view versus image guided object positioning on targets of a Real-world
Action Field (RAF). Two men and two women had to learn to perform the task as
swiftly and as precisely as possible with their dominant hand, using a tool or
not and wearing a glove or not. Individuals were trained in sessions of mixed
trial blocks with no feed-back. Results: As predicted, image-guidance produced
significantly slower times and lesser precision in all trainees and
sessionscompared with direct viewing. With training, all trainees get faster in
all conditions, but only one of them gets reliably more precise in the
image-guided conditions. Speed-accuracy trade-offs in the individual
performance data show that the highest precision scores and steepest learning
curve, for time and precision, were produced by the slowest
starter.Conclusions: Performance evolution towards optimal precision is
compromised when novices start by going as fast as they can. The findings have
direct implications for individual skill monitoring in training programmes for
image-guided technology applications with human operators.

an emergence of multi-body effects in few-body systems of sites populated with

behaviors from psychology studies. In addition, POMDP provides a general
modeling framework for sequential decision making where states are hidden and
actions have stochastic outcomes. Distinct from the majority of POMDP model
learning literature, we do not assume that the state, the transition structure
or the bound of the number of states in POMDP model is given. Instead, we use a
Bayesian non-parametric learning approach to decide the potential human states
from data. Then we adopt an approach inspired by probably approximately correct
(PAC) learning to obtain not only an estimation of the transition probability
but also a confidence interval associated to the estimation. Then, the
performance of applying the control policy derived from the estimated model is
guaranteed to be sufficiently close to the true model. Finally, data collected
from a driver-assistance test-bed are used to train the model, which
illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed learning method.

  Designing and Recurrent Neural Contextual Learning",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automatic pancreas segmentation in radiology images, eg., computed tomography
(CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is frequently required by
computer-aided screening, diagnosis, and quantitative assessment. Yet pancreas
is a challenging abdominal organ to segment due to the high inter-patient
anatomical variability in both shape and volume metrics. Recently,
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated promising performance on
accurate segmentation of pancreas. However, the CNN-based method often suffers
from segmentation discontinuity for reasons such as noisy image quality and
blurry pancreatic boundary. From this point, we propose to introduce recurrent
neural networks (RNNs) to address the problem of spatial non-smoothness of
inter-slice pancreas segmentation across adjacent image slices. To inference
initial segmentation, we first train a 2D CNN sub-network, where we modify its
network architecture with deep-supervision and multi-scale feature map
aggregation so that it can be trained from scratch with small-sized training
data and presents superior performance than transferred models. Thereafter, the
successive CNN outputs are processed by another RNN sub-network, which refines
the consistency of segmented shapes. More specifically, the RNN sub-network
consists convolutional long short-term memory (CLSTM) units in both top-down
and bottom-up directions, which regularizes the segmentation of an image by
integrating predictions of its neighboring slices. We train the stacked CNN-RNN
model end-to-end and perform quantitative evaluations on both CT and MRI
images.

a catastrophic transition. Axisymmetric static solutions for a relativistic

magnetic-field irregularity at a small scale. Locally twisted models are
constructed by limiting current flow regions, where the small part originates

increases and becomes sufficient to open the magnetic field in some models. In
energetically metastable states, a magnetic flux rope is formed in the vicinity

Second, we recall a proof from the literature, which lends itself to a linear

high-speed data. Such data processing needs can be modeled as a streaming
computation. A streaming computation is specified as a dataflow graph that
exposes multiple opportunities for parallelizing its execution, in the form of
data, pipeline and task parallelism. On the other hand, many important
applications require that processing of the stream be ordered, where inputs are
processed in the same order as they arrive. There is a fundamental conflict
between ordered processing and parallelizing the streaming computation. This
paper focuses on the problem of effectively parallelizing ordered streaming
computations on a shared-memory multicore machine.
  We first address the key challenges in exploiting data parallelism in the
ordered setting. We present a low-latency, non-blocking concurrent data
structure to order outputs produced by concurrent workers on an operator. We
also propose a new approach to parallelizing partitioned stateful operators
that can handle load imbalance across partitions effectively and mostly avoid
delays due to ordering. We illustrate the trade-offs and effectiveness of our
concurrent data-structures on micro-benchmarks and streaming queries from the
TPCx-BB benchmark. We then present an adaptive runtime that dynamically maps
the exposed parallelism in the computation to that of the machine. We propose
several intuitive scheduling heuristics and compare them empirically on the
TPCx-BB queries. We find that for streaming computations, heuristics that
exploit as much pipeline parallelism as possible perform better than those that
seek to exploit data parallelism.

resulting in fewer low-energy excitations in the charge channel. In the spin

hourglass behavior in hole doping, while in electron doping we find clearly
spin-wave-like dispersions starting from q=(pi,pi). Along the (0,0)-(pi,0)

expected to increase as the detectors approach their design sensitivity.
Gravitational wave detectors are also sensitive to transient noise sources
created by the environment and the detector, known as `glitches'. As the rate
of astrophysical sources increases, the probability that a signal will occur at
the same time as a glitch also increases. This has occurred previously in the
gravitational wave binary neutron star detection GW170817. In the case of
GW170817, the glitch in the Livingston detector was easy to identify, and much
shorter than the total duration of the signal, making it possible for the
glitch to be removed. In this paper, we examine the effect of glitches on the
measurement of signal parameters and Bayes factors used for model selection for
much more difficult cases, where it may not be possible to determine that the
glitch is present or to remove it. We include binary black holes similar to
current detections, sine Gaussian bursts, and core-collapse supernovae. We find
that the worst effects occur when the glitch is coincident with the signal
maximum, and the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the glitch is larger than the
signal SNR. We have shown that for accurate parameter estimation of future
gravitational wave signals it will be essential to develop further methods to
either remove or reduce the effect of the glitches.

that, when combined with recent data, this prior can be rapidly adapted to the
local context. Our experiments demonstrate online adaptation for continuous
control tasks on both simulated and real-world agents. We first show simulated
agents adapting their behavior online to novel terrains, crippled body parts,

incorporating online adaptation into autonomous agents that operate in the real

demonstrate the agent's learned ability to quickly adapt online to a missing

based on a composite 3D face shape model with latent representations. We devise
a training process for the proposed network with a joint loss measuring both

training data we develop a method for fitting 3D morphable model (3DMM) to
multiple 2D images of a subject. Comprehensive experiments have been done on
MICC, BU3DFE, LFW and YTF databases. The results show that our method expands
the capacity of 3DMM for capturing discriminative shape features and facial

linearly stable, partitioned solvers for multiphysics problems from a
monolithic implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta (IMEX-RK) discretization of the
semi-discrete equations. The generic multiphysics problem is modeled as a
system of n systems of partial differential equations where the ith subsystem
is coupled to the other subsystems through a coupling term that can depend on
the state of all the other subsystems. This coupled system of partial
differential equations reduces to a coupled system of ordinary differential
equations via the method of lines where an appropriate spatial discretization
is applied to each subsystem. The coupled system of ordinary differential
equations is taken as a monolithic system and discretized using an IMEX-RK
discretization with a specific implicit-explicit decomposition that introduces
the concept of a predictor for the coupling term. We propose four coupling
predictors that enable the monolithic system to be solved in a partitioned
manner and preserve the IMEX-RK structure and therefore the design order of
accuracy of the monolithic scheme. The four partitioned solvers that result
from these predictors are high-order accurate, allow for maximum re-use of
existing single-physics software, and two of the four solvers allow the
subsystems to be solved in parallel at a given stage and time step. We also
analyze the stability of a coupled, linear model problem and show that one of
the partitioned solvers achieves unconditional linear stability, while the
others are unconditionally stable only for certain values of the coupling
strength. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed partitioned solvers on
several classes of multiphysics problems including a simple linear system of
ODEs, advection-diffusion-reaction systems, FSI problems, and particle-laden
flows.

that nitrogen atoms reside predominantly on the droplet surface where they

that are likely precursors for the thermal nucleation of cap structures. Once
formed, the caps are stable and can easily incorporate nitrogen and boron atoms

shape analysis using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our method well
utilizes the sparse occupancy of 3D shape boundary and builds hierarchical hash
tables for an input model under different resolutions. Based on this data
structure, we design two efficient GPU algorithms namely hash2col and col2hash
so that the CNN operations like convolution and pooling can be efficiently
parallelized. The spatial hashing is nearly minimal, and our data structure is
almost of the same size as the raw input. Compared with state-of-the-art
octree-based methods, our data structure significantly reduces the memory
footprint during the CNN training. As the input geometry features are more
compactly packed, CNN operations also run faster with our data structure. The
experiment shows that, under the same network structure, our method yields
comparable or better benchmarks compared to the state-of-the-art while it has
only one-third memory consumption. Such superior memory performance allows the
CNN to handle high-resolution shape analysis.

pulsation period reduction is due to both the stellar radius decrease during
the thermal pulse of the helium burning shell and mode switch from the
fundamental mode to the first overtone. Theoretical estimates of the
fundamental parameters of the star at the onset of pulsation period reduction
are as follows: the mass is $M=0.93M_\odot$, the luminosity is $L =

one hand, it can be easily trapped in a local minimum. On the other hand, the
inversion results may exhibit strong artifacts and reduced resolution because
of inadequate constraint from data. Proper regularizations are necessary to
reduce such artifacts and steer the inversion towards a good direction. In this
study, we propose a novel adaptive sparsity-promoting regularization for FWI in
the model-derivative domain which exploits nonlocal similarity in the model.
This regularization can be viewed as a generalization of total variation (TV)
with multi-class learning-based dictionaries. The dictionaries incorporate the
prior information of nonlocal similarity into the inversion, exploiting the
fact that geological patterns at different places are similar to some others up
to affine transformations (translation, rotation and scaling). Such nonlocal
similarity priors effectively reduce the degrees of freedom in model
parameters, and may also mitigate the problem of local minima. The formulated
optimization problem is solved by the Alternating Direction Method of
Multipliers (ADMM). By interpreting the iterative scheme, we find our method
closely connected with image processing techniques and convolutional neural
networks (CNN). We test our proposed method on a modified BP 2004 velocity
model and a smoothed Marmousi model. Compared with traditional FWI, our
technique can better reconstruct sharp edges such as salt body boundaries, and
is also able to effectively reduce artifacts. Compared with TV, our result is
less blocky and more geologically realistic. Quantitatively, our result has the
highest structural similarity index (SSIM) and also the lowest model mean
square error.

long-term stability properties. For a phase oscillator, we find that,
counter-intuitively, such variation is guaranteed to enlarge the Arnold tongue
in parameter space. Using analytical and numerical methods that provide
information on time-variable dynamical properties, we find that the growth of
the Arnold tongue is specifically due to the growth of a region of intermittent
synchronisation where trajectories alternate between short-term stability and
short-term neutral stability, giving rise to stability on average. We also
present examples of higher-dimensional nonlinear oscillators where a similar
stabilisation phenomenon is numerically observed. Our findings help support the
case that in general, deterministic non-autonomous perturbation is a very good
candidate for stabilising complex dynamics.

centres of merging galaxies realised with a stellar mass function (SMF) is
studied from the onset of galaxy mergers till coalescence. We performed a large
set of direct N-body simulations with three different slopes of the central
stellar cusp and different random seeds. Post Newtonian terms up to order 3.5
are used to drive the SMBH binary evolution in the relativistic regime. The
impact of a SMF on the hardening rate and the coalescence time is investigated.
We find that SMBH binaries coalesce well within one billion years when our
models are scaled to galaxies with a steep cusp at low redshift. Here higher
central densities provide larger supply of stars to efficiently extract energy
from the SMBH binary orbit and shrink it to the phase where gravitational wave
(GW) emission becomes dominant leading to the coalescence of the SMBHs. Mergers
of models with shallow cusps that are representative for giant elliptical
galaxies having central cores result in less efficient extraction of binary
orbital energy due to the lower stellar densities in the centre. However, high
values of eccentricity witnessed for SMBH binaries in such galaxy mergers
ensure that the GW emission dominated phase sets in earlier at larger values of
the semi-major axis. This helps to compensate for the less efficient energy
extraction during the phase dominated by stellar encounters resulting in
mergers of SMBHs in about one Gyr after the formation of the binary.
Additionally, we witness mass segregation in the merger remnant resulting in
enhanced SMBH binary hardening rates. We show that at least the final phase of
the merger in cuspy low mass galaxies would be observable with the GW detector
eLISA.

breakthrough of salient object detection. However, existing CNN-based methods
are based on either patch-wise (region-wise) training and inference or fully
convolutional networks. Methods in the former category are generally
time-consuming due to severe storage and computational redundancies among
overlapping patches. To overcome this deficiency, methods in the second
category attempt to directly map a raw input image to a predicted dense
saliency map in a single network forward pass. Though being very efficient, it
is arduous for these methods to detect salient objects of different scales or
salient regions with weak semantic information. In this paper, we develop
hybrid contrast-oriented deep neural networks to overcome the aforementioned
limitations. Each of our deep networks is composed of two complementary
components, including a fully convolutional stream for dense prediction and a
segment-level spatial pooling stream for sparse saliency inference. We further
propose an attentional module that learns weight maps for fusing the two
saliency predictions from these two streams. A tailored alternate scheme is
designed to train these deep networks by fine-tuning pre-trained baseline
models. Finally, a customized fully connected CRF model incorporating a salient

to improve spatial coherence and contour positioning in the fused result from

damping effects, we can transform the GW strain expression in a viscous
Universe into the same form as that in a perfect fluid. Therefore, the
constraints of the luminosity distances from the observed GW events by LIGO and
Virgo can be directly applied to the effective distances in our formalism. We
exploit the lognormal likelihoods for the available GW effective distances and
a Gaussian likelihood for the luminosity distance inferred from the
electromagnetic radiation observation of the binary neutron star merger event
GW170817. Our fittings show no obvious damping effects in the current GW data,
and the upper limit on the damping rate with the combined data is $6.75 \times
10^{-4}\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at 95\% confidence level. By assuming that the dark
matter self-scatterings are efficient enough for the hydrodynamic description
to be valid, we find that a GW event from its source at a luminosity distance

derive an objective function from the variational lower bound of the VAE

posterior reconstruction objective, naturally admitting a training regime that
leads to a coherent latent space across multiple modalities such as RGB images,
2D keypoint detections or 3D hand configurations. Additionally, it grants a
straightforward way of using semi-supervision. This latent space can be
directly used to estimate 3D hand poses from RGB images, outperforming the

distributed optimal control protocol is presented for the followers to not only
assure that their outputs fall into the convex hull of the leaders' output
(i.e., the desired or safe region), but also optimizes their transient
performance. The proposed optimal control solution is composed of a feedback
part, depending of the followers' state, and a feed-forward part, depending on
the convex hull of the leaders' state. To comply with most real-world
applications, the feedback and feed-forward states are assumed to be
unavailable and are estimated using two distributed observers. That is, since
the followers cannot directly sense their absolute states, a distributed
observer is designed that uses only relative output measurements with respect
to their neighbors (measured for example by using range sensors in robotic) and
the information which is broadcasted by their neighbors to estimate their
states. Moreover, another adaptive distributed observer is designed that uses
exchange of information between followers over a communication network to
estimate the convex hull of the leaders' state. The proposed observer relaxes
the restrictive requirement of knowing the complete knowledge of the leaders'
dynamics by all followers. An off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm on an
actor-critic structure is next developed to solve the optimal containment
control problem online, using relative output measurements and without
requirement of knowing the leaders' dynamics by all followers. Finally, the
theoretical results are verified by numerical simulations.

the so-called SPT-CS-PL approach, the Carnahan-Starling (CS) correction is
introduced to improve the description of thermodynamic properties of the fluid,
while the Parsons-Lee (PL) correction is introduced to improve the

analysis of a nonlinear integral equation for the singlet distribution function

compared with computer simulation data. Both ways and both approaches
considerably improve the description in the case of spherocylinder fluids with

topologically nontrivial in its bulk. The resulting shift in position of the
Majorana bound states is demonstrated to significantly affect its signatures in
Josephson-junction experiments. We discuss Josephson scanning tunneling
microscopy as a probe to resolve the Friedel-like oscillations as well as the
spatial texture of competing s-wave superconductivity and Majorana bound states
in the vicinity of the edge of the system.

increasing values of the spin, the shapes of the wormhole shadows start
deviating considerably from that of the black hole. Such considerable

Two types of reconstructors are customized to employ the backward flow and
reproduce the video features based on the hidden state sequence generated by

extensively studied and applied in different domains, such as image captioning,

namely Auto-Reconstructor Network (ARNet), which, coupling with the
conventional encoder-decoder framework, works in an end-to-end fashion to
generate captions. ARNet aims at reconstructing the previous hidden state with
the present one, besides behaving as the input-dependent transition operator.
Therefore, ARNet encourages the current hidden state to embed more information
from the previous one, which can help regularize the transition dynamics of
recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Extensive experimental results show that our
proposed ARNet boosts the performance over the existing encoder-decoder models
on both image captioning and source code captioning tasks. Additionally, ARNet
remarkably reduces the discrepancy between training and inference processes for
caption generation. Furthermore, the performance on permuted sequential MNIST
demonstrates that ARNet can effectively regularize RNN, especially on modeling
long-term dependencies. Our code is available at:

or locally connected to a given cluster is a natural probe of the growth of
structure and in particular of the nature of dark energy. It is also a critical
ingredient driving the assembly history of galaxies as it controls mass and
angular momentum accretion. The connectivity of the cosmic web is investigated
here via the persistent skeleton. This tool identifies topologically the set of
ridges of the cosmic landscape which allows us to investigate in details how
the nodes of the cosmic web are connected together. When applied to Gaussian
random fields, it is found that on average the nodes are connected to exactly
$\kappa=4$ neighbours in two dimensions and ~6.1 in three dimensions.
Investigating spatial dimensions up to d=11, typical departures from a cubic
lattice $\kappa=2d$ are shown to scale like the power 7/4 of the dimension.
These numbers strongly depend on the height of the peaks: the higher the peak
the larger the connectivity. Locally, the number of filaments sticking out from
a node is not equal to its number of connections. At small distance, the peak
has an ellipsoidal shape so that only two filaments emerge. Further away,
filaments are subdivided at bifurcation points. At the resolution of the maps,
the local number of filaments is 3 on average in 2D and 4 in 3D, depending on
the height of the peak. Predictions from first principles based on peak theory
are shown to reproduce well the connectivity and multiplicity of Gaussian
random fields and cosmological simulations. As an illustration, this
connectivity is quantified in galaxy lensing convergence maps and large dark
haloes catalogues. As a function of redshift and scale the mean connectivity
decreases in a cosmology dependent way. As a function of halo mass it scales
like 10/3 times the log of the mass.

the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) \gad \sp code, which ensures
approximate first-order consistency (i.e., second-order accuracy) for the
particle approximation. First-order consistency is restored by allowing the
number of neighbours, $n_{\rm neigh}$, and the smoothing length, $h$, to vary
with the total number of particles, $N$, such that the asymptotic limits
$n_{\rm neigh}\to\infty$ and $h\to 0$ hold as $N\to\infty$. The ability of the
method to reproduce the isothermal ($\gamma =1$) and adiabatic ($\gamma =5/3$)
Bondi accretion is investigated with increased spatial resolution. In
particular, for the isothermal models the numerical radial profiles closely
match the Bondi solution, except near the accretor, where the density and
radial velocity are slightly underestimated. However, as $n_{\rm neigh}$ is
increased and $h$ is decreased, the calculations approach first-order
consistency and the deviations from the Bondi solution decrease. The density
and radial velocity profiles for the adiabatic models are qualitatively similar
to those for the isothermal Bondi accretion. Steady-state Bondi accretion is
reproduced by the highly resolved consistent models with a percent relative
error of $\lesssim 1$\% for $\gamma =1$ and $\sim 9$\% for $\gamma =5/3$, with
the adiabatic accretion taking longer than the isothermal case to reach steady
flow. The performance of the method is assessed by comparing the results with
those obtained using the standard Gadget and the Gizmo codes.

by resonant point scatterers pinned at random positions in the free
three-dimensional (3D) space. A transition to Anderson localization takes place
in a narrow frequency band near the resonance frequency provided that the
number density of scatterers $\rho$ exceeds a critical value $\rho_c \simeq
0.08 k_0^{3}$, where $k_0$ is the wave number in the free space. The
localization condition $\rho > \rho_c$ can be rewritten as $k_0 \ell_0 < 1$,
where $\ell_0$ is the on-resonance mean free path in the independent-scattering
approximation. At mobility edges, the decay of the average amplitude of a
monochromatic plane wave is not purely exponential and the growth of its phase
is nonlinear with the propagation distance. This makes it impossible to define
the mean free path $\ell$ and the effective wave number $k$ in a usual way. If
the latter are defined as an effective decay length of the intensity and an
effective growth rate of the phase of the average wave field, the Ioffe-Regel
parameter $(k\ell)_c$ at the mobility edges can be calculated and takes values
from 0.3 to 1.2 depending on $\rho$. Thus, the Ioffe-Regel criterion of
localization $k\ell < (k\ell)_c = \mathrm{const} \sim 1$ is valid only
qualitatively and cannot be used as a quantitative condition of Anderson
localization in 3D.

approximates Minkowski space, one might perhaps expect there to be an
empirically identifiable preferred frame. However, the work of Dowker,
Bombelli, Henson, and Sorkin might be taken to suggest that random sprinklings
of points in Minkowski space define a discrete model that is provably
Poincar\'e invariant in a natural sense. We examine this possibility here. We
argue that a genuinely Poincar\'e invariant model requires a probability
distribution on sprinklable sets -- Poincar\'e orbits of sprinklings -- rather
than individual sprinklings. The corresponding $\sigma$-algebra contains only
sets of measure zero or one. This makes testing the hypothesis of discrete
Poincar\'e invariance problematic, since any local violation of Poincar\'e
invariance, however gross and large scale, is possible, and cannot be said to
be improbable. We also note that the Bombelli-Henson-Sorkin argument, which
rules out constructions of preferred timelike directions for typical
sprinklings, is not sufficient to establish full Lorentz invariance. For
example, once a pair of timelike separated points is fixed, a preferred
spacelike direction {\it can} be defined for a typical sprinkling, breaking the
remaining rotational invariance.

including a third degree of freedom due to wall effect to define the state of
the system, the tensorial character for pressure is considered. Using the
perturbation theory of statistical mechanics it is shown that the van der Waals
equation of state is equally valid for small as well as large systems. The
model proposed is shown to predict the liquid-vapor phase transition as well as
the critical point in any size confined fluid systems. It is also shown that
the critical temperature increases with the size of the nano system and finally
it reaches the macroscopic critical temperature value as the diameter of the
nanotube (or width of the nanoslit) approaches infinity. The proposed model can
also demonstrate the existence of the local density and phase fragmentations
during phase transitions in a confined nano system.

the transition terminates in a second-order critical point in the universality

independently and separately from each other. Here, we derive the
quantum-mechanical relation $R_{\rm vdW} = const. \times\alpha^{1/7}$ which is
markedly different from the common assumption $R_{\rm vdW} \propto

remarkably accurate way to calculate their equilibrium interatomic distance.
The revealed scaling law allows to reduce the empiricism and improve the

spherocylinders is constrained along an externally imposed direction field on
the sphere which is either along the longitude or the latitude lines of the
sphere. In both situations, integer orientational defects at the poles are
imposed. We show that these topological defects induce a complex segregation
picture also depending on the length ratio factor $\gamma$=$L_2/L_1$ and the
total packing fraction $\eta$ of the spherocylinders. When the binary mixture
is aligned along longitudinal lines of the sphere, shorter rods tend to
accumulate at the topological defects of the polar caps whereas longer rods
occupy central equatorial area of the spherical surface. In the reverse case of
latitude ordering, a state can emerge where longer rods are predominantly both
in the cap and in the equatorial areas and shorter rods are localized in
between. As a reference situation, we consider a defect-free situation in the
flat plane and do not find any length segregation there at similar $\gamma$ and
$\eta$, hence the segregation is purely induced by the imposed topological
defects. It is also revealed that the shorter rods at $\gamma$=4 and $\eta

to supplement cloud computing by deploying MEC servers to the network edge so
as to reduce the network delay and alleviate the load on cloud data centers.
However, compared to a resourceful cloud, an MEC server has limited resources.
When each MEC server operates independently, it cannot handle all of the
computational and big data demands stemming from the users devices.
Consequently, the MEC server cannot provide significant gains in overhead
reduction due to data exchange between users devices and remote cloud.
Therefore, joint computing, caching, communication, and control (4C) at the
edge with MEC server collaboration is strongly needed for big data
applications. In order to address these challenges, in this paper, the problem
of joint 4C in big data MEC is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal
is to maximize the bandwidth saving while minimizing delay, subject to the
local computation capability of user devices, computation deadline, and MEC
resource constraints. However, the formulated problem is shown to be
non-convex. To make this problem convex, a proximal upper bound problem of the
original formulated problem that guarantees descent to the original problem is
proposed. To solve the proximal upper bound problem, a block successive upper
bound minimization (BSUM) method is applied. Simulation results show that the
proposed approach increases bandwidth-saving and minimizes delay while
satisfying the computation deadlines.

motivated by neuroscience. Specifically, we are interested in a type of neuron
called a place cell, which fires precisely when an organism is in a certain
region, usually convex, called a place field. The earlier question, therefore,
can be rephrased as follows: Which neural codes, that is, patterns of neural
activity, can arise from a collection of convex open sets? To address this
question, Giusti and Itskov proved that convex neural codes have no ""local
obstructions,"" which are defined via the topology of a code's simplicial
complex. Codes without local obstructions are called locally good, because the
obstruction precludes the code from encoding the intersections of open sets
that form a good cover. In other words, every good-cover code is locally good.
Here we prove the converse: Every locally good code is a good-cover code. We
also prove that the good-cover decision problem is undecidable. Finally, we
reveal a stronger type of local obstruction that prevents a code from being
convex, and prove that the corresponding decision problem is NP-hard. Our
proofs use combinatorial and topological methods.

pseudoscalar quarkonia in the light-front Hamiltonian approach. The valence
sector light-front wavefunctions of heavy quarkonia are obtained from the Basis
Light-Front Quantization (BLFQ) approach in a holographic basis. We study the
transition form factor with both the traditional ""good current"" $J^+$ and the
transverse current $\vec J_\perp$ (in particular, $J^R=J^x+i J^y$). This allows
us to investigate the role of rotational symmetry by considering vector mesons
with different magnetic projections ($m_j=0,\pm 1$). We use the $m_j=0$ state
of the vector meson to obtain the transition form factor, since this procedure
employs the dominant spin components of the light-front wavefunctions and is
more robust in practical calculations. While the $m_j=\pm 1$ states are also
examined, transition form factors depend on subdominant components of the
light-front wavefunctions and are less robust. Transitions between states below
the open-flavor thresholds are computed, including those for excited states.
Comparisons are made with the experimental measurements as well as with Lattice
QCD and quark model results. In addition, we apply the transverse current to
calculate the decay constant of vector mesons where we obtain consistent
results using either $m_j=0$ or $m_j=1$ light-front wavefunctions. This
consistency provides evidence for features of rotational symmetry within the
model.

transient event in optical observations of M31 with the intermediate Palomar
Transient Factory (iPTF). The persistent optical counterpart of this transient
was previously thought to be a variable star in M31 without any dramatic flux
excursions. The iPTF event initially appeared to be an extraordinarily rapid
and energetic extragalactic transient, a very fast nova in M31 being one of the
exciting possibilities, with a ~3mag positive flux excursion in less than a
kilosecond. The nature of the source was resolved with the help of Chandra
archival data, where we found an X-ray counterpart and obtained its X-ray
spectrum. We find the X-ray spectrum of the quiescent emission can be described
by a model of optically thin plasma emission with a temperature of ~7MK,
typical for coronal emission from an active star. The combination of the X-ray
luminosity, calculated assuming the source is located in M31 (~3.10^36 erg/s),
and the color temperature exclude any type of known accreting compact object or
active star in M31. We argue instead that the optical transient source is an M

affinities between the microstates of a system. At the core of our construction
of the extended entropy ($\mathcal{H}$) is the concept of the effective number
of dissimilar states, termed the effective diversity ($\mathit{\Delta}$). It is
a unique integrated measure derived from the probability distribution among
states and the affinities between states. The effective diversity is related to
the extended entropy through the Boltzmann's-equation-like relation,
$\mathcal{H}=\ln_{q}\mathit{\Delta}$, in terms of the Tsallis' $q$-logarithm. A
new principle called the Nesting Principle is established, stating that the
effective diversity remains invariant under an arbitrary grouping of the
constituent states. It is shown that this invariance property holds only for
$q=2$; however, the invariance is recovered for general $q$ in the
zero-affinity limit (i.e. the Tsallis and Boltzmann-Gibbs case). Using the
affinity-based extended Tsallis entropy, the microcanonical and the canonical
ensembles are constructed in the presence of general between-state affinities.
It is shown that the classic postulate of equal a priori probabilities no
longer holds but is modified by affinity-dependent terms. As an illustration, a
two-level system is investigated by the extended canonical method, which
manifests that the thermal behaviours of the thermodynamic quantities at
equilibrium are affected by the between-state affinity. Furthermore, some
applications and implications of the affinity-based extended diversity/entropy

Nagel-Schreckenberg model (NaSch), an agent based stochastic model, is used as
a benchmark. The hydrodynamic model provides good approximations over short
time scales. The domain wall model is found to reproduce the time evolution of
local densities, in good agreement with the NaSch simulations for both short
and long time scales. A systematic investigation of the impact of network
parameters, including system sizes, cycle lengths, phase splits and signal
offsets, on traffic flows suggests that the stationary flow is dominated by the
boundary with the smaller split. Nevertheless, the signal offset plays an
important role in determining the flow. Analytical expressions of the flow in
relation to those parameters are obtained for the deterministic domain wall
model and match the deterministic NaSch simulations. The analytic results agree
qualitatively with the general stochastic models. When the cycle is
sufficiently short, the stationary state is governed by effective inflow and
outflow rates, and the density profile is approximately linear and independent
of time.

total hip prostheses have alarmed the medical and scientific community
regarding aging problems in zirconia prostheses. Such fractures cause immediate
local tissue reactions, which require urgent medical intervention to prevent
further complications. As a result, it has been promoted that yttria-stabilized
zirconia (Y-TZP) hip prostheses be substituted by alumina and alumina/Y-TZP
ceramics. In the present investigation, we have found an upper limit of Y-TZP
concentration in alumina/Y-TZP composites (16 vol.%) to avoid future aging
problems. This limit coincides with the percolation threshold measured by
infrared (IR) reflectance in a series of alumina/Y-TZP composites.

wave propagation in microstructured systems. Using a simple method, we derive
frequency-dependent homogenized parameters that reproduce the exact dispersion
relations of infinitely periodic flexural systems. Our scheme evades the need
to calculate field variables at each point, yet capable of recovering them, if
wanted. Through reflected energy analysis in scattering problems, we quantify
the applicability of the homogenized approximation. We show that at low
frequencies, our model replicates the transmission characteristics of
semi-infinite and finite periodic media. We quantify the decline in the
approximation as frequency increases, having certain characteristics sensitive
to microscale details. We observe that the homogenized model captures the
dynamic response of locally resonant media more accurately and across a wider
range of frequencies than the dynamic response of media without local
resonance.

bearing materials for orthopedics. Previous, preliminary reports show that such
alumina-zirconia nanocomposites exhibit high crack resistance and low wear
rate. In this paper, additional information is given in terms of wear, crack
resistance and ageing behaviour: femoral heads are inspected after 7 million
cycles of wear testing on a hip simulator, crack resistance is measured and
compared to other ceramics used today in orthopedics, slow crack growth is
reported under static and cyclic fatigue, and aging resistance is assessed. We
also report on the load to failure of femoral heads prototypes during
compression tests. This overall reliability assessment ensures a potential
future development for these kinds of new nanocomposites in the orthopedic
field.

  pseudo-noise strings with weak correlation",,,,,"cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a robust and blind watermarking method is proposed, which is
highly resistant to the common image watermarking attacks, such as noises,
compression, and image quality enhancement processing. In this method, Arnold
Cat map is used as a pre-processing on the host image, which increases the
security and imperceptibility of embedding watermark bits with a strong gain
factor. Moreover, two pseudo-noise strings with weak correlation are used as
the symbol of each 0 or 1 bit of the watermark, which increases the accuracy in
detecting the state of watermark bits at extraction phase in comparison to
using two random pseudo-noise strings. In this method, to increase the
robustness and further imperceptibility of the embedding, the Arnold Cat mapped
image is subjected to non-overlapping blocking, and then the high frequency
coefficients of the approximation sub-band of the FDCuT transform are used as
the embedding location for each block. Comparison of the proposed method with
recent robust methods under the same experimental conditions indicates the
superiority of the proposed method.

  Follower","A working manuscript with 9 pages and 5 figures",,,,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A recently introduced Early modeling of transistors is applied to the study
of the common collector amplifier (or emitter follower), an important type of
electronic circuit typically employed as buffer, being characterized by near
unit voltage gain, high input resistance, and low output resistance. The Early
equivalent model is applied to derive a simple representation that is simple
and yet capable of incorporating the transistor non-linearities implied by the
Early effect. Mathematical expressions are obtained describing completely the
circuit operation in terms of currents and voltages, allowing accurate
estimation of the average voltage gain, total harmonic distortion (THD), and
average input and output resistances. Prototypes of small signal silicon
transistors of types NPN and PNP obtained in a previous work are used to
discuss the respectively implied properties of the common collector transistor.
In addition to confirming the importance of the trade-off of current gain for
the desired properties, it is also shown that sub-optimal performance can be
obtained in case the base and emitter resistances are not properly chosen. Even
so, the limited current gain implied by real-world NPN and PNP small signal
silicon devices implies some performance constraints. In particular, it has
been observed that the THD tends to be larger for PNP devices than NPN
counterparts with the same average current gain. The obtained results pave the
way not only to complementary analytical studies, but also provide guidance for
design and implementation of improved common collector configurations.
