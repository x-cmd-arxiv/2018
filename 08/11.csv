normalized reconnection rate of $0.18\pm0.035$. Minimum variance analysis of
the electron velocity (MVA-$v_e$), MVA of $E$, minimization of Faraday residue,
and an adjusted version of the maximum directional derivative of the magnetic
field (MDD-$B$) technique all produce {reasonably} similar coordinate axes. We
use virtual MMS data from a particle-in-cell simulation of this event to
estimate the errors in the coordinate axes and reconnection rate associated
with MVA-$v_e$ and MDD-$B$. The $L$ and $M$ directions are most reliably
determined by MVA-$v_e$ when the spacecraft observes a clear electron jet
reversal. When the magnetic field data has errors as small as 0.5\% of the
background field strength, the $M$ direction obtained by MDD-$B$ technique may
be off by as much as 35$^\circ$. The normal direction is most accurately
obtained by MDD-$B$. Overall, we find that these techniques were able to

  Discriminative Event Based Modeling",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by a cascade of biomarkers becoming
abnormal, the pathophysiology of which is very complex and largely unknown.
Event-based modeling (EBM) is a data-driven technique to estimate the sequence
in which biomarkers for a disease become abnormal based on cross-sectional
data. It can help in understanding the dynamics of disease progression and
facilitate early diagnosis and prognosis. In this work we propose a novel
discriminative approach to EBM, which is shown to be more accurate than
existing state-of-the-art EBM methods. The method first estimates for each
subject an approximate ordering of events. Subsequently, the central ordering
over all subjects is estimated by fitting a generalized Mallows model to these
approximate subject-specific orderings. We also introduce the concept of
relative distance between events which helps in creating a disease progression
timeline. Subsequently, we propose a method to stage subjects by placing them
on the estimated disease progression timeline. We evaluated the proposed method
on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data and compared the
results with existing state-of-the-art EBM methods. We also performed extensive
experiments on synthetic data simulating the progression of Alzheimer's
disease. The event orderings obtained on ADNI data seem plausible and are in
agreement with the current understanding of progression of AD. The proposed
patient staging algorithm performed consistently better than that of
state-of-the-art EBM methods. Event orderings obtained in simulation
experiments were more accurate than those of other EBM methods and the
estimated disease progression timeline was observed to correlate with the
timeline of actual disease progression. The results of these experiments are
encouraging and suggest that discriminative EBM is a promising approach to
disease progression modeling.

apply the approach to vertically stacked van der Waals heterostructures made of

Indoor environments are particularly suitable for novel view prediction, since
the set of objects in such environments is relatively restricted. In this work
we address the task of 3D prediction especially for indoor scenes by leveraging
only weak supervision. In the literature 3D scene prediction is usually solved
via a 3D voxel grid. However, such methods are limited to estimating rather
coarse 3D voxel grids, since predicting entire voxel spaces has large
computational costs. Hence, our method operates in image-space rather than in
voxel space, and the task of 3D estimation essentially becomes a depth image
completion problem. We propose a novel approach to easily generate training
data containing depth maps with realistic occlusions, and subsequently train a
network for completing those occluded regions. Using multiple publicly

triclinic ReSe2, mechanically exfoliated onto a SiO2 layer grown on p-doped Si.
In contrast to previous reports on thin layers (~2 to 3 layers), we extract
field-effect carrier mobilities in excess of 10^2 cm^2/Vs at room temperature
in crystals with nearly ~10 atomic layers. These thicker FETs also show nearly
zero threshold gate voltage for conduction and high ON to OFF current ratios
when compared to the FETs built from thinner layers. We also demonstrate that
it is possible to utilize this ambipolarity to fabricate logical elements or
digital synthesizers. For instance, we demonstrate that one can produce simple,
gate-voltage tunable phase modulators with the ability to shift the phase of
the input signal by either 90^o or nearly 180^o. Given that it is possible to
engineer these same elements with improved architectures, for example on h-BN
in order to decrease the threshold gate voltage and increase the carrier
mobilities, it is possible to improve their characteristics in order to
engineer ultra-thin layered logic elements based on ReSe2.

used Hamiltonian simulation tool, the Trotter-Suzuki scheme splits the
evolution into the number of Trotter steps $N$ and approximates the evolution
of each step by a product of exponentials of each individual term of the total
Hamiltonian. The algorithmic error due to the approximation can be reduced by
increasing $N$, which however requires a longer circuit and hence inevitably
introduces more physical errors. In this work, we first study such a trade-off
and numerically find the optimal number of Trotter steps $N_{\textrm{opt}}$
given a physical error model in a near-term quantum hardware. Practically,
physical errors can be suppressed using recently proposed error mitigation
methods. We then extend physical error mitigation methods to suppress the
algorithmic error in Hamiltonian simulation. By exploiting the simulation
results with different numbers of Trotter steps $N\le N_{\textrm{opt}}$, we can
infer the exact simulation result within a higher accuracy and hence mitigate
algorithmic errors. We numerically test our scheme with a five qubit system and
show significant improvements in the simulation accuracy by applying both
physical and algorithmic error mitigations.

  finite element flux approximations",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The construction of finite element approximations in $\mathbf{H}(\mbox{div},
{\Omega})$ usually requires the Piola transformation to map vector polynomials
from a master element to vector fields in the elements of a partition of the
region {\Omega}. It is known that degradation may occur in convergence order if
non affine geometric mappings are used. On this point, we revisit a general
procedure for the improvement of two-dimensional flux approximations discussed
in a recent paper of this journal (Comput. Math. Appl. 74 (2017) 3283-3295).
The starting point is an approximation scheme, which is known to provide
$L^2$-errors with accuracy of order $k+1$ for sufficiently smooth flux
functions, and of order $r+1$ for flux divergence. An example is $RT_{k}$
spaces on quadrilateral meshes, where $r = k$ or $k-1$ if linear or bilinear
geometric isomorphisms are applied. Furthermore, the original space is required
to be expressed by a factorization in terms of edge and internal shape flux
functions. The goal is to define a hierarchy of enriched flux approximations to
reach arbitrary higher orders of divergence accuracy $r+n+1$ as desired, for
any $n \geq 1$. The enriched versions are defined by adding higher degree
internal shape functions of the original family of spaces at level $k+n$, while
keeping the original border fluxes at level $k$. The case $n=1$ has been
discussed in the mentioned publication for two particular examples. General
stronger enrichment $n>1$ shall be analyzed and applied to Darcy's flow
simulations, the global condensed systems to be solved having same dimension
and structure of the original scheme.

high-resolution Doppler spectroscopy in the near-infrared has allowed
detections of H$_2$O and CO in the atmospheres of several hot Jupiters. This
method involves monitoring the spectral lines of the planetary thermal emission
Doppler-shifted due to the radial velocity of the planet over its orbit.
However, aside from CO and H$_2$O, which are the primary oxygen- and
carbon-bearing species in hot H$_2$-rich atmospheres, little else is known
about molecular compositions of hot Jupiters. Several recent studies have
suggested the importance and detectability of nitrogen-bearing species in such
atmospheres. In this Letter, we confirm potential detections of CO and H$_2$O
in the hot Jupiter HD 209458b using high-resolution spectroscopy. We also
report a cross-correlation peak with a signal-to-noise ratio of $4.7$ from a
search for HCN. The results are obtained using high-resolution phase-resolved
spectroscopy with the Very Large telescope CRyogenic high-resolution InfraRed
Echelle Spectrograph (VLT CRIRES) and standard analysis methods reported in the

magneto-electric and magneto-thermal transport properties. In this paper, we
explore the impact of the tilting of the Weyl nodes, which breaks the
time-reversal symmetry, on the magneto-electric conductivity of type-I and
type-II Weyl semimetals. Using the Berry curvature connected Boltzmann
transport formalism, we find that in addition to the quadratic-B corrections
induced by the tilt, there are also anisotropic and B-linear corrections in
several elements of the conductivity matrix. For the case of magnetic field
applied perpendicular to the tilt direction, we show the existence of finite
B-linear transverse conductivity components. For the other case of magnetic
field applied parallel to the tilt axis, the B-linear corrections appear in the
longitudinal conductivity and will result in asymmetric lineshape in the
magneto-resistence measurements. Unlike the quadratic-B corrections, these
linear corrections are independent of the chemical potential, and are sensitive
to the direction of the tilt axis and the applied magnetic field. Our
systematic analysis of the full magneto-electric conductivity matrix, predicts
several specific experimental signatures related to the tilting of the Weyl
nodes in both type-I and type-II Weyl semimetals.

or $d$-wave superconductor (S) and a topological insulator (TI). Integrating
out the topological fermions of the TI, we find that spin-orbit coupling is
induced in the S, which leads to spin-triplet $p$-wave ($f$-wave) correlations
in the anomalous Green's function for an $s$-wave ($d$-wave) superconductor.
Solving the self-consistency equation for the superconducting order parameter,
we find that the inverse proximity effect can be strong for parameters for
which the Fermi momenta of the S and TI coincide. The suppression of the gap is
approximately proportional to $e^{-1/\lambda}$, where $\lambda$ is the
dimensionless superconducting coupling constant. This is consistent with the
fact that a higher $\lambda$ gives a more robust superconducting state. For an
$s$-wave S, the interval of TI chemical potentials for which the suppression of
the gap is strong is centered at $\mu_{TI} = \pm\sqrt{2mv_F^2\mu}$, and
increases quadratically with the hopping parameter $t$. Since the S chemical
potential $\mu$ typically is high for conventional superconductors, the inverse
proximity effect is negligible except for $t$ above a critical value. For
sufficiently low $t$, however, the inverse proximity effect is negligible, in
agreement with what has thus far been assumed in most works studying the
proximity effect in S-TI structures. In superconductors with low Fermi
energies, such as high-$T_c$ cuprates with $d$-wave symmetry, we again find a
suppression of the order parameter. However, since $\mu$ is much smaller in
this case, a strong inverse proximity effect can occur at $\mu_{TI}=0$ for much
lower values of $t$. Moreover, the onset of a strong inverse proximity effect
is preceded by an increase in the order parameter, allowing the gap to be tuned
by several orders of magnitude by small variations in $\mu_{TI}$.

poses important challenges related to the modeling of the variability and the
interpretability of the results. These issues are here addressed by proposing a
novel multi-channel stochastic generative model. We assume that a latent
variable generates the data observed through different channels (e.g., clinical
scores, imaging, ...) and describe an efficient way to estimate jointly the
distribution of both latent variable and data generative process. Experiments
on synthetic data show that the multi-channel formulation allows superior data
reconstruction as opposed to the single channel one. Moreover, the derived
lower bound of the model evidence represents a promising model selection
criterion. Experiments on AD data show that the model parameters can be used
for unsupervised patient stratification and for the joint interpretation of the
heterogeneous observations. Because of its general and flexible formulation, we

different approach to frequency estimation, which exploits quantum coherence in

assess specific aspects of joint-movement behaviour: proximity (closeness in
space-time) and coordination (synchrony) in direction and speed. We found that
some metrics are better suited to assess proximity and others are more
sensitive to coordination. To help readers choose metrics, we elaborate a

correlation spectroscopy. This work characterizes KGF secondary structure
reflected in the amide I region of the FTIR-ATR spectrum, and differences
between active and heat denatured KGF. These results have been used to
investigate the sequence of time-dependent changes in KGF at the surface of the
HEMA hydrogel during uptake and release by 2D correlation spectroscopy. KGF
stays active throughout the uptake process, and the KGF loop structures
interact with HEMA moieties, potentially mimicking receptor-ligand
interactions. KGF denatures during release via changes in the loops and
unfolding of the extended strands. Our results suggest that a high affinity
interaction between the HEMA hydrogel and KGF is beneficial for efficient
loading of KGF into the hydrogel, but is too strong and prevents complete KGF
release due to unfolding and denaturation of KGF. This work informs future
material design that will target different secondary structural elements of KGF
in order to preserve its native conformation and allow for complete release.

gaseous nebulae research at large, is the systematic discrepancies in electron
temperatures and ionic abundances as derived from recombination and
collisionally excited lines. Peimbert (1967) proposed the presence of
'temperature fluctuations' in these nebulae, but the apparent amplitude of such
fluctuations, as deduced from spectral diagnostics and/or abundance discrepancy
factors, remain unexplained by standard photoionization modeling. While this
and other alternative models to explain the temperature and abundance
discrepancies remain inconclusive, recent observations seem to point at a
connection between nebular abundance discrepancy factors and a binary nature of
photoionizing stars. In this paper we show that large amplitude temperature
fluctuations are expected to form in planetary nebulae photoionized by
short-period binary stars. Resonant temperature fluctuations are first formed
along the orbital disk around the binary stars, as the periodically varying
ionizing radiation field induces periodic oscillations in the
heating-minus-cooling function. Then, the temperatures fluctuations propagate
vertically to the disk as thermal waves that later steepen into radiative
shocks. The binary period of the ionizing stars is determinant in the formation
and propagation of temperature fluctuations, as well as in associated density
fluctuations. Fluctuations propagate efficiently only in systems with binary
periods significantly shorter than the gas thermalization time, of the order of
10 days.
  Further, we propose temperature diagnostic line ratios that combine [O III]
collisionally excited lines and O II recombination lines to determine the
equilibrium temperature and the magnitude of resonant temperature fluctuations
in nebulae.

an accessible orientation for receptor binding, and maximizing protein release.
We report here the evaluation of (hydroxyethyl)methacrylate (HEMA)-based
hydrogel systems for the delivery of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) to
promote re-epithelialization in wound healing. In this work, we characterize
two hydrogel blends in addition to HEMA alone, and report how protein
orientation, conformation, and protein release is affected. The first blend
incorporates methyl methacrylate (MMA), which is known to promote adsorption of
protein to its surface due to its hydrophobicity. The second blend incorporates
methacrylic acid (MAA), which is known to promote the diffusion of protein into
its surface due to its hydrophilicity. We find that KGF at the surface of the
HEMA/MMA blend appears to be more orientationally accessible and
conformationally active than KGF at the surface of the HEMA/MAA blend. We also
report that KGF at the surface of the HEMA/MAA blend becomes conformationally
denatured, likely due to hydrogen bonding. While KGF at the surface of these
blends can be differentiated by FTIR-ATR spectroscopy and ToF-SIMS in
conjunction with PCA, KGF swelling, uptake, and release profiles are
indistinguishable. The differences in KGF orientation and conformation between

the torus. We speculate that IRAS 15103-5754 was a triple stellar system that
went through a common envelope phase, and one of the components was ejected in
this process. A subsequent low-collimation wind from the remaining binary
stripped out gas from the torus, creating the conical outflow. The high
velocity of the outflow suggests that the momentum transfer from the wind was
extremely efficient, or that we are witnessing a very energetic mass-loss
event.

the standard model Z boson mass are analyzed, and the selection is further
optimized to be sensitive to the events that may contain Z $\to$ Z$'\mu\mu$

a Z$'$ boson coupling strength to muons above 0.004-0.3. These are the first
dedicated limits on $L_{\mu}$ $-$ $L_{\tau}$ models at the LHC and result in a
significant increase in the excluded model parameter space. The results of this

associated to all finite irreducible Coxeter groups inside their associated
finite Iwahori-Hecke algebra. This was done in type $A$ by Brunat, Magaard and
Marin. The Zariski closure of the image was determined in the generic case by
Marin. It is suggested by strong approximation that the results should be
similar in the finite case. However, the conditions required to use are much
too strong and would only provide a portion of the results. We show in this
thesis that they are but that new phenomena arise from the different field
factorizations. The techniques used in the finite case are very different from
the ones in the generic case. The main arguments come from finite group theory.
In high dimension, we will use a theorem by Guralnick-Saxl which uses the
classification of finite simple groups to give a condition for subgroups of
linear groups to be classical groups in a natural representation. In low
dimension, we will mainly use the classification of maximal subgroups of
classical groups determined by Bray, Holt and Roney-Dougal for the complicated
cases.
  We find some new $W$-graphs in types $H_4$, $E_6$ and $E_8$ which provide
different information from the usual ones. They are all associated in a natural
way to a bilinear form which is very complicated to obtain in the previous
models. In this model, the bilinear form is obtained using only the
two-colorability and its matrix in a well chosen basis is anti-diagonal. The
uniqueness properties can probably be extended in a more general setting and
understanding which setting this is may be worth considering.

magnetic regions, such as coronal holes, where they appear above
minority-polarity intrusions. Intermittent low-level reconnection and
explosive, high-energy-release reconnection above these intrusions are thought
to generate bright points and jets, respectively. The magnetic field above the
intrusions possesses a spine-fan topology with a coronal null point. The
movement of magnetic flux by surface convection adds free energy to this field,
forming current sheets and inducing reconnection. We conducted
three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of moving magnetic elements
as a model for coronal jets and bright points. A single minority-polarity
concentration was subjected to three different experiments: a large-scale
surface flow that sheared part of the separatrix surface only, a large-scale
surface flow that also sheared part of the polarity inversion line surrounding
the minority flux, and the latter flow setup plus a ""fly-by"" of a
majority-polarity concentration past the moving minority-polarity element. We
found that different bright-point morphologies, from simple loops to sigmoids,
were created. When only the field near the separatrix was sheared, steady
interchange reconnection modulated by quasi-periodic, low-intensity bursts of
reconnection occurred, suggestive of a bright point with periodically varying
intensity. When the field near the PIL was strongly sheared, on the other hand,
filament channels repeatedly formed and erupted via the breakout mechanism,
explosively increasing the interchange reconnection and generating non-helical
jets. The fly-by produced even more energetic and explosive jets. Our results
explain several key aspects of coronal-hole bright points and jets, and the
relationships between them.

these conditions typically involve stringent no unmeasured confounding

the mediator and unmeasured confounder(s). Second, we introduce a new estimator
of the natural indirect effect that is robust to both classical measurement

formal proofs and a simulation study to demonstrate our results.

low-dose and sparse CT images, we propose a novel method to reconstruct
high-quality 4D cone-beam CT (4DCBCT) images from sparse datasets. Our approach
combines the idea of 'bin-sharing' with a deep convolutional neural network
(CNN) model. More specifically, for each respiratory bin, an initial estimate
of the patient sinogram is obtained by taking projections from adjacent bins
and performing linear interpolation. Subsequently, the estimated sinogram is
propagated through a CNN that predicts a full, high-quality sinogram. Lastly,
the predicted sinogram is reconstructed with traditional CBCT algorithms such
as the Feldkamp, Davis and Kress (FDK) method. The CNN model, which we referred
to as the Sino-Net, was trained under different loss functions. We assessed the
performance of the proposed method in terms of image quality metrics (mean
square error, mean absolute error, peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural
similarity) and tumor motion accuracy (tumor centroid deviation with respect to
the ground truth). Overall, the presented prototype model was able to
substantially improve the quality of 4DCBCT images, removing most of the streak
artifacts and decreasing the noise with respect to the standard FDK
reconstructions. The tumor centroid deviations with respect to the ground truth
predicted by our method were approximately 0.5 mm, on average (maximum
deviation was approximately 2 mm). These preliminary results are promising and
encourage us to further investigate the performance of our model under more
challenging imaging conditions and compare it against the state-of-the-art CBCT
reconstruction algorithms.

generalizes the Kronrod rule for any continuous probability density function on

solve moment-matching conditions for two levels of main and nested rule and use
a penalty method to enforce the constraints on the limits of the nodes and

Gauss-Kronrod-Patterson rules by slightly modifying our algorithm and present
results associated with Chebyshev polynomials which are not reported elsewhere.

subsequences of individuals' genomes to the observable characteristics called
phenotypes (e.g., high blood pressure). Motivated by the GWAS problem, in this
paper we introduce the information-theoretic problem of \emph{associated
subsequence retrieval}, where a dataset of $N$ (possibly high-dimensional)
sequences of length $G$, and their corresponding observable (binary)
characteristics is given. The sequences are chosen independently and uniformly
at random from $\mathcal{X}^G$, where $\mathcal{X}$ is a finite alphabet. The
observable (binary) characteristic is only related to a specific unknown
subsequence of length $L$ of the sequences, called \textit{associated
subsequence}. For each sequence, if the associated subsequence of it belongs to
a universal finite set, then it is more likely to display the observable
characteristic (i.e., it is more likely that the observable characteristic is
one). The goal is to retrieve the associated subsequence using a dataset of $N$
sequences and their observable characteristics. We demonstrate that as the
parameters $N$, $G$, and $L$ grow, a threshold effect appears in the curve of
probability of error versus the rate which is defined as ${Gh(L/G)}/{N}$, where
$h(\cdot)$ is the binary entropy function. This effect allows us to define the
capacity of associated subsequence retrieval. We develop an achievable scheme
and a matching converse for this problem, and thus characterize its capacity in
two scenarios: the zero-error-rate and the $\epsilon$-error-rate.

execute recipe steps to produce semiconductor wafers. Multiple streaming
sensors capture trace data to guide the control systems and for quality
control. These control systems are typically PI controllers which can be
modeled as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) coupled with a control
equation, capturing the physics of the process. The ODE ""white-box"" models
capture physical causal relationships that can be used in simulations to
determine how the process will react to changes in control parameters, but they
have limited utility for anomaly detection. Many ""black-box"" approaches exist
for anomaly detection in manufacturing, but they typically do not exploit the
underlying process control. The proposed ""grey-box"" approach uses the
process-control ODE model to derive a parametric function of sensor data.
Bayesian regression is used to fit the parameters of these functions to form
characteristic ""shape signatures"". The probabilistic model provides a natural
anomaly score for each wafer, which captures poor control and strange shape
signatures. The anomaly score can be deconstructed into its constituent parts
in order to identify which parameters are contributing to anomalies. We
demonstrate how the anomaly score can be used to monitor complex multi-step
manufacturing processes to detect anomalies and changes and show how the shape
signatures can provide insight into the underlying sources of process variation

sensitivity analysis of this new pipeline in which multiple single pulses with

the pipeline. Based on the recovered pulses, we find that for pulse widths $\rm
< 5\ ms$ the sensitivity of the PALFA pipeline is at most a factor of $\rm \sim

widths $\rm > 10\ ms$, as the $\rm DM$ decreases, the degradation in
sensitivity gets worse and can increase up to a factor of $\rm \sim 4.5$. Using
this pipeline, we have thus far discovered 7 pulsars and 2 RRATs and identified
3 candidate RRATs and 1 candidate FRB. The confirmed pulsars and RRATs have DMs
ranging from 133 to 386 pc cm$^{-3}$ and flux densities ranging from 20 to 160

maximum along this line of sight of $\rm \sim$ 100 - 200 pc cm$^{-3}$. We
consider implications for the FRB population and show via simulations that if

gravitational-wave background. The stochastic background imparts a weak
correlated signal into networks of gravitational-wave detectors, and so
standard searches for the gravitational-wave background rely on measuring
cross-correlations between pairs of widely-separated detectors. Stochastic
searches, however, can be affected by any other correlated effects which may
also be present, including correlated frequency combs and magnetic Schumann
resonances. As stochastic searches become sensitive to ever-weaker signals, it
is increasingly important to develop methods to separate a true astrophysical
signal from other spurious and/or terrestrial signals. Here, we describe a
novel method to achieve this goal -- gravitational-wave geodesy. Just as radio
geodesy allows for the localization of radio telescopes, so too can
observations of the gravitational-wave background be used to infer the
positions and orientations of gravitational-wave detectors. By demanding that a
true observation of the gravitational-wave background yield constraints
consistent with the baseline's known geometry, we demonstrate that we can
successfully validate true observations of the gravitational-wave background
while rejecting spurious signals due to correlated terrestrial effects.

automatically translating the application's source code from COBOL to Java and
converting the mainframe data store from VSAM KSDS files to an Oracle
relational database. The mainframe application had supported daily home
delivery of the newspaper since 1979. It was in need of modernization in order
to increase interoperability and enable future convergence with newer
enterprise systems as well as to reduce operating costs. Testing the modernized
application proved to be the most vexing area of work. This paper explains the
process that was employed to test functional equivalence between the legacy and
modernized applications, the main testing challenges, and lessons learned after
having operated and maintained the modernized application in production over
the last eight months. The goal of delivering a functionally equivalent system
was achieved, but problems remained to be solved related to new feature
development, business domain knowledge transfer, and recruiting new software
engineers to work on the modernized application.

we give analytically the pair structure at the energy minimum, and discuss its
asymptotic behavior away from the Fermi surface, which looks quite simple and
allows easy physical interpretations. The new algorithm iterates these

in a semi-realistic example using the realistic $V_{low-k}$ interaction and
large model spaces (up to 15 harmonic-oscillator major shells). The energy can

We perform an empirical study comparing state-of-the-art traditional
feature-based and neural network-based models for two core natural language
processing tasks of part-of-speech (POS) tagging and dependency parsing on two
benchmark biomedical corpora, GENIA and CRAFT. To the best of our knowledge,
there is no recent work making such comparisons in the biomedical context;

Experimental results show that in general, the neural models outperform the

engineering. However, except Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) and
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), most of existing topic models are seldom
applied or considered in industrial scenarios. This phenomenon is caused by the
fact that there are very few convenient tools to support these topic models so
far. Intimidated by the demanding expertise and labor of designing and
implementing parameter inference algorithms, software engineers are prone to
simply resort to PLSA/LDA, without considering whether it is proper for their
problem at hand or not. In this paper, we propose a configurable topic modeling
framework named Familia, in order to bridge the huge gap between academic
research fruits and current industrial practice. Familia supports an important
line of topic models that are widely applicable in text engineering scenarios.
In order to relieve burdens of software engineers without knowledge of Bayesian
networks, Familia is able to conduct automatic parameter inference for a
variety of topic models. Simply through changing the data organization of
Familia, software engineers are able to easily explore a broad spectrum of
existing topic models or even design their own topic models, and find the one
that best suits the problem at hand. With its superior extendability, Familia
has a novel sampling mechanism that strikes balance between effectiveness and
efficiency of parameter inference. Furthermore, Familia is essentially a big
topic modeling framework that supports parallel parameter inference and
distributed parameter storage. The utilities and necessity of Familia are
demonstrated in real-life industrial applications. Familia would significantly
enlarge software engineers' arsenal of topic models and pave the way for
utilizing highly customized topic models in real-life problems.

that the traveling wave profiles are time asymptotic limits for the
corresponding Cauchy problems, under mild assumptions on the smooth initial

obtaining conclusions from non-monotonic knowledge systems. Within such a
system, an argumentation semantics is defined as a set of arguments with some
desired qualities, for example, that the elements are not in conflict with each
other. Splitting an argumentation framework can efficiently speed up the
computation of argumentation semantics. With respect to stable semantics, two
methods have been proposed to split an argumentation framework either in a
unidirectional or bidirectional fashion. The advantage of bidirectional
splitting is that it is not structure-dependent and, unlike unidirectional
splitting, it can be used for frameworks consisting of a single strongly
connected component. Bidirectional splitting makes use of a minimum cut. In
this paper, we implement and test the performance of the bidirectional
splitting method, along with two types of graph cut algorithms. Experimental
data suggest that using a minimum cut will not improve the performance of
computing stable semantics in most cases. Hence, instead of a minimum cut, we
propose to use a balanced cut, where the framework is split into two
sub-frameworks of equal size. Experimental results conducted on bidirectional
splitting using the balanced cut show a significant improvement in the
performance of computing semantics.

campaigners and publishers, it is fundamentally critical to estimate the
contribution from ad campaign touch-points during the customer journey
(conversion funnel) and assign the right credit to the right ad exposure
accordingly. However, the existing research on the multi-touch attribution
problem lacks a principled way of utilizing the users' pre-conversion actions
(i.e., clicks), and quite often fails to model the sequential patterns among
the touch points from a user's behavior data. To make it worse, the current
industry practice is merely employing a set of arbitrary rules as the
attribution model, e.g., the popular last-touch model assigns 100% credit to
the final touch-point regardless of actual attributions. In this paper, we
propose a Dual-attention Recurrent Neural Network (DARNN) for the multi-touch
attribution problem. It learns the attribution values through an attention
mechanism directly from the conversion estimation objective. To achieve this,
we utilize sequence-to-sequence prediction for user clicks, and combine both
post-view and post-click attribution patterns together for the final conversion

novel yet practical attribution evaluation scheme through the proxy of budget
allocation (under the estimated attributions) over ad channels. The

where all potential 6D trajectories are searched using ultrafast optimization
methods and the best trajectory is chosen. As the method formulates the problem
as an objective function to be solved, it allows high flexibility in that users
can optimize various performance requirements such as mechanical robot limits,

Developing an effective method topredict disulfide bonding formation is

introduced a nested structure of Bidirectional Long-short Term

introduced aboveLocal-BLSTM layer to integrate context-based features of all
Cys residues in the same protein chain, therebyinvolving inter-residue

computing the quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of a massive scalar field in the
wormhole background. We investigate the dependence of quasi-normal frequencies
on the mass of scalar field as well as other parameters of the wormhole. It is
found that the perturbations are always stable for the wormhole geometry which
has the general relativity (GR) limit when the scalar field mass m satisfies a
certain, tachyonic mass bound m^2 > m^2_* with m^2_* < 0, analogous to the
Breitenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound in the global-AdS space, m^2_BF = 3 Lambda/4.
It is also found that the BF-like bound m^2_* shifts by the changes of the
cosmological constant Lambda or angular-momentum number l, with a level
crossing between the lowest complex and pure-imaginary modes for zero angular
momentum l = 0. Furthermore, it is found that the unstable modes can also have
oscillatory parts as well as non-oscillatory parts depending on whether the
real and imaginary parts of frequencies are dependent on each other or not,
contrary to arguments in the literature. For wormhole geometries which do not
have the GR limit, the BF-like bound does not occur and the perturbations are
stable for arbitrary tachyonic and non-tachyonic masses, up to a critical mass
m^2_c > 0 where the perturbations are completely frozen.

pattern in the network. The routing scheme ensures only certain capsules which
resemble lower counterparts in the higher layer should be activated. However,
the computational complexity becomes a bottleneck for scaling up to larger
networks, as lower capsules need to correspond to each and every higher
capsule. To resolve this limitation, we approximate the routing process with
two branches: a master branch which collects primary information from its
direct contact in the lower layer and an aide branch that replenishes master
based on pattern variants encoded in other lower capsules. Compared with
previous iterative and unsupervised routing scheme, these two branches are
communicated in a fast, supervised and one-time pass fashion. The complexity
and runtime of the model are therefore decreased by a large margin. Motivated
by the routing to make higher capsule have agreement with lower capsule, we
extend the mechanism as a compensation for the rapid loss of information in
nearby layers. We devise a feedback agreement unit to send back higher capsules
as feedback. It could be regarded as an additional regularization to the
network. The feedback agreement is achieved by comparing the optimal transport
divergence between two distributions (lower and higher capsules). Such an
add-on witnesses a unanimous gain in both capsule and vanilla networks. Our
proposed EncapNet performs favorably better against previous state-of-the-arts
on CIFAR10/100, SVHN and a subset of ImageNet.

differential brightness, i.e., the difference in sky brightness from the
average at high ecliptic latitude, and compared with that expected from the

good correlation between the J-band model zodiacal light and the residual sky
brightness after subtracting the ISL and DGL. The reflectances of the
interplanetary dust derived from the correlation study are marginally
consistent with previous works. The zodiacal light is not significantly
detectable at r>3 au, as previously reported. However, a clear discrepancy from

restoration over the horizon after disasters . That is, total recovery time and
the skew of the recovery trajectory. Both metrics are involved in the
multi-objective stochastic optimization problem of restoration scheduling. The
metrics provided a new dimension to evaluate the relative efficiency of

mergers play principal roles in powering kilonovae. In previous studies
power-law-type heating rates (e.g., ~ t^-1.3) have frequently been used, which
may be inadequate if the ejecta are dominated by nuclei other than the A ~ 130
region. We consider, therefore, two reference abundance distributions that
match the r-process residuals to the solar abundances for A >= 69 (light
trans-iron plus r-process elements) and A >= 90 (r-process elements).
Nucleosynthetic abundances are obtained by using free-expansion models with
three parameters: expansion velocity, entropy, and electron fraction.
Radioactive energies are calculated as an ensemble of weighted free-expansion
models that reproduce the reference abundance patterns. The results are
compared with the bolometric luminosity (> a few days since merger) of the
kilonova associated with GW170817. We find that the former case (fitted for A
>= 69) with an ejecta mass 0.06 M_sun reproduces the light curve remarkably
well including its steepening at > 7 days, in which the mass of r-process
elements is ~ 0.01 M_sun. Two beta-decay chains are identified: 66Ni -> 66Cu ->
66Zn and 72Zn -> 72Ga -> 72Ge with similar halflives of parent isotopes (~ 2
days), which leads to an exponential-like evolution of heating rates during
1-15 days. The light curve at late times (> 40 days) is consistent with
additional contributions from the spontaneous fission of 254Cf and a few Fm
isotopes. If this is the case, the event GW170817 is best explained by the
production of both light trans-iron and r-process elements that originate from
dynamical ejecta and subsequent disk outflows from the neutron star merger.

also preserves the number of crossings. Due to the fact that the sets of
non-nesting permutations and 321-avoiding permutations are the same, these
properties of the bijection $\Theta$ leads to an unexpected result related to

us to understand how people, who are from different age group, sex and

further provides some initial evidence that participation in viral marketing

incorporated in an epidemiological model for mathematical treatment, to
indicate key operational factors in ensuring an effective spread of the

complex temporal dynamics. The systematic study of these two features of social
systems has started only very recently mainly thanks to the development of
multiplex and time-varying networks. However, these two advancements have
progressed almost in parallel with very little overlap. Thus, the interplay
between multiplexity and the temporal nature of connectivity patterns is poorly
understood. Here, we aim to tackle this limitation by introducing a
time-varying model of multiplex networks. We are interested in characterizing
how these two properties affect contagion processes. To this end, we study SIS
epidemic models unfolding at comparable time-scale respect to the evolution of
the multiplex network. We study both analytically and numerically the epidemic
threshold as a function of the overlap between, and the features of, each
layer. We found that, the overlap between layers significantly reduces the
epidemic threshold especially when the temporal activation patterns of
overlapping nodes are positively correlated. Furthermore, when the average
connectivity across layers is very different, the contagion dynamics are driven
by the features of the more densely connected layer. Here, the epidemic
threshold is equivalent to that of a single layered graph and the impact of the
disease, in the layer driving the contagion, is independent of the overlap.
However, this is not the case in the other layers where the spreading dynamics
are sharply influenced by it. The results presented provide another step
towards the characterization of the properties of real networks and their
effects on contagion phenomena

sensitivity. In particular, a magnetic sensor with a high spatial resolution
can be achieved with the electron-spin states of a nitrogen vacancy (NV) center
in diamond. In this study, we demonstrated that NV quantum sensing based on
multiple-pulse decoupling sequences can sensitively measure not only the
amplitude but also the phase shift of an alternating-current (AC) magnetic
field. In the AC magnetometry based on decoupling sequences, the maximum phase
accumulation of the NV spin due to an AC field can be generally obtained when
the $\pi$-pulse period in the sequences matches the half time period of the
field and the relative phase difference between the sequences and the field is
zero. By contrast, the NV quantum sensor acquires no phase accumulation if the
relative phase difference is $\pi/2$. Thus, this phase-accumulation condition
does not have any advantage for the magnetometry. However, we revealed that the
non-phase-accumulation condition is available for detecting a very small phase
shift of an AC field from its initial phase. This finding is expected to
provide a guide for realizing sensitive measurement of a complex AC magnetic
field in micrometer and nanometer scales.

Navier-Stokes equations within a time-dependent spatial domain that accounts
for the elasticity of the arterial walls. In this article blood is treated as
an incompressible Newtonian fluid that flows through compliant vessels of
general cross section. A three-dimensional semi-implicit finite difference and
finite volume model is derived so that numerical stability is obtained at a low
computational cost on a staggered grid. The key idea of the method consists in
a splitting of the pressure into a hydrostatic and a non-hydrostatic part,
where first a small quasi-one-dimensional nonlinear system is solved for the
hydrostatic pressure and only in a second step the fully three-dimensional
non-hydrostatic pressure is computed from a three-dimensional nonlinear system
as a correction to the hydrostatic one. The resulting algorithm is robust,
efficient, locally and globally mass conservative and applies to hydrostatic
and non hydrostatic flows in one, two and three space dimensions. These
features are illustrated on nontrivial test cases for flows in tubes with
circular or elliptical cross section where the exact analytical solution is
known. Test cases of steady and pulsatile flows in uniformly curved rigid and
elastic tubes are presented. Wherever possible, axial velocity development and
secondary flows are shown and compared with previously published results.

estimation for moment restriction models with data combination from two samples

leveraging the semiparametric efficiency theory, we derive an augmented inverse
probability weighted (AIPW) estimator that is locally efficient and doubly
robust with respect to the outcome regression and propensity score models.
Furthermore, we develop calibrated regression and likelihood estimators that
are not only locally efficient and doubly robust, but also intrinsically
efficient in achieving smaller variances than the AIPW estimator when the
propensity score model is correctly specified but the outcome regression model
may be misspecified. As an important application, we study the two-sample

escalation, creates the title and content of the ticket used by developers, and
assigns the ticket to an available developer. We internally evaluated the
method by 4,114 user tickets from Brightsquid and their secure health care
communication plat- form Secure-Mail. We also perform an external evaluation on

context specific data performs best for extractive summarization. For
predicting escalation of tickets, Random Forest trained on a combination of
conversation and extractive summarization is best with highest precision (of
0.9) and recall (of 0.55). From external evaluation we found that ESSMArT
provides suggestions that are 71% aligned with human ones. Applying the
prototype implementation to 315 user requests resulted in an average time
reduction of 9.2 minutes per request. ESSMArT helps to make ticket management

approaches to the Navier-Stokes solutions accurately. Furthermore, it is

  Extraction - the CLEAN Tool",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objective. Annotation is expensive but essential for clinical note review and
clinical natural language processing (cNLP). However, the extent to which
computer-generated pre-annotation is beneficial to human annotation is still an
open question. Our study introduces CLEAN (CLinical note rEview and
ANnotation), a pre-annotation-based cNLP annotation system to improve clinical
note annotation of data elements, and comprehensively compares CLEAN with the
widely-used annotation system Brat Rapid Annotation Tool (BRAT).
  Materials and Methods. CLEAN includes an ensemble pipeline (CLEAN-EP) with a
newly developed annotation tool (CLEAN-AT). A domain expert and a novice
user/annotator participated in a comparative usability test by tagging 87 data
elements related to Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) and Kawasaki Disease (KD)
cohorts in 84 public notes.
  Results. CLEAN achieved higher note-level F1-score (0.896) over BRAT (0.820),
with significant difference in correctness (P-value < 0.001), and the mostly
related factor being system/software (P-value < 0.001). No significant
difference (P-value 0.188) in annotation time was observed between CLEAN (7.262
minutes/note) and BRAT (8.286 minutes/note). The difference was mostly
associated with note length (P-value < 0.001) and system/software (P-value
0.013). The expert reported CLEAN to be useful/satisfactory, while the novice
reported slight improvements.
  Discussion. CLEAN improves the correctness of annotation and increases
usefulness/satisfaction with the same level of efficiency. Limitations include
untested impact of pre-annotation correctness rate, small sample size, small
user size, and restrictedly validated gold standard.
  Conclusion. CLEAN with pre-annotation can be beneficial for an expert to deal
with complex annotation tasks involving numerous and diverse target data
elements.

shell was considered by two different groups, with apparently discordant
conclusions, although both had concluded that a region of negative entropy
existed for sufficiently weak coupling. We had found that the entropy contained
an infrared divergence, which we argued should be discarded on physical
grounds. On the contrary, Bordag and Kirsten recently found a completely finite
self-entropy, although they, in fact, have to remove an infrared divergence.
Apart from this, the high- and low-temperature results for finite coupling
agree precisely for the transverse electric mode, but there are significant
discrepancies in the transverse magnetic mode. We resolve those discrepancies
here. In particular, it is shown that coupling-independent terms do not occur
in a consistent regulated calculation, they likely being an artefact of the
omission of pole terms. The results of our previous analysis, especially, the
existence of a negative entropy region for sufficiently weak coupling, are
therefore confirmed. Finally, we offer some analogous remarks concerning the
Casimir entropy of a thin electromagnetic sheet, where the total entropy is
always positive. In that case, the origin of the analogous discrepancy can be
explicitly isolated.

source and target domains in a two-player minimax game. Existing domain
adversarial networks generally assume identical label space across different
domains. In the presence of big data, there is strong motivation of
transferring deep models from existing big domains to unknown small domains.
This paper introduces partial domain adaptation as a new domain adaptation
scenario, which relaxes the fully shared label space assumption to that the
source label space subsumes the target label space. Previous methods typically
match the whole source domain to the target domain, which are vulnerable to
negative transfer for the partial domain adaptation problem due to the large
mismatch between label spaces. We present Partial Adversarial Domain Adaptation
(PADA), which simultaneously alleviates negative transfer by down-weighing the
data of outlier source classes for training both source classifier and domain
adversary, and promotes positive transfer by matching the feature distributions

influential on the actuation response of the system and thus reduce the
dimensionality of the problem. Subsequently, uncertainty quantification (UQ) of
the influential parameters was carried out through Bayesian Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC). The assessed uncertainties in the model parameters were then
propagated to the transformation strain-temperature hysteresis curves (the
model output) using first an approximate approach based on the
variance-covariance matrix of the MCMC-calibrated model parameters and then an
explicit propagation of uncertainty through MCMC-based sampling. Results show
good agreement between model and experimental hysteresis loops after
probabilistic MCMC calibration such that the experimental data are situated
within 95% Bayesian confidence intervals. The application of the MCMC-based

well as with the same set of resources (overlapping case). In both cases, the
underlying optimization problems are non-convex. In the former case, we propose
alternating optimization (AO) techniques that employ semidefinite programming

challenging. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate a device concept
based on nonlocal acousto-optic light scattering to produce nonreciprocal
single-sideband modulation and mode conversion in an integrated silicon
photonic platform. In this process, a traveling-wave acoustic phonon driven via
optical forces in a silicon waveguide is used to modulate light in a spatially
separate waveguide through a linear inter-band Brillouin scattering process. We
demonstrate up to 38 dB of nonreciprocity with 37 dB of single-sideband
suppression. In contrast to prior Brillouin- and optomechanics-based schemes
for nonreciprocity, the bandwidth of this scattering process is set through
optical phase-matching, not acoustic or optical resonances. As a result,
record-large bandwidths in excess of 125 GHz are realized, with potential for
significant further improvement through optical dispersion engineering.
Tunability of the nonreciprocal modulator operation wavelength over a 35 nm

involves both fixed and variable costs. The FCNF problem is modeled mixed
binary linear programs and can be solved with standard commercial solvers,
which use branch and bound algorithm. This problem is important for its widely
applications and solving challenges. There does not exist a efficient algorithm
to solve this problem optimally due to lacking tight bounds. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that employs statistical learning technique
to analyze the optimal flow of the FCNF problem. Most algorithms developed to
solve the FCNF problem are based on the cost structure, relaxation, etc. We
start from the network characteristics and explore the relationship between
properties of nodes, arcs and networks and the optimal flow. This is a
bi-direction approach and the findings can be used to locate the features that
affect the optimal flow most significantly, predict the optimal arcs and
provide information to solve the FCNF problem. In particular, we define 33
features based on the network characteristics, from which using step wise
regression, we identify 26 statistical significant predictors for logistic
regression to predict which arcs will have positive flow in the optimal
solutions. The predictive model achieves 88% accuracy and the area under
receiver operating characteristic curve is 0.95. Two applications are
investigated. Firstly, the predictive results can be used directly as component
critical index. The failure of arcs with higher critical index result in more
cost increase over the entire network.
