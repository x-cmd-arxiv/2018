In this paper, we review theoretical results, which are relevant for their
application to data from counting experiments. Using a simple example, we
illustrate the well known fact that commonly used variants of the least-squares
fit applied to Poisson-distributed data produce biased estimates. The bias can
be overcome with an iterated weighted least-squares method, which produces
results identical to the maximum-likelihood method. For linear models, the
iterated weighted least-squares method converges faster than the equivalent
maximum-likelihood method, and does not require problem-specific starting
values, which may be a practical advantage. The equivalence of both methods
also holds for binomially distributed data. We further show that the unbinned
maximum-likelihood method can be derived as a limiting case of the iterated
least-squares fit when the bin width goes to zero, which demonstrates a deep
connection between the two methods.

We identify clusters of sunspots of same polarity, and used these clusters to
form ``bipole pairs''. The orientation of these bipole pairs was used to
measure their tilts. We find that the latitudinal profile of tilts does not
monotonically increase with latitude as most previous studies assumed, but
instead, it shows a clear maximum at about 25--30 degree latitudes. Functional
dependence of tilt ($\gamma$) on latitude ($\varphi$) was found to be $\gamma =
(0.20\pm 0.08) \sin (2.80 \varphi) + (-0.00\pm 0.06)$. We also find that
latitudinal dependence of tilts varies from one solar cycle to another, but
larger tilts do not seem to result in stronger solar cycles. Finally, we find
the presence of a systematic offset in tilt of active regions (non-zero tilts
at the equator), with odd cycles exhibiting negative offset and even cycles
showing the positive offset.

strong constraints from direct detection and dilepton production, it is highly
convenient that the $Z'$ has axial coupling to DM and leptophobic couplings to
the SM particles, respectively. In this paper we first explore the conditions
for an anomaly-free leptophobic $Z'$, which (if flavour-blind) has to coincide
with that from gauged baryon-number in the SM sector. Then there are very few
possibilities where, besides leptophobia, the coupling to DM is axial; namely
four (quite similar) cases if the content of the dark sector is minimal. The
resulting scenario is very predictive, and perfectly viable from the present
constraints from DM detection, EW observables and LHC data (di-lepton, di-jet

allowed areas in the parameter space, which generically prefer $m_{Z'}\lesssim

representative of a class of two-dimensional lattice statistical mechanics
models that exhibit a phase separation known as the arctic curve phenomenon. In
the thermodynamic limit, the degrees of freedom are completely frozen in a
region near the boundary, while they are critically fluctuating in a central
region. The arctic curve is the phase boundary that separates those two
regions. Critical fluctuations inside the arctic curve have been studied
extensively, both in physics and in mathematics, in free models (i.e., models
that map to free fermions, or equivalently to determinantal point processes).
Here we study those critical fluctuations in the interacting (i.e., not free,
not determinantal) six-vertex model, and provide evidence for the following two
claims:
  (i) the critical fluctuations are given by a Gaussian Free Field (GFF), as in
the free case, but
  (ii) contrarily to the free case, the GFF is inhomogeneous, meaning that its
coupling constant $K$ becomes position-dependent, $K \rightarrow K({\rm x})$.
  The evidence is mainly based on the numerical solution of appropriate Bethe
ansatz equations with an imaginary extensive twist, and on transfer matrix
computations, but the second claim is also supported by the analytic
calculation of $K$ and its first two derivatives in selected points. Contrarily
to the usual GFF, this inhomogeneous GFF is not defined in terms of the Green's
function of the Laplacian $\Delta = \nabla \cdot \nabla$ inside the critical
domain, but instead, of the Green's function of a generalized Laplacian $\Delta
= \nabla \cdot \frac{1}{K} \nabla$ parametrized by the function $K$.

super-resolution have emerged, and we currently have models that successfully
generate near-photorealistic high-resolution images from their low-resolution
observations. Up to now, however, such approaches have been exclusively limited
to single image super-resolution. The application of perceptual loss functions
on video processing still entails several challenges, mostly related to the
lack of temporal consistency of the generated images, i.e., flickering
artifacts. In this work, we present a novel adversarial recurrent network for
video upscaling that is able to produce realistic textures in a temporally
consistent way. The proposed architecture naturally leverages information from
previous frames due to its recurrent architecture, i.e. the input to the
generator is composed of the low-resolution image and, additionally, the warped
output of the network at the previous step. Together with a video
discriminator, we also propose additional loss functions to further reinforce
temporal consistency in the generated sequences. The experimental validation of
our algorithm shows the effectiveness of our approach which obtains images with
high perceptual quality and improved temporal consistency.

can be reproduced by specific chemical compositions for interstellar dust at

feature of modern microprocessors, to allow the exfiltration of sensitive data
across protection boundaries. In this paper, we introduce a new Spectre-class
attack that we call SpectreRSB. In particular, rather than exploiting the
branch predictor unit, SpectreRSB exploits the return stack buffer (RSB), a
common predictor structure in modern CPUs used to predict return addresses. We
show that both local attacks (within the same process such as Spectre 1) and
attacks on SGX are possible by constructing proof of concept attacks. We also
analyze additional types of the attack on the kernel or across address spaces
and show that under some practical and widely used conditions they are
possible. Importantly, none of the known defenses including Retpoline and
Intel's microcode patches stop all SpectreRSB attacks. We believe that future
system developers should be aware of this vulnerability and consider it in
developing defenses against speculation attacks. In particular, on Core-i7
Skylake and newer processors (but not on Intel's Xeon processor line), a patch
called RSB refilling is used to address a vulnerability when the RSB
underfills; this defense interferes with SpectreRSB's ability to launch attacks
that switch into the kernel. We recommend that this patch should be used on all
machines to protect against SpectreRSB.

posed as a maximum-weighted matching of a bipartite graph, the solution of
which using the blossom algorithm allows each robot to autonomously identify
the optimal sequence of tasks it should undertake. The graph weights are
determined based on a soft clustering process, which also plays a problem
decomposition role seeking to reduce the complexity of the individual-agents'
task assignment problems. To evaluate the new Dec-MATA algorithm, a series of
case studies (of varying complexity) are performed, with tasks being
distributed randomly over an observable 2D environment. A centralized approach,
based on a state-of-the-art MILP formulation of the multi-Traveling Salesman
problem is used for comparative analysis. While getting within 7-28% of the
optimal cost obtained by the centralized algorithm, the Dec-MATA algorithm is
found to be 1-3 orders of magnitude faster and minimally sensitive to
task-to-robot ratios, unlike the centralized algorithm.

stable magnetized $\Gamma = 4/3$ polytropes uniformly rotating at the
mass-shedding limit to model the direct collapse of SMSs. These configurations
are supported entirely by thermal radiation pressure and model SMSs with $M
\gtrsim 10^{6}M_\odot$. We found that around $90\%$ of the initial stellar mass
forms a spinning black hole (BH) surrounded by a massive, hot, magnetized
torus, which eventually launches an incipient jet. Here we perform GRMHD
simulations of $\Gamma \gtrsim 4/3$, polytropes to account for the perturbative
role of gas pressure in SMSs with $M \lesssim 10^{6}M_\odot$. We also consider
different initial stellar rotation profiles. The stars are initially seeded
with a dynamically weak dipole magnetic field that is either confined to the
stellar interior or extended from its interior into the stellar exterior. We
find that the mass of the BH remnant is $90\%-99\%$ of the initial stellar
mass, depending sharply on $\Gamma -4/3$ as well as on the initial stellar
rotation profile. After $t\sim 250-550M\approx 1-2\times 10^3(M/10^6M_\odot)$s
following the BH formation, a jet is launched and it lasts for $\sim
10^4-10^5(M/10^6M_\odot)$s, consistent with the duration of long gamma-ray
bursts. Our results suggest that the Blandford-Znajek mechanism powers the jet.
They are also in agreement with our proposed universal model that estimates
accretion rates and luminosities that characterize magnetized BH-disk remnant
systems that launch a jet. This model helps explain why the outgoing
luminosities for vastly different BH-disk formation scenarios all reside within
a narrow range ($\sim 10^{52 \pm 1} \rm erg/s$), roughly independent of $M$.

and cold-dense phases. Here we present high-resolution idealised simulations of
the interaction of a hot supersonic wind with a cold cloud with the moving-mesh

cooling causes clouds with sizes larger than the cooling length to fragment in
two- and three-dimensional simulations (2D and 3D). We confirm earlier 2D

processes of 3D clouds that are exposed to a hot wind. The fragmentation
process is quantified with a friends-of-friends analysis of shattered cloudlets
and density power spectra. Those show that radiative cooling causes the power
spectral index to gradually increase when the initial cloud radius is larger
than the cooling length and with increasing time until the cloud is fully
dissolved in the hot wind. A resolution of around 1 pc is required to reveal
the effect of cooling-induced fragmentation of a 100 pc outflowing cloud. Thus,

production of dark matter in association with a Standard Model (SM) particle.
The simplest benchmark introduces a massive spin-1 mediator, the $Z^\prime$
boson, between the dark matter $\chi$ and the SM. Limits derived from mono-X
channels are most effective when the mediator can decay into two on-shell dark
matter particles: $M_{Z'}\gtrsim 2M_\chi$. We broaden the experimental reach
into the complementary region, where the $Z^\prime$ mediator is much lighter
than the dark matter. In this scenario the $Z^\prime$ mediates an effective
long-range force between the dark matter, thereby facilitating the formation of
darkonium bound states, as is common in many dark sector models. The darkonium
becomes active when $M_{\chi}>M_{Z'}/\alpha_{\rm eff}$, where $\alpha_{\rm
eff}$ is the effective fine-structure constant in the dark sector. Moreover,
the darkonium could decay back into SM quarks, without producing missing
transverse momentum in the detector. Considering multijet final states, we
reinterpret existing searches to constrain the simple $Z^\prime$ benchmark
beyond the region probed by mono-X searches. Assuming a baryonic $Z^\prime$
mediator and a Dirac dark matter, direct detection bounds can be loosened by
giving a small Majorana mass to the dark matter. We also consider the interplay
between mono-X and darkonium channels at future high energy colliders, which is
at the frontier of probing the model parameter space.

Kepler observations have revealed a class of short period
exoplanets, of which Kepler-1520 b is the prototype, which have comet-like dust
tails thought to be the result of small, rocky planets losing mass. The shape
and chromaticity of the transits constrain the properties of the dust particles
originating from the planet's surface, offering a unique opportunity to probe
the composition and geophysics of rocky exoplanets.
  Aims. We aim to approximate the average Kepler long-cadence light curve of
Kepler-1520 b and investigate how the optical thickness and transit
cross-section of a general dust tail can affect the observed wavelength
dependence and depth of transit light curves.
  Methods. We developed a new 3D model that ejects sublimating particles from
the planet surface to build up a dust tail, assuming it to be optically thin,
and used 3D radiative transfer computations that fully treat scattering using
the distribution of hollow spheres (DHS) method, to generate transit light
curves between 0.45 and 2.5 $\mu$m.
  Results. We show that the transit depth is wavelength independent for
optically thick tails, potentially explaining why only some observations
indicate a wavelength dependence. From the 3D nature of our simulated tails, we
show that their transit cross-sections are related to the component of particle
ejection velocity perpendicular to the planet's orbital plane and use this to
derive a minimum ejection velocity of 1.2 kms$^{-1}$. To fit the average
transit depth of Kepler-1520 b of 0.87%, we require a high dust mas-loss rate
of 7 $-$ 80 M$_\oplus$ Gyr$^{-1}$ which implies planet lifetimes that may be
inconsistent with the observed sample. Therefore, these mass-loss rates should
be considered to be upper limits.

pure quantum systems by utilizing a surrounding heat-bath and unitary
interactions. These techniques originally used the thermal environment only to
fully thermalize ancillas at the environment temperature. Here we extend HBAC
protocols by optimizing over the thermalization strategy. We find, for any
$d$-dimensional system in an arbitrary initial state, provably optimal cooling
protocols with surprisingly simple structure and exponential convergence to the
ground state. Compared to the standard ones, these schemes can use fewer or no
ancillas and exploit memory effects to enhance cooling. We verify that the
optimal protocols are robusts to various deviations from the ideal scenario.
For a single target qubit, the optimal protocol can be well approximated with a
Jaynes-Cummings interaction between the system and a single thermal bosonic
mode for a wide range of environmental temperatures. This admits an
experimental implementation close to the setup of a micromaser, with a
performance competitive with leading proposals in the literature. The proposed
protocol provides an experimental setup that illustrates how non-Markovianity
can be harnessed to improve cooling. On the technical side we 1. introduce a
new class of states called maximally active states and discuss their
thermodynamic significance in terms of optimal unitary control, 2. introduce a
new set of thermodynamic processes, called $\beta$-permutations, whose access
is sufficient to simulate a generic thermalization process, 3. show how to use

thermodynamics to perform challenging optimizations, while combining it with

for assessing the overall or ""holistic"" performance of nascent quantum
processors. The current industry standard is Clifford randomized benchmarking
(RB), which measures a single error rate that quantifies overall performance.
But scaling Clifford RB to many qubits is surprisingly hard. It has only been
performed on 1, 2, and 3 qubits as of this writing. This reflects a fundamental
inefficiency in Clifford RB: the $n$-qubit Clifford gates at its core have to
be compiled into large circuits over the 1- and 2-qubit gates native to a
device. As $n$ grows, the quality of these Clifford gates quickly degrades,
making Clifford RB impractical at relatively low $n$. In this Letter, we
propose a direct RB protocol that mostly avoids compiling. Instead, it uses
random circuits over the native gates in a device, seeded by an initial layer
of Clifford-like randomization. We demonstrate this protocol experimentally on
2 -- 5 qubits, using the publicly available IBMQX5. We believe this to be the
greatest number of qubits holistically benchmarked, and this was achieved on a
freely available device without any special tuning up. Our protocol retains the
simplicity and convenient properties of Clifford RB: it estimates an error rate
from an exponential decay. But it can be extended to processors with more
qubits -- we present simulations on 10+ qubits -- and it reports a more
directly informative and flexible error rate than the one reported by Clifford
RB. We show how to use this flexibility to measure separate error rates for
distinct sets of gates, which includes tasks such as measuring an average CNOT
error rate.

systems use a fixed/user-prescribed network topology, leading to sub-optimal
performance and low portability. The existing neuro-evolution of augmenting
topology or NEAT paradigm offers a powerful alternative by allowing the network
topology and the connection weights to be simultaneously optimized through an
evolutionary process. However, most NEAT implementations allow the
consideration of only a single objective. There also persists the question of
how to tractably introduce topological diversification that mitigates
overfitting to training scenarios. To address these gaps, this paper develops a
multi-objective neuro-evolution algorithm. While adopting the basic elements of
NEAT, important modifications are made to the selection, speciation, and
mutation processes. With the backdrop of small-robot path-planning

we study the effect of triplet pairing on the purity of photons produced
through Cooper pair recombination. A unique directional dependence of the state

entangled photons are produced when the photon polarization axis is parallel to

degrade the state purity, while induced singlet pairing in a triplet

of a quantum particle diffusing in a harmonic potential and linearly coupled to
a harmonic bath. The results are valid for arbitrary strength and spectral
density of the coupling. The general, exact non-Markovian result is expressed
in terms of the classical velocity autocorrelation function, which represents
an accumulated phase during a scattering event. The imaginary part of the
exponent of the ISF is proportional to the accumulated phase, which is an
antisymmetric function of the correlation time $t$. The expressions extend
previous results given in the quantum Langevin framework where the classical
response of the bath was taken as Markovian. For a special case of
non-Markovian friction, where the friction kernel decays exponentially in time
rather than instantaneously, we provide exact results relating to unconfined
quantum diffusion, and identify general features that allow insight to be
exported to more complex examples. The accumulated phase as a function of the t
has a universal gradient at the origin, depending only on the mass of the
diffusing system particle. At large t the accumulated phase reaches a constant
limit that depends only on the classical diffusion coefficient and is therefore
independent of the detailed memory properties of the friction kernel.
Non-Markovian properties of the friction kernel are encoded in the details of
how the accumulated phase switches from its $t\rightarrow -\infty$ to its
$t\rightarrow -\infty$ limit, subject to the constraint of the universal
gradient. When memory effects are significant, the transition from one limit to
the other becomes non-monotonic, owing to oscillations in the classical
velocity autocorrelation. The result is interpreted in terms of a solvent
caging effect, in which slowly fluctuating bath modes create transient wells
for the system particle.

Surface Models (DSMs) are a two-stage approach for estimating spatially-varying
density from distance-sampling data. First, detection probabilities -- perhaps
depending on covariates -- are estimated based on details of individual
encounters; next, local densities are estimated using a GAM, by fitting local
encounter rates to location and/or spatially-varying covariates while allowing
for the estimated detectabilities. One criticism of DSMs has been that
uncertainty from the two stages is not usually propagated correctly into the
final variance estimates. We show how to reformulate a DSM so that the
uncertainty in detection probability from the distance sampling stage
(regardless of its complexity) is captured as an extra random effect in the GAM
stage. In effect, we refit an approximation to the detection function model at
the same time as fitting the spatial model. This allows straightforward
computation of the overall variance via exactly the same software already
needed to fit the GAM. A further extension allows for spatial variation in
group size, which can be an important covariate for detectability as well as
directly affecting abundance. We illustrate these models using point transect

  Vector and Recurrent Neural Networks","ACM KDD 2018 Deep Learning Day",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) learning has recently been used for
abstractive and extractive summarization. In current study, Seq2Seq models have
been used for eBay product description summarization. We propose a novel
Document-Context based Seq2Seq models using RNNs for abstractive and extractive
summarizations. Intuitively, this is similar to humans reading the title,
abstract or any other contextual information before reading the document. This
gives humans a high-level idea of what the document is about. We use this idea
and propose that Seq2Seq models should be started with contextual information
at the first time-step of the input to obtain better summaries. In this manner,
the output summaries are more document centric, than being generic, overcoming
one of the major hurdles of using generative models. We generate
document-context from user-behavior and seller provided information. We train
and evaluate our models on human-extracted-golden-summaries. The
document-contextual Seq2Seq models outperform standard Seq2Seq models.
Moreover, generating human extracted summaries is prohibitively expensive to
scale, we therefore propose a semi-supervised technique for extracting
approximate summaries and using it for training Seq2Seq models at scale.
Semi-supervised models are evaluated against human extracted summaries and are
found to be of similar efficacy. We provide side by side comparison for
abstractive and extractive summarizers (contextual and non-contextual) on same
evaluation dataset. Overall, we provide methodologies to use and evaluate the
proposed techniques for large document summarization. Furthermore, we found
these techniques to be highly effective, which is not the case with existing
techniques.

within macroscopic objects, and provides improved material contrast compared to
the conventional transmission-based computed tomography (CT). However, due to
the small diffraction cross-section, XDT suffers from long imaging acquisition
time, which could take tens of hours for a full scan using a table-top X-ray
tube. In medical and industrial imaging applications, oftentimes only the XRD
measurement within a region-of-interest (ROI) is required, which, together with
the demand to reduce imaging time and radiation dose to the sample, motivates
the development of interior XDT systems that scan and reconstruct only an
internal region within the sample. The interior problem does not have a unique
solution, and a direct inversion on the truncated projection data often leads
to large reconstruction errors in ROI. To reduce the truncation artifacts,
conventional attenuation-based interior reconstruction problems rely on a known
region or piecewise constant constraint within the ROI, which do not apply to
all the samples in XDT. Here we propose a quasi-interior XDT scheme that
incorporates a small fraction of projection information from the exterior
region to assist interior reconstruction. The low-resolution exterior
projection data obviates the requirement for prior knowledge on the object, and
allows the ROI reconstruction to be performed with the fast, widely-used
filtered back-projection algorithm for easy integration into real-time XDT
imaging modules.

The total weighted overlap of all jobs is to be maximized. This problem is key
to subcontractor scheduling in extended enterprises and supply chains, and
divisible load scheduling in computing. We prove that, quite surprisingly,
$\textit{synchronized}$ schedules that complete each job using shared

optimal schedules. We show that optimal $\alpha$-$\textit{private}$ schedules
that require each job to use its private processor for at least

phonon modes). Additionally, its accuracy suffers from the absence of
higher-than-third-order phonon scattering processes, which are important
near/above the Debye temperature. In this letter, we present an effective
scheme that combines temperature-induced anharmonic phonon renormalization and
four-phonon scattering to resolve these two theoretical challenges. We apply
this scheme to investigate the lattice dynamics and thermal transport
properties of GeTe, which undergoes a second-order ferroelectric phase
transition from rhombohedral $\alpha$-GeTe to rocksalt $\beta$-GeTe at about

explore the possibility to further suppress $\kappa_{l}$, we show that alloying

high-level coarse-graining (CG) method for polymer melts, with variable
resolution from soft spheres to multi CG sites, which preserves the structural
and thermodynamical consistencies with the related atomistic simulations. When
compared to the atomistic description, the procedure of coarse-graining results
in smoother free energy surfaces, longer-ranged potentials, a decrease in the
number of interaction sites for a given polymer, and more. Because these
changes have competing effects on the computational efficiency of the CG model,
care needs to be taken when studying the effect of coarse-graining on the
computational speed-up in CG molecular dynamics simulations. For instance,
treatment of long-range CG interactions requires the selection of cutoff
distances that include the attractive part of the effective CG potential and
force. In particular, we show how the complex nature of the range and curvature
of the effective CG potential, the selection of a suitable CG timestep, the
choice of the cutoff distance, the molecular dynamics algorithms, and the
smoothness of the CG free energy surface affect the efficiency of IECG
simulations. By direct comparison with the atomistic simulations of relatively
short chain polymer melts, we find that the overall computational efficiency is
highest for the highest level of CG (soft spheres), with an overall improvement
of the computational efficiency being about $10^6-10^8$ for various CG
levels/resolutions. Therefore, the IECG method can have important applications
in molecular dynamics simulations of polymeric systems. Finally, making use of
the standard spatial decomposition algorithm, the parallel scalability of the
IECG simulations for various levels of CG is presented. Optimal parallel
scaling is observed for a reasonably large number of processors.

in a range of fields, from physics to neuroscience to finance. Estimating
information accurately over a wide range of conditions relies on the
development of flexible methods to describe statistical dependencies among
variables, without imposing potentially invalid assumptions on the data. Such
methods are needed in cases that lack prior knowledge of their statistical
properties and that have limited sample numbers. Here we propose a powerful and
generally applicable information estimator based on non-parametric copulas.
This estimator, called the non-parametric copula-based estimator (NPC), is
tailored to take into account detailed stochastic relationships in the data
independently of the data's marginal distributions. The NPC estimator can be
used both for continuous and discrete numerical variables and thus provides a
single framework for the mutual information estimation of both continuous and
discrete data. By extensive validation on artificial samples drawn from various
statistical distributions, we found that the NPC estimator compares well
against commonly used alternatives. Unlike methods not based on copulas, it
allows an estimation of information that is robust to changes of the details of
the marginal distributions. Unlike parametric copula methods, it remains
accurate regardless of the precise form of the interactions between the
variables. In addition, the NPC estimator had accurate information estimates
even at low sample numbers, in comparison to alternative estimators. The NPC
estimator therefore provides a good balance between general applicability to
arbitrarily shaped statistical dependencies in the data and shows accurate and
robust performance when working with small sample sizes.

trajectories are utilized as desired outputs to synthesize a control Lyapunov
function based quadratic program (CLF-QP). Centroidal angular momentum, taking
as an addition output in the CLF-QP, is also stabilized in the jumping phase to
prevent whole body rotation in the underactuated flight phase. The solution to
the CLF-QP is a nonlinear feedback control law that achieves dynamic jumping
behaviors on bipedal robots with compliance. The framework presented in this
paper is verified experimentally on the bipedal robot Cassie.

additive random effects model originally developed for continuous dyadic data.
Third-order patterns can be represented with multiplicative random effects

can be viewed as the true label when evaluating against other existing methods.
Overall, our proposed framework Phylogenetic Graphical Lasso (PGLasso)
outperforms existing methods with gains larger than 100% in terms of Adjusted

gravity regime of coalescing binaries, where gravity is strong, dynamical and
non-linear. The interpretation of these observations relies on the comparison
of the data to a gravitational wave model, which in turn depends on the orbital
evolution of the binary, and in particular on its orbital energy and angular
momentum decay. In this paper, we calculate the latter in the inspiral of a
non-spinning compact binary system within Einstein-\AE{}ther theory. From the
theory's gravitational wave stress energy tensor and a balance law, we compute
the angular momentum decay both as a function of the fields in the theory and
as a function of the multipole moments of the binary. We then specialize to a
Keplerian parameterization of the orbit to express the angular momentum decay
as a function of the binary's orbital elements. We conclude by combining this
with the orbital energy decay to find expressions for the decay of the
semi-major axis and the orbital eccentricity of the binary. We find that these
rates of decay are typically faster in Einstein-\AE{}ther theory than in
General Relativity due to the presence of dipole radiation. Such modifications
will imprint onto the chirp rate of gravitational waves, leaving a signature of
Einstein-\AE{}ther theory that if absent in the data could be used to

pairs from the vacuum due to a quasiconstant electric field
$E_{\mathrm{strong}}$. The pair-creation yield can be exponentially enhanced
without destroying the tunneling-like nature of this mechanism by adding a
weaker temporal Sauter pulse $E_{\mathrm{weak}}/\cosh^{2}(\omega t)$ with
$\omega$ above a certain threshold $\omega_{\mathrm{crit}}$. In this original
form of the so-called dynamically assisted Sauter--Schwinger effect,
$\omega_{\mathrm{crit}}$ is independent of $E_{\mathrm{weak}}\ll
E_{\mathrm{strong}}$. Via the semiclassical solution (contour integral) of the
Riccati equation in 1+1 spacetime dimensions, we find that a Gaussian-shaped
pulse $E_{\mathrm{weak}}\exp[-(\omega t)^{2}]$ assists tunneling in a similar
way but with $\omega_{\mathrm{crit}}$ depending on $E_{\mathrm{weak}}$. This
remarkable sensitivity to the pulse shape arises due to the different pole
structures of the vector potentials for complex times. We also study dynamical
assistance by an oscillation $E_{\mathrm{weak}}\cos(\omega t)$ as a model for
counterpropagating laser beams and find another dependence
$\omega_{\mathrm{crit}}(E_{\mathrm{weak}})$.
  The largeness of the Schwinger limit $E_{\mathrm{crit}}^{\mathrm{QED}}\approx

understanding of this effect and its dynamical assistance via experiments, we
propose an analog of the many-body Dirac Hamiltonian in direct-bandgap

the valence and conduction bands in reciprocal space, which correspond to the
two relativistic energy continua. Similar models have been considered

increasingly becoming the underpinning technology for major industries. A major
concern regarding such systems are the seemingly unexpected large-scale
failures, which are often attributed to a small initial shock getting escalated
due to intricate dependencies within and across the individual counterparts of
the system. In this paper, we develop a novel interdependent system model to
capture this phenomenon, also known as cascading failures. Our framework
consists of two networks that have inherently different characteristics
governing their intra-dependency: i) a cyber-network where a node is functional
as long as it belongs to the largest connected (i.e., giant) component; and ii)
a physical network where nodes are given an initial flow and a capacity, and
failure of a node results with redistribution of its flow to the remaining
nodes, upon which further failures might take place due to overloading (i.e.,
the flow of a node exceeding its capacity). Furthermore, it is assumed that
these two networks are inter-dependent. For simplicity, we consider a
one-to-one interdependency model where every node in the cyber-network is
dependent upon and supports a single node in the physical network, and vice
versa. We provide a thorough analysis of the dynamics of cascading failures in
this interdependent system initiated with a random attack. The system
robustness is quantified as the surviving fraction of nodes at the end of
cascading failures, and is derived in terms of all network parameters involved
(e.g., degree distribution, load/capacity distribution, failure size, etc.).
Analytic results are supported through an extensive numerical study. Among
other things, these results demonstrate the ability of our model to capture the
unexpected nature of large-scale failures and provide insights on improving
system robustness.

grafted on to the surface of an impermeable substrate. They arise due to the
competition between conformational entropic elasticity of polymer chains and
excluded volume interactions from the intra and interchain monomer repulsions.
Recently, stimuli responsive polymer brush based soft materials have been
developed to produce controllable and reversible large deformations of the host
substrate. To understand these systems, and improve their functional
properties, we study elastic stress distribution and surface stress-curvature
relations of a neutral polymer brush grafted on to an elastic beam, made of a
soft material. In the strongly stretched brush regime, we combine mean field
theory from polymer physics with a continuum mechanics model and show that the
residual stress variation is a quartic function of distance from the grafting
surface, with maximum stress occurring at the grafted surface. Idealizing the
brush as a continuum elastic surface layer with residual stress, we derive a
closed form expression for surface stress and the surface elasticity of the
layer as a function of brush parameters, such as graft density and molecular
weight. The generalized continuum beam model accounts for the Young-Laplace and
Ogden-Steigman curvature elasticity correction terms, and yields a surface
stress-curvature relation, which contains existing relations in the literature
as special cases. Further, we report experiments on a thermoresponsive random
copolymer brush, Poly(N- isopropylacrylamide)-co-Poly(N,N-Dimethylacrylamide)
(PNIPAm-co-PDMA) brush, grafted on one side of a plasticized pPVC thin film.
Estimated surface stress from measured curvature is on the order of $-10~N/m$,

each base station (BS) first estimates the channels to intra-cell users using
either minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) or element-wise MMSE (EW-MMSE)
estimation based on uplink pilots. The estimates are used for local decoding on
each BS followed by a second decoding layer where the BSs cooperate to mitigate
inter-cell interference. An uplink achievable spectral efficiency (SE)
expression is computed for arbitrary two-layer decoding schemes. A closed-form
expression is then obtained for correlated Rayleigh fading, maximum-ratio
combining, and the proposed large-scale fading decoding (LSFD) in the second
layer. We also formulate a sum SE maximization problem with both the data power

we develop a low-complexity algorithm based on the weighted MMSE approach to

acceleration is often considered as an inherent negative feature of the
mechanism. The divergence however arises primarily because the standard
approach relies on transverse electron oscillations and their interplay with
the transverse electric fields of the laser pulse. We propose a conceptually
different approach to direct laser acceleration that leverages longitudinal
laser electric fields that are present in a tightly focused laser beam. A
structured hollow-core target is used to enhance the longitudinal fields and
maintain them over a distance much longer than the Rayleigh length by guiding
the laser pulse. Electrons are injected by the transverse laser electric field
into the channel and then they are accelerated forward by the pulse, creating
an electron current. The forces from electric and magnetic fields of this
electron population compensate each other, creating a favorable configuration
without a strong restoring force. We use two-dimensional particle-in-cell
simulations to demonstrate that a low divergence energetic electron beam with
an opening angle of less than 5$^\circ$ can be generated in this configuration.
Most of the energy is transferred to the electrons by the longitudinal laser
electric field and, given a sufficient acceleration distance,
super-ponderomotive energies can be realized without sacrificing the
collimation.

indexing, clustering, classification, and approximation algorithms in general.
Due to measurement error, noise, or an inability to completely gather all the
data, a collection of distances may not satisfy the basic metric requirements,
most notably the triangle inequality. Thus last year the authors introduced the
Metric Violation Distance (MVD) problem, where the input is an undirected and
positively-weighted complete graph, and the goal is to identify a minimum
cardinality subset of edges whose weights can be modified such that the
resulting graph is its own metric completion. This problem was shown to be
APX-hard, and moreover an $O(OPT^{1/3})$-approximation was shown, where $OPT$
is the size of the optimal solution.
  In this paper we introduce the Generalized Metric Violation Distance (GMVD)
problem, where the goal is the same, but the input graph is no longer required
to be complete. For GMVD we prove stronger hardness results, and provide a
significantly faster approximation algorithm with an improved approximation
guarantee. In particular, we give an approximation-preserving reduction from
the well studied MultiCut problem, which is hard to approximate within any
constant factor assuming the Unique Games Conjecture. Our approximation factor
depends on deficit values, which for a given cycle is the largest single edge
weight minus the sum of the weights of all its other edges. Note that no cycle
has positive deficit in a metric complete graph. We give an $O(c \log
n)$-approximation algorithm for \gmvd, where $c$ is the number of distinct
positive cycle deficit values in the input graph.

perform phonetic-and-semantic embedding on spoken words considering the context

In general, phonetic structure and semantics inevitably disturb each other. For
example the words ""brother"" and ""sister"" are close in semantics but very
different in phonetic structure, while the words ""brother"" and ""bother"" are in
the other way around. But phonetic-and-semantic embedding is attractive, as
shown in the initial experiments on spoken document retrieval. Not only spoken

fact that many bio-fluids closely follow the generalized Newtonian rheology,
the rheology of the surrounding swimming medium is considered to follow the
Carreau-Yasuda viscosity model. Further to capture the experimentally observed
effects of peroxide concentration and feedback of generated proton
concentration on the surface cation flux, we incorporate a Michaelis-Menten
like surface reaction kinetics. The electrocatalytic efficiency defined as a
ratio between the cost of swimming of an equivalent passively dragged particle
and the input chemical energy via surface reaction, is utilized to assess the
influence of the rheological parameters on the swimmer performance. The results
indicate that the shear thinning and shear thickening nature of the surrounding
fluid causes an enhancement and reduction in swimmer velocity, respectively.
However, an increase in the shear thinning effect does not always guarantee an
efficient operation of the microswimmer. A competition between the particle
velocity and reduction in the drag force on the particle, decides whether the
propulsion efficiency will have a relative augmentation or attenuation with
varying power law index. We further report the existence of maximum efficiency
points for some specific range of Weissenberg number and optimum power law
indices. Moreover the behaviour of such optimum operating conditions strongly
depends on the non-trivial and highly coupled interplay among the rheology and

magnetic field. We assume a polynomial function for the magnetic field
morphology inside the clump. We use the numerical iterative methods to solve
the equations: the successive over-relaxation method to find the magnetic and
gravitational fluxes, and then the bicongugate gradient method to find the
optimized values of mass and current densities. The results show that the IRDC
clump will be very elongated along the perpendicular direction of the external
magnetic field lines. Also, the assumption of choosing of a polynomial function
for the magnetic field morphology leads to the formation of dense regions
around the center. The greater the density of the central region, the larger
the density of these dense regions and the closer to the center. The presence
of these dense regions can lead to the formation of cores at these points.

this problem is to retrain the networks using those adversarial examples,

Therefore, it cannot alleviate the problem of black-box attacks, where

  Understanding",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Archetypal scenarios for change detection generally consider two images
acquired through sensors of the same modality. However, in some specific cases
such as emergency situations, the only images available may be those acquired
through sensors of different modalities. This paper addresses the problem of
unsupervisedly detecting changes between two observed images acquired by
sensors of different modalities with possibly different resolutions. These
sensor dissimilarities introduce additional issues in the context of
operational change detection that are not addressed by most of the classical
methods. This paper introduces a novel framework to effectively exploit the
available information by modelling the two observed images as a sparse linear
combination of atoms belonging to a pair of coupled overcomplete dictionaries
learnt from each observed image. As they cover the same geographical location,
codes are expected to be globally similar, except for possible changes in
sparse spatial locations. Thus, the change detection task is envisioned through
a dual code estimation which enforces spatial sparsity in the difference
between the estimated codes associated with each image. This problem is
formulated as an inverse problem which is iteratively solved using an efficient
proximal alternating minimization algorithm accounting for nonsmooth and
nonconvex functions. The proposed method is applied to real images with
simulated yet realistic and real changes. A comparison with state-of-the-art
change detection methods evidences the accuracy of the proposed strategy.

leveraging the procedural bias, it may select spurious features due to the
multicollinearity in high dimensional space. Moreover, it does not take into

procedural bias and lesion features differ in terms of volumetric change and
spatial correlation pattern. To address these issues, we propose a ""two-groups""

exploit the heterogenous spatial patterns of features. In addition, it enjoys

studied. Therein, the network-wide power consumption of vehicular users (VUEs)
is minimized subject to high reliability in terms of probabilistic queuing
delays. Using extreme value theory, a new reliability measure is defined to
characterize extreme events pertaining to vehicles' queue lengths exceeding a
predefined threshold. To learn these extreme events, assuming they are
independently and identically distributed over VUEs, a novel distributed
approach based on federated learning (FL) is proposed to estimate the tail
distribution of the queue lengths. Considering the communication delays
incurred by FL over wireless links, Lyapunov optimization is used to derive the
JPRA policies enabling URLLC for each VUE in a distributed manner. The proposed
solution is then validated via extensive simulations using a Manhattan mobility
model. Simulation results show that FL enables the proposed method to estimate
the tail distribution of queues with an accuracy that is close to a centralized
solution with up to 79% reductions in the amount of exchanged data.
Furthermore, the proposed method yields up to 60% reductions of VUEs with large
queue lengths, while reducing the average power consumption by two folds,
compared to an average queue-based baseline.

model with stochastic binary-state neurons in all the network topologies,
except ring lattices. Given that apart from network structure, all four models
are equivalent, this allows us to understand the role of network structure in
neuronal network dynamics. Whilst ER and RR networks are characterized by
similar phase diagrams, we find strikingly different phase diagrams in the
all-to-all network. Neuronal network dynamics is not only different within
certain parameter ranges, but it also undergoes different bifurcations (with a
richer repertoire of bifurcations in ER and RR compared to all-to-all
networks). This suggests that local heterogeneity in the ratio between
excitation and inhibition plays a crucial role on emergent dynamics.
Furthermore, we also observe one subtle discrepancy between ER and RR networks,
namely ER networks undergo a neuronal activity jump at lower noise levels
compared to RR networks, presumably due to the degree heterogeneity in ER
networks that is absent in RR networks. Finally, a comparison between network
oscillations in RR networks and ring lattices shows the importance of
small-world properties in sustaining stable network oscillations.

expected to be used in uplink grant-free transmission, multiplying connection

applied for coordinated transmissions where the base station performs

different layers based on predetermined inter-layer received power difference.
A distributed layered grant-free NOMA based hybrid transmission scheme is
proposed to reduce collision probability. Moreover, we derive the closed-form

therefore, fine structures of the electronic bands and Bloch functions are

structures in the electronic bands are often not reflected to the macroscopic
quantities. In this work, we investigate the anomaly-related magnetoresistance
in metals with type-II Weyl nodes close to the FS, and find that the
anomaly-related current increases divergently, showing a singular structure.
Detailed analysis on a simple model with multiple Weyl nodes shows that the
contribution to the magnetoresistance is dominated by the electrons in the
vicinity of the Weyl nodes; this is related to the fact that the current is
given by the square of the Berry curvature, which enhances the contribution
from the electrons around the Weyl nodes. The above results potentially allows
an estimate of the anomaly-induced current without precise information of the

$r$ satisfies the relation $r\le 0$ for $p\ge p_{\rm c}$. (2) The average

decoherence, we argue that the heat bath follows unitary time evolution only
over limited length and time scales and thus leads to localization and
stochastic dynamics of quantum particles that interact with it. We show
furthermore that a theory that describes all the steps from the initial arrival
of the quantum particle to the final pointer deflection must use elements from

it derives from the cosmological Direction of Time. Overall, our proposal is
for Contextual Wavefunction Collapse (CWC).

substantial change in the behavior of the physical attributes of the compact

been noted with the corresponding change in $\lambda$ values. Meanwhile, it has
been shown that for some fixed central energy density and with increasing
values of $\lambda$, the stellar mass both for the neutron stars and the
strange stars increases, while the total stellar radius $R$ exhibits the
opposite behavior for both of the compact stars. It is concluded that for this

and effective method for neural network compression. PFA exploits the
correlation between filter responses within network layers to recommend a
smaller network that maintain as much as possible the accuracy of the full
model. We propose two algorithms: the first allows users to target compression
to specific network property, such as number of trainable variable (footprint),
and produces a compressed model that satisfies the requested property while
preserving the maximum amount of spectral energy in the responses of each
layer, while the second is a parameter-free heuristic that selects the
compression used at each layer by trying to mimic an ideal set of uncorrelated
responses. Since PFA compresses networks based on the correlation of their
responses we show in our experiments that it gains the additional flexibility
of adapting each architecture to a specific domain while compressing. PFA is
evaluated against several architectures and datasets, and shows considerable
compression rates without compromising accuracy, e.g., for VGG-16 on CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, PFA achieves a compression rate of 8x, 3x, and 1.4x
with an accuracy gain of 0.4%, 1.4% points, and 2.4% respectively. Our tests

  (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8594568)",,"10.1109/LCA.2018.2890236",,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a widely used form of deep neural
networks, introducing state-of-the-art results for different problems such as
image classification, computer vision tasks, and speech recognition. However,
CNNs are compute intensive, requiring billions of multiply-accumulate (MAC)
operations per input. To reduce the number of MACs in CNNs, we propose a value
prediction method that exploits the spatial correlation of zero-valued
activations within the CNN output feature maps, thereby saving convolution
operations. Our method reduces the number of MAC operations by 30.4%, averaged
on three modern CNNs for ImageNet, with top-1 accuracy degradation of 1.7%, and
top-5 accuracy degradation of 1.1%.

diffraction optical elements (DOE) that are made of stacks of low-resolution
binary phase gratings, whereby the two-dimensional grids in different grating
layers are arranged with specified displacements. We remodel the common
Kinoform algorithm for this multi-scale architecture. Numerical computations
show that, by increasing the number of stacking layers, the resolution of
diffraction fields can be improved and that the stability of optical elements
within broad spectrums is significantly enhanced. Practical concern on largely
increasing the number of grating layers are efficiency of the optical designs
in theory and the manufacture of stacks of ultra-thin grating films.

  segmentation accuracy for randomly-initialized U-net",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  White matter hyperintensity (WMH) is commonly found in elder individuals and
appears to be associated with brain diseases. U-net is a convolutional network
that has been widely used for biomedical image segmentation. Recently, U-net
has been successfully applied to WMH segmentation. Random initialization is
usally used to initialize the model weights in the U-net. However, the model
may coverage to different local optima with different randomly initialized
weights. We find a combination of thresholding and averaging the outputs of
U-nets with different random initializations can largely improve the WMH
segmentation accuracy. Based on this observation, we propose a post-processing
technique concerning the way how averaging and thresholding are conducted.
Specifically, we first transfer the score maps from three U-nets to binary
masks via thresholding and then average those binary masks to obtain the final
WMH segmentation. Both quantitative analysis (via the Dice similarity
coefficient) and qualitative analysis (via visual examinations) reveal the
superior performance of the proposed method. This post-processing technique is
independent of the model used. As such, it can also be applied to situations
where other deep learning models are employed, especially when random
initialization is adopted and pre-training is unavailable.

improving public health. In this paper, we propose a daily prediction method of
PM2.5 concentration by using data-driven ordinary differential equation (ODE)
models. Specifically, based on the historical PM2.5 concentration, this method
combines genetic programming and orthogonal least square method to evolve the
ODE models, which describe the transport of PM2.5 and then uses the data-driven
ODEs to predict the air quality in the future. Experiment results show that the
ODE models obtain similar prediction results as the typical statistical model,
and the prediction results from this method are relatively good. To our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to evolve data-driven ODE models to study
PM2.5 prediction.

  Information","2018 IEEE 26th International Requirements Engineering Conference
  Workshops",,,,"cs.SE cs.CL cs.IR stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Requirements elicitation requires extensive knowledge and deep understanding
of the problem domain where the final system will be situated. However, in many
software development projects, analysts are required to elicit the requirements
from an unfamiliar domain, which often causes communication barriers between
analysts and stakeholders. In this paper, we propose a requirements ELICitation
Aid tool (ELICA) to help analysts better understand the target application
domain by dynamic extraction and labeling of requirements-relevant knowledge.
To extract the relevant terms, we leverage the flexibility and power of
Weighted Finite State Transducers (WFSTs) in dynamic modeling of natural
language processing tasks. In addition to the information conveyed through
text, ELICA captures and processes non-linguistic information about the
intention of speakers such as their confidence level, analytical tone, and
emotions. The extracted information is made available to the analysts as a set
of labeled snippets with highlighted relevant terms which can also be exported
as an artifact of the Requirements Engineering (RE) process. The application
and usefulness of ELICA are demonstrated through a case study. This study shows
how pre-existing relevant information about the application domain and the
information captured during an elicitation meeting, such as the conversation
and stakeholders' intentions, can be captured and used to support analysts
achieving their tasks.

nanocomposites. Towards this end, the study leverages the analysis of a large
bulk of fracture tests from the literature with the goal of critically
investigating the effects of the nonlinear Fracture Process Zone (FPZ). It is
shown that for most of the fracture tests the effects of the nonlinear FPZ are
not negligible, leading to significant deviations from Linear Elastic Fracture
Mechanics (LEFM) sometimes exceeding 150% depending on the specimen size and
nanofiller content. To get a deeper understanding of the characteristics of the
FPZ, fracture tests on geometrically-scaled Single Edge Notch Bending (SENB)
specimens are analyzed leveraging a cohesive zone model. It is found that the
FPZ cannot be neglected and a bi-linear cohesive crack law generally provides
the best match of experimental data.
