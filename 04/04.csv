for the conclusions of their examinations. While scholars advocate for the use
of a Bayes factor to quantify the weight of forensic evidence, it is often
impossible to assign the necessary probability measures to perform
likelihood-based inference for high-dimensional and complex data. To address
this issue, we revisit a two-stage inference framework and leverage the
properties of kernel functions to offer a method that allows for statistically
supporting the inference of the identity of source of sets of trace and control
objects by way of a single test. Our method is generic in that it can be easily
tailored to any type of data encountered in forensic science or pattern
recognition, and our method does not depend on the dimension or the type of the
considered data. The application of our method to paint evidence shows that
this type of evidence carries substantial probative value. Finally, our
approach can easily be extended to other evidence types such as glass, fibres
and dust.

paper demonstrates a novel scheme to incorporate a structured Gaussian
likelihood prediction network within the VAE that allows the residual

also propose a new mechanism for allowing structured uncertainty on color

corrections with infinite Kaluza-Klein (KK) states and evaluate Casimir vacuum
energy from extra dimensions. The extra dimensional models always involve the
infinite massless or massive Kaluza-Klein states, and therefore, the
regularization of the infinite KK corrections is highly problematic. In order
to avoid the ambiguity, we adopt the proper time integrals and the Riemann zeta
function regularization in evaluating the summations of infinite KK states. In
the calculation, we utilize the KK regularization method with exchanging the
infinite summations and the infinite loop integrals. At the same time, we also
evaluate the correction by the the dimensional regularization method without
exchanging the summations and the loop integrals. Then, we clearly show that
the regularized Casimir corrections from the KK states have the form of
$\propto 1/R^2$ for the Higgs mass and $\propto 1/R^4$ for the cosmological
constant, where $R$ is the compactification radius. We also evaluate the
Casimir energy in supersymmetric extra-dimensional models. The contributions
from bulk fermions and bulk bosons are not offset because we choose SUSY
breaking boundary conditions. The non-zero supersymmetric Casimir corrections
from extra dimensions undoubtedly contribute to the Higgs mass and the
cosmological constant. We conclude the coefficients of such corrections are
enhanced compared to the case without bulk supersymmetry.

parsec-resolution hydrodynamical simulation of an isolated gas-rich low mass
galaxy, we discuss here the non-linear effects of stellar feedback on the
properties of star clusters with a focus on the progenitors of nuclear
clusters. Our simulation shows two categories of star clusters: those for which
feedback expels gas leftovers associated with their formation sites, and those,
in a denser environment around which feedback fails at totally clearing the
gas. We confirm that radiation feedback (photo-ionization and radiative
pressure) plays a more important role than type-II supernovae in destroying
dense gas structures, and altering or quenching the subsequent cluster
formation. It also disturbs the cluster mass growth, by increasing the internal
energy of the gas component to the point when radiation pressure overcomes the
cluster gravity. We discuss how these effects may depend on the local
properties of the interstellar medium, and also on the details of the subgrid
recipes, which can affect the available cluster gas reservoirs, the evolution
of potential nuclear clusters progenitors, and the overall galaxy morphology.

Higgins-Thompson-Spiegelhalter (HTS) plug-in-type prediction interval has been
widely used, in which the heterogeneity parameter is replaced with its point
estimate, its validity depends on a large sample approximation. Most
meta-analyses, however, include less than 20 studies. It has been revealed that
the validity of the HTS method is not assured under realistic situations, but
no solution to this problem has been proposed in literature. Therefore, in this
article, we describe our proposed prediction interval. Instead of using the
plug-in scheme, we developed a bootstrap approach using an exact confidence
distribution to account for the uncertainty in estimation of the heterogeneity
parameter. Compared to the HTS method, the proposed method provides an accurate
prediction interval that adequately explains the heterogeneity of treatment

a uniquely powerful tool in the quest to understand the nature of dark matter.
Annihilation of dark matter to Standard Model particles between recombination
and reionization heats baryons, ionizes neutral hydrogen, and alters the CMB
visibility function. Surprisingly, CMB bounds on dark matter annihilation are
not expected to improve significantly with the dramatic improvements in
sensitivity expected in future cosmological surveys. In this paper, we will
present a simple physical description of the origin of the CMB constraints and
explain why they are nearly saturated by current observations. The essential
feature is that dark matter annihilation primarily affects the ionization
fraction which can only increase substantially at times when the universe was
neutral. The resulting change to the CMB occurs on large angular scales and
leads to a phenomenology similar to that of the optical depth to reionization.
We will demonstrate this impact on the CMB both analytically and numerically.
Finally, we will discuss the additional impact that changing the ionization
fraction has on large scale structure.

for prolonging the lifetime of wireless devices in energy-constrained networks.
This paper presents a general power beacon (PB) assisted multi-source
transmission, where a practical source selection scheme with information
transmission (IT) mode or non-IT mode is developed to maximize the transmission
reliability. In the IT mode, a zero-forcing (ZF) beamformed signal with no
interference to the destination is transmitted at the multi-antenna PB to
supply wireless energy for the sources, and bring non-negative effect to the
destination. Among multiple sources, the energy-sufficient source with the best
channel quality is selected for wireless information transmission (WIT), while
the other sources remain for energy harvesting. In the non-IT mode, the equal
power transmission is adopted at PB to focus on energy delivery. Using Markov
chain theory, the energy arrival and departure of each finite-capacity storage
at the source is characterized mathematically, and the comprehensive analytical
expressions of the energy outage probability (EOP), the connection outage
probability (COP), and the average transmission delay (ATD) are formulated and
derived. Our results reveal that the EOP, COP, and ATD can be significantly
improved via increasing the number of sources deployed in the proposed network
with finite transmit power of PB. We also prove that the multi-source network
will never experience energy outage with infinite transmit power of PB.

are known in the local ($D<200$ Mpc) neighborhood of the Milky Way, it is
highly likely that the UHECR acceleration takes place in some transient events.
In this paper we investigate scenario where the UHECRs are produced in strong
AGN flares. Using more than 7 years of the Fermi-LAT observations we select
candidate flares and, using correlation between jet kinetic luminosity and its
bolometric luminosity, estimate local kinetic emissivity of giant AGN flares:
$\mathcal{L}\sim3.7\times10^{44}\mathrm{erg~Mpc^{-3}~{yr^{-1}}}$. This value is
about an order of magnitude larger than the emissivity in the CRs with
$E>10^{20}$ eV, thus making this scenario feasible, if the UHECR escape
spectrum is rather hard and/or narrow. This shape of spectrum is predicted in a
number of present models of strong relativistic collisionless shocks. Also the
scenario of acceleration in AGN flares can accommodate constraints coming from
the observed arrival distribution of UHECRs. Finally, we demonstrate that in
case of heavier UHECR composition all the constraints are greatly relaxed.

impact Froude numbers. Overall two types of sprays are formed: Type I, which is
a cloud of droplets and ligaments generated at the impact of the plate's
leading edge with the water surface, and Type II, which is formed after the
trailing edge of the plate enters the local water surface. Detailed analysis of
the experimental data for the Type II spray revealed that the spray envelopes
and root point trajectories are independent of Froude number close to the
trailing edge, while further away reach higher vertical positions for larger
Froude numbers. The numerical simulation captures the general behavior of the
Type II spray and agrees favorably with the experimental results. A series of
computations with a flexible plate is also reported, where it is shown that
increased flexibility reduces the height of the spray and suppresses the
formation of droplets.

migration (type I migration) in a standard protoplanetary disk. Recent
magnetohydrodynamical simulations revealed the presence of magnetically driven
disk winds, which would alter the disk profile and the type I migration in the
close-in region. We investigate orbital evolution of planetary embryos in disks
that viscously evolve under the effects of disk winds. The aim is to discuss
effects of altered disk profiles on type I migration. In addition, we aim to
examine whether observed distributions of close-in super-Earths can be
reproduced by simulations that include effects of disk winds. We perform N-body
simulations of super-Earth formation from planetary embryos, in which a recent
model for disk evolution is used. We explore a wide range of parameters and
draw general trends. We also carry out N-body simulations of close-in
super-Earth formation from embryos in such disks under various conditions. We
find that the type I migration is significantly suppressed in many cases. Even
in cases in which inward migration occurs, the migration timescale is
lengthened to 1 Myr, which mitigates the type I migration problem. This is
because the gas surface density is decreased and has a flatter profile in the
close-in region due to disk winds. We find that when the type I migration is
significantly suppressed, planets undergo late orbital instability during the
gas depletion, leading to a non-resonant configuration. We also find that
observed distributions of close-in super-Earths (e.g., period ratio, mass
ratio) can be reproduced. In addition, we show that in some results of
simulations, systems with a chain of resonant planets, like the TRAPPIST-1

has no CFT dual. In bulk language, it has wormholes but it does not have black
hole microstates. It does however give some hint as to what could be added to
to rectify these issues, and we give an example of how this works using the SYK

paper we demonstrate that combining plasmonic resonance enhancements from
oligomers, with feature size of tens of nanometers, with a Rayleigh anomaly
caused by a 1-D set of periodic nanorods, having a period on the order of the
excitation wavelength, provides a mean to produce enhancement beyond that
constrained by losses in near field resonances. Metallic oligomers are
chemically assembled in between the periodic set of nanorods that are
fabricated using lithographic methods. The nanorod periodicity is investigated
to induce the Rayleigh anomaly at the oligomers plasmonic resonance wavelength
to further enhance the field in the oligomers hot spots. A thorough study of
this structure is carried out by using an effective analytical-numerical model
which is also compared to full-wave simulation results. Experimental results
comparing enhancements in surface enhanced Raman scattering measurements with

boosting the field enhancement. The proposed structure is expected to be

expected, which could be caused by a low baryonic temperature, and has been
interpreted as a sign for electromagnetic interactions between baryons and dark
matter. This hypothesis has a striking prediction: large temperature
anisotropies sourced by the velocity-dependent cooling of the baryons. However,
in order to remain consistent with the rest of cosmological observations, only

spectrum, and with an amplitude above any other known effects. These
fluctuations are uncorrelated with the usual adiabatic anisotropies, and would

thus providing a novel probe of dark matter at cosmic dawn.

dust is fully coupled with the gas, including its back-reaction onto it, and at
the same time the dust size is evolving according to coagulation and
fragmentation based on a sub-grid model. The aim of this analysis is to present
the differences occurring when dust evolution is included relative to
simulations with fixed dust size, with and without an embedded Jupiter-mass
planet that triggers gap formation. We use the two-fluid polar Godunov-type
code RoSSBi developed by Surville et al. 2016 combined with a new local
sub-grid method for dust evolution based on the model by Birnstiel et al. 2012.
We find striking differences between simulations with variable and fixed dust
sizes. The timescales for dust depletion differ significantly and yield a
completely different evolution of the dust surface density. In general sharp
features such as pile-ups of dust in the inner disk and near gap edges, when a
massive planet is present, become much weaker. This has important implications
on the interpretation of observed substructure in disks, suggesting that the
presence of a massive planet does not necessarily cause sharp gaps and rings in
the dust component. Also, particles with different dust sizes show a different
distribution, pointing to the importance of multi-wavelength synthetic
observations in order to compare with observations by ALMA and other
instruments. We also find that simulations adopting fixed intermediate particle
sizes, in the range $10^{-2} - 10^{-1}$ cm, best approximate the surface

have pinpointed the location of 26 Edgeworth-Kuiper belt analogs. We report
that a belt's distance $R$ to its host star correlates with the star's
luminosity $L_{\star}$, following $R\propto L^{0.19}_{\star}$ with a low
intrinsic scatter of $\sim$17%. Remarkably, our Edgeworth-Kuiper belt in the
Solar System and the two CO snow lines imaged in protoplanetary disks lie close
to this $R$-$L_{\star}$ relation, suggestive of an intrinsic relationship
between protoplanetary disk structures and belt locations. To test the effect
of bias on the relation, we use a Monte Carlo approach and simulate
uncorrelated model populations of belts. We find that observational bias could
produce the slope and intercept of the $R$-$L_{\star}$ relation, but is unable
to reproduce its low scatter. We then repeat the simulation taking into account
the collisional evolution of belts, following the steady state model that fits
the belt population as observed through infrared excesses. This significantly
improves the fit by lowering the scatter of the simulated $R$-$L_{\star}$
relation; however, this scatter remains only marginally consistent with the one
observed. The inability of observational bias and collisional evolution alone
to reproduce the tight relationship between belt radius and stellar luminosity
could indicate that planetesimal belts form at preferential locations within
protoplanetary disks. The similar trend for CO snow line locations would then
indicate that the formation of planetesimals and/or planets in the outer
regions of planetary systems is linked to the volatility of their building
blocks, as postulated by planet formation models.

an Ising gauge theory, that was recently shown in Monte Carlo simulations to
exhibit $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order and massless Dirac fermion
excitations. On tuning parameters, a confining phase with broken symmetry (an
antiferromagnet in one choice of Hamiltonian) was also established, and the
transition between these phases was found to be continuous, with co-incident
onset of symmetry breaking and confinement. While the confinement transition in
pure gauge theories is well understood in terms of condensing magnetic flux
excitations, the same transition in the presence of gapless fermions is a
challenging problem owing to the statistical interactions between fermions and
the condensing flux excitations. The conventional scenario then proceeds via a
two step transition, involving a symmetry breaking transition leading to gapped
fermions followed by confinement. In contrast, here, using large scale quantum
Monte Carlo simulations, we provide further evidence for a direct, continuous
transition and also find numerical evidence for an enlarged $SO(5)$ symmetry
rotating between antiferromagnetism and valence bond solid orders proximate to
criticality. Guided by our numerical finding, we develop a field theory
description of the direct transition involving an emergent non-abelian

This provides a ""pencil-beam"" complement to large-scale wide-field surveys,

associating them with young neutron stars. If this is the case, then the
presence of supernova ejecta and stellar winds provide a changing dispersion
measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM) that can potentially be probes of the
environments of FRB progenitors. Here we summarize the scalings for the DM and
RM in the cases of a constant density ambient medium and of a progenitor
stellar wind. Since the amount of ionized material is controlled by the
dynamics of the reverse shock, we find the DM changes more slowly than in
previous simpler work, which simply assumed a constant ionization fraction.
Furthermore, the DM can be constant or even increasing as the supernova remnant
sweeps up material, arguing that a young neutron star hypothesis for FRBs is
not ruled out if the DM is not decreasing over repeated bursts. The combined DM
and RM measurements for the repeating FRB 121102 are consistent with supernova
ejecta with an age of $\sim10^2-10^3\,{\rm yrs}$ expanding into a high density
($\sim100\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$) interstellar medium. This naturally explains its
relatively constant DM over many years as well. Other FRBs with much lower RMs
may indicate that they are especially young supernovae in wind environments or
that their DMs are largely from the intergalactic medium. We therefore caution
about inferring magnetic fields from simply by dividing an RM by DM, because
these quantities could originate from distinct regions along the path an FRB
propagates.

broad-band variability derived from the flux-calibrated data. We determine
variations of individual lines and its correlation with the total flux
variability. We detected variability of the spectral energy distribution and of
the line profiles. The variability has several sources of origin, including the
light absorption by the disk, pulsations, LBV-type variations, and eclipses in
the case of binaries. The stellar radiation of most of B[e] stars is heavily
obscured by circumstellar material. This suggests that the circumstellar
material is not present only in the disk but also above its plane. The flux and
line variability is consistent with a two-component model of circumstellar
environment composed of the dense disk and ionized envelope. The observations
of B[e] supergiants show that many of these stars have nearly the same
luminosity of about $1.9\times10^{5}\,L_\odot$ and similar effective
temperature.

require large amounts of training data. While weakly-supervised methods require
less supervision, by utilizing 2D poses or multi-view imagery without

  In this paper, we propose to overcome this problem by learning a

To this end, we use an encoder-decoder that predicts an image from one

encodes 3D geometry, using it in a semi-supervised setting makes it easier to
learn a mapping from it to 3D human pose. As evidenced by our experiments, our
approach significantly outperforms fully-supervised methods given the same

using as little as 1% of the labeled data.

accompanied by suppression of the effective scattering at other values of flux.
Both enhancement and suppression are due to the interference of processes with
multiple returns to magnetic impurity after a number of clockwise and

well-known weak-localization-induced enhancement of backscattering in

Renewal Monte Carlo (RMC), for infinite horizon Markov decision processes with

advantages of Monte Carlo methods including low bias, simplicity, and ease of
implementation while, at the same time, circumvents their key drawbacks of high
variance and delayed (end of episode) updates. The key ideas behind RMC are as
follows. First, under any reasonable policy, the reward process is ergodic. So,
by renewal theory, the performance of a policy is equal to the ratio of
expected discounted reward to the expected discounted time over a regenerative
cycle. Second, by carefully examining the expression for performance gradient,
we propose a stochastic approximation algorithm that only requires estimates of
the expected discounted reward and discounted time over a regenerative cycle
and their gradients. We propose two unbiased estimators for evaluating
performance gradients---a likelihood ratio based estimator and a simultaneous
perturbation based estimator---and show that for both estimators, RMC converges
to a locally optimal policy. We generalize the RMC algorithm to post-decision
state models and also present a variant that converges faster to an
approximately optimal policy. We conclude by presenting numerical experiments

representation of object shape structure have significant influence on shape
categorization accuracy, when dealing with real-world scenes featuring noisy,
partial and occluded object observations. An unsupervised hierarchical learning
procedure is utilized here to symbolically describe surface characteristics on
multiple semantic levels. Furthermore, a constellation model is proposed that
hierarchically decomposes objects. The decompositions are described as
constellations of symbols (shape motifs) in a gradual order, hence reflecting
shape structure from local to global, i.e., from parts over groups of parts to
entire objects. The combination of this multi-level description of surfaces and
the hierarchical decomposition of shapes leads to a representation which allows
to conceptualize shapes. An object discrimination has been observed in
experiments with seven categories featuring instances with sensor noise,
occlusions as well as inter-category and intra-category similarities.
Experiments include the evaluation of the proposed description and shape

distance functions, a need for large amounts of supervision, or difficulties in
scaling their inference algorithms to richer datasets. To mitigate these
issues, we present SPIRAL, an adversarially trained agent that generates a
program which is executed by a graphics engine to interpret and sample images.
The goal of this agent is to fool a discriminator network that distinguishes
between real and rendered data, trained with a distributed reinforcement
learning setup without any supervision. A surprising finding is that using the
discriminator's output as a reward signal is the key to allow the agent to make
meaningful progress at matching the desired output rendering. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an end-to-end, unsupervised

aggregate and frequently form a space spanning elastic gel are ubiquitous
materials in society with a wide range of applications. The colloidal networks
in these materials can exist in a mode of free settling when the network weight
exceeds its compressive yield stress. An equivalent state occurs when the
network is held fixed in place and used as a filter through which the
suspending fluid is pumped. In either scenario, hydrodynamic instabilities
leading to loss of network integrity occur. Experimental observations have
shown that the loss of integrity is associated with the formation of eroded
channels, so-called streamers, through which the fluid flows rapidly. However,
the dynamics of growth and subsequent mechanism of collapse remain poorly
understood. Here, a phenomenological model is presented that describes
dynamically the radial growth of a streamer due to erosion of the network by
rapid fluid back flow. The model exhibits a finite-time blowup -- the onset of
catastrophic failure in the gel -- due to activated breaking of the
inter-colloid bonds. Brownian dynamics simulations of hydrodynamically
interacting and settling colloids in dilute gels are employed to examine the
initiation and propagation of this instability, which is in good agreement with
the theory. The model dynamics are also shown to accurately replicate
measurements of streamer growth in two different experimental systems. The
predictive capabilities and future improvements of the model are discussed and
a stability-state diagram is presented providing insight into engineering
strategies for avoiding settling instabilities in networks meant to have long
shelf lives.

such. Unfortunately either poor time resolution or complete lack of plasma data
would have inhibited the confirmation of the notoriously required pressure

both cases the large mirror mode amplitudes suggest that mirror modes escape
quasilinear saturation being in a state of weak kinetic plasma turbulence.

  (Extended Version)","19 pages",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Routing protocols for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) have been extensively
studied for more than fifteen years. Position-based routing protocols route
packets towards the destination using greedy forwarding (i.e., an intermediate
node forwards packets to a neighbor that is closer to the destination than
itself). Different position-based protocols use different strategies to pick
the neighbor to forward the packet. If a node has no neighbor that is closer to
the destination than itself, greedy forwarding fails. In this case, we say
there is void (no neighboring nodes) in the direction of the destination.
Different position-based routing protocols use different methods for dealing
with voids. In this paper, we use a simple backtracking technique to deal with
voids and design a position-based routing protocol called ""Greedy Routing
Protocol with Backtracking (GRB)"". We compare the performance of our protocol
with the well known Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR) routing and the
Ad-Hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol as well as the Dynamic
Source Routing (DSR) protocol. Our protocol needs much less routing-control
packets than those needed by DSR, AODV, and GPSR. Simulation results also show
that our protocol has a higher packet-delivery ratio, lower end-to-end delay,

Tensor updates during the training phase are communication intensive and thus
TensorFlow's performance is heavily dependent on the underlying network and the

In particular, we study how the GR affects the dynamical evolution of the outer
Type-F particles, which experience an eccentric Lidov-Kozai mechanism. We carry
out N-body simulations with and without GR effects. When the GR is included,
the extreme values of \Omega are obtained for retrograde inclinations, while
the minimum and maximum inclinations allowed for Type-F particles increase in
comparison with that derived without GR effects. According to this, if the GR
is included in the simulations, the range of prograde (retrograde) inclinations
of the libration region is reduced (increased) respect to that obtained in
absence of GR. We find two new class of particles when the GR effects are
included in the simulations. On the one hand, particles whose orbital plane
flips from prograde to retrograde and back again without experiencing a
coupling between i and \Omega. On the other hand, retrograde particles that
show a strong coupling between i and \Omega. We infer that the GR may
significantly modify the dynamical properties of the outer reservoirs that

must be induced by the telescope optics. We apply the technique to observations
taken with the SPINOR at the DST and demonstrate that we can retrieve the
characteristic polarization properties of the DST at three wavelengths of 459,
526, and 615 nm. We determine the amount of crosstalk between the intensity
Stokes I and the linear and circular polarization states Stokes Q, U, and V,
and between Stokes V and Stokes Q and U. We fit a set of parameters that
describe the polarization properties of the DST to the observed crosstalk
values. The values for the ratio of reflectivities X and the retardance tau
match those derived with the telescope calibration unit within the error bars.
Residual crosstalk after applying a correction for the telescope polarization
stays at a level of 3-10%. We find that it is possible to derive the parameters
that describe the polarization properties of a telescope from observations of
spectral lines without intrinsic linear polarization signal. Such spectral
lines have a dense coverage (about 50 nm separation) in the visible part of the
spectrum (400-615 nm), but none were found at longer wavelengths. Using
spectral lines without intrinsic linear polarization is a promising tool for
the polarimetric calibration of current or future solar telescopes such as
DKIST.

It is shown that increasing the temporal and spatial resolution can mitigate

induced on dimers when illuminated with linearly polarized plane-waves. As
near-field observables, the spectra of torques showed more resolved resonances
than typical far-field spectra. Here the study is extended to silicon dimers.
Strong forces and torques are exerted by light under both polarizations s and
p, contrary to plasmonic systems where the resonant strong forces are found
only for p-polarization. The systems made of high-dielectric possess volume
resonances that induce the forces differently than in plasmonic systems, which
have surface resonances. The asymmetry in strong near-fields is responsible for
the unusual mechanics of the system. Some consequences of that may include the
breaking of the action-reaction principle or the appearance of pulling forces.

significant insight into the processes which yield the Sun's observed
differential rotation and cyclic dynamo action. However, as we move to higher
resolution simulations a variety of codes have encountered what has been termed
the convection conundrum. As these simulations increase in resolution and hence
the level of turbulence achieved, they tend to produce weak or even anti-solar
differential rotation patterns associated with a weak rotational influence
(high Rossby number) due to large convective velocities. One potential culprit
for this convection conundrum is the upper boundary condition applied in most
simulations which is generally impenetrable. Here we present an alternative
stochastic plume boundary condition which imposes small-scale convective plumes
designed to mimic near-surface convective downflows, thus allowing convection
to carry the majority of the outward solar energy flux up to and through our
simulated upper boundary. The use of a plume boundary condition leads to
significant changes in the convective driving realized in the simulated domain
and thus to the convective energy transport, the dominant scale of the
convective enthalpy flux, and the relative strength of the strongest downflows,
the downflow network, and the convective upflows. These changes are present
even far from the upper boundary layer. Additionally, we demonstrate that in
spite of significant changes, giant cell morphology in the convective patterns
is still achieved with self-organization of the imposed boundary plumes into
downflow lanes, cellular patterns, and even rotationally-aligned banana cells
in equatorial regions. This plume boundary presents an alternative pathway for
3D global convection simulations where driving is non-local and may provide a
new approach towards addressing the convection conundrum.

the additional Hessian terms that contain derivatives with respect to more than
one type of parameter is necessary. If a simple gradient-based minimization is
used, different choices of parameterization can be interpreted as different
preconditioners that change the condition number of the Hessian. If the
non-linear inverse problem is well-posed, then the inversion should converge to
a band-limited version of the true solution irrespective of the
parameterization choice, provided we start sufficiently close to the global
minimum. However, the choice of parameterization will affect the rate of
convergence to the exact solution and the best choice of parameterization is
the one with the fastest rate. In this paper, we search for the best choice for
acoustic multi-parameter full-waveform inversion, where 1. anomalies with a
size less than a quarter of the dominant wavelength have to be estimated
without the risk of converging to a local minimum; 2. the scattered wavefield
is recorded at all the scattering angles; 3. a steepest-descent minimization
scheme is used. Our examples suggest that the best choice of parameterization
depends on the contrast of the subsurface scatterer that the inversion tries to
estimate. Based on the results, we observe that there is no best
parameterization choice for full-waveform inversion. We also observe that a
parameterization using the acoustic impedance and mass density has the worst
convergence rate. Finally, we also show that the parameterization analysis
during a hierarchical inversion, where the data have limited scattering angles,
only helps to select a subspace for mono-parameter inversion. For
multi-parameter hierarchical inversion, the search for the best
parameterization in terms of the convergence speed might be obfuscated by
non-uniqueness problems.

three-component mixture model such that the observed weights of `null edges'
follow a normal distribution with mean 0, and the non-null edges follow a
mixture of two lognormal distributions, one for positively- and one for
negatively-correlated pairs. We show that this so-called L2N mixture model

quality. Preventable readmissions have been identified as one of the primary
targets for reducing costs and improving healthcare delivery. However, most
data driven studies for understanding readmissions have produced black box
classification and predictive models with moderate performance, which precludes
them from being used effectively within the decision support systems in the
hospitals. In this paper we present an application of structured
sparsity-inducing norms for predicting readmission risk for patients based on
their disease history and demographics. Most existing studies have focused on
hospital utilization, test results, etc., to assign a readmission label to each
episode of hospitalization. However, we focus on assigning a readmission risk
label to a patient based on their disease history. Our emphasis is on
interpreting the models to improve the understanding of the readmission
problem. To achieve this, we exploit the domain induced hierarchical structure
available for the disease codes which are the features for the classification
algorithm. We use a tree based sparsity-inducing regularization strategy that
explicitly uses the domain hierarchy. The resulting model not only outperforms
standard regularization procedures but is also highly sparse and interpretable.
We analyze the model and identify several significant factors that have an
effect on readmission risk. Some of these factors conform to existing beliefs,
e.g., impact of surgical complications and infections during hospital stay.
Other factors, such as the impact of mental disorder and substance abuse on
readmission, provide empirical evidence for several pre-existing but unverified
hypotheses. The analysis also reveals previously undiscovered connections such
as the influence of socioeconomic factors like lack of housing and
malnutrition.

The approach uses a general setup based on geometric graphs (networks of
curves), which means that particle diffusion in anything from arrays of
barriers and pore networks to general geometric domains can be considered and
that the (free random walk) central limit theorem can be generalized to cover
also the nonfree case. The latter gives rise to a continuum-limit description
of the diffusive motion where the effect of partially absorbing barriers is
accounted for in a natural and non-Markovian way that, in contrast to the
traditional approach, quantifies the absorptivity of a barrier in terms of a
dimensionless parameter in the range 0 to 1. The generalized theorem gives two
general analytic expressions for the continuum-limit propagator: an infinite
sum of Gaussians and an infinite sum of plane waves. These expressions entail
the known method-of-images and Laplace eigenfunction expansions as special
cases and show how the presence of partially absorbing barriers can lead to
phenomena such as line splitting and band gap formation in the plane wave
wave-number spectrum.

thermal ignition of an aluminum particle in the air is simulated with different
heat transfer models: continuum, free-molecular and Fuchs model. A single
parabolic oxidation law is assumed in the particle size range from nano- to
millimeter diameters. A particle is considered ignited when it reaches the
oxide melting point. The criterion defining the limits of validity for each
model is the ratio of continuum and free-molecular heat transfer rates. The
dependence of ignition temperature $T_i$ on particle size is in a qualitative
agreement with the experimental trends: $T_i$ can have values in the range
700--1500 K for nanoparticles due to the dominating contribution of a
free-molecular heat transfer, and sharp growth of $T_i$ with the particle size
in the range of 1-100 $\mu$m diameter is due to the transitional character of
heat transfer. For small values of accommodation coefficient, ignition may
occur in the critical ignition mode with the thermal runaway. The results
suggest the importance of heat transfer and, in particular, energy
accommodation in ignition of nano- and micro- sized particles.

  for efficient stochastic calculation of molecular integrals","13 pages",,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, the composite control-variate stratified sampling (CCSS) method
is presented for calculation of MO integrals without transformation of AO
integrals. The central idea of this approach is to obtain the 2-electron MO
integrals by direct integration of 2-electron coordinates. This method does not
require or use pre-computed AO integrals and the value of the MOs at any point
in space is obtained directly from the linear combination of AOs. The
integration over the electronic coordinates was performed using stratified
sampling Monte Carlo method. This approach was implemented by dividing the
integration region into a set of non-overlapping segments and performing Monte
Carlo calculations on each segment. The Monte Carlo sampling points for each
segment were optimized to minimize the total variance of the sample mean.
Additional variance reduction of the overall calculations was achieved by
introducing control-variate in the stratified sampling scheme. The composite
aspect of the CCSS allows for simultaneous computation of multiple MO integrals
during the stratified sampling evaluation. The main advantage of the CCSS
method is that unlike rejection sampling Monte Carlo methods such as Metropolis
algorithm, the stratified sampling uses all instances of the calculated
functions for the evaluation of the sample mean. The CCSS method is designed to
be used for large systems where AO-to-MO transformation is computationally
prohibitive. Because it is based on numerical integration, the CCSS method can
be applied to a wide variety of integration kernels and does not require
\textit{a priori} knowledge of analytical integrals. In this work, the
developed CCSS method was applied for calculation of excitonic properties in
CdSe quantum dots using electron-hole explicitly correlated Hartree-Fock

locally compact quantum groups in recent years. This paper demonstrates that
entropic uncertainty relations can be strengthened under localizations on
discrete quantum groups, which is the case if the dual compact quantum group
$\mathbb{G}$ is the free orthogonal quantum group $O_N^+$ with $N\geq 3$ or if
$\mathbb{G}$ admits an infinite $\Lambda(p)$ set with $p>2$. On the other hand,
this paper explains the reason why such phenomena do not appear when
$\mathbb{G}$ is one of the connected semisimple compact Lie groups, $O_2^+$ and
the quantum $SU(2)$ groups. Also, we discuss the divergence of entropic
uncertainty relations together with some explicit explanations.

wide range of application domains. Common practice is to tune the amount of
penalization to tradeoff bias and variance or to optimize some other measure of
performance of the estimated model. An advantage of such automated
model-building procedures is that their operating characteristics are
well-defined, i.e., completely data-driven, and thereby they can be
systematically studied. However, in many applications it is desirable to
incorporate domain knowledge into the model building process; one way to do
this is to characterize each model along the solution path of a penalized
regression estimator in terms of an operating characteristic that is meaningful
within a domain context and then to allow domain experts to choose from among
these models using these operating characteristics as well as other factors not
available to the estimation algorithm. We derive an estimator of the false
selection rate for each model along the solution path using a novel variable
addition method. The proposed estimator applies to both fixed and random
designs and allows for $p \gg n$. The proposed estimator can be used to
estimate a model with a pre-specified false selection rate or can be overlaid
on the solution path to facilitate interactive model exploration. We
characterize the asymptotic behavior of the proposed estimator in the case of a
linear model under a fixed design; however, simulation experiments show that
the proposed estimator provides consistently more accurate estimates of the
false selection rate than competing methods across a wide range of models.

technique that visualizes subcellular organization of single cells at
submolecular resolution and in near-native state. CECT captures large numbers
of macromolecular complexes of highly diverse structures and abundances.
However, the structural complexity and imaging limits complicate the systematic
de novo structural recovery and recognition of these macromolecular complexes.
Efficient and accurate reference-free subtomogram averaging and classification
represent the most critical tasks for such analysis. Existing subtomogram
alignment based methods are prone to the missing wedge effects and low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Moreover, existing maximum-likelihood based
methods rely on integration operations, which are in principle computationally
infeasible for accurate calculation.
  Results: Built on existing works, we propose an integrated method, Fast
Alignment Maximum Likelihood method (FAML), which uses fast subtomogram
alignment to sample sub-optimal rigid transformations. The transformations are
then used to approximate integrals for maximum-likelihood update of subtomogram
averages through expectation-maximization algorithm. Our tests on simulated and
experimental subtomograms showed that, compared to our previously developed
fast alignment method (FA), FAML is significantly more robust to noise and
missing wedge effects with moderate increases of computation cost.Besides, FAML
performs well with significantly fewer input subtomograms when the FA method
fails. Therefore, FAML can serve as a key component for improved construction
of initial structural models from macromolecules captured by CECT.

Then $\Gamma$ is {\it singular} if $A(\Gamma)$ is singular. The singularity of

we investigate this problem for Cayley graphs ${\rm Cay}(G,H)$ when $G$ is a
finite group and when the connecting set $H$ is a union of conjugacy classes of
$G.$ In this situation the singularity problem reduces to finding an
irreducible character $\chi$ of $G$ for which $\sum_{h\in H}\,\chi(h)=0.$
  At this stage we focus on the case when $H$ is a single conjugacy class $h^G$
of $G.$ Here the above equality is equivalent to $\chi(h)=0$. Much is known in
this situation, with essential information coming from the block theory of
representations of finite groups. An element $h\in G$ is called vanishing if
$\chi(h)=0$ for some irreducible character $\chi$ of $G.$ We study vanishing
elements mainly in finite simple groups and in alternating groups in

extends previous work of Pal who argued a Wright-Fisher limit for the
three-mass process under the conjectured Aldous diffusion until the

the first stationary, Markovian projection of the conjectured diffusion. Our
construction follows from that of a pair of interval partition-valued
diffusions that were previously introduced by the current authors as continuum
analogues of down-up chains on ordered Chinese restaurants with parameters
(1/2,1/2) and (1/2,0). These two diffusions are given by an underlying

unbiased, but traditional standard errors are overly conservative.
Additionally, there exists an alternative unbiased estimator that is more
efficient than the traditional DiD estimator under parallel trends. However,
when in population there is a non-zero pre-trend but we fail to reject the
hypothesis of parallel pre-trends, the DiD estimator is generally biased
relative to the population DiD coefficient. Moreover, if the trend is monotone,

two puzzles: this third order resonance hosts a surprisingly large population,
comparable to the prominent populations of Plutinos and Twotinos in the first
order 3:2 and 2:1 resonances, respectively; secondly, their eccentricities are
concentrated near $0.4$. To shed light on these puzzles, we investigate the
phase space near this resonance with use of Poincar\'e sections of the circular
planar restricted three body model. We find several transitions in the phase
space structure with increasing eccentricity, which we explain with the
properties of the resonant orbit relative to Neptune's. The resonance width is
narrow for very small eccentricities, but widens dramatically for
$e\gtrsim0.2$, reaching a maximum near $e\approx0.4$, where it is similar to
the maximum widths of the 2:1 and 3:2 resonances. We confirm these results with
N-body numerical simulations, including the effects of all four giant planets
and a wide range of orbital inclinations of the KBOs. We find that the
boundaries of the stable resonance zone are not strongly sensitive to
inclination and remain very similar to those found with the simplified three
body model, with the caveat that orbits of eccentricity above $\sim0.53$ are
unstable; higher eccentricity orbits are phase-protected from destabilizing
encounters with Neptune but not with Uranus. These results show that the 5:2
resonant KBOs are not more puzzling than the Plutinos and Twotinos; however,
detailed understanding of the origins of eccentric, inclined resonant KBOs

have been studied extensively in the last two decades, demonstrating great
success in both theory and practice. Two quantities are introduced, the noise
barrier and the large scale bias, that provides insights on the performance of
these convex regularized estimators. It is now well understood that the Lasso
achieves fast prediction rates, provided that the correlations of the design
satisfy some Restricted Eigenvalue or Compatibility condition, and provided
that the tuning parameter is large enough. Using the two quantities introduced
in the paper, we show that the compatibility condition on the design matrix is
actually unavoidable to achieve fast prediction rates with the Lasso. The Lasso
must incur a loss due to the correlations of the design matrix, measured in
terms of the compatibility constant. This results holds for any design matrix,
any active subset of covariates, and any tuning parameter. It is now well known
that the Lasso enjoys a dimension reduction property: the prediction error is
of order $\lambda\sqrt k$ where $k$ is the sparsity; even if the ambient
dimension $p$ is much larger than $k$. Such results require that the tuning
parameters is greater than some universal threshold. We characterize sharp
phase transitions for the tuning parameter of the Lasso around a critical
threshold dependent on $k$. If $\lambda$ is equal or larger than this critical
threshold, the Lasso is minimax over $k$-sparse target vectors. If $\lambda$ is
equal or smaller than critical threshold, the Lasso incurs a loss of order
$\sigma\sqrt k$ --which corresponds to a model of size $k$-- even if the target
vector has fewer than $k$ nonzero coefficients. Remarkably, the lower bounds
obtained in the paper also apply to random, data-driven tuning parameters. The
results extend to convex penalties beyond the Lasso.

slow rise phase with a duration of less than 12 hours and a speed of 0.1--0.7
km s$^{-1}$, while the other one only presents a slow rise phase but with an

methodical manner. We present an approach that uses a model to derive reward
bonuses as a means of intrinsic motivation to improve model-free reinforcement
learning. A key insight of our approach is that this dynamics model can be
learned in the latent feature space of a value function, representing the
dynamics of the agent and the environment. This method is both theoretically
grounded and computationally advantageous, permitting the efficient use of
Bayesian information-theoretic methods in high-dimensional state spaces. We
evaluate our method on several continuous control tasks, focusing on improving
exploration.

its intelligent grid monitoring and control. The requirements of the IoT
applications vary due to different tasks in the smart grid. In this paper, we
propose a new computing paradigm to offer location-aware, latencysensitive

particular, a new fog-based architecture and programming model is designed. Fog
computing extends computing to the edge of a network, which has a perfect match
to IoT applications. However, existing schemes can hardly satisfy the
distributed coordination within fog computing nodes in the smart grid. In the
proposed model, we introduce a new distributed fog computing coordinator, which
periodically gathers information of fog computing nodes, e.g., remaining
resources, tasks, etc. Moreover, the fog computing coordinator also manages
jobs so that all computing nodes can collaborate on complex tasks. In addition,
we construct a working prototype of intelligent electric vehicle service to
evaluate the proposed model. Experiment results are also presented to
demonstrate that our proposed model exceed the traditional fog computing
schemes for IoT applications in the smart grid.

higher DC-voltage differences. Also, a demonstration for a millimeter-wave

is proposed for future development. The final achievement of this paper is
design and fabrication of a wideband substrate integrated waveguide

equation for the position and velocity of the particles is a conditional

we study existence and uniqueness of the solution of the PDE in consideration.
Challenges arise from the fact that the PDE is neither elliptic (the linear

specific choices of the interaction function and for the simplified case in
which the density profile does not depend on the spatial variable, we show that
the model exhibits multiple stationary states (corresponding to the particles
forming a coordinated clockwise/anticlockwise rotational motion) and we study
convergence to such states as well. Finally, we prove mean-field convergence of
an appropriate $N$-particles system to the solution of our PDE: more precisely,
we show that the empirical measures of such a particle system converge weakly,

lines, 393.8 nm (near Fraunhofer CaK), 656.5 nm (H$\alpha$) and 589.1 nm

transparency and scintillation, as well as noise conditions for these laser
lines. For strong signals, we find that optical wavelengths are optimal for
distances $d\lesssim\,$kpc. Nd:YAG at $\lambda=1{,}064\,$nm is a similarly good
choice, within a factor of two, under most conditions and out to
$d\lesssim3\,$kpc. For weaker transmitters, where the signal-to-noise ratio
with respect to the blended host star is relevant, the optimal wavelength
depends on the background source, such as the stellar type. Fraunhofer spectral
lines, while providing lower stellar background noise, are irrelevant in most
use cases, as they are overpowered by other factors. Laser-pushed spaceflight
concepts, such as ""Breakthrough Starshot"", would produce brighter and tighter
beams than ever assumed for OSETI. Such beamers would appear as naked eye stars
out to kpc distances. If laser physics has already matured and converged on the

based strategy and ad hoc negotiation based strategy, for connected and
automated vehicles (CAVs) merging problems. The planning based strategy aims to
find the global optimal passing order, but it is time-consuming when the number
of considered vehicles is large. In contrast, the ad hoc negotiation based
strategy runs fast, but it always finds a local optimal solution. In this
paper, we propose a grouping based cooperative driving strategy to make a good
tradeoff between time consumption and coordination performance. The key idea is
to fix the passing orders for some vehicles whose inter-vehicle headways are
small enough (e.g., smaller than the pre-selected grouping threshold). From the
viewpoint of optimization, this method reduces the size of the solution space.
A brief analysis shows that the sub-optimal passing order found by the grouping
based strategy has a high probability to be close to the global optimal passing
order, if the grouping threshold is appropriately chosen. A series of
simulation experiments are carried out to validate that the proposed strategy
can yield a satisfied coordination performance with less time consumption and
is promising to be used in practice.

multipixel detectors, or a shorter observation cadence. We examine the limits

atmospheric scintillation, refraction, dispersion and receiver technology. We
find that optimal laser pulses are time-bandwidth limited Gaussians with a

Reducing friction, to allow or improve flowability, is usually achieved by
tuning the composition, either changing particle sizes and shapes or by adding
lubricating molecules. We present numerical simulations that demonstrate a
complementary approach whereby the viscosity divergence is shifted by driven
flow tuning, using superimposed shear oscillations in various configurations to
facilitate a primary flow. The oscillations drive the suspension towards an
out-of-equilibrium, absorbing state phase transition, where frictional particle
contacts that dominate the viscosity are reduced in a self-organizing manner.

(2D) materials have attracted tremendous interest. Their thermal transport
properties are closely related to the performance of 2D materials-based
devices. Here, the phonon transports of monolayer GeC with a perfect planar
hexagonal honeycomb structure are investigated by solving the linearized phonon
Boltzmann equation within the single-mode relaxation time approximation (RTA).
Without inclusion of Born effective charges ($Z^*$) and dielectric constants
($\varepsilon$), the lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_L$) almost decreases
linearly above 350 K, deviating from the usual $\kappa_L$$\sim$$1/T$ law. The
underlying mechanism is because the contribution to $\kappa_L$ from
high-frequency optical phonon modes increases with increasing temperature, and
the contribution exceeds one from acoustic branches at high temperature. These
can be understood by huge phonon band gap caused by large difference in atom
mass between Ge and C atoms, which produces important effects on scattering
process involving high-frequency optical phonon. When considering $Z^*$ and
$\varepsilon$, the phonon group velocities and phonon lifetimes of
high-frequency optical phonon modes are obviously reduced with respect to ones
without $Z^*$ and $\varepsilon$. The reduced group velocities and phonon
lifetimes give rise to small contribution to $\kappa_L$ from high-frequency
optical phonon modes, which produces the the traditional $\kappa_L$$\sim$$1/T$
relation in monolayer GeC. Calculated results show that the isotope scattering
can also reduce anomalous temperature dependence of $\kappa_L$ in monolayer
GeC. Our works highlight the importance of $Z^*$ and $\varepsilon$ to
investigate phonon transports of monolayer GeC.

the physical conditions suitable for developing a thermonuclear explosion.
Alternatively, the remnant may be prone to gravitational or rotational
instabilities, depending on the initial conditions reached after the
coalescence. Dipole magnetic braking is one of the mechanisms that can drive
such losses of angular momentum. However, the timescale on which these losses
occur depend on several parameters, like the strength of the magnetic field. In
addition, the coalescence leaves a surrounding Keplerian disk that can be
accreted by the newly formed white dwarf. Here we compute the post-merger
evolution of a super-Chandrasekhar magnetized white dwarf taking into account
all the relevant physical processes. These include magnetic torques acting on
the star, accretion from the Keplerian disk, the threading of the magnetic
field lines through the disk, as well as the thermal evolution of the white

assessing abnormal brain morphology associated to neuropathology. Age
prediction models are built on cohorts of healthy subjects and are built to
reflect normal aging patterns. The application of these multivariate models to
diseased subjects usually results in high prediction errors, under the
hypothesis that neuropathology presents a similar degenerative pattern as that
of accelerated aging. In this work, we propose an alternative to the idea that
pathology follows a similar trajectory than normal aging. Instead, we propose
the use of metrics which measure deviations from the mean aging trajectory. We
propose to measure these deviations using two different metrics: uncertainty in
a Gaussian process regression model and a newly proposed age weighted
uncertainty measure. Consequently, our approach assumes that pathologic brain
patterns are different to those of normal aging. We present results for
subjects with autism, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease to
highlight the versatility of the approach to different diseases and age ranges.
We evaluate volume, thickness, and VBM features for quantifying brain
morphology. Our evaluations are performed on a large number of images obtained
from a variety of publicly available neuroimaging databases. Across all
features, our uncertainty based measurements yield a better separation between
diseased subjects and healthy individuals than the prediction error. Finally,
we illustrate differences in the disease pattern to normal aging, supporting
the application of uncertainty as a measure of neuropathology.

in vivo biomedical devices to wearable smart systems. The capability of

miniaturized instruments, where size and weight are critical parameters. Given
their prevalence on the sensors market, flexible magnetic sensors play a major
role in this progress. For many high-performance applications, magnetic tunnel
junctions (MTJs) have become the first choice, due to their high sensitivity,
low power consumption etc. MTJs are also promising candidates for non-volatile
next-generation data storage media and, hence, could become central components
of wearable electronic devices. In this work, a generic low-cost regenerative
batch fabrication process is utilized to transform rigid MTJs on a 500 {\mu}m
silicon wafer substrate into 5 {\mu}m thin, mechanically flexible silicon
devices, and ensuring optimal utilization of the whole substrate. This method
maintains the outstanding magnetic properties, which are only obtained by
deposition of the MTJ on smooth high-quality silicon wafers. The flexible MTJs
are highly reliable and resistive to mechanical stress. Bending of the MTJ
stacks with a diameter as small as 500 {\mu}m is possible without compromising
their performance and an endurance of over 1000 cycles without fatigue has been
demonstrated. The flexible MTJs were mounted onto the tip of a cardiac catheter
with 2 mm in diameter without compromising their performance. This enables the
detection of magnetic fields and the angle which they are applied at with a
high sensitivity of 4.93 %/Oe and a low power consumption of 0.15 {\mu}W, while
adding only 8 {\mu}g and 15 {\mu}m to the weight and diameter of the catheter,

properties and the boundary regularity of the solutions of elliptic equations.
We prove by a new unified method the pointwise boundary H\""{o}lder regularity
under proper geometric conditions. ""Unified"" means that our method is
applicable for the Laplace equation, linear elliptic equations in divergence
and non-divergence form, fully nonlinear elliptic equations, the $p-$Laplace
equations and the fractional Laplace equations etc. In addition, these
geometric conditions are quite general. In particular, for local equations, the
measure of the complement of the domain near the boundary point concerned could
be zero. The key observation in the method is that the strong maximum principle
implies a decay for the solution, then a scaling argument leads to the
H\""{o}lder regularity. Moreover, we also give a geometric condition, which
guarantees the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation.
The geometric meaning of this condition is more apparent than that of the
Wiener criterion.

Monte Carlo search for the most probable value of the modulation potential was
performed to match data from different datasets for a given time. We used six
10Be series from Greenland and Antarctica, and the global 14C production
series. The 10Be series were resampled to match wiggles related to the grand
minima in the 14C reference dataset. The GRIP and the EDML 10Be series diverge
from each other during the second half of the Holocene, while the 14C series
lies between them. A likely reason for this is the insufficiently precise
beryllium transport and deposition model for Greenland. A slow 6-millennia
variability with lows at ca. 5500 BC and 1500 AD of solar activity is found.
Two components of solar activity can be statistically distinguished: the main
'normal' component and a component corresponding to grand minima. A possible
existence of a component representing grand maxima is indicated, but it cannot
be separated from the main component in a statistically significant manner. A
new consistent reconstruction of solar activity over the last nine millennia is
presented with the most probable values of decadal sunspot numbers and their
realistic uncertainties. Independent components of solar activity corresponding
to the main moderate activity and the grand-minimum state are identified; they
may be related to different operation modes of the dynamo.

effects such as Landau damping and, for the last model, finite Larmor radius
(FLR) corrections. The problem is considered in two space dimensions, when
initial conditions involve moderate-amplitude perturbations of a homogeneous

provide an accurate description of the velocity field up to the ion Larmor
radius scale, and even to smaller scales for the magnetic field.
Compressibility nevertheless appears significantly larger at the sub-ion scales

the origin of this discrepancy. A significant temperature anisotropy is
generated, with a bias towards the perpendicular component, the more intense

analysing them in isolation. Recent work has shown that ageing combined with
local mutations can help escape local optima on a dynamic optimisation
benchmark function. We generalise this result by rigorously proving that,
compared to evolutionary algorithms (EAs), ageing leads to impressive speed-ups
on the standard Cliff benchmark function both when using local and global
mutations. Unless the stop at first constructive mutation (FCM) mechanism is
applied, we show that hypermutations require exponential expected runtime to
optimise any function with a polynomial number of optima. If instead FCM is
used, the expected runtime is at most a linear factor larger than the upper
bound achieved for any random local search algorithm using the artificial
fitness levels method. Nevertheless, we prove that algorithms using
hypermutations can be considerably faster than EAs at escaping local optima. An
analysis of the complete Opt-IA reveals that it is efficient on the previously
considered functions and highlights problems where the use of the full
algorithm is crucial. We complete the picture by presenting a class of
functions for which Opt-IA fails with overwhelming probability while standard

respect to the free dynamics given by Fermi's golden rule. In a landmark
article, Nature 405, 546 (2000), Kofman and Kurizki concluded that in quantum
decay processes, acceleration of the decay by frequent measurements, called the
quantum anti-Zeno effect (AZE), appears to be ubiquitous, while its
counterpart, the quantum Zeno effect, is unattainable. However, up to now there
have been no experimental observations of the AZE for atomic radiative decay
(spontaneous emission) in free space. In this work, making use of analytical
results available for hydrogen-like atoms, we find that in free space, only
non-electric-dipolar transitions should present an observable AZE, revealing
that this effect is consequently much less ubiquitous than first predicted. We
then propose an experimental scheme for AZE observation, involving the electric
quadrupole transition between D 5/2 and S 1/2 in the heaviest alkali-earth ions
Ca + and Sr +. The proposed protocol is based on the STIRAP technique which
acts like a dephasing quasi-measurement.

structures, such as bladed disks of aircraft engines, has challenged engineers
in the past few decades. In the linear regime, localised states may arise due
to a lack of symmetry, as for example induced by inhomogeneities. However, when
structures deviate from the linear behaviour, e.g. due to material
nonlinearities, geometric nonlinearities like large deformations, or other
nonlinear elements like joints or friction interfaces, localised states may
arise even in perfectly symmetric structures. In this paper, a system
consisting of coupled Duffing oscillators with linear viscous damping is
subjected to external travelling wave forcing. The system may be considered a
minimal model for bladed disks in turbomachinery operating in the nonlinear
regime, where such excitation may arise due to imbalance or aerodynamic
excitation. We demonstrate that near the resonance, in this non-conservative
regime, localised vibration states bifurcate from the travelling waves. Complex
bifurcation diagrams result, comprising stable and unstable dissipative
solitons. The localised solutions can also be continued numerically to a
conservative limit, where solitons bifurcate from the backbone curves of the
travelling waves at finite amplitudes.

  Aims: We aim to characterise (i)~the nature of the individual components of

if and when it occurs - can be interpreted in an informed manner.
  Methods: We use infrared spectroscopy in the wavelength range 0.7micron -
2.5microns, to which we fit model atmospheres to represent the individual
stars. We use the binary ephemeris to determine the orbital phase at the time
of observation.
  Results: We find that the infrared spectrum is best fitted by a single
component having effective temperature 5920K, log[g]=4.1 and solar metallicity,
consistent with the fact that the system was observed at conjunction.
  Conclusions: The strength of the infrared H lines is consistent with a high
value of log[g], and the strength of the CaII triplet indicates the presence of
a chromosphere, as might be expected from rapid stellar rotation. The HeI
absorption we observe likely arises in He excited by coronal activity in a
circumstellar envelope, suggesting that the weakness of the CaII triplet is
also likely chromospheric in origin.

significances due to irreplaceable applications of soft matter in rather
diverse areas. This article is dedicated to draft a theoretical category on
interpreting the mechanisms lying behind all soft matters, which can be termed
as Softening Theory. A technical strategy with generalized purpose was proposed
for softening desired matter, i.e. the melting point of matter can be
significantly reduced through tuning its interior boundaries in atomic level.
This theory accords well with the classical nuclear droplet model that treats
the nucleus as a droplet which had successfully explained many phenomena. It
also explained the experimental fact that, the material's melting point is
drastically reduced as the particles become smaller enough, in which situations
effects of the atomic borders become much weaker. Along this direction, many
phenomena existing in nature can be well understood. For example, if keeping in
mind the fact that an atom consisting of nucleus and electronics can be
regarded as fluid, all the matter consisted of atoms should maintain fluidic
state in their macroscopic scale, according to the consistency between macro
and micro worlds. However, many substances just cannot remain their original
atomic fluidic behavior due to breaking of the consistency between macro and
micro states. Based on the current softening theory, it is now easy to
understand that the breaking of such consistency is just caused due to
generated forces from the atomic interactions. To resolve such intrinsic
confinement, a group of potential technical approaches can be developed to tune
the atomic borders of the matter and thus make desired soft materials. This
work provides a theoretical foundation to partially address the nature of the
material which will aid to make future soft matters in the coming time.

It is based on
the fact that a trade-off between the advantages of mobility and the cost of
mobility breaks with a significant deterioration in living conditions. The
recently developed model of purposeful kinesis (Gorban \& \c{C}abuko\v{g}lu,
Ecological Complexity 33, 2018) is based on the ""let well enough alone"" idea:
mobility decreases for high reproduction coefficient and, therefore, animals
stay longer in good conditions and leave quicker bad conditions. Mobility has a
cost, which should be measured in the changes of the reproduction coefficient.
Introduction of the cost of mobility into the reproduction coefficient leads to
an equation for mobility. It can be solved in a closed form using Lambert
$W$-function.
  Surprisingly, the ""let well enough alone"" models with the simple linear cost
of mobility have an intrinsic phase transition: when conditions worsen then the
mobility increases up to some critical value of the reproduction coefficient.
For worse conditions, there is no solution for mobility. We interpret this
critical effect as the complete loss of mobility that is degeneration of
diffusion. Qualitatively, this means that mobility increases with worsening of
conditions up to some limit, and after that, mobility is nullified.

rotation profile and meridional motions in agreement with previous studies

we found that the angular momentum is transported towards the solar equator.
The magnitude and latitudinal dependence of the horizontal component of the

Bilateral filtering. Our normalized cut loss approach to segmentation brings
the quality of weakly-supervised training significantly closer to fully

adoption dynamics of iWiW, an Online Social Network (OSN) in Hungary and
uncover empirical features about the spatial adoption in social networks.
During its entire life cycle from 2002 to 2012, iWiW reached up to 300 million
friendship ties of 3 million users. We find that the number of adopters as a
function of town population follows a scaling law that reveals a strongly
concentrated early adoption in large towns and a less concentrated late
adoption. We also discover a strengthening distance decay of spread over the
life-cycle indicating high fraction of distant diffusion in early stages but
the dominance of local diffusion in late stages. The spreading process is
modelled within the Bass diffusion framework that enables us to compare the
differential equation version with an agent-based version of the model run on
the empirical network. Although both models can capture the macro trend of
adoption, they have limited capacity to describe the observed trends of urban
scaling and distance decay. We find, however that incorporating adoption
thresholds, defined by the fraction of social connections that adopt a
technology before the individual adopts, improves the network model fit to the
urban scaling of early adopters. Controlling for the threshold distribution
enables us to eliminate the bias induced by local network structure on
predicting local adoption peaks. Finally, we show that geographical features

$C_i$ defines the maximum flow allowed on line $i$. Under an equal load
redistribution model, where load of failed lines is redistributed equally among
all remaining lines, we study the {\em optimization} problem of finding the
best $k$ lines to attack so as to minimize the number of {\em alive} lines at
the steady-state (i.e., when cascades stop). This is done to reveal the
worst-case attack vulnerability of the system as well as to reveal its most
vulnerable lines. We derive optimal attack strategies in several special cases
of load-capacity distributions that are practically relevant. We then consider
a modified optimization problem where the adversary is also constrained by the
{\em total} load (in addition to the number) of the initial attack set, and
prove that this problem is NP-Hard. Finally, we develop heuristic algorithms
for selecting the attack set for both the original and modified problems.
Through extensive simulations, we show that these heuristics outperform

them with the profiles of the Planck Compton y-maps. Together, this procedure

of the most natural examples of groups without Property (T), and which may be
useful to build an intuition of some of the main results of [C.Badea,

that Rendezvous is impossible in a basic model when robots have no lights, even
if the system is semi-synchronous. On the other hand, Rendezvous is possible if
robots have lights of various types with a constant number of colors. If robots
can observe not only their own lights but also other robots' lights, their
lights are called full-light. If robots can only observe the state of other

  In this paper, we focus on robots with external-lights in asynchronous
settings and a particular class of algorithms (called L-algorithms), where an
L-algorithm computes a destination based only on the current colors of
observable lights. When considering L-algorithms, Rendezvous can be solved by
robots with full-lights and 3 colors in general asynchronous settings (called
ASYNC) and the number of colors is optimal under these assumptions. In
contrast, there exists no L-algorithms in ASYNC with external-lights regardless
of the number of colors. In this paper, we consider a fairly large subclass of

with a finite number of colors, and we show that the algorithms are optimal in

This phenomenon leads to a challenging yet important problem, namely
fine-grained video attractiveness prediction. However, one major obstacle for
such a challenging problem is that no suitable benchmark dataset currently
exists. To this end, we construct the first fine-grained video attractiveness
dataset, which is collected from one of the most popular video websites in the
world. In total, the constructed FVAD consists of 1,019 drama episodes with
780.6 hours covering different categories and a wide variety of video contents.

video attractiveness while other engagements capture the interactions between
the viewers and videos. First, we demonstrate that video attractiveness and
different engagements present different relationships. Second, FVAD provides us
an opportunity to study the fine-grained video attractiveness prediction

the multimodal relationships between visual and audio components of the video
contents at different levels. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed sequential models with different visual and audio

Especially, the self-testing of entangled states is of great importance in

CHSH inequality maximally necessarily implies the bipartite shares a singlet.
One essential question in self-testing is that, when one observes a non-maximum
violation, how close is the tested state to the target state (which maximally
violates certain Bell inequality)? The answer to this question describes the
robustness of the used self-testing criterion, which is highly important in a
practical sense. Recently, J. Kaniewski predicts two analytic self-testing
bounds for bipartite and tripartite systems. In this work, we experimentally
investigate these two bounds with high quality two-qubit and three-qubit

the quantum space of a coherent space can be studied in terms of objects
defined directly on the coherent space. The results may be viewed as a
generalization of geometric quantization, including the non-unitary case.
  Care has been taken to work with the weakest meaningful topology and to
assume as little as possible about the spaces and groups involved. Unlike in
geometric quantization, the groups are not assumed to be compact, locally
compact, or finite-dimensional. This implies that the setting can be
successfully applied to quantum field theory, where the groups involved satisfy
none of these properties.
  The paper characterizes linear operators acting on the quantum space of a
coherent space in terms of their coherent matrix elements. Coherent maps and
associated symmetry groups for coherent spaces are introduced, and formulas are
derived for the quantization of coherent maps.
  The importance of coherent maps for quantum mechanics is due to the fact that
there is a quantization operator that associates homomorphically with every
coherent map a linear operator from the quantum space into itself. This
operator generalizes to general symmetry groups of coherent spaces the second
quantization procedure for free classical fields. The latter is obtained by
specialization to Klauder spaces, whose quantum spaces are the bosonic Fock
spaces. A coordinate-free derivation is given of the basic properties of
creation and annihilation operators in Fock spaces.

under-studied in prior literature. Instead of following the conventional sketch
recognition task, we introduce the novel problem of sketch hashing retrieval
which is not only more challenging, but also offers a better testbed for
large-scale sketch analysis, since: (i) more fine-grained sketch feature
learning is required to accommodate the large variations in style and
abstraction, and (ii) a compact binary code needs to be learned at the same
time to enable efficient retrieval. Key to our network design is the embedding
of unique characteristics of human sketch, where (i) a two-branch CNN-RNN
architecture is adapted to explore the temporal ordering of strokes, and (ii) a
novel hashing loss is specifically designed to accommodate both the temporal

that state-of-the-art hashing models specifically engineered for static images
fail to perform well on temporal sketch data. Our network on the other hand not
only offers the best retrieval performance on various code sizes, but also
yields the best generalization performance under a zero-shot setting and when
re-purposed for sketch recognition. Such superior performances effectively
demonstrate the benefit of our sketch-specific design.

turbulence regime of an Oldroyd-B fluid with periodic Kolmogorov mean flow are
investigated by means of extensive numerical simulations in two dimensions.
Both the small and large scale features of the resulting inhomogeneous particle
distribution are examined, focusing on their connection with the properties of
the advecting viscoelastic flow. We find that particles preferentially
accumulate on thin highly elastic propagating waves and that this effect is
largest for intermediate values of particle inertia. We provide a quantitative
characterization of this phenomenon that allows to relate it to the
accumulation of particles in filamentary highly strained flow regions producing
clusters of correlation dimension close to 1. At larger scales, particles are
found to undergo turbophoretic-like segregation. Indeed, our results indicate a
close relationship between the profiles of particle density and fluid velocity
fluctuations. The large-scale inhomogeneity of the particle distribution is
interpreted in the framework of a model derived in the limit of small, but
finite, particle inertia. The qualitative characteristics of different
observables are, to a good extent, independent of the flow elasticity. When
increased, the latter is found, however, to slightly reduce the globally
averaged degree of turbophoretic unmixing.

granular flows. We study a one-dimensional discontinuous dynamical system
(termed ""cutting and shuffling"" of a line segment), and we present a
comprehensive computational study of its finite-time mixing properties
including the effect of diffusion. To explore a large parameter space, we
introduce fit functions for two mixing metrics of choice: the number of cutting
interfaces (a standard quantity in dynamical systems theory of interval
exchange transformations) and a mixing norm (a more physical measure of
mixing). We compute averages of the mixing metrics across different
permutations (shuffling protocols), showing that the latter averages are a
robust descriptor of mixing for any permutation choice. If the decay of the
normalized mixing norm is plotted against the number of map iterations rescaled
by the characteristic e-folding time, then universality emerges: mixing norm
decay curves across all cutting and shuffling protocols collapse onto a single
stretched-exponential profile. Next, we predict this critical number of
iterations using the average length of unmixed subsegments of continuous color
during cutting and shuffling and a Batchelor-scale-type diffusion argument.
This prediction, called a ""stopping time"" for finite Markov chains, compares
well with the e-folding time of the stretched-exponential fit. Finally, we
quantify the effect of diffusion on cutting and shuffling through a P\'eclet
number (a dimensionless inverse diffusivity), showing that the system
transitions more sharply from an unmixed initial state to a mixed final state
as the P\'eclet number becomes large. Our numerical investigation of cutting

evidence for the latter phenomenon, known as a ""cut-off"" for finite Markov

the VVV survey's disk footprint spanning $\sim$70$^\circ$ of Galactic
longitude, using a machine-learned classifier. Novel data-driven methods were
employed to accurately characterize their spatial distribution using sparsely

was derived from their $K_s$-band light curve parameters using machine-learning

spectroscopic MDF of red clump giants and the MDF of bulge RRLs. We model the
MDF with a multi-component density distribution and find that the number
density of stars associated with the different model components systematically
changes with both the Galactocentric radius and vertical distance from the

consistency with results from the ARGOS survey, three MDF modes are attributed
to the old disk populations, while the most metal-poor RRLs are probably halo

source, with a thermal spectrum at a temperature of about 0.1 keV and
characteristic blackbody radius of about $10^4$ km. The other (CXOM51
J132946.1$+$471042) has a two-component spectrum with additional thermal-plasma
emission; it approached an X-ray luminosity of $10^{39}$erg s$^{-1}$ during
outbursts in 2005 and 2012. From the timing of three eclipses in a series of
{\it Chandra} observations, we determine the binary period ($52.75 \pm 0.63$
hr) and eclipse fraction ($22\% \pm 0.1\%$) of CXOM51 J132946.1$+$471042. We
also identify a blue optical counterpart in archival {\it Hubble Space
Telescope} images, consistent with a massive donor star (mass of $\sim$20--35
$M_{\odot}$). By combining the X-ray lightcurve parameters with the optical
constraints on the donor star, we show that the mass ratio in the system must
be $M_2/M_1 \gtrsim ~18$, and therefore the compact object is most likely a
neutron star (exceeding its Eddington limit in outburst). The general
significance of our result is that we illustrate one method (applicable to
high-inclination sources) of identifying luminous neutron star X-ray binaries,
in the absence of X-ray pulsations or phase-resolved optical spectroscopy.
Finally, we discuss the different X-ray spectral appearance expected from
super-Eddington neutron stars and black holes at high viewing angles.

consequences, yet formal analysis tools for P4 programs / networks are missing.
  We argue that formal analysis tools must be based on a formal semantics of
the target language, rather than on its informal specification. To this end, we
provide an executable formal semantics of the P4 language in the K framework.
Based on this semantics, K provides an interpreter and various analysis tools

a novel class of single-tap frequency domain (FD) receivers with a quasi-linear
computational complexity in block length, thanks to Fast-Fourier transform
(FFT) based implementation. This framework is exposed in detail, through the
design of a novel double-loop single-carrier frequency domain equalizer
(SC-FDE), where self-iterations of the equalizer with the demapper, and turbo
iterations with the decoder, provide numerous combinations for the performance
and complexity trade-off. Furthermore, the flexibility of this framework is
illustrated with the derivation of an overlap FDE, used for time-varying
channel equalization, among others, and with the design of a FD multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) detector, used for spatial multiplexing. Through these
different receiver design problems, this framework is shown to improve the

requirements, forcing datacenter operators to adopt domain-specific
accelerators to train them. These accelerators typically employ densely packed
full precision floating-point arithmetic to maximize performance per area.
Ongoing research efforts seek to further increase that performance density by
replacing floating-point with fixed-point arithmetic. However, a significant
roadblock for these attempts has been fixed point's narrow dynamic range, which
is insufficient for DNN training convergence. We identify block floating point
(BFP) as a promising alternative representation since it exhibits wide dynamic
range and enables the majority of DNN operations to be performed with
fixed-point logic. Unfortunately, BFP alone introduces several limitations that
preclude its direct applicability. In this work, we introduce HBFP, a hybrid
BFP-FP approach, which performs all dot products in BFP and other operations in
floating point. HBFP delivers the best of both worlds: the high accuracy of
floating point at the superior hardware density of fixed point. For a wide
variety of models, we show that HBFP matches floating point's accuracy while
enabling hardware implementations that deliver up to 8.5x higher throughput.

problem with reduced training datasets. Recent HTR solutions based on
artificial neural networks exhibit remarkable solutions in referenced

convolutional (CNN) and long short-term memory recurrent units (LSTM). In
addition, connectionist temporal classification (CTC) is the key to avoid
segmentation at character level, greatly facilitating the labeling task. One of
the main drawbacks of the CNNLSTM-CTC (CLC) solutions is that they need a
considerable part of the text to be transcribed for every type of calligraphy,
typically in the order of a few thousands of lines. Furthermore, in some
scenarios the text to transcribe is not that long, e.g. in the Washington
database. The CLC typically overfits for this reduced number of training
samples. Our proposal is based on the transfer learning (TL) from the
parameters learned with a bigger database. We first investigate, for a reduced
and fixed number of training samples, 350 lines, how the learning from a large
database, the IAM, can be transferred to the learning of the CLC of a reduced
database, Washington. We focus on which layers of the network could be not
re-trained. We conclude that the best solution is to re-train the whole CLC
parameters initialized to the values obtained after the training of the CLC
from the larger database. We also investigate results when the training size is
further reduced. The differences in the CER are more remarkable when training
with just 350 lines, a CER of 3.3% is achieved with TL while we have a CER of
18.2% when training from scratch. As a byproduct, the learning times are quite
reduced. Similar good results are obtained from the Parzival database when
trained with this reduced number of lines and this new approach.

which will be conducted in a follow-up paper, is to practical phase retrieval
problems where the aberration phase is sparse with respect to the orthogonal
basis of Zernike polynomials. Such a problem is called sparse phase retrieval
(SPR) problem in this paper. When the amplitude modulation at the exit pupil is
uniform, a new scheme of sparsity regularization on phase is proposed to
capture the sparsity property of the SPR problem. Based on this regularization
scheme, we design and analyze an efficient solution method, named SROP
algorithm, for solving SPR given only a single intensity point-spread-function
image. The algorithm is a combination of the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm with
the newly proposed sparsity regularization on the phase. The latter
regularization step is mathematically a rotation but with direction varying in
iterations. Surprisingly, this rotation is shown to be a metric projection on
an auxiliary set which is independent of iterations. As a consequence, SROP
algorithm is proved to be the cyclic projections algorithm for solving a
feasibility problem involving three auxiliary sets. Analyzing regularity

biological systems are often associated with the coefficient of linear

nonlinear friction that increases rapidly with the amplitude. Here we use a
modulated electromechanical resonator to show that nonlinear friction can be
made negative and sufficiently strong to overcome positive linear friction at
large vibration amplitudes. The experiment involves applying a drive that
simultaneously excites two phonons of the studied mode and a phonon of a faster
decaying high-frequency mode. We study generic features of the oscillator
dynamics with negative nonlinear friction. Remarkably, self-sustained
vibrations of the oscillator need to be activated in this case. When, in
addition, a resonant force is applied, a branch of large-amplitude forced
vibrations can emerge, isolated from the branch of the ordinary small-amplitude
response. Isolated branches of self-sustained and forced vibrations are
advantageous for applications in sensing and control.

use of perfect fluids in the stress-energy tensor, dark energy with an
equation-of-state parameter $w < -1$ (known as phantom dark energy) implies
negative kinetic energy and vacuum instability when modeled as a scalar field.
However, the accepted values for present-day $w$ from Planck and WMAP9 include
a significant range of values less than $-1$. A flip of the sign in front of
the kinetic energy term in the Lagrangian remedies the negative kinetic energy
but introduces ghostlike instabilities, which perhaps may be rendered
unobservable, but certainly not without great cost to the theory. Staying
within the confines of observational constraints and general relativity, we
treat dark energy as a quantum scalar field in the background of this 1st-order
FLRW space-time, find an approximation for the Green's function, and calculate
the expectation value of the field's kinetic energy for $w<-1$ using adiabatic
expansion to renormalize and obtain a finite value. We find that the kinetic
energy is positive for values of $w$ less than $-1$ in 0th- or 1st-order FLRW
space, thus giving more theoretical credence to observational values of $w<-1$
and demonstrating that phantom dark energy does not categorically have negative
kinetic energy. For a nonminimal coupling parameter $\xi=0$, kinetic energy is
positive for $w \gtrsim -1.22$, which includes virtually all values of constant
$w$ allowed by cosmological data constraints, and more negative values of $w$
give positive kinetic energy for non-zero values of $\xi$. Also, our results
are generally applicable for a massive free field or a field with a small
potential in a 0th- or 1st-order FLRW background dominated by a fluid with a

universe in the form of primordial black holes, a very large number of which
have many solar masses including up to the supermassive black holes at the
centres of galaxies. Certain upper bounds on dark astrophysical objects with
many solar masses based on analysis of the CMB spectrum and published in the
literature are criticised. For completeness we discuss WIMPs and axions which
are leading particle theory candidates for the constituents of dark matter. The
PIMBHs (Primordial Intermediate Mass Black Holes) with many solar masses should
be readily detectable in microlensing experiments which search the Magallenic
Clouds and measure light curves with durations of from one year up to several
years.

Hitchcock.
  Yet there is everything in correctly anticipating the bang a movie would make
in the box-office. Movies make a high profile, billion dollar industry and
prediction of movie revenue can be very lucrative. Predicted revenues can be
used for planning both the production and distribution stages. For example,
projected gross revenue can be used to plan the remuneration of the actors and
crew members as well as other parts of the budget [1].
  Success or failure of a movie can depend on many factors: star-power, release
date, budget, MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) rating, plot and the
highly unpredictable human reactions. The enormity of the number of exogenous
variables makes manual revenue prediction process extremely difficult. However,
in the era of computer and data sciences, volumes of data can be efficiently
processed and modelled. Hence the tough job of predicting gross revenue of a
movie can be simplified with the help of modern computing power and the
historical data available as movie databases [2].

heavy-tailed coupled Gaussian distribution or equivalently the Student's t
distribution. The coupled Gaussian is a member of a family of distributions
parameterized by the nonlinear statistical coupling which is the reciprocal of
the degree of freedom and is proportional to fluctuations in the inverse scale
of the Gaussian. Existing estimators of the scale of the coupled Gaussian have
relied on estimates of the full distribution, and they suffer from problems
related to outliers in heavy-tailed distributions. In this paper, the scale of
a coupled Gaussian is proven to be equal to the product of the generalized mean
and the square root of the coupling. From our numerical computations of the
scales of coupled Gaussians using the generalized mean of random samples, it is
indicated that only samples from a Cauchy distribution (with coupling parameter
one) form an unbiased estimate with diminishing variance for large samples.
Nevertheless, we also prove that the scale is a function of the geometric mean,
the coupling term and a harmonic number. Numerical experiments show that this
estimator is unbiased with diminishing variance for large samples for a broad
range of coupling values.

application of deep learning, particularly in areas such as medicine. In this
paper, we present a semi-supervised technique that addresses both these issues
by leveraging large unlabelled datasets to encode and decode images into a
dense latent representation. Using chest radiography as an example, we apply
this encoder to other labelled datasets and apply simple models to the latent
vectors to learn algorithms to identify heart failure.
  For each prediction, we generate visual rationales by optimizing a latent
representation to minimize the prediction of disease while constrained by a
similarity measure in image space. Decoding the resultant latent representation
produces an image without apparent disease. The difference between the original
decoding and the altered image forms an interpretable visual rationale for the
algorithm's prediction on that image. We also apply our method to the MNIST
dataset and compare the generated rationales to other techniques described in
the literature.

reconstruction, that expands upon, while incorporating, all previous correction
function sets and opens the possibility for improved performance. By
considering FR applied to the linear advection equation, and through
modification to the Sobolev norm, criteria are presented for a wider set of
correction functions. Legendre polynomials are then used to fulfil these
criterion and realise functions for third to fifth order FR. The sufficient
conditions for the existence of the modified norms are also explored, before
Fourier and Von Neumann analysis are applied to analytically find temporal
stability limits for various Runge-Kutta temporal integration schemes. For all
cases, correction functions are found that extend the temporal stability of FR.
Two application-inspired investigations are performed that aim to explore the
effect of aliasing and non-linear equations. In both cases unique correction
functions could be found that give good performance, compared to previous FR
schemes, while also improving upon the temporal stability limit.

  Discounting and Click-Through Rate Prediction",,,,,"stat.AP stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the cost per click (CPC) pricing model, an advertiser pays an ad network
only when a user clicks on an ad; in turn, the ad network gives a share of that
revenue to the publisher where the ad was impressed. Still, advertisers may be
unsatisfied with ad networks charging them for ""valueless"" clicks, or so-called
accidental clicks. [...] Charging advertisers for such clicks is detrimental in
the long term as the advertiser may decide to run their campaigns on other ad
networks. In addition, machine-learned click models trained to predict which ad
will bring the highest revenue may overestimate an ad click-through rate, and
as a consequence negatively impacting revenue for both the ad network and the
publisher. In this work, we propose a data-driven method to detect accidental
clicks from the perspective of the ad network. We collect observations of time
spent by users on a large set of ad landing pages - i.e., dwell time. We notice
that the majority of per-ad distributions of dwell time fit to a mixture of
distributions, where each component may correspond to a particular type of
clicks, the first one being accidental. We then estimate dwell time thresholds
of accidental clicks from that component. Using our method to identify
accidental clicks, we then propose a technique that smoothly discounts the
advertiser's cost of accidental clicks at billing time. Experiments conducted
on a large dataset of ads served on Yahoo mobile apps confirm that our
thresholds are stable over time, and revenue loss in the short term is
marginal. We also compare the performance of an existing machine-learned click
model trained on all ad clicks with that of the same model trained only on
non-accidental clicks. There, we observe an increase in both ad click-through
rate (+3.9%) and revenue (+0.2%) on ads served by the Yahoo Gemini network when
using the latter. [...]
