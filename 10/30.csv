recent years, fueled by three technological trends: a large amount of digitized
data openly accessible, a growing number of DL software frameworks in open
source and commercial markets, and a selection of affordable parallel computing
hardware devices. However, no single DL framework, to date, dominates in terms
of performance and accuracy even for baseline classification tasks on standard
datasets, making the selection of a DL framework an overwhelming task. This
paper takes a holistic approach to conduct empirical comparison and analysis of
four representative DL frameworks with three unique contributions. First, given
a selection of CPU-GPU configurations, we show that for a specific DL
framework, different configurations of its hyper-parameters may have a
significant impact on both performance and accuracy of DL applications. Second,
to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to identify the
opportunities for improving the training time performance and the accuracy of
DL frameworks by configuring parallel computing libraries and tuning individual
and multiple hyper-parameters. Third, we also conduct a comparative measurement
study on the resource consumption patterns of four DL frameworks and their
performance and accuracy implications, including CPU and memory usage, and
their correlations to varying settings of hyper-parameters under different
configuration combinations of hardware, parallel computing libraries. We argue
that this measurement study provides in-depth empirical comparison and analysis
of four representative DL frameworks, and offers practical guidance for service
providers to deploying and delivering DL as a Service (DLaaS) and for
application developers and DLaaS consumers to select the right DL frameworks
for the right DL workloads.

  Mathematical Biology",,,,"q-bio.CB q-bio.TO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cell-based, mathematical modeling of collective cell behavior has become a
prominent tool in developmental biology. Cell-based models represent individual
cells as single particles or as sets of interconnected particles, and predict
the collective cell behavior that follows from a set of interaction rules. In
particular, vertex-based models are a popular tool for studying the mechanics
of confluent, epithelial cell layers. They represent the junctions between
three (or sometimes more) cells in confluent tissues as point particles,
connected using structural elements that represent the cell boundaries. A
disadvantage of these models is that cell-cell interfaces are represented as
straight lines. This is a suitable simplification for epithelial tissues, where
the interfaces are typically under tension, but this simplification may not be
appropriate for mesenchymal tissues or tissues that are under compression, such
that the cell-cell boundaries can buckle. In this paper we introduce a variant
of VMs in which this and two other limitations of VMs have been resolved. The
new model can also be seen as on off-the-lattice generalization of the Cellular
Potts Model. It is an extension of the open-source package VirtualLeaf, which
was initially developed to simulate plant tissue morphogenesis where cells do
not move relative to one another. The present extension of VirtualLeaf
introduces a new rule for cell-cell shear or sliding, from which T1 and T2
transitions emerge naturally, allowing application of VirtualLeaf to problems
of animal development. We show that the updated VirtualLeaf yields different
results than the traditional vertex-based models for
differential-adhesion-driven cell sorting and for the neighborhood topology of
soft cellular networks.

outburst of classical novae confirms the suggestion made in the 70s that novae
could make $^7$Li. We reconsidered the role of novae as producers of Li by
means of a detailed model of the chemical evolution of the Milky Way. We showed
that novae could be the Galactic lithium source accounting for the observed
increase of Li abundances in the thin disk with stellar metallicity. The best
agreement with the upper envelope of the observed Li abundances is obtained for
a delay time of ~ 1 Gyr for the nova production and for an effective Li yield
of $1.8 (\pm 0.6) \times 10^{-5}$ $M_{\odot}$ over the whole nova life. Lithium
in halo stars is depleted by ~ 0.35 dex, assuming the pristine abundance from
standard big bang nucleosynthesis. We elaborate a model that matches the
pristine stellar abundances, assuming that all stars are depleted by 0.35 dex.
In this case, the delay remains the same, but the Li yields are doubled
compared to the previous case. This model also has the merit to match the Li
abundance in meteorites and young TTauri stars. The thick disk model, adopting
the parameters derived for the thin disk, can also explain the absence of
increase of Li abundances in its stars. The thick disk is old, but formed and
evolved in a time shorter than that required by novae to contribute
significantly to Li. Therefore, no Li enhancement is expected in thick disk
stars. We show that the almost constant Li abundance in the thick disk results
from the compensation of stellar astration by spallation processes.

This problem is trivial for $n=2, 3$ and apparently wild for $n\geq 5$. In this

from the theoretical bound for symmetric networks, i.e. $\alpha =1$. Inspired
by sleeping and dreaming mechanisms in mammal brains, we propose an extension
of this model displaying the standard on-line (awake) learning mechanism (that
allows the storage of external information in terms of patterns) and an
off-line (sleep) unlearning$\&$consolidating mechanism (that allows
spurious-pattern removal and pure-pattern reinforcement): this obtained daily
prescription is able to saturate the theoretical bound $\alpha=1$, remaining
also extremely robust against thermal noise. Both neural and synaptic features
are analyzed both analytically and numerically. In particular, beyond obtaining
a phase diagram for neural dynamics, we focus on synaptic plasticity and we
give explicit prescriptions on the temporal evolution of the synaptic matrix.
We analytically prove that our algorithm makes the Hebbian kernel converge with
high probability to the projection matrix built over the pure stored patterns.
Furthermore, we obtain a sharp and explicit estimate for the ""sleep rate"" in
order to ensure such a convergence. Finally, we run extensive numerical
simulations (mainly Monte Carlo sampling) to check the approximations

Amit-Gutfreund-Sompolinsky reference framework) and possible finite-size

are formed due to an enhanced scalar-perturbation amplitude, their formation is
inevitably accompanied by the generation of gravitational waves (GWs) with
frequency peaked in the mHz range, precisely around the maximum sensitivity of
the LISA mission. We show that, if these primordial black holes are the dark

the GW source signal is intrinsically non-Gaussian, the signal measured by LISA
is a sum of the signal from a large number of independent sources suppressing
the non-Gaussianity at detection to an unobservable level. We also discuss the
effect of the GW propagation in the perturbed universe. PBH dark matter
generically leads to a detectable, purely isotropic, Gaussian and unpolarised
GW signal, a prediction that is testable with LISA.

evolutionary mechanisms of stellar population gradients. We find that linear
metallicity gradients exhibit a clear correlation with galaxy morphological
type - with early type galaxies showing the steepest gradients. We show that
the metallicity gradients simply reflect the local mass-metallicity relation
within a galaxy. This suggests that the radial stellar population distribution
within a galaxys effective radius is primarily a result of the \emph{in-situ}
local star formation history. In this simple picture, the dynamically derived
stellar surface mass density gradient directly predicts the metallicity
gradient of a galaxy. We show that this correlation and its scatter can be
reproduced entirely by using independent empirical galaxy structural and
chemical scaling relations. Using Schwarzschild dynamical models, we also
explore the link between a galaxys local stellar populations and their orbital
structures. We find that galaxies angular momentum and metallicity gradients
show no obvious causal link. This suggests that metallicity gradients in the
inner disk are not strongly shaped by radial migration, which is confirmed by
the lack of correlation between the metallicity gradients and observable probes
of radial migration in the galaxies, such as bars and spiral arms. Finally, we
find that galaxies with positive metallicity gradients become increasingly
common towards low mass and late morphological types - consistent with stellar
feedback more efficiently modifying the baryon cycle in the central regions of
these galaxies.

matter of the universe has recently reacquired a lot of momentum. Observational
constraints, however, rule out this possibility for most of the PBH masses,
with a notable exception around $10^{-12} M_\odot$. These light PBHs may be
originated when a sizeable comoving curvature perturbation generated during
inflation re-enters the horizon during the radiation phase. During such a
stage, it is unavoidable that gravitational waves (GWs) are generated. Since
their source is quadratic in the curvature perturbations, these GWs are
generated fully non-Gaussian. Their frequency today is about the mHz, which is
exactly the range where the LISA mission has the maximum of its sensitivity.
This is certainly an impressive coincidence. We show that this scenario of PBHs
as dark matter can be tested by LISA by measuring the GW two-point correlator.
On the other hand, we show that the short observation time (as compared to the
age of the universe) and propagation effects of the GWs across the perturbed
universe from the production point to the LISA detector suppress the bispectrum
to an unobservable level. This suppression is completely general and not
specific to our model.

monitoring is promising, owing to the simplicity in circuitry design as well as

remains to be an extremely challenging task. A first-principle based structural
model using finite element discretization requires high dimensionality to
characterize the high-frequency response. As such, direct inversion using the

the identification problem may be cast into an optimization framework in which
fault parameters are identified through repeated forward finite element
analysis which however is oftentimes computationally prohibitive. This paper
presents an efficient data-assisted optimization approach for fault
identification without using finite element model iteratively. We formulate a
many-objective optimization problem to identify fault parameters, where
response surfaces of impedance measurements are constructed through Gaussian
process-based calibration. To balance between solution diversity and
convergence, an -dominance enabled many-objective simulated annealing algorithm
is established. As multiple solutions are expected, a voting score calculation
procedure is developed to further identify those solutions that yield better
implications regarding structural health condition. The effectiveness of the
proposed approach is demonstrated by systematic numerical and experimental case

for linear systems. First, if the control is not unique which is most input
energy efficient. Second, if exact tracking is infeasible which control
performs most accurately. These are typical challenges for over-actuated
systems and for under-actuated systems, respectively. We formulate both goals
as optimal output regulation problems. Then we contribute two new sets of
regulator equations to output regulation theory that provide the desired
solutions. A thorough study indicates solvability and uniqueness under weak
assumptions. E.g., we can always determine the solution of the classical
regulator equations that is most input energy efficient. This is of great value
if there are infinitely many solutions. We derive our results by a linear
quadratic tracking approach and establish a useful link to output regulation
theory.

  superlinear heat equations",,,,,"math.OC math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the semilinear heat equation posed on a smooth bounded domain
$\Omega$ of $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. The
control input is a source term localized in some arbitrary nonempty open subset
$\omega$ of $\Omega$. The goal of this paper is to prove the uniform large time
global null-controllability for semilinearities $f(s) = \pm |s|
\log^{\alpha}(2+|s|)$ where $\alpha \in [3/2,2)$ which is the case left open by
Enrique Fernandez-Cara and Enrique Zuazua in 2000. It is worth mentioning that
the free solution (without control) can blow-up. First, we establish the
small-time global nonnegative-controllability (respectively
nonpositive-controllability) of the system, i.e., one can steer any initial
data to a nonnegative (respectively nonpositive) state in arbitrary time. In
particular, one can act locally thanks to the control term in order to prevent
the blow-up from happening. The proof relies on precise observability estimates
for the linear heat equation with a bounded potential $a(t,x)$. More precisely,
we show that observability holds with a sharp constant of the order
$\exp\left(C |a|\_{\infty}^{1/2}\right)$ for nonnegative initial data. This
inequality comes from a new $L^1$ Carleman estimate. A Kakutani's fixed point
argument enables to go back to the semilinear heat equation. Secondly, the
uniform large time null-controllability result comes from three ingredients:
the global nonnegative-controllability, a comparison principle between the free
solution and the solution to the underlying ordinary differential equation
which provides the convergence of the free solution toward $0$ in
$L^{\infty}(\Omega)$-norm, and the local null-controllability of the semilinear
heat equation.

Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods have been combined with ABC to improve the
efficiency of particle proposals, but suffer from subjectivity and require many
simulations from the likelihood function. Likelihood-Free Inference by Ratio

directly but does not explore the parameter space efficiently. This work
proposes a classification approach that approximates population Monte Carlo
(PMC), where model class probabilities from classification are used to update
particle weights. This approach, called Classification-PMC, blends adaptive
proposals and classification, efficiently producing samples from the posterior

Classification-PMC outperforms two state-of-the-art methods: ratio estimation

about $10^9$ electrons can be accelerated to high energy, preserving emittance
and that the process is scalable with length. With this, an electron beam of
$O$(50 GeV) could be available for new fixed-target or beam-dump experiments
searching for the hidden sector, like dark photons. The rate of electrons on
target could be increased by a factor of more than 1000 compared to currently
available, leading to a corresponding increase in sensitivity to new physics.
Such a beam could also be brought into collision with a high-power laser and
thereby probe the completely unmeasured region of strong fields at values of
the Schwinger critical field. An ultimate goal is to produce an electron beam
of $O$(3 TeV) and collide with an LHC proton beam. This very high energy

reduce the radiation exposure to patient while the image quality is usually

been conducted to regularize CT image for better image quality. Yet, exploring
the underlying manifold where real CT images residing on is still an open

high quality low-dose CT reconstruction. In order to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework, network training, testing, and
comprehensive simulation study have been performed using patient abdomen CT

Initially details the key use cases for the TERRANOVA technology and presents
the description of the network architecture. In more detail, the use cases are
classified into two categories, namely backhaul & fronthaul and access and
small cell backhaul. The first category refers to fibre extender,
point-to-point and redundancy applications, whereas the latter is designed to
support backup connection for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),
internet of things (IoT) dense environments, data centres, indoor wireless
access, ad hoc networks, and last mile access. Then, it provides the networks
architecture for the TERRANOVA system as well as the network elements that need
to be deployed. The use cases are matched to specific technical scenarios,
namely outdoor fixed point-to-point (P2P), outdoor/indoor individual
point-to-multipoint (P2MP), and outdoor/indoor ""quasi""-omnidirection, and the
key performance requirements of each scenario are identified. Likewise, we
present the breakthrough novel technology concepts, including the joint design
of baseband signal processing for the complete optical and wireless link, the
development of broadband and spectrally efficient RF-frontends for frequencies
>275 GHz, as well as channel modelling, waveforms, antenna array and
multiple-access schemes design, which we are going to use in order to satisfy
the presented requirements. Next, an overview of the required new
functionalities in both physical (PHY) layer and medium access control (MAC)
layers in the TERRANOVA system architecture will be given. Finally, the
individual enablers of the TERRANOVA system are combined to develop particular
candidate architectures for each of the three technical scenarios.

demonstrate via transient and absolute photoluminescence (PL) experiments how
the incorporation of Sr significantly reduces the non-radiative recombination
losses in the neat perovskite layer and specifically at the perovskite/C60
interface. We show that Sr segregates at the perovskite surface, where it
induces important changes of morphology and energetics. Notably, the
Sr-enriched surface exhibits a wider band gap and a more n-type character,
accompanied with significantly stronger surface band bending. As a result, we
observe a significant increase of the quasi-Fermi level splitting in the neat
perovskite by reduced surface recombination and more importantly, a strong
reduction of losses attributed to non-radiative recombination at the interface
to the C60 electron-transporting layer. The resulting solar cells exhibited a
Voc of 1.18 V, which could be further improved to nearly 1.23 V through
addition of a thin polymer interlayer, bringing the non-radiative voltage loss
to only 110 meV. Our work shows that simply adding a small amount of Sr to the
precursor solutions induces a beneficial surface modification in the
perovskite, without requiring any post treatment, resulting in high efficiency
solar cells with power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 20.3%. Our results
demonstrate very high Voc values and efficiencies in Sr-containing quadruple
cation perovskite pin solar cells and highlight the imperative importance of
addressing and minimizing the recombination losses at the interface between

we introduce the fractional generalization of spin parity and prove that it

with a complex setup in nonequilibrium. The employed approach consists of a
very rudiment approximation for the RG equations which neglects all vertex
corrections while it provides a means to compute the effective dot Liouvillian
self-consistently. Being based on a weak-coupling expansion in the tunneling
between dot and reservoirs, the RTRG approach turns out to reliably describe
charge fluctuations in and out of equilibrium for arbitrary coupling strength,
even at zero temperature. We confirm this in the linear response regime with a
benchmark against highly-accurate numerically renormalization group data in the
exemplary case of three-level quantum dots. For small to intermediate bias
voltages and weak Coulomb interactions, we find an excellent agreement between
RTRG and functional renormalization group data, which can be expected to be
accurate in this regime. As a consequence, we advertise the presented RTRG
approach as an efficient and versatile tool to describe charge fluctuations
theoretically in quantum dot systems.

specific problems and specific hypothesis classes.
  As the current literature contains multiple definitions of adversarial risk

their goals, we identify one of them as the one guaranteeing misclassification
by pushing the instances to the error region. We then study some classic
algorithms for learning monotone conjunctions and compare their adversarial
risk and robustness under different definitions by attacking the hypotheses
using instances drawn from the uniform distribution. We observe that sometimes
these definitions lead to significantly different bounds. Thus, this study
advocates for the use of the error-region definition, even though other
definitions, in other contexts, may coincide with the error-region definition.
  Using the error-region definition of adversarial perturbations, we then study
inherent bounds on risk and robustness of any classifier for any classification
problem whose instances are uniformly distributed over $\{0,1\}^n$. Using the
isoperimetric inequality for the Boolean hypercube, we show that for initial
error $0.01$, there always exists an adversarial perturbation that changes
$O(\sqrt{n})$ bits of the instances to increase the risk to $0.5$, making
classifier's decisions meaningless. Furthermore, by also using the central
limit theorem we show that when $n\to \infty$, at most $c \cdot \sqrt{n}$ bits
of perturbations, for a universal constant $c< 1.17$, suffice for increasing
the risk to $0.5$, and the same $c \cdot \sqrt{n} $ bits of perturbations on
average suffice to increase the risk to $1$, hence bounding the robustness by
$c \cdot \sqrt{n}$.

Linear Arrangement (MaxDLA). This is a directed variant of a similar problem
for undirected graphs, in which however one seeks maximum and not minimum; this
problem known as the Minimum Linear Arrangement Problem (MinLA) has been much
studied in the literature. We establish a number of theorems illustrating the
behavior and complexity of MaxDLA. First, we relate MaxDLA to Maximum Directed
Cut (MaxDiCut) by proving that every simple digraph $D$ on $n$ vertices
satisfies $\frac{n}{2}$$maxDiCut(D) \leq MaxDLA(D) \leq (n-1)MaxDiCut(D)$.
Next, we prove that MaxDiCut is NP-Hard for planar digraphs (even with the
added restriction of maximum degree 15); it follows from the above bounds that
MaxDLA is also NP-Hard for planar digraphs. In contrast, Hadlock (1975) and
Dorfman and Orlova (1972) showed that the undirected Maximum Cut problem is
solvable in polynomial time on planar graphs.
  On the positive side, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for solving
MaxDLA on orientations of trees with degree bounded by a constant, which
translates to a polynomial-time algorithm for solving MinLA on the complements
of those trees. This pairs with results by Goldberg and Klipker (1976),
Shiloach (1979) and Chung (1984) solving MinLA in polynomial time on trees.
Finally, analogues of Harper's famous isoperimetric inequality for the

theoretical approach, we start from the fundamental, quantized minimal coupling
Hamiltonian of light-matter interaction and after a series of approximations
arrive at a closed system of equations for the two-point correlation function
of atomic coherences and the two-time correlation function of the emitted

emission in various regimes. It is extended consistently to include incoherent

Large spectroscopic surveys open the way to explore our Galaxy. In
order to use the data from these surveys to understand the Galactic stellar
population, we need to be sure that stars contained in a survey are a
representative subset of the underlying population. Without the selection
function taken into account, the results might reflect the properties of the
selection function rather than those of the underlying stellar population.
Aims. In this work, we introduce a method to estimate the selection function
for a given spectroscopic survey. We apply this method to a large sample of
public spectroscopic surveys. Methods. We apply a median division binning
algorithm to bin observed stars in the colour-magnitude space. This approach
produces lower uncertainties and lower biases of the selection function
estimate as compared to traditionally used 2D-histograms. We run a set of
simulations to verify the method and calibrate the one free parameter it
contains. These simulations allow us to test the precision and accuracy of the
method. Results. We produce and publish estimated values and uncertainties of
selection functions for a large sample of public spectroscopic surveys. We
publicly release the code used to produce the selection function estimates.
Conclusions. The effect of the selection function on distance modulus and
metallicity distributions of stars in surveys is important for surveys with
small and largely inhomogeneous spatial coverage. For surveys with contiguous
spatial coverage the effect of the selection function is almost negligible.

using compilers and intermediate representations (IRs) that apply optimizations

library developers must rewrite each function using a new IR. In this paper, we
propose a new technique called split annotations (SAs) that enables key data

developers to annotate functions and implement an API that specifies how to
partition data in the library. The annotation and API describe how to enable
cross-function data pipelining and parallelization, while respecting each
function's correctness constraints. We implement a parallel runtime for SAs in
a system called Mozart. We show that Mozart can accelerate workloads in

solutions that require rewriting libraries, and can sometimes outperform these

density/morphology of the stellar distribution. We investigate two possible
explanations for this morphology-quiescence relation: 1) the central density
results from a dissipative core-building event (""compaction"") that feeds an AGN
that quenches the galaxy and 2) the central density results from inside-out
growth by galaxy-wide star formation that is quenched by processes unrelated to
the central density. We aim to distinguish these two scenarios using the MaNGA
survey to determine profiles of stellar age, specific star formation rate
(sSFR) and gas phase metallicity (O/H) as a function of stellar mass surface
density within 1 kpc (Sigma_1kpc) and total stellar mass (M*). We find that
gradients in age, sSFR and O/H depend on the galaxy's position on the
Sigma_1kpc-M* diagram, suggesting at least two evolutionary pathways. The first
pathway consists of galaxies with low Sigma_1kpc for their M* whose centres are
old, metal-rich and suppressed in sSFR compared to their outskirts, consistent
with the inside-out growth scenario. The second pathway, consistent with a
compaction-like core-building scenario, consists of galaxies with higher
Sigma_1kpc for their M*, whose centres are younger, enhanced in sSFR and
metal-deficient compared to their outskirts. Moreover, the WISE-selected AGN
fraction peaks in the same area of the Sigma_1kpc-M* diagram as the
core-building pathway. The sSFR profiles of the quiescent population suggest
that galaxies on the compaction-like path quench uniformly, while those on the
inside-out growing path quench their centres first. Our results imply that both
pathways contribute to the morphology-quiescence relation.

Band 3 pointings and an effective survey area of ~200 sq. arcmin with a
continuum sensitivity that allows for the direct detection of unlensed Dusty

We present a catalog of 16 sources detected at >5sigma with flux densities

are then used to place constraints on the volume density of DSFGs with an
empirical backward evolution model. Our measured 3mm number counts indicate
that the contribution of DSFGs to the cosmic star formation rate density at z

a sharply decreasing contribution of obscured galaxies at z > 4 as inferred by
optical and near-infrared surveys. This work demonstrates the power of ALMA 3mm

the Latte suite of Fire-2 simulations, we find a strong correlation between the
velocity distribution of stars and dark matter at the solar circle that were
accreted from luminous satellites. This correspondence holds for dark matter
that is either relaxed or in kinematic substructure called debris flow, and is
consistent between two simulated hosts with different merger histories. The
correspondence is more problematic for streams because of possible spatial
offsets between the dark matter and stars. We demonstrate how to reconstruct
the dark matter velocity distribution from the observed properties of the
accreted stellar population by properly accounting for the ratio of stars to
dark matter contributed by individual mergers. After demonstrating this method
using the Fire-2 simulations, we apply it to the Milky Way and use it to
recover the dark matter velocity distribution associated with the recently

this predicted population of lensed $z>6$ quasars would be misclassified and
mixed up with low-$z$ galaxies. We quantify the fraction of undetected quasars
as a function of the slope of the bright end of the quasar luminosity function,
$\beta$. For $\beta \lesssim 3.6$, we predict that the undetected lensed
quasars could reach half of the population, whereas for $\beta \gtrsim 4.5$ the
vast majority of the $z > 6$ quasar population is lensed and still undetected.

galaxies (SMGs) from the ALESS survey of the Extended Chandra Deep Field South.
Our high-fidelity 0.07$''$-resolution imaging ($\sim$500 pc) reveals robust
evidence for structures with deconvolved sizes of $\lesssim$0.5-1 kpc embedded
within (dominant) exponential dust disks. The large-scale morphologies of the
structures within some of the galaxies show clear curvature and/or clump-like
structures bracketing elongated nuclear emission, suggestive of bars,
star-forming rings, and spiral arms. In this interpretation, the ratio of the
`ring' and `bar' radii (1.9$\pm$0.3) agrees with that measured for such
features in local galaxies. These potential spiral/ring/bar structures would be
consistent with the idea of tidal disturbances, with their detailed properties
implying flat inner rotation curves and Toomre-unstable disks (Q<1). The
inferred one-dimensional velocity dispersions ($\sigma_{\rm r}\lesssim$ 70-160
km s$^{-1}$) are marginally consistent with the limits implied if the sizes of
the largest structures are comparable to the Jeans length. We create maps of
the star formation rate density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) on $\sim$500 pc scales and
show that the SMGs are able to sustain a given (galaxy-averaged) $\Sigma_{\rm
SFR}$ over much larger physical scales than local (ultra-)luminous infrared
galaxies. However, on 500 pc scales, they do not exceed the Eddington limit set
by radiation pressure on dust. If confirmed by kinematics, the potential
presence of non-axisymmetric structures would provide a means for net angular
momentum loss and efficient star formation, helping to explain the very high
star formation rates measured in SMGs.

errors to assess cosmological parameter biases from uncertainties in n(z) in an
LSST-like survey. We use the power spectrum and the abundance of lensing peaks
to infer cosmological parameters, and find that the former is somewhat more
resilient to photo-z errors. We place conservative lower limits on the survey
size at which different types of photo-z errors degrade LCDM (wCDM) parameter
constraints by 50%. A residual constant photo-z bias of |dz| < 0.003(1+z),
satisfying the current LSST requirement, does not significantly degrade
constraints for surveys smaller than ~1300 (~490) square degrees using lensing
peaks and ~6500 (~4900) square degrees using the power spectrum. Adopting a
recent prediction for LSST's full photo-z probability distribution function
(PDF), we find that simply approximating n(z) with the photo-z galaxy
distribution directly computed from this PDF would degrade surveys as small as
~60 (~65) square degrees using lensing peaks or the power spectrum. Assuming
that the centroid bias in each tomographic redshift bin can be removed from the

degrades surveys larger than ~200 (~255) or ~248 (~315) square degrees. These

physical properties of CO-dark gas in two $z \sim 0$ disc galaxies, and develop
predictions for the expected intensities of promising alternative tracers ([CI
609 $\mu$m and [CII] 158 $\mu$m emission). We do this by combining cosmological
zoom simulations of disc galaxies with thermal-radiative-chemical equilibrium
interstellar medium (ISM) calculations to model the predicted H~\textsc{i} and
$\rm H_2$ abundances and CO(J=1-0), [CI] 609 $\mu$m and [CII] 158 $\mu$m
emission properties. Our model treats the ISM as a collection of radially
stratified clouds whose properties are dictated by their volume and column
densities, the gas-phase metallicity, and the interstellar radiation field and
cosmic ray ionization rates. Our main results follow. Adopting an
observationally motivated definition of CO-dark gas, i.e. $\rm H_2$ gas with
$W_{\rm CO} < 0.1 $ K-km/s, we find that a significant amount ($> 50\%$) of the
total $\rm H_2$ mass lies in CO-dark gas, most of which is diffuse gas, poorly
shielded due to low dust column density. The CO-dark molecular gas tends to be
dominated by [CII], though [CI] also serves as a bright tracer of the dark gas
in many instances. At the same time, [CII] also tends to trace neutral atomic
gas. As a result, when we quantify the conversion factors for the three
carbon-based tracers of molecular gas, we find that [CI] suffers the least
contamination from diffuse atomic gas, and is relatively insensitive to

the Eddington tensors calculated both from the raw data and from the M1-closure

complicated interplays of the fluid velocity and the neutrino interactions and
that the M1-closure, which assumes that the Eddington factor is determined by
the flux factor, fails to fully capture this aspect, especially in the vicinity
of the shock. We find that the error in the Eddington factor reaches $\sim

monotonically along the RG flow from the UV to the IR for a wide range of

nearly independent of location in the Galaxy. The full multi-element

results lead to a relatively simple picture of abundance ratio variations in
the Milky Way, in which the trends at any location can be described as the sum
of two components with relative contributions that change systematically and
smoothly across the Galaxy. Deviations from this picture and future extensions
to other elements can provide further insights into the physics of stellar
nucleosynthesis and unusual events in the Galaxy's history.

Nevertheless, there are still observables in this scenario, in particular the

obtain reliable predictions for a model which involves very heavy degrees of
freedom, the precise matching to an effective theory is necessary. While this
has been so far only studied for a few selected examples, we present an
extension of the ${\tt Mathematica}$ package ${\tt SARAH}$ to perform
automatically the matching between two scalar sectors at the full one-loop

for commonly studied models like split- or high-scale supersymmetry. One can
now easily go beyond that and study new ideas involving very heavy states,
where the effective model can either be just the standard model or an extension
of it. Also scenarios with several matching scales can be easily considered. We
provide model files for the MSSM with seven different mass hierarchies as well
as two high-scale versions of the NMSSM. Moreover, it is explained how new

lacking EUV photons ($h\nu>13.6\ \mathrm{eV}$) feature warm molecular outflows
that have typical poloidal speeds $\gtrsim 4\ \mathrm{km\ s}^{-1}$. When the
magnetization is sufficient to drive accretion rates $\sim 10^{-8}\ M_\odot\
\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, the wind mass-loss rate is comparable. Such outflows are
driven not centrifugally but by the pressure of toroidal magnetic fields
produced by bending the poloidal field. Both the accretion and outflow rates
increase with the poloidal field energy density, the former almost linearly.
The mass-loss rate is also strongly affected by ionization due to UV and X-ray
radiation near the wind base. Adding EUV irradiation to the system heats,
ionizes, and accelerates the part of the outflow nearest the symmetry axis, but
reduces the overall mass-loss rate by exerting pressure on the wind base. Most
of our models are non-turbulent, but some with reduced dust abundance and
therefore higher ionization fractions exhibit magnetorotational instabilities

Although Gaussian operations are ubiquitous in quantum optics, their
experimental realizations generally are approximations of the ideal Gaussian
unitaries. In this work, we study different performance criteria to analyze how
well these experimental approximations simulate the ideal Gaussian unitaries.
In particular, we find that none of these experimental approximations converge
uniformly to the ideal Gaussian unitaries. However, convergence occurs in the
strong sense, or if the discrimination strategy is energy bounded, then the
convergence is uniform in the Shirokov-Winter energy-constrained diamond norm

(${\rm M_{halo}}$) and the velocity along the flat portion of the rotation
curve (${\rm V_{flat}}$), derived from 120 late-type galaxies from the SPARC
database. The orthogonal scatter in this relation is comparable to the observed
scatter in the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR), indicating a tight
coupling between total halo mass and galaxy kinematics at $r\ll R_{\rm vir}$.
The small vertical scatter in the relation makes it an extremely competitive
estimator of total halo mass. We demonstrate that this conclusion holds true
for different priors on $M_*/L_{[3.6\mu]}$ that give a tight BTFR, but requires
that the halo density profile follows DC14 rather than NFW. We provide
additional relations between ${\rm M_{halo}}$ and other velocity definitions at
smaller galactic radii (i.e. ${\rm V_{2.2}}$, ${\rm V_{eff}}$, and ${\rm
V_{max}}$) which can be useful for estimating halo masses from kinematic
surveys, providing an alternative to abundance matching. Furthermore, we
constrain the dark matter analog of the Radial Acceleration Relation and also
find its scatter to be small, demonstrating the fine balance between baryons

prevent such models from capturing contextual long-range feature interactions.
In this work, we propose a simple, lightweight approach for better context
exploitation in CNNs. We do so by introducing a pair of operators: gather,
which efficiently aggregates feature responses from a large spatial extent, and
excite, which redistributes the pooled information to local features. The
operators are cheap, both in terms of number of added parameters and
computational complexity, and can be integrated directly in existing
architectures to improve their performance. Experiments on several datasets
show that gather-excite can bring benefits comparable to increasing the depth
of a CNN at a fraction of the cost. For example, we find ResNet-50 with
gather-excite operators is able to outperform its 101-layer counterpart on
ImageNet with no additional learnable parameters. We also propose a parametric
gather-excite operator pair which yields further performance gains, relate it
to the recently-introduced Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks, and analyse the
effects of these changes to the CNN feature activation statistics.

question for decades. Here, we use a combination of hydrodynamic simulations
and general physical arguments to demonstrate that UHECRs can in principle be
produced by diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in shocks in the backflowing
material of radio galaxy lobes. These shocks occur after the jet material has
passed through the relativistic termination shock. Recently, several authors
have demonstrated that highly relativistic shocks are not effective in
accelerating UHECRs. The shocks in our proposed model have a range of
non-relativistic or mildly relativistic shock velocities more conducive to
UHECR acceleration, with shock sizes in the range 1-10kpc. Approximately 10% of
the jet's energy flux is focused through a shock in the backflow of $M>3$.
Although the shock velocities can be low enough that acceleration to high
energy via DSA is still efficient, they are also high enough for the Hillas
energy to approach $10^{19-20}$eV, particularly for heavier CR composition and
in cases where fluid elements pass through multiple shocks. We discuss some of
the more general considerations for acceleration of particles to ultra-high
energy with reference to giant-lobed radio galaxies such as Centaurus A and
Fornax A, a class of sources which may be responsible for the observed
anisotropies from UHECR observatories.

scattering experiments, we calculate the distribution of the ejected stars'
velocities given various parameters of the IMBH-SMBH binary: IMBH mass,
semimajor axis and eccentricity. We also calculate the rates of change of the
BH binary orbital elements due to those stellar ejections. One of our new
findings is that the ejection rate depends (although mildly) on the rotation of
the stellar nucleus (its total angular momentum). We also compare the ejection
velocity distribution with that produced by the Hills mechanism (stellar binary
disruption) and find that the latter produces faster stars on average. Also,
the IMBH mechanism produces an ejection velocity distribution which is
flattened towards the BH binary plane while the Hills mechanism produces a

However, considerable progress has been achieved in past years due to
observations performed by the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array.
Above $10^{18}$ eV the observed energy spectrum presents two features: a
hardening of the slope at $\sim 10^{18.6}$ eV, which is known as the ankle, and
a suppression at $\sim 10^{19.6}$ eV. The composition inferred from the
experimental data, interpreted by using the current high energy hadronic
interaction models, seems to be light below the ankle, showing a trend to
heavier nuclei for increasing values of the primary energy. Also, the
anisotropy information is consistent with an extragalactic origin of this light
component that would dominate the spectrum below the ankle. Therefore, the
models that explain the ankle as the transition from the galactic and
extragalactic components are disfavored by present data. Recently, it has been
proposed that this light component originates from the photodisintegration of
more energetic and heavier nuclei in the source environment. The formation of
the ankle can also be explained by this mechanism. In this work we study in
detail this general scenario but in the context of the central region of active
galaxies. In this case, the cosmic rays are accelerated near the supermassive
black hole present in the central region of these types of galaxies, and the
photodisintegration of heavy nuclei takes place in the radiation field that
surrounds the supermassive black hole.

gas emissions, which expel ice and soil debris and leave behind large craters.
This phenomenon appears to be caused by a buildup of pressure from below the
permafrost, possibly due to gas released as permafrost melts, followed by a
sudden emission of gas through the surface. Although there have been some
studies modeling the processes involved in crater formation using
computationally complex models, we propose that these explosive events can be
attributed to a simple heat diffusion-based process. Under certain boundary
conditions and parameters, this may be sufficient to describe the explosive
behavior observed. We demonstrate this effect by linearly increasing surface
temperature from average monthly values (1961-1990) at an example latitude,
which causes more dramatic melting from below the permafrost than above. This
may lead to a buildup of gas pressure, if the permafrost is both continuous and
has a high ice saturation, and has the potential for sudden gas release.

encryption to fully implement its program without relying on other techniques,
such as multiparty computation (SMPC), which may be impossible in many use
cases (for instance due to the high level of communication required). We
proceed in two steps: i) on the basis of the structured program theorem
(Bohm-Jacopini theorem) we identify the relevant minimal set of operations
homomorphic encryption must be able to perform to implement any algorithm; and
ii) we analyse the possibility to solve -- and propose an implementation for --
the most fundamentally relevant issue as it emerges from our analysis, that is,
the implementation of conditionals (requiring comparison and selection/jump
operations). We show how this issue clashes with the fundamental requirements
of homomorphic encryption and could represent a drawback for its use as a
complete solution for privacy preservation in data-based applications, in
particular machine learning ones. Our approach for comparisons is novel and
entirely embedded in homomorphic encryption, while previous studies relied on
other techniques, such as SMPC, demanding high level of communication among
parties, and decryption of intermediate results from data-owners. Our protocol
is also provably safe (sharing the same safety as the homomorphic encryption
schemes), differently from other techniques such as

using an optimal closure method, and these models are employed to approximate
the relaxation toward equilibrium of systems governed by the two-dimensional
Euler equations, as well as the quasi-geostrophic equations for either
single-layer or two-layer flows. Optimal closure refers to a general method of
reduction for Hamiltonian systems, in which macroscopic states are required to
belong to a parametric family of distributions on phase space. In the case of
point vortex ensembles, the macroscopic variables describe the spatially
coarse-grained vorticity. Dynamical closure in terms of those macrostates is
obtained by optimizing over paths in the parameter space of the reduced model
subject to the constraints imposed by conserved quantities. This optimization
minimizes a cost functional that quantifies the rate of information loss due to
model reduction, meaning that an optimal path represents a macroscopic
evolution that is most compatible with the microscopic dynamics in an
information-theoretic sense. A near-equilibrium linearization of this method is
used to derive dissipative equations for the low-order spatial moments of
ensembles of point vortices in the plane. These severely reduced models
describe the late-stage evolution of coherent structures in two-dimensional and
geostrophic turbulence. For single-layer dynamics, they approximate the
relaxation of initially distorted structures toward axisymmetric equilibrium
states. For two-layer dynamics, they predict the rate of energy transfer in
baroclinically perturbed structures returning to stable barotropic states.
Comparisons against direct numerical simulations of the fully-resolved
many-vortex dynamics validate the predictive capacity of these reduced models.

atomic language units but not necessarily atomic semantic units. Inspired by
HowNet, we use sememes, the minimum semantic units in human languages, to
represent the implicit semantics behind words for language modeling, named
Sememe-Driven Language Model (SDLM). More specifically, to predict the next
word, SDLM first estimates the sememe distribution gave textual context.
Afterward, it regards each sememe as a distinct semantic expert, and these
experts jointly identify the most probable senses and the corresponding word.
In this way, SDLM enables language models to work beyond word-level
manipulation to fine-grained sememe-level semantics and offers us more powerful
tools to fine-tune language models and improve the interpretability as well as
the robustness of language models. Experiments on language modeling and the
downstream application of headline gener- ation demonstrate the significant
effect of SDLM. Source code and data used in the experiments can be accessed at

  Hourly Wave Parameters",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Statistically simulated time series of wave parameters are required for many
coastal and offshore engineering applications, often at the resolution of
approximately one hour. Various studies have relied on autoregressive
moving-average (ARMA) processes to simulate synthetic series of wave parameters
in a Monte Carlo sense. However, accurately representing inter-series
dependencies has remained a challenge. In particular, the relationship between
wave height and period statistics is complex, due to the limiting steepness
condition. Here, we present a new simulation method for joint time series of
significant wave height, mean zero-crossing periods and a directional regime
variable. The latter distinguishes between northern and southwestern waves. The
method rests on several model components which include renewal processes,
Fourier series with random coefficients, ARMA processes, copulas and
regime-switching. A particular feature is a data-driven estimate for a wave
height-dependent limiting wave steepness condition which is used to facilitate
copulabased dependence modeling. The method was developed for and applied to a
data set in the Southern North Sea. For this site, the method could simulate
time series with realistic annual cycles and inter-annual variability. In the
time series data, the bivariate distribution of significant wave height and
mean zero-crossing period was well represented. An influence of the directional
regime on the bivariate distribution could also be modeled. However, the
influence was not as strong in simulated data as in observed data. Finally,
simulated series captured duration and inter-arrival time of storm events well.
Potential applications for output of the simulation method range from the
assessment of coastal risks or design of coastal structures to the planning and
budgeting of offshore operations.

drawback of the state-of-the-art have been designing a WCN in which the
service-oriented performance measures (e.g., throughput) are optimized without
considering different relevant decisions such as determining the location and
allocating the resources, jointly. In this study, we address the UAVBS location
and bandwidth allocation problems together to optimize the total network
profit. In particular, a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP)
formulation is developed, in which the location of a single UAVBS and bandwidth
allocations to users are jointly determined. The objective is to maximize the
total profit without exceeding the backhaul and access capacities. The profit
gained from a specific user is assumed to be a piecewise-linear function of the
provided data rate level, where higher data rate levels would yield higher
profit. Due to high complexity of the MINLP, we propose an efficient heuristic
algorithm with lower computational complexity. We show that, when the UAVBS
location is determined, the resource allocation problem can be reduced to a
Multidimensional Binary Knapsack Problem (MBKP), which can be solved in
pseudo-polynomial time. To exploit this structure, the optimal bandwidth
allocations are determined by solving several MBKPs in a search algorithm. We
test the performance of our algorithm with two heuristics and with the MINLP

proposed algorithm outperforms the alternative solution approaches and would be
a promising tool to improve the total network profit.

debated. Searching for specific fitness advantages in the archaeological record
has proven difficult, as these may be obscured, absent, or subject to
interpretation. Proposed models have therefore featured either fitness
advantages in favor of anatomically modern humans, or invoked neutral drift
under various preconditions. To bridge this gap, we rigorously compare the
system-level properties of fitness- and drift-based explanations of Neanderthal
replacement. Our stochastic simulations and analytical predictions show that,
although both fitness and drift can produce fixation, they present important
differences in 1) required initial conditions, 2) reliability, 3) time to
replacement, and 4) path to replacement (population histories). These results
present useful opportunities for comparison with archaeological and genetic
data. We find far greater agreement between the available empirical evidence

problem of detecting bots in online social networks and assessing their impact

social networks and identify that they exhibit heterophily, meaning they
interact with humans more than other bots. We use this property to develop a
detection algorithm based on the Ising model from statistical physics. The bots
are identified by solving a minimum cut problem. We show that this Ising model
algorithm can identify bots with higher accuracy while utilizing much less data
than other state of the art methods.
  We then develop a a function we call generalized harmonic influence
centrality to estimate the impact bots have on the opinions of users in social
networks. This function is based on a generalized opinion dynamics model and
captures how the activity level and network connectivity of the bots shift
equilibrium opinions. To apply generalized harmonic influence centrality to
real social networks, we develop a deep neural network to measure the opinions
of users based on their social network posts. Using this neural network, we
then calculate the generalized harmonic influence centrality of bots in
multiple real social networks. For some networks we find that a limited number
of bots can cause non-trivial shifts in the population opinions. In other
networks, we find that the bots have little impact. Overall we find that
generalized harmonic influence centrality is a useful operational tool to
measure the impact of bots in social networks.

(AR) NOAA 11476. For the analysis we use observations in multiple wavelengths

space instruments. The magnetic configuration showed the presence of two
rotating bipoles, with decreasing magnetic flux, within the following polarity
of the AR. This evolution was present along some tens of hours before the
studied event and continued even later. A minifilament with a length of
$\approx 30 \arcsec$ lay along the photospheric inversion line of the largest
bipole. The minifilament was observed to erupt accompanied by an M4.7 flare
(SOL20120509T12:23:00). Consequently, dense material, as well as twist, was
injected along closed loops in the form of a very broad ejection whose
morphology resembles that of typical H$\alpha$ surges. We conclude that the
flare and eruption can be explained as due to two reconnection processes, one
occurring below the erupting minifilament and another one above it. This second
process injects the minifilament plasma within the reconnected closed loops

force-free model of the coronal field, we identify the location of
quasi-separatix layers (QSLs), where reconnection is prone to occur, and
present a detailed interpretation of the chromospheric and coronal eruption
observations. In particular, this event, contrary to what has been proposed in
several models explaining surges and/or jets, is not originated by magnetic
flux emergence but by magnetic flux cancellation accompanied by the rotation of
the bipoles. In fact, the conjunction of these two processes, flux cancellation
and bipole rotations, is at the origin of a series of events, homologous to the

traditional clustering methods are discrete and non-differentiable, and thus

our theoretical understanding of galaxies to extremely low mass. We examine the
formation of UFDs by twice running a fully cosmological simulations of dwarf
galaxies, but varying star formation. One run uses a temperature-density
threshold for star formation, while the other uses an H$_{2}$-based sub-grid
star formation model. The total number of dwarf galaxies that forms is
different by a factor of 2 between the two runs, but most of these are
satellites, leading to a factor of 5 difference in the number of luminous UFD
companions around more massive, isolated dwarfs. The first run yields a 47\%
chance of finding a satellite around a M$_{halo}$ $\sim 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$
host, while the H$_2$ run predicts only a 16\% chance. Metallicity is the
primary physical parameter that creates this difference. As metallicity
decreases, the formation of H$_2$ is slowed and relegated to higher-density
material. Thus, our H$_2$ run is unable to form many (and often, any) stars
before reionization removes gas. These results emphasize that predictions for
UFD properties made using hydrodynamic simulations, in particular regarding the
frequency of satellites around dwarf galaxies, the slope of the stellar mass
function at low masses, as well as the properties of ultra-faint galaxies
occupying the smallest halos, are extremely sensitive to the subgrid physics of
star formation contained within the simulation. However, upcoming discoveries
of ultra-faint dwarfs will provide invaluable constraining power on the physics
of the first star formation.

combine the Discrete Fracture Model (DFM) to model the local effects of

reduction technique, enables capturing the multiscale flow dynamics. This is
accomplished by systematically generating an approximation space through
solving a series of local snapshot and spectral problems. The resulting
eigenfunctions can pass the local features to the global level when acting as
basis functions in coarse problems. Our goal in this paper is to further
improve the accuracy of flow simulation in complicated reservoirs especially
for the case when multiple discrete fractures located in single coarse

detailed description of the model, several numerical experiments are conducted
to confirm the success of our proposed method. A rigid proof is also given in
the aspect of numerical analysis.

hole, show in their power spectra quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs). Those at
highest frequencies show up in pairs and are named twin peak high frequency
QPOs (HF QPOs). Their central frequencies are typical of the orbital motion
timescale close to the compact object. HF QPOs are believed to carry unique
information on the matter moving in the extreme gravitational field around the
compact object. In previous works we highlighted the work done by strong tides
on clumps of plasma orbiting in the accretion disk as suitable mechanism to
produce the HF QPOs. We showed that the upper of the twin peak HF QPOs seen in
NS LMXBs could originate from the tidal circularization of the clump's
relativistic orbit, while the lower HF QPO could come from the spiraling clump
losing orbital energy. Here we focus on the tidal deformation of a magnetized
clump of plasma once tides load energy on it. The likely evolution of the shape
of the clump after tidal circularization of the orbit and its subsequent
orbital evolution are investigated. In atoll NS LMXBs, a subclass of NS LMXBs
less luminous than Z NS LMXBs, the lower HF QPO displays a characteristic
behavior of its coherence $Q$ versus its central frequency $\nu$. $Q$ keeps
increasing over the range of frequencies $\nu\sim$ 600-850 Hz and then drops
abruptly at $\nu\sim$ 900 Hz. We note, for the first time, that such behavior
is reproduced by magnetized clumps of plasma stretched by strong tides and
falling onto the NS on unstable orbits. We emphasize the overall behavior of
the lower HF QPO coherence as candidate to disclose the innermost stable bound
orbit predicted by the general relativity theory in the strong field regime.

multiple peak points, only one of which is global maximum. Conventional maximum
power point tracking (MPPT) methods are not able to extract maximum power in
this condition. In this paper, a novel two-stage MPPT method is presented to
overcome this drawback. In the first stage, a method is proposed to determine
the occurrence of PSC, and in the second stage, using a new algorithm that is
based on ramp change of the duty cycle and continuous sampling from the P-V

P&O algorithm is then re-activated to trace small changes of the new MPP. Open

recreational photography. However, aerial photographs of public places often
contain faces of bystanders thus leading to a perceived or actual violation of
privacy. To address this issue, we propose to pseudo-randomly modify the
appearance of face regions in the images using a privacy filter that prevents a
human or a face recogniser from inferring the identities of people. The filter,
which is applied only when the resolution is high enough for a face to be
recognisable, adaptively distorts the face appearance as a function of its
resolution. Moreover, the proposed filter locally changes its parameters to
discourage attacks that use parameter estimation. The filter exploits both
global adaptiveness to reduce distortion and local hopping of the parameters to
make their estimation difficult for an attacker. In order to evaluate the
efficiency of the proposed approach, we use a state-of-the-art face recognition
algorithm and synthetically generated face data with 3D geometric image
transformations that mimic faces captured from an MAV at different heights and
pitch angles. Experimental results show that the proposed filter protects

Sparse regression techniques provide potential solutions, one notable approach
being the Bayesian methods based on shrinkage priors. In the ""large n & large

repeated sampling from a high-dimensional Gaussian distribution, whose
precision matrix $\Phi$ is expensive to compute and factorize. In this article,
we present a novel algorithm to speed up this bottleneck based on the following
observation: we can cheaply generate a random vector $b$ such that the solution
to the linear system $\Phi \beta = b$ has the desired Gaussian distribution. We
can then solve the linear system by the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm
through matrix-vector multiplications by $\Phi$; this involves no explicit
factorization or calculation of $\Phi$ itself. Rapid convergence of CG in this
context is guaranteed by the theory of prior-preconditioning we develop. We
apply our algorithm to a clinically relevant large-scale observational study

the relative risk of adverse events from two alternative blood anti-coagulants.

affect drivers' control of their vehicles, and that drivers adapt over time to
persistent changes in sensory cues (for example in driving simulators), but the
mechanisms underlying these behavioural phenomena are poorly understood. Here,
we consider the existing literature on how driver steering in slalom tasks is
affected by the down-scaling of vestibular cues, and propose a driver model
that can explain the empirically observed effects, namely: decreased task
performance and increased steering effort during initial exposure, followed by
a partial reversal of these effects as task exposure is prolonged.
Unexpectedly, the model also reproduced another empirical finding: a local
optimum for motion down-scaling, where path-tracking is better than when
one-to-one motion cues are available. Overall, the results imply that: (1)
drivers make direct use of vestibular information as part of determining
appropriate steering, and (2) motion down-scaling causes a yaw rate
underestimation phenomenon, where drivers behave as if the simulated vehicle is
rotating more slowly than it is. However, (3) in the slalom task, a certain
degree of such yaw rate underestimation is beneficial to path tracking
performance. Furthermore, (4) behavioural adaptation, as empirically observed
in slalom tasks, may occur due to (a) down-weighting of vestibular cues, and/or
(b) increased sensitivity to control errors, in determining when to adjust
steering and by how much, but (c) seemingly not in the form of a full
compensatory rescaling of the received vestibular input. The analyses presented
here provide new insights and hypotheses about simulator driving, and the
developed models can be used to support research on multisensory integration
and behavioural adaptation in both driving and other task domains.

a loss function, which balances the discrepancy between outputs for the
previous classes from the memory and updated networks, and the
mis-classification rate between outputs for the new classes from the updated

  radially unbalanced flow",,,,"physics.ao-ph physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Emanuel's concept of Maximum Potential Intensity (E-PI) relates the maximum
velocity $V_{\rm max}$ of tropical storms, assumed to be in gradient wind
balance, to environmental parameters. Several studies suggested that the
unbalanced flow is responsible for E-PI sometimes significantly underpredicting
$V_{\rm max}$. Additionally, two major modifications generated a considerable
range of E-PI predictions: the dissipative heating and the power expended to
lift water were respectively suggested to increase and reduce E-PI $V_{\rm
max}$ by about 20%. Here we re-derive the E-PI concept separating its dynamic
and thermodynamic assumptions and lifting the gradient wind balance limitation.
Our analysis reveals that E-PI formulations for a balanced and a radially
unbalanced flow are similar, while the systematic underestimate of $V_{\rm
max}$ reflects instead an incompatibility between several E-PI assumptions. We
discuss how these assumptions can be modified. We further show that
irrespective of whether dissipative heating occurs or not, E-PI uniquely
relates $V_{\rm max}$ to the latent heat flux (not to the total oceanic heat
flux as originally proposed). We clarify that, in contrast to previous
suggestions, lifting water has little impact on E-PI. We demonstrate that in
E-PI the negative work of the pressure gradient in the upper atmosphere
consumes all the kinetic energy generated in the boundary layer. This key
dynamic constraint is independent of other E-PI assumptions and thus can apply
to diverse circulation patterns. Finally, we show that the E-PI maximum kinetic
energy per unit volume equals the local partial pressure of water vapor and
discuss the implications of this finding for predicting $V_{\rm max}$.

a TMLE that targets the CSDE directly. These estimators are applicable for a
variety of study designs, including randomized encouragement trials, like the
MTO housing voucher experiment we consider as an illustrative example,
treatment discontinuities, and Mendelian randomization. We found the IPTW
estimator to be the most sensitive to finite sample bias, resulting in bias of
over 40% even when all models were correctly specified in a sample size of
N=100. In contrast, the EE estimator and compatible TMLE estimator were far
less sensitive to finite samples. The EE and TMLE estimators also have
advantages over the IPTW estimator in terms of efficiency and reduced reliance

hence a suitable source of Binos. The discussion is carried out in the
framework of the $\mu \nu$SSM, where the presence of $R$-parity violating (RPV)
couplings involving right-handed neutrinos solves the $\mu$ problem and can
reproduce simultaneously the neutrino data. Left sneutrinos/sleptons are pair
produced at $pp$ collisions decaying to Binos, with the latter decaying via RPV
to $W\ell$ or $Z\nu$. This signal can be compared with LHC searches for
electroweak superpartners through chargino-neutralino production. The reduced
cross section of the sneutrino/slepton production in comparison with the one of
the latter process, limits the sensitivity of the searches to small
sneutrino/slepton masses. Although the resulting compressed spectrum typically
evades the aforementioned searches, we show that analyses using recursive
jigsaw reconstruction are sensitive to these scenarios. As a by-product, we
find that the region of Bino masses $110-120$ GeV and sneutrino masses
$120-140$ GeV can give rise to a tri-lepton signal compatible with the local

loss is leveraged to control the violation from quantization bounds due to two
properties: 1- It is differentiable, 2- It is less sensitive to outliers than
the quadratic loss. A Smooth Rank Approximation is utilized to endorse lower
rank on the genuine data matrix. Thus, an unconstrained optimization problem

simulations produce these centrifugal force supported steady shock waves even
in presence of strong dragging of inertial frames. Since the post-shock region
could be hot and upscatter photons through Comptonization, these shock would
put imprints on the spectra. Thus, our solutions, which represent truly new
results, could be useful to measure spins through radiation spectrum of
accreting Kerr black holes.

In this work we propose a hybrid architecture that works both in the k-space

composed of a complex-valued residual U-net in the k-space domain, an inverse
Fast Fourier Transform (iFFT) operation, and a real-valued U-net in the image

proposed hybrid approach can potentially improve CS reconstruction compared to
deep-learning networks that operate only in the image domain. In this study we
compare our method with four previously published deep neural networks and
examine their ability to reconstruct images that are subsequently used to
generate regional volume estimates. We evaluated undersampling ratios of 75%
and 80%. Our technique was ranked second in the quantitative analysis, but
qualitative analysis indicated that our reconstruction performed the best in
hard to reconstruct regions, such as the cerebellum. All images reconstructed

applications, the behavior of many complex systems is determined by some form
of planner picking the right actions to optimize a given objective function. In
many cases, the mapping of plans to objective reward may change due to
unforeseen events or circumstances in the real world. In those cases, the
planner usually needs some additional effort to adjust to the changed situation
and reach its previous level of performance. Whenever we still need to continue
polling the planner even during re-planning, it oftentimes exhibits severely
lacking performance. In order to improve the planner's resilience to unforeseen
change, we argue that maintaining a certain level of diversity amongst the
considered plans at all times should be added to the planner's objective.
Effectively, we encourage the planner to keep alternative plans to its
currently best solution. As an example case, we implement a diversity-aware
genetic algorithm using two different metrics for diversity (differing in their
generality) and show that the blow in performance due to unexpected change can
be severely lessened in the average case. We also analyze the parameter
settings necessary for these techniques in order to gain an intuition how they
can be incorporated into larger frameworks or process models for software and

using conservative abstract interpretation to statically reason about the
behavior of the embedded JavaScript code. Currently, state-of-the-art tools
either: (1) statically identify PDF malware based on structural similarity to
known malicious samples; or (2) dynamically execute the code to detect
malicious behavior. These two approaches are subject to evasion attacks that
mimic the structure of benign documents or do not exhibit their malicious
behavior when being analyzed dynamically. In contrast, abstract interpretation
is oblivious to both types of evasions. A comparison with two state-of-the-art
PDF malware detection tools shows that our conservative abstract interpretation
approach achieves similar accuracy, while being more resilient to evasion
attacks.

parabolic flat connections such that the residue is nilpotent with respect to
the parabolic reduction at each marked point. We construct an equivalence
between the bounded derived category
$D^{b}(\text{Qcoh}({\mathcal{L}oc_{n,P}^{0}}))$ of quasi-coherent sheaves on an

DARKMENTION generates and submits warnings to a Security Operations Center

sediments and nutrients in rivers, constituents that can smother biota and
cause eutrophication. However, the physical and economic constraints of manual
sampling prohibit data collection at the frequency required to capture
adequately the variation in concentrations through time. Here, we developed
models to predict total suspended solids (TSS) and oxidized nitrogen (NOx)
concentrations based on high-frequency time series of turbidity, conductivity
and river level data from low-cost in situ sensors in rivers flowing into the
Great Barrier Reef lagoon. We fit generalized least squares linear mixed
effects models with a continuous first-order autoregressive correlation to data
collected traditionally by manual sampling for subsequent analysis in the
laboratory, then used these models to predict TSS or NOx from in situ sensor
water-quality surrogate data, at two freshwater sites and one estuarine site.
These models accounted for both temporal autocorrelation and unevenly
time-spaced observations in the data. Turbidity proved a useful surrogate of
TSS, with high predictive ability at both freshwater and estuarine sites. NOx
models had much poorer fits, even when additional covariates of conductivity
and river level were included along with turbidity. Furthermore, the relative
influence of covariates in the NOx models was not consistent across sites. Our
findings likely reflect the complexity of dissolved nutrient dynamics in
rivers, which are influenced by multiple and interacting factors including
physical, chemical and biological processes, and the need for greater and
better incorporation of spatial and temporal components within models.

Typically, this is achieved by utilizing either a parameter that is

former approach is power consuming while the latter has two major deficiencies:
it has high insertion losses and the outgoing signal is harvested in a

its wide applicability in a variety of data mining tasks, especially for tasks

extracted from the heterogeneous networks, providing abundant semantic
knowledge. Though a variety of meta-paths can be defined, too many meta-paths
are redundant. Reduction on the number of meta-paths can enhance the
effectiveness since some redundant meta-paths provide interferential linkage to
the task. Moreover, the reduced meta-paths can reflect the characteristic of
the heterogeneous network. Previous endeavors try to reduce the number of

supervised information is expensive and may not always be available. In this
paper, we propose a novel algorithm, SPMR (Semantic Preserving Meta-path

setting. The proposed method is able to evaluate a set of meta-paths to
maximally preserve the semantics of original meta-paths after reduction.
Experimental results show that SPMR can select a succinct subset of meta-paths
which can achieve comparable or even better performance with fewer meta-paths.

is defined as the sum of soft X-ray peak fluxes of flares produced in the AR

it is found that the 8-day flare index is well correlated with the mean and/or
fluctuation values of some magnetic parameters (with correlation coefficients

finding, we argue that the origin of the supercurrent generation is the
emergence of Dirac strings with $\pi$ flux inside. It appears if the Rashba
spin-orbit interaction is added to the BCS model due to its stabilization of
the spin-twisting itinerant motion of electrons. The $\pi$-flux Dirac string
generates the cyclotron motion without external magnetic field, and produces
topologically protected loop current. This can be also attributed to the
emergence of the $U(1)$ instanton of the Berry connection ${\bf A}^{\rm fic}=-{
\hbar \over {2e}} \nabla \chi$, ${\bf \varphi}^{\rm fic}={ \hbar \over {2e}}
\partial_t \chi$, where $\chi$ is an angular variable of period $2\pi$. The
phase of the macroscopic wave function for the Ginzburg-Landau theory or the
phase of the pair potential of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations is identified
as $\chi$. If it is treated as a phenomenological parameter, the
Ginzburg-Landau theory or the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations can be used
without modification. However, the new origin requires the Rashba interaction
for the occurrence of superconductivity. This may explain the fact that ideal
metals like sodium does not show superconductivity since the screening of the

various edge features but also filtering tissue-dependent complex speckle

using a phase congruence-based edge significance measure called phase asymmetry
(PAS), which is invariant to the intensity amplitude of edges and takes 0 in
non-edge smooth regions and 1 at the idea step edge, while also taking
intermediate values at slowly varying ramp edges. By leveraging the PAS metric
in designing weighting coefficients to maintain a balance between
fractional-order anisotropic diffusion and total variation (TV) filters in TV
cost function, we propose a new fractional TV framework to not only achieve the
best despeckling performance with ramp edge preservation but also reduce the
staircase effect produced by integral-order filters. Then, we exploit the PAS
metric in designing a new fractional-order diffusion coefficient to properly
preserve low-contrast edges in diffusion filtering. Finally, different from
fixed fractional-order diffusion filters, an adaptive fractional order is
introduced based on the PAS metric to enhance various weak edges in the
spatially transitional areas between objects. The proposed fractional TV model
is minimized using the gradient descent method to obtain the final denoised
image. The experimental results and real application of ultrasound breast image
segmentation show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art
ultrasound despeckling filters for both speckle reduction and feature
preservation in terms of visual evaluation and quantitative indices.

map is required for the special case of no initial correlations. The same maps
describe the dynamics of any system-environment state obtained from the initial
state by a local operation on the system. The reduction of the system dynamics
to a set of completely positive maps allows known numerical and analytic tools
for uncorrelated initial states to be applied to the general case of initially
correlated states, which we exemplify by solving the qubit dephasing model for
such states, and provides a natural approach to quantum Markovianity for this

machine learning. Despite its significant progress in recent years, there are
still two challenging issues in the current ensemble clustering research.
First, most of the existing algorithms tend to investigate the ensemble
information at the object-level, yet often lack the ability to explore the rich
information at higher levels of granularity. Second, they mostly focus on the
direct connections (e.g., direct intersection or pair-wise co-occurrence) in
the multiple base clusterings, but generally neglect the multi-scale indirect
relationship hidden in them. To address these two issues, this paper presents a
novel ensemble clustering approach based on fast propagation of cluster-wise
similarities via random walks. We first construct a cluster similarity graph
with the base clusters treated as graph nodes and the cluster-wise Jaccard
coefficient exploited to compute the initial edge weights. Upon the constructed
graph, a transition probability matrix is defined, based on which the random
walk process is conducted to propagate the graph structural information.
Specifically, by investigating the propagating trajectories starting from
different nodes, a new cluster-wise similarity matrix can be derived by
considering the trajectory relationship. Then, the newly obtained cluster-wise
similarity matrix is mapped from the cluster-level to the object-level to
achieve an enhanced co-association (ECA) matrix, which is able to
simultaneously capture the object-wise co-occurrence relationship as well as
the multi-scale cluster-wise relationship in ensembles. Finally, two novel
consensus functions are proposed to obtain the consensus clustering result.
Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets have demonstrated the
effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

decrease of the modulation frequency for a given small modulation amplitude,
while is shrunk with decrease of the modulation frequency for a given large

the Zak phase in 1D systems, the Chern number in 2D systems and the Weyl points
or nodal lines in the systems with higher dimensions. It would be fantastic to
find the connection of different topology in different dimensions from one
simple model and reveal the deep physical picture behind them. In this work, we
propose a new model which starts from a binary-layered 1D photonic crystal, and
by introducing synthetic dimensions the topology of higher dimension systems
could appear. From this model, we find that the topology of band gap and the
Chern number of the 2D systems can be predicted by the parity-switching types
and the Zak phases of the 1D systems with spatial inversion symmetry(SIS),
respectively. The chiral edge state is confirmed by the winding number of the
reflection phase in the topological nontrivial gap. Different types of the
topological transition in higher dimensions are found, where two bands
degenerated as Weyl point or nodal line. Surprisingly, we find that the
topological connection between different dimensions and the topological
transition types in this model can be explained by the evolving of two
singularities which give rise to nonzero Zak phase of the 1D systems with SIS.
When transporting one singularity between adjacent bands, the Weyl point takes
the role as the instantaneous jumping channel of the singularity in the
parameter space, and then both the Zak phases of 1D systems with SIS and the
Chern number of 2D systems are changed. While both singularities moves to
band-gap edges from two adjacent bands, they will merge into the nodal line.
The theory for such model is also constructed. We propose that such topology
connection between different dimensions could be quite universal for other
systems.

properties of exemplary monolayer materials (MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$ and WSe$_2$).
The exciton dimensionality parametrizes the processes that underlie confinement
and many-body Coulomb effects as well as substrate screening effects, which
simplifies the analysis of electro-optical properties in low dimensional
systems. This study highlights the potential of theoretical models as valuable
tools for interpreting the optical spectrum and in seeking an understanding of
the correlated dynamics between the $A$ and $B$ excitons on the dielectric
function of TMDCs.

is very efficient since there are no complex operation involved and easy to be

Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method yields competitive or even
better results comparing to state-of-the-art image fusion methods both in terms
of visual quality and objective evaluation metrics. Furthermore, the proposed

We present analytical expressions for all components of the frequency- and
wave-vector-dependent charge-spin linear-response tensor of Weyl fermions. The
spin-momentum locking of the Weyl Hamiltonian leads to a coupling between
charge and longitudinal spin fluctuations, while transverse spin fluctuations
remain decoupled from the charge. A real Weyl semimetal with multiple Weyl
nodes can show this charge-spin coupling in equilibrium if its crystal symmetry
is sufficiently low. All Weyl semimetals are expected to show this coupling if
they are driven into a non-equilibrium stationary state with different
occupations of Weyl nodes, for example by exploiting the chiral anomaly. Based
on the response tensor, we investigate the low-energy collective excitations of
interacting Weyl fermions. For a local Hubbard interaction, the charge-spin
coupling leads to a dramatic change of the zero-sound dispersion: its velocity
becomes independent of the interaction strength and the chemical potential and
is given solely by the Fermi velocity. In the presence of long-range Coulomb
interactions, the coupling transforms the plasmon modes into spin plasmons. For
real Weyl semimetals with multiple Weyl nodes, the collective modes are
strongly affected by the presence of parallel static electric and magnetic
fields, due to the chiral anomaly. In particular, the zero-sound frequency at
fixed momentum and the spin content of the spin plasmons go through cusp
singularities as the chemical potential of one of the Weyl cones is tuned
through the Weyl node. We discuss possible experiments that could provide
smoking-gun evidence for Weyl physics.

realization of a quantum fluid of light. Under coherent optical drive,
remarkable effects such as superfluidity, dark solitons or the nucleation of

as a specific manifestation of collective excitations forming on top of the

experiment to measure their dispersion relation $\omega(\mathbf{k})$ directly.
The result, such as a speed of sound which is apparently twice too low, cannot
be explained upon considering the polariton condensate alone. In a combined
theoretical and experimental analysis, we demonstrate that the presence of a
reservoir of long-lived excitons interacting with polaritons has a dramatic
influence on the nature and characteristic of the quantum fluid, and that it

regarded as a challenge for computer vision algorithms. One proposed solution
to the challenges induced by rain and snowfall is to artificially remove the
rain from images or video using rain removal algorithms. It is the promise of
these algorithms that the rain-removed image frames will improve the
performance of subsequent segmentation and tracking algorithms. However, rain
removal algorithms are typically evaluated on their ability to remove synthetic
rain on a small subset of images. Currently, their behavior is unknown on
real-world videos when integrated with a typical computer vision pipeline. In
this paper, we review the existing rain removal algorithms and propose a new
dataset that consists of 22 traffic surveillance sequences under a broad
variety of weather conditions that all include either rain or snowfall. We
propose a new evaluation protocol that evaluates the rain removal algorithms on
their ability to improve the performance of subsequent segmentation, instance
segmentation, and feature tracking algorithms under rain and snow. If
successful, the de-rained frames of a rain removal algorithm should improve
segmentation performance and increase the number of accurately tracked
features. The results show that a recent single-frame-based rain removal
algorithm increases the segmentation performance by 19.7% on our proposed

beyond which it vanishes. While the spatial correlations far from the edge,

from geological reservoirs in sedimentary rocks to deformation zones, in folds,
faults, and shear zones. These rough surfaces play a major role in the
dissolution of rocks around stressed contacts, the transport of dissolved
material and the precipitation in surrounding pores. Consequently, they play an
active role in the evolution of rock microstructures and rheological properties
in the Earth's crust. They are observed individually or in networks, in
proximity to fractures and joints, and in numerous geological settings. This
review article deals with their geometrical and compositional characteristics
and the factors leading to their genesis. The main questions this review
focuses on are the following: How do they form? How can they be used to measure
strain and formation stress? How do they control fluid flow in the upper crust?
Geometrically, stylolites have fractal roughness, with fractal geometrical
properties exhibiting typically three scaling regimes: a self-affine scaling
with Hurst exponent 1.1+/-0.1 at small scale (up to tens or hundreds of
microns), another one with Hurst exponent around 0.5 to 0.6 at intermediate
scale (up to millimeters or centimeters), and in the case of sedimentary
stylolites, a flat scaling at large scale. More complicated anisotropic scaling
(scaling laws depending of the direction of the profile considered) is found in
the case of tectonic stylolites. We report models based on first principles
from physical chemistry and statistical physics, including a mechanical
component for the free-energy associated with stress concentrations, and a
precise tracking of the influence of grain-scale heterogeneities and disorder
on the resulting (micro)structures. Experimental efforts to reproduce
stylolites in the laboratory are also reviewed. We show that although
micrometer-size stylolite teeth are obtained in laboratory experiments, teeth
deforming numerous grains have not yet been obtained experimentally, which is
understandable given the very long formation time of such geometries. Finally,
the applications of stylolites as strain and stress markers, to determine
paleostress magnitude are reviewed. We show that the scalings in stylolite
heights and the crossover scale between these scalings can be used to determine
the stress magnitude (its scalar value) perpendicular to the stylolite surface
during the stylolite formation, and that the stress anisotropy in the stylolite
plane can be determined for the case of tectonic stylolites. We also show that
the crossover between medium (millimetric) scales and large (pluricentimetric)
scales, in the case of sedimentary stylolites, provides a good marker for the
total amount of dissolution, which is still valid even when the largest teeth
start to dissolve -- which leads to the loss of information, since the total
deformation is not anymore recorded in a single marker structure. We discuss
the impact of the stylolites on the evolution of the transport properties of
the hosting rock, and show that they promote a permeability increase parallel
to the stylolites, whereas their effect on the permeability transverse to the
stylolite can be negligible, or may reduce the permeability, depending on the
development of the stylolite.
  Highlights: Stylolite formation depends on rock composition and structure,
stress and fluids. Stylolite geometry, fractal and self-affine properties,
network structure, are investigated. The experiments and physics-based
numerical models for their formation are reviewed. Stylolites can be used as
markers of strain, paleostress orientation and magnitude. Stylolites impact
transport properties, as function of maturity and flow direction.

several areas for example signal processing, statistics, data analysis and
computational neuroscience. It is equivalent to Waring's problem for
homogeneous polynomials, that is to write a homogeneous polynomial in n
variables of degree D as a sum of D-th powers of linear forms, using the
minimal number of summands. This minimal number is called the rank of the
polynomial/tensor. We focus on decomposing binary forms, a problem that
corresponds to the decomposition of symmetric tensors of dimension 2 and order
D. Under this formulation, the problem finds its roots in invariant theory
where the decompositions are known as canonical forms. In this context many
different algorithms were proposed. We introduce a superfast algorithm that
improves the previous approaches with results from structured linear algebra.
It achieves a softly linear arithmetic complexity bound. To the best of our
knowledge, the previously known algorithms have at least quadratic complexity
bounds. Our algorithm computes a symbolic decomposition in $O(M(D) log(D))$
arithmetic operations, where $M(D)$ is the complexity of multiplying two
polynomials of degree D. It is deterministic when the decomposition is unique.
When the decomposition is not unique, our algorithm is randomized. We present a
Monte Carlo version of it and we show how to modify it to a Las Vegas one,
within the same complexity. From the symbolic decomposition, we approximate the
terms of the decomposition with an error of $2^{--$\epsilon$}$ , in $O(D
log^2(D) (log^2(D) + log($\epsilon$)))$ arithmetic operations. We use results
from Kaltofen and Yagati (1989) to bound the size of the representation of the
coefficients involved in the decomposition and we bound the algebraic degree of
the problem by min(rank, D -- rank + 1). We show that this bound can be tight.
When the input polynomial has integer coefficients, our algorithm performs, up
to poly-logarithmic factors, $O\_{bit} (D{\ell} + D^4 + D^3 $\tau$)$ bit

  Software-intensive Products: An Industrial Case Study",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Numerous software companies are adopting value-based decision making.
However, what does value mean for key stakeholders making decisions? How do
different stakeholder groups understand value? Without an explicit
understanding of what value means, decisions are subject to ambiguity and
vagueness, which are likely to bias them. This case study provides an in-depth
analysis of key stakeholders' value propositions when selecting features for a
large telecommunications company's software-intensive product. Stakeholders'
value propositions were elicited via interviews, which were analyzed using
Grounded Theory coding techniques (open and selective coding). Thirty-six value
propositions were identified and classified into six dimensions: customer
value, market competitiveness, economic value/profitability, cost efficiency,
technology & architecture, and company strategy. Our results show that although
propositions in the customer value dimension were those mentioned the most, the
concept of value for feature selection encompasses a wide range of value
propositions. Moreover, stakeholder groups focused on different and
complementary value dimensions, calling to the importance of involving all key
stakeholders in the decision making process. Although our results are
particularly relevant to companies similar to the one described herein, they
aim to generate a learning process on value-based feature selection for
practitioners and researchers in general.

serve as information shortcut tunnels which link their start and end characters
directly. Gated units are used to control the contribution of multiple input
links. Through formula derivation and comparison, we show that the lattice LSTM
is an extension of the standard LSTM with the ability to take multiple inputs.
Previous lattice LSTM model takes word embeddings as the lexicon input, we
prove that subword encoding can give the comparable performance and has the
benefit of not relying on any external segmentor. The contribution of lattice
LSTM comes from both lexicon and pretrained embeddings information, we find
that the lexicon information contributes more than the pretrained embeddings
information through controlled experiments. Our experiments show that the
lattice structure with subword encoding gives competitive or better results
with previous state-of-the-art methods on four segmentation benchmarks.
Detailed analyses are conducted to compare the performance of word encoding and

the classification of topological insulators is known to be given by the
$K$-theory in the momentum space, computation of the $K$-theory has been a
difficult task in the presence of complicated crystallographic symmetry. Here
we consider the $K$-homology in the real space for this problem, instead of the
$K$-theory in the momentum space, both of which give the same topological
classification. We apply the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS) for
computation of the $K$-homology, which is a mathematical tool for generalized

classification of higher-order topological insulators at the same time. By
solving the group extension problem in the AHSS on the basis of physical
arguments, we completely determine possible topological phases including
higher-order ones for each point group. Relationships among different
higher-order topological phases are argued in terms of the AHSS in the
$K$-homology. We find that in some nonmagnetic and magnetic point groups, a
stack of two $\mathbb{Z}_2$ second-order topological insulators can be smoothly

discussed. There are three types of regions in the $\theta-C$ plane that
correspond to domains where either solitary waves cannot exist, are organized
in branches, or have a continuous spectrum. A numerical method valid for the
two latter cases, that rigorously proves the existence of the waves, is
presented and used to locate many waves, including bright and dark structures.
Some of them belong to parametric domains where solitary waves were not found

first performing a linear analysis of the background plasma state and second by
means of numerical simulations. They show that the cores of some waves can be
robust but, for the parameters considered in the analysis, the tails are
unstable. The substitution of the double adiabatic model by evolution equations
for the plasma pressures appears to suppress the instability in some cases and
to allow the propagation of the solitary waves during long times.

Planck mass relics. This requires the potential to have a shallow local
minimum, not just a critical point. The initial PBH mass is then below $10^6$
g, and predictions for the CMB observables are the same as in tree-level Higgs
inflation, $n_s=0.96$ and $r=5\times10^{-3}$ (metric) or $r=4\times 10^{-8}

  high-dimensional multivariate linear regression",,,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Variable selection is essential for improving inference and interpretation in
multivariate linear regression. Although a number of alternative regressor
selection criteria have been suggested, the most prominent and widely used are
the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC),
Mallow's $C_p$, and their modifications. However, for high-dimensional data,
experience has shown that the performance of these classical criteria is not
always satisfactory. In the present article, we begin by presenting the
necessary and sufficient conditions (NSC) for the strong consistency of the
high-dimensional AIC, BIC, and $C_p$, based on which we can identify some
reasons for their poor performance. Specifically, we show that under certain
mild high-dimensional conditions, if the BIC is strongly consistent, then the
AIC is strongly consistent, but not vice versa. This result contradicts the
classical understanding. In addition, we consider some NSC for the strong
consistency of the high-dimensional kick-one-out (KOO) methods introduced by
Zhao et al. (1986) and Nishii et al. (1988). Furthermore, we propose two
general methods based on the KOO methods and prove their strong consistency.
The proposed general methods remove the penalties while simultaneously reducing
the conditions for the dimensions and sizes of the regressors. A simulation
study supports our consistency conclusions and shows that the convergence rates
of the two proposed general KOO methods are much faster than those of the
original methods.

acceleration-controlled vehicles, i.e. how input disturbances affect the
distributed system for very long chains. There exist variants of string
stability, like avoiding that a local disturbance gets amplified along the
chain, or more strongly ensuring that the output vector's p-norm remains
bounded for any bounded vector of input disturbances independently of the
string length. They are all impossible to achieve with any linear controller if
the vehicles only use relative information of few vehicles in front. Previous
work has shown that adding absolute velocity into the controller, allows to at
least avoid amplification of a local disturbance. In this paper, we consider
the stronger definitions of string stability, under this same relaxation of
using absolute velocity in the controller. We prove that the influence from
input vector to output vector cannot be bounded independently of chain length
in the most popular 2-norm sense, with any bounded stabilizing linear
controller; while a proportional derivative (PD) controller can guarantee it in
the practically relevant infinity-norm sense. Moreover, we identify the
disturbance acting on the leader as the main issue for string stability.

and gradually typed language with let-polymorphism, and develop a sound and
complete inference algorithm for it. Soundness and completeness mean that, if
the algorithm succeeds, the input term can be translated to a well-typed term
of an explicitly typed blame calculus by cast insertion and vice versa.
However, in general, there are many possible translations depending on how type
variables that were left undecided by static type inference are instantiated
with concrete static types. Worse, the translated terms may behave
differently---some evaluate to values but others raise blame.
  In this paper, we propose and formalize a new blame calculus
$\lambda^{\textsf{DTI}}_{\textsf{B}}$ that avoids such divergence as an
intermediate language for the ITGL. A main idea is to allow a term to contain
type variables (that have not been instantiated during static type inference)
and defer instantiation of these type variables to run time. We introduce
dynamic type inference (DTI) into the semantics of
$\lambda^{\textsf{DTI}}_{\textsf{B}}$ so that type variables are instantiated
along reduction. The DTI-based semantics not only avoids the divergence
described above but also is sound and complete with respect to the semantics of
fully instantiated terms in the following sense: if the evaluation of a term
succeeds (i.e., terminates with a value) in the DTI-based semantics, then there
is a fully instantiated version of the term that also succeeds in the
explicitly typed blame calculus and vice versa.
  Finally, we prove the gradual guarantee, which is an important correctness
criterion of a gradually typed language, for the ITGL.

networks is introduced and analyzed using branching-process methods. The model
generalizes that of [Gleeson et al., Phys.Rev. X., 2016] in two ways. First,
even for a monoplex (single-layer) network, the model is defined for any
specific network defined by its adjacency matrix, instead of being restricted
to an ensemble of random networks. Second, a multiplex version of the model is
introduced to capture the behaviour of users who post information from one
social media platform to another. In both cases the branching process analysis
demonstrates that the dynamical system is, in the limit of low innovation,
poised near a critical point, which is known to lead to heavy-tailed
distributions of meme popularity similar to those observed in empirical data.

Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) when the Zeeman energy is modulated around a

number of modulation quanta. They constitute the atomic counterpart of Shapiro
resonances observed in microwave-driven superconducting Josephson junctions.
The population dynamics near each resonance corresponds to slow and non-linear
secular oscillations on top of a rapid `micromotion'. At long times and in a
narrow window of modulation frequencies around each resonance, we observe a
relaxation to asymptotic states that are unstable without drive. These
stationary states correspond to phase-locked solutions of the Josephson
equations generalized to include dissipation, and are analogous to the
stationary states of driven superconducting junctions. We find that dissipation
is essential to understand this long-time behavior, and we propose a
phenomenological model to explain quantitatively the experimental results.
Finally, we demonstrate hysteresis in the asymptotic state of the driven spinor
BEC when sweeping the modulation frequency across a Shapiro resonance.

flares, the position centroids exhibit clockwise looped motion on the sky, on
scales of typically 150 micro-arcseconds over a few tens of minutes,
corresponding to about 30% the speed of light. At the same time, the flares
exhibit continuous rotation of the polarization angle, with about the same
45(+/-15)-minute period as that of the centroid motions. Modelling with
relativistic ray tracing shows that these findings are all consistent with a
near face-on, circular orbit of a compact polarized 'hot spot' of infrared
synchrotron emission at approximately six to ten times the gravitational radius
of a black hole of 4 million solar masses. This corresponds to the region just
outside the innermost, stable, prograde circular orbit (ISCO) of a

Understanding human casual responsibility is particularly important when
intelligent autonomous systems can harm people, as with autonomous vehicles or,
most notably, with autonomous weapon systems (AWS). Using Information Theory,
we develop a responsibility quantification (ResQu) model of human involvement
in intelligent automated systems and demonstrate its applications on decisions
regarding AWS. The analysis reveals that human comparative responsibility to
outcomes is often low, even when major functions are allocated to the human.
Thus, broadly stated policies of keeping humans in the loop and having
meaningful human control are misleading and cannot truly direct decisions on
how to involve humans in intelligent systems and advanced automation. The
current model is an initial step in the complex goal to create a comprehensive
responsibility model, that will enable quantification of human causal
responsibility. It assumes stationarity, full knowledge regarding the
characteristic of the human and automation and ignores temporal aspects.
Despite these limitations, it can aid in the analysis of systems designs
alternatives and policy decisions regarding human responsibility in intelligent

level, i.e. whether authors with alphabetically earlier surnames result as
being more cited. Examining the question at both the overall and discipline
levels, the analysis finds no evidence whatsoever that alphabetically earlier
surnames gain advantage. The same lack of evidence occurs for the subpopulation
of scientists with very high publication rates, where alphabetical advantage
might gain more ground. The field of observation consists of 14,467 scientists

without and with inertia effects, both analytically and numerically. The model
equation represents the physical behavior of a harmonic oscillator in two or

both rotational and deformational components. This simple model plays pivotal
roles in understanding more complicated processes. The presented analytical
solution serves as a test of numerical integration schemes, its derivation is
presented in a fashion that allows to be repeated directly in a classroom.
While the results in the absence of fields (equilibrium) or confinement (free
particle) are omnipresent in the literature, we write down, apparently for the
first time, the full nonequilibrium results that may correspond, e.g., to a
Hookean dumbbell embedded in a macroscopically homogeneous shear or mixed flow
field. We demonstrate how the inertia results reduce to their noninertia
counterparts in the nontrivial limit of vanishing mass. While the results are
derived using basic integrations over Dirac delta distributions, we mention its
relationship with alternative approaches involving (i) Fourier transforms, that
seems advantageous only if the measured quantities also reside in Fourier
space, and (ii) a Fokker--Planck equation and the moments of the probability
distribution. The results, verified by numerical experiments, provide
additional means of measuring the performance of numerical methods for such
systems. It should be emphasized that this manuscript provides specific details
regarding the derivations of the time correlation functions as well as the
implementations of various numerical methods, so that it can serve as a

experimentally studied in the case of a dilute suspension of Janus particles

distance is reached. We compute the phase diagram (activity versus interaction
length), showing that the interaction does not suppress this delocalization
phenomenon but induces a liquid- or solid-like structure in the densest
regions. Interestingly a reentrant behavior is observed: a first increase of
{\tau} from small values acts as an effective warming, favouring fluidization;
at higher values, when the delocalization occurs, a further increase of {\tau}
induces freezing inside the densest regions. An approximate analytical scheme

stochastic switching, are precluded from our analysis. To analyse the steady
state behaviour of reaction systems, even if the parameter values are changing,
necessitates a parameter-free approach, which has been central to algebraic
analysis in chemical reaction network theory. To identify suitable models we
use tools from real algebraic geometry that link the network structure to its
dynamical properties. We then make a connection to internal noise models and
show how power spectral methods can be used to predict stochastically driven
patterns in systems with coloured noise. In simple cases we show that the power
spectrum of the coloured noise process and the power spectrum of the

indicates a quite evident gap in favor of men over women. Beyond the
understanding of the factors that could be at the basis of this phenomenon, it
is worthwhile understanding if it would be appropriate to conduct the
evaluation per population in a manner distinguished by gender. In fact if there
is some factor that structurally determines a penalization of performance by
women researchers compared to men then the comparative evaluation of
organizations' performance that does not take gender into account will lead to
an advantage for those that employ more men, under parity in the capacities of
their staffs. In this work we measure the differences of the performance and
the rank of research institutions as observed when gender is taken into account
compared to when it is ignored. The study population consists of all Italian
universities and the performance measured in the hard sciences for the period
2006-2010.

Nevertheless, this model has seen very limited application to tomographic

J1825-137. We aim to constrain the mechanisms dominating the particle transport
within the nebula, accounting for its anomalously large size and spectral
characteristics. Methods: The nebula is studied using a deep exposure from over
12 years of H.E.S.S. I operation, together with data from H.E.S.S. II improving
the low energy sensitivity. Enhanced energy-dependent morphological and
spatially-resolved spectral analyses probe the Very High Energy (VHE, E > 0.1
TeV) gamma-ray properties of the nebula. Results: The nebula emission is
revealed to extend out to 1.5 degrees from the pulsar, ~1.5 times further than
previously seen, making HESS J1825--137, with an intrinsic diameter of ~100 pc,
potentially the largest gamma-ray PWN currently known. Characterisation of the
nebula's strongly energy-dependent morphology enables the particle transport
mechanisms to be constrained. A dependence of the nebula extent with energy of
R $\propto$ E^\alpha with \alpha = -0.29 +/- 0.04 (stat) +/- 0.05 (sys)
disfavours a pure diffusion scenario for particle transport within the nebula.
The total gamma-ray flux of the nebula above 1~TeV is found to be (1.12 +/-
0.03 (stat) +/- 0.25 (sys)) $\times 10^{-11}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, corresponding
to ~64% of the flux of the Crab Nebula. Conclusions: HESS J1825-137 is a PWN
with clear energy-dependent morphology at VHE gamma-ray energies. This source
is used as a laboratory to investigate particle transport within middle-aged
PWNe. Deep observations of this highly spatially-extended PWN enable a spectral
map of the region to be produced, providing insights into the spectral
variation within the nebula.

graphs where the shift matrix is generally symmetric. We show that while, in
this case, the shift matrix can be converted to satisfy the original
shift-enabled condition, the converted matrix is not associated with the
original graph, that is, it does not capture anymore the structure of the graph
signal. We show via a counterexample, that a non-shift-enabled matrix cannot be
converted to a shift-enabled one and still maintain the topological structure
of the underlying graph, which is necessary to facilitate localized signal
processing.

supra-linear trend of gold-based transistors. Moreover, short channel effects
are considerably suppressed in graphene electrodes devices. More specifically,

traditionally measured based on total emission, which doesn't reflect the
current activity of the central black hole. The increasing interest in compact
radio cores of AGNs requires determination of the RLF based on core emission
(i.e., core RLF). In this work we have established a large sample (totaling
1207) of radio-loud AGNs, mainly consisting of radio galaxies (RGs) and
steep-spectrum radio quasars (SSRQs). Based on the sample, we explore the
relationship between core luminosity ($L_c$) and total luminosity ($L_t$) via a
powerful statistical tool called ""Copula"". The conditional probability
distribution $p(\log L_{c} \mid \log L_{t})$ is obtained. We derive the core
RLF as a convolution of $p(\log L_{c} \mid \log L_{t})$ with the total RLF
which was determined by previous work. We relate the separate RG and SSRQ core
RLFs via a relativistic beaming model and find that SSRQs have an average
Lorentz factor of $\gamma=9.84_{-2.50}^{+3.61}$, and that most are seen within
$8^{\circ} \lesssim \theta \lesssim 45^{\circ}$ of the jet axis. Compared with
the total RLF which is mainly contributed by extended emission, the core RLF
shows a very weak luminosity-dependent evolution, with the number density
peaking around $z\thicksim 0.8$ for all luminosities. Differences between core
and total RLFs can be explained in a framework involving a combination of
density and luminosity evolutions where the cores have significantly weaker
luminosity evolution than the extended emission.

are provably robust to norm-bounded adversarial perturbations. Most of these
methods are based on minimizing an upper bound on the worst-case loss over all
possible adversarial perturbations. While these techniques show promise, they
often result in difficult optimization procedures that remain hard to scale to
larger networks. Through a comprehensive analysis, we show how a simple
bounding technique, interval bound propagation (IBP), can be exploited to train
large provably robust neural networks that beat the state-of-the-art in
verified accuracy. While the upper bound computed by IBP can be quite weak for
general networks, we demonstrate that an appropriate loss and clever
hyper-parameter schedule allow the network to adapt such that the IBP bound is
tight. This results in a fast and stable learning algorithm that outperforms
more sophisticated methods and achieves state-of-the-art results on MNIST,
CIFAR-10 and SVHN. It also allows us to train the largest model to be verified
beyond vacuous bounds on a downscaled version of ImageNet.

Despite the absence of magnetic Bragg scattering in phase II', its ordering
vector is revealed by the location of an intense magnetic soft mode at the

this mode softens and transforms into quasielastic and nearly Q-independent

linear Darcy model in the rock matrix and the non-linear Forchheimer model in
the fractures. In our formulation, we are able to reformulate the
matrix-fracture problem to only the fracture network problem and, therefore,
significantly reduce the computational cost. The resulting problem is then a
non-linear interface problem that can be solved using a fixed-point or
Newton-Krylov methods, which in each iteration require several solves of Robin
problems in the surrounding rock matrices. To achieve this, the flux exchange
(a linear Robin-to-Neumann co-dimensional mapping) between the porous medium
and the fracture network is done offline by pre-computing a multiscale flux
basis that consists of the flux response from each degree of freedom on the
fracture network. This delivers a conserve for the basis that handles the
solutions in the rock matrices for each degree of freedom in the fractures
pressure space. Then, any Robin sub-domain problems are replaced by linear
combinations of the multiscale flux basis during the interface iteration. The
proposed approach is, thus, agnostic to the physical model in the fracture

pre-computing the flux exchange between the porous medium and the fracture

proportionality is not an artifact of the one-box model and rigorously features
to a good approximation in more realistic, yet still analytically soluble

nearby dwarf Wolf-Rayet (WR) galaxies. The ages of the most recent starburst
events in these galaxies are found between 3 and 10 Myr. The gas-phase
metallicities [12+log(O/H)] for the spatially-resolved star-forming regions are
derived using several indicators. The star-forming regions within the galaxies
are found chemically homogeneous within the uncertainties in the estimates.
Nitrogen-enrichment as expected in the WR regions is not detected. This implies
that metal-enrichment due to supernovae explosions in the most recent
star-forming episode is not being detected here. It is suggested that the newly
synthesized metals still reside in hot gas-phase. The metals from the previous
episodes, cooled by now and well mixed across the whole extent of galaxies, are
making galaxies chemically homogeneous with normal N/O ratio. These galaxies
are residing in dense environments with galaxy density in the range of $8-80$
Mpc$^{-3}$.

regularization in order to limit the search space to reasonable solutions. A
majority of segmentation methods integrates these regularization terms in one
way or the other in an energy functional using a balancing term. The tuning of
this parameter that either favours more the regularization or the data
conformity is critical and, unfortunately, the success of the optimization
process strongly depends on it. Often the optimal settings change from image to
image. In this paper we propose a novel general framework based on an adaptive
eigenspace that was first proposed for solving inverse problems. The resulting
method proves accurate and yields robust results, without the need for
optimization techniques or being sensitive to the parameter choice. In fact,
the method solves a symmetric positive definite sparse system and hence, uses
only a fraction of the computational cost. The method is very versatile and
does not need parameter-tuning, when segmenting objects from any kind of an
image or when segmenting different organs. As the adaptive eigenspace is
determined directly from the image to segment, the approach also does not need
a tedious training phase.

The nonlinear system is linearized using an input-output linearization

integer order PID controller, a fractional PID controller, and a SIMC PID
controller. The robustness analysis of the proposed controllers is based on a
factorial experimental design. The input factors for the experiment are the
uncertainty in gains of the plant, the presence of random noise in the feedback
loop, and the existence of external perturbations. The outputs of the
experiment measure the performance of each controller through the time step
response and the control action of each controller using the mean value and the
standard deviation. The obtained results show that the fractional order PID

Dilemma or the Hawk-Dove game. Selection operates at two organization levels:
individuals compete with peer group members based on individual payoff, while
groups also compete with other groups based on average payoff of group members.
In the Prisoner's Dilemma, this creates a tension between the two levels of
selection, as defectors are favored at the individual level, whereas groups
with at least some cooperators outperform groups of defectors at the
between-group level. In the limit of infinite group size and infinite number of
groups, we derive a non-local PDE that describes the probability distribution
of group compositions in the population. For special families of payoff
matrices, we characterize the long-time behavior of solutions of our equation,
finding a threshold level of between-group selection required to sustain
density steady states and the survival of cooperation. When all-cooperator
groups are most fit, the average and most abundant group composition at steady
state range from featuring all-defector groups when individual-level selection
dominates to featuring all-cooperator groups when group-level selection
dominates. When the most fit groups have a mix of cooperators and defectors,
then the average and most abundant group compositions always feature a smaller
fraction of cooperators than required for the optimal mix, even in the limit
where group-level selection is infinitely stronger than individual-level
selection. In such cases, the conflict between the two levels of selection
cannot be decoupled, and cooperation cannot be sustained at all in the case
when between-group competition favors an even mix of cooperators and defectors.

framework called PICO is widely used, which identifies the sentences in a given
medical text that belong to the four components typically reported in clinical
trials: Participants/Problem (P), Intervention (I), Comparison (C) and Outcome
(O). In this work, we propose a novel deep learning model for recognizing PICO
elements in biomedical abstracts. Based on the previous state-of-the-art
bidirectional long-short term memory (biLSTM) plus conditional random field
(CRF) architecture, we add another layer of biLSTM upon the sentence
representation vectors so that the contextual information from surrounding
sentences can be gathered to help infer the interpretation of the current one.
In addition, we propose two methods to further generalize and improve the
model: adversarial training and unsupervised pre-training over large corpora.
We tested our proposed approach over two benchmark datasets. One is the
PubMed-PICO dataset, where our best results outperform the previous best by
5.5%, 7.9%, and 5.8% for P, I, and O elements in terms of F1 score,
respectively. And for the other dataset named NICTA-PIBOSO, the improvements
for P/I/O elements are 2.4%, 13.6%, and 1.0% in F1 score, respectively.
Overall, our proposed deep learning model can obtain unprecedented PICO element
detection accuracy while avoiding the need for any manual feature selection.

effects on the functioning of gene regulatory networks (GRN). The Master
equation (ME) provides a theoretical basis for studying such effects. However,
solving the ME can be a task that ranges from simple to difficult to impossible
using conventional methods. Therefore, discovering new techniques for solving
the ME is an important part of research on stochastic GRN. In this paper, we
present a novel approach to obtaining the generating function (GF), which
contains the same information as the ME, for a one gene system that includes
multi-step post-transcription and post-translation processes. The novelty of
the approach lies in the separation of the mRNAs from proteins. The GF for the
mRNAs is obtained using a formalism involving operators and vector states.
Using the same formalism, the GF for the proteins is solved for a particular
path taken by all mRNAs in the time-copy number plane; then, the GF is summed
over all possible paths. We prove a theorem that shows the summation of all
paths to be equivalent to an equation similar to the ME for the mRNAs. On a
system with six gene products in total and randomly selected initial
conditions, we confirm the validity of our results by comparing them with
Gillespie simulations.

parallel, but to a much lesser extent. However, empirical evidence increasingly
suggests that characterizing a network with a unique pattern typology may be
too simplistic, since a system can integrate properties from distinct
organizations at different scales. Here, we explore the relationship between
some of those organizational patterns: two at the mesoscale (modularity and
in-block nestedness); and one at the macroscale (nestedness). We analytically
show that nestedness can be used to provide approximate bounds for modularity,
with exact results in an idealized scenario. Specifically, we show that
nestedness and modularity are antagonistic. Furthermore, we evince that
in-block nestedness provides a parsimonious transition between nested and
modular networks, taking properties of both. Far from a mere theoretical
exercise, understanding the boundaries that discriminate each architecture is
fundamental, to the extent modularity and nestedness are known to place heavy
constraints on the stability of several dynamical processes, specially in

(IC) design flow until desired printability and performance metrics are
achieved. This starts with placement optimization aimed at improving
routability, wirelength, congestion and timing in the design. Contrarily, no
such practice exists on a floorplanned layout, during the early stage of the
design flow. Recently, STAIRoute \cite{karb2} aimed to address that by
identifying the shortest routing path of a net through a set of routing regions
in the floorplan in multiple metal layers. Since the blocks in hierarchical
ASIC/SoC designs do not use all the permissible routing layers for the internal
routing corresponding to standard cell connectivity, the proposed STAIRoute
framework is not an effective for early global routability assessment. This
leads to improper utilization of routing area, specifically in higher routing
layers with fewer routing blockages, as the lack of placement of standard cells
does not facilitates any routing of their interconnections.
  This paper presents a generalized model for early global routability
assessment, HGR, by utilizing the free regions over the blocks beyond certain
metal layers. The proposed (hybrid) routing model comprises of (a) the junction
graph model in STAIRoute routing through the block boundary regions in lower
routing layers, and (ii) the grid graph model for routing in higher layers over
the free regions of the blocks.
  Experiment with the latest floorplanning benchmarks exhibit an average
reduction of $4\%$, $54\%$ and $70\%$ in netlength, via count, and congestion
respectively when HGR is used over STAIRoute. Further, we conducted another
experiment on an industrial design flow targeted for $45nm$ process, and the
results are encouraging with $~3$X runtime boost when early global routing is
used in conjunction with the existing physical design flow.

survey primarily targets the CMZ, we observe across the entire sightline
through the Milky Way. AGB stars are revealed by their signature of double
peaked 22 GHz water maser lines. They are distinguished by their spectral
signatures and their luminosities, which reach up to 10^-7 Lo. Higher
luminosities are usually associated with Young Stellar Objects located in CMZ
star forming regions. We detect a population of ~600 new water masers that can
likely be associated with AGB outflows.

pattern around matter overdensities in redshift space, appearing larger on
their near side and smaller on their far side. The opposite effect occurs for
galaxies around an underdense region. These patterns of apparent magnification
induce dipole and higher multipole terms in the cross-correlation of galaxy
number density fluctuations with galaxy size/brightness (which is sensitive to
the convergence field). This provides a means of directly measuring peculiar
velocity statistics at low and intermediate redshift, with several advantages
for performing cosmological tests of GR. In particular, it does not depend on
empirically-calibrated scaling relations like the Tully-Fisher and Fundamental
Plane methods. We show that the next generation of spectroscopic galaxy
redshift surveys will be able to measure the Doppler magnification effect with
sufficient signal-to-noise to test GR on large scales. We illustrate this with
forecasts for the constraints that can be achieved on parametrised deviations
from GR for forthcoming low-redshift galaxy surveys with DESI and SKA2.
Although the cross-correlation statistic considered has a lower signal to noise
than RSD, it will be a useful probe of GR since it is sensitive to different
systematics.

the research of blockchain technology has also shown growth. It has gradually
become a new generation of distributed, non-centralized and trust-based
technology solution. However, the blockchain operation is expensive and
transaction is delayed. Take BitCoin as an example. On the one hand, a block is
produced every ten minute. On the other hand, once the new block is generated,
it takes a certain time to propagate world wide. The slow speed of propagation
determines that BitCoin can not use too small block interval time. Ethereum
also faces similar problems, so the concept of uncle block was introduced to
reduce blockchain forks. This paper introduces a new tree structure based
broadcast propagation routing model, providing a novel method to organize

that the tree based routing can accelerate broadcast convergence time and

wave function of a two-particle correlated model atom with harmonic
interactions. From that wave function, the nonidempotent one-particle reduced
density matrix is deduced. Its diagonal gives the exact probability density,
the basic variable of Density-Functional Theory. The one-matrix is directly
decomposed, in a point-wise manner, in terms of natural orbitals and their
occupation numbers, i.e., in terms of its eigenvalues and normalized
eigenfunctions. The exact informations are used to fix three, approximate,
independent-particle models. Next, a time-dependent external field of finite
duration is added to the exact and approximate Hamiltonians and the resulting
Cauchy problem is solved. The impact of the external field is investigated by
calculating the energy shift generated by that time-dependent field. It is
found that the nonperturbative energy shift reflects the sign of the driving
field. The exact probability density and current are used, as inputs, to
investigate the capability of a formally exact independent-particle modeling in
time-dependent DFT as well. The results for the observable energy shift are
analyzed by using realistic estimations for the parameters of the two-particle
target and the external field. A comparison with the experimental prediction on
the sign-dependent energy loss of swift protons and antiprotons in a gaseous He

tremendous interest. They are of fundamental interest because of their

property makes topological insulators on one hand perfect materials for
optically generated, ultrafast spin-bunches spin-current sources for the
generation of THz radiation. On the other hand, those spin-polarized
surface-state currents when generated by a voltage lead to large spin Hall

the spin Nernst effect. Both mutually convert charge/ heat currents into
transverse spin currents leading to spin accumulations. By connecting both

intermediate-mass main sequence stars is still highly debated. Aims. We want to
bring observational constraints to a large population of intermediate-mass
pre-main sequence (PMS) stars in order to test the theory that
convective-dynamo fields generated during the PMS phases of stellar evolution
can occasionally relax into fossil fields on the main sequence. Methods. Using
distance estimations, photometric measurements, and spectropolarimetric data
from HARPSpol and ESPaDOnS of 38 intermediate-mass PMS stars, we determined
fundamental stellar parameters (Teff, L and v sin i) and measured surface
magnetic field characteristics (including detection limits for non-detections,
and longitudinal fields and basic topologies for positive detections). Using
PMS evolutionary models, we determined the mass, radius, and internal structure
of these stars. We compared different PMS models to check that our
determinations were not model-dependant. We then compared the magnetic
characteristics of our sample accounting for their stellar parameters and
internal structures. Results. We detect magnetic fields in about half of our
sample. About 90% of the magnetic stars have outer convective envelopes larger
than ~25% of the stellar radii, and heavier than ~2% of the stellar mass. Going
to higher mass, we find that the magnetic incidence in intermediate-mass stars
drops very quickly, within a time-scale of the order of few times 0.1 Myr.
Finally, we propose that intermediate-mass T Tauri stars with large convective
envelopes, close to the fully convective limit, have complex fields and that
their dipole component strengths may decrease as the sizes of their convective
envelopes decrease, similar to lower-mass T Tauri stars.

$d^{d+o(d)}$-approximate (pure) Nash equilibria in (proportional sharing)
weighted congestion games with polynomial cost functions of degree at most $d$.
This is an exponential improvement of the approximation factor with respect to
the previously best deterministic algorithm. An appealing additional feature of
the algorithm is that it only uses best-improvement steps in the actual game,
as opposed to the previously best algorithms, that first had to transform the
game itself. Our algorithm is an adaptation of the seminal algorithm by
Caragiannis et al. [FOCS'11, TEAC 2015], but we utilize an approximate
potential function directly on the original game instead of an exact one on a
modified game.
  A critical component of our analysis, which is of independent interest, is
the derivation of a novel bound of $[d/\mathcal{W}(d/\rho)]^{d+1}$ for the
Price of Anarchy (PoA) of $\rho$-approximate equilibria in weighted congestion
games, where $\mathcal{W}$ is the Lambert-W function. More specifically, we
show that this PoA is exactly equal to $\Phi_{d,\rho}^{d+1}$, where
$\Phi_{d,\rho}$ is the unique positive solution of the equation $\rho
(x+1)^d=x^{d+1}$. Our upper bound is derived via a smoothness-like argument,
and thus holds even for mixed Nash and correlated equilibria, while our lower
bound is simple enough to apply even to singleton congestion games.

over a set of parallel communication channels with possible packet dropout. Our
goal is to analytically describe intrinsic constraints among channel packet
dropout probabilities and the plant's characteristics, such as unstable poles,
non-minimum phase zeros in the mean-square stabilizability of the system. It
turns out that this is a very hard problem. Here, we focus on the case in which
the plant has relative degree one and each non-minimum zero of the plant is
only associated with one of control input channels. Then, the admissible region
of packet dropout probabilities in the mean-square stabilizability of the
system is obtained. Moreover, a set of hyper-rectangles in this region is
presented in terms of the plant's non-minimum phase zeros, unstable poles and
Wonham decomposition forms which is related to the structure of controllable
subspace of the plant. When the non-minimum phase zeros are void, it is found
that the supremum of packet dropout probabilities' product in the admissible
region is determined by the product of plant's unstable poles only. A numerical
example is presented to illustrate the fundamental constraints in the

employs a voting-based scheme that leverages the estimated uncertainty of the
individual classifiers in their predictions to measure the novelty of a new

depend on the specific number of nodes and links. These limits are given by
families of singular configurations that we name as ultra-short and ultra-long

channels is a fundamental yet practical problem in many machine vision
applications such as robot grasping and autonomous driving. In this paper, we
address this problem by developing a Cross-Modal Attentional Context (CMAC)
learning framework, which enables the full exploitation of the context
information from both RGB and depth data. Compared to existing RGB-D object
detection frameworks, our approach has several appealing properties. First, it
consists of an attention-based global context model for exploiting adaptive
contextual information and incorporating this information into a region-based
CNN (e.g., Fast RCNN) framework to achieve improved object detection
performance. Second, our CMAC framework further contains a fine-grained object
part attention module to harness multiple discriminative object parts inside
each possible object region for superior local feature representation. While
greatly improving the accuracy of RGB-D object detection, the effective
cross-modal information fusion as well as attentional context modeling in our
proposed model provide an interpretable visualization scheme. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves upon the
state of the art on all public benchmarks.

  momentum of leptons","Revised arguments in Conclusions; Discussion section added; results
  unchanged",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is commonly assumed that a charged particle does not accelerate linearly
along a spatially uniform magnetic field. We show that this is no longer the
case if the interaction of the particle with the quantum vacuum is chiral, in
which case parity and time-reversal symmetries are simultaneously broken. In
particular, this is the situation of an electroweak interacting particle in the
presence of a uniform magnetic field. We demonstrate first that, in a spatially
uniform and adiabatically time-varying magnetic field, a proton coupled to the
leptonic vacuum acquires a kinetic momentum antiparallel to the magnetic field,
whereas virtual leptons gain an equivalent Casimir momentum in the opposite
direction. Remarkably, leptons remain virtual throughout the process, which
means that the proton acceleration is not caused by the recoil associated to
the emission of any actual particle. The kinetic energy of the proton is part
of its electroweak self-energy, which is provided by the source of magnetic
field. In addition we find that, in a constant and uniform magnetic field, the
adiabatic spin-relaxation of a single proton is accompanied by its acceleration
along the magnetic field. We estimate that, at the end of the spin-polarization
process, the proton reaches a velocity of the order of $\mu$m/s. The latter
finding may lie within the scope of experimental observations.

algorithms for simultaneous online estimation of contact and aerodynamic

for discriminating between aerodynamic and interaction forces. The first
technique is based on aerodynamic and contact torque models, and uses the
external force to estimate wind speed. Contacts are then detected based on the
residual between estimated external torque and expected (modeled) aerodynamic
torque. Upon detecting contact, wind speed is assumed to change very slowly.
From the estimated interaction wrench, we are also able to determine the
contact location. This is embedded into a particle filter framework to further
improve contact location estimation. The second algorithm uses the propeller
aerodynamic power and angular speed as measured by the speed controllers to
obtain an estimate of the airspeed. An aerodynamics model is then used to
determine the aerodynamic wrench. Both methods rely on accurate aerodynamics
models. Therefore, we evaluate data-driven and physics based models as well as
offline system identification for flying robots. For obtaining ground truth
data we performed autonomous flights in a 3D wind tunnel. Using this data,
aerodynamic model selection, parameter identification, and discrimination
between aerodynamic and contact forces could be done. Finally, the developed

on the averaging of the deterministic governing equations with the stochastic

demonstrated that the moment equations accurately predict the uncertainty for
problems whose Eulerian dynamics are either governed by the linear advection

different applications while maximizing the throughput. C2TCP works on top of
classic throughput-oriented TCP and accommodates various target delays without

fluid dynamics within the framework of kinetic field theory (KFT). The main
application we have in mind is cosmic structure formation where gaseous
components need to be gravitationally coupled to dark matter. However, we
expect that the fluid model is much more widely applicable. The idea behind the
effective model is similar to that of smoothed particle hydrodynamics. By
introducing mesoscopic particles equipped with a position, a momentum, and an
enthalpy, we construct a free theory for such particles and derive suitable
interaction operators. We then show that the model indeed leads to the correct
macroscopic evolution equations, namely the continuity, Euler, Navier-Stokes,
and energy conservation equations of both ideal and viscous hydrodynamics.

one (MDO) fermionic field plus the standard matter fields is considered. After
a primordial quantum fluctuation the field slowly rolls down to the bottom of a
symmetry breaking potential, driving the Universe to an inflationary regime
that increases the scale factor for about 71 e-folds. After the end of
inflation, the field starts to oscillate and can transfer its energy to the
standard model particles through a reheating mechanism. Such a process is
briefly discussed in terms of the admissible couplings of the MDO field with
the electromagnetic and Higgs fields. We show that even if the field loses all
its kinetic energy during reheating, it can evolve as dark matter due a
gravitational coupling (of spinorial origin) with baryonic matter. Since the
field acquires a constant value at the bottom of the potential, a non-null,
although tiny, mass term acts as a dark energy component nowadays. Therefore,
we conclude that MDO fermionic field is a good candidate to drive the whole
evolution of the Universe, in such a way that the inflationary field, dark
matter and dark energy are described by different manifestations of a single
field.

the machines life, low accuracy computations are used when the machine is
healthy. However, on the detection of anomalies, as time progresses, the system
is switched to higher accuracy modes. We show using the NASA bearing dataset

therefore disappears in the decontaminated colour-magnitude diagram. We analyse
the result of tens different decontamination realisations: in none of them we
find evidence of a double BSS sequence. Hence we conclude that NGC 2173

explore the filter pruning and the retraining through qualitative filter

fails to eliminate the filters with repetitive functionality. And the
retraining phase is actually used to reconstruct the remained filters for

precisely addressing the filter functionality redundancy, a CNN can be pruned
without considerable accuracy drop, and the retraining phase is unnecessary.

mammograms that need to be read by a radiologist while keeping the diagnostic
accuracy the same or better than current clinical practice, we develop Man and
Machine Mammography Oracle (MAMMO) - a clinical decision support system capable
of triaging mammograms into those that can be confidently classified by a
machine and those that cannot be, thus requiring the reading of a radiologist.
The first component of MAMMO is a novel multi-view convolutional neural network
(CNN) with multi-task learning (MTL). MTL enables the CNN to learn the
radiological assessments known to be associated with cancer, such as breast
density, conspicuity, suspicion, etc., in addition to learning the primary task
of cancer diagnosis. We show that MTL has two advantages: 1) learning refined
feature representations associated with cancer improves the classification
performance of the diagnosis task and 2) issuing radiological assessments
provides an additional layer of model interpretability that a radiologist can
use to debug and scrutinize the diagnoses provided by the CNN. The second
component of MAMMO is a triage network, which takes as input the radiological
assessment and diagnostic predictions of the first network's MTL outputs and
determines which mammograms can be correctly and confidently diagnosed by the
CNN and which mammograms cannot, thus needing to be read by a radiologist.
Results obtained on a private dataset of 8,162 patients show that MAMMO reduced
the number of radiologist readings by 42.8% while improving the overall
diagnostic accuracy in comparison to readings done by radiologists alone. We
analyze the triage of patients decided by MAMMO to gain a better understanding
of what unique mammogram characteristics require radiologists' expertise.

usually problem-specific. In this study we formulate a reinforcement learning
hyper-heuristic scheme, and propose four low-level heuristics which can work
coherently with the single point search algorithm MOSA/R (Multi-Objective
Simulated Annealing Algorithm based on Re-seed) towards multi-objective
optimization problems of general applications. Making use of the domination
amount, crowding distance and hypervolume calculations, the proposed
hyper-heuristic scheme can meet various optimization requirements adaptively
and autonomously. The approach developed not only exhibits improved and more
robust performance compared to AMOSA, NSGA-II and MOEA/D when applied to
benchmark test cases, but also shows promising results when applied to a
generic structural fault identification problem. The outcome of this research
can be extended to a variety of design and manufacturing optimization
applications.
