overestimate the number of parameters required. In such cases, we may ask
whether the data lies on or near a manifold or a set of manifolds (a so-called
multi-manifold) of lower dimension than the ambient space. This question can be
phrased as a (multi-) manifold hypothesis. The identification of such intrinsic
multiscale features is a cornerstone of data analysis and representation and
has given rise to a large body of work on manifold learning. In this work, we
review key results on multi-scale data analysis and intrinsic dimension
followed by the introduction of a heuristic, multiscale framework for testing
the multi-manifold hypothesis. Our method implements a hypothesis test on a set
of spline-interpolated manifolds constructed from variance-based intrinsic
dimensions. The workflow is suitable for empirical data analysis as we
demonstrate on two use cases.

CrI$_3$ is ferromagnetic, both magneto-optical and transport experiments show
that interlayer exchange for CrI$_3$ bilayers is antiferromagnetic. Bulk
CrI$_3$ is known to assume two crystal structures, rhombohedral and monoclinic,
that differ mostly in the stacking between monolayers. Below 210-220 Kelvin,
bulk CrI$_3$ orders in a rhombohedral phase. Our density functional theory
calculations show a very strong dependence of interlayer exchange and stacking.
Specifically, the ground states of both bulk and free-standing CrI$_3$ bilayers
are ferromagnetic for the rhombohedral phase. In contrast, the energy
difference between both configurations is more than one order of magnitude
smaller for the monoclinic phase, and eventually becomes antiferromagnetic when
either positive strain or on-site Hubbard interactions ($U \geq 3$) are
considered. We also explore the interplay between interlayer hybrydization and
stacking, using a Wannier basis, and between interlayer hybrydization and
relative magnetic alignment for CrI$_3$ bilayers, that helps to account for the
very large tunnel magnetoresistance obvserved in recent experiments.

difference, $\Delta s$, between the excess entropy per particle (relative to an
ideal gas with the same temperature and density), $s_\text{ex}$, and the
pair-correlation contribution, $s_2$. Thus, the RMPE represents the net
contribution to $s_\text{ex}$ due to spatial correlations involving three,
four, or more particles. A heuristic `ordering' criterion identifies the
vanishing of the RMPE as an underlying signature of an impending structural or
thermodynamic transition of the system from a less ordered to a more spatially
organized condition (freezing is a typical example). Regardless of this, the
knowledge of the RMPE is important to assess the impact of non-pair
multiparticle correlations on the entropy of the fluid. Recently, an accurate
and simple proposal for the thermodynamic and structural properties of a
hard-sphere fluid in fractional dimension $1<d<3$ has been proposed [Santos,
A.; L\'opez de Haro, M. \emph{Phys. Rev. E} \textbf{2016}, \emph{93}, 062126].
The aim of this work is to use this approach to evaluate the RMPE as a function
of both $d$ and the packing fraction $\phi$. It is observed that, for any given
dimensionality $d$, the RMPE takes negative values for small densities, reaches
a negative minimum $\Delta s_{\text{min}}$ at a packing fraction
$\phi_{\text{min}}$, and then rapidly increases, becoming positive beyond a
certain packing fraction $\phi_0$. Interestingly, while both
$\phi_{\text{min}}$ and $\phi_0$ monotonically decrease as dimensionality
increases, the value of $\Delta s_{\text{min}}$ exhibits a nonmonotonic
behavior, reaching an absolute minimum at a fractional dimensionality $d\simeq
2.38$. A plot of the scaled RMPE $\Delta s/|\Delta s_{\text{min}}|$ shows a
quasiuniversal behavior in the region $-0.14\lesssim\phi-\phi_0\lesssim 0.02$.

resources often go under-utilized.
  In this work, we propose a mechanism that improves cluster utilization, thus
decreasing the average turnaround time, while preventing application failures
due to contention in accessing finite resources such as RAM. Our approach
monitors resource utilization and employs a data-driven approach to resource
demand forecasting, featuring quantification of uncertainty in the predictions.
Using demand forecast and its confidence, our mechanism modulates cluster
resources assigned to running applications, and reduces the turnaround time by
more than one order of magnitude while keeping application failures under
control. Thus, tenants enjoy a responsive system and providers benefit from an
efficient cluster utilization.

  2019",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Training a model to perform a task typically requires a large amount of data
from the domains in which the task will be applied. However, it is often the
case that data are abundant in some domains but scarce in others. Domain
adaptation deals with the challenge of adapting a model trained from a
data-rich source domain to perform well in a data-poor target domain. In
general, this requires learning plausible mappings between domains. CycleGAN is
a powerful framework that efficiently learns to map inputs from one domain to
another using adversarial training and a cycle-consistency constraint. However,
the conventional approach of enforcing cycle-consistency via reconstruction may
be overly restrictive in cases where one or more domains have limited training
data. In this paper, we propose an augmented cyclic adversarial learning model
that enforces the cycle-consistency constraint via an external task specific
model, which encourages the preservation of task-relevant content as opposed to
exact reconstruction. We explore digit classification in a low-resource setting
in supervised, semi and unsupervised situation, as well as high resource
unsupervised. In low-resource supervised setting, the results show that our
approach improves absolute performance by 14% and 4% when adapting SVHN to
MNIST and vice versa, respectively, which outperforms unsupervised domain
adaptation methods that require high-resource unlabeled target domain.
Moreover, using only few unsupervised target data, our approach can still
outperforms many high-resource unsupervised models. In speech domains, we
similarly adopt a speech recognition model from each domain as the task
specific model. Our approach improves absolute performance of speech
recognition by 2% for female speakers in the TIMIT dataset, where the majority
of training samples are from male voices.

standard forward uncertainty quantification problem where an assumed

to produce a probability density, often called a push-forward probability
density, on a set of quantities of interest (QoI). The inverse problem
considered in this paper seeks a posterior probability density on model input
parameters such that the subsequent push-forward density through the
parameter-to-QoI map matches a given probability density on the QoI. We prove
that the probability densities obtained from solving the forward and inverse
problems, using approximate models, converge to the true probability densities
as the approximate models converges to the true models. Numerical results are
presented to demonstrate optimal convergence of probability densities for
sparse grid approximations of parameter-to-QoI maps and standard spatial and

smart cities. In particular, on-demand ridesharing services, which group
together passengers with similar itineraries, are already operating in several
metropolitan areas. These services can be of significant social and
environmental benefit, by reducing travel costs, road congestion and co2
emissions. The deployment of autonomous cars in the near future will surely
change the way people are traveling. It is even more promising for a
ridesharing service, since it will be easier and cheaper for a company to
handle a fleet of autonomous cars that can serve the demands of different
passengers.
  We argue that user satisfaction should be the main objective when trying to
find the best assignment of passengers to vehicles and the determination of
their routes. Moreover, the model of user satisfaction should be rich enough to
capture the traveling distance, cost, and other factors as well. We show that
it is more important to capture a rich model of human satisfaction than peruse
an optimal performance. That is, we developed a practical algorithm for
assigning passengers to vehicles, which outperforms assignment algorithms that
are optimal, but use a simpler satisfaction model.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to exclusively
concentrate on a rich and realistic function of user satisfaction as the
objective, which is (arguably) the most important aspect to consider for
achieving a widespread adaption of ridesharing services.

exception mining and outlier detection to the case of object-relational data.
Object-relational data represent a complex heterogeneous network [12], which
comprises objects of different types, links among these objects, also of
different types, and attributes of these links. This special structure
prohibits a direct vectorial data representation. We follow the
well-established Exceptional Model Mining framework, which leverages machine
learning models for exception mining: A object is exceptional to the extent
that a model learned for the object data differs from a model learned for the
general population. Exceptional objects can be viewed as outliers. We apply
state of-the-art probabilistic modelling techniques for object-relational data
that construct a graphical model (Bayesian network), which compactly represents
probabilistic associations in the data. A new metric, derived from the learned
object-relational model, quantifies the extent to which the individual
association pattern of a potential outlier deviates from that of the whole
population. The metric is based on the likelihood ratio of two parameter
vectors: One that represents the population associations, and another that
represents the individual associations. Our method is validated on synthetic
datasets and on real-world data sets about soccer matches and movies. Compared
to baseline methods, our novel transformed likelihood ratio achieved the best

given a sample-based, variational characterization, thereby creating an
adversarial setting: as one player seeks to push forward one distribution to

the two distributions fail to match. The procedure solves local problems
matching consecutive, intermediate distributions between $\mu$ and $\nu$. As a
result, maps of arbitrary complexity can be built by composing the simple maps

coronal heating. However, the origin of these waves is still unclear. In this
work, we analyse coordinated observations from \textit{Hinode}/SOT and
\textit{IRIS} of a prominence/coronal rain loop-like structure at the limb of
the Sun. Cool and dense downflows and upflows are observed along the structure.
A collision between a downward and an upward flow with an estimated energy flux
of $10^{7}-10^{8}$~erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$ is observed to generate oscillatory
transverse perturbations of the strands with an estimated
$\approx40~$km~s$^{-1}$ total amplitude, and a short-lived brightening event
with the plasma temperature increasing to at least $10^{5}~$K. We interpret
this response as sausage and kink transverse MHD waves based on 2D MHD
simulations of plasma flow collision. The lengths, density and velocity
differences between the colliding clumps and the strength of the magnetic field
are major parameters defining the response to the collision. The presence of
asymmetry between the clumps (angle of impact surface and/or offset of flowing
axis) is crucial to generate a kink mode. Using the observed values we
successfully reproduce the observed transverse perturbations and brightening,
and show adiabatic heating to coronal temperatures. The numerical modelling
indicates that the plasma $\beta$ in this loop-like structure is confined
between $0.09$ and $0.36$. These results suggest that such collisions from
counter-streaming flows can be a source of in-situ transverse MHD waves, and
that for cool and dense prominence conditions such waves could have significant
amplitudes.

Least-Squares (WLS) estimators can be constructed using $m$ random samples
distributed according to an auxiliary probability measure $\mu$ that depends on

first contribution, we present novel results on the stability and accuracy of
WLS estimators with a given approximation space, using random samples that are
more structured than those used in the previous analysis. As a second
contribution, we study approximation by WLS estimators in the adaptive setting.
For any sequence of nested spaces $(V_k)_{k} \subset L^2(X,\rho)$, we show that
a sequence of WLS estimators of $u$, one for each space $V_k$, can be
sequentially constructed such that: i) the estimators remain provably stable

for all iterations from one to $k$, and ii) the overall number of samples
necessary to construct all the first $k$ estimators remains linearly
proportional to the dimension of $V_k$. We propose two sampling algorithms that
achieve this goal. The first one is a purely random algorithm that recycles
most of the samples from the previous iterations. The second algorithm recycles
all the samples from all the previous iterations. Such an achievement is made
possible by crucially exploiting the structure of the random samples. Finally
we develop numerical methods for the adaptive approximation of functions in
high dimension.

tracing is a challenge. The diffusion approximation reduces the problem to
solving a simple linear partial differential equation. Flux-limited diffusion
introduces non-linearities to improve the accuracy of the solution, especially
in low optical depth media, but introduces several ad-hoc assumptions. Both
methods are based on a spherical harmonics expansion of the radiance field that
is truncated after the first order. In this paper, we investigate the open
question of whether going to higher spherical harmonic orders provides a viable
improvement to these two approaches. Increasing the order introduces a set of
complex coupled partial differential equations (the $P_N$-equations), whose
growing number make them difficult to work with at higher orders. We thus use a
computer algebra framework for representing and manipulating the underlying
mathematical equations, and use it to derive the real-valued $P_N$-equations
for arbitrary orders. We further present a staggered-grid $P_N$-solver and
generate its stencil code directly from the expression tree of the
$P_N$-equations. Finally, we discuss how our method compares to prior work for
various standard problems.

impressive outburst in January 2015 (Phase A), followed by minor activity in
February (Phase B). The MAGIC observations were triggered by the optical flux
observed in Phase A, corresponding to the brightest ever reported state of the
source in the R-band. The comprehensive dataset collected is investigated in
order to shed light on the mechanism of the broadband emission.
Multi-wavelength light curves have been studied together with the broadband
Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs). The data set collected spans from radio,
optical photometry and polarimetry, X-ray, high-energy (HE, 0.1 GeV < E < 100
GeV) with \textit{Fermi}-LAT to the very-high-energy (VHE, E>100 GeV) with
MAGIC. The flaring state of Phase A was detected in all the energy bands,
providing for the first time a multi-wavelength sample of simultaneous data
from the radio band to the VHE. In the constructed SED the
\textit{Swift}-XRT+\textit{NuSTAR} data constrain the transition between the
synchrotron and inverse Compton components very accurately, while the second
peak is constrained from 0.1~GeV to 600~GeV by \textit{Fermi}+MAGIC data. The
broadband SED cannot be described with a one-zone synchrotron self-Compton
model as it severely underestimates the optical flux in order to reproduce the
X-ray to $\gamma$-ray data. Instead we use a two-zone model. The EVPA shows an
unprecedented fast rotation. An estimation of the redshift of the source by
combined HE and VHE data provides a value of $z = 0.31 \pm 0.02_{stats} \pm
0.05_{sys}$, confirming the literature value. The data show the VHE emission
originating in the entrance and exit of a superluminal knot in and out a
recollimation shock in the inner jet. A shock-shock interaction in the jet
seems responsible for the observed flares and EVPA swing. This scenario is also
consistent with the SED modelling.

concentration of surface-active substance into streaks or bands, which are
regularly seen in synthetic aperture radar imagery of the ocean surface. These

from interaction of ship-induced current with ambient surface waves. Once
generated, the circulations persist due to their large-scale nearly-inviscid
nature. Numerical simulations of the wake behind a surface ship in calm, head,
and following seas are presented and show good agreement with radar imagery
from at-sea experiments. It is demonstrated that surface currents do not
persist in the absence of surface waves, but can persist for tens of kilometers
through the formation of Langmuir-type circulations. Since the circulations are
driven by the cross product of the Stokes drift and the wake vorticity, the
structure of the persistent wake is a function of relative heading of the ship

multivariate discriminative models that allow efficient statistical inference
for neuroimage analysis. The framework, termed generative discriminative
machine (GDM), augments discriminative models with a generative regularization
term. We demonstrate that the proposed formulation can be optimized in closed
form and in dual space, allowing efficient computation for high dimensional
neuroimaging datasets. Furthermore, we provide an analytic estimation of the
null distribution of the model parameters, which enables efficient statistical
inference and p-value computation without the need for permutation testing. We
compared the proposed method with both purely generative and discriminative
learning methods in two large structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI)
datasets of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n=415) and Schizophrenia (n=853). Using
the AD dataset, we demonstrated the ability of GDM to robustly handle
confounding variations. Using Schizophrenia dataset, we demonstrated the
ability of GDM to handle multi-site studies. Taken together, the results
underline the potential of the proposed approach for neuroimaging analyses.

soliton state in the one-dimensional Dirac equation with mass domain wall, and
the interplay of ABSs with symmetry and topology enriches their physical
characteristics. We make an overview of Andreev bound states with a special
focus on superfluid $^3$He. The quantum liquid confined to restricted

mass acquisition of Majorana fermions driven by spontaneous symmetry breaking,
topological quantum criticality, Weyl superfluidity, and the anomalous magnetic

transfer function is hard to obtain in advance and varies with time and

agnostic end-to-end system that does not rely on any prior information about
the channel. We use a conditional generative adversarial net (GAN) to represent
the channel effects, where the encoded signal of the transmitter will serve as
the conditioning information. In addition, in order to deal with the
time-varying channel, the received signal corresponding to the pilot data can
also be added as a part of the conditioning information. From the simulation

semimetal and the excitonic insulator in two dimensions. Even though the system
has a semimetallic ground state, there are observable effects of excitonic
pairing at finite temperatures and/or finite energies, provided that the system
is in proximity to the excitonic insulating transition. To determine the
quantum critical behavior, we consider three potentially important
interactions, including the Yukawa coupling between Dirac fermions and the
excitonic order parameter fluctuation, the long-range Coulomb interaction, and
the disorder scattering. We employ the renormalization group technique to study
how these interactions affect quantum criticality and also how they influence
each other. We first investigate the Yukawa coupling in the clean limit, and
show that it gives rise to typical non-Fermi liquid behavior. Adding random
scalar potential to the system always turns such a non-Fermi liquid into a
compressible diffusive metal. In comparison, the non-Fermi liquid behavior is
further enhanced by random vector potential, but is nearly unaffected by random
mass. Incorporating the Coulomb interaction may change the results
qualitatively. In particular, the non-Fermi liquid state is protected by the
Coulomb interaction for weak random scalar potential, and it becomes a
diffusive metal only when random scalar potential becomes sufficiently strong.
When random vector potential or random mass coexists with Yukawa coupling and
Coulomb interaction, the system is a stable non-Fermi liquid state, with
fermion velocities flowing to constants in the former case and being singularly
renormalized in the latter case. These quantum critical phenomena can be probed
by measuring observable quantities.

social phenomena such as adoption of cultural fads, the diffusion of belief,
norms, and innovations in social networks, and the rise of collective action to
join a riot. Most existing works focus on contagions where individuals' states
are represented by {\em binary} variables, and propagation takes place over a
single isolated network. However, characterization of an individual's standing
on a given matter as a binary state might be overly simplistic as most of our
opinions, feelings, and perceptions vary over more than two states. Also, most
real-world contagions take place over multiple networks (e.g., Twitter and
Facebook) or involve {\em multiplex} networks where individuals engage in
different {\em types} of relationships (e.g., acquaintance, co-worker, family,

that take place over multi-layer or multiplex networks. Under a linear
threshold based contagion model, we give analytic results for the probability
and expected size of \textit{global} cascades, i.e., cases where a randomly
chosen node can initiate a propagation that eventually reaches a {\em positive}

advances in generative adversarial network (GAN) architectures to account for
temporal correlations and generate adversarial samples that can cause
misclassification rates of over 80% for targeted activities. More importantly,
the samples also leave other activities largely unaffected making them
extremely stealthy. Finally, we also surprisingly find that in many scenarios,

Up-to-date information serves as the basis for changing street directions as
well as guiding individual vehicles to a fitting parking slot. In this context,
not only abstract indicators like traffic flow and density are required, but
also data about mobility parameters and class information of individual
vehicles. Consequently, accurate and reliable systems that are capable of
providing these kinds of information in real-time are highly demanded. In this
paper, we present a system for classifying vehicles based on their
radio-fingerprints which applies cutting-edge machine learning models and can
be non-intrusively installed into the existing road infrastructure in an ad-hoc
manner. In contrast to other approaches, it is able to provide accurate
classification results without causing privacy-violations or being vulnerable
to challenging weather conditions. Moreover, it is a promising candidate for
large-scale city deployments due to its cost-efficient installation and
maintenance properties. The proposed system is evaluated in a comprehensive
field evaluation campaign within an experimental live deployment on a German
highway, where it is able to achieve a binary classification success ratio of
more than 99% and an overall accuracy of 89.15% for a fine-grained
classification task with nine different classes.

interference among concurrent transmissions in a predictable manner to ensure
the required communication reliability. To this end, we propose a Unified
Cellular Scheduling (UCS) framework that, based on the Physical-Ratio-K (PRK)
interference model, schedules uplink, downlink, and D2D transmissions in a
unified manner to ensure predictable communication reliability while maximizing
channel spatial reuse. UCS also provides a simple, effective approach to mode
selection that maximizes the communication capacity for each involved
communication pair. UCS effectively uses multiple channels for high throughput
as well as resilience to channel fading and external interference. Leveraging
the availability of base stations (BSes) as well as high-speed, out-of-band
connectivity between BSes, UCS effectively orchestrates the functionalities of
BSes and user equipment (UE) for light-weight control signaling and ease of
incremental deployment and integration with existing cellular standards. We
have implemented UCS using the open-source, standards-compliant cellular
networking platform OpenAirInterface. We have validated the OpenAirInterface
implementation using USRP B210 software-defined radios and lab deployment. We
have also evaluated UCS through high-fidelity, at-scale simulation studies; we
observe that UCS ensures predictable communication reliability while achieving
a higher channel spatial reuse rate than existing mechanisms, and that the
distributed UCS framework enables a channel spatial reuse rate statistically
equal to that in the state-of-the-art centralized scheduling algorithm iOrder.

ZD strategy unilaterally enforces a linear relation between average payoffs of
players. Although existence and evolutional stability of ZD strategies have
been studied in simple games, their mathematical properties have not been
well-known yet. For example, what happens when more than one players employ ZD
strategies have not been clarified. In this paper, we provide a general
framework for investigating situations where more than one players employ ZD
strategies in terms of linear algebra. First, we theoretically prove that a set
of linear relations of average payoffs enforced by ZD strategies always has
solutions, which implies that incompatible linear relations are impossible.
Second, we prove that linear payoff relations are independent of each other
under some conditions. These results hold for general games with public
monitoring including perfect-monitoring games. Furthermore, we provide a simple
example of a two-player game in which one player can simultaneously enforce two
linear relations, that is, simultaneously control her and her opponent's
average payoffs. All of these results elucidate general mathematical properties
of ZD strategies.

state-of-the-art bounds given in the literature. Further comparison of these
bounds yields either segments on the capacity region boundary or the full

study the two-user Gaussian state-dependent Z-IC and state-dependent IC. Three
interference regimes are studied, and the capacity region or the sum capacity
boundary is characterized either fully or partially under various channel
parameters. The impact of the correlation between the states on the
cancellation of state and interference as well as the achievability of the
capacity is demonstrated via numerical analysis. Numerical investigation
indicates that for the regular IC, the correlation between states impacts the
achievability of the channel capacity in a different way from that of the Z-IC.

the first time in the quantum setting, and present a quantum algorithm for VT
based on the framework proposed by Henriques et al. [IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal.
Mach. Intell., 7, 583 (2015)]. Our algorithm comprises two phases: training and
detection. In the training phase, in order to discriminate the object and
background, the algorithm trains a ridge regression classifier in the quantum
state form where the optimal fitting parameters of ridge regression are encoded
in the amplitudes. In the detection phase, the classifier is then employed to
generate a quantum state whose amplitudes encode the responses of all the
candidate image patches. The algorithm is shown to be polylogarithmic in
scaling, when the image data matrices have low condition numbers, and therefore
may achieve exponential speedup over the best classical counterpart. However,
only quadratic speedup can be achieved when the algorithm is applied to
implement the ultimate task of Henriques's framework, i.e., detecting the
object position. We also discuss two other important applications related to
VT: (1) object disappearance detection and (2) motion behavior matching, where
much more significant speedup over the classical methods can be achieved. This
work demonstrates the power of quantum computing in solving computer vision

orbital period of 0.8192 days. New light curves in $B, V, (RI)_C$ bands were
obtained with the 0.61-m reflector robotic telescope (PROMPT-8) at CTIO in
Chile from January to February 2015 and from March to April 2017. By analyzing
those photometric data with the W-D method, it is found that TY Pup is a
low-mass-ratio ($q \sim$ 0.184) and deep contact binary with a high fill-out
factor ($84.3\,\%$). An investigation of all available times of minimum light
including three new ones obtained with the 60-cm and the 1.0-m telescopes at
Yunnan Observatories in China indicates that the period change of TY Pup is
complex. An upward parabolic variation in the $O-C$ diagram is detected to be
superimposed on a cyclic oscillation. The upward parabolic change reveals a
long-term continuous increase in the orbital period at a rate of
$\mathrm{d}P/\mathrm{d}t = 5.57(\pm 0.08)\times10^{-8}$ d $\textrm{yr}^{-1}$.
The period increase can be explained by mass transfer from the less massive
component ($M_2 \sim 0.3 M_{\odot}$) to the more massive one ($M_1 \sim 1.65
M_{\odot}$) and the mass ratio of the binary system will become more smaller.
In this way, the binary will be merging when it meets the criterion that the
orbital angular momentum is less than 3 times the total spin angular momentum,
i.e., $J_{orb} < 3J_{rot}$. This suggests that the system will finally merge
into a rapid-rotating single star and may produce a luminous red nova. The
cyclic oscillation in the $O-C$ diagram can be interpreted by the light-travel
time effect (LITE) via the presence of an additional companion.

  Design 2018",,,,"cs.LG cs.AR cs.NE stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep neural networks (DNN) are increasingly being accelerated on
application-specific hardware such as the Google TPU designed especially for
deep learning. Timing speculation is a promising approach to further increase
the energy efficiency of DNN accelerators. Architectural exploration for timing
speculation requires detailed gate-level timing simulations that can be
time-consuming for large DNNs that execute millions of multiply-and-accumulate
(MAC) operations. In this paper we propose FATE, a new methodology for fast and
accurate timing simulations of DNN accelerators like the Google TPU. FATE
proposes two novel ideas: (i) DelayNet, a DNN based timing model for MAC units;
and (ii) a statistical sampling methodology that reduces the number of MAC
operations for which timing simulations are performed. We show that FATE
results in between 8 times-58 times speed-up in timing simulations, while
introducing less than 2% error in classification accuracy estimates. We
demonstrate the use of FATE by comparing to conventional DNN accelerator that
uses 2's complement (2C) arithmetic with an alternative implementation that
uses signed magnitude representations (SMR). We show that that the SMR
implementation provides 18% more energy savings for the same classification
accuracy than 2C, a result that might be of independent interest.

with dark matter and the running vacuum energy which is phenomenologically a
combination of $H^2$ and $\dot{H},$ produces either eternal deceleration or
acceleration in the absence of a bare constant in the density of the running
vacuum. In this paper we have shown that, in the interaction scenario, where
the interaction between matter and vacuum is introduced through a
phenomenological term, the two component model is capable of causing a
transition from a prior decelerated to a later accelerated epoch without a bare
constant in the running vacuum density. On contrasting the model with the
cosmological data, we have found that the interaction coupling constant, is
small enough, for a slow decay of the running vacuum. The model is subjected to
dynamical system analysis which revealed that the end de Sitter phase of the
model is a stable one. We did an analysis on the thermal behavior of the
system, which shows that the entropy is bounded at the end stage so that the
system is behaving like an ordinary macroscopic system. Apart from these we
have also performed the state finder diagnostic analysis which implies the
quintessence nature of running vacuum and confirms that the model will approach
the standard $\Lambda$CDM in the future.

space have received a great deal of attention in the computational geometry
community. In contrast, works involving multiple convex bodies are generally
limited to dimensions $d \leq 3$ and/or do not consider approximation. In this
paper, we consider approximations to two natural problems involving multiple
convex bodies: detecting whether two polytopes intersect and computing their
Minkowski sum. Given an approximation parameter $\varepsilon > 0$, we show how
to independently preprocess two polytopes $A,B$ into data structures of size
$O(1/\varepsilon^{(d-1)/2})$ such that we can answer in polylogarithmic time
whether $A$ and $B$ intersect approximately. More generally, we can answer this
for the images of $A$ and $B$ under affine transformations. Next, we show how
to $\varepsilon$-approximate the Minkowski sum of two given polytopes defined
as the intersection of $n$ halfspaces in $O(n \log(1/\varepsilon) +
1/\varepsilon^{(d-1)/2 + \alpha})$ time, for any constant $\alpha > 0$.
Finally, we present a surprising impact of these results to a well studied
problem that considers a single convex body. We show how to
$\varepsilon$-approximate the width of a set of $n$ points in $O(n
\log(1/\varepsilon) + 1/\varepsilon^{(d-1)/2 + \alpha})$ time, for any constant
$\alpha > 0$, a major improvement over the previous bound of roughly $O(n +

of flocking that has been studied in many works, e.g. [1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 20, 21,
22]. In particular, in the case of singular interactions between agents, as is
the case of the CS model with communication weights of the type
$\psi(s)=s^{-\alpha}$ for $\alpha \geq 1$, it is important for showing global
well-posedness of the underlying particle dynamics. In [4], a proof of the
non-collision property for singular interactions is given in the case of the
linear CS model, i.e. when the velocity coupling between agents $i,j$ is
$v_{j}-v_{i}$. This paper can be seen as an extension of the analysis in [4].
We show that particles avoid collisions even when the linear coupling in the CS
system has been substituted with the nonlinear term $\Gamma(\cdot)$ introduced
in [12] (typical examples being $\Gamma(v)=v|v|^{2(\gamma -1)}$ for $\gamma \in
(\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{2})$), and prove that no collisions can happen in finite
time when $\alpha \geq 1$. We also show uniform estimates for the minimum
inter-particle distance, for a communication weight with expanded singularity
$\psi_{\delta}(s)=(s-\delta)^{-\alpha}$, when $\alpha \geq 2\gamma$, $\delta
\geq 0$.

radiotherapy. Existing radiotherapy plans for brain tumors derive from
population studies and scarcely account for patient-specific conditions. Here
we provide a Bayesian machine learning framework for the rational design of
improved, personalized radiotherapy plans using mathematical modeling and
patient multimodal medical scans. Our method, for the first time, integrates
complementary information from high resolution MRI scans and highly specific
FET-PET metabolic maps to infer tumor cell density in glioblastoma patients.
The Bayesian framework quantifies imaging and modeling uncertainties and
predicts patient-specific tumor cell density with confidence intervals. The
proposed methodology relies only on data acquired at a single time point and
thus is applicable to standard clinical settings. An initial clinical
population study shows that the radiotherapy plans generated from the inferred
tumor cell infiltration maps spare more healthy tissue thereby reducing
radiation toxicity while yielding comparable accuracy with standard
radiotherapy protocols. Moreover, the inferred regions of high tumor cell
densities coincide with the tumor radioresistant areas, providing guidance for
personalized dose-escalation. The proposed integration of multimodal scans and
mathematical modeling provides a robust, non-invasive tool to assist

the research community. One reason for the slow uptake of these systems in the
clinical setting is that they are complex, opaque and tend to fail silently.
Outside of the medical imaging domain, the machine learning community has
recently proposed several techniques for quantifying model uncertainty (i.e.~a
model knowing when it has failed). This is important in practical settings, as
we can refer such cases to manual inspection or correction by humans. In this
paper, we aim to bring these recent results on estimating uncertainty to bear
on two important outputs in deep learning-based segmentation. The first is
producing spatial uncertainty maps, from which a clinician can observe where
and why a system thinks it is failing. The second is quantifying an image-level
prediction of failure, which is useful for isolating specific cases and
removing them from automated pipelines. We also show that reasoning about
spatial uncertainty, the first output, is a useful intermediate representation
for generating segmentation quality predictions, the second output. We propose
a two-stage architecture for producing these measures of uncertainty, which can
accommodate any deep learning-based medical segmentation pipeline.

social network in our daily life. Automatically interpreting such relationships
bears a great potential for the intelligent systems to understand human
behavior in depth and to better interact with people at a social level. Human
beings interpret the social relationships within a group not only based on the
people alone, and the interplay between such social relationships and the
contextual information around the people also plays a significant role.
However, these additional cues are largely overlooked by the previous studies.
We found that the interplay between these two factors can be effectively
modeled by a novel structured knowledge graph with proper message propagation
and attention. And this structured knowledge can be efficiently integrated into
the deep neural network architecture to promote social relationship
understanding by an end-to-end trainable Graph Reasoning Model (GRM), in which
a propagation mechanism is learned to propagate node message through the graph

knowledge accumulated from daily lives or professions. For example, to achieve
fine-grained image recognition (e.g., categorizing hundreds of subordinate

organization including category labels and part-level attributes. In this work,
we investigate how to unify rich professional knowledge with deep neural
network architectures and propose a Knowledge-Embedded Representation Learning
(KERL) framework for handling the problem of fine-grained image recognition.
Specifically, we organize the rich visual concepts in the form of knowledge
graph and employ a Gated Graph Neural Network to propagate node message through
the graph for generating the knowledge representation. By introducing a novel
gated mechanism, our KERL framework incorporates this knowledge representation
into the discriminative image feature learning, i.e., implicitly associating
the specific attributes with the feature maps. Compared with existing methods
of fine-grained image classification, our KERL framework has several appealing
properties: i) The embedded high-level knowledge enhances the feature
representation, thus facilitating distinguishing the subtle differences among
subordinate categories. ii) Our framework can learn feature maps with a
meaningful configuration that the highlighted regions finely accord with the
nodes (specific attributes) of the knowledge graph. Extensive experiments on
the widely used Caltech-UCSD bird dataset demonstrate the superiority of our
KERL framework over existing state-of-the-art methods.

population encoding. The underlying biophysical mechanisms, however, are not
well understood. Reducing the sharpness of the action potential onset can
impair ultrafast population encoding, but it is not clear whether a sharp
action potential onset is sufficient for ultrafast population encoding. One
hypothesis proposes that the sharp action potential onset is caused by the
electrotonic separation of the site of action potential initiation from the
soma, and that this spatial separation also results in ultrafast population
encoding. Here we examined this hypothesis by studying the linear response
properties of model neurons with a defined initiation site. We find that
placing the initiation site at different axonal positions has only a weak
impact on the linear response function of the model. It fails to generate the
ultrafast response and high bandwidth that is observed in cortical neurons.
Furthermore, the high frequency regime of the linear response function of this
model is insensitive to correlation times of the input current contradicting
empirical evidence. When we increase the voltage sensitivity of sodium channels
at the initiation site, the two empirically observed phenomena can be
recovered. We provide an explanation for the dissociation of sharp action
potential onset and ultrafast response. By investigating varying soma sizes, we
furthermore highlight the effect of neuron morphology on the linear response.
Our results show that a sharp onset of action potentials is not sufficient for
the ultrafast response. In the light of recent reports of activity-dependent
repositioning of the axon initial segment, our study predicts that a more
distal initiation site can lead to an increased sharpness of the somatic
waveform but it does not affect the linear response of a population of neurons.

function for pairs of neutrinos may contain information about the size of the
proto-neutron star formed in a Galactic core-collapse supernova. The
information about the size of the source emerges via the neutrino equivalent of
intensity interferometry originally used by Hanbury-Brown and Twiss with
photons to measure the radii of stars. However the analytic demonstration of
neutrino intensity interferometry with supernova neutrinos made a number of
approximations: that the two neutrinos had equal energies, the neutrinos were
emitted at simultaneous times from two points and were detected simultaneously
at two detection points that formed a plane with the emission points. These
approximations need to be relaxed in order to better determine the feasibility
of neutrino intensity interferometry for supernovae neutrinos in a more
realistic scenario. In this paper we further investigate the feasibility of
intensity interferometry for supernova neutrinos by relaxing all the
approximations made in the earlier study. We find that, while relaxing any one
assumption reduces the correlation signal, the relaxation of the assumption of
equal times of detection is by far the largest detrimental factor. For neutrino
energies of order $\sim$15 MeV and a supernova distance of L = 10 kpc, we show
that in order to observe the interference pattern in the two-point correlation
function of the neutrino pairs, the timing resolution of a detector needs to be
on the order of $\lesssim 10^{-21}\;{\rm s}$ if the initial neutrino wave

time, having to do with temporal order rather than spatial separation.
Nonetheless, the physical assumptions regarding causality are seldom studied in
this context, and often even go unmentioned, in stark contrast with the many
different possible locality conditions which have been studied and elaborated.
In the present work, some retrocausal toy-models which reproduce the
predictions of Quantum Mechanics for Bell-type correlations are reviewed. It is
pointed out that a certain toy-model which is ostensibly superdeterministic --
based on denying the free-variable status of some of Quantum Mechanics' input
parameters -- actually contains within it a complete retrocausal toy-model.
Occam's razor thus indicates that the superdeterministic point of view is
superfluous. A challenge is to generalize the retrocausal toy-models to a full
theory -- a reformulation of Quantum Mechanics -- in which the standard causal
arrow of time would be replaced by a more lenient one: an arrow of time
applicable only to macroscopically-available information. In discussing such a
reformulation, one finds that many of the perplexing features of Quantum
Mechanics could arise naturally, especially in the context of stochastic
theories.

Moreover, existing methods usually assume that the dataset is balanced, which

from the root-face contour, no other closed walk of length d encloses the
root-face) and a family of decorated unicellular maps. The orientations and
bijections can then be generalized, for any d>=1, to toroidal face-rooted maps
of essential girth d with a root-face of degree d (and with the same root-face
contour condition as for d-angulations), and they take a simpler form in the
bipartite case, as a parity specialization. On the enumerative side we obtain
explicit algebraic expressions for the generating functions of rooted
essentially simple triangulations and bipartite quadrangulations on the torus.
Our bijective constructions can be considered as toroidal counterparts of those
obtained by Bernardi and the first author in the planar case, and they also
build on ideas introduced by Despr\'e, Gon\c{c}alves and the second author for
essentially simple triangulations, of imposing a balancedness condition on the
orientations in genus 1.

emitters of K-$\alpha$ line of neutral iron and X-ray continuum in the Galactic
center (GC). Similarly to the cloud Sgr B2, another well-known emitter of the
iron line in the GC, the Arches cloud demonstrates temporal decline of the
X-ray emission. The most natural origin of this emission is irradiation of
primary photons of an X-ray flare from a distant source, most likely Sgr A*.
However, recent observations of the Arches cloud discovered variations of
equivalent width of the 6.4 keV iron line, which indicated that the X-ray
emission from the cloud is a combination of two components with different
origin and different equivalent width, one of which is time-variable, while the
other is stationary during the period of observations. We considered two
different scenarios: a) this emission is formed by reflection from two clouds,
which are at some distance from each other, when they are irradiated by two
different flares; and b) the other scenario assumes a combination of X-ray
fluxes produced in the same cloud by reflection of primary photons and by
subrelativistic cosmic rays. We present restrictions for both model and
conditions at which these scenarios can be realized. Although none of the
models can be completely ruled out, we find that the X-ray reflection model
requires less assumption and therefore is the most viable.

of a community of interacting species. By natural selection through the abiotic
environment and by co-adaptation within the community, species evolve, thereby
giving rise to the ecological networks we regard as ecosystems. This
reductionist perspective can be contrasted with the view that as species have
to fit in the surrounding system, the system itself exerts selection pressure
on the evolutionary pathways of the species. This interplay of bottom-up and
top-down control in the development and growth of ecological systems has long
been discussed, however empirical ecosystem data is scarce and a comprehensive
mathematical framework is lacking. We present a way of quantifying the relative
weight of natural selection and coadaptation grounded in information theory, to
assess the relative role of bottom-up and top-down control in the evolution of
ecological systems, and analyse the information transfer in an individual based
stochastic complex systems model, the Tangled Nature Model of evolutionary
ecology. We show that ecological communities evolve from mainly bottom-up
controlled early-successional systems to more strongly top-down controlled
late-successional systems, as coadaptation progresses. Species which have a
high influence on selection are also generally more abundant. Hence our
findings imply that ecological communities are shaped by a dialogue of
bottom-up and top-down control, where the role of the systemic selection and
integrity becomes more pronounced the further the ecosystem is developed.

by newly taking into account the possible presence of the phase of cylindrical
nuclei. In this study, we neglect an effect of magnetic fields, under which the
shear oscillations can be damped by the magnetic interaction. First, by
identifying the low frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in
the soft-gamma repeaters (SGRs) as the fundamental torsional oscillations, we
constrain the slope parameter of the nuclear symmetry energy, $L$, for
reasonable values of the star's mass $M$ and radius $R$. Meanwhile, we find
that the 1st overtone of torsional oscillations obtained for given $M$ and $R$
can be expressed well as a function of a new parameter $\varsigma\equiv (K_0^4
L^5)^{1/9}$, where $K_0$ is the incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter.
Assuming that the lowest of the QPO frequencies above 500 Hz observed in SGR
1806-20 comes from the 1st overtone, we can constrain the value of $\varsigma$.
Then, for each neutron star model, such a value of $L$ as can be obtained from
the observed low frequency QPOs translates to the optimal value of $K_0$ via
the above constraint on $\varsigma$. Finally, its consistency with allowed
values of $K_0$ from empirical giant monopole resonances leads to neutron star
models with relatively low mass and large radius, which are qualitatively
similar to the prediction in earlier investigations. This result suggests that
$L\simeq 58-73$ MeV, even when uncertainties in the neutron superfluid density
inside the phase of cylindrical nuclei are allowed for.

assume that a common distribution gives rise to the regime-specific regression

treated as fully stochastic and suitable shrinkage priors are used. These
shrinkage priors enable to assess which coefficients differ across regimes in a
flexible manner. In the case of similar coefficients, our model pushes the
respective regions of the parameter space towards the common distribution. This
allows for selecting a parsimonious model while still maintaining sufficient
flexibility to control for sudden shifts in the parameters, if necessary. We
apply our modeling approach to real-time Euro area data and assume transition
probabilities between expansionary and recessionary regimes to be driven by the
cointegration errors. The results suggest that the regime allocation is
governed by a subset of short-run adjustment coefficients and regime-specific
variance-covariance matrices. These findings are complemented by an
out-of-sample forecast exercise, illustrating the advantages of the model for

different kinds of photospheric boundary flows accumulate relative magnetic

identify the onset of an eruption. We use a series of three-dimensional,
parametric magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the formation and eruption of

the same parameters, but they are characterized by different driving
photospheric flows, i.e., shearing, convergence, stretching, peripheral- and
central- dispersion flows. For each of the simulations, the instant of the
onset of the eruption is carefully identified by using a series of relaxation
runs. We find that magnetic energy and total relative helicity are mostly
injected when shearing flows are applied at the boundary, while the magnetic
energy and helicity associated with the coronal electric currents increase
regardless of the kind of photospheric flows. We also find that, at the onset
of the eruptions, the ratio between the non-potential magnetic helicity and the
total relative magnetic helicity has the same value for all the simulations,
suggesting the existence of a threshold in this quantity. Such threshold is not
observed for other quantities as, for example, those related to the magnetic

Hunter and construct approximate solutions at any arbitrarily large order of
accuracy to the free boundary problem in three space dimensions when the
initial discontinuity displays high frequency oscillations. As evidenced in
earlier works, high frequency oscillations of the current vortex sheet give
rise to `surface waves' on either side of the sheet. Such waves decay
exponentially in the normal direction to the current vortex sheet and, in the
weakly nonlinear regime that we consider here, their leading amplitude is
governed by a nonlocal Hamilton-Jacobitype equation known as the `HIZ equation'
(standing for Hamilton-Il'insky-Zabolotskaya) in the context of Rayleigh waves
in elastodynamics. The main achievement of our work is to develop a systematic
approach for constructing arbitrarily many correctors to the leading amplitude.
Based on a suitable duality formula, we exhibit necessary and sufficient
solvability conditions for the corrector equations that need to be solved
iteratively. Theverification of these solvability conditions is based on a
combination of mere algebra and arguments of combinatorial analysis. The
construction of arbitrarily many correctors enables us to produce infinitely
accurate approximate solutions to the free boundary problem. Eventually, we
show that the rectification phenomenon exhibited by Marcou in the context of
Rayleigh waves does not arise in the same way for the current vortex sheet

spatio-temporal data is of fundamental importance for human mobility analysis.
Classical clustering methods have been used in prior work for detecting POIs,
but without considering temporal constraints. Usually, the involved parameters
for clustering are difficult to determine, e.g., the optimal cluster number in
hierarchical clustering. Currently, researchers either choose heuristic values
or use spatial distance-based optimization to determine an appropriate
parameter set. We argue that existing research does not optimally address
temporal information and thus leaves much room for improvement. Considering
temporal constraints in human mobility, we introduce an effective clustering
approach - namely POI clustering with temporal constraints (PC-TC) - to extract
POIs from spatio-temporal data of human mobility. Following human mobility
nature in modern society, our approach aims to extract both global POIs (e.g.,
workplace or university) and local POIs (e.g., library, lab, and canteen).
Based on two publicly available datasets including 193 individuals, our
evaluation results show that PC-TC has much potential for next place prediction
in terms of granularity (i.e., the number of extracted POIs) and
predictability.

nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy MCG-03-58-007. This wind is discovered in a deep Suzaku
observation that was performed in 2010. Overall the X-ray spectrum of
MCG-03-58-007 is highly absorbed by a neutral column density of NH~10^23 cm^-2,
in agreement with the optical classification as a type 2 AGN. In addition, this
observation unveiled the presence of two deep absorption troughs at E = 7.4 +-
0.1 keV and E = 8.5 +- 0.2 keV. If associated with blue-shifted FeXXVI, these
features can be explained with the presence of two highly ionised (log \xi/(erg
cm/s)~ 5.5) and high column density (NH~5-8 x 10^23cm^-2) outflowing absorbers
with v_out1~ -0.1c and v_out2~ -0.2c. The disk wind detected during this
observation is most likely launched from within a few hundreds gravitational
radii from the central black and has a kinetic output that matches the
prescription for significant feedback. The presence of the lower velocity
component of the disk wind is independently confirmed by the analysis of a
follow-up XMM-Newton & NuSTAR observation. A faster (v_out~ -0.35 c) component
of the wind is also seen in this second observation. During this observation we
also witnessed an occultation event lasting \Delta t ~ 120 ksec, which we
ascribe to an increase of the opacity of the disk wind (\Delta NH~1.4x10^24
cm^-2). Our interpretation is that the slow zone (v_out~ -0.1c) of the wind is
the most stable but inhomogeneous component, while the faster zones could be
associated with two different inner streamlines of the wind.

are able to constrain the eccentricities of 51 systems with a single transiting
planet, which supplement our previous measurements of 66 planets in
multi-planet systems. Through a Bayesian hierarchical analysis, we find
evidence that systems with only one detected transiting planet have a different
eccentricity distribution than systems with multiple detected transiting
planets. The eccentricity distribution of the single-transiting systems is well
described by the positive half of a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with a
dispersion $\sigma_e = 0.32 \pm 0.06$, while the multiple-transit systems are
consistent with $\sigma_e = 0.083^{+0.015}_{-0.020}$. A mixture model suggests
a fraction of $0.76^{+0.21}_{-0.12}$ of single-transiting systems have a
moderate eccentricity, represented by a Rayleigh distribution that peaks at
$0.26^{+0.04}_{-0.06}$. This finding may reflect differences in the formation
pathways of systems with different numbers of transiting planets. We
investigate the possibility that eccentricities are ""self-excited"" in closely
packed planetary systems, as well as the influence of long-period giant
companion planets. We find that both mechanisms can qualitatively explain the
observations. We do not find any evidence for a correlation between
eccentricity and stellar metallicity, as has been seen for giant planets.
Neither do we find any evidence that orbital eccentricity is linked to the
detection of a companion star. Along with this paper we make available all of
the parameters and uncertainties in the eccentricity distributions, as well as
the properties of individual systems, for use in future studies.

PMF considering the ongoing and forthcoming direct detection observations of
GWB. In contrast to the conventional cosmological probes, e.g., cosmic
microwave background anisotropies, which are useful to investigate large-scale
PMFs ($>1 {\rm Mpc}$), the direct detection experiments of GWB can explore
small-scale PMFs whose scales correspond to the observed frequencies of GWB. We
show that future ground-based or space-based interferometric gravitational wave
detectors give a strong constraint of about $10^{2} {\rm nG}$ on much smaller
scales of about $k\approx 10^{12} {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. We also demonstrate that
pulsar timing arrays have a potential to strongly constrain PMFs. The current
limits on GWB from pulsar timing arrays can put the tight constraint on the
amplitude of the PMFs of about $30 {\rm nG}$ whose coherent length is of about
$k\approx 10^{6} {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. The future experiments for the direct
detection of GWB by the Square Kilometre Array could give much tighter
constraints on the amplitude of PMFs about $5 {\rm nG}$ on $k\approx 10^{6}

$\omega_1$ for every colouring of the finite sets of countable ordinals that is
definable by a $\Sigma_1$-formula that only uses the cardinal $\omega_1$ and
real numbers as parameters. Moreover, it is shown that certain large cardinal
properties cause analogous partition properties to hold at the given large
cardinal and these implications yield natural examples of inaccessible
cardinals that possess strong partition properties for $\Sigma_1$-definable
colourings and are not weakly compact. In contrast, we show that
$\Sigma_1$-definability behaves fundamentally different at $\omega_2$ by
showing that various large cardinal assumptions and \emph{Martin's Maximum} are
compatible with the existence of a colouring of pairs of elements of $\omega_2$
that is definable by a $\Sigma_1$-formula with parameter $\omega_2$ and has no
uncountable homogeneous set. Our results will also allow us to derive tight
bounds for the consistency strengths of various partition properties for

we address the issue of how to gauge and compare the quality of spatial network
designs (i.e. efficiency vs. total cost) by proposing a two-step methodology.
Firstly, we assess the network's design by introducing a quality function based

to rely on coarse and inaccurate simulations typically performed on rather
small interactive computing facilities and not on much more powerful
high-performance computing architectures operated in batch-mode. This paper
presents a steering environment that intends to bring these two worlds - the
interactive and the classical HPC world - together in an integrated way. The
environment consists of efficient fluid dynamics simulation codes and a
steering and visualisation framework providing a user interface, communication
methods for distributed steering, and parallel visualisation tools. The gap
between steering and HPC is bridged by a hierarchical approach that performs
fast interactive simulations for many scenario variants increasing the accuracy
via hierarchical refinements in dependence of the time the user wants to wait.
Finally, the user can trigger large simulations for selected setups on an HPC
architecture exploiting the pre-computations already done on the interactive

unobservable Gaussian drift process. While the observation of returns yields
information about the underlying drift, we also incorporate discrete-time
expert opinions as an external source of information.
  For estimating the hidden drift it is crucial to consider the conditional
distribution of the drift given the available observations, the so-called
filter. For an investor observing both the return process and the discrete-time
expert opinions, we investigate in detail the asymptotic behavior of the filter
as the frequency of the arrival of expert opinions tends to infinity. In our
setting, a higher frequency of expert opinions comes at the cost of accuracy,
meaning that as the frequency of expert opinions increases, the variance of
expert opinions becomes larger. We consider a model where information dates are
deterministic and equidistant and another model where the information dates
arrive randomly as the jump times of a Poisson process. In both cases we derive
limit theorems stating that the information obtained from observing the
discrete-time expert opinions is asymptotically the same as that from observing
a certain diffusion process which can be interpreted as a continuous-time
expert.
  We use our limit theorems to derive so-called diffusion approximations of the
filter for high-frequency discrete-time expert opinions. These diffusion
approximations are extremely helpful for deriving simplified approximate
solutions of utility maximization problems.

the eigenstates of two quantum chaotic systems coupled with a weak interaction.
The progression from a lack of entanglement in the noninteracting limit to the
entanglement expected of fully randomized states in the opposite limit is
governed by the single scaling transition parameter, $\Lambda$. The behaviors
apply equally well to few- and many-body systems, e.g.\ interacting particles
in quantum dots, spin chains, coupled quantum maps, and Floquet systems as long
as their subsystems are quantum chaotic, and not localized in some manner. To
calculate the generalized moments of the Schmidt eigenvalues in the
perturbative regime, a regularized theory is applied, whose leading order
behaviors depend on $\sqrt{\Lambda}$. The marginal case of the $1/2$ moment,
which is related to the distance to closest maximally entangled state, is an
exception having a $\sqrt{\Lambda}\ln \Lambda$ leading order and a logarithmic
dependence on subsystem size. A recursive embedding of the regularized
perturbation theory gives a simple exponential behavior for the von Neumann
entropy and the Havrda-Charv{\' a}t-Tsallis entropies for increasing
interaction strength, demonstrating a universal transition to nearly maximal
entanglement. Moreover, the full probability densities of the Schmidt
eigenvalues, i.e.\ the entanglement spectrum, show a transition from power laws
and L\'evy distribution in the weakly interacting regime to random matrix
results for the strongly interacting regime. The predicted behaviors are tested
on a pair of weakly interacting kicked rotors, which follow the universal
behaviors extremely well.

In order to unveil their properties in detail, we need spectra with a higher
S/N and also more sophisticated analysis methods. With high-resolution
spectrographs, we can not only detect the sodium feature in the atmosphere of
exoplanets, but also characterize it by studying its line profile. After
finding a clearly w-shaped sodium line profile in the transmission spectrum of
HD189733b, we investigated possible sources of contamination given by the star
and tried to correct for these spurious deformations. By analyzing the single
transmission spectra of HD189733b in the wavelength space, we show that the
main sodium signal that causes the absorption in the transmission spectrum is
centered on the stellar rest frame. We concentrate on two main stellar effects
that contaminate the transmission spectrum: center-to-limb variations and
stellar rotation. We show the effects on the line profile: while we correct for
the CLV using simulated theoretical stellar spectra, we provide a new method,
based directly on observational data, to correct for the RM contribution to the
line profile of the retrieved transmission spectrum. We apply the corrections
to the spectra of HD189733b. Our analysis shows line profiles of the Na D lines
in the transmission spectrum that are narrower than reported previously. The
correction of the D2 line, which is deeper than the D1, is probably still
incomplete since the planetary radius is larger at this wavelength. A careful
detrending from spurious stellar effects followed by an inspection in the
velocity space is mandatory when studying the line profile of atmospheric
features in the high-resolution transmission spectrum of exoplanets. Data with

around for several decades. Deep learning has however made much recent progress
such that it consistently outperforms neuromorphic learning algorithms in
classification tasks in terms of accuracy. Specifically in the field of image
classification, neuromorphic computing has been traditionally using either the
temporal or rate code for encoding static images in datasets into spike trains.
It is only till recently, that neuromorphic vision sensors are widely used by
the neuromorphic research community, and provides an alternative to such
encoding methods. Since then, several neuromorphic datasets as obtained by
applying such sensors on image datasets (e.g. the neuromorphic CALTECH 101)
have been introduced. These data are encoded in spike trains and hence seem
ideal for benchmarking of neuromorphic learning algorithms. Specifically, we
train a deep learning framework used for image classification on the CALTECH
101 and a collapsed version of the neuromorphic CALTECH 101 datasets. We
obtained an accuracy of 91.66% and 78.01% for the CALTECH 101 and neuromorphic
CALTECH 101 datasets respectively. For CALTECH 101, our accuracy is close to
the best reported accuracy, while for neuromorphic CALTECH 101, it outperforms
the last best reported accuracy by over 10%. This raises the question of the
suitability of such datasets as benchmarks for neuromorphic learning
algorithms.

application of lifting rules for marginal-MAP (MMAP), an important inference

two fold: (1) we define a new equivalence class of (logical) variables, called

of SOM-R variables to a single constant.We refer to our lifting technique as
the {\em SOM-R} rule for lifted MMAP. Combined with existing rules such as
decomposer and binomial, this results in a powerful framework for lifted MMAP.
Experiments on three benchmark domains show significant gains in both time and
memory compared to ground inference as well as lifted approaches not using

whether there is a retraction from an input graph $G$ to $H$ is completely
classified, in the sense that it is known for which $H$ this problem is
tractable (assuming $\mathrm{P}\neq \mathrm{NP}$). Similarly, the complexity of
(exactly) counting retractions from $G$ to $H$ is classified (assuming
$\mathrm{FP}\neq \#\mathrm{P}$). However, almost nothing is known about
approximately counting retractions. Our first contribution is to give a
complete trichotomy for approximately counting retractions to graphs of girth

problem for each $H$ in the complexity landscape of related approximate
counting problems. Interestingly, our results are in contrast to the situation

counting retractions is separated both from the problem of approximately
counting homomorphisms and from the problem of approximately counting list
homomorphisms --- whereas for exact counting all three of these problems are
interreducible. We also show that the number of retractions is at least as hard

compactions. In contrast, exactly counting compactions is the hardest of all of
these exact counting problems.

Our DRMs differ from those proposed by Lodhi, which use an Inductive Logic
Programming (ILP) engine to first select features (we use random selections
from a space of features that satisfies some approximate constraints on logical
relevance and non-redundancy). But why do the DRMs predict what they do? One
way of answering this is the LIME setting, in which readable proxies for a
black-box predictor. The proxies are intended only to model the predictions of
the black-box in local regions of the instance-space. But readability alone may
not enough: to be understandable, the local models must use relevant concepts
in an meaningful manner. We investigate the use of a Bayes-like approach to
identify logical proxies for local predictions of a DRM. We show: (a) DRM's
with our randomised propositionalization method achieve state-of-the-art
predictive performance; (b) Models in first-order logic can approximate the

diagnosis of lung cancer, which is critical for best patient care. Although a
number of computer-aided nodule detection methods have been published in the
literature, these methods still have two major drawbacks: missing out true
nodules during the detection of nodule candidates and less-accurate
identification of nodules from non-nodule. In this paper, we propose an
automated pulmonary nodule detection algorithm that jointly combines
progressive resolution and hierarchical saliency. Specifically, we design a 3D
progressive resolution-based densely dilated FCN, namely the progressive
resolution network (PRN), to detect nodule candidates inside the lung, and
construct a densely dilated 3D CNN with hierarchical saliency, namely the
hierarchical saliency network (HSN), to simultaneously identify genuine nodules
from those candidates and estimate the diameters of nodules. We evaluated our
algorithm on the benchmark LUng Nodule Analysis 2016 (LUNA16) dataset and
achieved a state-of-the-art detection score. Our results suggest that the
proposed algorithm can effectively detect pulmonary nodules on chest CT and
accurately estimate their diameters.

Mg3Sb2 exhibits a nearly isotropic three-dimensional (3D) bonding network with

Deep Recurrent Spatial-Aware Network, which adaptively addresses the two issues

Specifically, our framework incorporates a Recurrent Spatial-Aware Refinement
(RSAR) module iteratively conducting two components: i) a Spatial Transformer
Network that dynamically locates an attentional region from the crowd density
map and transforms it to the suitable scale and rotation for optimal crowd

databases by specifying probabilities for several possible instances.
Traditionally, they are finite probability spaces over database instances. Such
finite PDBs inherently make a closed-world assumption: non-occurring facts are
assumed to be impossible, rather than just unlikely. As convincingly argued by
Ceylan et al. (KR '16), this results in implausibilities and clashes with
intuition. An open-world assumption, where facts not explicitly listed may have
a small positive probability can yield more reasonable results. The
corresponding open-world model of Ceylan et al., however, assumes that all
entities in the PDB come from a fixed finite universe.
  In this work, we take one further step and propose a model of ""truly""
open-world PDBs with an infinite universe. This is natural when we consider
entities from typical domains such as integers, real numbers, or strings. While
the probability space might become infinitely large, all instances of a PDB
remain finite. We provide a sound mathematical framework for infinite PDBs
generalizing the existing theory of finite PDBs. Our main results are concerned
with countable, tuple-independent PDBs; we present a generic construction
showing that such PDBs exist in the infinite and provide a characterization of
their existence. This construction can be used to give an open-world semantics
to finite PDBs. The construction can also be extended to so-called
block-independent-disjoint probabilistic databases.
  Algorithmic questions are not the focus of this paper, but we show how query
evaluation algorithms can be lifted from finite PDBs to perform approximate
evaluation (with an arbitrarily small additive approximation error) in
countably infinite tuple-independent PDBs.

analytic sets. In particular, we construct a (not entirely obvious) local
version of the ring of tropical fans with a nondegenerate intersection pairing.
  As an application, we study nearby monodromy eigenvalues -- the eigenvalues
of the monodromy operators of singularities, adjacent to a given singularity of
a holomorphic function $f$. More precisely, we express some of such values in
terms of certain resolutions of $f$. The expression is given it terms of the
exceptional divisor strata of arbitrary codimension, generalizing the classical
A'Campo formula that consumes only codimension 1 strata and produces only
monodromy eigenvalues at the origin. For this purpose, we introduce tropical
characteristic classes of germs of analytic sets, and use this calculus to
detect some of the nearby monodromy eigenvalues, which we call tropical.
  The study is motivated by the monodromy conjectures by Igusa, Denef and
Loeser: every pole of an appropriate local zeta function of $f$ induces a
nearby monodromy eigenvalue. We propose a presumably stronger version of this
conjecture: all poles of the local zeta function induce tropical nearby
monodromy eigenvalues.
  In particular, if the singularity is non-degenerate with respect to its
Newton polyhedron $N$, then the tropical monodromy eigenvalues can be expressed
in terms of fiber polytopes of certain faces of $N$, so our conjecture (unlike
the original ones) becomes a purely combinatorial statement about a polyhedron.
This statement is confirmed for the topological zeta function in dimension up
to 4 in a joint work with A. Lemahieu and K. Takeuchi, which, in particular,
supports our conjecture and proves the original one for non-degenerate
singularities in 4 variables.

in the Bayesian inference to speed up the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
calculations. However, the use of a PC surrogate introduces the modeling error,
that may severely distort the estimate of the posterior distribution. This
error can be corrected by increasing the order of the PC expansion, but the
cost for building the surrogate may increase dramatically. In this work, we
seek to address this challenge by proposing an adaptive procedure to construct
a multi-fidelity PC surrogate. This new strategy combines (a large number of)
low-fidelity surrogate model evaluations and (a small number of) high-fidelity
model evaluations, yielding an adaptive multi-fidelity approach. Here the
low-fidelity surrogate is chosen as the prior-based PC surrogate, while the
high-fidelity model refers to the true forward model. The key idea is to
construct and refine the multi-fidelity approach over a sequence of samples
adaptively determined form data, so that the approximation can eventually
concentrate to the posterior distribution. We illustrate the performance of the
proposed strategy through two nonlinear inverse problems. It is shown that the
proposed adaptive multi-fidelity approach can improve significantly the
accuracy, yet without a dramatic increase in the computational complexity. The
numerical results also indicate that our new algorithm can enhance the
efficiency by several orders of magnitude compared to a standard MCMC approach
using only the true forward model.

matrix. We identify 73 topologies that can lead to genuine three-loop models
with fermions and scalars, i.e. models for which lower order diagrams are
automatically absent without the need to invoke additional symmetries. The 73
genuine topologies can be divided into two sub-classes: Normal genuine ones (44
cases) and special genuine topologies (29 cases). The latter are a special
class of topologies, which can lead to genuine diagrams only for very specific
choices of fields. The genuine topologies generate 374 diagrams in the weak
basis, which can be reduced to only 30 distinct diagrams in the mass eigenstate
basis. We also discuss how all the mass eigenstate diagrams can be described in
terms of only five master integrals. We present some concrete models and for
two of them we give numerical estimates for the typical size of neutrino masses

comparison of the optical spectral index, for a set of 40 RQWLQs with

at a high significance level, from that of blazars and is consistent with that
of the ordinary QSOs. Likewise, a structure-function analysis of photometric
light curves presented here suggests that the mechanism driving optical
variability in RQWLQs is similar to that operating in QSOs and different from

central engine in RQWLQs, as a population, is akin to that operating in normal
QSOs and the primary differences between them might be related to differences

galaxy gives access to the global dust attenuation of the stellar light. We
selected a sample of 30 GRBs for which the extinction curve along the GRB
afterglow line-of-sight (l.o.s) is measured in the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV)
up to optical and we analysed the properties of the extinction curve as a
function of the host galaxy properties. From these 30 GRBs, we selected seven
GRBHs with a good rest-frame UV to near infra-red spectral coverage for the
host. The attenuation curve was derived by fitting the SEDs of the GRBH sample
with the CIGALE SED fitting code. Different star formation histories were
studied to recover the star formation rates (SFR) derived using H$_{\alpha}$
luminosities. The most extinguished GRBs are preferentially found in the more
massive hosts and the UV bump is preferentially found in the most extinguished
GRB l.o.s. Five out of seven hosts are best fitted with a recent burst of star
formation, leading to lower stellar mass estimates than previously found. The
average attenuation in the host galaxies is about 70% of the amount of
extinction along the GRB l.o.s. We find a great variety in the derived
attenuation curves of GRBHs, the UV slope can be similar, flatter or even
steeper than the extinction curve slope. We find that the flatter (steeper)
attenuation curves are found in galaxies with the highest (lowest) SFR and

sequences and (b) adversarial loss sequences with small effective range of the
losses. While a number of algorithms have been proposed for exploiting small
effective range in the full information setting, Gerchinovitz and Lattimore
[2016] have shown the impossibility of regret scaling with the effective range
of the losses in the bandit setting. We show that just one additional
observation per round is sufficient to circumvent the impossibility result. The
proposed Second Order Difference Adjustments (SODA) algorithm requires no prior
knowledge of the effective range of the losses, $\varepsilon$, and achieves an
$O(\varepsilon \sqrt{KT \ln K}) + \tilde{O}(\varepsilon K \sqrt[4]{T})$
expected regret guarantee, where $T$ is the time horizon and $K$ is the number
of actions. The scaling with the effective loss range is achieved under
significantly weaker assumptions than those made by Cesa-Bianchi and Shamir

provide a regret lower bound of $\Omega(\varepsilon\sqrt{T K})$, which almost
matches the upper bound. In addition, we show that in the stochastic setting
SODA achieves an $O\left(\sum_{a:\Delta_a>0} \frac{K^3

might be sometimes acceptable to slowdown computations if the energy consumed

besides energy also have power dissipation limitations, while HPC centers have
a growing concern with electricity and cooling costs. Relying on power policies
to apply frequency/voltage scaling and/or change the CPU to idle states (e.g.,
alternate between power levels in bursts) as the main method to reduce energy
leaves potential for improvement using other orthogonal approaches. In this
work we evaluate the impact of compiler pass sequences specialization (also
known as compiler phase ordering) as a means to reduce the energy consumed by a
set of programs/functions when comparing with the use of the standard compiler
phase orders provided by, e.g., -OX flags. We use our phase selection and
ordering framework to explore the design space in the context of a Clang+LLVM
compiler targeting a multicore ARM processor in an ODROID board and a dual x86
desktop representative of a node in a Supercomputing center. Our experiments
with a set of representative kernels show that there we can reduce energy

partially explained by improvements to execution time. The experiments show
cases where applications that run faster consume more energy. Additionally, we

2011) is a continuous time dynamics coupling both the position and the
direction variables to efficiently locate the saddle point with a given index.
These saddle points play important roles in the activated process of the
randomly perturbed dynamical systems. For index-1 saddle points in non-gradient
systems, the GAD requires two direction variables to approximate the
eigenvectors of the Jacobian matrix and its transpose, respectively, while in
the gradient systems, these two directions collapse to be the single min mode
of the Hessian matrix. In this note, we present a simplified GAD which only
needs one direction variable even for non-gradient systems. This new method not
only reduces computational cost for directions by half, but also can avoid
inconvenient operations on the transpose of Jacobian matrix. We prove the same
convergence property for the simplified GAD as for the original GAD. The
motivation of our simplified GAD is its formal analogy to the Hamiltonian
dynamics governing the exit dynamics when the system is perturbed by small
noise. Several non-gradient examples are presented to demonstrate our method,
including the two dimensional models and the Allen-Cahn equation in the

field theories is reconsidered. Renewed interest in the computation of terms in
the epsilon-expansion, used to calculate critical exponents, has been
frustrated by the differing and incompatible results for the high-order
behaviour of the perturbation expansion reported in the literature. We identify
the sources of the errors made in earlier papers, correct them, and obtain a
consistent set of results. We focus on phi^4 theory, since this has been the
most studied and is the most widely used, but we also briefly discuss analogous
results for phi^N theory, with N>4. This reexamination of the structure of
perturbation expansions raises issues concerning the renormalisation of
non-perturbative effects and the nature of the Feynman diagrams at large order,
which we discuss.

temperature, mass, and projected separation all contribute to make it a test
case for the planet formation theories and for atmospheric models of giant
planets and light brown dwarfs. We collected data from the CHARA
interferometer, SOPHIE spectrograph, and VLT/SPHERE high contrast imager to
revisit the properties of the system. We measure a radius of 1.35+/- 0.04Rsun
for GJ504A which yields isochronal ages of 21+/-2Myr or 4.0+/-1.8Gyr for the
system and line-of-sight stellar rotation axis inclination of
$162.4_{-4.3}^{+3.8}$ degrees or $18.6_{-3.8}^{+4.3}$ degrees. We re-detect the
companion in the Y2, Y3, J3, H2, and K1 dual band SPHERE images. The complete
1-4 $\mu$m SED shape of GJ504b is best reproduced by T8-T9.5 objects with
intermediate ages ($\leq1.5$Gyr), and/or unusual dusty atmospheres and/or
super-solar metallicities. All six atmospheric models used yield
$\mathrm{T_{eff}=550 \pm 50}$K for GJ504b and point toward a low surface
gravity (3.5-4.0 dex). The accuracy on the metallicity value is limited by
model-to-model systematics. It is not degenerate with the C/O ratio. We derive
$\mathrm{log\:L/L_{\odot}=-6.15\pm0.15}$ dex for the companion compatible with
masses of $\mathrm{M=1.3^{+0.6}_{-0.3}M_{Jup}}$ and $\mathrm{M=23^{+10}_{-9}
M_{Jup}}$ for the young and old age ranges, respectively. The semi-major axis
(sma) is above 27.8 au and the eccentricity lower than 0.55. The posterior on
GJ~504b's orbital inclination suggests a misalignment with GJ~504A rotation
axis. We combine the radial velocity and multi-epoch imaging data to exclude
additional objects (90\% prob.) more massive than 2.5 and 30 $\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$
with sma in the range 0.01-80 au for the young and old system ages,
respectively. The companion is in the envelope of the population of planets
synthetized with our core-accretion model.

of an interaction with another galaxy. In particular, they may appear in disky

results of N-body/SPH simulations of such dwarfs orbiting in the static
potential of a larger galaxy. We used several models of the dwarf galaxy, all
of the same mass, but covering a large range of gas fractions: 0, 30 and 70%.
We also tested the impact of subgrid star formation processes. In all cases
bars of similar length formed in the stellar disk of the dwarfs at the first
pericenter passage. However, unexpectedly, the gaseous component remained
approximately axisymmetric and unaffected by the bar potential. The bar
properties did not change significantly between two consecutive pericenters.
The impact of the later encounters with the host depends strongly on the exact
orientation of the bar at the pericenter. When the bar is spun up by the tidal
force torque, it is also shortened. Conversely, if it is slowed down, it gets
longer. In the models with a low gas fraction the bars were more pronounced and
survived until the end of the simulations, while in the dwarfs with a high gas
fraction the bars were destroyed after the second or third pericenter passage.
In terms of the ratio of the corotation radius to the bar length, the bars are
slow, and remain so independently of the encounters with the host.

capture is particularly valuable, but the objects captured are more varied,

is an urban reconstruction algorithm which fuses GIS data, photogrammetric
meshes, and street level photography, to create clean representative,
semantically labelled, geometry. However, we have identified three problems
with the system i) the street level photography is often difficult to acquire;
ii) novel fa\c{c}ade styles often frustrate the detection of windows and doors;
iii) the computational requirements of the system are large, processing a large
city block can take up to 15 hours. In this paper we describe the process of
simplifying and validating the BigSUR semantic reconstruction system. In
particular, the requirement for street level images is removed, and greedy
post-process profile assignment is introduced to accelerate the system. We
accomplish this by modifying the binary integer programming (BIP) optimization,
and re-evaluating the effects of various parameters. The new variant of the
system is evaluated over a variety of urban areas. We objectively measure mean
squared error (MSE) terms over the unstructured geometry, showing that BigSUR
is able to accurately recover omissions from the input meshes. Further, we
evaluate the ability of the system to label the walls and roofs of input
meshes, concluding that our new BigSUR variant achieves highly accurate

Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process involving $N$ degrees of freedom. The
irreversibility of the process is encoded in the antisymmetric part of the
Onsager matrix. The linearity of the Langevin equations allows us to derive
closed-form expressions in terms of the latter matrix for many quantities of
interest, including the entropy production rate and the fluctuation-dissipation
ratio matrix. This general setting is then illustrated by two classes of
systems. First, we consider the one-dimensional ferromagnetic Gaussian spin
model endowed with a stochastic dynamics where spatial asymmetry results in
irreversibility. The stationary state on a ring is independent of the asymmetry
parameter, whereas it depends continuously on the latter on an open chain. Much
attention is also paid to finite-size effects, especially near the critical
point. Second, we consider arrays of resistively coupled electrical circuits.
The entropy production rate is evaluated in the regime where the local
temperatures of the resistors have small fluctuations. For $RL$ networks the
entropy production rate grows linearly with the size of the array. For $RC$
networks a quadratic growth law violating extensivity is predicted.

demonstrate a 2D-material heterostructure created on a fiber endface by
integrating a microscale multilayer graphene-MoS2-WS2 van der Waals (vdW)
heterostructure film on it. Hence, based on simple layer-by-layer transferring,
a visible-to-infrared gating-free all-in-fiber photodetector (FPD) is produced.
Our FPD exhibits an ultrahigh photoresponsivity of 6.6X107 A/W and a relatively
fast response speed of 7 ms at 400 nm light wavelength, due to the strong light
absorption and the built-in electric field of the heterostructure. Moreover,
owning to the type-II staggered band alignments in the MoS2-WS2
heterostructure, the interlayer optical transition between the MoS2 and WS2
layers enable our FPD to sense the infrared light power, displaying a
photoresponsivity of 17.1 A/W at 1550 nm. In addition, an inverse photoresponse
is observed under an illuminating power higher than 1 mW at 1550 nm, indicating
a competingphotocurrent generation mechanism, comprising the photoconductive

surface $\Sigma$, supports static solutions in which $k_+$ vortices coexist in

complex manifold $M_{(k_+,k_-)}(\Sigma)$ of dimension $k_++k_-$ which inherits
a natural K\""ahler metric $g_{L^2}$ governing the model's low energy dynamics.
This paper presents the first detailed study of $g_{L^2}$, focussing on the
geometry close to the boundary divisor $D=\partial M_{(k_+,k_-)}(\Sigma)$.
  On $\Sigma=S^2$, rigorous estimates of $g_{L^2}$ close to $D$ are obtained
which imply that $M_{(1,1)}(S^2)$ has finite volume and is geodesically
incomplete. On $\Sigma=\mathbb{R}^2$, careful numerical analysis and a
point-vortex formalism are used to conjecture asymptotic formulae for $g_{L^2}$
in the limits of small and large separation. All these results make use of a
localization formula, expressing $g_{L^2}$ in terms of data at the (anti)vortex
positions, which is established for general $M_{(k_+,k_-)}(\Sigma)$.
  For arbitrary compact $\Sigma$, a natural compactification of the space
$M_{(k_+,k_-)}(\Sigma)$ is proposed in terms of a certain limit of gauged
linear sigma models, leading to formulae for its volume and total scalar
curvature. The volume formula agrees with the result established for
$Vol(M_{(1,1)}(S^2))$, and allows for a detailed study of the thermodynamics of
vortex-antivortex gas mixtures. It is found that the equation of state is
independent of the genus of $\Sigma$, and that the entropy of mixing is always
positive.

its nature. A molecular $\Omega(2012)$ will also imply the existence of two-
and three-body molecular partners. The two-body partners comprise two $\Lambda$
hyperons located at $1740$ and $1950\,{\rm MeV}$ respectively, the first of
which might correspond to the $\Lambda(1800)$ while the second to the
$\Lambda(2000)$ or the $\Lambda(2050)$. The three-body partners include a
$\Xi(1530) K\bar{K}$ and a $\Xi(1530) \eta \bar{K}$ molecule, with masses of $M
= 2385-2445\,{\rm MeV}$ and $M = 2434-2503\,{\rm MeV}$ respectively. We might
be tempted to identify the first with the $\Xi(2370)$ and the latter with the
$\Omega(2470)$ listed in the PDG.

capability. It will be the fastest way to spectroscopically follow-up the
faintest sources, probing the reionisation epoch, as well as evaluating the
evolution of the dwarf mass function over most of the age of the Universe.
MOSAIC will be world-leading in generating an inventory of both the dark matter

warm-hot gas phases in z=3.5 galactic haloes (with visible wavelenth IFUs).
Galactic archaeology and the first massive black holes are additional targets
for which MOSAIC will also be revolutionary. MOAO and accurate sky subtraction
with fibres have now been demonstrated on sky, removing all low Technical

MOSAIC is feasible, and indeed could increase the robustness and reduce risk on
the ELT, since it does not require diffraction limited adaptive optics
performance. Science programmes and survey strategies are currently being

of the large resonant enhancement of the magnetic scattering close to the Ru

ways in which finite group representations and modular objects can be connected
to each other, and these developments have brought promises and also puzzles
into the string theory community.
  These lecture notes aim to bring graduate students in theoretical physics and
mathematical physics to the forefront of this active research area. In Part II
of this note, we review the various cases of moonshine connections, ranging
from the classical monstrous moonshine established in the last century to the
most recent findings. In Part III, we discuss the relation between the
moonshine connections and physics, especially string theory. After briefly
reviewing a recent physical realisation of monstrous moonshine, we will
describe in some details the mystery of the physical aspects of umbral
moonshine, and also mention some other setups where string theory black holes
can be connected to moonshine.
  To make the exposition self-contained, we also provide the relevant
background knowledge in Part I, including sections on finite groups, modular
objects, and two-dimensional conformal field theories. This part occupies half
of the pages of this set of notes and can be skipped by readers who are already

the weak gravitational regime when a plasma medium is taken into account. For
applications, we use these methods to introduce new general formulae for the
bending angle of light rays in plasma environments in different astrophysical
scenarios, generalizing previously known results. We also present new and
useful formulae for the separation angle between the images of two sources when
they are lensed by an astrophysical object surrounded by plasma. In particular,
for the case of an homogeneous plasma we study these corrections for the case
of light rays propagating near astrophysical objects described in the weak
gravitational regime by a Parametrized-Post-Newtonian (PPN) metric which takes
into account the mass of the objects and a possible quadrupole moment. Even
when our work concentrates on finite distances corrections to the deflection
angle, we also obtain as particular cases of our expressions new formulae which
are valid for the more common assumption of infinite distance between receiver,
lens and source. We also consider the presence of an inhomogeneous plasma media

the explicit one-loop computations of one-point and two-point functions it
becomes clear that---in addition---a renormalization of the vacuum expectation

functions of the physical scalar mass eigenfields, finite shifts of the
tree-level VEVs, induced by the finite parts of the tadpole diagrams, are
required. As a consequence of our renormalization scheme, physical masses are
functions of the renormalized parameters and VEVs and thus derived quantities.
Applying our scheme to one-loop corrections of lepton masses, we perform a
thorough discussion of finiteness and $\xi$-independence. In the latter
context, the tadpole contributions figure prominently.

enter in contact with the liquid lining the alveolar epithelium, the pulmonary
surfactant. The pulmonary surfactant is composed of lipids and proteins that
are assembled into large vesicular structures. The question of the nature of
the biophysicochemical interaction with the pulmonary surfactant is central to
understand how the nanoparticles can cross the air-blood barrier. Here we
explore the phase behavior of sub-100 nm particles and surfactant substitutes
in controlled conditions. Three types of surfactant mimetics, including the
exogenous substitute Curosurf, a drug administred to infants with respiratory
distress syndrome are tested together with aluminum oxide (Al2O3), silicon
dioxide (SiO2) and polymer (latex) nanoparticles. The main result here is the
observation of the spontaneous nanoparticle-vesicle aggregation induced by
Coulombic attraction. The role of the surface charges is clearly established.
We also evaluate the supported lipid bilayer formation recently predicted and
find that in the cases studied these structures do not occur. Pertaining to the
aggregate internal structure, fluorescence microscopy ascertains that the
vesicles and particles are intermixed at the nano- to microscale. With
particles acting as stickers between vesicles, it is anticipated that the
presence of inhaled nanomaterials in the alveolar spaces could significantly
modify the interfacial and bulk properties of the pulmonary surfactant and
interfere with the lung physiology.

velocities towards the footpoints reaching a peak velocity of up to 40 km/s in
the chromosphere. The temporal evolution of He I 10830 \AA\ profiles near the

applications as linearity of response, high dynamic range and a simple
calibration, however it requires a low-noise current readout. Usually, a
current amplifier based on Superconducting Quantum-Interference Device (SQUID)
is used for readout, but the scalability of this approach is limited due to
complexity of the operation and fabrication. Recently, it has been shown that
instead of SQUID it is possible to use a current sensor, which is based on the
nonlinearity of the kinetic inductance of a current-carrying superconducting
stripe. Embedding the stripe into a microwave high-Q superconducting resonator
allows for reaching sufficient current sensitivity. More important, it is
possible with the resonator approach to scale up to large arrays using
Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM) in GHz range. Here, we demonstrate the

(IPM) GANs.
  We show that this property can be induced by using a relativistic
discriminator which estimate the probability that the given real data is more
realistic than a randomly sampled fake data. We also present a variant in which
the discriminator estimate the probability that the given real data is more
realistic than fake data, on average. We generalize both approaches to
non-standard GAN loss functions and we refer to them respectively as
Relativistic GANs (RGANs) and Relativistic average GANs (RaGANs). We show that
IPM-based GANs are a subset of RGANs which use the identity function.
  Empirically, we observe that 1) RGANs and RaGANs are significantly more
stable and generate higher quality data samples than their non-relativistic
counterparts, 2) Standard RaGAN with gradient penalty generate data of better
quality than WGAN-GP while only requiring a single discriminator update per
generator update (reducing the time taken for reaching the state-of-the-art by
400%), and 3) RaGANs are able to generate plausible high resolutions images
(256x256) from a very small sample (N=2011), while GAN and LSGAN cannot; these
images are of significantly better quality than the ones generated by WGAN-GP
and SGAN with spectral normalization.

Unfortunately, local model is too strong for several important applications and
hence is limited in its applicability. In this work, we propose a framework

is optimal when the interference is sufficiently low. Scheduling algorithms
based on the TIN optimality condition have recently been proposed, e.g., for
application to device-to-device communications. TIN, however, has never been
applied to cellular networks. In this work, we propose a scheduling algorithm
for application to cellular networks that is based on the TIN optimality
condition. In the proposed scheduling algorithm, each base station (BS) first
randomly selects a user equipment (UE) in its coverage region, and then checks
the TIN optimality conditions. If the latter conditions are not fulfilled, the
BS is turned off. In order to assess the performance of TIN applied to cellular
networks, we introduce an analytical framework with the aid of stochastic
geometry theory. We develop, in particular, tractable expressions of the
signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) coverage probability and average
rate of cellular networks. In addition, we carry out asymptotic analysis to
find the optimal system parameters that maximize the SINR coverage probability.
By using the optimized system parameters, it is shown that TIN applied to
cellular networks yields significant gains in terms of SINR coverage
probability and average rate. Specifically, the numerical results show that
average rate gains of the order of $21\%$ over conventional scheduling
algorithms are obtained.

diffusion from Spin-On Doping (SOD) sources, Sb equilibrium diffusion from a
remote sputtered source and laser thermal annealing (LTA) of sputtered Sb.
Doping defects, thermally-activated during high temperature annealing, were
characterized through electrical measurements. A phenomenological model
describing the contamination process was developed and used to analyze the
diffusion parameters and possible process thermal windows. It resulted that
out-of-equilibrium doping processes confined to the HPGe surface have higher

  Each problem is handled through an appropriate reformulation into a linear

  Iteration",,,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The possibilities for limit functions on a Fatou component for the iteration
of a single polynomial or rational function are well understood and quite
restricted. In non-autonomous iteration, where one considers compositions of
arbitrary polynomials with suitably bounded degrees and coefficients, one
should observe a far greater range of behaviour. We show this is indeed the
case and we exhibit a bounded sequence of quadratic polynomials which has a
bounded Fatou component on which one obtains as limit functions every member of
the classical Schlicht family of normalized univalent functions on the unit
disc. The proof is based on quasiconformal surgery and the use of high iterates
of a quadratic polynomial with a Siegel disc which closely approximate the
identity on compact subsets. Careful bookkeeping using the hyperbolic metric is
required to control the errors in approximating the desired limit functions and
ensure that these errors ultimately tend to zero.

relate multiple system executions to each other. They are not expressible in
standard temporal logics, like LTL, CTL, and CTL*, and thus cannot be monitored
with standard runtime verification techniques. HyperLTL extends linear-time
temporal logic (LTL) with explicit quantification over traces in order to
express Hyperproperties. We investigate the runtime verification problem of
HyperLTL formulas for three different input models: (1) The parallel model,
where a fixed number of system executions is processed in parallel. (2) The
unbounded sequential model, where system executions are processed sequentially,
one execution at a time. In this model, the number of incoming executions may
grow forever. (3) The bounded sequential model where the traces are processed
sequentially and the number of incoming executions is bounded. We show that
deciding monitorability of HyperLTL formulas is PSPACE-complete for input
models (1) and (3). Deciding monitorability is PSPACE-complete for
alternation-free HyperLTL formulas in input model (2). For every input model,
we provide practical monitoring algorithms. We also present various
optimization techniques. By recognizing properties of specifications such as
reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity, we reduce the number of comparisons
between traces. For the sequential models, we present a technique that
minimized the number of traces that need to be stored. Finally, we provide an
optimization that succinctly represents the stored traces by sharing common
prefixes. We evaluate our optimizations, showing that this leads to much more
scalable monitoring, in particular, significantly lower memory consumption.

  Here we use molecular dynamics simulations of a model metallic glass to

the resulting spatial distribution of thermal expansion with a continuum

  Comparing the internal stress with the local yield stress, we prove that the

whether the fluid density which is an active field that reacts back on the
transporting flow and the passive concentration of tracers must coincide in the
steady state, which we demonstrate to be crucial both theoretically and
experimentally. The fields' coincidence is provable at small Mach numbers,
however at finite Mach numbers the assumption of mixing is needed, not evident
due to the possibility of self-organization. Irrespective of whether the fields
coincide we obtain a number of rigorous conclusions on both fields. As Ma
increases the fields in the inertial range go through a phase transition from a
finite continuous smooth to a singular multifractal distribution. We propose a
way to calculate fractal dimensions from numerical or experimental data. We
derive a simple expression for the spectrum of fractal dimensions of isothermal
turbulence and describe limitations of lognormality. The expression depends on
a single parameter: the scaling exponent of the density spectrum. We propose a
mechanism for the phase transition of concentration to multifractality. We
demonstrate that the pair-correlation function is invariant under the action of
the probability density function of the inter-pair distance that has the Markov
property implying applicability of the Kraichnan turbulence model. We use the
model to derive an explicit expression for the tracers pair correlation that
demonstrates their smooth transition to multifractality and confirms the
transition's mechanism. Our results are of potentially important implications

with a kind of metric bracket, for describing systems with both Hamiltonian and
dissipative components. The construction builds in asymptotic convergence to a
preselected equilibrium state. Phenomena such as friction, electric
resistivity, thermal conductivity and collisions in kinetic theories all fit
within this framework. In this paper an application of metriplectic dynamics is
presented that is of interest for the theory of control: a suitably chosen
torque, expressed through a metriplectic extension of its ""natural"" Poisson
algebra, an algebra obtained by reduction of a canonical Hamiltonian system, is
applied to a free rigid body. On a practical ground, the effect is to drive the
body to align its angular velocity to rotation about a stable principal axis of
inertia, while conserving its kinetic energy in the process. On theoretical
grounds, this example provides a class of non-Hamiltonian torques that can be
added to the canonical Hamiltonian description of the free rigid body and
reduce to metriplectic dissipation. In the canonical description these torques
provide convergence to a higher dimensional attractor. The method of

important source of charged Higgs in the Minimal Super Symmetric Standard

appear as a propagator in the form of heavy resonance state decaying to a pair
of top and bottom quark. The process under investigation is $pp \rightarrow
H^{\pm}\rightarrow tb \rightarrow b\bar{b}W^{\pm} \rightarrow
b\bar{b}\tau^{\pm} \nu_{\tau}$, where top quark exclusively decays into a pair
of bottom quark and W boson while W boson subsequently decays to $\tau$ jet and
neutrino. So the final state is characterized by the presence of two b jets,
hadronic $\tau$ decay and missing transverse energy. Within the presence of QCD
multijet and electroweak background events at LHC, it has been demonstrated
that the charged Higgs signal observability is possible within the available
MSSM parameter space (tan$\beta$, $m_{H^{\pm}})$ respecting all experimental

charged Higgs, the exclusion curves at 95$\%$ confidence level and 5$\sigma$

end, we introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN) based weakly supervised
slice-propagated segmentation (WSSS) method to 1) generate the initial lesion
segmentation on the axial RECIST-slice; 2) learn the data distribution on
RECIST-slices; 3) extrapolate to segment the whole lesion slice by slice to
finally obtain a volumetric segmentation. To validate the proposed method, we
first test its performance on a fully annotated lymph node dataset, where WSSS
performs comparably to its fully supervised counterparts. We then test on a
comprehensive lesion dataset with 32,735 RECIST marks, where we report a mean

gravity (EMSG) that allows different gravitational couplings for different
types of sources, which may lead to scenarios with many interesting
applications/implications in cosmology. In the present study, to begin with, we
study a modification of the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model,
where photons and baryons couple to the spacetime as in general relativity,
while the cold dark matter and relativistic relics (neutrinos and any other
relativistic relics) couple to the spacetime in accordance with EMSG. This
scenario induces pseudo nonminimal interactions on these components, leading to
modification at both the background and perturbative levels. A consequence of
this scenario is that the dimensionless free parameter of the theory may induce
direct changes on the effective number of the relativistic species, without the
need to introduce new extra species. In order to quantify the observational
consequences of the cosmological scenario, we use the cosmic microwave
background Planck data (temperature, polarization, and lensing power spectrum)
and baryonic acoustic oscillations data. We find that the free model parameter
is too small to induce statistically significant corrections on the
$\Lambda$CDM model due to EMSG. We deduce that the model presented here is
quite rich with promising cosmological applications/implications that deserve
further investigations.

images contain information about the cardiovascular system that often remains
latent due to the lack of contrast in the cardiac area. On the other hand, the
contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) represents an imaging technique
that allows to easily assess the cardiac chambers volumes and the contrast
dynamics. With this work we aim to face the problem of extraction and
presentation of these latent information, using a deep learning approach with
convolutional neural networks. Starting from the extraction of relevant
features from the image without contrast medium, we try to re-map them on
features typical of CECT, to synthesize an image characterized by an
attenuation in the cardiac chambers as if a virtually iodine contrast medium
was injected. The purposes are to guarantee an estimation of the left cardiac
chambers volume and to perform an evaluation of the contrast dynamics. Our
approach is based on a deconvolutional network trained on a set of 120 patients
who underwent both CT acquisitions in the same contrastographic arterial phase
and the same cardiac phase. To ensure a reliable predicted CECT image, in terms
of values and morphology, a custom loss function is defined by combining an
error function to find a pixel-wise correspondence, which takes into account
the similarity in term of Hounsfield units between the input and output images
and by a cross-entropy computed on the binarized versions of the synthesized
and of the real CECT image. The proposed method is finally tested on 20

subjects, to investigate forward fall-related injuries. The MADYMO human body
model is capable of simulating items that cannot be assessed on human subjects,
such as human kinematics, human dynamics, and the possibility of injuries. In
order to achieve our goal, a set of experiments was conducted to measure the
impact force during a worst-case forward fall scenario (the outstretched hand
position) for two short fall heights. Similar to the experimental design used
on the human subjects, we generated a MADYMO human model. After performing the
simulations, the results of the experiment on the human subjects and the MADYMO
simulation model were compared. We demonstrated a significant correlation

the magnitude and timing of the impact forces. Consequently, we validated the
MADYMO human body model as a means to accurately assess forward fall-related
injuries. Additionally, we compared the predicted results of a mathematical
model with the MADYMO human body model. The MADYMO model is reliable and can
demonstrate an accurate impact time. Therefore, we conclude that the MADYMO

fall-related injuries from a typical standing position.

structure study. At an elementary level I propose a new angular momentum
separation for the massless Dirac field in a free theory which mimics the usual
free photon angular momentum separation pattern in Coulomb gauge. In connection
with this construction I introduce a somewhat idiosyncratic formalism in a free
massless Dirac theory which I call ""dressed axial $U(1)_A$ symmetry"". I show
that this new ""fermion spin operator"", which is more correctly called ""helicity
vector operator"", can be incorporated into this new symmetry pattern in a
natural way. This set of ""dressed axial vector current"" and its corresponding
charges show an interesting internal structure and may be useful in a broader
physical context. I then discuss the case of the QED model with a massless
Dirac fermion. In the case of covariant quantization, I give a new and correct
proof that the additional term in the total angular momentum operator stemming
from the gauge-fixing term does not contribute at the level of physical matrix
elements, which is discussed in the relevant literature. At the level of
asymptotic fields I construct the helicity vector operator of the QED theory
which actually coincides with the usual projection of the total angular
momentum operator when acting on a beam of collinearly moving free particles. I
then consider the QCD model with only two massless light quarks. In this
context I discuss the approximate concept of ""asymptotic quark and gluon
fields"" which is relevant to the usual parton model picture and propose to use
the asymptotic ""quark helicity vector"" operator to describe the quark helicity
contribution to an IMF proton. Finally, I give some remarks on the concept of
IMF itself, which show that this very concept should be understood with some
reservation from a rigorous mathematical consideration.

identify this missing boundary term with the dark energy density and express it

fermionic field, sometimes called Elko field. The equilibrium partition
function was calculated by means of the imaginary time formalism and the result
obtained was the same for a Dirac fermion field, even though the Elko field
does not satisfy a Dirac like equation. The high and low temperature limits
were obtained, and for the last case the degeneracy pressure due to Pauli
exclusion principle can be responsible for the dark matter halos around
galaxies to be greater than or of the same order of the galaxy radius. Also,
for a light particle of about $0.1$eV and a density of just 0.1 particle per
cubic centimeter, the value of the total dark matter mass due to Elko particles
is of the same order of a typical galaxy. Such a result satisfactorily explains
the dark matter as being formed just by Elko fermionic particles and also the
existence of galactic halos that go beyond the observable limit.

problem is formulated as a problem of detecting deviations from learned
cyclostationary behavior. Sequential algorithms are proposed to detect
anomalies using the proposed model. The proposed algorithms are shown to be
asymptotically efficient in a well-defined sense. The developed algorithms are

  appendices are of reduced image quality. For a version with better quality
  images (30 MB file), please contact the author",,,,"q-fin.GN nlin.AO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since Bachelier's thesis in 1900 (laying the foundation of the stochastic
process, or Brownian motion, as a model of stock price changes), attempts at
understanding the nature of prices and at predicting them have failed.
Statistical methods have only found minor regularities/anomalies, and other
mathematical and physical approaches do not work. This leads researchers to
consider that the evolution of security prices is basically random, and, thus,
inherently not predictable. We show that the evolution of security prices is
not a stochastic process but largely deterministic and governed by a physical
law. The law takes the form of a physicomathematical theory centered around a
purely mathematical function, unrelated to models and statistical methods. It
can be described as an ""isodense"" network of moving regression curves of an
order greater than or equal to 1. The salient aspect of the function is that,
when inputting a time series of any security into the function, new
mathematical objects emerge spontaneously, and these objects exhibit the unique
property of attracting and repelling the quantity. The graphical representation
of the function is called a ""topological network"" due to the preeminence of
shapes over metrics, and the emergent objects are called ""characteristic
figures"" (mainly ""cords""). The attraction and repulsion of the price by the
cords results in the price bouncing from cord to cord. Thus, the price has to
be considered as driven by the cords in a semi-deterministic manner (leaning
towards deterministic). With a function that describes the evolution of the
price, we now understand the reason behind each price movement and can also
predict prices both qualitatively and quantitatively. The function is
universal, does not rely on any fitting, and, due to its extreme sensitivity,
reveals the hidden order in financial time series data that existing research
never uncovered.

spring. We take advantage of the diamagnetic property of pyrolytic carbon to
make an elementary levitated system. It is equivalent to a torsional
spring-mass-damper system consisting of a small pyrolytic carbon disc levitated
above a permanent magnet array. There are several possible measurement modes.
In this paper, only the angular response to an optical power single-step is
described. An optical detection composed of a laser diode, a mirror and a
position sensitive detector (PSD) allow measurement of the angular deflection
proportional to the voltage delivered by the PSD. Once the parameters of the
levitated system depending on its geometrical and physical characteristics have
been determined regardless of any optical power, by applying a simple physical
law, one can deduce the value of the optical power to be measured from the
measurement of the first maximum of the output voltage amplitude.
