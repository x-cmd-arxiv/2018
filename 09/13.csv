divergence free framework for QCD and the electroweak theory in curved
space-time. The starting point of the theory is the notion of covariance which
is interpreted as (4D) conformal covariance rather than the general
(diffeomorphism) covariance of general relativity. Fock space which is a graded
algebra composed of tensor valued function spaces associated with spaces of
multiparticle bosonic or fermionic states is defined concretely. Algebra
bundles whose typical fibers are algebras such as the Fock algebra are defined.
Scattering processes are associated with linear maps between fibers in such
bundles. Such linear maps can be generated by linear operators between the
multiparticle function spaces which intertwine with the actions of the group
$SU(3)$ associated with the strong interaction and a group locally isomorphic
to $SL(2,{\bf C})\times U(1)$ which is associated with the electroweak
interaction and such intertwining, or covariant, operators may be generated by
covariant integral kernels. It is shown how quark-quark scattering and
gluon-gluon scattering are associated with such covariant kernels. The rest of
the paper focuses on QCD vacuum polarization in order to compute and display
the QCD running coupling. Through an application of the technique called
spectral regularization the densities associated with the quark, gluon and
ghost bubbles are computed without requiring renormalization and hence the QCD
vacuum polarization tensor is determined. It is found that the spectral QCD
running coupling does not manifest a Landau pole and has the property known as
""freezing of $\alpha_s$"" in the infrared.

that may be challenging to realize in solid state materials such as SO coupled
spin-1 fermions. While one-dimensional SO coupling for spin-1 bosons has been
experimentally realized, the generation of two-dimensional (2D) SO coupling and
its topological properties are largely unexplored. Here we propose an
experimental scheme for realizing a 2D Dresselhaus-type SO coupling in a square
lattice for spin-1 Fermi gases. Because of the extended spin degree of freedom,
many interesting topological phases could exist without relying on lattice
point group symmetries that are crucial in solid state materials. These exotic
phases include triply-degenerate points, quadratic band touching, a large Chern

scheme can be generalized to larger spins and provides a new route for
engineering topological quantum matter by utilizing large spin degrees of
freedom, instead of specific lattice symmetries.

lugsail equivalent with no additional assumptions. We use these lag windows
within spectral variance estimators and demonstrate its advantages in a linear

employ the lugsail lag windows in weighted batch means estimators due to their
computational efficiency on large simulation output. We obtain bias and
variance results for these multivariate estimators and significantly weaken the
mixing condition on the process. Superior finite-sample properties are
illustrated in a vector autoregressive process and a Bayesian logistic

use a one-dimensional photochemistry model to calculate the abundance of O2 and
other key species, for outgassing rates ranging from a Venus-like volcanic

of the atmosphere and the ocean, and includes the pressure dependency of
outgassing on the surface pressure. Our calculations show that the surface
pressure is a controlling parameter in the photochemical stability and oxygen
buildup of CO2-dominated atmospheres. The mixing ratio of O2 monotonically
decreases as the surface pressure increases at the very high outgassing rates,
whereas it increases as the surface pressure increases at the lower-than-Earth
outgassing rates. Abiotic O2 can only build up to the detectable level, defined
as 1e-3 in volume mixing ratio, in 10-bar atmospheres with the Venus-like
volcanic activity rate and the reduced outgassing rate of H2 due to the high

interpretability. To address this accuracy-interpretability challenge, we here
introduce, for the first time, a text categorization approach that leverages
the recently introduced Tsetlin Machine. In all brevity, we represent the terms
of a text as propositional variables. From these, we capture categories using
simple propositional formulae, such as: if ""rash"" and ""reaction"" and
""penicillin"" then Allergy. The Tsetlin Machine learns these formulae from a
labelled text, utilizing conjunctive clauses to represent the particular facets
of each category. Indeed, even the absence of terms (negated features) can be
used for categorization purposes. Our empirical comparison with Na\""ive Bayes,
decision trees, linear support vector machines (SVMs), random forest, long
short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, and other techniques, is quite
conclusive. The Tsetlin Machine either performs on par with or outperforms all
of the evaluated methods on both the 20 Newsgroups and IMDb datasets, as well
as on a non-public clinical dataset. On average, the Tsetlin Machine delivers
the best recall and precision scores across the datasets. Finally, our GPU
implementation of the Tsetlin Machine executes 5 to 15 times faster than the
CPU implementation, depending on the dataset. We thus believe that our novel
approach can have a significant impact on a wide range of text analysis
applications, forming a promising starting point for deeper natural language
understanding with the Tsetlin Machine.

cross-correlation for Planck HFI frequencies 217, 353, 545 and 857 GHz and IRAS
3000 GHz. We predict a positive cross-correlation between the CIB and CMB whose
amplitude decreases rapidly at small scales. We perform a signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) analysis on this cross-correlation. In the ideal case of the
cross-correlation obtained over 70% (40%) of the sky with no residual
contaminants (e.g. galactic dust) in maps, the SNR ranges from 4.2-5.6
(3.2-4.3) with the highest for 857 GHz. A Fisher matrix analysis shows that an
ISW signal detected with such high SNR on the 40% sky can improve the
constraints on the cosmological parameters considerably; constraints on the
equation of state of the dark energy are improved by 80%. We then perform a
more realistic analysis with the effect of residual galactic dust contamination
in CIB maps. We calculate the dust power spectra for several frequencies and
sky fractions which dominate over CIB at lower multipoles we are interested in.
Considering conservative 10% residual level of galactic dust in the CIB power
spectra, we find that the SNR drops drastically making ISW detection difficult.
To check the capability of current maps to detect ISW via this method, we
measure the cross-correlation of the CIB and the CMB Planck maps on so called
GASS field covering an area of 11% in the southern hemisphere. We find that
with such a small sky fraction and dust residuals present in CIB maps, we do
not detect ISW signal and the measured signal is consistent with zero. In order
not to degrade the SNR for the ISW measurement by more than 10% on the 40% sky,
we find that the dust needs to be cleaned up to 0.01% level on the power
spectrum.

manually tune the hyper-parameters, or utilize automated techniques such as
those based on Bayesian optimization. Both of these approaches are
time-consuming since they involve repeatably training the model for different
sets of hyper-parameters. A number of software GBDT packages have started to
offer GPU acceleration which can help to alleviate this problem. In this paper,
we consider three such packages: XGBoost, LightGBM and Catboost. Firstly, we
evaluate the performance of the GPU acceleration provided by these packages
using large-scale datasets with varying shapes, sparsities and learning tasks.
Then, we compare the packages in the context of hyper-parameter optimization,
both in terms of how quickly each package converges to a good validation score,
and in terms of generalization performance.

  Exclusion Algorithm for CC and DSM Models","19 pages with appendix and references",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The abortable mutual exclusion problem was introduced by Scott and Scherer to
meet a need that arises in database and real time systems, where processes
sometimes have to abandon their attempt to acquire a mutual exclusion lock to
initiate recovery from a potential deadlock or to avoid overshooting a
deadline. Algorithms of O(1) RMR complexity have been known for the standard
mutual exclusion problem for both the Cache-Coherent (CC) and Distributed
Shared Memory (DSM) models of multiprocessors, but whether O(1) RMR complexity
is also achievable for abortable mutual exclusion has remained open for the 18
years that this problem has been investigated.
  Jayanti gives a Theta(log n) worst case RMR complexity solution for both
models, where n is the maximum number of processes that execute the algorithm
concurrently. Giakouppis and Woelfel's algorithm, presented at PODC last year,
is an O(1) amortized complexity algorithm, but it works only for the CC model,
uses randomization, does not satisfy Starvation Freedom, and the O(1) amortized
bound holds only in expectation and is proven for the a weak (oblivious)
adversary model.
  We design an algorithm that is free of these limitations: our algorithm is
deterministic, supports fast aborts (a process completes an abort in O(1)
steps), has a small space complexity of O(n), requires hardware support for
only the Fetch&Store instruction, satisfies a novely defined First Come First
Served for abortable locks, and most importantly, has O(1) amortized RMR
complexity for both the CC and DSM models. Our algorithm is short and practical
with fewer than a dozen lines of code, and is accompanied by a rigorous proof
of mutual exclusion through invariants and of starvation-freedom and complexity
analysis through distance and potential functions. Thus, modulo amortization,
our result answers affirmatively the long standing open question described
above.

to manipulate their electronic properties, which are fundamentally influenced
by periodic potential landscapes. In 2D materials, a moir\'e pattern with a
superlattice potential can form by vertically stacking two layered materials
with a twist and/or finite lattice constant difference. This unique approach
has led to emergent electronic phenomena, including the fractal quantum Hall
effect, tunable Mott insulators, and unconventional superconductivity.
Furthermore, theory predicts intriguing effects on optical excitations by a
moir\'e potential in 2D valley semiconductors, but these signatures have yet to
be experimentally detected. Here, we report experimental evidence of interlayer
valley excitons trapped in a moir\'e potential in MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$
heterobilayers. At low temperatures, we observe photoluminescence near the free
interlayer exciton energy but with over 100 times narrower linewidths. The
emitter g-factors are homogeneous across the same sample and only take two
values, -15.9 and 6.7, in samples with twisting angles near 60{\deg} and 0\deg,
respectively. The g-factors match those of the free interlayer exciton, which
is determined by one of two possible valley pairing configurations. At a twist
angle near 20\deg, the emitters become two orders of magnitude dimmer, but
remarkably, they possess the same g-factor as the heterobilayer near 60\deg.
This is consistent with the Umklapp recombination of interlayer excitons near
the commensurate 21.8{\deg} twist angle. The emitters exhibit strong circular
polarization, which implies the preservation of three-fold rotation symmetry by
the trapping potential. Together with the power and excitation energy
dependence, all evidence points to their origin as interlayer excitons trapped
in a smooth moir\'e potential with inherited valley-contrasting physics.

mutants, to the source code and checking whether the test suite fails (i.e.,
whether the mutant is killed). Recent work has shown cases in which applying
multiple changes, called a higher order mutation, is more difficult to kill
than a single change, called a first order mutation. Specifically, a special
kind of higher order mutation, called a strongly subsuming higher order
mutation (SSHOM), can enable equivalent accuracy in assessing the quality of
the test suite with fewer executions of tests. Little is known about these
SSHOMs, as they are difficult to find. Our goal in this research is to identify
a faster, more reliable method for finding SSHOMs in order to characterize them
in the future. We propose an approach based on variational execution to find
SSHOMs. Preliminary results indicate that variational execution performs better
than the existing genetic algorithm in terms of speed and completeness of

work, we first show that there exists a convex loss function for which the
stability gap for multiple epochs of SGD with standard heavy-ball momentum
(SGDM) becomes unbounded. Then, for smooth Lipschitz loss functions, we analyze
a modified momentum-based update rule, i.e., SGD with early momentum (SGDEM),
and show that it admits an upper-bound on the generalization error. Thus, our
results show that machine learning models can be trained for multiple epochs of
SGDEM with a guarantee for generalization. Finally, for the special case of
strongly convex loss functions, we find a range of momentum such that multiple
epochs of standard SGDM, as a special form of SGDEM, also generalizes.
Extending our results on generalization, we also develop an upper-bound on the
expected true risk, in terms of the number of training steps, the size of the

a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) backbone with the energetic component represented

describe the firehose instability, whose dynamics plays a key role in
throttling reconnection and in controlling the spectra of energetic particles.
The results of early tests of the model, including the propagation of Alfven

Here $X=(x_{ij})$ is an $n\times N$ random matrix with $x_{ij}=N^{-1/2}q_{ij}$,
where $q_{ij}$ are $i.i.d.$ random variables with zero mean and unit variance,

high-dimensional case, i.e. ${n}/{N}\to d \in (0, \infty)$ as $N\to \infty$.
Assuming $\mathbb E q_{ij}^3=0$ and some mild conditions on $A$ and $B$, we
prove that the limiting distribution of the largest eigenvalue of $\mathcal Q$
coincide with that of the corresponding Gaussian ensemble (i.e. the $\mathcal

sharp moment condition for edge universality. If we take $B=I$, then $\mathcal
Q$ becomes the normal sample covariance matrix and the edge universality holds
true without the vanishing third moment condition. So far, this is the
strongest edge universality result for sample covariance matrices with
correlated data (i.e. non-diagonal $A$) and heavy tails, which improves the

GZK process ($\geq$100 PeV). Here we describe the $\textit{NuPhase}$ detector,
which is a compact receiving array of low-gain antennas deployed 185 m deep in
glacial ice near the South Pole. Signals from the antennas are digitized and
coherently summed into multiple beams to form a low-threshold interferometric
phased array trigger for radio impulses. The NuPhase detector was installed at
an Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) station during the 2017/18 Austral summer season.
$\textit{In situ}$ measurements with an impulsive, point-source calibration
instrument show a 50% trigger efficiency on impulses with voltage
signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of $\le$2.0, a factor of $\sim$1.8 improvement in
SNR over the standard ARA combinatoric trigger. Hardware-level simulations,
validated with $\textit{in situ}$ measurements, predict a trigger threshold of
an SNR as low as 1.6 for neutrino interactions that are in the far field of the
array. With the already-achieved NuPhase trigger performance included in
ARASim, a detector simulation for the ARA experiment, we find the trigger-level
effective detector volume is increased by a factor of 1.8 at neutrino energies
between 10 and 100 PeV compared to the currently used ARA combinatoric trigger.
We also discuss an achievable near term path toward lowering the trigger
threshold further to an SNR of 1.0, which would increase the effective
single-station volume by more than a factor of 3 in the same range of neutrino
energies.

reversed by applying an electric field. In metals, the itinerant electrons tend
to screen electrostatic forces between ions, helping to explain why polar
metals are very rare. Screening also excludes external electric fields,
apparently ruling out the possibility of polarity reversal and thus
ferroelectric switching. In principle, however, a thin enough polar metal could
be penetrated by an electric field sufficiently to be switched. Here we show
that the layered topological semimetal WTe2 provides the first embodiment of
this principle. Although monolayer WTe2 is centrosymmetric and thus nonpolar,
the stacked bulk structure is polar. We find that two- or three-layer WTe2
exhibits a spontaneous out-of-plane electric polarization which can be switched
using gate electrodes. We directly detect and quantify the polarization using
graphene as an electric field sensor. Moreover, the polarization states can be
differentiated by conductivity, and the carrier density can be varied to modify
the properties. The critical temperature is above 350 K, and even when WTe2 is
sandwiched in graphene it retains its switching capability at room temperature,
demonstrating a robustness suitable for applications in combination with other

result, two additional features in addition to prediction quality have
generated interest: (i) to facilitate human interaction and understanding with
these algorithms, we desire prediction functions that are in some fashion
simple or interpretable; and (ii) because they influence consequential
decisions, we also want them to produce equitable allocations. We develop a
formal model to explore the relationship between the demands of simplicity and
equity. Although the two concepts appear to be motivated by qualitatively
distinct goals, we show a fundamental inconsistency between them. Specifically,
we formalize a general framework for producing simple prediction functions, and
in this framework we establish two basic results. First, every simple
prediction function is strictly improvable: there exists a more complex
prediction function that is both strictly more efficient and also strictly more
equitable. Put another way, using a simple prediction function both reduces
utility for disadvantaged groups and reduces overall welfare relative to other
options. Second, we show that simple prediction functions necessarily create
incentives to use information about individuals' membership in a disadvantaged
group --- incentives that weren't present before simplification, and that work
against these individuals. Thus, simplicity transforms disadvantage into bias
against the disadvantaged group. Our results are not only about algorithms but
about any process that produces simple models, and as such they connect to the
psychology of stereotypes and to an earlier economics literature on statistical
discrimination.

dangerously irrelevant perturbation at the clean Ising critical point, leading
to a state we call the critical Ising insulator. In this state, thermodynamics

all finite-energy excitations are localized, thermal transport vanishes, and

this line of hyperuniform critical points using a combination of perturbation

recent study shows that the young intermediate-mass star cluster VVV CL041
possibly hosts a >80 Msun star, WR62-2, which appears to violate the existence
of the m_max-M_ecl relation since the mass of the star is almost two times
higher than that expected from the relation. By performing direct N-body
calculations with the same mass as the cluster VVV CL041 (3000 Msun), we study
whether such a very massive star can be formed via dynamically induced stellar
collisions in a binary-rich star cluster that initially follows the m_max-M_ecl

through multiple stellar collisions. This suggests that the VVV CL041 cluster
may have become an outlier of the relation because of its early-dynamical
evolution, even if the cluster followed the relation at birth. We find that
more than half of our model clusters host a merger product as its most massive
member within the first 5 Myr of cluster evolution. Thus, the existence of
stars more massive than the m_max-M_ecl relation in some young clusters is
expected due to dynamical processes despite the validity of the m_max-M_ecl

particle-physics studies. A particular case is the discrimination, or tagging,
between a boosted jet originated from an electroweak boson (signal), and a
standard QCD parton (background). A common way to achieve this is to cut on a
measure of the radiation inside the jet, i.e. a jet shape. Over the last few
years, analytic calculations of jet substructure have allowed for a deeper
understanding of these tools and for the development of more efficient ones.
However, analytic calculations are often limited to the region where the jet
shape is small. In this paper we introduce a new approach in perturbative QCD
to compute jet shapes for a generic boosted jets, waiving the above limitation.
We focus on an example common in the substructure literature: the jet mass
distribution after a cut on the $N$-subjettiness $\tau_{21}$ ratio, extending
previous works to the region relevant for phenomenology. We compare our
analytic predictions to Monte Carlo simulations for both plain and

invariant probability density distribution function of initial stellar masses
being represented by the canonical IMF. As a consequence the galaxy-wide IMF
(gwIMF), defined as the sum of the IMFs of all star forming regions, should
also be invariant. Recent observational and theoretical results challenge the
hypothesis that the gwIMF is invariant. In order to study the possible reasons
for this variation we use the IMF determined in resolved star clusters and
apply the IGIMF-theory to calculate a grid of gwIMF models for metallicities,
-3<[Fe/H]<1, and galaxy-wide star formation rates,
$10^{-5}$<SFR<$10^{5}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}/yr}$. For a galaxy with metallicy
[Fe/H]$<0$ and SFR$\,> 1\,M_\odot$/yr, which is a common condition in the early
Universe, we find that the gwIMF is top-heavy (more massive stars), when
compared to the canonical IMF. For a SFR $< 1\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}/yr}$ the gwIMF
becomes top-light regardless of the metallicity. For metallicities
$\mathrm{[Fe/H]} > 0$ the gwIMF can become bottom-heavy regardless of the SFR.
The IGIMF models predict that massive elliptical galaxies should have formed
with a gwIMF that is top-heavy within the first few hundred Myr of the galaxy's
life and that it evolves into a bottom-heavy gwIMF in the metal-enriched
galactic center. We study the SFR$-$H$\alpha$ relation, its dependency on
metallicity and the SFR, the correction factors to the Kennicutt SFR$_{\rm
K}-$H$\alpha$ relation, and provide new fitting functions Late-type dwarf
galaxies show significantly higher SFRs with respect to Kennicutt SFRs, while
star forming massive galaxies have significantly lower SFRs than hitherto
thought. This has implications for the gas-consumption time scales and for the

used it to evolve a sample of $1.5\times{}10^8$ binary systems, with
metallicity in the range $\left[10^{-4};4\times 10^{-2}\right]$. From our

only single stellar evolution. The maximum BH mass we obtain is $\sim 30$, $45$

unlikely to merge within a Hubble time. In our simulations, merging BHs like
GW151226 and GW170608, form at all metallicities, the high-mass systems (like

practice of most $N$-body studies, we do not assume that all stars are formed
at once. Rather, we explore the effects of different star formation rates on
the global structure and evolution of young embedded star clusters, also
considering various primordial binary fractions and mass segregation levels.
Our fiducial clumps studied in this paper have initial masses of $M_{\rm cl} =
3000\,M_\odot$, are embedded in ambient cloud environments of $\Sigma_{\rm
cloud} = 0.1$ and 1 g cm$^{-2}$, and gradually form stars with an overall
efficiency of 50% until the gas is exhausted. We investigate star formation
efficiencies per free-fall time in the range $\epsilon_{\rm ff}=0.01$ to 1, and
also compare to the instantaneous case ($\epsilon_{\rm ff}=\infty$) of Paper I.
We show that most of the interesting dynamical processes that determine the
future of the cluster, happen during the early formation phase. In particular,
the ejected stellar population is sensitive to the duration of star cluster
formation: for example, clusters with longer formation times produce more
runaway stars, since these clusters remain in a dense state for longer, thus
favouring occurrence of dynamical ejections. We also show that the presence of
radial age gradients in star clusters depends sensitively on the star formation
efficiency per free fall time, with observed values being matched best by our
slowest forming clusters with $\epsilon_{\rm ff}\lesssim0.03$.

flux in situ, even when starting from a purely toroidal magnetic field. The
flux accumulates around the BH till it becomes dynamically-important, leads to
a magnetically arrested disc (MAD), and launches relativistic jets that are
more powerful than the accretion flow. The jet power exceeds that of previous
GRMHD toroidal field simulations by a factor of 10,000. The jets do not show

black holes (BSBHs). We identified a sample of 16 BSBH candidates based on
two-epoch spectroscopy among 52 quasars with significant RV shifts over a few
rest-frame years. The candidates showed consistent velocity shifts
independently measured from two broad lines (H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ or Mg${\rm
\,II}$) without significant changes in the broad-line profiles. Here in the
third paper of the series, we present further third- and fourth-epoch
spectroscopy for 12 of the 16 candidates for continued RV tests, spanning
$\sim$5--15 yr in the quasars' rest frames. Cross-correlation analysis of the
broad H$\beta$ calibrated against [O${\rm\,III}]\,\lambda 5007$ suggests that 5
of the 12 quasars remain valid as BSBH candidates. They show broad H$\beta$ RV
curves that are consistent with binary orbital motion without significant
changes in the broad line profiles. Their broad H$\alpha$ (or Mg${\rm \,II}$)
lines display RV shifts that are either consistent with or smaller than those
seen in broad H$\beta$. The RV shifts can be explained by a $\sim$0.05--0.1 pc
BSBH with an orbital period of $\sim$40--130 yr, assuming a mass ratio of
0.5--2 and a circular orbit. However, the parameters are not well constrained
given the few epochs that sample only a small portion of the hypothesized
binary orbital cycle. The apparent occurrence rate of sub-pc BSBHs is
$\lesssim$13$\pm$5% among all SDSS quasars, with no significant difference in
the subsets with and without single-epoch broad line velocity offsets.
Dedicated long-term spectroscopic monitoring is still needed to further confirm
or reject these BSBH candidates.

by showing that the classical perturbative double copy of pions corresponds to
special Galileons. We consider point-particles coupled to the relevant scalar

considering couplings motivated by those that would arise from extracting the
longitudinal modes of the gauge and gravity theories, we are able to map the
non-linear sigma model radiation to that of the special Galileon. We also
construct the single copy by mapping the bi-adjoint scalar radiation to the

  reaction networks",,,,,"q-bio.MN math.DS math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reaction networks are mathematical models of interacting chemical species
that are primarily used in biochemistry. There are two modeling regimes that
are typically used, one of which is deterministic and one that is stochastic.
In particular, the deterministic model consists of an autonomous system of
differential equations, whereas the stochastic system is a continuous time
Markov chain. Connections between the two modeling regimes have been studied
since the seminal paper by Kurtz (1972), where the deterministic model is shown
to be a limit of a properly rescaled stochastic model over compact time
intervals. Further, more recent studies have connected the long-term behaviors
of the two models when the reaction network satisfies certain graphical
properties, such as weak reversibility and a deficiency of zero.
  These connections have led some to conjecture a link between the long-term
behavior of the two models exists, in some sense. In particular, one is tempted
to believe that positive recurrence of all states for the stochastic model
implies the existence of positive equilibria in the deterministic setting, and
that boundary equilibria of the deterministic model imply the occurrence of an
extinction event in the stochastic setting. We prove in this paper that these
implications do not hold in general, even if restricting the analysis to
networks that are bimolecular and that conserve the total mass. In particular,
we disprove the implications in the special case of models that have absolute
concentration robustness, thus answering in the negative a conjecture stated in
the literature in 2014.

study the proximity effect both in the longitudinal as well as in the

lines originating from the vicinity of quasars to those originating from the
general inter-galactic medium at the same redshift. We found an enhancement in
the transmitted flux within 4 Mpc to the quasar in the longitudinal direction.
However, the trend is found to be reversed in the transverse direction. In the
longitudinal direction, we derived an excess overdensity profile showing an
excess up to $r\leq 5$ Mpc after correcting for the quasar's ionization, taking
into account the effect of low spectral resolution. This excess overdensity
profile matches with the average overdensity profile in the transverse
direction without applying any correction for the effect of the quasar's
ionization. Among various possible interpretations, we found that the
anisotropic obscuration of the quasar's ionization seems to be the most
probable explanation. This is also supported by the fact that all of our

nodes subject to a moderate concentration of disorder. Previous analysis
indicates the presence of a quantum phase transition below which disorder

spectral density is preserved in this system. This statement appears to be at
variance with the inevitable presence of statistically rare fluctuations which
cannot be considered as weak and must have strong influence on the system's
spectrum, no matter how small the average concentration. We here reconcile the
two pictures by demonstrating that rare fluctuation potentials in the Weyl
system generate a peculiar type of resonances which carry spectral density in
any neighborhood of zero energy, but never at zero. In this way, the vanishing
of the DoS for weak disorder survives the inclusion of rare events. We
demonstrate this feature by considering three different models of disorder,
each emphasizing specific aspects of the problem: a simplistic box potential
model, a model with Gaussian distributed disorder, and one with a finite number
of $s$-wave scatterers. Our analysis also explains why the protection of the
nodal DoS may be difficult to see in simulations of finite size lattices.

for solving stochastic non-convex optimization problems, in particular it has
been observed to outperform overdamped Langevin Monte Carlo-based methods such
as stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) in many applications. Although
asymptotic global convergence properties of SGHMC are well known, its
finite-time performance is not well-understood. In this work, we study two
variants of SGHMC based on two alternative discretizations of the underdamped
Langevin diffusion. We provide finite-time performance bounds for the global
convergence of both SGHMC variants for solving stochastic non-convex
optimization problems with explicit constants. Our results lead to
non-asymptotic guarantees for both population and empirical risk minimization
problems. For a fixed target accuracy level, on a class of non-convex problems,

X-rays (HXRs) come predominantly from the corona rather than from the more
usual chromospheric footpoints. All of the 26 previously analyzed event time
intervals, over 13 flares, are re-examined for consistency with a flare model
in which electrons are accelerated near the top of a magnetic loop that has a
sufficiently high density to stop most of the electrons by Coulomb collisions
before they can reach the footpoints. Of particular importance in the previous
analysis was the finding that the length of the coronal HXR source increased
with energy in the 20 - 30 keV range. However, after allowing for the
possibility that footpoint emission at the higher energies affects the inferred
length of the coronal HXR source, and using analysis techniques that suppress
the possible influence of such footpoint emission, we conclude that there is no
longer evidence that the length of the HXR coronal sources increase with
increasing energy. In fact, for the 6 flares and 12 time intervals that
satisfied our selection criteria, the loop lengths decreased on average by 1.0
+/- 0.2 arcsec between 20 and 30 keV, with a standard deviation of 3.5 arcsec.
We find strong evidence that the peak of the coronal HXR source increases in
altitude with increasing energy. For the thermal component of the emission,
this is consistent with the standard CHSKP flare model in which magnetic
reconnection in a coronal current sheet results in new hot loops being formed
at progressively higher altitudes. The explanation for the nonthermal emission
is not so clear.

5-moment model includes Hall stabilization whereas the 10-moment model includes

different electron mass to understand the role of electron inertia in the
late-time nonlinear evolution of the MRT instability. For the 5-moment model,
the late-time nonlinear MRT evolution does not significantly depend on the
electron inertia. However, when FLR stabilization is important, the 10-moment
results show that a lower ion-to-electron mass ratio (i.e. larger electron
inertia) under-predicts the energy in high-wavenumber modes due to larger FLR
stabilization.

unique to nonlinear dynamic systems of high-dimensional phase space. They
enable understanding of a wide range of cyclic processes in natural, social and
engineering systems. Here we show that limit cycles form in coupled polariton
cavities following the breaking of Josephson coupling, leading to
frequency-comb emission. The limit cycles and destruction of Josephson coupling
both appear due to interplay between strong polariton-polariton interaction and
a dissipative contribution to the cavity coupling. The resulting nonlinear
dynamics of the condensates is characterized by asymmetric population
distribution and nontrivial average phase difference between the two
condensates, and by time-periodic modulation of their amplitudes and phases.
The latter is manifested by coherent emission of new equidistant frequency
components. The emission spectrum resembles that of a micro-frequency comb, but
originates from a fundamentally different mechanism than that of existing
frequency combs. It allows non-resonant excitation with a power input much
below the conventional semiconductor laser threshold. The comb line spacing is
determined by the interaction and coupling strengths, and is adjustable up to
multi-terahertz frequency. The work establishes coupled polariton cavities as
an experimental platform for rich nonlinear dynamic phenomena.

determination technique is proposed for matching image pairs that are
significantly disparate in nature. Images in the real world often exhibit high
degrees of variation in scale, orientation, viewpoint, illumination and affine
projection parameters, and are often accompanied by the presence of textureless
regions and complete or partial occlusion of scene objects. The above
conditions confound most correspondence determination techniques by rendering
impractical the use of global contour-based descriptors or local pixel-level
features for establishing correspondence. The proposed deep spectral
correspondence (DSC) determination scheme harnesses the representational power
of local feature descriptors to derive a complex high-level global shape
representation for matching disparate images. The proposed scheme reasons about
correspondence between disparate images using high-level global shape cues
derived from low-level local feature descriptors. Consequently, the proposed
scheme enjoys the best of both worlds, i.e., a high degree of invariance to
affine parameters such as scale, orientation, viewpoint, illumination afforded
by the global shape cues and robustness to occlusion provided by the low-level
feature descriptors. While the shape-based component within the proposed scheme
infers what to look for, an additional saliency-based component dictates where
to look at thereby tackling the noisy correspondences arising from the presence
of textureless regions and complex backgrounds. In the proposed scheme, a joint
image graph is constructed using distances computed between interest points in
the appearance (i.e., image) space. Eigenspectral decomposition of the joint
image graph allows for reasoning about shape similarity to be performed
jointly, in the appearance space and eigenspace.

the purpose of making explicit the feedback loop between the evolution of the
user's opinion and the personalised recommendation of contents. More
specifically, we assume that the user is endowed with a scalar opinion about a
certain issue and seeks news about it on a news aggregator: this opinion is
influenced by all received news, which are characterized by a binary position
on the issue at hand. The user is affected by a confirmation bias, that is, a
preference for news that confirm her current opinion. The news aggregator
recommends items with the goal of maximizing the number of user's clicks (as a
measure of her engagement): in order to fulfil its goal, the recommender has to
compromise between exploring the user's preferences and exploiting what it has
learned so far. After defining suitable metrics for the effectiveness of the
recommender systems (such as the click-through rate) and for its impact on the

analysis of the model. We find that personalised recommendations markedly
affect the evolution of opinions and favor the emergence of more extreme ones:
the intensity of these effects is inherently related to the effectiveness of

Feynman diagram technique and his variational approach. The former provides a
powerful tool to construct a systematic expansion for a generic interacting
system, while the latter allows optimization of a perturbation theory using a
variational principle. Here we show that combining a variational approach with
a new diagrammatic quantum Monte Carlo method, both based on the Feynman's
original ideas, results in a powerful and accurate solver to the generic solid
state problem, in which a macroscopic number of electrons interact by the long
range Coulomb repulsion. We apply the solver to the quintessential problem of
solid state, the uniform electron gas (UEG), which is at the heart of the
density functional theory (DFT) success in describing real materials, yet it
has not been adequately solved for over 90 years. While some wave-function
properties, like the ground state energy, have been very accurately calculated
by the diffusion Monte Carlo method (DMC), the static and dynamic response
functions, which are directly accessed by the experiment, and are crucial for
development of non-local and non-adiabatic density functionals, remain poorly
understood. Our method allows us to calculate the momentum-frequency resolved
spin response functions for the first time, and to improve on the precision of
the charge response function. The accuracy of both response functions is
sufficiently high, so as to uncover previously missed fine structure in these
responses. This method can be straightforwardly applied to a large number of
moderately interacting electron systems in the thermodynamic limit, including
realistic models of metallic and semiconducting solids.

showed that this type of rotation cannot be obtained in the tidal stirring

tidal forces of the host galaxy. However, we successfully reproduced the
observed Andromeda II kinematics in controlled, self-consistent simulations of
mergers between equal-mass disky dwarf galaxies on a radial or close-to-radial

where the model itself becomes a complex system. One of the important aspects

situation where a system being modeled, or modeling requirements change over

automatic building and management of complex models we propose a general
evolutionary computation approach which enables managing of complexity and

compared to other methods of late-stage giant planet formation. As has been
pointed out before, gas accreting into a gap and onto the planet will encounter
the planetary dynamo-generated magnetic field. The planetary magnetic field
produces an effective cross section through which gas is accreted. Gas outside
this cross section is recycled into the protoplanetary disk, hence only a
fraction of mass that is accreted into the gap remains bound to the planet.
This cross section inversely scales with the planetary mass, which naturally
leads to stalled planetary growth late in the formation process. We show that
this method naturally leads to Jupiter-mass planets and does not invoke any
artificial truncation of gas accretion, as has been done in some previous
population synthesis models. The mass accretion rate depends on the radius of
the growing planet after the gap has opened, and we show that so-called
hot-start planets tend to become more massive than cold-start planets. When
this result is combined with population synthesis models, it might show
observable signatures of cold-start versus hot-start planets in the exoplanet
population.

signatures will require a robust understanding of its distribution in the sky

  The first part of this thesis describes the implementation of a novel

electromagnetic environment is generally well-described by an effective
multimode Kerr Hamiltonian at sufficiently weak excitation. This Hamiltonian
can be embedded in a master equation with losses determined by the details of
the electromagnetic environment. Recent experiments indicate, however, that
when a superconducting circuit is driven with microwave signals the observed
relaxation rates appear to be substantially different from expectations based
on the electromagnetic environment of the qubit alone. This issue is a limiting
factor in the optimization of superconducting qubit readout schemes. We claim
here that an effective master equation with drive-power dependent parameters is
an efficient approach to model such quantum dynamics. In this sequence of
papers, we derive effective master equations, whose parameters exhibit
nonlinear dependence on the excitation level of the circuit as well as the
electromagnetic environment of the qubit. We show that the number
non-conserving terms in the qubit nonlinearity generally lead to a
renormalization of dissipative parameters of the effective master equation,
while the number conserving terms give rise to a renormalization of the system
frequencies. Here, in Part I, we consider the excitation-relaxation dynamics of
a transmon qubit that is prepared in a certain initial state, but is not driven
otherwise. A unitary transformation technique is introduced to study the
renormalization of i) qubit relaxation due to coupling to a generic bath and
ii) Purcell decay. Analytic expressions are provided for the dependence of the
nonlinear dissipative terms on the details of the electromagnetic environment
of the qubit. The perturbation technique based on unitary transformations
developed here is generalized to the continuously driven case in Part II.

this issue via asynchronous updates. We formulate, develop and implement a

argue how both these schemes naturally trade-off between old and new data. We
then theoretically and empirically show that these two seemingly different

fraudulent activities. However, there is usually a gap between the time that a
user commits a fraudulent action and the time that the user is suspended by the
platform. How to detect fraudsters in time is a challenging problem. Most of
the existing approaches adopt classifiers to predict fraudsters given their
activity sequences along time. The main drawback of classification models is
that the prediction results between consecutive timestamps are often
inconsistent. In this paper, we propose a survival analysis based fraud early
detection model, SAFE, which maps dynamic user activities to survival
probabilities that are guaranteed to be monotonically decreasing along time.
SAFE adopts recurrent neural network (RNN) to handle user activity sequences
and directly outputs hazard values at each timestamp, and then, survival
probability derived from hazard values is deployed to achieve consistent
predictions. Because we only observe the user suspended time instead of the
fraudulent activity time in the training data, we revise the loss function of
the regular survival model to achieve fraud early detection. Experimental
results on two real world datasets demonstrate that SAFE outperforms both the
survival analysis model and recurrent neural network model alone as well as
state-of-the-art fraud early detection approaches.

equilibrium by an electric double layer consisting of a layer of electric
charge on the surface that is screened by a diffuse ion cloud in the bulk
fluid. This screening cloud determines not only the interactions between
charged colloidal particles or polyelectrolytes and their self-assembly into
ordered structures, but it is also pivotal in understanding energy storage
devices, such as electrochemical cells and supercapacitors. However, little is
known to what spatial complexity the electric double layers can be designed.
Here, we show that electric double layers of non-trivial topology and geometry
-including tori, multi-tori and knots- can be realised in charged topological
colloidal particles, using numerical modelling within a mean-field
Poisson-Boltzmann theory. We show that the complexity of double layers
-including geometry and topology- can be tuned by changing the Debye screening
length of the medium, or by changing the shape and topology of the (colloidal)
particle. More generally, this work is an attempt to introduce concepts of
topology in the field of charged colloids, which could lead to novel exciting
material design paradigms.

disordered spin systems. From the perspective of entanglement monogamy, the two

recent work, the concurrence of subsystems, a measure of local entanglement,
was used in a study of many-body localization in a one-dimensional spin-$1/2$
system (Bera and Lakshminarayan, 2016). We show numerically that the negativity
displays notably similar behavior for this system, with the advantage that it
can also be extended to systems of higher local dimension. We then demonstrate
this extension in practice by using it to predict the existence of an MBL phase
in a disordered a spin-1 system. In terms of global entanglement, the geometric
entanglement of both spin-$1/2$ and spin-1 systems is also shown to behave as a
complementary indicator of the MBL phenomenon.

using a simulation from the Euclid Flagship campaign and demonstrated to have
converged up to wavenumbers $k\approx 5\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ for redshifts

software UQLab and it has been optimized first by creating mock emulators based
on Takahashi's HALOFIT. We show that it is possible to successfully predict the
performance of the final emulator in this way prior to performing any N-body
simulations. We provide a C-code to calculate the nonlinear correction at a
relative accuracy of $\sim0.3\%$ with respect to N-body simulations within 50
ms. The absolute accuracy of the final nonlinear power spectrum is comparable
to one obtained with N-body simulations, i.e. $\sim 1\%$ for $k\lesssim

modeling in the nonlinear regime allowing for maximum likelihood estimation of
cosmological parameters. EuclidEmulator has been compared to HALOFIT and
CosmicEmu, an alternative emulator based on the Mira-Titan Universe, and shown
to be more accurate than these other approaches. This work paves a new way for
optimal construction of future emulators that also consider other cosmological

goal in computer graphics. On the other hand, recent developments in deep
neural networks allow for trainable models that can produce natural-looking
images with little or no knowledge about the scene structure. While the
generated images often consist of realistic looking local patterns, the overall
structure of the generated images is often inconsistent. In this work we
propose a trainable, geometry-aware image generation method that leverages
various types of scene information, including geometry and segmentation, to
create realistic looking natural images that match the desired scene structure.
Our geometrically-consistent image synthesis method is a deep neural network,
called Geometry to Image Synthesis (GIS) framework, which retains the
advantages of a trainable method, e.g., differentiability and adaptiveness,
but, at the same time, makes a step towards the generalizability, control and
quality output of modern graphics rendering engines. We utilize the GIS
framework to insert vehicles in outdoor driving scenes, as well as to generate
novel views of objects from the Linemod dataset. We qualitatively show that our
network is able to generalize beyond the training set to novel scene
geometries, object shapes and segmentations. Furthermore, we quantitatively
show that the GIS framework can be used to synthesize large amounts of training
data which proves beneficial for training instance segmentation models.

comprehension of relativity between two datasets. Metadata can be enriched to
calculate the existence of a connection between different disintegrated
datasets. In order to do so, the very first task is to attain a generic
metadata representation for domains. This representation narrows down the
metadata search space. The metadata search space consists of attributes, tags,
semantic content, annotations etc. to perform classification. The existing
technologies limit the metadata bandwidth i.e. the operation set for matching
purposes is restricted or limited. This research focuses on generating a mapper
function called cognate that can find mathematical relevance based on pairs of
attributes between disintegrated datasets. Each pair is designed from one of
the datasets under consideration using the existing metadata and available
meta-tags. After pairs have been generated, samples are constructed using a
different combination of pairs. The similarity and relevance between two or
more pairs are attained by using a data clustering technique to generate large
groups from smaller groups based on similarity index. The search space is
divided using a domain divider function and smaller search spaces are created
using relativity and tagging as the main concept. For this research, the
initial datasets have been limited to textual information. Once all disjoint
meta-collection have been generated the approximation algorithm calculates the
centers of each meta-set. These centers serve the purpose of meta-pointers i.e.
a collection of meta-domain representations. Each pointer can then join a
cluster based on the content i.e. meta-content. It also facilitates the process
of possible synonyms across cross-functional domains. This can be examined
using meta-pointers and graph pools.

A famous conjecture due to Akiyama, Exoo, and Harary from 1980 asserts that

coupled to a single base station (BS). However, for heterogeneous networks, a
new architectural paradigm whereby UL and DL are not associated with the same

improved UL performance. Motivated by such gains, and by using typical results
from stochastic geometry, we formulate the offloading latency for the MEC-based

performance to the conventional coupled access scheme. Despite the backhaul

  Tasks involving Complex Dynamics","7 pages",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning robot tasks or controllers using deep reinforcement learning has
been proven effective in simulations. Learning in simulation has several
advantages. For example, one can fully control the simulated environment,
including halting motions while performing computations. Another advantage when
robots are involved, is that the amount of time a robot is occupied learning a
task---rather than being productive---can be reduced by transferring the
learned task to the real robot. Transfer learning requires some amount of
fine-tuning on the real robot. For tasks which involve complex (non-linear)
dynamics, the fine-tuning itself may take a substantial amount of time. In
order to reduce the amount of fine-tuning we propose to learn robustified
controllers in simulation. Robustified controllers are learned by exploiting
the ability to change simulation parameters (both appearance and dynamics) for
successive training episodes. An additional benefit for this approach is that
it alleviates the precise determination of physics parameters for the
simulator, which is a non-trivial task. We demonstrate our proposed approach on
a real setup in which a robot aims to solve a maze game, which involves complex
dynamics due to static friction and potentially large accelerations. We show
that the amount of fine-tuning in transfer learning for a robustified
controller is substantially reduced compared to a non-robustified controller.

Here, the relation between the uncertainty limited statistics of joint
measurements and the limits on expectation values of possible input states is
analyzed. It is shown that the experimentally observable statistics of joint
measurements explain the uncertainty limits of local states, but result in less
restrictive bounds when applied to identify the limits of non-local
correlations between two separate quantum systems. A tight upper bound is
obtained for the four correlations that appear in the violation of Bell's
inequalities and the statistics of pure states saturating the bound is
characterized. The results indicate that the limitations of quantum
non-locality are a necessary consequence of the local features of joint

explained in terms of the local characteristics of quantum statistics.

singlet-quintet mixing. (1) The zero-temperature spin susceptibility remains
zero for the singlet-quintet mixed state if only the centrosymmetric spin-orbit

non-centrosymmetric spin-orbit coupling is introduced. (2) The singlet-quintet
mixing can help enhance the upper critical field roughly because it can
increase $T_c$. (3) Although the quintet channel is generally suppressed by the
non-magnetic disorder scattering, we find the strong mixing between singlet and

still find a sizable quintet component mixed into the singlet channel in the

promises to reduce these observational discrepancies at galactic scales. The
model, known as Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM), avoids cusps, suppresses small-scale
power, and delays galaxy formation via macroscopic quantum pressure. We compare
the substructure and density fluctuations of galactic dark matter haloes
comprised of ultra-light axions to conventional CDM results. Besides
self-gravitating subhaloes, FDM includes non-virialized over-dense wavelets
formed by quantum interference patterns which are an efficient source of
heating to galactic discs. We find that, in the solar neighborhood, wavelet
heating is sufficient to give the oldest disc stars a velocity dispersion of
$\sim 30 \: \mathrm{km} \: \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ within a Hubble time if energy is
not lost from the disc, the velocity dispersion increasing with stellar age as
$\sigma_D \propto t^{0.4}$ in agreement with observations. Furthermore, we
calculate the radius-dependent velocity dispersion and corresponding scale
height caused by the heating of this dynamical substructure in both CDM and FDM

terminates the Milky Way disc at $15 - 20 \: \mathrm{kpc}$. Although the source

dark substructure cannot exceed the total disc velocity dispersion. Therefore,
this work provides a lower bound on the FDM particle mass of $m_a > 0.6 \times

framework, every active device partitions its data into several sub-blocks and,
subsequently, adds redundancy using a systematic linear block code. Compressed
sensing techniques are then employed to recover sub-blocks up to a permutation
of their order, and the original messages are obtained by stitching fragments
together using a tree-based algorithm. The error probability and computational
complexity of this access paradigm are characterized. An optimization
framework, which exploits the tradeoff between performance and computational
complexity, is developed to assign parity-check bits to each sub-block. In
addition, two emblematic parity bit allocation strategies are examined and
their performances are analyzed in the limit as the number of active users and
their corresponding payloads tend to infinity. The number of channel uses
needed and the computational complexity associated with these allocation
strategies are established for various scaling regimes. Numerical results
demonstrate that coded compressed sensing outperforms other existing practical

Dynamics simulations, we show that an exponentially mass-graded junction with a
finite thickness can result in 68\% of enhancement in thermal conductance
larger compared to a single bridging layer (29\%) and a linear mass-graded
junction (64\%) of similar thickness. We examine how the thermal conductance at
such interfaces is influenced by geometric qualities and strength of
anharmonicity. For geometric properties, we tested the effects from number of
layers and the junction thickness. In the absence of anharmonicity, increasing
the number of layers results in better elastic phonon transmission at each
individual boundary, countered by the decrease of available conducting
channels. Consequently, in the harmonic regime, conductance initially increases
with number of layers due to better bridging, but quickly saturates. The
presence of slight anharmonic effects (at ultra-low temperature T = 2 K) turns
the saturation into a monotonically increasing trend. Anharmonic effects can
facilitate interfacial thermal transport through the thermalization of phonons.
At high temperature, however, the role of anharmonicity as a facilitator of
interfacial thermal transport reverses. Strong anharmonicity introduces
significant intrinsic resistance, overruling the enhancement in thermal
conduction at the boundaries. Our analysis shows that in our model
Lennard-Jones system, the influence of a mass-graded junction on thermal
conductance is dominated by the phonon thermalization through anharmonic
effects, while elastic phonon transmission plays a secondary role.

crucial condition for thermal energy harvesting materials. Nanostructuring
offers a very powerful tool to address both requirements: in nanostructured
materials, boundaries preferentially scatter phonons compared to electrons. The
search for low-thermal-conductivity nanostructures is typically limited to
materials with simple crystal structures, such as silicon, because of the
complexity arising from modeling branch- and wave vector- dependent nanoscale
heat transport. Using the phonon mean-free-path (MFP) dependent Boltzmann
transport equation, a model that overcomes this limitation, we compute thermal
transport in 75 nanoporous half-Heusler compounds for different pore sizes. We
demonstrate that the optimization of thermal transport in nanostructures should
take into account both bulk thermal properties and geometry-dependent phonon
suppression, two aspects that are typically engineered separately. In fact, our
work predicts that, given a set of bulk materials and a system geometry, the
ordering of the thermal conductivity of the nanostructure does not necessarily
align with that of the bulk: We show that what dictates thermal transport is
the interplay between the bulk MFP distribution and the nanostructuring length
scale of the material. Finally, we derive a thermal transport model that
enables fast systems screening within large bulk material repositories and a
given geometry. Our study motivates the need for a holistic approach to
engineering thermal transport and provides a method for high-throughput
materials discovery.

the microwave range. Its optically-thin, high-frequency component, above the
spectral peak, is often used for diagnostics of the nonthermal electrons and
the magnetic field in the radio source. Under favorable conditions, its
low-frequency counterpart brings additional, complementary information about
these parameters as well as thermal plasma diagnostics, either through
gyrosynchrotron self-absorption, free-free absorption by the thermal plasma, or
the suppression of emission through the so-called Razin effect. However, their
effects on the low-frequency spectrum are often masked by spatial
nonuniformity. To disentangle the various contributions to low-frequency
gyrosynchrotron emission, a combination of spectral and imaging data is needed.
To this end, we have investigated Owens Valley Solar Array (OVSA)
multi-frequency images for 26 solar bursts observed jointly with Reuven Ramaty
High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) during the first half of 2002.
For each, we examined dynamic spectra, time- and frequency-synthesis maps,
RHESSI images with overlaid OVSA contours, and a few representative
single-frequency snapshot OVSA images. We focus on the frequency dependence of
microwave source sizes derived from the OVSA images and their effect on the
low-frequency microwave spectral slope. We succeed in categorizing 18 analyzed
events into several groups. Four events demonstrate clear evidence of being
dominated by gyrosynchrotron self-absorption, with an inferred brightness
temperature of $\geq10^8$~K. The low-frequency spectra in the remaining events
are affected to varying degree by Razin suppression. We find that many radio
sources are rather large at low frequencies, which can have important
implications for solar energetic particle production and escape.

Conventional detection techniques are unable to deal with the increasingly

sensors and actuators generate large amounts of data streams that can be
continuously monitored for intrusion events. Unsupervised machine learning
techniques can be used to model the system behaviour and classify deviant

conditions of a CPS. Instead of treating each sensor's and actuator's time
series independently, we model the time series of multiple sensors and
actuators in the CPS concurrently to take into account of potential latent
interactions between them. To exploit both the generator and the discriminator
of our GAN, we deployed the GAN-trained discriminator together with the
residuals between generator-reconstructed data and the actual samples to detect
possible anomalies in the complex CPS. We used our GAN-AD to distinguish
abnormal attacked situations from normal working conditions for a complex
six-stage Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) system. Experimental results showed
that the proposed strategy is effective in identifying anomalies caused by

present a Deep Learning (DL) framework for passive synthetic aperture radar

which are either spatially separated or colocated with sufficient directivity
to estimate the underlying waveform prior to imaging. Our approach to passive
radar only requires a single receiver, hence reduces cost and increases
versatility. We approach DL from an optimization perspective and formulate
image reconstruction as a machine learning task. By unfolding the iterations of
a proximal gradient descent algorithm, we construct a deep recurrent neural
network (RNN) that is parameterized by transmitted waveforms. We cascade the
RNN structure with a decoder stage to form a recurrent-auto encoder
architecture. We then utilize backpropagation to learn transmitted waveforms by
training the network in an unsupervised manner using SAR measurements. The
highly non-convex problem of backpropagation is guided to a feasible solution
over the parameter space by initializing the network with the known components
of the SAR forward model. Moreover, prior information regarding the waveform
structure is incorporated during initialization and backpropagation. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the DL-based approach through extensive

fabricate a two-terminal device based on the conductive two-dimensional hole

the speed of light meaning they will arrive at a remote location significantly
earlier than the fastest seismic waves. If these gravitational signals are
measured by a gravimeter then early warning can be provided for an imminent
earthquake. Earlier detection of earthquakes could be used to protect crucial
infrastructure and save lives. The Torsion Pendulum Dual Oscillator (TorPeDO)
is a gravity gradient sensor that has been constructed at the Australian
National University. In this article we investigate the feasibility of
measuring prompt gravitational transients from earthquakes with the TorPeDO. We
simulated the response of the sensor to these signals and inserted these
responses into scaled TorPeDO strain data to test their detection using a
matched filter search. This simulation allows us to estimate the
signal-to-noise ratio and detection time of the sensor to these transient
signals, along with the influence of different detection thresholds on range
and detection time. This article also proposes a method of earthquake
localisation using TorPeDO sensors without the need for accurate signal timing.
A real-time estimate of earthquake magnitude can be produced by combining this
calculated location with TorPeDO strain data. We find that a TorPeDO system
operating at design sensitivity would measure a moment magnitude 7.1

serve as an efficient trigger of powerful starbursts. However, observational
studies of the molecular gas properties during their early stages are scarce.
We present interferometric CO(2-1) maps of two luminous infrared galaxies
(LIRGs), NGC 3110 and NGC 232, obtained with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) with
~ 1 kpc resolution. While NGC 3110 is a spiral galaxy interacting with a minor
(14:1 stellar mass) companion, NGC 232 is interacting with a similarly sized
object. We find that such interactions have likely induced in these galaxies
enhancements in the molecular gas content and central concentrations, partly at
the expense of atomic gas. The obtained molecular gas surface densities in
their circumnuclear regions are $\Sigma_{\rm mol}~\gtrsim10^{2.5}$ M$_\odot$
pc$^{-2}$, higher than in non-interacting objects by an order of magnitude. Gas
depletion times of ~ 0.5 - 1 Gyr are found for the different regions, lying in
between non-interacting disk galaxies and the starburst sequence. In the case
of NGC 3110, the spiral arms show on average 0.5 dex shorter depletion times
than in the circumnuclear regions if we assume a similar H$_2$-CO conversion
factor. We show that even in the early stages of the interaction with a minor
companion, a starburst is formed along the circumnuclear region and spiral
arms, where a large population of SSCs is found (~350), and at the same time a
large central gas concentration is building up which might be the fuel for an
active galactic nucleus. The main morphological properties of the NGC 3110
system are reproduced by our numerical simulations and allow us to estimate
that the current epoch of the interaction is at ~ 150 Myrs after closest
approach.

constant accelerations induced by a distant third body and Gaussian
accelerations that resemble a kick profile. We find mismatches below

an implicit strong assumption; it is assumed that the weights of all the edges

present a detailed analysis of the Star Formation Rate (SFR)-stellar mass
(M_star) and specific SFR(SSFR)-M_star relations as a function of environment.
We adopt three different parameterizations of environment, to probe different
scales. We consider separately 1) galaxies in groups, binary and single
systems, defined in terms of a Friends-of-Friends algorithm, 2) galaxies
located at different projected local densities, 3) galaxies in haloes of
different mass. Overall, above logM_ast/M_sun>10.25 and SSFR>10^{-12} yr^{-1},
the SFR-M_ast and SSFR-M_ast relations do not depend on environment, when the
global environment is used, while when the halo mass is considered, high mass
haloes might have a systematically lower (S)SFR-M_ast relation. Finally, when
local densities are exploited, at any given mass galaxies in less dense
environments have systematically higher values of SFR. All the relations are
characterized by a large scatter ({\sigma}~0.6), which is dueto the coexistence
of galaxies of different morphological types. Indeed, at any given mass,
late-types are characterized by systematically higher values of SFR and SSFR
than S0s and ellipticals. Galaxies of the same morphology show similar trends
in all the environments, but their incidence strongly depends on environment
and on the environmental parametrization adopted, with late-types generally
becoming less common in denser environments, contrasted by the increase of
ellipticals and/or S0s. Our results suggest that in the local universe
morphology and local interactions, probed by the local density
parameterization, have dominant roles in driving the characteristics of the
SFR-M_ast relation.

the beta family and its three- and four-parameter ramifications that allow for

in the Navier-Stokes equations is negligibly small and the resulting velocity
field obeys Gaussian statistics. Nonlinear effects become important as the
driving becomes stronger and a transition occurs to turbulence with anomalous
scaling of velocity increments and derivatives. This process has been described
by V. Yakhot and D. A. Donzis, Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 044501 (2017) for
homogeneous and isotropic turbulence (HIT). In more realistic flows driven by
complex physical phenomena, such as instabilities and nonlocal forces, the
initial state itself, and the transition to turbulence from that initial state,
are much more complex. In this paper, we discuss the Reynolds-number-dependence
of moments of the kinetic energy dissipation rate of orders 2 and 3 obtained in
the bulk of thermal convection in the Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard system. The data are
obtained from three-dimensional spectral element direct numerical simulations

$\ell$ and the corresponding root-mean-square velocity are obtained by varying
the Prandtl number Pr from 0.005 to 100 at a fixed Rayleigh number ${\rm
Ra}=10^5$. A few specific features of the data agree with the theory but the
normalized moments of the kinetic energy dissipation rate, ${\cal E}_n$, show a
non-monotonic dependence for small Reynolds numbers before obeying the
algebraic scaling prediction for the turbulent state. Implications and reasons

clustering, typically require careful data transformations to be effective:
upon observing a matrix $A$, one may look at the spectrum of $\psi(A)$ for a
properly chosen $\psi$. The issue is that the spectrum of $A$ might be
contaminated by non-informational top eigenvalues, e.g., due to scale`
variations in the data, and the application of $\psi$ aims to remove these.
  Designing a good functional $\psi$ (and establishing what good means) is
often challenging and model dependent. This paper proposes a simple and generic
construction for sparse graphs, $$\psi(A) = \1((I+A)^r \ge1),$$ where $A$
denotes the adjacency matrix and $r$ is an integer (less than the graph
diameter). This produces a graph connecting vertices from the original graph
that are within distance $r$, and is referred to as graph powering. It is shown
that graph powering regularizes the graph and decontaminates its spectrum in
the following sense: (i) If the graph is drawn from the sparse
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi ensemble, which has no spectral gap, it is shown that graph
powering produces a `maximal' spectral gap, with the latter justified by
establishing an Alon-Boppana result for powered graphs; (ii) If the graph is
drawn from the sparse SBM, graph powering is shown to achieve the fundamental
limit for weak recovery (the KS threshold) similarly to \cite{massoulie-STOC},
settling an open problem therein. Further, graph powering is shown to be
significantly more robust to tangles and cliques than previous spectral
algorithms based on self-avoiding or nonbacktracking walk counts
\cite{massoulie-STOC,Mossel_SBM2,bordenave,colin3}. This is illustrated on a
geometric block model that is dense in cliques.

propose a method that covers both model averaging and model selection in the

constraint-based learning---sensitivity to errors in the independence
tests---by a novel way of combining bootstrap with constraint-based learning.
Essentially, we provide an algorithm for learning a tree, in which each node
represents a scored CPDAG for a subset of variables and the level of the node
corresponds to the maximal order of conditional independencies that are encoded
in the graph. As higher order independencies are tested in deeper recursive
calls, they benefit from more bootstrap samples, and therefore more resistant
to the curse-of-dimensionality. Moreover, the re-use of stable low order
independencies allows greater computational efficiency. We also provide an

solutions exist that lead to so-called dispersive velocity components and
dispersive stresses. They play a significant role in the mean-flow momentum
balance near the wall, but typically disappear in the outer layer. A
theoretical framework is presented to study the decay of dispersive motions in
the outer layer. To this end, the problem is formulated in Fourier space, and a
set of governing ordinary differential equations per mode in wavenumber space
is derived by linearizing the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations around
a constant background velocity. With further simplifications, analytically
tractable solutions are found consisting of linear combinations of $\exp(-kz)$
and $\exp(-Kz)$, with $z$ the wall distance, $k$ the magnitude of the
horizontal wavevector $\mathbf{k}$, and where $K(\mathbf{k},\textit{Re})$ is a
function of $\mathbf{k}$ and the Reynolds number $\textit{Re}$. Moreover, for
$k\rightarrow \infty$ or $k_1\rightarrow 0$, $K\rightarrow k$ is found, in
which case solutions consist of a linear combination of $\exp(-kz)$ and
$z\exp(-kz)$, and are Reynolds number independent. These analytical relations
are verified in the limit of $k_1=0$ using the rough boundary layer experiments

structure for high spectrum efficiency radio vortex wireless communications.
However, the OAM based electromagnetic waves are vortically hollow and
divergent, which may result in the signal loss. Moreover, the divergence of
corresponding OAM based electromagnetic wave increases as the order of OAM-mode
and radius of UCA increases. Therefore, it is difficult to use high-order
OAM-mode, because the corresponding received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is
very small. To overcome the difficulty of high-order OAM modes transmission, in
this paper we propose a lens antenna based electromagnetic waves converging
scheme, which maintains the angular identification of multiple OAM-modes for
radio vortex wireless communications. We further develop a bifocal lens antenna
to not only converge the electromagnetic wave, but also compensate the SNR loss

bifocal lens can converge the OAM waves into cylinder-like beams, providing an
efficient way to increase the spectrum efficiency of wireless communications.

Moreover, the optical propagation between the DM and the Wave-Front Sensor

highly affect the AO performance and thus the scientific observation. They have
to be measured and compensated, for instance by updating the calibration. A new
strategy consists of estimating the mis-registrations and injecting them into
synthetic models to generate noise-free interaction matrices. This
pseudo-synthetic approach is the baseline for the Adaptive Optics Facility
working with a Shack-Hartmann WFS and seems particularly suited for the future
Extremely Large Telescope as the calibration will have to be regularly updated,
for a large numbers of actuators. In this paper, the feasibility of a pseudo

procedure to adjust the mis-registrations parameters is introduced, extracting
them from an experimental interaction matrix. We successfully tested an
interaction matrix generated from the model on the real system in high-order AO
mode. We recorded a slightly better performance with respect to the
experimental one. This work demonstrates that a high accuracy calibration can
be obtained using the pseudo synthetic approach with pyramid WFS.

galactic nucleus (AGN) is required to regulate the growth of its host galaxy
through feedback mechanisms, produced by e.g. AGN-driven outflows. Although
such outflows are common both at low and high redshift, a comprehensive picture
is still missing. The peak epoch of galaxy assembly (1<z<3) has been poorly
explored so far, and current observations in this redshift range are mostly
limited to targets with high chances to be in an outflowing phase. This paper
introduces SUPER (a SINFONI Survey for Unveiling the Physics and Effect of
Radiative feedback), an ongoing ESO's VLT/SINFONI Large Programme. SUPER will
perform the first systematic investigation of ionized outflows in a sizeable
and blindly-selected sample of 39 X-ray AGN at z~2, which reaches high spatial
resolutions (~2 kpc) thanks to the adaptive optics-assisted IFU observations.
The outflow morphology and star formation in the host galaxy will be mapped
through the broad component of [OIII] and the narrow component of Ha emission
lines. The main aim of our survey is to infer the impact of outflows on the
on-going star formation and to link the outflow properties to a number of AGN
and host galaxy properties. We describe here the survey characteristics and
goals, as well as the selection of the target sample. Moreover, we present a
full characterization of its multi-wavelength properties: we measure, via
spectral energy distribution fitting of UV-to-FIR photometry, stellar masses
(4x10^9-2x10^11 Msun), star formation rates (25-680 Msun yr^-1) and AGN
bolometric luminosities (2x10^44-8x10^47 erg s^-1), along with obscuring column
densities (<2x10^24 cm^-2) and 2-10 keV luminosities (2x10^43-6x10^45 erg s^-1)
derived through X-ray spectral analysis. Finally, we classify our AGN as jetted
or non-jetted according to their radio and FIR emission.

dynamic range (LDR) of graphene-based photodetectors, the lack of efficient
generation and extraction of photoexcited charges, the smearing of photoactive
junctions due to hot-carriers effects, large-scale fabrication and ultimately
the environmental stability of the constituent materials. In order to overcome
the aforementioned limits, different approaches to tune the properties of
graphene have been explored. A new class of graphene-based devices has emerged
where chemical functionalisation, hybridisation with light-sensitising
materials and the formation of heterostructures with other 2D materials have
led to improved performance, stability or versatility. For example,
intercalation of graphene with FeCl$_3$ is highly stable in ambient conditions
and can be used to define photo-active junctions characterized by an
unprecedented LDR while graphene oxide (GO) is a very scalable and versatile
material which supports the photodetection from UV to THz frequencies.
Nanoparticles and quantum dots have been used to enhance the absorption of
pristine graphene and to enable high gain thanks to the photogating effect. In
the same way, hybrid detectors made from stacked sequences of graphene and
layered transition-metal dichalcogenides enabled a class of detectors with high
gain and responsivity. In this work we will review the performance and advances
in functionalised graphene and hybrid photodetectors, with particular focus on
the physical mechanisms governing the photoresponse in these materials, their

parallaxes or main-sequence B-type stars having reliable spectroscopic
distances. The solar peculiar motion in the direction of the GC relative to the
local standard of rest (LSR) was estimated to Uo = 10.7+-1.3 km/s. The
variation in the median radial velocity relative to the LSR as a function of
distance from the sun shows a gradual increase from slightly negative values
near the sun to almost 5 km/s at a distance of around 4 kpc. A sinusoidal
function with an amplitude of 3.4+-1.3 km/s and a maximum at 4.0+-0.6 kpc
inside the sun is the best fit to the data. A positive median radial velocity
relative to the LSR around 1.8 kpc, the expected distance to the Sagittarius
arm, can be excluded at a 99% level of confidence. A marginal peak detected at
this distance may be associated with stellar streams in the star-forming
regions, but it is too narrow to be associated with a major arm feature. A
comparison with test-particle simulations in a fixed galactic potential with an
imposed spiral pattern shows the best agreement with a two-armed spiral
potential having the Scutum-Crux arm as the next major inner arm. A relative
radial forcing of ~1.5% and a pattern speed in the range of 20-30 km/s/kpc
yield the best fit. The lack of a positive velocity perturbation in the region
around the Sagittarius arm excludes it from being a major arm. Thus, the main
spiral potential of the Galaxy is two-armed, while the Sagittarius arm is an
inter-arm feature with only a small mass perturbation associated with it.

under-examined physics. The main objective of this work is to provide a deeper
insight into the underlying coupled fluid-solid interactions of a
low-Reynolds-number fluid flow through a shallow deformable microchannel with
ultra-low height-to-width ratios. The fabricated deformable microchannels of
several microns in height and few millimeters in width, whose aspect ratio is
about two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the previous reports, allow
us to investigate the fluid flow characteristics spanning a variety of distinct
regimes from small wall deflections, where the deformable microchannel
resembles its corresponding rigid one, to wall deflections much larger than the
original height, where the height-independent characteristic behavior emerges.
The effects of the microchannel geometry, membrane properties, and pressure
difference across the channel are represented by a lumped variable called
flexibility parameter. Under the same pressure drop across different channels,
any difference in their geometries is reflected into the flexibility parameter
of the channels, which can potentially cause the devices to operate under
distinct regimes of the fluid-solid characteristics. For a fabricated
microchannel with given membrane properties and channel geometry, on the other
hand, a sufficiently large change in the applied pressure difference can alter
the flow-structure behavior from one characteristic regime to another. By
appropriately introducing the flexibility parameter and the dimensionless
volumetric flow rate, a master curve is found for the fluid flow through any
long and shallow deformable microchannel. A criterion is also suggested for
determining whether the coupled or decoupled fluid-solid mechanics should be
considered.

We examine the high-resolution spectra of the CHEERS sample carefully and take
into account various systematic effects in the spectral modelling. We compare
the observed abundance ratios with those in the Galactic stellar populations,
as well as predictions from stellar yields (low- and intermediate-mass stars,
massive stars and degenerate stars). The nitrogen abundance can only be well

tell whether the obtained higher [N/Fe] and [N/O] ratios are biased due to the
small extraction region ($r/r_{500}\lesssim0.05$) that we adopt here. Since
abundances of odd-$Z$ elements are more sensitive to the initial metallicity of

required to better constrain the chemical enrichment in the X-ray halos of

pollen transfer. These include floral adaptations as well as genetic

outcrossing is favorable over a broad range of conditions. Conversely, SI has
repeatedly been lost, often in association with transitions to
self-fertilization (selfing). This transition is favored when the short-term
advantages of selfing outweigh the costs, primarily inbreeding depression. The
transition to selfing is expected to have major effects on population genetic
variation and adaptive potential, as well as on genome evolution. In the
Brassicaceae, many studies on the population genetic, gene regulatory and
genomic effects of selfing have centered on the model plant Arabidopsis
thaliana and the crucifer genus Capsella. The accumulation of population

the transition to selfing occurred. Future studies will take advantage of the
development of population genetics theory on the impact of selfing, especially

recent transitions to selfing, mixed mating populations and/or multiple

dynamical activity pattern that results from these interactions depends on the
strength of synaptic coupling between them. Importantly, the overall dynamics
of a brain region in the absence of external input, so called ongoing brain
activity, has been attributed to the dynamics of such interactions. In our
study, two different network scenarios are considered: a system with one
inhibitory and two excitatory sub-networks, and a network representation with
three inhibitory sub-networks. To study the effect of synaptic strength on the
global dynamics of the network, two parameters for relative couplings between
these sub-networks are considered. For each case, a co-dimension two
bifurcation analysis is performed and the results have been compared to
large-scale network simulations. Our analysis shows that Generalized
Lotka-Volterra (GLV) equations, well-known in predator-prey studies, yield a
meaningful population-level description for the collective behavior of spiking
neuronal interaction, which have a hierarchical structure. In particular, we
observed a striking equivalence between the bifurcation diagrams of spiking
neuronal networks and their corresponding GLV equations. This study gives new
insight on the behavior of neuronal assemblies, and can potentially suggest new
mechanisms for altering the dynamical patterns of spiking networks based on
changing the synaptic strength between some groups of neurons.

first systematic study of variability in a large sample of candidate MYSOs.We
examined the data for variability of the putative driving sources of all known
Spitzer EGOs and bright 24 \mu m sources coinciding with the peak of 870 \mu m
detected ATLASGAL clumps, a total of 718 targets. Of these, 190 point sources
(139 EGOs and 51 non-EGOs) displayed variability (IQR > 0.05, \Delta Ks > 0.15
mag). Light-curves(LCs) have been sub-classified into eruptive, dipper, fader,
short-term-variable and long-period variable-YSO categories.Lomb-Scargle
periodogram analysis of periodic LCs was carried out. 1 - 870 \mu m spectral
energy distributions of the variable sources were fitted with YSO models to
obtain representative properties. 41% of the variable sources are represented
by > 4Msun objects, and only 6% by > 8Msun objects.The highest-mass objects are
mostly non-EGOs,deeply embedded.By placing them on the HR diagram we show that
most lower mass,EGO type objects are concentrated on the putative birth-line
position, while the luminous non-EGO type objects group around the ZAMS
track.Some of the most luminous far infrared sources in the massive clumps and
infrared quiet driving sources of EGOs have been missed out by this study owing
to an uniform sample selection method.A high rate of detectable variability in
EGO targets (139 out of 153 searched) implies that near-infrared variability in
MYSOs is closely linked to the accretion phenomenon and outflow activity.

decoration-iteration transformation. The phase diagram, spontaneous
magnetization and electric polarization are exactly calculated and their
dependencies are comprehensively investigated under a concurrent influence of
temperature and electric field. It is found that the electric field mostly
stabilizes at zero temperature the spontaneous antiferromagnetic order with
respect to the ferromagnetic one. At finite temperatures the external electric
field gradually suppresses a spontaneous ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic)
order emergent close to a quarter (half) filling. An enhanced magnetoelectric
response is detectable in vicinity of a continuous phase transition at which
the spontaneous magnetization vanishes and the electric polarization displays a
weak-type singularity. It is demonstrated that reentrant phase transitions of
the ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic phase may be induced at moderate values
of the electric field, which simultaneously produces a sharp kink in a critical
line of the ferromagnetic phase nearby a quarter filling.

Neural Networks have recently been proposed to overcome this limitation by
learning to estimate object occupancy. These estimates are nevertheless subject
to uncertainty, making the evaluation of their confidence an important issue
for these measures to be useful for autonomous navigation and mapping. In this
work we approach the problem from two sides. First we discuss uncertainty
estimation in deep models, proposing a solution based on a fully convolutional
neural network. The proposed architecture is not restricted by the assumption
that the uncertainty follows a Gaussian model, as in the case of many popular
solutions for deep model uncertainty estimation, such as Monte-Carlo Dropout.
We present results showing that uncertainty over obstacle distances is actually
better modeled with a Laplace distribution. Then, we propose a novel approach
to build maps based on Deep Neural Network uncertainty models. In particular,
we present an algorithm to build a map that includes information over obstacle
distance estimates while taking into account the level of uncertainty in each
estimate. We show how the constructed map can be used to increase global
navigation safety by planning trajectories which avoid areas of high
uncertainty, enabling higher autonomy for mobile robots in indoor settings.

transmitting fewer bits especially when the attack levels are low. Our

disclosed experimentally, much of physical behavior of transcription remains
largely unknown. Understanding torsional mechanics of DNA and RNAP together
with its nascent RNA and RNA-bound proteins in transcription maybe the first
step towards deciphering the mechanism of gene expression. In this study, based
on the balance between viscous drag on RNA synthesis and torque resulted from

mechanical properties of transcription. With this model, the rotation and
supercoiling density of the untranscribed DNA template are discussed in detail.
Two particular cases of transcription are considered, transcription with
constant velocity and transcription with torque dependent velocity. Our results
show that, during the initial stage of transcription, rotation originated from
the transcribed part of DNA template is mainly released by the rotation of RNAP
synthesis. During the intermediate stage, the rotation is usually released by
both the supercoiling of the untranscribed part of DNA template and the
rotation of RNAP synthesis, with proportion depending on the friction
coefficient in environment and the length of nascent RNA. However, with the
approaching to the upper limit of twisting of the untranscribed DNA template,
the rotation resulted from transcription will then be mainly released by the
rotation of RNAP synthesis.

Indeed, coherent structures play a determinant role on turbulence and flow
evolution. The goal of this numerical study is to apply the semi-deterministic
modelling, a method close to the large eddy simulation (LES), to the simulation
of compressible round jets. This allows the simulation of natural unsteadiness
without any flow excitation. A free jet configuration is computed for three
Mach numbers of 0.3, 0.96 and 1.5 to evaluate the influence of compressibility
effects on instability, Strouhal number and expansion rate. There is not
quantitative comparisons on flow quantities with experimental data, except for
the Strouhal number, due to the discrepancies between the configuration
computed here and those experimentally investigated in past studies. The
numerical results on coherent structures are validated across a comparison on
the Strouhal number of the preferred mode. The results on the evolution of the
Strouhal number with the Mach number are in excellent agreement with previous
experiments. Moreover, the evolution of the large scale vortices in the flow is

vulnerable to adversarial attack. This attack constructs adversarial examples
by adding small perturbations to the raw input, while appearing unmodified to
human eyes but will be misclassified by a well-trained classifier. In this
paper, we focus on the black-box attack setting where attackers have almost no
access to the underlying models. To conduct black-box attack, a popular
approach aims to train a substitute model based on the information queried from
the target DNN. The substitute model can then be attacked using existing
white-box attack approaches, and the generated adversarial examples will be
used to attack the target DNN. Despite its encouraging results, this approach
suffers from poor query efficiency, i.e., attackers usually needs to query a
huge amount of times to collect enough information for training an accurate
substitute model. To this end, we first utilize state-of-the-art white-box
attack methods to generate samples for querying, and then introduce an active
learning strategy to significantly reduce the number of queries needed.
Besides, we also propose a diversity criterion to avoid the sampling bias. Our
extensive experimental results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show that the proposed

rates and obtain an accurate substitute model which is more than $85\%$ similar

interaction strength (U of the order of the hopping amplitude t), using a
variational ansatz well suited for this regime. The wave function, a refined
Gutzwiller ansatz, has a BCS mean-field state with d-wave symmetry as its
reference state. Superconducting order is found for densities n <1 (but not for
n=1). This resolves a discrepancy between results obtained with the functional
renormalization group, which do predict superconducting order for small values
of U, and numerical simulations, which did not find superconductivity for U<4t.
Both the gap parameter and the order parameter have a dome-like shape as a
function of n with a maximum for n about 0.8. Expectation values for the
energy, the particle number and the superconducting order parameter are
calculated using a linked-cluster expansion up to second order in U. In this
way large systems (millions of sites) can be readily treated and well converged
results are obtained. A big size is indeed required to see that the gap becomes
very small at half filling and probably tends to zero in the thermodynamic
limit, whereas away from half filling a finite asymptotic limit is reached. For
a lattice of a given size the order parameter becomes finite only above a
minimal coupling strength U_c. This threshold value decreases steadily with
increasing system size, which indicates that superconductivity exists for
arbitrarily small U for an infinite system. For moderately large systems the
size dependence is quite irregular, due to variations in level spacings at the
Fermi energy. The fluctuations die out if the gap parameter spans several level
spacings.

system has been well studied. However, for a given fixed rate, how to quantize
the states so as to optimize performance is an open question of great
theoretical and practical significance. We concentrate on minimizing the
control cost for first-order scalar systems. To that end, we use the Lloyd-Max
algorithm and leverage properties of logarithmically-concave functions and
sequential Bayesian filtering to construct the optimal quantizer that greedily
minimizes the cost at every time instant. By connecting the globally optimal
scheme to the problem of scalar successive refinement, we argue that its gain
over the proposed greedy algorithm is negligible. This is significant since the
globally optimal scheme is often computationally intractable. All the results
are proven for the more general case of disturbances with
logarithmically-concave distributions and rate-limited time-varying noiseless
channels. We further extend the framework to event-triggered control by
allowing to convey information via an additional ""silent symbol"", i.e., by
avoiding transmitting bits; by constraining the minimal probability of silence
we attain a tradeoff between the transmission rate and the control cost for
rates below one bit per sample.

be avoided simultaneously, greatly reducing operation times compared to the

of the superadiabatic expansion where multiple counterdiabaticity conditions
can be met simultaneously. When transitions are strongly crowded, the system of
equations can instead be favorably solved by an average Hamiltonian (Magnus)
expansion, suggesting the use of additional sideband control. We give some

other factors affecting the ISN H distribution. We found that during most of
the solar cycle, the IKL18 model predicts larger densities of ISN H and PUIs
than ST09 in the inner heliosphere, especially in the downwind hemisphere.
However, the density of ISN H at the termination shock estimated by Bzowski et
al. 2008 obtained using ST09 does not need revision, and the detection of ISN D
by IBEX is supported. However, we point out the existence of a considerable
absorption of a portion of the solar Lyman-$\alpha$ spectral flux inside the
heliosphere. Therefore, the model of radiation pressure for ISN H is still
likely to need revision, and hence the available models of ISN H are not
self-consistent.

alpha-cluster formation probabilities in medium-mass and heavy even-even
nuclei, with $\mathfrak{O}$ being calculated from experimentally measured
charge radii. The trends of alpha-cluster formation probabilities are found to
be generally consistent with previous studies. The effects of various shell
closures on the alpha-cluster formation are identified, along with some hints
on a possible subshell structure at $N=106$ along the Hg and Pb isotopic
chains. The study here could be a useful complement to the traditional route to
probe alpha-cluster formation in medium-mass and heavy even-even nuclei using
alpha-decay data. Especially, it would be helpful in the cases where the target
nucleus is stable against alpha decay or alpha-decay data are currently not
available.

the retrograde orbit specifically. After obtaining the dominant Hamiltonian of

to generate phase-space portraits on a $e-\omega$ space. The retrograde 1:1

In the end, we further inspect the Kozai-Lidov dynamics inside the 2:1 and 2:5

which multiple UAVs are deployed as aerial base stations (BSs) to serve users
distributed on the ground. Different from prior works that ignore UAV's
backhaul connections, we practically consider that these UAVs are connected to
the core network through a ground gateway node via rate-limited multi-hop
wireless backhauls. We also consider that the air-to-ground (A2G) access links
from UAVs to users and the air-to-air (A2A) backhaul links among UAVs are
operated over orthogonal frequency bands. Under this setup, we aim to maximize
the common (or minimum) throughput among all the ground users in the downlink
of this network subject to the flow conservation constraints at the UAVs, by
optimizing the UAVs' deployment locations, jointly with the bandwidth and power
allocation of both the access and backhaul links. However, the common
throughput maximization is a non-convex optimization problem that is difficult
to be solved optimally. To tackle this issue, we use the techniques of
alternating optimization and successive convex programming (SCP) to obtain a
locally optimal solution. Numerical results show that the proposed design
significantly improves the common throughput among all ground users as compared

formulate an optimization problem that captures the amount of coordination gain
at the cost of node activation over networks. This problem is challenging to
solve in a distributed manner, since the target gain is a function of the
long-term time portion of the inter-coupled activations of two adjacent nodes,
and thus a standard Lagrange duality theory is hard to apply to obtain a
distributed decomposition as in the standard Network Utility Maximization. In
this paper, we propose three simulation-based distributed algorithms, each
having different update rules, all of which require only one-hop message
passing and locally-observed information. The key idea for being
distributedness is due to a stochastic approximation method that runs a Markov
chain simulation incompletely over time, but provably guarantees its
convergence to the optimal solution. Next, we provide a game-theoretic
framework to interpret our proposed algorithms from a different perspective. We
artificially select the payoff function, where the game's Nash equilibrium is
asymptotically equal to the socially optimal point, i.e., no Price-of-Anarchy.
We show that two stochastically-approximated variants of standard game-learning
dynamics overlap with two algorithms developed from the optimization
perspective. Finally, we demonstrate our theoretical findings on convergence,
optimality, and further features such as a trade-off between efficiency and
convergence speed through extensive simulations.

implying different nonperturbative contributions to the strange and antistrange

strange quark form factor predicts that the strange quark distribution is more
centralized in coordinate space than the antistrange quark distribution, and
thus the strange quark distribution is more spread out in light-front momentum
space. We show that the lattice prediction implies that the difference between
the strange and antistrange parton distribution functions, $s(x)-\bar{s}(x)$,
is negative at small-$x$ and positive at large-$x$. We also evaluate the
strange quark form factor and $s(x)-\bar{s}(x)$ using a baryon-meson
fluctuation model and a novel nonperturbative model based on light-front
holographic QCD. This procedure leads to a Veneziano-like expression of the
form factor, which depends exclusively on the twist of the hadron and the
properties of the Regge trajectory of the vector meson which couples to the
quark current in the hadron. The holographic structure of the model allows us
to introduce unambiguously quark masses in the form factors and quark
distributions preserving the hard scattering counting rule at large-$Q^2$ and
the inclusive counting rule at large-$x$. Quark masses modify the Regge
intercept which governs the small-$x$ behavior of quark distributions,
therefore modifying their small-$x$ singular behavior. Both nonperturbative
approaches provide descriptions of the strange-antistrange asymmetry and
intrinsic strangeness in the nucleon consistent with the lattice QCD result.

establishes a correspondence between images of a person from multiple cameras.
Deep Learning methods have been successfully applied to this problem and have

labeled training data. Currently labeled datasets in person re-id are limited
in their scale and manual acquisition of such large-scale datasets from
surveillance cameras is a tedious and labor-intensive task. In this paper, we
propose a framework that performs intelligent data augmentation and assigns
partial smoothing label to generated data. Our approach first exploits the
clustering property of existing person re-id datasets to create groups of
similar objects that model cross-view variations. Each group is then used to
generate realistic images through adversarial training. Our aim is to emphasize
feature similarity between generated samples and the original samples. Finally,
we assign a non-uniform label distribution to the generated samples and define
a regularized loss function for training. The proposed approach tackles two
problems (1) how to efficiently use the generated data and (2) how to address
the over-smoothness problem found in current regularization methods. Extensive
experiments on four larges cale datasets show that our regularization method

depletions and the ionization fraction in a set of prototypical star-forming
regions. This paper presents the first results from the prototypical dark cloud
TMC 1. Extensive millimeter observations have been carried out with the IRAM
30m telescope (3mm and 2mm) and the 40m Yebes telescope (1.3cm and 7mm) to
determine the fractional abundances of CO, HCO+, HCN, CS, SO, HCS+, and N2H+ in
three cuts which intersect the dense filament at the well-known positions TMC
1-CP, TMC 1-NH3, and TMC 1-C, covering a visual extinction range from Av~3 to
~20mag. Two phases with differentiated chemistry can be distinguished: i) the
translucent envelope with molecular hydrogen densities of (1-5)x10$^3$
cm$^{-3}$; and ii) the dense phase, located at Av>10mag, with molecular
hydrogen densities >10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$. Observations and modeling show that the
gas phase abundances of C and O progressively decrease along the C+/C/CO
transition zone where C/H~8x10$^{-5}$ and C/O~0.8-1, until the beginning of the
dense phase at Av~10 mag. This is consistent with the grain temperatures being
below the CO evaporation temperature in this region. In the case of sulfur, a
strong depletion should occur before the translucent phase where we estimate a
S/H~(0.4 - 2.2) x10$^{-6}$, an abundance ~7-40 times lower than the solar
value. A second strong depletion must be present during the formation of the
thick icy mantles to achieve the values of S/H measured in the dense cold cores
(S/H~8x10$^{-8}$). Based on our chemical modeling, we constrain the value of
$\zeta_{\rm H_2}$ to ~(0.5 - 1.8) x10$^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$ in the translucent
cloud.

$^{12}\mathrm{C}(^6\mathrm{Li},d)^{16}\mathrm{O}$. The $\alpha$-transfer
reaction is described by the distorted-wave Born approximation. We test two
microscopic wave functions as an input of reaction calculations. Then a
phenomenological potential model is introduced to clarify the correspondence
between cluster-wave functions and transfer-cross sections. Surface peaks of
the $\alpha$-wave function of $^{16}\mathrm{O}(0^+)$ are sensitively probed by
transfer-cross sections at forward angles, while it remains unclear how we
trace the surface behavior of $^{16}\mathrm{O}(4^+)$ from the cross sections.
We are able to specify that the $\alpha$-cluster structure in the $0_1^+$ and
$0_2^+$ states prominently manifests itself at the radii $\sim 4$ and $\sim
4.5$~fm, respectively. It is remarkable that the $4_1^+$ state has the
$^{12}\mathrm{C}+\alpha$-cluster component with the surface peak at the radius
$\sim 4$ or outer, whereas the $^{12}\mathrm{C}+\alpha$-cluster component in
the $4_2^+$ state is found not to be dominant. The $4_2^+$ state is difficult
to be interpreted by a simple potential model assuming the

reach Rosetta. In response to the compression, the flux of suprathermal
electrons increases by a factor of 5-10 and the background magnetic field

learning in remote sensing image scene classification. Although researches have
been done to tackle this issue by data augmentation with various image
transformation operations, they are still limited in quantity and diversity.
Recently, the advent of the unsupervised learning based generative adversarial
networks (GANs) bring us a new way to generate augmented samples. However, such
GAN-generated samples are currently only served for training GANs model itself
and for improving the performance of the discriminator in GANs internally (in
vivo). It becomes a question of serious doubt whether the GAN-generated samples
can help better improve the scene classification performance of other deep
learning networks (in vitro), compared with the widely used transformed
samples. To answer this question, this paper proposes a SiftingGAN approach to
generate more numerous, more diverse and more authentic labeled samples for
data augmentation. SiftingGAN extends traditional GAN framework with an
Online-Output method for sample generation, a Generative-Model-Sifting method
for model sifting, and a Labeled-Sample-Discriminating method for sample
sifting. Experiments on the well-known AID dataset demonstrate that the
proposed SiftingGAN method can not only effectively improve the performance of
the scene classification baseline that is achieved without data augmentation,
but also significantly excels the comparison methods based on traditional
geometric/radiometric transformation operations.

in order to solve the high-level task. For instance, the controller may learn
in what contexts to execute the perceptual networks and what symbolic

constraint and the LHC measurement of the Higgs diphoton decay rate. In this
work, the DM relic density is considered to arise from either a nonstandard
cosmology scenario or as a part of a larger sector encompassing other DM
particles, this in order to saturate the observed relic abundance. For these
scenarios we investigate the impact of the new sector in different collider
observables, and study constraints coming from direct detection and indirect
detection of gamma-rays both in the diffuse and linelike spectrum. As a result,
we find that in the nonstandard cosmology scenario most experiments impose, up

Equivalence Principle. The MICROSCOPE experiment implies that the relative
strength of a new long-range force, compared with gravity, is constrained to
$|\bar\alpha_g|<3.2\ 10^{-11},2.3\ 10^{-13},2.2\ 10^{-13},6.7\ 10^{-13}$ and
$1.5\ 10^{-12}$ at $2\sigma$, for a coupling to $B,\ L,\ B-L,\ B+L$ or $3B+L$;
or, for a coupling to isospin, $|\alpha_g|<8.4\ 10^{-12}$. This is a gain in
sensitivity $\simeq 3$ for a coupling to $B$, to $\approx$ 15 in the other
cases, including $B-L$ as suggested by grand unification.
  This requires paying attention to the definition of $\bar\alpha_g$. A force
coupled to $L$ (or $B-L$) would act effectively on protons (or neutrons) only,
its relative intensity being reduced from $\alpha_g$ to about
$\bar\alpha_g=\alpha_g/4$ for an average nucleon. It is thus convenient to view
such forces as acting on $\bar Q =B,\ 2L,\ 2(B-L),2(B+L)/3$ or $2(3B+L)/7$,
leading to $\bar\alpha_g=\alpha_g\times(1,1/4,1/4,9/4$ or $49/4$). The
sensitivity for a coupling to $L$ or $B-L$ is better than for $B$ by two orders
of magnitude (as $\Delta (2L/A_r)\simeq 144\ \Delta (B/A_r)$ for Ti-Pt); and
about 3 or 7 times better than for $B+L$ or $3B+L$.
  A coupling to $(\epsilon_BB+\epsilon_{Q_{el}}Q_{el})e$ should verify
$|\epsilon_B|<5\ 10^{-24}$; similarly $|\epsilon_L|$ or $|\epsilon_{B-L}|<.9\
10^{-24}$, $|\epsilon_{B+L}|<.5\ 10^{-24},|\epsilon_{3B+L}|<.32\ 10^{-24}$ and
$|\epsilon_{B-2L}|<2.6\ 10^{-24}$, implying a new interaction weaker than
electromagnetism by more than $10^{46}$ to $10^{48}$. The resulting hierarchy
between couplings, typically by $>10^{24}$, may be related within supersymmetry
with a large hierarchy in energy scales by $>10^{12}$. This points to a
$\sqrt\xi\approx 10^{16}$ GeV scale, associated with a huge vacuum energy
density that may be responsible for the inflation of the early Universe.

our analysis lies the Raychaudhuri equation, which is the fundamental formula
monitoring the convergence/divergence, namely the collapse/expansion, of
timelike worldline congruences. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the
most general expression so far of the Raychaudhuri equation, with applications
to an extensive range of non-standard astrophysical and cosmological studies.
Assuming that metricity holds, but allowing for nonzero torsion, we recover the
results of analogous previous treatments. Focusing on non-metricity alone, we
identify a host of effects that depend on the nature of the timelike congruence
and on the type of the adopted non-metricity. We also demonstrate that in
spaces of high symmetry one can recover the pure-torsion results from their
pure non-metricity analogues, and vice-versa, via a simple ansatz between

which are difficult to model physically. We propose a semiparametric model to
estimate the motion dynamics of the ball based on Gaussian Process Regression
equipped with basis functions obtained from physics first principles. The
accuracy of this semiparametric model is shown not only in estimation but also
in prediction at n-steps ahead and its compared with standard algorithms for
model learning. The learned model is then used in a trajectory optimization
algorithm to compute ball trajectories. We propose the system presented in the

the properties of the phase transition, such as the latent heat and the time

edge weights can achieve superior results compared to sparsely connected CRFs.
However, traditional methods for Full-CRFs are too expensive. Previous work
develops efficient approximate optimization based on mean field inference,
which is a local optimization method and can be far from the optimum. We
propose efficient and effective optimization based on graph cuts for Full-CRFs
with quantized edge weights. To quantize edge weights, we partition the image
into superpixels and assume that the weight of an edge between any two pixels
depends only on the superpixels these pixels belong to. Our quantized edge CRF
is an approximation to the Gaussian edge CRF, and gets closer to it as
superpixel size decreases. Being an approximation, our model offers an
intuition about the regularization properties of the Guassian edge Full-CRF.
For efficient inference, we first consider the two-label case and develop an
approximate method based on transforming the original problem into a smaller
domain. Then we handle multi-label CRF by showing how to implement expansion
moves. In both binary and multi-label cases, our solutions have significantly
lower energy compared to that of mean field inference. We also show the
effectiveness of our approach on semantic segmentation task.

Furthermore, we propose practical CMC algorithms by extending ordinary MC

  Methods: Single dish observations of various molecules that trace the cold,
warm and UV-irradiated gas are used to probe the temperature structure of
multiple and single protostellar systems on 7000 AU scales.
  Results: Single, close binary, and wide multiples present similar current
envelope gas temperatures, as estimated from H$_2$CO and DCO$^+$ line ratios.
The temperature of the outflow cavity, traced by c-C$_3$H$_2$, on the other

envelope mass. Although the envelope gas temperatures are similar for all
objects surveyed, wide multiples tend to exhibit a more massive reservoir of

nodes, i.e., the nodes requesting to leave the overlay network are excluded
from it without affecting its connectivity. To rigorously study self-tabilizing
solutions to this problem, the Finite Departure Problem (FDP) has been proposed
[12]. In the FDP we are given a network of processes in an arbitrary state, and
the goal is to eventually arrive at (and stay in) a state in which all leaving
processes irrevocably decided to leave the system while for all
weakly-connected components in the initial overlay network, all staying
processes in that component will still form a weakly connected component. In
the standard interconnection model, the FDP is known to be unsolvable by local
control protocols, so oracles have been investigated that allow the problem to
be solved [12]. To avoid the use of oracles, we introduce a new interconnection
model based on relays. Despite the relay model appearing to be rather
restrictive, we show that it is universal, i.e., it is possible to transform
any weakly-connected topology into any other weakly-connected topology, which

must decide to leave a current resource in search for another. Theoretical work
has derived optimal strategies for when to leave a patch, and experiments have
tested for conditions where animals do or do not follow an optimal strategy.
Nevertheless, models of patch-leaving decisions do not consider the imperfect
and noisy sampling process through which an animal gathers information, and how
this process is constrained by neurobiological mechanisms. In this theoretical
study, we formulate an evidence accumulation model of patch-leaving decisions
where the animal averages over noisy measurements to estimate the state of the
current patch and the overall environment. Evidence accumulation models belong
to the class of drift diffusion processes and have been used to model decision
making in different contexts. We solve the model for conditions where foraging
decisions are optimal and equivalent to the marginal value theorem, and perform
simulations to analyze deviations from optimal when these conditions are not
met. By adjusting the drift rate and decision threshold, the model can
represent different strategies, for example an increment-decrement or counting
strategy. These strategies yield identical decisions in the limiting case but
differ in how patch residence times adapt when the foraging environment is
uncertain. To account for sub-optimal decisions, we introduce an
energy-dependent utility function that predicts longer than optimal patch
residence times when food is plentiful. Our model provides a quantitative
connection between ecological models of foraging behavior and evidence
accumulation models of decision making. Moreover, it provides a theoretical
framework for potential experiments which seek to identify neural circuits

understanding systems biology, one needs to understand the pathway of the
genetic effects on risk factors/disease through intermediate molecular levels,
such as metabolomics. Systems approaches integrate multi-omic information to
find pathways to disease endpoints and make optimal inference decisions.
Method: Here, we introduce a multi-stage approach to integrate causal networks
in observational studies and GWAS to facilitate mechanistic understanding
through identification of pathways from the genome to risk factors/disease via
metabolomics. The pathways in causal networks reveal the underlying
relationships behind observations, which do not play a significant role in more
traditional correlative analyses, where one variable at a time is considered.
Results: We identified a causal network over the metabolomic level using the
genome directed acyclic graph (G-DAG), to systematically assess whether
variations in the genome lead to variations in triglyceride levels as a risk
factor of cardiovascular disease. We found LRRC46 and LRRC69 harboring
loss-of-function mutations have significant effect on two metabolites with
direct effects on triglyceride levels. We also found pathways of FAM198B and
C6orf25 to triglycerides through indirect paths from metabolites. Conclusion:
Integrating causal networks with GWAS facilitates mechanistic understanding in
comparison to one-variable-at-a-time approaches due to accounting for
relationships among components at intermediate molecular levels. This approach
is complementary to experimental studies to identify efficacious targets in the
age of big data sets.

SGX, a number of cloud providers will soon introduce TEE capabilities within
their offering (e.g., Microsoft Azure). Although the integration of SGX within
the cloud considerably strengthens the threat model for cloud applications, the
current model to deploy and provision enclaves prevents the cloud operator from
adding or removing enclaves dynamically - thus preventing elasticity for
TEE-based applications in the cloud.
  In this paper, we propose ReplicaTEE, a solution that enables seamless
provisioning and decommissioning of TEE-based applications in the cloud.
ReplicaTEE leverages an SGX-based provisioning layer that interfaces with a
Byzantine Fault-Tolerant storage service to securely orchestrate enclave
replication in the cloud, without the active intervention of the application
owner. Namely, in ReplicaTEE, the application owner entrusts application secret
to the provisioning layer; the latter handles all enclave commissioning and
de-commissioning operations throughout the application lifetime. We analyze the
security of ReplicaTEE and show that it is secure against attacks by a powerful
adversary that can compromise a large fraction of the cloud infrastructure. We
implement a prototype of ReplicaTEE in a realistic cloud environment and
evaluate its performance. ReplicaTEE moderately increments the TCB by ~800 LoC.
Our evaluation shows that ReplicaTEE does not add significant overhead to
existing SGX-based applications.

learners must overcome a number of pathologies to learn optimal joint policies.
Addressing one pathology often leaves approaches vulnerable towards others. For
instance, hysteretic Q-learning addresses miscoordination while leaving agents
vulnerable towards misleading stochastic rewards. Other methods, such as
leniency, have proven more robust when dealing with multiple pathologies
simultaneously. However, leniency has predominately been studied within the
context of strategic form games (bimatrix games) and fully observable Markov
games consisting of a small number of probabilistic state transitions. This
raises the question of whether these findings scale to more complex domains.
For this purpose we implement a temporally extend version of the Climb Game,
within which agents must overcome multiple pathologies simultaneously,
including relative overgeneralisation, stochasticity, the alter-exploration and
moving target problems, while learning from a large observation space. We find
that existing lenient and hysteretic approaches fail to consistently learn near
optimal joint-policies in this environment. To address these pathologies we
introduce Negative Update Intervals-DDQN (NUI-DDQN), a Deep MA-RL algorithm
which discards episodes yielding cumulative rewards outside the range of
expanding intervals. NUI-DDQN consistently gravitates towards optimal
joint-policies in our environment, overcoming the outlined pathologies.

listing a small and fixed number of universities and majors they intend to
attend and study. About 9.5 million high- school seniors participate in Gaokao
every year, and the Gaokao scores are good for just one year. A student has a
strong chance to be accepted if their Gaokao score is better than the admission
scores of the universities they selected in their applications. However, the
admission scores of universities are unknown at the time when filling out
applications, which to be determined dynamically during the admission process
and may fluctuate from year to year. To increase their chances of acceptance to

thoughtfully compare the quality of the numerical results obtained with three
different schemes and two different bulk energy potentials. Especially, we

This has raised concerns about possible biases and discrimination that such

Observation bias exists due to a feedback loop which causes the model to learn
to only predict recommendations similar to previous ones. Imbalance in data
occurs when systematic societal, historical, or other ambient bias is present
in the data. In this paper, we address both biases by proposing a hybrid

that was simultaneously initiated across an entire population of units at a
single point in time, and its effects over the targeted population can manifest
at any time period afterwards. In the presence of data measured over time,
Bayesian time series models have been used to impute what would have happened
after the policy was initiated, had the policy not taken place, in order to
estimate causal effects. However, the considerations regarding the definition
of the target estimands, the underlying assumptions, the plausibility of such
assumptions, and the choice of an appropriate model have not been thoroughly
investigated. In this paper, we establish useful estimands for the evaluation
of large-scale policies. We discuss that imputation of missing potential
outcomes relies on an assumption which, even though untestable, can be
partially evaluated using observed data. We illustrate an approach to evaluate
this key causal assumption and facilitate model elicitation based on data from
the time interval before policy initiation and using classic statistical
techniques. As an illustration, we study the Hospital Readmissions Reduction
Program (HRRP), a US federal intervention aiming to improve health outcomes for
patients with pneumonia, acute myocardial infraction, or congestive failure
admitted to a hospital. We evaluate the effect of the HRRP on population
