as different aspects of a single underlying resource theory defined through
simple and operationally meaningful elemental operations. This is achieved by
revisiting the resource theory defining entanglement, Local Operations and
Classical Communication (LOCC), placing the focus on the underlying quantum
nature of the communication channels. Taking the natural elemental operations
in the resulting generalization of LOCC yields a resource theory that singles
out coherence in the wire connecting the spatially separated systems as an
operationally useful resource. The approach naturally allows to consider a
reduced setting as well, namely the one with only the wire connected to a
single quantum system, which leads to discord-like resources. The general form
of free operations in this latter setting is derived and presented as a closed
form. We discuss in what sense the present approach defines a resource theory
of quantum discord and in which situations such an interpretation is sound --
and why in general discord is not a resource. This unified and operationally
meaningful approach makes transparent many features of entanglement that in
LOCC might seem surprising, such as the possibility to use a particle to
entangle two parties, without it ever being entangled with either of them, or
that there exist different forms of multipartite entanglement.

commonly used to estimate the model parameters of non-linear, computationally
expensive models using measurement data. The approach is based on Bayesian
statistics: using a prior distribution and a likelihood, the posterior
distribution is obtained through application of Bayes' law. Our novel algorithm
to accurately determine this posterior requires significantly fewer discrete
model evaluations than traditional Monte Carlo methods. The key idea is to
replace the expensive model by an interpolating surrogate model and to
construct the interpolating nodal set maximizing the accuracy of the posterior.
To determine such a nodal set an extension to weighted Leja nodes is
introduced, based on a new weighting function. We prove that the convergence of
the posterior has the same rate as the convergence of the model. If the
convergence of the posterior is measured in the Kullback-Leibler divergence,
the rate doubles. The algorithm and its theoretical properties are verified in
three different test cases: analytical cases that confirm the correctness of
the theoretical findings, Burgers' equation to show its applicability in
implicit problems, and finally the calibration of the closure parameters of a
turbulence model to show the effectiveness for computationally expensive
problems.

super-resolution to fill in those voxels that are missing due to the device's
limited pixel count. The second scheme, in link with compressed sensing,
introduces spatial random convolutions, but is more complex and may be affected
by diffraction. In both cases we solve the associated inverse problems by using
the same signal prior. Specifically, we propose a redundant analysis signal
prior in a convex formulation. Through numerical simulations, we explore
different realistic setups. Our objective is also to highlight some practical

an equivalent but smaller input whose size is provably bounded in terms of
structural properties, such as the size of a minimum vertex cover. In this
paper we settle two open problems about data reduction for q-Coloring.
  First, we obtain a kernel of bitsize $O(k^{q-1}\log{k})$ for q-Coloring
parameterized by Vertex Cover, for any q >= 3. This size bound is optimal up to
$k^{o(1)}$ factors assuming NP is not a subset of coNP/poly, and improves on
the previous-best kernel of size $O(k^q)$. We generalize this result for
deciding q-colorability of a graph G, to deciding the existence of a
homomorphism from G to an arbitrary fixed graph H. Furthermore, we can replace
the parameter vertex cover by the less restrictive parameter twin-cover. We
prove that H-Coloring parameterized by Twin-Cover has a kernel of size
$O(k^{\Delta(H)}\log k)$.
  Our second result shows that 3-Coloring does not admit non-trivial
sparsification: assuming NP is not a subset of coNP/poly, the parameterization

efficiency and extent of near core mixing processes, which effectively
increases both the core mass and main-sequence lifetime. We investigate to what
extent gravity-mode period spacings in slowly pulsating B-type stars observed
by the Kepler mission can be used to constrain both the shape and extent of
convective core overshoot and additional mixing in the radiative envelope. We
compute grids of 1D stellar structure and evolution models for two different
shapes of convective core overshooting and three shapes of radiative envelope
mixing. The models in these grids are compared to a set of benchmark models to
evaluate their capability of mimicking the dipole prograde g-modes of the
benchmark models. Through our model comparisons we find that at a central
hydrogen content of Xc = 0.5, dipole prograde g-modes in the period range 0.8-3
d are capable of differentiating between step and exponential diffusive
overshooting. This ability disappears towards the terminal age main-sequence at
Xc = 0.1. Furthermore, the g-modes behave the same for the three different
shapes of radiative envelope mixing considered. However, a constant envelope
mixing requires a diffusion coefficient near the convective core five times
higher than chemical mixing from internal gravity waves to obtain a surface
nitrogen excess of about 0.5 dex within the main-sequence lifetime. Within
estimated frequency errors of the Kepler mission, the ability of g-modes to
distinguish between step and exponential diffusive overshooting depends on the
evolutionary stage. Combining information from the average period spacing and
observed surface abundances, notably nitrogen, could potentially be used to
constrain the shape of mixing in the radiative envelope of massive stars.

In this work, we present stringent results for equilibration for systems in

Our results reverse the logic of common arguments, in that we derive

Here, we propose an entropy-based method to predict a given percentage of

The probability coefficients are computed by solving opportunely defined
null-models over the accessible network structure. Upon comparing our
likelihood-based, local method with the most popular algorithms over a set of
economic, financial and food networks, we find ours to perform best, as pointed
out by a number of statistical indicators (e.g. the precision, the area under
the ROC curve, etc.). Moreover, the entropy-based formalism adopted in the
present paper allows us to straightforwardly extend the link-prediction
exercise to directed networks as well, thus overcoming one of the main
limitations of current algorithms. The higher accuracy achievable by employing
these methods - together with their larger flexibility - makes them strong
competitors of available link-prediction algorithms.

complex (IC) is assembled on a messenger RNA (mRNA) template. In bacteria, the
speed and accuracy of this assembly process are regulated by the complementary
activities of three essential initiation factors (IFs). Selection of an
authentic N-formylmethionyl-transfer RNA (fMet-tRNA\textsuperscript{fMet}) and
the canonical, triplet-nucleotide mRNA start codon are crucial events during
assembly of a canonical, ribosomal 70S IC. Mis-initiation due to the aberrant
selection of an elongator tRNA or a non-canonical start codon are rare events
that result in the assembly of a pseudo 70S IC or a non-canonical 70S IC,
respectively. Here, we have developed a theoretical model for the stochastic
kinetics of canonical-, pseudo-, and non-canonical 70S IC assembly that
includes all of the major steps of the IC assembly process that have been
observed and characterized in ensemble kinetic-, single-molecule kinetic-, and
structural studies of the fidelity of translation initiation. Specifically, we
use the rates of the individual steps in the IC assembly process and the
formalism of first-passage times to derive exact analytical expressions for the
probability distributions for the assembly of canonical-, pseudo- and
non-canonical 70S ICs. In order to illustrate the power of this analytical
approach, we compare the theoretically predicted first-passage time
distributions with the corresponding computer simulation data. We also compare
the mean times required for completion of these assemblies with experimental
estimates. In addition to generating new, testable hypotheses, our theoretical
model can also be easily extended as new experimental 70S IC assembly data
become available, thereby providing a versatile tool for interpreting these
data and developing advanced models of the mechanism and regulation of
translation initiation.

lightcurves for spherical harmonic albedo maps in the special case of a
synchronously-rotating planet on an edge-on orbit (Cowan, Fuentes & Haggard
2013). In this paper, we present analytic reflected lightcurves for the general
case of a planet on an inclined orbit, with arbitrary spin period and non-zero
obliquity. We do so for two different albedo basis maps: bright points
($\delta$-maps), and spherical harmonics ($Y_l^m$-maps). In particular, we use
Wigner $D$-matrices to express an harmonic lightcurve for an arbitrary viewing
geometry as a non-linear combination of harmonic lightcurves for the simpler
edge-on, synchronously rotating geometry. These solutions will enable future
exploration of the degeneracies and information content of reflected
lightcurves, as well as fast calculation of lightcurves for mapping exoplanets
based on time-resolved photometry. To these ends we make available Exoplanet
Analytic Reflected Lightcurves (EARL), a simple open-source code that allows
rapid computation of reflected lightcurves.

promise for achieving high-rate communication in next-generation wireless
networks. Cloud radio access network (CRAN), in which low-complexity remote
radio heads (RRHs) coordinated by a central unit (CU) are deployed to serve
users in a distributed manner, is a cost-effective solution to achieve network
densification. However, when operating over a large bandwidth in the mmWave
frequencies, the digital fronthaul links in a CRAN would be easily saturated by
the large amount of sampled and quantized signals to be transferred between
RRHs and the CU. To tackle this challenge, we propose in this paper a new
architecture for mmWave-based CRAN with advanced lens antenna arrays at the
RRHs. Due to the energy focusing property, lens antenna arrays are effective in
exploiting the angular sparsity of mmWave channels, and thus help in
substantially reducing the fronthaul rate and simplifying the signal processing
at the multi-antenna RRHs and the CU, even when the channels are
frequency-selective. We consider the uplink transmission in a mmWave CRAN with
lens antenna arrays and propose a low-complexity quantization bit allocation
scheme for multiple antennas at each RRH to meet the given fronthaul rate
constraint. Further, we propose a channel estimation technique that exploits
the energy focusing property of the lens array and can be implemented at the CU
with low complexity. Finally, we compare the proposed mmWave CRAN using lens
antenna arrays with a conventional CRAN using uniform planar arrays at the
RRHs, and show that the proposed design achieves significant throughput gains,
yet with much lower complexity.

time-varying ellipse is introduced. For any ellipse advected by an arbitrary
linear two-dimensional flow, the rates of change of the ellipse parameters are
uniquely determined by the four parameters of the velocity gradient matrix, and
vice versa. This result, termed ellipse/flow equivalence, provides a stronger
version of the well-known result that a linear velocity field maps an ellipse
into another ellipse. Moreover, ellipse/flow equivalence is shown to be a
manifestation of Stokes' theorem. This is done by deriving a matrix-valued
extension of the classical Stokes' theorem that involves a spatial integral
over the velocity gradient tensor, thus accounting for the two strain terms in
addition to the divergence and vorticity. General expressions for various
physical properties of an elliptical ring of fluid are also derived. The
ellipse kinetic energy is found to be composed of three portions, associated
respectively with the circulation, the rate of change of the moment of inertia,
and the variance of parcel angular velocity around the ellipse. A particular
innovation is the use of four matrices, termed the IJKL basis, that greatly
facilitate the required calculations.

internal activations over a sequence of cloudy and non-cloudy images and find
several recurrent cells, which reduce the input activity for cloudy

utility maximization subject to a bounded delay constraint and network

correction and a custom cosmic ray correction routine, we confirm the general
shape of the transmission spectra presented by \textbf{\citet{deWit2016,
deWit2018}}. Our data reduction approach leads to a 25\% increase in the usable
data and reduces the risk of confusing astrophysical brightness variations
(e.g., flares) with instrumental systematics. No prominent absorption features
are detected in any individual planet's transmission spectra; by contrast, the
combined spectrum of the planets shows a suggestive decrease around
1.4\,$\micron$ similar to an inverted water absorption feature. Including
transit depths from \textit{K2}, the SPECULOOS-South Observatory, and
\textit{Spitzer}, we find that the complete transmission spectrum is fully
consistent with stellar contamination owing to the transit light source effect.
These spectra demonstrate how stellar contamination can overwhelm planetary
absorption features in low-resolution exoplanet transit spectra obtained by

with this interpretation is to reconcile it with classical physics. To avoid
macroscopic backward causation two 'corresponding transition rules' are
formulated which specify needed properties of macroscopic observations and
manipulations. The apparent classical causal decision tree requires to
understand the classically unchosen options. They are taken to occur with an
'incomplete knowledge' of the boundary states typically in macroscopic
considerations. The precise boundary conditions with given phases then select
the actual measured path and this selection is mistaken to happen at the time
of measurement. The apparent time direction of the decision tree originates in
an assumed relative proximity to the initial state. Only the far away final
state allows for classically distinct options to be selected from.
Cosmologically the picture could correspond to a big bang initial and a hugely
extended final state scenario. It is speculated that it might also hold for a
big bang/big crunch world. If this would be the case the Born probability
postulate could find a natural explanation if we coexist in the expanding and

perturbative uncertainties. We then extend our study to NNLO by using smooth
cone isolation. We discuss the impact of the NNLO corrections and the
corresponding perturbative uncertainties for both fiducial cross sections and
distributions, and we comment on the comparison with some LHC data. Throughout
our study we remark the main features that are produced by the kinematical
selection cuts that are applied to the photons. In particular, we examine
soft-gluon singularities that appear in the perturbative computations of the
invariant mass distribution of the photon pair, the transverse-momentum spectra
of the photons, and the fiducial cross section with asymmetric and symmetric
photon transverse-momentum cuts, and we present their behaviour in analytic
form.

to be described by the physics of d-wave BCS-like superconductivity. However,

theory in the absence of disorder. Here, we combine time-domain THz
spectroscopy with kHz range mutual inductance measurements on the same
overdoped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ films to determine both the superfluid

fraction of the carriers remains uncondensed in a wide Drude-like peak even as
$T\rightarrow0$, which, when taken with the linear-in-temperature superfluid
density, is inconsistent with existing theories for the role of disorder in
suppressing the superfluid density in a d-wave superconductor. Our almost eight
orders of magnitude in measurement frequency range gives us a unique look at
the low frequency spectral weight distribution, which may suggest the presence
of quantum phase fluctuations as the critical doping is approached.

intra- and intercycle interference patterns which work as two separate grids in
the two-dimensional momentum domain. We use a three dimensional (3D)
description based on the saddle-point approximation (SPA) to unravel the nature
of these structures. When the periods of the two grids (intra- and intercycle)
are similar, principal moir\'{e} patterns arise as concentric rings
symmetrically in the forward and backward directions at high electron kinetic
energy. Higher order moir\'{e} patterns are observed and characterized when the
period of one grid is multiple of the other. We find a scale law for the
position (in momentum space) of the center of the moir\'{e} rings in the

the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2016 and correspond to an integrated

are interpreted in the context of simplified models of SUSY that assume the
production of gluino or squark pairs and their prompt decay to quarks and the
lightest neutralino. The masses of bottom, top, and mass-degenerate
light-flavour squarks are probed up to 1050, 1000, and 1325 GeV, respectively.
The gluino mass is probed up to 1900, 1650, and 1650 GeV when the gluino decays
via virtual states of the aforementioned squarks. The strongest mass bounds on
the neutralinos from gluino and squark decays are 1150 and 575 GeV,
respectively. The search also provides sensitivity to simplified models
inspired by split SUSY that involve the production and decay of long-lived
gluinos. Values of the proper decay length $c\tau$ from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{5}$
mm are considered, as well as a metastable gluino scenario. Gluino masses up to
1750 and 900 GeV are probed for $c\tau =$ 1 mm and for the metastable state,
respectively. The sensitivity is moderately dependent on model assumptions for
$c\tau \gtrsim 1$ m. The search provides coverage of the $c\tau$ parameter
space for models involving long-lived gluinos that is complementary to existing
techniques at the LHC.

source of hard, synchrotron-like x-ray radiation. It emanates from a centimetre
scale plasma accelerator producing GeV level electron beams. In recent years
betatron radiation has been developed as a unique source capable of producing
high resolution x-ray images in compact geometries. However, until now, the
short pulse nature of this radiation has not been exploited. This report
details the first experiment to utilise betatron radiation to image a rapidly
evolving phenomenon by using it to radiograph a laser driven shock wave in a
silicon target. The spatial resolution of the image is comparable to what has
been achieved in similar experiments at conventional synchrotron light sources.
The intrinsic temporal resolution of betatron radiation is below 100 fs,
indicating that significantly faster processes could be probed in future
without compromising spatial resolution. Quantitative measurements of the shock
velocity and material density were made from the radiographs recorded during

metastructures that may exhibit novel electrical transport phenomena. Here, we
investigate the electrical current passing through one such metastructure, a
system composed of quantum dots placed at the vertices of a triangle. The wave
natural of quantum particles leads to internal current circulation within the
metastructure in the absence of any external magnetic field. We uncover the
relation between its steady-state total current and the internal circulation.
By calculating the electronic correlations in quantum transport exactly, we
present phase diagrams showing where different types of current circulation can
be found as a function of the correlation strength and the coupling between the
quantum dots. Finally, we show that the regimes of current circulation can be
further enhanced or reduced depending on the local spatial distribution of the
interactions, suggesting a single-particle scattering mechanism is at play even
in the strongly-correlated regime. We suggest experimental realizations of
actual quantum-dot metastructures where our predictions can be directly tested.

only 492 central stars of Galactic planetary nebulae (CSPN) have known spectral
types. It is vital to increase this number in order to have reliable
statistics, which will lead to an increase of our understanding of these
amazing objects.
  Aims. We aim to contribute to the knowledge of central stars of planetary
nebulae and stellar evolution.
  Methods. This observational study is based on Gemini Multi-Object
Spectrographs (GMOS) and with the Intermediate Dispersion Spectrograph (IDS) at
the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) spectra of 78 CSPN. The objects were selected
because they did not have any previous classification, or the present
classification is ambiguous. These new high quality spectra allowed us to
identify the key stellar lines for determining spectral classification in the
Morgan-Keenan (MK) system.
  Results. We have acquired optical spectra of a large sample of CSPN. From the
observed targets, 50 are classified here for the first time while for 28 the
existing classifications have been improved. In seven objects we have
identified a P-Cygni profile at the He i lines. Six of these CSPN are late
O-type. The vast majority of the stars in the sample exhibit an absorption-type
spectrum, and in one case we have found wide emission lines typical of [WR]
stars. We give a complementary, and preliminary, classification criterion to
obtain the sub-type of the O(H)-type CSPN. Finally, we give a more realistic
value of the proportion of CSPN that are rich or poor in hydrogen.

complex mathematical concepts to enforce the symmetry of the stress tensor
either weakly or strongly. A novel procedure to construct element-by-element a

large increases in collateral volumes already with small network density.
Furthermore, we introduce in the model collateral hoarding rates determined

of collateral hoarding cascades in different networks. Our results highlight
that network structures with highly concentrated collateral flows are also more

theory has $\frac{n(n-3)}{2}+1$ degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) in $n$ dimensions.
We start from a scalar-tensor action for the theory, which represents a scalar
field minimally coupled with the torsion scalar $T$ that defines the
teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) Lagrangian. $T$ is written
as a quadratic form of the coefficients of anholonomy of the vierbein. We
obtain the primary constraints through the analysis of the structure of the
eigenvalues of the multi-index matrix involved in the definition of the
canonical momenta. The auxiliary scalar field generates one extra primary
constraint when compared with the TEGR case. The secondary constraints are the
super-Hamiltonian and supermomenta constraints, that are preserved from the
Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formulation of GR. There is a set of $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$
primary constraints that represent the local Lorentz transformations of the
theory, which can be combined to form a set of $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}-1$ first-class
constraints, while one of them becomes second-class. This result is
irrespective of the dimension, due to the structure of the matrix of the
brackets between the constraints. The first-class canonical Hamiltonian is
modified due to this local Lorentz violation, and the only one local Lorentz
transformation that becomes second-class pairs up with the second-class
constraint $\pi \approx 0$ to remove one d.o.f. from the $n^2+1$ pairs of
canonical variables. The remaining $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}+2n-1$ primary constraints
remove the same number of d.o.f., leaving the theory with $\frac{n(n-3)}{2}+1$
d.o.f. This means that $f(T)$ gravity has only one extra d.o.f., which could be
interpreted as a scalar d.o.f.

  Theory, January 2018",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, new two-user multiple access wiretap channel models are
studied. First, the multiple access wiretap channel II with a discrete
memoryless main channel, under three different wiretapping scenarios, is
introduced. The wiretapper, as in the classical wiretap channel II model,
chooses a fixed-length subset of the channel uses on which she obtains
noise-free observations of one of the codewords, a superposition of the two
codewords, or each of the two codewords. These thus extend the recently
examined wiretap channel II with a noisy main channel to a multiple access
setting with a variety of attack models for the wiretapper. Next, a new
multiple access wiretap channel model, which further generalizes the multiple
access wiretap channel II under the third wiretapping scenario, i.e., that
which features the strongest adversarial model, is proposed. In this model, the
wiretapper, besides choosing a subset of the channel uses to noiselessly
observe the transmitted codeword symbols of both users, observes the remainder
of the two codewords through a discrete memoryless multiple access channel.
Achievable strong secrecy rate regions for all the proposed models are derived.
Achievability is established by solving dual multi-terminal secret key
agreement problems in the source model, and converting the solution to the
original channel models using probability distribution approximation arguments.
The derived achievable rate regions quantify the secrecy cost due to the
additional capabilities of the wiretapper with respect to the previous multiple
access wiretap models.

The EUV scenario is supported by existing mid-infrared data and should be
further tested by future dust reverberation observations. The jet scenario is
disfavored by the radio observations of ASASSN-14li but may still be viable for
other TDE candidates. We also provide evidence that, at least for some TDEs,
most of the missing energy (in the EUV and/or in the form of jets) is released
within a few times the orbital period of the most tightly bound material, which
means (1) the circularization of the fallback stream may occur rapidly, and (2)
the luminosity of the accretion flow or the jet power may not be capped near
the Eddington level when the fallback rate is super-Eddington. For most other
TDEs, this energy-release timescale is currently not strongly constrained.

chemically due to radiogenic heating from Al-26. Here we quantify the
parametric controls on magma genesis and transport using a coupled petrological
and fluid mechanical model of reactive two-phase flow. We find the mean grain
size of silicate minerals to be a key control on magma ascent. For grain sizes
larger than $\approx$ 1 mm, melt segregation produces distinct radial structure
and chemical stratification. This stratification is most pronounced for bodies
formed at around 1 Myr after formation of Ca,Al-rich inclusions. These findings
suggest a link between the time and orbital location of planetesimal formation
and their subsequent structural and chemical evolution. According to our
models, the evolution of partially molten planetesimal interiors falls into two
categories. In the magma ocean scenario, the whole interior of a planetesimal
experiences nearly complete melting, which would result in turbulent convection
and core-mantle differentiation by the rainfall mechanism. In the magma sill
scenario, segregating melts gradually deplete the deep interior of the
radiogenic heat source. In this case, magma may form melt-rich layers beneath a
cool and stable lid, while core formation would proceed by percolation. Our
findings suggest that grain sizes prevalent during the internal heating stage
governed magma ascent in planetesimals. Regardless of whether evolution
progresses toward a magma ocean or magma sill structure, our models predict
that temperature inversions due to rapid Al-26 redistribution are limited to
bodies formed earlier than $\approx$ 1 Myr after CAIs. We find that if grain
size was smaller than $\approx$ 1 mm during peak internal melting, only
elevated solid-melt density contrasts (such as found for enstatite chondrite
compositions) would allow substantial melt segregation to occur.

its derivation, we concentrate on formulation of the ""final product"" in its
most general form: a minimal set of assumptions about the algebraic structure
and the analyticity of the $Q$-system -- the full system of Baxter
$Q$-functions of the underlying integrable model. The algebraic structure of
the $Q$-system is entirely based on (super)symmetry of the model and is
efficiently described by Wronskian formulas for $Q$-functions organized into
the Hasse diagram. When supplemented with analyticity conditions on
$Q$-functions, it fixes completely the set of physical solutions for spectrum
of an integrable model. First we demonstrate the spectral equations on the
example of $gl(N)$ and $gl(K|M)$ Heisenberg (super)spin chains. Supersymmetry
$gl(K|M)$ occurs as a ""rotation"" of the Hasse diagram for a $gl(K+M)$ system.
This picture helps us to construct the QSC formalism for spectrum of
AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$-duality, with more complicated analyticity constraints on
$Q$-functions which involve an infinitely branching Riemann surface and a set
of Riemann-Hilbert conditions. As an example of application of QSC, we consider
a special double scaling limit of $\gamma$-twisted ${\cal\ N}=4$ SYM, combining
weak coupling and strong imaginary twist. This leads to a new type of
non-unitary CFT dominated by particular integrable, and often computable, 4D
fishnet Feynman graphs. For the simplest of such models -- the bi-scalar theory
-- the QSC degenerates into the $Q$-system for integrable non-compact
Heisenberg spin chain with conformal, $SU(2,2)$ symmetry. We apply the QSC for

the synchronization frequency and may be used as a purely electronic way of
realizing Floquet states respecting exotic space time crystalline symmetries.

properties in galaxy mergers at low redshift (z$\leq$0.06). The study we
present is based on IRAM 30-m CO(1-0) observations of 11 galaxies with a close
companion selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The pairs have
mass ratios $\leq$4, projected separations r$_{\mathrm{p}} \leq$30 kpc and
velocity separations $\Delta$V$\leq$300 km s$^{-1}$, and have been selected to
exhibit enhanced specific star formation rates (sSFR). We calculate molecular
gas (H$_{2}$) masses, assigning to each galaxy a physically motivated
conversion factor $\alpha_{\mathrm{CO}}$, and we derive molecular gas fractions
and depletion times. We compare these quantities with those of isolated
galaxies from the extended CO Legacy Data base for the GALEX Arecibo SDSS
Survey sample (xCOLDGASS, Saintonge et al. 2017) with gas quantities computed
in an identical way. Ours is the first study which directly compares the gas
properties of galaxy pairs and those of a control sample of normal galaxies
with rigorous control procedures and for which SFR and H$_{2}$ masses have been
estimated using the same method. We find that the galaxy pairs have shorter
depletion times and an average molecular gas fraction enhancement of 0.4 dex
compared to the mass matched control sample drawn from xCOLDGASS. However, the
gas masses (and fractions) in galaxy pairs and their depletion times are
consistent with those of non-mergers whose SFRs are similarly elevated. We
conclude that both external interactions and internal processes may lead to
molecular gas enhancement and decreased depletion times.

""New Numerical Galaxy Catalogue"", which is combined with large cosmological
N-body simulations. This model can reproduce statistical properties of galaxies
at z < 6.0. We focus on the properties of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and
supermassive black holes, especially on the accretion timescale onto black
holes. We find that the number density of AGNs at z < 1.5 and at hard X-ray
luminosity 10^{ 44 }< erg/s is underestimated compared with recent
observational estimates when we assume the exponentially decreasing accretion
rate and the accretion timescale which is proportional to the dynamical time of
the host halo or the bulge, as is often assumed in semi-analytic models. We
show that to solve this discrepancy, the accretion timescale of such less
luminous AGNs instead should be a function of the black hole mass and the
accreted gas mass. This timescale can be obtained from a phenomenological
modelling of the gas angular momentum loss in the circumnuclear torus and/or
the accretion disc. Such models predict a longer accretion timescale for less
luminous AGNs at z < 1.0 than bright QSOs whose accretion timescale would be
10^{ 7-8 } yr. With this newly introduced accretion timescale, our model can
explain the observed luminosity functions of AGNs at z < 6.0.

substantially by the inclusion of the recent measurement on HfF+ ions, but
complicated by the fact that the corresponding constraints are largely aligned,
owing to a general relation between the coefficients for the two contributions.
Since this same relation does not hold in diamagnetic systems, it is possible
to find atoms that provide essentially orthogonal constraints to those from
para\-magnetic ones. However, the coefficients are suppressed in closed-shell
systems and enhancements of P,T-odd effects are only prevalent in the presence
of hyperfine interactions. We formulate the hyperfine-induced
time-reversal-symmetry breaking S-PS nucleon-electron interaction in general
atoms in a mixed perturbative and variational approach, based on electronic
Dirac-wavefunctions including the effects of electron correlations. The method
is applied to the Hg atom, yielding the first direct calculation of the

results in additionally improved model-independent limits for both the electron

source in the centre of galaxy clusters, it is still unclear how the feedback
energy is injected into the intracluster medium (ICM) and what role different
numerical approaches play. Here, we compare four hydrodynamical schemes in
idealized simulations of a rising bubble inflated by AGN feedback in a hot
stratified ICM: (traditional) smoothed particle hydrodynamics (TSPH), a
pressure flavour of SPH (PSPH), a meshless finite mass (MFM) scheme, as well as
an Eulerian code with adaptive mesh refinement. In the absence of magnetic
fields, the bubble is Kelvin-Helmholtz unstable on short enough time scales to
dissolve it fully in the ICM, which is captured by MFM and RAMSES simulations,
while in the TSPH simulation the bubble survives. When the ICM is turbulent,
mixing of the bubble with the ICM is accelerated. This occurs if the numerical
scheme can capture the instabilities well. The differences in the evolution of
the bubble has a surprisingly small influence on the thermal structure of the
ICM. However, in the simulations with MFM and RAMSES the bubble disruption
leads to turbulent stirring of the ICM which is suppressed in SPH. In the
latter the thermal energy remains trapped in the bubble and is transported to
large radii. We discuss if the choice of hydrodynamical schemes can lead to
systematic differences in the outcomes of cosmological simulations.

complimentary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) and average data rate of
the normalized SNR-based scheduling in an uplink cellular network using
stochastic geometry. The uplink analysis is essentially different from the
downlink analysis in that the per-user transmit power control is performed and
that the interferers are composed of at most one transmitting user in each cell
other than the target cell. In addition, as the effect of multi-user diversity
varies from cell to cell depending on the number of users involved in the
scheduling, the distribution of the number of users is required to obtain the
averaged performance of the scheduling. This paper derives the SINR CCDF
relative to the typical scheduled user by focusing on two incompatible cases,
where the scheduler selects a user from all the users in the corresponding
Voronoi cell or does not select users near cell edges. In each case, the SINR
CCDF is marginalized over the distribution of the number of users involved in
the scheduling, which is asymptotically correct if the BS density is
sufficiently large or small. Through the simulations, the accuracies of the
analytical results are validated for both cases, and the scheduling gains are
evaluated to confirm the multi-user diversity gain.

The length (respectively, depth) of $G$ is the maximal (respectively, minimal)
length of such a chain. We studied the depth of finite simple groups in a
previous paper, which included a classification of the simple groups of depth
$3$. Here we go much further by determining the finite groups of depth $3$ and
$4$. We also obtain several new results on the lengths of finite groups. For
example, we classify the simple groups of length at most $9$, which extends
earlier work of Janko and Harada from the 1960s, and we use this to describe
the structure of arbitrary finite groups of small length. We also present a
number-theoretic result of Heath-Brown, which implies that there are infinitely
many non-abelian simple groups of length at most $9$.
  Finally we study the chain difference of $G$ (namely the length minus the
depth). We obtain results on groups with chain difference $1$ and $2$,
including a complete classification of the simple groups with chain difference
$2$, extending earlier work of Brewster et al. We also derive a best possible
lower bound on the chain ratio (the length divided by the depth) of simple
groups, which yields an explicit linear bound on the length of $G/R(G)$ in
terms of the chain difference of $G$, where $R(G)$ is the soluble radical of

diffusion processes with random jumps and vanishing diffusion terms, where the
random jumps are introduced in order to modify the evolution of the controlled
diffusions by switching from one mode of dynamics to another. That is,
depending on the state-position and state-transition information, the dynamics
of the controlled diffusions randomly switches between the different drift and
diffusion terms. Here, we specifically investigate the asymptotic exit problem
concerning such controlled Markov diffusion processes in two steps: (i) First,
for each controlled diffusion model, we look for an admissible Markov control
process that minimizes the principal eigenvalue for the corresponding
infinitesimal generator with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions -- where such
an admissible control process also forces the controlled diffusion process to
remain in a given bounded open domain for a longer duration. (ii) Then, using
large deviations theory, we determine the exit place and the type of
distribution at the exit time for the controlled Markov diffusion processes
coupled with random jumps and vanishing diffusion terms. Moreover, the
asymptotic results at the exit time also allow us to determine the limiting
behavior of the Dirichlet problem for the corresponding system of elliptic
partial differential equations containing a small vanishing parameter.

concerning the spectrum of trapped gravitons in a spherical box, and in
particular inside a Schwarzschild black hole (BH). We explore the possibility
that, due to finite size effects, the frequency of the radiation made of
trapped gravitons can be modified in such a way that a linear equation of state
$PV=\gamma U$ for the pressure $P$ and the internal energy $U$ arises. Firstly,
we study the case with $U\sim R$, where only fluids with $\gamma >-\frac{1}{3}$
are possible. If corrections $\sim 1/R$ are added to $U$, for
$\gamma\in[0,\frac{1}{3}]$ we found no limitation on the allowed value for the
areal radius of the trapped sphere $R$. Moreover, for $\gamma>\frac{1}{3}$ we
have a minimum allowed value for $R$ of the order of the Planck length $L_P$.
Conversely, a fluid with $P<0$ can be obtained but with a maximum allowed value
for $R$. With the added term looking like $\sim 1/R$ to the BH internal energy
$U$, the well known logarithmic corrections to the BH entropy naturally emerge
for any linear equation of state. The results of this paper suggest that finite
size effects could modify the structure of graviton's radiation inside, showing
a possible mechanism to transform radiation into dark energy.

is not secure even if 50% of total mining power is held by altruistic miners.
Since then, researchers have been investigating either to improve the
efficiency of selfish mining, or how to defend against it, typically in a
single selfish miner setting. Yet there is no research on a selfish mining
strategies concurrently used by multiple miners in the system. The
effectiveness of such selfish mining strategies and their required mining power
under such multiple selfish miners setting remains unknown.
  In this paper, a preliminary investigation and our findings of selfish mining
strategy used by multiple miners are reported. In addition, the conventional
model of Bitcoin system is slightly redesigned to tackle its shortcoming:
namely, a concurrency of individual mining processes. Although a theoretical
analysis of selfish mining strategy under this setting is yet to be
established, the current findings based on simulations is promising and of
great interest. In particular, our work shows that a lower bound of power
threshold required for selfish mining strategy decreases in proportion to a
number of selfish miners. Moreover, there exist Nash equilibria where all
selfish miners in the system do not change to an honest mining strategy and
simultaneously earn their unfair amount of mining reward given that they
equally possess sufficiently large mining power. Lastly, our new model yields a
power threshold for mounting selfish mining strategy slightly greater than one
from the conventional model.

studied using the concurrent spin injection of a spin-polarized tunneling
current and a spin Hall current exciting the free layer into dynamic regimes
beyond what is achieved by each individual mechanism. The pure spin injection
is capable of inducing oscillations in the absence of charge currents
effectively reducing the critical tunneling current to zero. This reduction of
the critical charge currents can improve the endurance of both STNOs and
non-volatile magnetic memories (MRAM) devices. It is shown that the system
response can be described in terms of an injected spin current density $J_s$
which results from the contribution of both spin injection mechanisms, with the
tunneling current polarization $p$ and the spin Hall angle $\theta$ acting as
key parameters determining the efficiency of each injection mechanism. The
experimental data exhibits an excellent agreement with this model which can be
used to quantitatively predict the critical points ($J_s = -2.26\pm 0.09 \times

Configurations (SSC) formalism was introduced. The scheme combines quantum
field theory on a background space-time, semiclassical treatment of gravitation
and spontaneous collapse theories. The approach is applied to the context of
early universe cosmology using a formal description of the transition from an
initial inflationary stage characterized by a spatially homogeneous and
isotropic (H&I) universe, to another where inhomogeneities are present in
association with quantum fluctuations of the field driving inflation. In that
work two constructions are produced. One of them describes a universe that is
completely spatially (H&I), and the other is characterized by a slight
excitation of the particular inhomogeneous and anisotropic perturbation.
Finally, a characterization of their gluing to each other is provided as
representing the transition as a result from a spontaneous collapse of the
state of the quantum field, following the hypothesis originally introduced in
[2].
  Specifically, in [1] this construction is carried out by using cosmological
perturbation theory and working up to linear order in the perturbation.
However, given the nonlinear nature of gravitation, we should in principle
explore the application of the formalism in a nonlinear regime. To this end and
as a first step, we study in this work the transition from a spatially (H&I),
from a SSC-I to one SSC-II that is not spatially (H&I), working this time up to
second order in perturbation theory. We find that the self consistent
construction now requires consideration of the so called tensor modes, as well
as a nontrivial mixing of modes that made the analysis much more difficult and
which could not a priori be warranted to work out in detail. The present work
shows that this is indeed the case.

redshift range of $0 < z < 6$, we find a typical error of $\Delta z = 0.03 *

is a powerful greenhouse gas that may prevent the habitability of inner planets
while enabling the habitability of outer ones (refs 6-8). An atmosphere largely
dominated by hydrogen, if cloud-free, should yield prominent spectroscopic
signatures in the near-infrared detectable during transits. Observations of the
innermost planets have ruled out such signatures (ref 9). However, the
outermost planets are more likely to have sustained such a Neptune-like
atmosphere (refs 10,11). Here, we report observations for the four planets
within or near the system's habitable zone, the circumstellar region where
liquid water could exist on a planetary surface (refs 12-14). These planets do
not exhibit prominent spectroscopic signatures at near-infrared wavelengths

difficulty, some problem-specific algorithms have been developed in the

gap: we propose a general algorithm for high-dimensional missing data problems.
The proposed algorithm works by iterating between an imputation step and a
consistency step. At the imputation step, the missing data are imputed
conditional on the observed data and the current estimate of parameters; and at
the consistency step, a consistent estimate is found for the minimizer of a
Kullback-Leibler divergence defined on the pseudo-complete data. For high
dimensional problems, the consistent estimate can be found under sparsity
constraints. The consistency of the averaged estimate for the true parameter
can be established under quite general conditions. The proposed algorithm is
illustrated using high-dimensional Gaussian graphical models, high-dimensional
variable selection, and a random coefficient model.

luminosity depends on the amount of radioactive ${}^{56}\textrm{Co}$. The ratio
of odd-numbered to even-numbered isotopes depends significantly on the density
of the progenitor white dwarf during the SN explosion, which, in turn, depends
on the details of the progenitor system at the time of ignition. From a
comprehensive analysis of the entire light curve of SN 2013aa, we measure a
$M({}^{57}\textrm{Co})/M({}^{56}\textrm{Co})$ ratio of $0.02^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$,
which indicates a relatively low central density for the progenitor white dwarf
at the time of explosion, consistent with double-degenerate progenitor
channels. We estimate $M({}^{56}\textrm{Ni}) = 0.732 \pm
0.151\:\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, and place an upper limit on the abundance of
${}^{55}\textrm{Fe}$. A recent study reported a possible correlation between

influential billboard placement: given a set of billboards $U$ (each with a
location and a cost), a database of trajectories $\mathcal{T}$ and a budget
$L$, find a set of billboards within the budget to influence the largest number
of trajectories. One core challenge is to identify and reduce the overlap of
the influence from different billboards to the same trajectories, while keeping
the budget constraint into consideration. We show that this problem is NP-hard
and present an enumeration based algorithm with $(1-1/e)$ approximation ratio.
However, the enumeration should be very costly when $|U|$ is large. By
exploiting the locality property of billboards' influence, we propose a
partition-based framework PartSel. PartSel partitions $U$ into a set of small
clusters, computes the locally influential billboards for each cluster, and
merges them to generate the global solution. Since the local solutions can be
obtained much more efficient than the global one, PartSel should reduce the
computation cost greatly; meanwhile it achieves a non-trivial approximation
ratio guarantee. Then we propose a LazyProbe method to further prune billboards
with low marginal influence, while achieving the same approximation ratio as
PartSel. Experiments on real datasets verify the efficiency and effectiveness
of our methods.

astrophysical environments. In most situations, these processes do not occur in
isolation, but interact with each other. This renders a comprehensive theory of
these processes highly challenging. Here, we propose a theory of
magnetohydrodynamic turbulence driven at large scale that self-consistently
accounts for the mutual interplay with magnetic reconnection occurring at
smaller scales. Magnetic reconnection produces plasmoids that grow from
turbulence-generated noise and eventually disrupt the sheet-like structures in
which they are born. The disruption of these structures leads to a modification
of the turbulent energy cascade, which, in turn, exerts a feedback effect on
the plasmoid formation via the turbulence-generated noise. The energy spectrum
in this plasmoid-mediated range steepens relative to the standard inertial
range and does not follow a simple power law. As a result of the complex
interplay between turbulence and reconnection, we also find that the length
scale which marks the beginning of the plasmoid-mediated range and the
dissipation length scale do not obey true power laws. The transitional magnetic
Reynolds number above which the plasmoid formation becomes statistically
significant enough to affect the turbulent cascade is fairly modest, implying
that plasmoids are expected to modify the turbulent path to dissipation in many
astrophysical systems.

deformation and damage phenomena occurring at the micro-scale of
polycrystalline materials is presented.
  Micro-mechanics studies are commonly performed using the Finite Element
Method (FEM) for its versatility and robustness. However, finite element
formulations usually lead to an extremely high number of degrees of freedom of
the considered micro-structures, thus making alternative formulations of great
engineering interest. Among the others, the Boundary Element Method (BEM)
represents a viable alternative to FEM approaches as it allows to express the
problem in terms of boundary values only, thus reducing the total number of
degrees of freedom.
  The computational framework developed in this thesis is based on a non-linear
multi-domain BEM approach for generally anisotropic materials and is devoted to
the analysis of three-dimensional polycrystalline microstructures. Different
theoretical and numerical aspects of the polycrystalline problem using the
boundary element method are investigated: first, being the formulation based on
a integral representation of the governing equations, a novel and more compact
expression of the integration kernels capable of representing the multi-field
behaviour of generally anisotropic materials is presented; second, the sources
of the high computational cost of polycrystalline analyses are identified and
suitably treated by means of different strategies including an ad-hoc grain
boundary meshing technique developed to tackle the large statistical
variability of polycrystalline micro-morphologies; third, non-linear
deformation and failure mechanisms such as inter-granular and trans-granular
cracking and generally anisotropic crystal plasticity are studied and the
numerical results presented throughout the thesis demonstrate the potential of
the developed framework.

phase, are key to copper-based high temperature superconductivity (HTS). By

But this distinction may be deceptive because Fe has five active d-orbitals
while Cu has only one. In theory, such orbital multiplicity can generate a
Hund's Metal state, in which alignment of the Fe spins suppresses inter-orbital
fluctuations producing orbitally selective strong correlations. The spectral
weights $Z_m$ of quasiparticles associated with different Fe orbitals m should
then be radically different. Here we use quasiparticle scattering interference
resolved by orbital content to explore these predictions in FeSe. Signatures of
strong, orbitally selective differences of quasiparticle $Z_m$ appear on all
detectable bands over a wide energy range. Further, the quasiparticle
interference amplitudes reveal that $Z_{xy}<Z_{xz}<<Z_{yz}$, consistent with
earlier orbital-selective Cooper pairing studies. Thus, orbital-selective
strong correlations dominate the parent state of iron-based HTS in FeSe.

unsolved issue resulting in inconsistent usages and endless debates. Currently,
both average reference (AR) and reference electrode standardization technique

framework to resolve this issue by formulating both a) estimation of potentials
at infinity, and, b) determination of the reference, as a unified Bayesian
linear inverse problem. We find that AR and REST are very particular cases of
this unified framework: AR results from biophysically non-informative prior;
while REST utilizes the prior of EEG generative model. We develop the
regularized versions of AR and REST, named rAR, and rREST, respectively. Both
depend on a regularization parameter that is the noise to signal ratio.
Traditional and new estimators are evaluated with this framework, by both
simulations and analysis of real EEGs. Generated artificial EEGs, show that
relative error in estimating the EEG potentials at infinity is lowest for
rREST. It also reveals that realistic volume conductor models improve the
performances of REST and rREST. For practical applications, it is shown that
average lead field gives the results comparable to the individual lead field.
Finally, it is shown that the selection of the regularization parameter with
Generalized Cross-Validation (GCV) is close to the 'oracle' choice based on the
ground truth. When evaluated with the real 89 resting state EEGs, rREST
consistently yields the lowest GCV. This study provides a novel perspective on
the EEG reference problem by means of a unified inverse solution framework. It
may allow additional principled theoretical formulations and numerical
evaluation of performance.

step, where map-information about the environment is gathered; and an
exploitation step, where this information is used to navigate efficiently. Deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, alternatively, approach the problem of
navigation in an end-to-end fashion. Inspired by the classical approach, we ask
whether DRL algorithms are able to inherently explore, gather and exploit
map-information over the course of navigation. We build upon Mirowski et al.
[2017] work and introduce a systematic suite of experiments that vary three
parameters: the agent's starting location, the agent's target location, and the
maze structure. We choose evaluation metrics that explicitly measure the
algorithm's ability to gather and exploit map-information. Our experiments show
that when trained and tested on the same maps, the algorithm successfully
gathers and exploits map-information. However, when trained and tested on
different sets of maps, the algorithm fails to transfer the ability to gather
and exploit map-information to unseen maps. Furthermore, we find that when the
goal location is randomized and the map is kept static, the algorithm is able
to gather and exploit map-information but the exploitation is far from optimal.
We open-source our experimental suite in the hopes that it serves as a
framework for the comparison of future algorithms and leads to the discovery of
robust alternatives to classical navigation methods.

high-symmetry points in the irreducible Brillouin zone with a small
electron-pocket compensation. First-principles calculations demonstrate that
while one of the cones is insensitive to lattice expansion, the second cone

are highly desirable for MHD, but the rigorous positivity-preserving (PP)

complexity of the MHD equations as well as the indeterminate relation between
the PP property and the divergence-free condition on magnetic field. We present
the first rigorous PP analysis of conservative schemes with Lax-Friedrichs (LF)
flux for ideal MHD. The significant innovation is the discovery of theoretical
connection between PP property and a discrete divergence-free (DDF) condition.
This connection is established through the generalized LF splitting properties,
which are alternatives of the usually-expected LF splitting property that does
not hold for ideal MHD. The generalized LF splitting properties involve a
number of admissible states strongly coupled by DDF condition, making their
derivation very difficult. We derive these properties via a novel equivalent
form of the admissible state set and an important inequality skillfully
constructed by technical estimates. Rigorous PP analysis is presented for
finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin schemes with LF flux on uniform
Cartesian meshes. In 1D case, PP property is proved for the first-order scheme
with proper numerical viscosity, and also for arbitrarily high-order schemes
under conditions accessible by a PP limiter. In 2D case, we show that the DDF
condition is necessary and crucial for achieving PP property. It is observed
that even slightly violating the proposed DDF condition may cause failure to
preserve the positivity of pressure. We prove that the 2D LF type scheme with
proper numerical viscosity preserves the positivity and DDF condition.
Sufficient conditions are derived for 2D PP high-order schemes, and extension
to 3D is discussed. Numerical examples confirm the theoretical findings.

complex characteristics, allied with often observed great parameter variation,
remain a challenge for discrete and integrated electronics. Much of transistor
research and applications have relied on transistor models, as well as
respective equivalent circuits, to be employed for circuit analysis and
simulations. Here, a simple and yet accurate transistor equivalent circuit is
derived, based on the Early effect, which involves only the voltage $V_a$ and a
companion parameter $s$. Equations are obtained for currents and voltages in a
common-emitter circuit, allowing the derivation of respective gain functions.
These functions are found to exhibit interesting mathematical structure, with
gain values varying almost linearly with the base current, allowing the gains
to be well characterized in terms of their average and variation values. These
results are applied to deriving a prototypic Early space summarizing the
characteristics of transistors, enriched with recently experimentally obtained
prototypes of NPN and PNP silicon BJTs and alloy germanium transistors. Though
a trade-off between gain and linearity is revealed, a band characterized by
small values of $V_a$ stands out when aiming at both high gain and low
distortion. The Early equivalent model was used also for studying the stability
of circuits under voltage supply oscillations, as well as parallel combinations
of transistors. In the former case, it was verified that more traditional
approaches assuming constant current gain can yield stability factors that
deviate substantially from those derived for the more accurate Early approach.
The equivalent circuit obtained for parallel combinations of transistors was
shown also to closely follow the Early formulation.

the usual chiral $d$-wave edge states, there also exist electron-like edge

algorithms is to maintain the quantum adiabaticity during the entire evolution.
However, the energy gap between the ground and the excited states of
interacting many-body systems often decreases quickly with the number of
qubits, and the quantum adiabaticity can be severely impaired. Despite numerous
previous efforts, a practical method to preserve the quantum adiabaticity has
yet to be developed. Here we present a universal approach to enhancing the
quantum adiabaticity via cavity or circuit QED. By coupling an adiabatic
quantum computer to an ancilla cavity, the coupled system can exhibit a
bistable regime with bifurcation points, where the time evolution becomes very
slow. Utilizing these generic nonlinear features, we show that the energy gap
of the adiabatic quantum computer can be positioned between the bifurcation
points, which results in strongly-enhanced quantum adiabaticity. We then apply
this method to a quantum two-level system, an Exact Cover problem, and a
transverse field Ising model. In contrast to previous works, this approach does
not require the spectral knowledge of the quantum system or the construction of
unphysical interactions and can be applied to a vast variety of adiabatic

the discrepancy between short-time two-particle dispersion forward and backward
in time. These results are facilitated by a rigorous version of the
Ott-Mann-Gaw\c{e}dzki relation, sometimes described as a ""Lagrangian analogue
of the 4/5ths law"". In particular, we prove that for any space-time $L^3$ weak
solution of the Euler equations, the Lagrangian forward/backward dispersion
measure matches on to the energy defect in the sense of distributions. For
strong limits of $d\geq3$ dimensional Navier-Stokes solutions the defect
distribution coincides with the viscous dissipation anomaly. The Lagrangian
formula shows that particles released into a $3d$ turbulent flow will initially
disperse faster backward-in-time than forward, in agreement with recent
theoretical predictions of Jucha et. al (2014). In two dimensions, we consider
strong limits of solutions of the forced Euler equations with increasingly
high-wavenumber forcing as a model of an ideal inverse cascade regime. We show
that the same Lagrangian dispersion measure matches onto the anomalous input
from the infinite-frequency force. As forcing typically acts as an energy
source, this leads to the prediction that particles in $2d$ typically disperse
faster forward in time than backward, which is opposite to what occurs in $3d$.
Time-asymmetry of the Lagrangian dispersion is thereby closely tied to the
direction of the turbulent cascade, downscale in $d\geq 3$ and upscale in
$d=2$. These conclusions lend support to the conjecture of Eyink & Drivas
(2015) that a similar connection holds for time-asymmetry of Richardson
two-particle dispersion and cascade direction, albeit at longer times.

Using linear stability theory, magnetic field is estimated as 21-40 mG to
suppress growth of MRT in the observed finger structures. In the southward
plasma segment, a horn-like structure is observed at 11:55 UT in the
intermediate corona that also indicates MRT instability. Falling blobs are also
observed in both the plasma segments. In the outer corona upto 6-13 solar
radii, the mushroom-like plasma structures have been identified in the upper
northward MRT unstable plasma segment using STEREO-A/COR-2. These structures
most likely grew due to the breaking and twisting of fingers at large spatial
scales in weaker magnetic fields. In the lower inter-planetary space upto 20
solar radii, these structures are fragmented into various small-scale localized
plasma spikes most likely due to turbulent mixing.

  In this paper, we propose DeepRoad, an unsupervised framework to
automatically generate large amounts of accurate driving scenes to test the

particular, DeepRoad delivers driving scenes with various weather conditions

including those with very high Tc.The superconductivity in sulfur hydrides with
record value (203 K) is caused by the phonon mechanism. However, the picture
differs from the conventional one in important ways. The phonon spectrum in
sulfur hydride is both broad and has a complex structure. High value of Tc is
mainly due to strong coupling to the high-frequency optical modes, although the
acoustic phonons also make a noticeable contribution. New approach is
described;it generalizes the standard treatment of the phonon mechanism and
makes it possible to obtain an analytical expression for Tc . It turns out
that, unlike in the conventional case, the value of the isotope coefficient
varies with the pressure and reflects the impact of the optical modes. The
phase diagram, that is the pressure dependence of Tc, is rather peculiar. A
crucial feature is that increasing pressure results in a series of structural
transitions, including the one, which yields the superconducting phase with the
record Tc.In a narrow region near 150GPa the critical temperature rises sharply
from 120K to 200K. The sharp structural transition, which produces the high Tc
phase, is a first-order phase transition caused by interaction between the
order parameter and lattice deformations.Remarkable feature of the electronic
spectrum in the high Tc phase is the appearance of small pockets at the Fermi
level. Their presence leads to a two-gap spectrum, which can, in principle, be
observed, with the future use of tunneling spectroscopy. This feature leads to
non-monotonic and strongly asymmetric pressure dependence of Tc. Other hydrides
can be expected to display even higher values of Tc, up to room temperature.
The fundamental challenge lays in creation a structure capable of displaying
high Tc at ambient pressure.

premelting temperatures reduce linearly with the increase of specific surface
area. The collapse mechanisms are different for np-Cu with different specific
surface area. If the specific surface area less than a critical value ($\sim$
2.38 nm$^{-1}$), direct surface premelting, giving rise to the transition of
ligaments from solid to liquid states, is the cause to facilitate falling-down
of np-Cu during thermal annealing. While surface premelting and following
recrystallization, accelerating the sloughing of ligaments and annihilation of

parameters that need to be estimated. The framework does not require the
analyst to specify the shape of the distribution prior to model estimation, but
can approximate any multivariate probability distribution function to any
arbitrary degree of accuracy. The grid with unequal intervals, in particular,
offers greater flexibility than existing multivariate nonparametric
specifications, while requiring the estimation of a small number of additional
parameters. An expectation maximization algorithm is developed for the
estimation of these models. Multiple synthetic datasets and a case study on
travel mode choice behavior are used to demonstrate the value of the model

random taste heterogeneity through continuous mixture distributions, the

whether the optical field in the image plane is generated by one incoherent
on-axis source with brightness $\epsilon$ or by two $\epsilon/2$-brightness

Using the exact thermal-state model of the field, we derive the quantum
Chernoff bound for the detection problem, which specifies the optimum rate of
decay of the error probability with increasing number of collected photons that
is allowed by quantum mechanics. We then show that recently proposed
linear-optic schemes approach the quantum Chernoff bound---the method of binary
spatial-mode demultiplexing (B-SPADE) is quantum-optimal for all values of
separation, while a method using image-inversion interferometry (SLIVER) is
near-optimal for sub-Rayleigh separations. We then simplify our model using a
low-brightness approximation that is very accurate for optical microscopy and
astronomy, derive quantum Chernoff bounds conditional on the number of photons
detected, and show the optimality of our schemes in this conditional detection
paradigm. For comparison, we analytically demonstrate the superior scaling of
the Chernoff bound for our schemes with source separation relative to that of
spatially-resolved direct imaging. Our schemes have the advantages over the
quantum-optimal (Helstrom) measurement in that they do not involve joint
measurements over multiple modes, and that they do not require the angular
separation for the two-source hypothesis to be given \emph{a priori} and can
offer that information as a bonus in the event of a successful detection.

mock-up of a graphical user interface (GUI) into code. This process takes place
both at an application's inception and in an evolutionary context as GUI
changes keep pace with evolving features. Unfortunately, this practice is
challenging and time-consuming. In this paper, we present an approach that
automates this process by enabling accurate prototyping of GUIs via three
tasks: detection, classification, and assembly. First, logical components of a
GUI are detected from a mock-up artifact using either computer vision
techniques or mock-up metadata. Then, software repository mining, automated
dynamic analysis, and deep convolutional neural networks are utilized to
accurately classify GUI-components into domain-specific types (e.g.,
toggle-button). Finally, a data-driven, K-nearest-neighbors algorithm generates
a suitable hierarchical GUI structure from which a prototype application can be
automatically assembled. We implemented this approach for Android in a system
called ReDraw. Our evaluation illustrates that ReDraw achieves an average
GUI-component classification accuracy of 91% and assembles prototype
applications that closely mirror target mock-ups in terms of visual affinity
while exhibiting reasonable code structure. Interviews with industrial
practitioners illustrate ReDraw's potential to improve real development
workflows.

Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The deformation
of such a huge spherically shaped reflector into different transient parabolic

of the 2225 nodes through the connected down tied cables. For each different
tracking process of the telescope, more than 1/3 of these 2225 actuators must
be in operation to tune the parabolic aperture accurately to meet the surface
error restriction. It means that some of these actuators are inevitably located
within the main beam of the receiver, and the Electromagnetic Interference
(EMI) from the actuators must be mitigated to ensure the scientific output of
the telescope. Based on the threshold level of interference detrimental to
radio astronomy presented in ITU-R Recommendation RA.769 and EMI measurements,
the shielding efficiency (SE) requirement of each actuator is set to be 80dB in
the frequency range from 70MHz to 3GHz. Therefore, Electromagnetic

such as power line filters, optical fibers, shielding enclosures and other
structural measures. In 2015, all the actuators had been installed at the FAST

with charge conservation. In particular, we consider models with $N$ flavors of
fermions and $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^N$ symmetry, associated with the conservation of
the fermionic parity of each flavor. For a single flavor, we recover the result
that a distinct topological phase with exponentially localized zero modes does
not exist due to absence of a gap to single particles in the bulk. For $N>1$,
however, we show that the ends of the system can host low-energy,
exponentially-localized modes. The analysis can readily be generalized to
systems in other symmetry classes. To illustrate these ideas, we focus on
lattice models with $SO\left(N\right)$ symmetric interactions, and study the
phase transition between the trivial and the topological gapless phases using
bosonization and a weak-coupling renormalization group analysis. As a concrete
example, we study in detail the case of $N=3$. We show that in this case, the
topologically non-trivial superconducting phase corresponds to a gapless
analogue of the Haldane phase in spin-1 chains. In this phase, although the
bulk is gapless to single particle excitations, the ends host spin-$1/2$
degrees of freedom which are exponentially localized and protected by the spin
gap in the bulk. We obtain the full phase diagram of the model numerically,
using density matrix renormalization group calculations. Within this model, we
identify the self-dual line studied by Andrei and Destri [Nucl. Phys. B,
231(3), 445-480 (1984)], as a first-order transition line between the gapless
Haldane phase and a trivial gapless phase. This allows us to identify the

(Max-IP), in which we are given sets $A$ and $B$ of vectors, and the goal is to
find $a \in A$ and $b \in B$ maximizing inner product $a \cdot b$. Max-IP is
very basic and serves as the base problem in the recent breakthrough of [Abboud
et al., FOCS 2017] on hardness of approximation for polynomial-time problems.
It is also used (implicitly) in the argument for hardness of exact
$\ell_2$-Furthest Pair (and other important problems in computational geometry)
in poly-log-log dimensions in [Williams, SODA 2018]. We have three main results
regarding this problem.
  First, we study the best multiplicative approximation ratio for Boolean
Max-IP in sub-quadratic time. We show that, for Max-IP with two sets of $n$
vectors from $\{0,1\}^{d}$, there is an $n^{2 - \Omega(1)}$ time $\left( d/\log
n \right)^{\Omega(1)}$-multiplicative-approximating algorithm, and we show this
is conditionally optimal, as such a $\left(d/\log
n\right)^{o(1)}$-approximating algorithm would refute SETH.
  Second, we achieve a similar characterization for the best additive
approximation error to Boolean Max-IP. We show that, for Max-IP with two sets
of $n$ vectors from $\{0,1\}^{d}$, there is an $n^{2 - \Omega(1)}$ time
$\Omega(d)$-additive-approximating algorithm, and this is conditionally
optimal, as such an $o(d)$-approximating algorithm would refute SETH
[Rubinstein, STOC 2018].
  Last, we revisit the hardness of solving Max-IP exactly for vectors with
integer entries. We show that, under SETH, for Max-IP with sets of $n$ vectors
from $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ for some $d = 2^{O(\log^{*} n)}$, every exact algorithm
requires $n^{2 - o(1)}$ time. With the reduction from [Williams, SODA 2018], it
follows that $\ell_2$-Furthest Pair and Bichromatic $\ell_2$-Closest Pair in
$2^{O(\log^{*} n)}$ dimensions require $n^{2 - o(1)}$ time.

the 4D-Var formulation leads to a large-scale optimization problem for every

various reduced order approaches have therefore been proposed in the recent
past. Here, we employ the reduced basis method to generate reduced order
approximations for the state, adjoint, initial condition, and model error. Our

the huge literature on the subject is hard to overlook. In many applications,
the nanoparticles must be affixed to a colloidal carrier for easy handling
during catalysis. These ""passive carriers"" (e.g., dendrimers) serve for a
controlled synthesis of the nanoparticles and prevent coagulation during
catalysis. Recently, hybrids from nanoparticles and polymers have been
developed that allow us to change the catalytic activity of the nanoparticles
by external triggers. In particular, single nanoparticles embedded in a
thermosensitive network made from poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) have
become the most-studied examples of such hybrids: Immersed in cold water, the
PNIPAM network is hydrophilic and fully swollen. In this state, hydrophilic
substrates can diffuse easily through the network, and react at the surface of
the nanoparticles. Above the volume transition located at 32{\deg}C, the
network becomes hydrophobic and shrinks. Now hydrophobic substrates will
preferably diffuse through the network and react with other substrates in the
reaction catalyzed by the enclosed nanoparticle. Such ""active carriers"", may
thus be viewed as true nanoreactors that open new ways for the use of
nanoparticles in catalysis.

the well-formedness condition imposed on a quantum Turing machine model as well
as of the uniformity condition necessary for a quantum circuit model. Our new
approach can further open a door to the descriptional complexity of quantum

winds having possibly contributed to the expulsion of the $\alpha$-elements,

already enriched in the products of type Ia supernovae. The majority of
clusters appear also under-abundant in CN compared to Milky Way halo globular
clusters, perhaps because of the lack of a conspicuous N-enriched,

investigate their structural, mechanical and electronic properties. The results
show that stability of PNRs strongly depends on the direction along which they
can be cut from 2D counterpart. PNRs also exhibit a wide range of line
stiffness ranging from 6x10^10 eV/m to 18x10^11 eV/m which has little
dependence on the edge passivation. Likewise, the calculated electronic
properties of PNRs display them to be either narrow-gap semiconductor (Eg < 1
eV) or wide-gap semiconductor (Eg > 1 eV). The carrier mobility of PNRs is
found to be comparable to that of the black phosphorene. Some of the PNRs show
n-type (p-type) semiconducting character owing to their higher electron (hole)
mobility. Passivation of the edges leads to n-type <-> p-type transition in

fluid, which depends on a variety of governing parameters such as the initial
density, $\Delta \rho$, the total initial height of the fluid, $H$, and the
slope of the terrain, $\alpha$, from where it is released. Depending on these
parameters, the gravity current may be designated as sub-critical, critical, or
super-critical. It is imperative to study the entrainment dynamics of a gravity
current in order to have a clear understanding of mixing transitions that
govern the flow physics, the shear layer thickness, $\delta_{u}$, and the
mixing layer thickness, $\delta_{\rho}$. Experiments were conducted in a
lock-exchange facility in which the dense fluid was separated from the ambient
lighter fluid using a gate. As the gate is released instantaneously, an energy
conserving gravity current is formed, for which the only governing parameter is
the Reynolds number defined as $Re=\frac{Uh}{\nu}$, where $U$ is the front
velocity of the gravity current, and $h$ is the height of the current. In our
study, the bulk Richardson number, $Ri_{b}$=$\frac{g^{'}H}{U_{b}^{2}}$=1, takes
a constant value for all the experiments, with $U_{b}$ being the bulk velocity
of the layer defined as $U_{b}$=$\sqrt{g^{'}H}$. Simultaneous Particle Image
Velocimetry (PIV) and Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) measurement
techniques are employed to get the velocity and density statistics. A
flux-based method is used to calculate the entrainment coefficient, E$_{F}$,
for a Reynolds number range of $Re\approx$400-13000 used in our experiments.
The result shows a mixing transition at $Re\approx$2700 that is attributed to
the flow transitioning from weak Holmboe waves to Kelvin-Helmholtz type
instabilities.

of space(-time), as well as dynamical picture of quantum mechanics and its
classical approximation, from the relativity symmetry perspective in order to
push further into the realm of the proposed fundamental relativity symmetry
$SO(2,4)$ of our quantum relativity project. We explicitly trace how the
diverse actors in this story change through various contraction limits, paying
careful attention to the relevant physical units, in order to place all known
relativity theories -- quantum and classical -- within a single framework. More
specifically, we explore both of the possible contractions of $SO(2,4)$ and its
coset spaces in order to determine how best to recover the lower-level
theories. These include both new models and all familiar theories, as well as
quantum and classical dynamics with and without Einsteinian special relativity.
Along the way, we also find connections with covariant quantum mechanics. The
emphasis of this article rests on the ability of this language to not only
encompass all known physical theories, but to also provide a path for
extensions. It will serve as the basic background for more detailed
formulations of the dynamical theories at each level, as well as the exact
connections amongst them.

extending the GASS HI scaling relations by one decade in stellar mass, we
quantify total (atomic+molecular) cold gas fractions and molecular-to-atomic
gas mass ratios, $R_{mol}$, for the subset of 477 galaxies observed with the
IRAM 30 m telescope. We find that atomic gas fractions keep increasing with
decreasing stellar mass, with no sign of a plateau down to $\log
M_\star/M_\odot = 9$. Total gas reservoirs remain HI-dominated across our full
stellar mass range, hence total gas fraction scaling relations closely resemble
atomic ones, but with a scatter that strongly correlates with $R_{mol}$,
especially at fixed specific star formation rate. On average, $R_{mol}$ weakly
increases with stellar mass and stellar surface density $\mu_\star$, but
individual values vary by almost two orders of magnitude at fixed $M_\star$ or
$\mu_\star$. We show that, for galaxies on the star-forming sequence,
variations of $R_{mol}$ are mostly driven by changes of the HI reservoirs, with
a clear dependence on $\mu_\star$. Establishing if galaxy mass or structure
plays the most important role in regulating the cold gas content of galaxies
requires an accurate separation of bulge and disk components for the study of
gas scaling relations.

widely present in the living world since they are encountered in
microorganisms, plants and animals. In all organisms PEBPs appear to regulate
important mechanisms that govern cell cycle, proliferation, differentiation and
motility. In humans, three PEBPs have been identified, namely PEBP1, PEBP2 and
PEBP4. PEBP1 and PEBP4 are the most studied as they are implicated in the
development of various cancers. PEBP2 is specific of testes in mammals and was
essentially studied in rats and mice where it is very abundant. A lot of
information has been gained on PEBP1 also named RKIP (Raf Kinase Inhibitory
protein) due to its role as a metastasis suppressor in cancer. PEBP1 was also
demonstrated to be implicated in Alzheimers disease, diabetes and
nephropathies. Furthermore, PEBP1 was described to be involved in many cellular
processes, among them are signal transduction, inflammation, cell cycle,
proliferation, adhesion, differentiation, apoptosis, autophagy, circadian
rhythm and mitotic spindle checkpoint. On the molecular level, PEBP1 was shown
to regulate several signaling pathways such as Raf/MEK/ERK, NFkB,
PI3K/Akt/mTOR, p38, Notch and Wnt. PEBP1 acts by inhibiting most of the kinases
of these signaling cascades. Moreover, PEBP1 is able to bind to a variety of
small ligands such as ATP, phospholipids, nucleotides, flavonoids or drugs.
Considering PEBP1 is a small cytoplasmic protein (21kDa), its involvement in so
many diseases and cellular mechanisms is amazing. The aim of this review is to
highlight the molecular systems that are common to all these cellular
mechanisms in order to decipher the specific role of PEBP1. Recent discoveries
enable us to propose that PEBP1 is a modulator of molecular interactions that
control signal transduction during membrane and cytoskeleton reorganization.

  We consider three basic data structures, the Acceptance-Rejection method, the
Complete Binary Tree and the Alias method. These can be used as building blocks
in a multi-level data structure, where at each of the levels, one of the basic
data structures can be used, with the top level selecting a group of events,
and the bottom level selecting an element from a group.
  Depending on assumptions on the distribution of the rates of outcomes,
different combinations of the basic structures can be used. We prove that for
particular data structures the expected time of sampling and update is constant
when the rate distribution follows certain conditions. We show that for any
distribution, combining a tree structure with the Acceptance-Rejection method,
we have an expected time of sampling and update of
$O\left(\log\log{r_{max}}/{r_{min}}\right)$ is possible, where $r_{max}$ is the
maximum rate and $r_{min}$ the minimum rate. We also discuss an implementation
of a Two Levels Acceptance-Rejection data structure, that allows expected
constant time for sampling, and amortized constant time for updates, assuming
that $r_{max}$ and $r_{min}$ are known and the number of events is sufficiently
large.

is a generalization of branchings serving as a counterpart of $b$-matchings.
Here $b$ is a positive integer vector on the vertex set of a digraph, and a
$b$-branching is defined as a common independent set of two matroids defined by
$b$: an arc set is a $b$-branching if it has at most $b(v)$ arcs sharing the
terminal vertex $v$, and it is an independent set of a certain sparsity matroid
defined by $b$. We demonstrate that $b$-branchings yield an appropriate
generalization of branchings by extending several classical results on
branchings. We first present a multi-phase greedy algorithm for finding a
maximum-weight $b$-branching. We then prove a packing theorem extending
Edmonds' disjoint branchings theorem, and provide a strongly polynomial
algorithm for finding optimal disjoint $b$-branchings. As a consequence of the
packing theorem, we prove the integer decomposition property of the
$b$-branching polytope. Finally, we deal with a further generalization in which
a matroid constraint is imposed on the $b(v)$ arcs sharing the terminal vertex
$v$.

conditions at $z=-h$ and $z=0$, respectively, and the periodic lateral boundary
condition. It is shown that this equation is globally, strongly well-posed for
arbitrary large data of the form $a=a_1 + a_2$, where $a_1\in
C(\overline{G};L^p(-h,0))$, $a_2\in L^{\infty}(G;L^p(-h,0))$ for $p>3$, and
where $a_1$ is periodic in the horizontal variables and $a_2$ is sufficiently

The approach relies on $L^\infty_HL^p_z(\Omega)$-estimates for terms of the

then obtained by an iteration scheme, splitting the data into a smooth and a

mean-squared-error (MSE) of estimators that satisfy some unbiasedness
conditions. Although the CCRB unbiasedness conditions are satisfied
asymptotically by the constrained maximum likelihood (CML) estimator, in the
non-asymptotic region these conditions are usually too strict and the
commonly-used estimators, such as the CML estimator, do not satisfy them.
Therefore, the CCRB may not be a lower bound on the MSE matrix of such
estimators. In this paper, we propose a new definition for unbiasedness under
constraints, denoted by C-unbiasedness, which is based on using
Lehmann-unbiasedness with a weighted MSE (WMSE) risk and taking into account
the parametric constraints. In addition to C-unbiasedness, a Cramer-Rao-type
bound on the WMSE of C-unbiased estimators, denoted as Lehmann-unbiased CCRB
(LU-CCRB), is derived. This bound is a scalar bound that depends on the chosen
weighted combination of estimation errors. It is shown that C-unbiasedness is
less restrictive than the CCRB unbiasedness conditions. Thus, the set of
estimators that satisfy the CCRB unbiasedness conditions is a subset of the set
of C-unbiased estimators and the proposed LU-CCRB may be an informative lower
bound in cases where the corresponding CCRB is not. In the simulations, we
examine linear and nonlinear estimation problems under nonlinear constraints in
which the CML estimator is shown to be C-unbiased and the LU-CCRB is an
informative lower bound on the WMSE, while the corresponding CCRB on the WMSE
is not a lower bound and is not informative in the non-asymptotic region.

However, the exact origin of these two phases is unclear. In this paper, depth
dependant analysis results from negative muon implantation experiments are
presented. It is shown that the Pb content is constant throughout all depths
probed in the sample, but the Mg and Nb content changes in the near-surface

there is a 25% increase in Mg content, with a simultaneous 5% decrease in Nb

previously observed skin effects in PMN are due to a change in concentration
and unit cell.

(HR) visual output from the low-resolution (LR) visual inputs overcoming the
physical limitations of the cameras. However, SR has not been applied to
enhance the resolution of spatiotemporal event-stream images captured by the
frame-free dynamic vision sensors (DVSs). SR of event-stream image is
fundamentally different from existing frame-based schemes since basically each
pixel value of DVS images is an event sequence. In this work, a two-stage
scheme is proposed to solve the SR problem of the spatiotemporal event-stream
image. We use a nonhomogeneous Poisson point process to model the event
sequence, and sample the events of each pixel by simulating a nonhomogeneous
Poisson process according to the specified event number and rate function.
Firstly, the event number of each pixel of the HR DVS image is determined with
a sparse signal representation based method to obtain the HR event-count map
from that of the LR DVS recording. The rate function over time line of the
point process of each HR pixel is computed using a spatiotemporal filter on the
corresponding LR neighbor pixels. Secondly, the event sequence of each new
pixel is generated with a thinning based event sampling algorithm. Two metrics
are proposed to assess the event-stream SR results. The proposed method is
demonstrated through obtaining HR event-stream images from a series of DVS
recordings with the proposed method. Results show that the upscaled HR event
streams has perceptually higher spatial texture detail than the LR DVS images.
Besides, the temporal properties of the upscaled HR event streams match that of
the original input very well. This work enables many potential applications of
event-based vision.

proposed which allows a correction term $T_{\alpha\beta}T^{\alpha\beta}$ in the

Gravity (EMSG) and introduces a new coupling parameter $\eta$. EMSG resolves
the big bang singularity and has a viable sequence of cosmological epochs in
its thermal history. {Interestingly, in the vacuum EMSG is equivalent to GR,
and its effects appear only inside the matter-energy distribution. More
specifically, its consequences appear in high curvature regime. Therefore it is
natural to expect deviations form GR inside compact stars. In order to study
spherically symmetric compact stars in EMSG, we find the relativistic governing
equations. More specifically, we find the generalized version of the
Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equation in EMSG. Finally we present two analytical
solutions, and two numerical solutions for the field equations. For obtaining
the numerical solutions we use polytropic equation of state which is widely
used to understand the internal structure of neutron stars in the literature.
Eventually we find a mass-radius relation for neutron stars. Also, We found
that EMSG, depending on the central pressure of the star and the magnitude of
free parameter $\eta$, can lead to larger or smaller masses for neutron stars
compared with GR. Existence of high-mass neutron stars with ordinary polytropic
equation of state in EMSG is important in the sense that these stars exist in
GR provided that one use exotic equation of states.

space and time fluctuations of an evolving one dimensional interface. Its
relevant parameter $u$ is the ratio between the rates of local adsorption and
nonlocal desorption processes (avalanches) processes. The model at $u=1$ give
us the first example of a conformally invariant stochastic model. For small
values $u<u_0$ the model is known to be noncritical, while for $u>u_0$ it is
critical.
  By calculating the structure function of the height profiles in the
reciprocal space we confirm with good precision that indeed $u_0=1$. We
establish that at the conformal invariant point $u=1$ the RPM has a roughness
transition with dynamical and roughness critical exponents $z=1$ and
$\alpha=0$, respectively. For $u>1$ the model is critical with an $u$-dependent
dynamical critical exponent $z(u)$ that tends towards zero as $u\to \infty$.
However at $1/u=0$ the RPM is exactly mapped into the totally asymmetric
exclusion problem (TASEP). This last model is known to be noncritical
(critical) for open (periodic) boundary conditions. Our studies indicate that
the RPM as $u \to \infty$, due to its nonlocal dynamics processes, has the same
large-distance physics no matter what boundary condition we chose. For $u>1$,
our analysis show that differently from previous predictions, the region is
composed by two distinct critical phases. For $u\leq u < u_c\approx 40$ the
height profiles are rough ($\alpha = \alpha(u) >0$), and for $u>u_c$ the height
profiles are flat at large distances ($\alpha = \alpha(u) <0$). We also
observed that in both critical phases ($u>1$) the RPM at short length scales,
has an effective behavior in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) critical
universality class, that is not the true behavior of the system at large length
scales.

mobility, and separate time scales for reproduction and interaction with a

to mimic those that would typically be induced by temporal variation in the
concentration of a drug (antibiotic or chemotherapeutic) as it permeates
through the population and is progressively degraded. Different treatment
regimes, involving single or periodical doses, are evaluated in terms of the
minimal population size (a measure of the extinction probability), and the
population composition (a measure of the selection pressure for resistance or
tolerance during the treatment). We show that there exist timescales over which
the low-stress regime is as effective as the high-stress regime, due to the
competition between the two species. For multiple periodic treatments,
competition can ensure that the minimal population size is attained during the
first pulse when the high-stress regime is short, which implies that a single
short pulse can be more effective than a more protracted regime. Our results
suggest that when the duration of the high-stress environment is restricted, a
treatment with one or multiple shorter pulses can produce better outcomes than
a single long treatment. If ecological competition is to be exploited for
treatments, it is crucial to determine these timescales, and estimate for the
minimal population threshold that suffices for extinction. These parameters can
be quantified by experiment.

Starting from the Fokker-Planck equation, we separate the dynamics into a
convective and a diffusive part. We show that stable and unstable fixed points
of the convective field correspond to maxima and minima of the stationary
probability distribution if the probability current vanishes at these points.
Stochastic phase portraits, which are vector plots of the convective field,
therefore indicate the extrema of the stationary distribution and can be used
to identify stochastic bifurcations that change the number and stability of
these extrema. We show that limit cycles in stochastic phase portraits can
indicate ridges of the probability distribution, and we identify a novel type
of stochastic bifurcations, where the probability maximum moves to the edge of
the system through a gap between the two nullclines of the convective field.

involves, in the early phases, the selection of candidate target asteroids. The
final result of such an analysis is a list of asteroids, ranked with respect to

reach. In this paper we investigate the sensitivity of the produced asteroids
rank to the employed trajectory model in the specific case of a small
low-thrust propelled spacecraft beginning its journey from the Sun-Earth $L_2$

consider five increasingly complex trajectory models: impulsive, Lambert,
nuclear electric propulsion, nuclear electric propulsion including the Earth's
gravity, solar electric propulsion including the Earth's gravity and we study
the final correlation between the obtained target rankings. We find that the
use of a low-thrust trajectory model is of great importance for target
selection, since the use of chemical propulsion surrogates leads to favouring
less attractive options 19\% of times, a percentage that drops to 8\% already
using a simple nuclear electric propulsion model that neglects the Earth's
gravity effects and thrust dependence on the solar distance. We also find that
for the study case considered, a small interplanetary CubeSat named M-ARGO, the
inclusion of the Earth's gravity in the considered dynamics does not affect the
target selection significantly.

in the computation of precise theoretical predictions for the cross sections
measured at the LHC. In recent years, the method of differential equations has
proven to be a powerful tool for the computation of Feynman integrals. It has
been observed that the differential equation of Feynman integrals can in many
instances be transformed into a so-called canonical form, which significantly
simplifies its integration in terms of iterated integrals. The main result of
this thesis is an algorithm to compute rational transformations of differential
equations of Feynman integrals into a canonical form. Apart from requiring the
existence of such a rational transformation, the algorithm needs no further
assumptions about the differential equation. In particular, it is applicable to
problems depending on multiple kinematic variables and also allows for a
rational dependence on the dimensional regulator. First, the transformation law
is expanded in the dimensional regulator to derive differential equations for
the coefficients of the transformation. Using an ansatz in terms of rational
functions, these differential equations are then solved to determine the
transformation. This thesis also presents an implementation of the algorithm in
the Mathematica package CANONICA, which is the first publicly available program
to compute transformations to a canonical form for differential equations
depending on multiple variables. The main functionality and its usage are
illustrated with some simple examples. Furthermore, the package is applied to
state-of-the-art integral topologies appearing in recent multi-loop
calculations. These topologies depend on up to three variables and include
previously unknown topologies contributing to higher-order corrections to the
cross section of single top-quark production at the LHC.

107 sites in the Dongjiang River in two seasons to assess the impact of the
sub-catchments land use structure on the DOM composition. The results showed
that (1) the forested sub-catchments had higher humic-like C1 (16.45%) and C2
(25.04%) and lower protein-like C3 (22.57%) and C4 (35.95%) than urbanized and
mixed forest-agriculture sub-catchments, while the urbanized sub-catchments
showed an inverse trend (4.54%, 15.51%, 33.97% and 45.98%, respectively). (2)
The significant variation in the proportion of C1 and C4 between the dry and
rainy seasons was recorded in both the forested and the mixed
forest-agriculture sub-catchments (p<0.01), but only C4 showed an obvious
seasonal variation in the urbanized sub-catchments (p<0.01). While the DOM
composition was mainly related to the proportion of urbanized land and forested
land year-round (p<0.01), it had stronger correlation with forested land in the
dry season and urbanized land in the rainy season. (3) No significant
correlation between the DOM composition and the agricultural land proportion
was found in either season (p>0.05). Our findings indicated that the DOM
composition was strongly dependent on the land use structure of the
sub-catchments and varied seasonally, but the seasonal variation pattern could
be disturbed by human activities in the extensively urbanized catchments.
Notably, the higher C4 proportion compared with those in temperate rivers
implied a larger amount of CO2 released from the subtropical rivers into the
atmosphere when considering bioavailability.

serious privacy risks. A server offering Recommendation as a Service to a
client might leak more information than necessary regarding its recommendation
model and dataset. At the same time, the disclosure of the client's preferences
to the server is also a matter of concern. Devising privacy-preserving
protocols using general cryptographic primitives (e.g., secure multi-party
computation or homomorphic encryption), is a typical approach to overcome
privacy concerns, but in conjunction with state-of-the-art recommender systems
often yields far-from-practical solutions.
  In this paper, we tackle this problem from the direction of constructing
crypto-friendly machine learning algorithms. In particular, we propose
CryptoRec, a secure two-party computation protocol for Recommendation as a
Service, which encompasses a novel recommender system. This model possesses two
interesting properties: (1) It models user-item interactions in an item-only
latent feature space in which personalized user representations are
automatically captured by an aggregation of pre-learned item features. This
means that a server with a pre-trained model can provide recommendations for a
client whose data is not in its training set. Nevertheless, re-training the
model with the client's data still improves accuracy. (2) It only uses addition
and multiplication operations, making the model straightforwardly compatible
with homomorphic encryption schemes.
  We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of CryptoRec on three real-world
datasets. CryptoRec allows a server with thousands of items to privately answer
a prediction query within a few seconds on a single PC, while its prediction
accuracy is still competitive with state-of-the-art recommender systems
computing over clear data.

through the collapse of oxygen-neon white dwarf (ONe WD) stars in interacting
binaries. We consider (1) non-dynamical mass transfer where an ONe WD
approaches the Chandrasekhar mass leading to accretion-induced collapse (AIC)
and (2) dynamical timescale merger-induced collapse (MIC) between an ONe WD and
another WD. We present rates, delay times, and progenitor properties for two
different treatments of common envelope evolution. We show that AIC neutron
stars are formed via many different channels and the most dominant channel
depends on the adopted common envelope physics. Most AIC and MIC neutron stars
are born shortly after star formation, though some have delay times >10 Gyr.
The shortest delay time (25-50 Myr) AIC neutron stars have stripped-envelope,
compact, helium-burning star donors, though many prompt AIC neutron stars form
via wind-accretion from an asymptotic giant branch star. The longest delay time
AIC neutron stars, which may be observed as young milli-second pulsars among
globular clusters, have a red giant or main sequence donor at the time of NS
formation and will eventually evolve into NS + helium WD binaries. We discuss
AIC & MIC binaries as potential gravitational wave sources for LISA. Neutron
stars created via AIC undergo a LMXB phase, offering an electromagnetic
counterpart for those shortest orbital period sources that LISA could identify.
The formation of neutron stars from interacting WDs in binaries is likely to be
a key mechanism for the production of LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave sources
(NS-NS and BH-NS mergers) in globular clusters.

favours a three-dimensional (3D) spin correlation between the FeO5 bilayers

that the standard accretion disk is truncated and the hot inner region produces
via Comptonization, the hard X-ray flux. This is supported by the value of the
high energy photon index, which is often found to be small $\sim$ 1.7 ($<$ 2)
implying that the hot medium is seed photons starved. On the other hand, the
suggestive presence of a broad relativistic Fe line during the hard state would
suggest that the accretion disk is not truncated but extends all the way to the
inner most stable circle orbit. In such a case, it is a puzzle why the hot
medium would remain photon starved. The broad Fe line should be accompanied by
a broad smeared reflection hump at $\sim$ 30 keV and it may be that this
additional component makes the spectrum hard and the intrinsic photon index is
larger, i.e. $>$ 2. This would mean that the medium is not photon deficient,
reconciling the presence of a broad Fe line in the observed hard state. To test
this hypothesis, we have analyzed the RXTE observations of GX 339-4 from the
four outbursts during 2002-2011 and identify the observations when the system
was in the hard state and showed a broad Fe line. We have then attempted to fit
these observations with models, which include smeared reflection to understand
whether the intrinsic photon index can indeed be large. We find that, while for
some observations the inclusion of reflection does increase the photon index,
there are hard state observations with broad Fe line that have photon indices
less than 2.

This formula is new even in the context of Alexandrov spaces, where second
order differentiation is typically related to semiconvexity.
  We establish this result by showing that $W_2$-geodesics can be approximated
up to second order, in a sense which we shall make precise, by entropic
interpolation. In turn this is achieved by proving new, even in the smooth
setting, estimates concerning entropic interpolations which we believe are
interesting on their own. In particular we obtain:
  - equiboundedness of the densities along the entropic interpolations,
  - local equi-Lipschitz continuity of the Schr\""odinger potentials,
  - a uniform weighted $L^2$ control of the Hessian of such potentials.
  Finally, the techniques adopted in this paper can be used to show that in the
$RCD$ setting the viscous solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation can be
obtained via a vanishing viscosity method, in accordance with the smooth case.
  With respect to a previous version, where the space was assumed to be

high-dimensional datasets. In recent years, several generalizations of MFA have
been developed where the normality assumption of the factors and/or of the
errors was relaxed to allow for skewness in the data. However, due to the form
of the adopted component densities, the distribution of the factors/errors in
most of these models is typically limited to modelling skewness oncentrated in
a single direction. Here, we introduce a more flexible finite mixture of factor
analyzers based on the class of scale mixtures of canonical fundamental skew
normal (SMCFUSN) distributions. This very general class of skew distributions
can capture various types of skewness and asymmetry in the data. In particular,
the proposed mixture model of SMCFUSN factor analyzers(SMCFUSNFA) can
simultaneously accommodate multiple directions of skewness. As such, it
encapsulates many commonly used models as special and/or limiting cases, such
as models of some versions of skew normal and skew t-factor analyzers, and skew
hyperbolic factor analyzers. For illustration, we focus on the t-distribution
member of the class of SMCFUSN distributions, leading to mixtures of canonical
fundamental skew t-factor analyzers (CFUSTFA). Parameter estimation can be
carried out by maximum likelihood via an EM-type algorithm. The usefulness and
potential of the proposed model are demonstrated using two real datasets.

  Network","12 pages, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cross-modal hashing aims to map heterogeneous multimedia data into a common
Hamming space, which can realize fast and flexible retrieval across different
modalities. Supervised cross-modal hashing methods have achieved considerable
progress by incorporating semantic side information. However, they mainly have
two limitations: (1) Heavily rely on large-scale labeled cross-modal training
data which are labor intensive and hard to obtain. (2) Ignore the rich
information contained in the large amount of unlabeled data across different
modalities, especially the margin examples that are easily to be incorrectly
retrieved, which can help to model the correlations. To address these problems,
in this paper we propose a novel Semi-supervised Cross-Modal Hashing approach
by Generative Adversarial Network (SCH-GAN). We aim to take advantage of GAN's
ability for modeling data distributions to promote cross-modal hashing learning
in an adversarial way. The main contributions can be summarized as follows: (1)
We propose a novel generative adversarial network for cross-modal hashing. In
our proposed SCH-GAN, the generative model tries to select margin examples of
one modality from unlabeled data when giving a query of another modality. While
the discriminative model tries to distinguish the selected examples and true
positive examples of the query. These two models play a minimax game so that
the generative model can promote the hashing performance of discriminative
model. (2) We propose a reinforcement learning based algorithm to drive the
training of proposed SCH-GAN. The generative model takes the correlation score
predicted by discriminative model as a reward, and tries to select the examples
close to the margin to promote discriminative model by maximizing the margin
between positive and negative data. Experiments on 3 widely-used datasets
verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

a globally constant scaling in the fields and not to a local one as claimed. In
consequence, since in Grebenev et al. (2017) only the first equation within the
infinite and unclosed LMN chain is considered, also different Lie-group

The viscous pressure, which corresponds to the friction in the energy balance,

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is proven to be a very powerful tool to

Additionally, in order to further improve the discriminative power of the

promising results by taking advantage of the strong representation power of
deep networks. However, most existing deep hashing methods learn a whole set of
hashing functions independently, while ignore the correlations between
different hashing functions that can promote the retrieval accuracy greatly.
Inspired by the sequential decision ability of deep reinforcement learning, we
propose a new Deep Reinforcement Learning approach for Image Hashing (DRLIH).
Our proposed DRLIH approach models the hashing learning problem as a sequential
decision process, which learns each hashing function by correcting the errors
imposed by previous ones and promotes retrieval accuracy. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to address hashing problem from deep
reinforcement learning perspective. The main contributions of our proposed
DRLIH approach can be summarized as follows: (1) We propose a deep
reinforcement learning hashing network. In the proposed network, we utilize
recurrent neural network (RNN) as agents to model the hashing functions, which
take actions of projecting images into binary codes sequentially, so that the
current hashing function learning can take previous hashing functions' error
into account. (2) We propose a sequential learning strategy based on proposed
DRLIH. We define the state as a tuple of internal features of RNN's hidden
layers and image features, which can reflect history decisions made by the
agents. We also propose an action group method to enhance the correlation of
hash functions in the same group. Experiments on three widely-used datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DRLIH approach.

duration of the wet periods measured in days, are proposed to the definition of
extreme precipitation. This model demonstrates excellent fit with real data and
provides a theoretical base for the determination of asymptotic approximations
to the distributions of the maximum daily precipitation volume within a wet
period as well as the total precipitation volume over a wet period. The first
approach to the definition (and determination) of extreme precipitation is
based on the tempered Snedecor-Fisher distribution of the maximum daily
precipitation. According to this approach, a daily precipitation volume is
considered to be extreme, if it exceeds a certain (pre-defined) quantile of the
tempered Snedecor--Fisher distribution. The second approach is based on that
the total precipitation volume for a wet period has the gamma distribution.
Hence, the hypothesis that the total precipitation volume during a certain wet
period is extremely large can be formulated as the homogeneity hypothesis of a
sample from the gamma distribution. Two equivalent tests are proposed for
testing this hypothesis. Both of these tests deal with the relative
contribution of the total precipitation volume for a wet period to the
considered set (sample) of successive wet periods. Within the second approach
it is possible to introduce the notions of relatively and absolutely extreme
precipitation volumes. The results of the application of these tests to real
data are presented yielding the conclusion that the intensity of wet periods
with extreme large precipitation volume increases.

approximately two million years ago. Language abilities, and the ability to
shift between different modes of thought, evolved approximately 100,000 years

that well before this time, but after 100,000 years ago, and concurrent with
the evolution of a division of labour between creators and imitators there
arose a division of labour between past, present, and future thinkers.
Agent-based model research suggests there are social benefits to the evolution

novelty-generating creators and continuity-perpetuating imitators. A balance
between individuals focused on the past, present, and future would be expected
to yield similar adaptive benefits.

demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of the recently introduced ripple
compensation (RC) technique in reducing the audio distortion of the device. The
amplifier converts an input audio signal to a high-frequency train of
rectangular pulses, whose widths are modulated according to the input signal
(pulse-width modulation) and employs negative feedback. After determining the
steady-state operating point for constant input and calculating its stability,
we derive a small-signal model (SSM), which yields in closed form the transfer
function relating (infinitesimal) input and output disturbances. This SSM shows
how the RC technique is able to linearise the small-signal response of the
device. We extend this SSM through a fully nonlinear perturbation calculation
of the dynamics of the amplifier, based on the disparity in time scales between
the pulse train and the audio signal. We obtain the nonlinear response of the
amplifier to a general audio signal, avoiding the linearisation inherent in the
SSM; we thereby more precisely quantify the reduction in distortion achieved
through RC. Finally, simulations corroborate our theoretical predictions and
illustrate the dramatic deterioration in performance that occurs when the
amplifier is operated in an unstable regime. The perturbation calculation is
rather general, and may be adapted to quantify the way in which other nonlinear
negative-feedback pulse-modulated devices track a time-varying input signal
that slowly modulates the system parameters.

implications for physical theory are considered. Incorporation of these
alternative solution forms, herein deemed ""supplemental solutions"", into the
development of quantum field theory leads to a unique class of particle states,
which may provide simple resolutions of more than one extant problem in high
energy physics. The symmetry between the traditional and supplemental solutions
results in a direct and natural zero-point energy value of zero, and, as well,
a possible mechanism for cancelling the Higgs condensate energy, thereby
providing a potential resolution of the large cosmological constant problem.
Further, this symmetry may also resolve the Higgs gauge hierarchy problem.
Resolutions of seeming theoretic impediments to supplemental fields, in
particular, non-positive definite Fock space metric and vacuum decay, are
presented, and concomitant implications for unitarity are considered. As
supplemental solutions are already inherent in quantum field theory, little
change is required to the fundamental mathematics of the theory.

real and Fourier Plane (FP) microscopic dark field images of Surface Plasmons
(SP), excited on engineered 1D and 2D low aspect ratio periodic plasmonic
nanostructures. The periodic plasmonic nanostructures with period almost equal
to resonance wavelength, were engineered to exhibit transmission resonances as
transmission peaks in visible spectrum at normal incidence, without using
extraordinary optical transmission phenomena. The plasmonic nanostructures
exhibited a polarization rotation of 90 degree mediated by differential phase
retardation in the SP mode due to Transverse Electric and Magnetic components.
This was used to develop a dark field on-chip plasmonic polarization microscope
for imaging SP excitation in real and Fourier planes. After successful
integration of these plasmonic nanostructures with SU- 8 based microfluidic
channels, a real-time monitoring of label free on chip sensing was
demonstrated. Label-free on-chip imaging for interface of colorless miscible
and immiscible analytes flowing on plasmonic nanostructures in the microfluidic
channels were performed using color-selective filtering nature of plasmonic
nanostructures. Since the imaging is realized on a chip and does not need any
complicated and bulky arrangement, it will be well suited for on-chip point of
care diagnostics.

rate equation model (MD-RE approach) is presented to study the trapping and the
scattering of rare gas atoms from metal surfaces. The temporal evolution of the
atom fractions that are either adsorbed or scattered into the continuum is
investigated in detail. We demonstrate that for this description one has to
consider trapped, quasi-trapped and scattering states, and present an energetic
definition of these states. The rate equations contain the transition
probabilities between the states. We demonstrate how these rate equations can
be derived from kinetic theory. Moreover, we present a rigorous way to
determine the transition probabilities from a microscopic analysis of the
particle trajectories generated by MD simulations. Once the system reaches
quasi-equilibrium, the rates converge to stationary values, and the subsequent
thermal adsorption/desorption dynamics is completely described by the rate
equations without the need to perform further time-consuming MD simulations.
  As a proof of concept of our approach, MD simulations for argon atoms
interacting with a platinum (111) surface are presented. A detailed
deterministic trajectory analysis is performed, and the transition rates are
constructed. The dependence of the rates on the incidence conditions and the
lattice temperature is analyzed. Based on this example, we analyze the time
scale of the gas-surface system to approach the quasi-stationary state. The
MD-rate equation model has great relevance for the plasma-surface modeling as
it makes an extension of accurate simulations to long, experimentally relevant
time scales possible. Its application to the computation of atomic sticking
probabilities is given in the second part (paper II).

characterised as those maps with the right lifting property against certain
sets of maps (such classes are sometimes referred to as cofibrantly generated).
In a more sophisticated notion due to Garner (referred to as algebraically
cofibrantly generated) the set of maps is replaced with a diagram over a small
category.
  We give a yet more general definition where the set or diagram of maps is
replaced with a vertical map in a Grothendieck fibration. In addition to an
interesting new view of the existing examples above, we get new notions, such
as computable lifting problems in presheaf assemblies, and internal lifting
problems in a topos.
  We show that under reasonable conditions one can define a notion of universal
lifting problem and carry out step-one of Garner's small object argument. We
give explicit descriptions of what the general construction looks like in some
examples.

system, in which a local mobile user can offload intensive computation tasks to
multiple nearby edge devices serving as helpers for remote execution. We focus
on the scenario where the local user has a number of independent tasks that can
be executed in parallel but cannot be further partitioned. We consider a time
division multiple access (TDMA) communication protocol, in which the local user
can offload computation tasks to the helpers and download results from them
over pre-scheduled time slots. Under this setup, we minimize the local user's
computation latency by optimizing the task assignment jointly with the time and
power allocations, subject to individual energy constraints at the local user
and the helpers. However, the joint task assignment and wireless resource
allocation problem is a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) that is hard
to solve optimally. To tackle this challenge, we first relax it into a convex
problem, and then propose an efficient suboptimal solution based on the optimal
solution to the relaxed convex problem. Finally, numerical results show that
our proposed joint design significantly reduces the local user's computation
latency, as compared against other benchmark schemes that design the task
assignment separately from the offloading/downloading resource allocations and
local execution.

the scaling invariance of the equation. The proof is based on exploiting the
