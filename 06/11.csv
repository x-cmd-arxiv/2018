  actively selectable paths","4 pages, 4 figures, 21st IEEE Real Time Conference",,"10.1109/TNS.2019.2921982",,"eess.SP quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A variable-delay optical interferometer with 128 actively selectable delays
and a technique of active phase stabilization are innovatively designed and
applied for the first time in the experiment of round-robin differential phase
shift quantum key distribution (RRDPS-QKD). According to the RRDPS protocol,
larger number of delay channels in interferometer can ensure higher tolerance
of bit errors, eliminating the fundamental threshold of bit error rate of 11%
of traditional BB84 protocol. Considering that the implementation of RRDPS
protocol relys on the realizaiton of the interferometer, therefore, an
interferometer with 128 selectable delay paths is constructed and demands the
ability of fast switching at the rate of 10 kHz, which requires dynamic
stability of multiple paths. Thus, a specific designed phase stabilization
technique with closed real time feedback loop is introduced to guarantee the
high visibility of interferometer selections dynamically. The active phase
stabilization technique employs a phase modulator (PM) driven by a DAC to
adjust the relative phase between the two arms of the interferometer. By
monitoring photon counting rates of two Up-Conversion Detectors (UCD) at two
output ports of the interferometer, a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)
calculates and finds the optimal code value for the DAC, maintaining a high
visibility of the interferometer every time a new light path is selected. The
visibility of most of the 128 interferometer selections can simultaneously be
maintained over 96% during the QKD, which lays the foundation for the RRDPS
experiment.

  Aggregators","9 pages, 8 figures, journal",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To implement controllable loads for frequency regulation in transmission
networks in a practical way, the control scheme needs to be granulated down at
least to subtransmission networks since loads in transmission networks are
usually the aggregation of lower voltage networks. However, not only frequency
but also bus voltage will be affected by active power changes in
subtransmission networks due to a higher R/X ratio of transmission lines.
Further, the costs for loads participating in frequency and voltage regulation
should also be considered. In this paper, a control scheme is proposed for
electric spring (ES) aggregators which consist of back-to-back ESs and
exponential type of noncritical loads in subtransmission networks. A
distributed optimization which aims to minimize the costs and implements both
frequency and voltage regulation is adopted for ES aggregators to obtain new
active and reactive power setpoints by sharing information with neighbors.
Power consumption of each ES aggregator is then adjusted accordingly to conduct
frequency and voltage regulation simultaneously. Simulation results show that
ES aggregators are able to achieve required active power response and regulate
frequency cooperatively, and meanwhile maintain bus voltages within the
acceptable range with minimized costs under the proposed control scheme.

this aim, a B-DNA model and a thorough classification of DNA damage concerning
their complexity were used. Strand breaks were assumed to have been primarily
originated by direct physical interactions via energy depositions, assuming a
threshold energy of 17.5 eV, or indirect chemical reactions of hydroxyl
radicals, assuming a probability of 0.13. The simulation results on the
complexity and frequency of various damage are computed for proton energies of
0.5 to 20 MeV. The yield results for a cell (Gy.cell)-1 are presented, assuming
22 chromosomes per DNA and a mean number of 245 Mbp per chromosome. The results
show that for proton energies below 2 MeV, more than 50% of energy depositions
within the DNA volume resulted in strand breaks. For double-strand breaks
(DSBs), there is considerable sensitivity of DSB frequency to the proton
energy. A comparison of DSB frequencies predicted by different simulations and
experiments is presented as a function of proton LET. It is shown that,
generally, our yield results (Gy.Gbp)-1 are comparable with various

Large, thin CsI scintillator plates are the current candidates for the

light-collection efficiency and to understand the position dependence of such
thin plates. We have found a multi-channel readout that uses the coincidence
technique to be very effective in increasing the light output while keeping a
similar noise level to that of a single channel readout. Based on such a

spaces with asymptotic boundaries. The asymptotic boundary conditions are
imposed on background fields, while quantum fluctuations about these fields are
described in terms of quantum fields that vanish at the boundary. This leads us
to construct a suitable background field formalism that is generally applicable
to soft gauge algebras, and therefore to supergravity. We define a nilpotent
BRST charge that acts on both the background and the quantum fields, as well as
on the background and quantum ghosts. When the background is restricted to be
invariant under a residual isometry group, the background ghosts must be
restricted accordingly and play the role of the parameters of the background
isometries. Requiring in addition that the background ghosts will be BRST
invariant as well then converts the BRST algebra into an equivariant one. The
background fields and ghosts are then invariant under the equivariant
transformations while the quantum fields and ghosts transform under both the
equivariant and the background transformations. We demonstrate how this
formalism is suitable for carrying out localization calculations in a large
class of theories, including supergravity defined on asymptotic backgrounds
that admit supersymmetry.

science, with scientific work pursued collaboratively having increasingly led
to more highly impactful research than that pursued individually. However,
understanding of how the diversity of a collaborative team influences the
production of knowledge and innovation is sorely lacking. Here, we study this
question by breaking down the process of scientific collaboration of 32.9
million papers over the last five decades. We find that the probability of
producing a top-cited publication increases as a function of the diversity of a
team of collaborators---namely, the distinct number of institutions represented
by the team. We discover striking phenomena where a smaller, yet more diverse
team is more likely to generate highly innovative work than a relatively larger
team within one institution. We demonstrate that the synergy of collaboration
diversity is universal across different generations, research fields, and tiers
of institutions and individual authors. Our findings suggest that collaboration
diversity strongly and positively correlates with the production of scientific
innovation, giving rise to the potential revolution of the policies used by
funding agencies and authorities to fund research projects, and broadly the
principles used to organize teams, organizations, and societies.

facilitates observing and appraising the vessel wall structure of the human
coronary arteries. Segmentation of arterial wall boundaries from the IVUS
images is not only crucial for quantitative analysis of the vessel walls and
plaque characteristics, but is also necessary for generating 3D reconstructed
models of the artery. The aim of this study is twofold. Firstly, we investigate
the feasibility of using a recently proposed region detector, namely Extremal
Region of Extremum Level (EREL) to delineate the luminal and media-adventitia
borders in IVUS frames acquired by 20 MHz probes. Secondly, we propose a region
selection strategy to label two ERELs as lumen and media based on the stability
of their textural information. We extensively evaluated our selection strategy
on the test set of a standard publicly available dataset containing 326 IVUS
B-mode images. We showed that in the best case, the average Hausdorff Distances
(HD) between the extracted ERELs and the actual lumen and media were $0.22$ mm
and $0.45$ mm, respectively. The results of our experiments revealed that our
selection strategy was able to segment the lumen with $\le 0.3$ mm HD to the
gold standard even though the images contained major artifacts such as
bifurcations, shadows, and side branches. Moreover, when there was no artifact,
our proposed method was able to delineate media-adventitia boundaries with
$0.31$ mm HD to the gold standard. Furthermore, our proposed segmentation
method runs in time that is linear in the number of pixels in each frame. Based
on the results of this work, by using a 20 MHz IVUS probe with controlled
pullback, not only can we now analyze the internal structure of human arteries
more accurately, but also segment each frame during the pullback procedure
because of the low run time of our proposed segmentation method.

has approached this important subject in many ways which resulted in various
different classes of boolean nets. But yet, they are only distinguished by the
allowed interactions between places and transitions, that is, the possible
effects of firing transitions. There are eight different interactions: no
operation (nop), input (inp), output (out), set, reset (res), swap, test of
occupation (used), and test of disposability (free). Considering every
combination for a possible net class yields 256 boolean classes in total. The
synthesis problem for a particular class is to take an automaton A and compute
a boolean net of that class that has a state graph isomorphic to A. To the best
of our knowledge, the computational complexity of this problem has been
analyzed for just two of the 256 classes, namely elementary nets systems (nop,
inp, out), where the problem is NP-hard, and flip-flop nets (nop, inp, out,
swap), which are synthesizable in polynomial time. However, depending on the
desired net features, like read-only places, exception handling, or hierarchy,
one has to synthesize nets with other interactions as for instance contextual
nets (nop, inp, out, used, free) or trace nets (nop, inp, out, set, res, used,
free). The contribution of this paper is a thorough investigation of the
synthesis complexity for the 128 boolean net classes that allow nop. Our main
result is a general proof scheme that identifies 77 NP-hard cases. All
remaining 51 classes are shown to be synthesizable in polynomial time where 35
of them turn out to be trivial.

and Samotij, and independently by Saxton and Thomason, has proved to be an
extremely useful tool in the study of various monotone graph properties. In
particular, a fairly straightforward application of this technique allows one
to locate, for each non-bipartite graph $H$, the threshold at which the
distribution of edges in a typical $H$-free graph with a given number of edges
undergoes a transition from 'random-like' to 'structured'. On the other hand,
for non-monotone hereditary graph properties the standard version of this
method does not allow one to establish even the existence of such a threshold.
  In this paper we introduce a refinement of the container method that takes
into account the asymmetry between edges and non-edges in a sparse member of a
hereditary graph property. As an application, we determine the approximate
structure of a typical graph with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges, and no induced copy
of the $4$-cycle, for each function $m = m(n)$ satisfying $n^{4/3} (\log n)^4
\leqslant m \ll n^2$. We show that almost all such graphs $G$ have the
following property: the vertex set of $G$ can be partitioned into an
'almost-independent' set (a set with $o(m)$ edges) and an 'almost-clique' (a
set inducing a subgraph with density $1-o(1)$). The lower bound on $m$ is
optimal up to a polylogarithmic factor, as standard arguments show that if $n
\ll m \ll n^{4/3}$, then almost all such graphs are 'random-like'. As a further
consequence, we deduce that the random graph $G(n,p)$ conditioned to contain no
induced $4$-cycles undergoes phase transitions at $p = n^{-2/3 + o(1)}$ and $p
= n^{-1/3 + o(1)}$.

model and simulate a realistic and efficient synthesis route, mimicking
cross-linking of functionalized chains inside a cavity. This model is inspired,
e.g., by microfluidic fabrication of microgels from macromolecular precursors
and is different from standard polymerization routes. The assembly of the
chains is mediated by a low fraction of interchain crosslinks. The microgels
are polydisperse in size and shape but globally spherical objects. In order to
deeply understand the microgel structure and eventually improve the synthesis
protocol we characterize their conformational properties and deswelling
kinetics, and compare them with the results found for microgels obtained via
underlying regular (diamond-like) structures. The specific microstructure of
the microgel has no significant effect on the locus of the volume phase
transition (VPT). However, it strongly affects the deswelling kinetics, as
revealed by a consistent analysis of the domain growth during the microgel
collapse. Though both the disordered and the regular networks exhibit a similar
early growth of the domains, an acceleration is observed in the regular network
at the late stage of the collapse. Similar trends are found for the dynamic
correlations coupled to the domain growth. As a consequence, the fast late
processes for the domain growth and the dynamic correlations in the regular
network are compensated, and the dynamic correlations follow a power-law
dependence on the growing length scale that is independent of the microgel
microstructure.

with a large amount of contaminants among which BTEX, PAHs and heavy metals are
considered to be the most important components. Employing conventional
physicochemical techniques for remediation of such a polluted soil is both
technically and economically challenging. Bioremediation, which involves taking
advantage of the microorganisms for the removal of pollutants, is the most
promising technology which is both relatively efficient and cost-effective. In
this study, the coupled bioventing-biosparging technique and the
phytoextraction process were utilized to remediate the deep and shallow layers

the cement components in the site influenced the performance of bioremediation
techniques. The results of this study indicated that the cement- polluted soil
lowered the degradation rate of both BTEX (Ethylbenzene) and PAH (Pyrene)
pollutants within deep layers. Conversely, the degradation rate of Pb was
increased in phytoextraction process due to proper stabilization of the
surficial soil in presence of cement components. This study provides a critical
view on the limitations and influential parameters of function-directed soil

QA). The key idea is to infer two sets of embeddings: one for the image and the
question jointly and the other for the answers. The learning objective is to
learn the best parameterization of those embeddings such that the correct
answer has higher likelihood among all possible answers. In contrast to several
existing approaches of treating Visual QA as multi-way classification, the
proposed approach takes the semantic relationships (as characterized by the
embeddings) among answers into consideration, instead of viewing them as
independent ordinal numbers. Thus, the learned embedded function can be used to
embed unseen answers (in the training dataset). These properties make the
approach particularly appealing for transfer learning for open-ended Visual QA,
where the source dataset on which the model is learned has limited overlapping
with the target dataset in the space of answers. We have also developed
large-scale optimization techniques for applying the model to datasets with a
large number of answers, where the challenge is to properly normalize the

challenge is that the two datasets are constructed differently, resulting in
the cross-dataset mismatch on images, questions, or answers.

Our method reduces the difference in statistical distributions by transforming
the feature representation of the data in the target dataset. Moreover, it
maximizes the likelihood of answering questions (in the target dataset)

It is known that the fit of an \emph{ordinary least squares} (OLS) regression
is independent of certain transformations of the coding of the predictor
variables, and that the standard mixed model \emph{ridge regression best linear
unbiased prediction} (RRBLUP) is neither affected by translations of the
variable coding, nor by global scaling. However, it has been reported that an
extended version of this mixed model, which incorporates interactions by
products of markers as additional predictor variables is affected by
translations of the marker coding. In this work, we identify the cause of this
loss of invariance in a general context of penalized regression on polynomials
in the predictor variables. We show that in most cases, translating the coding
of the predictor variables has an impact on effect estimates, with an exception
when only the size of the coefficients of monomials of highest total degree are
penalized. The invariance of RRBLUP can thus be considered as a special case of
this setting, with a polynomial of total degree 1, where the size of the fixed
effect (total degree 0) is not penalized but all coefficients of monomials of
total degree 1 are. The extended RRBLUP, which includes interactions, is not
invariant to translations because it does not only penalize interactions (total
degree 2), but also additive effects (total degree 1). Our observations are not
restricted to ridge regression, but generally valid for penalized regressions,
for instance also for the $\ell_1$ penalty of LASSO.

maintain accuracy as $k$ increases. The action of the preconditioner requires
solution of independent (parallel) subproblems (with impedance boundary
conditions) on overlapping subdomains of diameter $H$ and overlap $\delta\leq

prolongation/restriction operators defined using a partition of unity. In
numerical experiments (with $\delta \sim H$) for a model interior impedance
problem, we observe robust (i.e. $k-$independent) GMRES convergence as $k$

decomposition method. We provide supporting theory by studying the
preconditioner applied to a range of absorptive problems, $k^2\mapsto k^2+

the Helmholtz ``energy'' inner product, and using the underlying theory of

polonium isotopes Po-208, Po-209 and Po-210 and the simulated results using
MCNPX2.7.0 was presented. The lead samples were cut from the SINQ spallation
target at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) and irradiated in 2000/2001 by 575
MeV protons. The Po-isotopes were separated using radiochemical methods by the
group of D. Schumann at PSI and measured. Choosing the default model in MCNPX,
Bertini-Dresner, the prediction underestimated the measured activities by up to
several orders of magnitude. Therefore the Li\`ege intranuclear-cascade model
(INCL4.6) coupled to the de-excitation model ABLA07 were implemented into
MCNPX2.7.0 and very good agreement was found to the measurement. The reason for
the disagreement was traced back to a suppression of alpha reactions on the
lead isotopes leading to Po and neglecting the triton capture on Pb-208, which
leads to Pb-210 and decays into Po-210 with a much longer life time (22.3
years) than the decay of Po-210 itself (138 days). The prediction of the
Po-isotope activities turns out to be a sensitive test for models and codes as
it requires the accurate treatment of reaction channels not only with neutrons,
protons and pions but also with alphas and tritons, which are not considered in
intra-nuclear cascade models of the first generation. Therefore it was decided
to perform a benchmark by comparing the results obtained with MCNPX2.7.0 using
INCL4.6/ABLA07 to the predictions of FLUKA and Geant4. Since the model of the
SINQ spallation source requires an elaborate geometry a toy model was setup.
The toy model has a simplified geometry preserving the main features of the
original geometry. The results for the activities of the three Po-isotopes and
Pb-210 as well as the energy spectra for alphas and tritons obtained with the
three particle transport Monte Carlo codes are presented.

this case, recommendations for user's immediate next actions need to be
generated based on patterns in anonymous short sessions. An often overlooked
aspect is that new items with limited observations arrive continuously in many

be adaptive to such frequent changes. In this paper, we benchmark a new

the standard static evaluation protocol adopted by previous literatures, we
include an adaptive configuration to mimic the situation when new items with

two best-performing approaches (recurrent neural network; heuristic-based

analyze reasons for this and demonstrate that it is because of the better
adaptation to changes in the domain, as well as the remarkable capability to
learn static sequential patterns. Moreover, our running time analysis
illustrates the efficiency of using CT as other nonparametric methods.

in a commutative ring all prime ideals are finitely generated then every ideal

finitely generated doesn't imply all ideals be finitely generated. In his
article we ask the question that what happens if we assume all non-maximal
ideals are finitely generated, and we answer the question by showing that
indeed then all maximal ideals are also finitely generated i.e. the ring

For the directed model, we prove that it follows the Cohen-Lenstra heuristics,

group is a given $p$-group $P$, is proportional to $|Aut(P)|^{-1}$. For
finitely many primes, these events get independent in the limit. Similar
results hold for undirected random regular graphs, where for odd primes the
limiting distributions are the ones given by Clancy, Leake and Payne.

of a random regular graph is invertible with high probability. Note that for
directed graphs this was recently proved by Huang. It also gives an alternate

We then use simulated flux-limited data with three different known intrinsic
luminosity correlations, and prescribed luminosity functions and evolution
similar to the ones expected for quasars. We explore how the intrinsic nature
of luminosity correlations can be deduced, including exploring the efficacy of
partial correlation analysis with redshift binning in determining whether
luminosity correlations are intrinsic and finding the form of the intrinsic

show that we can recover the true cosmological evolution of the luminosity

demonstrate the methods for determining intrinsic luminosity correlations on
actual observed samples of quasars with mid-infrared, radio, and optical fluxes

different forecasts by comparing them with observations. The probability
distribution of the observed record is assumed to be perfect as a verification
benchmark. In practice, however, observations are almost always tainted by
errors and uncertainties. If the yardstick used to compare forecasts is
imprecise, one can wonder whether such types of errors may or may not have a
strong influence on decisions based on classical scoring rules. We propose a
new scoring rule scheme in the context of models that incorporate errors of the
verification data. We rely on existing scoring rules and incorporate
uncertainty and error of the verification data through a hidden variable and
the conditional expectation of scores when they are viewed as a random
variable. The proposed scoring framework is compared to scores used in
practice, and is expressed in various setups, mainly an additive Gaussian noise
model and a multiplicative Gamma noise model. By considering scores as random
variables one can access the entire range of their distribution. In particular
we illustrate that the commonly used mean score can be a misleading
representative of the distribution when this latter is highly skewed or have
heavy tails. In a simulation study, through the power of a statistical test and
the computation of Wasserstein distances between scores distributions, we
demonstrate the ability of the newly proposed score to better discriminate
between forecasts when verification data are subject to uncertainty compared
with the scores used in practice. Finally, we illustrate the benefit of
accounting for the uncertainty of the verification data into the scoring
procedure on a dataset of surface wind speed from measurements and numerical

cavity frequency. This novel mechanism of optomechanical interactions, as
predicted recently by Cotrufo et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 133603 (2017)], is
fundamentally different from standard ones. In the enhanced atom-phonon

generate critical dynamics affecting social interactions, transport
connectivity and income flow distribution. We develop a statistical-mechanical
model of urban transformations, exemplified for Greater Sydney, and derive a
thermodynamic description highlighting critical regimes. We consider urban
dynamics at two time scales: fast dynamics for the distribution of population
and income, modelled via the maximum entropy principle, and slower dynamics
evolving the urban structure under spatially distributed competition. We
identify phase transitions between dispersed and polycentric phases, induced by
varying the social disposition---a factor balancing the suburbs'
attractiveness---in contrast with the travel impedance. Using the Fisher
information we identify critical thresholds and quantify the thermodynamic cost
of urban transformation, as the minimal work required to vary the underlying
parameter. Finally, we introduce the notion of thermodynamic efficiency of
urban transformation, as the ratio of the order gained during a change to the
amount of required work, showing that this measure is maximised at criticality.

In order to overcome scalability issues, Burer and Monteiro proposed a

twofold: the dimension of the optimization variable is reduced and positive
semidefiniteness is naturally enforced. However, the problem in Y is
non-convex. In prior work, it has been shown that, when the constraints on the

which approximately satisfy necessary optimality conditions, leading to the
question: are such points also approximately optimal? To this end, and under
similar assumptions, we use smoothed analysis to show that approximate SOSPs

k scaling like the square root of the number of constraints (up to log
factors). Moreover, we bound the optimality gap at the approximate solution of
the perturbed problem with respect to the original problem. We particularize

three-dimensional (3D) molecular structures lies on a family of low-dimensional
manifolds embedded in a high-dimensional data space. We encode crucial
chemical, physical and biological information into 2D element interactive
manifolds, extracted from a high-dimensional structural data space via a
multiscale discrete-to-continuum mapping using differentiable density
estimators. Differential geometry apparatuses are utilized to construct element
interactive curvatures %Gaussian curvature, mean curvature, minimum curvature

representations are paired with a robust machine learning algorithm to showcase
their descriptive and predictive powers for large, diverse and complex

carried out to demonstrated that the proposed DG-GL strategy outperforms other

finding. One major conceptual challenge of Hawking evaporation is the
associated black hole information loss paradox, which remains unresolved. A key
factor to the issue is the end-stage of the black hole evaporation.
Unfortunately by then the evaporation process becomes non-perturbative. Aspired
to provide a tool for the eventual solution to this problem, here we introduce
a new interpretation of Hawking radiation as the tunneling of instantons. We
study instantons of a massless scalar field in Einstein gravity. We consider a
complex-valued instanton that connects an initial pure black hole state to a
black hole with a scalar field that represents the Hawking radiation at future
null infinity, where its action depends only on the areal entropy difference.
By comparing it with several independent approaches to Hawking radiation in the
perturbative limit, we conclude that Hawking radiation may indeed be described
by a family of instantons. Since the instanton approach can describe
non-perturbative processes, we hope that our new interpretation and holistic
method may shed lights on the information loss problem.

general theory for such a pairing state, which we show to be nonunitary. A

between the DFPE solutions and the observed GSDs for $i = 0, 1, 2, 3$.
Furthermore, we develop numerical methods to address the inverse problem,
namely the problem of obtaining the gap fragmentation probability from the
observed GSD, and again find good self-consistency in the approach. This has
consequences for its application to experimental situations where only the GSD
is observed, and where the growth rules embodied in the fragmentation process
must be deduced.

  Epidemic Models",,,,,"q-bio.PE math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stochastic epidemic models, generally more realistic than deterministic
counterparts, have often been seen too complex for rigorous mathematical
analysis because of level of details it requires to comprehensively capture the
dynamics of diseases. This problem further becomes intense when complexity of
diseasees increases as in the case of vector-borne diseases (VBD). The VBDs are
human illnesses caused by pathogens transmitted among humans by intermediate
species, which are primarily arthropods. In this study, a stochastic VBD model
is developed and novel mathematical methods are described and evaluated to
systematically analyze the model and understand its complex dynamics. The VBD
model incorporates some relevant features of the VBD transmission process
including demographical, ecological and social mechanisms. The analysis is
based on dimensional reductions and model simplications via scaling limit
theorems. The results suggest that the dynamics of the stochastic VBD depends
on a threshold quantity R_0, the initial size of infectives, and the type of
scaling in terms of host population size. The quantity R_0 for deterministic
counterpart of the model, interpreted as threshold condition for infection
persistence as is mentioned in the literature for many infectious disease
models, can be computed. Different scalings yield different approximations of
the model, and in particular, if vectors have much faster dynamics, the effect
of the vector dynamics on the host population averages out, which largely
reduces the dimension of the model.

fundamental activities in experimental science. However, quantum theory shows a
peculiar difficulty in extending the classical notion of root-mean-square (rms)
error to quantum measurements. A straightforward generalization based on the
noise-operator was used to reformulate Heisenberg's uncertainty relation for
the accuracy of simultaneous measurements to be universally valid and made the
conventional formulation testable to observe its violation. Recently, its
reliability was examined based on an anomaly that the error vanishes for some
imprecise measurements, in which the meter does not commute with the measured
observable. Here, we propose an improved definition for a quantum
generalization of the classical rms error, which is state-dependent,
operationally definable, and perfectly characterizes precise measurements.
Moreover, it is shown that the new notion maintains the previously obtained
universally valid uncertainty relations and their experimental confirmations
without changing their forms and interpretations, in contrast to a prevailing
view that a state-dependent formulation for measurement uncertainty relation is
not tenable.

of the number of noise-driven individuals, including the case of only one

However, very limited information is known about the physical properties of the

photometric data from 2MASS, WISE, and Herschel with Spitzer spectroscopy. Our
fits favor recent torus spectral models that properly treat the different
sublimation temperatures of silicates and graphite and consider a polar wind
component. The AGN-heated dust emission from the torus contributes a
significant fraction ($\sim 70\%$) of the total infrared ($1-1000\, \mu$m)
luminosity. The torus luminosity correlates well with the strength of the
ultraviolet/optical continuum and the broad $\rm{H\beta}$ emission line,
indicating a close link between the central ionization source and re-radiation
by the torus. Consistent with the unified model, most quasars have tori that
are only mildly inclined along the line-of-sight. The half-opening angle of the
torus, a measure of its covering factor, declines with increasing accretion
rate until the Eddington ratio reaches $\sim 0.5$, above which the trend
reverses. This behavior likely results from the change of the geometry of the
accretion flow, from a standard geometrically thin disk at moderate accretion
rates to a slim disk at high accretion rates.

displacement scattering) are found to be relatively weak in most cases.

degassing at mid-ocean ridges, hot spots, and arcs into account. The
differences in D/H ratios between present-day oceans, oceanic and continental
crust, and mantle are thought to reflect isotopic fractionation through
seafloor alteration, chemical alteration, and slab dehydration. However, if the
speed of plate tectonics has been nearly constant through out Earth's history,
the degassing and regassing rates are too small to reach the present-day D/H
ratios. We show that (a) hydrogen escape from reduced early atmosphere, (b)
secular net regassing, or (c) faster plate tectonics on early Earth is needed
to reproduce the present-day D/H ratios of the water reservoirs. The low D/H
ratio of Archean seawater at 3.8 Ga has previously been interpreted as a
signature of (a) hydrogen escape, but we find it can also be explained either
by (b) secular net regassing or by (c) faster plate tectonics on early Earth.
The rates of hydrogen escape from early Earth and secular regassing on
present-day Earth are constrained to be lower than 2.1 x 10^11 kg/yr and 3.9 x
10^11 kg/yr. Consequently, the volume of water in the present-day mantle could
result entirely from the regassing through Earth's history. In that case, the
volume of initial oceans could be 2 to 3 times larger than that of current
Earth. We suggest that, in addition to the D/H ratio of Archean seawater,
identifying the D/H ratios of both seawater and mantle throughout Earth's
history would allow to distinguish these evolutionary scenarios.

surface describing the two-body two-spring chain. That surface can include {\it
at least two} distinct chaotic seas. Aoki pointed out that the model typically
exhibits different kinetic temperatures for the two bodies. Evidently few-body
$\phi^4$ problems merit more investigation. Accordingly, the 2018 Prizes

discretizations of the advection-diffusion equation. The amount of
hyperviscosity is determined quasi-analytically for commonly-used explicit,
implicit, and implicit-explicit (IMEX) time integrators by using a simple 1D
semi-discrete Von Neumann analysis. The analysis is applied to an analytical
model of spurious growth in RBF-FD solutions that uses auxiliary differential
operators mimicking the undesirable properties of RBF-FD differentiation
matrices. The resulting hyperviscosity formulation is a generalization of
existing ones in the literature, but is free of any tuning parameters and can
be computed efficiently. To further improve robustness, we introduce a simple
new scaling law for polynomial-augmented RBF-FD that relates the degree of
polyharmonic spline (PHS) RBFs to the degree of the appended polynomial. When
used in a novel ghost node formulation in conjunction with the
recently-developed overlapped RBF-FD method, the resulting method is robust and
free of stagnation errors. We validate the high-order convergence rates of our
method on 2D and 3D test cases over a wide range of Peclet numbers (1-1000). We
then use our method to solve a 3D coupled problem motivated by models of
platelet aggregation and coagulation, again demonstrating high-order

theoretical investigations, namely, an efficient and accurate algorithm of
absolute formation energy of h-BN edges, and a good understanding of the role
of hydrogen passivation during h-BN growth. Here, we first proposed an
efficient algorithm to calculate asymmetric edges with a self-consistent

standard approach for other two-dimensional (2D) compound materials. Then, by
using this method, we discovered that only when edges are passivated by
hydrogen atoms and temperature effects are taken into account can experimental
morphology be explained. We further employed Wulff construction to obtain the
equilibrium shapes of H-passivated h-BN nanosheets under its typical growth
conditions at T = 1300 K and p = 1 bar, and found out that the equilibrium
shapes are sensitive to hydrogen passivation and the growth conditions. Our
results resolved long-standing discrepancies between experimental observations

Realizing the nilpotent covering graph into a nilpotent Lie group through a
discrete harmonic map, we give a geometric characterization of the limit
semigroup on the nilpotent Lie group. More precisely, we show that the limit
semigroup is generated by the sub-Laplacian with a non-trivial drift on the

from the non-symmetry of the random walk and it vanishes when the random walk
is symmetric. Furthermore, by imposing the ""centered condition"", we establish a
functional CLT (i.e., Donsker-type invariance principle) in a Hoelder space
over the nilpotent Lie group. The functional CLT is extended to the case where
the realization is not necessarily harmonic. We also obtain an explicit

effect of electric fields on charge carriers formed under illumination of a
polymer film is to exploit the fluorescence arising from delayed recombination
of carrier pairs, a process which is fundamentally spin dependent. Such
spin-dependent recombination can be probed directly in fluorescence, by
optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). Depending on the relative
orientation, an electric field may either dissociate or stabilize an
electron-hole carrier pair. We find that the ODMR signal in a polymer film is
quenched in an electric field, but that, at fields exceeding 1 MV/cm, this
quenching saturates. This finding contrasts the complete ODMR suppression that
was previously observed in polymeric photodiodes, indicating that
exciton-charge interactions---analogous to Auger recombination in crystalline

$k$-sink location problem is to place $k$-sinks so as to minimize this
evacuation time. Although the $k$-sink location problem is NP-Hard on a general

standard alpha cluster models, however, each alpha cluster wave function has
spin zero because of its spatial symmetry and antisymmetrization effect. Thus
the non-central interactions do not contribute, and this situation is the same
in the THSR wave function. In this work, the spin-orbit contribution, which is
found to be quite important at short alpha-alpha distances, is taken into
account in the THSR wave function by combing it with antisymmetrized quasi

multi-integration in the original THSR wave function is carried out by using
Monte Carlo technique, which is called Monte Carlo THSR wave function. For the

formalizes this value alignment problem as a two-player game between a human

the robot needs to learn them as the interaction unfolds. Previous work showed
that CIRL can be solved as a POMDP, but with an action space size exponential

property of CIRL---the human is a full information agent---to derive an
optimality-preserving modification to the standard Bellman update; this reduces
the complexity of the problem by an exponential factor and allows us to relax
CIRL's assumption of human rationality. We apply this update to a variety of
POMDP solvers and find that it enables us to scale CIRL to non-trivial

both robot and human. In solutions to these larger problems, the human exhibits
pedagogic (teaching) behavior, while the robot interprets it as such and

three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations, including non-equilibrium
chemical reactions and heating/cooling processes. We consider super-Alfv\'enic
head-on colliding flows of atomic gas possessing the two-phase structure that
consists of HI clouds and surrounding warm diffuse gas. We examine how the
formation of molecular clouds depends on the angle $\theta$ between the
upstream flow and the mean magnetic field. We find that there is a critical
angle $\theta_\mathrm{cr}$ above which the shock-amplified magnetic field
controls the post-shock gas dynamics. If the atomic gas is compressed almost
along the mean magnetic field ($\theta\ll\theta_\mathrm{cr}$), super-Alfv\'enic
anisotropic turbulence is maintained by the accretion of the highly
inhomogeneous upstream atomic gas. As a result, a greatly extended
turbulence-dominated post-shock layer is generated. Around $\theta\sim
\theta_\mathrm{cr}$, the shock-amplified magnetic field weakens the post-shock
turbulence, leading to a dense post-shock layer. For $\theta\gg
\theta_\mathrm{cr}$, the strong magnetic pressure suppresses the formation of
cold dense clouds. Efficient molecular cloud formation is expected if $\theta$
is less than a few times $\theta_\mathrm{cr}$. Developing an analytic model and
performing a parameter survey, we obtain an analytic formula for the critical
angle as a function of the mean density, collision speed, and field strength of
the upstream atomic gas. The critical angle is found to be less than $\sim
15^\circ$ as long as the field strength is larger than $1~\mu$G, indicating
that the probability of occurrence of compression with
$\theta<\theta_\mathrm{cr}$ is limited if shock waves come from various
directions.

Initially, a small dipole emerged and its associated arch filament system was

bright points. When bright points faded out, many elongated dark threads formed
bridging the positive magnetic element of dipole and external negative network
fields. Interestingly, an anti-clockwise photospheric rotational motion (PRM)
set in within the positive endpoint region of newborn dark threads following
the flux emergence and lasted for more than 10 hours. Under the drive of the
PRM, these dispersive dark threads gradually aligned along the north-south
direction and finally coalesced into an inverse S-shaped filament. Consistent
with the dextral chirality of the filament, magnetic helicity calculations show
that an amount of negative helicity was persistently injected from the
rotational positive magnetic element and accumulated during the formation of
the filament. These observations suggest that twisted emerging fields may lead
to the formation of the filament via reconnection with pre-existing fields and
release of its inner magnetic twist. The persistent PRM might trace a covert
twist relaxation from below photosphere to the low corona.

investigate short gamma-ray burst (GRB) jet afterglows without the GRB trigger.
Here we show that the post-peak afterglow decline can distinguish between an
initially ultra-relativistic jet viewed off-axis and a mildly relativistic
wide-angle outflow. Post-peak the afterglow flux will decline as $F_\nu \propto
t^{-\alpha}$. The steepest decline for a jet afterglow is $\alpha>3p/4$ or $>
(3p+1)/4$, for an observation frequency below and above the cooling frequency,
respectively, where $p$ is the power-law index of the electron energy
distribution. The steepest decline for a mildly relativistic outflow, with
initial Lorentz factor $\Gamma_0\lesssim 2$, is $\alpha\lesssim(15p-19)/10$ or
$\alpha\lesssim(15p-18)/10$, in the respective spectral regimes. If the
afterglow from GW170817 fades with a maximum index $\alpha > 1.5$ then we are
observing the core of an initially ultra-relativistic jet viewed off the
central axis, while a decline with $\alpha\lesssim 1.4$ after $\sim 5$--10 peak
times indicates that a wide-angled and initially $\Gamma_0\lesssim 2$ outflow
is responsible. At twice the peak time, the two outflow models fall on opposite
sides of $\alpha \approx 1$. So far, two post-peak X-ray data points at 160 and
260 days suggest a decline consistent with an off-axis jet afterglow. Follow-up
observations over the next 1--2 years will test this model.

and the interplay of bio-molecules is widely recognised. Consequently, many
algorithms for the analysis and the comparison of networks (such as alignment
algorithms) have been developed in the past. Recently, many different
approaches tried to integrate into a single model the interplay of different
molecules, such as genes, transcription factors and microRNAs. A possible
formalism to model such scenario comes from node coloured networks (or
heterogeneous networks) implemented as node/ edge-coloured graphs.
Consequently, the need for the introduction of alignment algorithms able to
analyse heterogeneous networks arises. To the best of our knowledge, all the
existing algorithms are not able to mine heterogeneous networks. We propose a
two-step alignment strategy that receives as input two heterogeneous networks
(node-coloured graphs) and a similarity function among nodes of two networks
extending the previous formulations. We first build a single alignment graph.
Then we mine this graph extracting relevant subgraphs. Despite this simple
approach, the analysis of such networks relies on graph and subgraph
isomorphism and the size of the data is still growing. Therefore the use of
high-performance data analytics framework is needed. We here present
HetNetAligner a framework built on top of Apache Spark. We also implemented our
algorithm, and we tested it on some selected heterogeneous biological networks.
Preliminary results confirm that our method may extract relevant knowledge from
biological data reducing the computational time.

astrophysics biases in the standardization of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) for
cosmology, we have statistically classified a large sample of nearby SNeIa into
those located in predominantly younger or older environments. This
classification is based on the specific star formation rate measured within a
projected distance of 1kpc from each SN location (LsSFR). This is an important
refinement compared to using the local star formation rate directly as it
provides a normalization for relative numbers of available SN progenitors and
is more robust against extinction by dust. We find that the SNeIa in
predominantly younger environments are DY=0.163\pm0.029 mag (5.7 sigma) fainter
than those in predominantly older environments after conventional light-curve
standardization. This is the strongest standardized SN Ia brightness systematic
connected to host-galaxy environment measured to date. The well-established
step in standardized brightnesses between SNeIa in hosts with lower or higher
total stellar masses is smaller at DM=0.119\pm0.032 mag (4.5 sigma), for the
same set of SNeIa. When fit simultaneously, the environment age offset remains
very significant, with DY=0.129\pm0.032 mag (4.0 sigma), while the global
stellar mass step is reduced to DM=0.064\pm0.029 mag (2.2 sigma). Thus,
approximately 70% of the variance from the stellar mass step is due to an
underlying dependence on environment-based progenitor age. Standardization
using only the SNeIa in younger environments reduces the total dispersion from
0.142\pm0.008 mag to 0.120\pm0.010 mag. We show that as environment ages evolve
with redshift a strong bias on measurement of the dark energy equation of state
parameters can develop. Fortunately, data to measure and correct for this
effect is likely to be available for many next-generation experiments.

sensitive hyperparameters, the interplay between them and other elements that
provide implicit regularization is not well understood yet. Shedding light upon
these interactions is key to efficiently using computational resources and may
contribute to solving the puzzle of generalization in deep learning. Here, we
first provide formal definitions of explicit and implicit regularization that
help understand essential differences between techniques. Second, we contrast
data augmentation with weight decay and dropout. Our results show that visual
object categorization models trained with data augmentation alone achieve the
same performance or higher than models trained also with weight decay and
dropout, as is common practice. We conclude that the contribution on
generalization of weight decay and dropout is not only superfluous when
sufficient implicit regularization is provided, but also such techniques can
dramatically deteriorate the performance if the hyperparameters are not
carefully tuned for the architecture and data set. In contrast, data
augmentation systematically provides large generalization gains and does not
require hyperparameter re-tuning. In view of our results, we suggest to
optimize neural networks without weight decay and dropout to save computational
resources, hence carbon emissions, and focus more on data augmentation and
other inductive biases to improve performance and robustness.

(SNe II) occurring within low-luminosity galaxies, comparing these with a
sample of events in brighter hosts. Our analysis is performed comparing SN II
spectral and photometric parameters and estimating the influence of metallicity
(inferred from host luminosity differences) on SN II transient properties. We
measure the SN absolute magnitude at maximum, the light-curve plateau duration,
the optically thick duration, and the plateau decline rate in the V-band,
together with expansion velocities and pseudo-equivalent-widths (pEWs) of
several absorption lines in the SN spectra. For the SN host galaxies, we
estimate the absolute magnitude and the stellar mass, a proxy for the
metallicity of the host galaxy. SNe II exploding in low luminosity galaxies
display weaker pEWs of Fe II $\lambda5018$, confirming the theoretical
prediction that metal lines in SN II spectra should correlate with metallicity.
We also find that SNe II in low-luminosity hosts have generally slower
declining light curves and display weaker absorption lines. We find no
relationship between the plateau duration or the expansion velocities with SN
environment, suggesting that the hydrogen envelope mass and the explosion
energy are not correlated with the metallicity of the host galaxy. This result
supports recent predictions that mass-loss for red supergiants is independent
of metallicity.

concern when dealing with space travel. It has been shown that determining a
realistic population size is tricky as many parameters (such as infertility,
inbreeding, sudden deaths, accidents or random events) come into play. To
evaluate the impact of those parameters, Monte Carlo simulations are among the
best methods since they allow testing of all possible scenarios and determine,
by numerous iterations, which are the most likely. This is why we use the Monte
Carlo code HERITAGE to estimate the minimal crew for a multi-generational space
travel towards Proxima Centauri b. By allowing the crew to evolve under a list
of adaptive social engineering principles (namely yearly evaluations of the
vessel population, offspring restrictions and breeding constraints), we show in
this paper that it is possible to create and maintain a healthy population
virtually indefinitely. A initial amount of 25 breeding pairs of settlers
drives the mission towards extinction in 50 +/- 15% of cases if we completely
forbid inbreeding. Under the set of parameters described in this publication,
we find that a minimum crew of 98 people is necessary ensure a 100% success
rate for a 6300-year space travel towards the closest telluric exoplanet known

architecture is proposed, where the aerial High Altitude Platforms (HAPs)
proactively push contents to vehicles through large-area broadcast while the
ground roadside units (RSUs) provide high-rate unicast services on demand. To
efficiently manage the multi-dimensional heterogeneous resources, a
service-oriented network slicing approach is introduced, where the AGIVEN is
virtually divided into multiple slices and each slice supports a specific
application with guaranteed quality of service (QoS). Specifically, the
fundamental problem of multi-resource provisioning in AGIVEN slicing is
investigated, by taking into account typical vehicular applications of
location-based map and popularity-based content services. For the
location-based map service, the capability of HAP-vehicle proactive pushing is
derived with respect to the HAP broadcast rate and vehicle cache size, wherein
a saddle point exists indicating the optimal communication-cache resource
trading. For the popular contents of common interests, the average on-board
content hit ratio is obtained, with HAPs pushing newly generated contents to
keep on-board cache fresh. Then, the minimal RSU transmission rate is derived
to meet the average delay requirements of each slice. The obtained analytical
results reveal the service-dependent resource provisioning and trading
relationships among RSU transmission rate, HAP broadcast rate, and vehicle
cache size, which provides guidelines for multi-resource network slicing in
practice. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed AGIVEN network
slicing approach matches the multi-resources across slices, whereby the RSU
transmission rate can be saved by 40% while maintaining the same QoS.

heat sources in the crust of accreting neutron stars. Heat is thought to be
released by electroweak and nuclear processes triggered by the burying of ashes
of X-ray bursts. The heating is studied using a fully quantum approach taking
consistently into account nuclear shell effects. We have followed the evolution
of ashes made of $^{56}$Fe employing the nuclear energy-density functional
theory. Both the outer and inner crusts are described using the same
functional, thus ensuring a unified and thermodynamically consistent treatment.
To assess the role of the neutron-matter constraint, we have employed the set
of accurately calibrated Brussels-Montreal functionals BSk19, BSk20, and BSk21
and for comparison the SLy4 functional. Due to nuclear shell effects, the fully
accreted crust is found to be much less stratified than in previous studies. In
particular, large regions of the inner crust contain clusters with the magic
number $Z=14$. The heat deposited in the outer crust is tightly constrained by
experimental atomic mass data. The shallow heating we obtain does not exceed
$0.2$~MeV and is therefore not enough to explain the cooling of some soft X-ray
transients. The total heat released in the crust is very sensitive to details
of the nuclear structure and is predicted to lie in the range from $1.5$~MeV to
$1.7$~MeV. The evolution of an accreted matter element and therefore the
location of heat sources are governed to a large extent by the existence of
nuclear shell closures. Ignoring these effects in the inner crust, the total
heat falls to $\sim 0.6$~MeV. The neutron-matter constraint is also found to
play a key role. The large amount of heat obtained by Steiner et al. (2012)
could thus be traced back to unrealistic neutron-matter equations of state.

potential agents with {\em interdependent values}. That is, each agent has her
own private signal, and the valuation of each agent is a known function of all
$n$ private signals. This captures settings such as valuations for artwork, oil
drilling rights, broadcast rights, and many more.
  In the interdependent value setting, all previous work has assumed a
so-called {\sl single-crossing condition}. Single-crossing means that the
impact of agent $i$'s private signal, $s_i$, on her own valuation is greater
than the impact of $s_i$ on the valuation of any other agent. It is known that
without the single-crossing condition an efficient outcome cannot be obtained.
We study welfare maximization for interdependent valuations through the lens of
approximation.
  We show that, in general, without the single-crossing condition, one cannot
hope to approximate the optimal social welfare any better than the
approximation given by assigning the item to a random bidder. Consequently, we
introduce a relaxed version of single-crossing, {\sl $c$-single-crossing},
parameterized by $c\geq 1$, which means that the impact of $s_i$ on the
valuation of agent $i$ is at least $1/c$ times the impact of $s_i$ on the
valuation of any other agent ($c=1$ is single-crossing). Using this
parameterized notion, we obtain a host of positive results.
  We propose a prior-free deterministic mechanism that gives an
$(n-1)c$-approximation guarantee to welfare. We then show that a random version
of the proposed mechanism gives a prior-free universally truthful
$2c$-approximation to the optimal welfare for any concave $c$-single crossing
setting (and a $2\sqrt{n}c^{3/2}$-approximation in the absence of concavity).
We extend this mechanism to a universally truthful mechanism that gives
$O(c^2)$-approximation to the optimal revenue.

NGC 253 is one of only two starburst galaxies found to
emit $\gamma$-rays from hundreds of MeV to multi-TeV energies. Accurate
measurements of the very-high-energy (VHE) (E $>$ 100 GeV) and high-energy (HE)
(E $>$ 60 MeV) spectra are crucial to study the underlying particle
accelerators and cosmic-ray interaction and transport.
  Aims. The measurement of the VHE $\gamma$-ray emission of NGC 253 published
in 2012 by H.E.S.S. was limited by large systematic uncertainties. Here, a
measurement of the $\gamma$-ray spectrum of NGC 253 is investigated in both HE
and VHE $\gamma$-rays.
  Methods. The data of H.E.S.S. observations are reanalysed using an updated
calibration and analysis chain. The $Fermi$-LAT analysis employs more than 8
years of data processed using pass 8. The cosmic-ray particle population is
evaluated from the combined HE--VHE $\gamma$-ray spectrum using NAIMA.
  Results. The VHE $\gamma$-ray energy spectrum is best fit by a power-law with
a flux normalisation of
$(1.34\,\pm\,0.14^{\mathrm{stat}}\,\pm\,0.27^{\mathrm{sys}}) \times 10^{-13}
\mathrm{cm^{-2} s^{-1} TeV^{-1}}$ at 1 TeV -- about 40 \% above, but compatible
with the value obtained in Abramowski et al. (2012). The spectral index $\Gamma
= 2.39 \pm 0.14^{\mathrm{stat}} \pm 0.25^{\mathrm{sys}}$ is slightly softer
than but consistent with the previous measurement. At energies above $\sim$3
GeV the HE spectrum is consistent with a power-law ranging into the VHE part of
the spectrum measured by H.E.S.S.
  Conclusions. Two scenarios for the starburst nucleus are tested, in which the
gas in the starburst nucleus acts as a target for hadronic cosmic rays. In
these two models, the level to which NGC\,253 acts as a calorimeter is
estimated to a range of $f_{\rm cal} = 0.1$ to $1$ while accounting for the
measurement uncertainties.

$\varphi(s\upharpoonright \xi)=f_\alpha(\xi)$. In sharp contrast to the
classical theory of uniformizations on $\omega_1$, J. Moore proved that CH is
consistent with the statement that any ladder system colouring has a
$T$-uniformization (for any Aronszajn tree $T$). Our goal is to present a fine
analysis of ladder system uniformization on trees pointing out the analogies
and differences between the classical and this new theory. We show that if $S$
is a Suslin tree then (i) CH implies that there is a ladder system colouring
without $S$-uniformization; (ii) the restricted forcing axiom $MA(S)$ implies
that any ladder system colouring has an $\omega_1$-uniformization. For an
arbitrary Aronszajn tree $T$, we show how diamond-type assumptions affect the
existence of ladder system colourings without a $T$-uniformization.
Furthermore, it is consistent that for any Aronszajn tree $T$ and ladder system
$\mathbf C$ there is a colouring of $\mathbf C$ without a $T$-uniformization;
however, and quite surprisingly, $\diamondsuit^+$ implies that for any ladder
system $\mathbf C$ there is an Aronszajn tree $T$ so that any monochromatic
colouring of $\mathbf C$ has a $T$-uniformization. We also prove positive
uniformization results in ZFC for some well-studied trees of size continuum,

minimum mass $m_c \sin i_c = 2.64\pm0.44~M_\oplus$. Receiving about 1.9 times
more flux than Earth in our solar system, its equilibrium temperature is that
of a temperate planet ($T_{eq}=230-300$ K for albedos $A=0.75-0.00$) and places
GJ1132c near the inner edge of the so-called habitable zone. Despite an a

timescales. However, most experimental and modeling studies of decision-making
focus on sequences of independent trials. On the other hand, natural
environments are characterized by long temporal correlations, and evidence used
to make a present choice is often relevant to future decisions. To understand
decision-making under these conditions we analyze how a model ideal observer
accumulates evidence to freely make choices across a sequence of correlated
trials. We use principles of probabilistic inference to show that an ideal
observer incorporates information obtained on one trial as an initial bias on
the next. This bias decreases the time, but not the accuracy of the next
decision. Furthermore, in finite sequences of trials the rate of reward is
maximized when the observer deliberates longer for early decisions, but
responds more quickly towards the end of the sequence. Our model also explains
experimentally observed patterns in decision times and choices, thus providing
a mathematically principled foundation for evidence-accumulation models of
sequential decisions.

that, the first two terms are the well-known TID and injection annealing

often on contrast edges. However, the primate visual system contains a large
number of cells that are insensitive to spatial contrast and, instead, respond
to uniform homogeneous illumination of their visual field. The purpose of this
information remains unclear. Here, we propose a mechanism that detects feature
homogeneity in visual areas, based on latency coding and spike time
coincidence, in a purely feed-forward and therefore rapid manner. We
demonstrate how homogeneity information can interact with information on
contrast edges to potentially support rapid image segmentation. Furthermore, we
analyze how neuronal crosstalk (noise) affects the mechanism's performance. We
show that the detrimental effects of crosstalk can be partly mitigated through
delayed feed-forward inhibition that shapes bi-phasic post-synaptic events. The
delay of the feed-forward inhibition allows effectively controlling the size of
the temporal integration window and, thereby, the coincidence threshold. The
proposed model is based on single-spike latency codes in a purely feed-forward
architecture that supports low-latency processing, making it an attractive
scheme of computation in spiking neuronal networks where rapid responses and
low spike counts are desired.

of 2 days and SRTs of 10 and 5 days (PSBR2-10 and PSBR2-5, respectively),
whereas the semi-continuous reactor was operated at a coupled HRT/SRT of 10

were able to produce biomass up to 0.09 g L-1 d-1, more than twofold the
biomass produced by the semi-continuous reactor (0.04 g L-1 d-1), and achieved
a biomass settleability of 86-92%. This study also demonstrated that the
microbial composition could be controlled by the nutrients loads, since the
three reactors were dominated by different species depending on the nutritional
conditions. Concerning biopolymers accumulation, carbohydrates concentration
achieved similar values in the three reactors (11%), whereas <0.5 % of
polyhydrohybutyrates (PHB) was produced. These low values in biopolymers
production could be related to the lack of microorganisms as cyanobacteria that

In electricity markets, seasonality comes naturally into play and have to be
captured by the used models. The model class studied in this work extends
existing models, for example Sato processes and time-inhomogeneous affine

of dynamics across time scales remains a challenge. One framework to study such
dynamics is that of fractal geometry. However, currently there exists no
established method for the study of brain dynamics using fractal geometry, due
to the many challenges in the conceptual and technical understanding of the
methods. We aim to highlight some of the practical challenges of applying
fractal geometry to brain dynamics and propose solutions to enable its wider
use in neuroscience. Using intracranially recorded EEG and simulated data, we
compared monofractal and multifractal methods with regards to their sensitivity
to signal variance. We found that both correlate closely with signal variance,
thus not offering new information about the signal. However, after applying an
epoch-wise standardisation procedure to the signal, we found that multifractal
measures could offer non-redundant information compared to signal variance,
power and other established EEG signal measures. We also compared different
multifractal estimation methods and found that the Chhabra-Jensen algorithm
performed best. Finally, we investigated the impact of sampling frequency and
epoch length on multifractal properties. Using epileptic seizures as an example
event in the EEG, we show that there may be an optimal time scale for detecting
temporal changes in multifractal properties around seizures. The practical
issues we highlighted and our suggested solutions should help in developing a
robust method for the application of fractal geometry in EEG signals. Our
analyses and observations also aid the theoretical understanding of the
multifractal properties of the brain and might provide grounds for new
discoveries in the study of brain signals. These could be crucial for
understanding of neurological function and for the developments of new

Most existing methods are, however, for single isolated object instances, while
some recent methods tackle crowd scenarios as post-refinement which accounts
multiple object relations. In this paper, we address recovering 6D poses of
multiple instances in bin-picking scenarios in depth modality by multi-task
learning in deep neural networks. Our architecture jointly learns multiple
sub-tasks: 2D detection, depth, and 3D pose estimation of individual objects;
and joint registration of multiple objects. For training data generation, depth
images of physically plausible object pose configurations are generated by a 3D
object model in a physics simulation, which yields diverse occlusion patterns
to learn. We adopt a state-of-the-art object detector, and 2D offsets are
further estimated via a network to refine misaligned 2D detections. The depth

detection. This allows the joint registration network to learn occlusion
patterns and remove physically implausible pose hypotheses. We apply our
architecture on both synthetic (our own and Sileane dataset) and real (a public

structures in protoplanetary disks and their role in the planet formation

vortices and zonal flows - are a consequence of weak magneto and hydrodynamic
instabilities in the pressure and entropy stratified quasi-Keplerian shear flow
interacting with the fast rotation of the disk. The vortices and zonal flows on
the other hand are particle traps tapping into the radial pebble flux of the
disk, leading to locally sufficient accumulations to trigger gravitational
collapse, directly converting pebbles to many kilometer sized planetesimals.
This collapse is moderated by the streaming instability, which is a
back-reaction from the particle accumulations onto the gas flow. Without
trapping pebbles and increasing thus the local solid to gas ratio, this
back-reaction would ultimately prevent the formation of planetsimals via
turbulent diffusion. The formation of long lived flow structures is therefore a
necessary condition for an efficient and fast formation of planetesimals.

present article, we first propose an improved numerical implementation to speed
up the uncertainties estimation. Then, we conduct two synthetic studies about
photometric measurements in order to analyze the influence of observation
geometry:
  First, we introduce the concept of ""efficiency"" of a set of geometries to
sample the photometric behavior. A set of angular sampling elements (noted as
geometry) is efficient if the retrieved Hapke parameters are close to the
expected ones. We compared different geometries and found that the principal
plane with high incidence is the most efficient geometry among the tested ones.
In particular, such geometries are better than poorly sampled full BRDF.
  Second, we test the analysis scheme of a collection of photometric data
acquired from various locations in order to answer the question: are these
locations photometrically homogeneous or not? For instance, this question
arises when combining data from an entire planetary body, where each spatial
position is sampled at a single geometry. We tested the ability of the Bayesian
method to decipher two situations, in the presence of noise: (i) a
photometrically homogeneous surface (all observations with the same photometric
behavior), or (ii) an heterogeneous surface with two distinct photometrical
properties (half observations with photometric behavior 1, other half with
photometric behavior 2). We show that the naive interpretation of the results
provided by Bayesian method is not able to solve this problem.

systems, in which different quantum resonators are strongly coupled. Prominent
examples are circular resonators with high quality factors that allow the
coupling of optical whispering gallery modes to microwave cavities or magnon
resonances in optomagnonics. Whispering gallery modes play a special role in
this endeavour because of their high quality factor and strong localisation,
which ultimately increases the overlap of the wavefunctions of quantum
particles in hybridised systems. The hybridisation with magnons, the collective
quantum excitations of the electron spins in a magnetically ordered material,
is of particular interest because magnons can take over two functionalities:
due to their collective nature they are robust and can serve as a quantum
memory and, moreover, they can act as a wavelength converter between microwave
and THz photons. However, the observation of whispering gallery magnons has not
yet been achieved due to the lack of efficient excitation schemes for magnons
with large wave vectors in a circular geometry. To tackle this problem, we
studied nonlinear 3-magnon scattering as a means to generate whispering gallery
magnons. This Letter discusses the basics of this nonlinear mechanism in a
confined, circular geometry from experimental and theoretical point of view.

hundreds of kilometers apart, are synchronized at a few nanoseconds level via a
clock signal delivered by the Global Positioning System. The data collected

practice, CAs' absolute responsibility for providing trustworthiness caused
major security and privacy issues. To prevent such issues, Google introduced
the concept of Certificate Transparency (CT) in 2013. Later, several new PKI
models (e.g., AKI, ARPKI, and DTKI) are proposed to reduce the level of trust
to the CAs. However, all of these proposals are still vulnerable to split-world

the targeted victims. In this paper, we propose a new PKI architecture with
certificate transparency based on blockchain, what we called CertLedger, to
eliminate the split-world attacks and to provide an ideal
certificate/revocation transparency. All TLS certificates, their revocation
status, entire revocation process, and trusted CA management are conducted in
the CertLedger. CertLedger provides a unique, efficient, and trustworthy
certificate validation process eliminating the conventional inadequate and
incompatible certificate validation processes implemented by different software
vendors. TLS clients in the CertLedger also do not require to make certificate
validation and store the trusted CA certificates anymore. We analyze the
security and performance of the CertLedger and provide a comparison with the

that may explain the special stability of the H-SCO phase and the reversibility

While weak convergence of the iterates to a solution has been established,

this end, there are three main contributions. First, in the context of convex

Second, for strongly monotone inclusions, strong convergence is established as

iterates to the solution. Finally, for inclusions featuring strong monotonicity

Volterra integral, whose solution directly provides the desired solution of the

equation is not in a standard form of partial differential equations. We employ
the quasi-reversibility method to find its regularized solution. Using Carleman
estimates, we show that the obtained regularized solution converges to the
exact solution with the Lipschitz-like convergence rate as the measurement
noise tends to 0. This is one of the novelties of this paper since currently,
convergence results for the quasi-reversibility method are only valid for

lead to an initial loss of circulation $\Gamma$ and attempt to derive scaling
laws for the loss of circulation as a function of field strength and diffusion
as measured by two non-dimensional parameters. We show that for all cases the
loss of circulation depends on the integrated effects of the Lorentz force,
with the patch cases leading to significantly greater circulation loss. For the
case of the elliptical vortex the loss of circulation depends on the total area
swept out by the rotating vortex and so this leads to more efficient
circulation loss than for a circular vortex.

$\rho\sim T^2$ and an anomalous non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behaviour with $\rho

regions were prepared for the investigated materials. Then, the experimental
behaviour of $C/T$ and $\rho(T)$ were compared with predictions of the
self-consistent renormalization (SCR) theory of spin fluctuations. Within this
approach, $C/T(T)$ was well described up to 20 K. The SCR parameters $y_0$,
$y_1$ and $T_0$ inferred from specific heat analysis allowed to describe
properly $\rho(T)$ up to approximately 5 K. In addition, the resistivity data
were analysed within the `hidden Fermi liquid' theory of Anderson, obtaining
very good descritption of the experimental behaviour up to about 25 K. An
anomalous increase of the $C/T$ ratio already in the LFL region below 2 K in
very weak magnetic fields (0.2--0.3 T) was identified as caused by the Schottky

we perform entropic analysis of the quantum Hubble horizon and show that the
$\Lambda$CDM model may arise from linearly (in area of the horizon) corrected
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Based on this, we have shown that the current
accelerating expansion can be associated with the entropy decrease in the
Hubble volume. The presented results open new ways to explore relation between
the Planck scale effects and observationally relevant features of our Universe.

analysed single units to determine if this assumption is correct. However,
recent results from psychology, neuroscience and computer science have shown
the occasional existence of local codes emerging in artificial and biological
neural networks. In this paper, we undertake the first systematic survey of
when local codes emerge in a feed-forward neural network, using generated input
and output data with known qualities. We find that the number of local codes
that emerge from a NN follows a well-defined distribution across the number of
hidden layer neurons, with a peak determined by the size of input data, number
of examples presented and the sparsity of input data. Using a 1-hot output code
drastically decreases the number of local codes on the hidden layer. The number
of emergent local codes increases with the percentage of dropout applied to the
hidden layer, suggesting that the localist encoding may offer a resilience to
noisy networks. This data suggests that localist coding can emerge from
feed-forward PDP networks and suggests some of the conditions that may lead to
interpretable localist representations in the cortex. The findings highlight
how local codes should not be dismissed out of hand.

quantum fields in a regime where the wave-vectors involved in the particle

and the symmetries of special relativity can be resolved by rethinking the
notion of a change of inertial reference frame. We give here a definition of
the latter that avoids a pre-defined space-time geometry, in terms of a change
of values of the constants of motion that leaves the walk operator unchanged.
Starting from the family of 1+1 dimensional Dirac quantum walks with all
possible values of the mass parameter, we introduce a unique walk encompassing
the latter as an extra degree of freedom, and we derive its group of changes of
inertial frames. This symmetry group contains a non linear realization of
$SO^+(2,1)

correspond to an actual spatial degree of freedom but rather the mass, we

also a non-linear realisation of the proper orthochronous Poincar\'e group
$SO^+(1,1) \ltimes \mathbb{R}^2$ in 1+1 dimension, as the ones considered
within the framework of doubly special relativity, which recovers the usual
relativistic symmetry of the Dirac Equation in the limit of small wave-vectors
and masses. Surprisingly, if one considers the Dirac walk with a fixed value of
the mass parameter, the group of allowed changes of reference frame does not
have a consistent interpretation in the relativistic limit of small
wave-vectors.

that originates from the Earth and planetary sciences. Such methods are very
time-consuming and by necessity there is a compromise between physical and
chemical realism versus computational feasibility. Machine learning has
previously been used to determine which molecules to include in the model, but
the retrieval itself was still performed using standard methods. Here, we
report an adaptation of the random forest method of supervised machine
learning, trained on a pre-computed grid of atmospheric models, which retrieves
full posterior distributions of the abundances of molecules and the cloud
opacity. The use of a pre-computed grid allows a large part of the
computational burden to be shifted offline. We demonstrate our technique on a

five-parameter model (temperature, a constant cloud opacity and the volume
mixing ratios or relative abundance by number of water, ammonia and hydrogen
cyanide). We obtain results consistent with the standard nested-sampling
retrieval method. Additionally, we can estimate the sensitivity of the measured
spectrum to constraining the model parameters and we can quantify the
information content of the spectrum. Our method can be straightforwardly
applied using more sophisticated atmospheric models and also to interpreting an

Mahalanobis metric learning methods that map both query (unlabeled) objects and

learns a transformation of labeled objects to new points in the feature space
whereas query objects are kept in their original coordinates. This method has
several advantages over existing distance metric learning methods: (i) In
experiments with large document and image datasets, it achieves $k$-NN
classification accuracy better than or at least comparable to the
state-of-the-art metric learning methods. (ii) The transformation can be
learned efficiently by solving a standard ridge regression problem. For
document and image datasets, training is often more than two orders of
magnitude faster than the fastest metric learning methods tested. This speed-up
is also due to the fact that the proposed method eliminates the optimization
over ""negative"" object pairs, i.e., objects whose class labels are different.
(iii) The formulation has a theoretical justification in terms of reducing
hubness in data.

plasma beta and the abundance of suprathermal electrons. Derived in terms of
relative drift velocity the instability thresholds show an inverse correlation
with the core plasma beta for the whistler modes, and a direct correlation with
the core plasma beta for the firehose instability. Suprathermal electrons
reduce the effective (beaming) anisotropy inhibiting the firehose modes while

laser spectral shift from the resultant high harmonic spectral shift in order
to elucidate the microscopic effect of spectral shift in HHG. Therefore, in
some cases we are able to identify the dominant electron trajectory from the

studying the forced behaviour of a large variety of systems - including out of
equilibrium ones. In this paper we provide a new angle on the problem, by
studying under which conditions it is possible to perform predictions on the
response of a given observable of a system to perturbations, using one or more
other observables of the same system as predictors, and thus bypassing the need
to know all the details of the acting forcing. Thus, we break the rigid
separation between forcing and response, which is key in linear response
theory, and revisit the concept of causality. As a result, the surrogate Green
functions one constructs for predicting the response of the observable of
interest may have support that is not necessarily limited to the nonnegative
time axis. This implies that not all observables are equally good as
predictands when a given forcing is applied, as result of the properties of
their corresponding susceptibility. In particular, problems emerge from the
presence of complex zeros. We derive general explicit formulas that, in absence
of such pathologies, allow one to reconstruct the response of an observable of
interest to N independent forcings by using as predictors N other observables.
We provide a thorough test of the theory and of the possible pathologies by
using numerical simulations of the paradigmatic Lorenz '96 model. Our results
are potentially relevant for problems like the reconstruction of data from
proxy signals, like in the case of paleoclimate, and, in general, the analysis
of signals and feedbacks in complex systems where our knowledge on the system
is limited, as in neurosciences. Our technique might also be useful for
reconstructing the response to forcings of a spatially extended system in a
given location by looking at the response in a separate location.

regime is dominated by thermal fluctuations leading to dissipation. Here we
demonstrate the principle of torque transmission for a disc-like colloidal
assembly exhibiting clutch-like behaviour, driven by $27$ particles in optical
traps. These are translated on a circular path to form a rotating boundary that
transmits torque to additional particles confined to the interior. We
investigate this transmission and find that it is determined by solid-like or
fluid-like behaviour of the device and a stick-slip mechanism reminiscent of
macroscopic gearwheels slipping. The transmission behaviour is predominantly
governed by the rotation rate of the boundary and the density of the confined

the generic spatial discretization of the model equations using a continuous
finite element type approximation technique, while avoiding the solution of a
large linear system with a sparse mass matrix which would come along with any
standard ODE solver in a classical finite element approach to advance the
solution in time. In this work, we propose a new Residual Distribution (RD)
scheme, which provides an arbitrary explicit high order approximation of the
smooth solutions of the Euler equations both in space and time. The design of
the scheme via the coupling of the RD formulation \cite{mario,abg} with a
Deferred Correction (DeC) type method \cite{shu-dec,Minion2}, allows to have
the matrix associated to the update in time, which needs to be inverted, to be
diagonal. The use of Bernstein polynomials as shape functions, guarantees that
this diagonal matrix is invertible and ensures strict positivity of the
resulting diagonal matrix coefficients. This work is the extension of
\cite{enumath,Abgrall2017} to multidimensional systems. We have assessed our
method on several challenging benchmark problems for one- and two-dimensional
Euler equations and the scheme has proven to be robust and to achieve the
theoretically predicted high order of accuracy on smooth solutions.

gene families is interconnected. In this paper, we extend a previous approach
to reconcile a set of gene trees with a species tree based on segmental
macro-evolutionary events, where segmental duplication events and losses are
associated with cost $\delta$ and $\lambda$, respectively. We show that the
problem is polynomial-time solvable when $\delta \leq \lambda$ (via
LCA-mapping), while if $\delta > \lambda$ the problem is NP-hard, even when
$\lambda = 0$ and a single gene tree is given, solving a long standing open
problem on the complexity of the reconciliation problem. On the positive side,
we give a fixed-parameter algorithm for the problem, where the parameters are
$\delta/\lambda$ and the number $d$ of segmental duplications, of time
complexity $O(\lceil \frac{\delta}{\lambda} \rceil^{d} \cdot n \cdot

mandate stronger energy sector coupling and the use of energy storage. In such
multi-modal energy systems, it is challenging to determine the effect of an
individual player's consumption pattern onto overall CO$_2$ emissions. This,
however, is often important to evaluate the suitability of local CO$_2$
reduction measures. Due to renewables' volatility, the traditional approach of
using annual average CO$_2$ intensities per energy form is no longer accurate,
but the time of consumption should be considered. Moreover, CO$_2$ intensities
are highly coupled over time and different energy forms due to sector coupling
and energy storage. We introduce and compare two novel methods for computing
time-dependent CO$_2$ intensities, that address different objectives: the first
method determines CO$_2$ intensities of the energy system as is. The second
method analyzes how overall CO$_2$ emissions would change in response to
infinitesimal demand changes. Given a digital twin of the energy system in form
of a linear program, we show how to compute these sensitivities very
efficiently. We present the results of both methods for two simulated test
energy systems and discuss their different implications.

the magnet current directly displaces the betatron tune from its designated

when the $\ell_2$-norm of the oracle filter is small enough, such oracle can be
""mimicked"" by an efficiently computable adaptive estimate of the same structure

solution to the optimization problem in which the $\ell_\infty$-norm of the
Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the estimation residual is minimized under

networks. Empirically measured networks and dynamic processes that take place
in these situations show heterogeneous, non-Markovian, and intrinsically
correlated topologies and dynamics. This makes their analysis particularly
challenging. Randomized reference models (RRMs) have emerged as a general and
versatile toolbox for studying such systems. Defined as random networks with
given features constrained to match those of an input (empirical) network, they
may, for example, be used to identify important features of empirical networks
and their effects on dynamical processes unfolding in the network. RRMs are
typically implemented as procedures that reshuffle an empirical network, making
them very generally applicable. However, the effects of most shuffling
procedures on network features remain poorly understood, rendering their use
nontrivial and susceptible to misinterpretation. Here we propose a unified
framework for classifying and understanding microcanonical RRMs (MRRMs) that
sample networks with uniform probability. Focusing on temporal networks, we
survey applications of MRRMs found in the literature, and we use this framework
to build a taxonomy of MRRMs that proposes a canonical naming convention,
classifies them, and deduces their effects on a range of important network
features. We furthermore show that certain classes of MRRMs may be applied in
sequential composition to generate new MRRMs from the existing ones surveyed in
this article. We finally provide a tutorial showing how to apply a series of
MRRMs to analyze how different network features affect a dynamic process in an
empirical temporal network.

is optimal from her perspective. We show that in this case, the quality of the
matching dramatically improves from the other women's perspective. When running
the Gale--Shapley men-proposing algorithm, the expected women-rank is $O(\log^4
n)$ and almost surely the average women-rank is $O(\log^{2+\epsilon}n)$, rather
than a rank of $O(\frac{n}{\log n})$ in both cases under a truthful regime. On
the other hand, almost surely, the average men's rank is no better than
$\Omega\left(\frac{n}{\log^{2+\epsilon}n}\right)$, compared to a rank of

tasks. Nonetheless, robot security is being underestimated. Robotics security
is a complex landscape, which often requires a cross-disciplinar perspective to
which classical security lags behind. To address this issue, we present the
Robot Security Framework (RSF), a methodology to perform systematic security
assessments in robots. We propose, adapt and develop specific terminology and
provide guidelines to enable a holistic security assessment following four main
layers (Physical, Network, Firmware and Application). We argue that modern
robotics should regard as equally relevant internal and external communication
security. Finally, we advocate against ""security by obscurity"". We conclude
that the field of security in robotics deserves further research efforts.

main resource in quantum information science. Ground states of quantum
many-body systems with local interactions typically obey an ""area law"" meaning
the entanglement entropy proportional to the boundary length. It is exceptional
when the system is gapless, and the area law had been believed to be violated
by at most a logarithm for over two decades. Recent discovery of Motzkin and
Fredkin spin chain models is striking, since these models provide significant
violation of the entanglement beyond the belief, growing as a square root of
the volume in spite of local interactions. Although importance of intensive
study of the models is undoubted to reveal novel features of quantum
entanglement, it is still far from their complete understanding. In this
article, we first analytically compute the Renyi entropy of the Motzkin and
Fredkin models by careful treatment of asymptotic analysis. The Renyi entropy
is an important quantity, since the whole spectrum of an entangled subsystem is
reconstructed once the Renyi entropy is known as a function of its parameter.
We find non-analytic behavior of the Renyi entropy with respect to the
parameter, which is a novel phase transition never seen in any other spin chain
studied so far. Interestingly, similar behavior is seen in the Renyi entropy of
Rokhsar-Kivelson states in two-dimensions.

molecular cloud is presented. A complete gas-grain chemical network is taken
into account: the gas-phase chemistry, the adsorption of gas species on dust
grains, various desorption mechanisms, the grain surface chemistry, the ion
neutralization on dust grains, the sputtering of grain mantles. The population
densities of energy levels of ions CI, CII and OI and molecules H$_2$, CO,
H$_2$O are computed in parallel with the dynamical and chemical rate equations.
The large velocity gradient approximation is used in the line radiative
transfer calculations. The simulations consist of two steps: (i) modelling of
the chemical and thermal evolution of a static molecular cloud and (ii) shock
simulations. A comparison is made with the results of publicly available models
of similar physical systems.
  The focus of the paper is on the chemical processing of gas material and ice
mantles of dust grains by the shock. Sputtering of ice mantles takes place in
the shock region close to the temperature peak of the neutral gas. At high
shock speeds, molecules ejected from ice mantles are effectively destroyed in
hot gas, and their survival time is low - of the order of dozens of years.
After a passage of high-speed C-type shock, a zone of high abundance of atomic
hydrogen appears in the cooling postshock gas that triggers formation of
complex organic species such as methanol. It is shown that abundances of some
complex organic molecules (COMs) in the postshock region can be much higher
than in the preshock gas. These results are important for interpretation of
observations of COMs in protostellar outflows.

systems. This challenge is especially acute within the medical image domain,
particularly when pathologies are involved, due to two factors: 1) limited

this work, we investigate whether augmenting a dataset with artificially
generated lung nodules can improve the robustness of the progressive
holistically nested network (P-HNN) model for pathological lung segmentation of
CT scans. To achieve this goal, we develop a 3D generative adversarial network
(GAN) that effectively learns lung nodule property distributions in 3D space.
In order to embed the nodules within their background context, we condition the
GAN based on a volume of interest whose central part containing the nodule has
been erased. To further improve realism and blending with the background, we
propose a novel multi-mask reconstruction loss. We train our method on over
1000 nodules from the LIDC dataset. Qualitative results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method compared to the state-of-art. We then use our GAN
to generate simulated training images where nodules lie on the lung border,
which are cases where the published P-HNN model struggles. Qualitative and
quantitative results demonstrate that armed with these simulated images, the
P-HNN model learns to better segment lung regions under these challenging
situations. As a result, our system provides a promising means to help overcome
the data paucity that commonly afflicts medical imaging.

preferred, particularly under high atmospheric noise, which is usually the case

analog components appear. We describe a method to correct these imbalances
without making any change in the analog part of the sideband-separating
receiver, specifically, keeping the intermediate-frequency hybrid in place.
This opens the possibility of implementing the method in any existing receiver.
We have built hardware to demonstrate the validity of the method and tested it
on a fully analog receiver operating between 600 and 720GHz. We have tested the
stability of calibration and performance vs time and after full resets of the
receiver. We have performed an error analysis to compare the digital
compensation in two configurations of analog receivers, with and without
intermediate frequency (IF) hybrid. An average compensated sideband rejection
ratio of 46dB is obtained. Degradation of the compensated sideband rejection
ratio on time and after several resets of the receiver is minimal. A receiver
with an IF hybrid is more robust to systematic errors. Moreover, we have shown
that the intrinsic random errors in calibration have the same impact for
configuration without IF hybrid and for a configuration with IF hybrid with
analog rejection ratio better than 10dB. Compensated rejection ratios above
40dB are obtained even in the presence of high analog rejection. The method is
robust allowing its use under normal operational conditions at any telescope.
We also demonstrate that a full analog receiver is more robust against
systematic errors. Finally, the error bars associated to the compensated
rejection ratio are almost independent of whether IF hybrid is present or not.

enables to recruit mobile users based on their locations, and select proper

on the flux density of any such source of $31\,\mu$Jy at 1.4~GHz and
$21\,\mu$Jy at 3~GHz. Four candidate transient events were detected with
greater than $7\sigma$ significance, with dispersion measures (DMs) in the
range 150 to 840\,cm$^{-3}\,$pc. For two of them, we found a second pulse at
slightly lower significance. However, we cannot at present conclude that any of
these are associated with a pulsar in SNR~1987A. As a check on the system, we
also observed PSR~B0540$-$69, a young pulsar which also lies in the LMC. We
found eight giant pulses at the DM of this pulsar. We discuss the implications

numerical simulations of systems with one viscoelastic and one Newtonian phase.
A complete set of governing equations is derived by conditional
volume-averaging of the local instantaneous bulk equations and interface jump
conditions. The homogeneous mixture model is applied for the closure of the
volume-averaged equations. An additional interfacial stress term arises in this
volume-averaged formulation which requires special treatment in the
finite-volume discretization on a general unstructured mesh. A novel numerical
scheme is proposed for the second-order accurate finite-volume discretization
of the interface stress term. We demonstrate that this scheme allows for a
consistent treatment of the interface stress and the surface tension force in
the pressure equation of the segregated solution approach. Because of the high
Weissenberg number problem, an appropriate stabilization approach is applied to
the constitutive equation of the viscoelastic phase to increase the robustness
of the method at higher fluid elasticity. Direct numerical simulations of the
transient motion of a bubble rising in a quiescent viscoelastic fluid are
performed for the purpose of experimental code validation. The well-known jump
discontinuity in the terminal bubble rise velocity when the bubble volume
exceeds a critical value is captured by the method. The formulation of the
interfacial stress together with the novel scheme for its discretization is
found crucial for the quantitatively correct prediction of the jump
discontinuity in the terminal bubble rise velocity.

learned by optimizing the segmentation branch and the motion estimation branch

delivery. User mobility is an important factor when investigating such
networks, which unfortunately was largely ignored in most previous works.
Preliminary studies have been carried out, but the effect of mobility on the
caching performance has not been fully understood. In this paper, by explicitly
considering users' contact and inter-contact durations via an alternating
renewal process, we first investigate the effect of mobility with a given cache
placement. A tractable expression of the data offloading ratio, i.e., the
proportion of requested data that can be delivered via D2D links, is derived,
which is proved to be increasing with the user moving speed. The analytical
results are then used to develop an effective mobility-aware caching strategy
to maximize the data offloading ratio. Simulation results are provided to
confirm the accuracy of the analytical results and also validate the effect of
user mobility. Performance gains of the proposed mobility-aware caching
strategy are demonstrated with both stochastic models and real-life data sets.
It is observed that the information of the contact durations is critical to
design cache placement, especially when they are relatively short or comparable
to the inter-contact durations.

and often also significantly better finite-sample performance. We also prove
new results related to misspecifying the mean or covariance structures, and
give tighter rates for certain non-local priors than currently available.

relied on imaging unstained tissues, which disrupts the established specimen
processing. Here we present color spatial light interference microscopy (cSLIM)

with a color detector array. As a result, cSLIM yields in a single scan both
the intrinsic tissue phase map and the standard color bright-field image,
familiar to the pathologist. Our results on 196 breast cancer patients indicate
that cSLIM can provide not only diagnostic but also prognostic information from
the alignment of collagen fibers in the tumor microenvironment. The effects of
staining on the tissue phase maps were corrected by a simple mathematical
normalization. These characteristics are likely to reduce barriers to clinical

patients treated with the CERAB technique for AIOD were identified in the local
databases of two centers and analyzed. Demographics and lesion characteristics
were scored. Follow-up (FU) consisted of clinical assessment, duplex ultrasound
and ankle brachial indices (ABI). Patency rates and clinically driven target

Results: 130 patients (69 male and 61 female) were treated of which 68%
patients were diagnosed with intermittent claudication and 32% suffered from
critical limb ischemia. The vast majority (89%) were TASC-II D lesions and the
remaining were TASC-II B and C (both 5%). Median follow-up was 24 months (range

30-day minor and major complication rate was 33% and 7%. The median hospital
stay was 2 days (range 1-76 days). At 1 and 3-years FU 94% and 96% of the
patients clinically improved at least 1 Rutherford category (2% and 0%
unchanged, 4% and 4% worsened). Limb salvage rate at 1-year was 98% and 97% at

86%/91%/97% at 1-year, 84%/89%/97% at 2-year and 82%/87%/97% at 3-year FU.
Freedom from CD-TLR was 87% at 1-year and 86% at both 2 and 3-year FU.
Conclusions:The CERAB technique is a safe and feasible technique for the
treatment of extensive aortoiliac occlusive disease with good three year

novel insights into development and the principles that orchestrate the
developmental processes. This chapter focusses on the mathematical description
and numerical simulation of developmental processes. In particular, we discuss
the mathematical representation of morphogen and tissue dynamics on static and
grow- ing domains, as well as the corresponding tissue mechanics. In addition,
we give an overview of numerical methods that are routinely used to solve the
resulting systems of partial differential equations. These include the finite
element method and the Lattice Boltzmann method for the discretisation as well
as the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method and the Diffuse-Domain method to
numerically treat deforming domains.

exact closure terms including the discretization operators and generate
training data from direct numerical simulations of decaying homogeneous
isotropic turbulence. We design and train artificial neural networks based on
local convolution filters to predict the underlying unknown non-linear mapping
from the coarse grid quantities to the closure terms without a priori
assumptions. All investigated networks are able to generalize from the data and
learn approximations with a cross correlation of up to 47% and even 73% for the
inner elements, leading to the conclusion that the current training success is
data-bound. We further show that selecting both the coarse grid primitive
variables as well as the coarse grid LES operator as input features
significantly improves training results. Finally, we construct a stable and
accurate LES model from the learned closure terms. Therefore, we translate the
model predictions into a data-adaptive, pointwise eddy viscosity closure and
show that the resulting LES scheme performs well compared to current state of
the art approaches. This work represents the starting point for further
research into data-driven, universal turbulence models.

galaxies. Specifically, the shape and morphology of local stellar haloes have
encoded in them the early formation history of their parent galaxies. Early
progenitor galaxies were absorbed by the dark halo and scattered their stars in
a diffuse halo around the main galaxy. If the accretion event was relatively
recent, it may show as a coherent stream of stars within the halo. in addition,
the low-mass, low-surface brightness satellite galaxies, perhaps the
ultradiffuse galaxies recently reported would help solve the ""Missing Dwarf
Problem"", the apparent over-prediction of $\Lambda$CDM models of the number of
satellite galaxies around a Milky Way Halo.
  However low surface brightness is not what most telescopes are optimized for,
most are best for resolving point sources and not sensitivity for large-scale
low-light. To be sensitive to the low surface brightness Universe, a telescope
needs a simple, unobstructed light path (disfavoring mirrors), fast optics (low
f/D), and relatively coarse sampling (big pixels). Exceptions are the superb
Dragonfly and Huntsman telescopes which are purposely designed to be sensitive
to low surface brighnesses. Similarly designed, if not with low surface
brightness in mind is the successfully launched TESS satellite. We show in this
Research Note that the envisaged total exposure times and optical setup are
near-ideal for low surface brightness work in the local Universe.
  With combined TESS imaging, one can model the stellar halo surrounding a
galaxy. Technical challenges include the image quality, zodiacal and Galactic
cirrus background light, PSF characterization and subtraction. Once accounted
for with a processing pipeline, one can model the stellar halo for all nearby
galaxies and to search for substructure in these haloes.

the vacuum region surrounding the Sun by its electromagnetic parameters.
Starting with Maxwell's equations, we show how the deflection of light passing
the Sun depends on the electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability of
the interior of the Sun. The electromagnetic field equations in Cartesian
coordinates are transformed to the ones in an appropriately chosen Riemannian
space. This coordinate transform is dictated by the introduction of a
refractional potential. The geodetic lines with the shortest propagation time
are constructed from this potential. As far as the deflection of light
propagating along these geodetic lines is concerned, we show that the existence
of a refractional potential influences the light path outside any object with a
typical refractive index. Our results add new aspects to the bending of star
light explained by general relativity. Some astrophysical observations, which
cannot be explained by gravity in a satisfactory manner, are justified by the
electromagnetic model. In particular, the frequency dependency of the light
deflection is discussed. We show that the additional bending due to the
refractive index is proportional to the third power of the inverse distance.
The general relativity predicts that the bending due to the mass is
proportional to the inverse distance.

far only been possible through the use of cryogenically cooled superconducting
mixers as frequency downconverters. Here we introduce a spectrometry scheme
that uses plasmonic photomixing for frequency downconversion to offer
quantum-level sensitivities at room temperature for the first time. Frequency
downconversion is achieved by mixing terahertz radiation and a heterodyning
optical beam with a terahertz beat frequency in a plasmonics-enhanced
semiconductor active region. We demonstrate spectrometer sensitivities down to
3 times the quantum-limit at room temperature. With a versatile design capable
of broadband spectrometry, this plasmonic photomixer has broad applicability to
quantum optics, chemical sensing, biological studies, medical diagnosis, high
data-rate communication, as well as astronomy and atmospheric studies.

explicitly due to its infinitely many axioms, and it has a countable model due
to the L\""{o}wenheim-Skolem theorem. This paper presents the axioms one has to
accept to get rid of these two features. For that matter, some twenty axioms
are formulated in a nonstandard first-order language with countable many
constants: to this collection of axioms is associated a universe of discourse
consisting of a class of objects, each of which is a set, and a class of
arrows, each of which is a function. The axioms of ZF are derived from this
finite axiom scheme, and it is shown that it does not have a countable
model--if it has a model at all, that is. Furthermore, the axioms of category
theory are proven to hold: the present universe may therefore serve as an
ontological basis for category theory. However, it has not been investigated
whether any of the soundness and completeness properties hold for the present

establish whether the present results indeed constitute an advancement in the

organizations intending to implement combined private and public cloud
applications, in order to meet their profitability requirements. However, this
can only be achieved through the utilization of available resources while
speeding up execution processes. Accordingly, deploying new applications
entails dedicating some of these processes to a private cloud solution, while
allocating others to the public cloud. In this context, the present work is set
to help minimize relevant costs and deliver effective choices for an optimal
service placement solution within minimal execution time. Several evolutionary
algorithms have been applied to solve the service placement problem and are
used when dealing with complex solution spaces to provide an optimal placement
and often produce a short execution time. The standard BPSO algorithm is found
to display a significant disadvantage, namely, of easily trapping into local
optima, in addition to demonstrating a noticeable lack of robustness in dealing
with service placement problems. Hence, to overcome critical shortcomings
associated with the standard BPSO, an Enhanced Binary Particle Swarm

the particle position updating equation, initially inspired from the continuous
PSO. Our proposed E-BPSO algorithm is shown to outperform state-of-the-art

to severely degrade performance on previous tasks. One way to lessen the impact
of the forgetting problem is to constrain parameters that are important to
previous tasks to stay close to the optimal parameters. Recently, multiple
competitive approaches for computing the importance of the parameters with

another neural network to predict parameter update steps that respect the

is the limited capacity of the methods; in particular, the traditional
machine-learning methods like SVM may not extract high-level features well to
distinguish between turn or non-turn. Hence, it is worthwhile exploring new
machine-learning methods for the prediction. A cutting-edge deep neural
network, named Capsule Network (CapsuleNet), provides a new opportunity for

auxetics have potential for applications in areas from aerospace to biomedical
industries.[3,4] Existing synthetic auxetics are all created by carefully
structuring porous geometries from positive PR materials. Crucially, their
geometry causes the auxeticity.[3,4] The necessary porosity weakens the
material compared to the bulk and the structure must be engineered, for
example, by using resource-intensive additive manufacturing processes.[1,5] A
longstanding goal for researchers has been the development of a synthetic
material that has intrinsic auxetic behaviour. Such ""molecular auxetics"" would
avoid porosity-weakening and their very existence implies chemical
tuneability.[1,4-9] However molecular auxeticity has never previously been
proven for a synthetic material.[6,7] Here we present a synthetic molecular
auxetic based on a monodomain liquid crystal elastomer (LCE). When stressed
perpendicular to the alignment direction, the LCE becomes auxetic at strains
greater than approximately 0.8 with a minimum PR of -0.8. The critical strain
for auxeticity coincides with the occurrence of a negative liquid crystal order
parameter (LCOP). We show the auxeticity agrees with theoretical predictions
derived from the Warner and Terentjev theory of LCEs.[10] This demonstration of
a synthetic molecular auxetic represents the origin of a new approach to
producing molecular auxetics with a range of physical properties and functional
behaviours. Further, it demonstrates a novel feature of LCEs and a route for
