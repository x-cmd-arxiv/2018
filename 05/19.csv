self--assembly of particle patterns obtained from a nanometric metallic square
grid. Initially, nickel filaments of rectangular cross section are patterned on
a SiO$_2$ flat surface, and then they are melted by laser irradiation with
$\sim 20$ ns pulses. During this time, the liquefied metal dewets the
substrate, leading to a linear array of drops along each side of the squares.
The experimental data provides a series of SEM images of the resultant
morphology as a function of the number of laser pulses or cumulative liquid
lifetime. These data are analyzed in terms of fluid mechanical models that
account for mass conservation and consider flow evolution with the aim to
predict the final number of drops resulting from each side of the square. The
aspect ratio, $\delta$, between the square sides' lengths and their widths is
an essential parameter of the problem. Our models allow us to predict the
$\delta$-intervals within which a certain final number of drops are expected.
The comparison with experimental data shows a good agreement with the model
that explicitly considers the Stokes flow developed in the filaments neck
region that lead to breakup points. Also, numerical simulations, that solve the
Navier-Stokes equations along with slip boundary condition at the contact
lines, are implemented to describe the dynamics of the problem.

infrared-excess young stellar objects (YSOs), and have observed their groups

seen at an interface of the clouds. Considering these observational findings,
we propose the onset of the collision of two clouds in the IRAS site about 1
Myr ago, which triggered the birth of massive star(s) and the YSO groups. A

often to large quartic couplings in the underlying Lagrangian. Therefore, it is
important to check if these couplings are for instance in agreement with

the two-particle scattering matrix of scalars in the large centre-of-mass

show how the allowed regions in the parameter space are affected. In
particular, the light Higgs window with a second Higgs below 125 GeV completely
closes for large values of the $Z_2$ breaking parameter $|M_{12}|$. We also

is now possible to achieve extraordinary control of the properties of
individual photons, introducing tunable gauge fields whilst imbuing the photons

formalizing Rydberg-mediated interactions between propagating photons, we
develop a theory of interacting Rydberg polaritons in multimode optical

single-particle properties to build and probe exotic matter. In the presence of
strong coupling between the resonator field and a Rydberg-dressed atomic
ensemble, a quasiparticle called the ""cavity Rydberg polariton"" emerges. We
investigate its properties, finding that it inherits both the fast dynamics of

polaritons approach each other, and investigate the impact of atomic motion on
the coherence of multi-mode polaritons, showing that most channels for
atom-polariton cross-thermalization are strongly suppressed. Finally, we
propose to harness the repeated diffraction and refocusing of the optical
resonator to realize interactions which are local in momentum space. This work

remains an open question. A key issue is the proportion of the stellar ionizing
radiation that escapes the galaxies in which it is produced. Spectroscopy of
gamma-ray burst afterglows can be used to determine the neutral hydrogen
column-density in their host galaxies and hence the opacity to extreme
ultra-violet radiation along the lines-of-sight to the bursts. Thus, making the
reasonable assumption that long-duration GRB locations are representative of
the sites of massive stars that dominate EUV production, one can calculate an
average escape fraction of ionizing radiation in a way that is independent of
galaxy size, luminosity or underlying spectrum. Here we present a sample of NH
measures for 138 GRBs in the range 1.6<z<6.7 and use it to establish an average
escape fraction at the Lyman limit of <fesc>~0.005, with a 98% confidence upper
limit of ~0.015. This analysis suggests that stars provide a small contribution
to the ionizing radiation budget of the IGM at z<5, where the bulk of the
bursts lie. At higher redshifts, z>5, firm conclusions are limited by the small
size of the GRB sample, but any decline in average HI column-density seems to
be modest. We also find no indication of a significant correlation of NH with
galaxy UV luminosity or host stellar mass, for the subset of events for which
these are available. We discuss in some detail a number of selection effects
and potential biases. Drawing on a range of evidence we argue that such
effects, while not negligible, are unlikely to produce systematic errors of
more than a factor ~2, and so would not affect the primary conclusions. Given
that many GRB hosts are low metallicity, high specific star-formation rate,
dwarf galaxies, these results present a particular problem for the hypothesis
that such galaxies dominated the reionization of the universe.

magnetization is observed at $T_f$ = 50 K, hinting towards an antiferromagnetic

temperature from 6 to 300 K, provides combined information regarding crystal as
well as magnetic structure. Accordingly, an increase in the intensity of the ND
pattern is seen at 150 K, signaling onset of long range FM order. However,
there is no sign of appearance of superlattice reflections corresponding to the
AFM phase, in the patterns recorded below 50 K. An unusual discontinuity in the

low-dimensional feature representations for many machine learning applications.
Current work focuses on either (1) whether the embedding is designed as an

supervised learning of a specific discriminative task in a deep neural network.
In this paper, we focus on bridging the gap of the two lines of the research.
We propose to adapt the Generative Adversarial model to perform network
embedding, in which the generator is trying to generate vertex pairs, while the
discriminator tries to distinguish the generated vertex pairs from real
connections (edges) in the network. Wasserstein-1 distance is adopted to train
the generator to gain better stability. We develop three variations of models,
including GANE which applies cosine similarity, GANE-O1 which preserves the
first-order proximity, and GANE-O2 which tries to preserves the second-order
proximity of the network in the low-dimensional embedded vector space. We later
prove that GANE-O2 has the same objective function as GANE-O1 when negative
sampling is applied to simplify the training process in GANE-O2. Experiments
with real-world network datasets demonstrate that our models constantly

analysis leads to simplified expressions for the optimal power control

stringent QoS constraints and vanishing QoS constraints. In the low power
regime, the energy efficiency (EE) performance with the constant-power scheme
is also determined by characterizing both the minimum energy per bit and
wideband slope for arbitrary input signaling and general fading distributions.
Subsequently, the results are specialized to Nakagami-m and Rician fading
channels. Also, tradeoff between the effective capacity and EE is studied by
determining the optimal power control scheme that maximizes the effective
capacity subject to constraints on the minimum required EE and average
transmission power. Circuit power consumption is explicitly considered in the
EE formulation. Through numerical results, the performance comparison between
constant-power and optimal power control schemes for different signal
constellations and Gaussian signals is carried out. The impact of QoS

can provide the number of layers and nodes of the deep neural network. Namely,
if we have all input and output of a loss function (or equivalently all
possible learning process), for all input of each training sample $x_i \in
\mathbb{R}^n$, we can obtain vectors $x'_i\in \mathbb{R}^n$ satisfying
$x_i=c_ix'_i$ for some $c_i \neq 0$. To prove theorem, we introduce the notion
of virtual polynomials, which are polynomials written as the output of a node

structure for the loss surfaces, called semi-algebraic sets. We analyze these
loss surfaces from the algebro-geometric point of view. Factorization of

factorization of the virtual polynomials in terms of their active paths. This
framework can be applied to the leakage problem in the training of deep neural
networks. The main theorem in this paper indicates that there are many risks
associated with the training of deep neural networks. For example, if we have N

are sufficiently close to each other, we can obtain the input of training

two small parameters that control the $U(2)$ breaking. In contrast to previous
$U(2)$ models this setup can be realized without supersymmetry and provides an
excellent fit to all SM flavor observables including neutrinos. We also
consider a variant of this model based on a $D_6 \times U(1)_F$ flavor
symmetry, which closely resembles the $U(2)$ structure, but allows for Majorana
neutrino masses from the Weinberg operator. Remarkably, in this case one
naturally obtains large mixing in the lepton sector from small mixing in the
quark sector. The model also offers a natural option for addressing the Strong
CP Problem and Dark Matter by identifying the Goldstone boson of the $U(1)_F$
factor as the QCD axion.

phenomenological limits on this coupling (e.g. due to lepton number violation
and the preservation of the baryon asymmetry) are relaxed when the
supersymmetric mass spectrum is assumed to be heavy (in excess of the
inflationary scale of $3 \times 10^{13}$ GeV), the requirement that the
gravitino be sufficiently long-lived so as to account for the observed dark
matter density, leads to a relatively strong bound on $\mu^\prime \lesssim 20$
GeV. The dominant decay channels for the longitudinal component of the
gravitino are $Z \nu, W^\pm l^\mp$, and $h\nu$. To avoid an excess neutrino
signal in IceCube, our limit on $\mu'$ is then strengthened to $\mu' \lesssim

detectable flux of mono-chromatic neutrinos with EeV energies.

clear hourglass magnetic field morphology centered on the protostellar system,
but the central pattern is consistent with a toroidal field indicative of a
circumstellar disk, although other interpretations are also possible, including
field lines dragged by an equatorial accretion flow into a configuration
parallel to the midplane. If a relatively large disk does exist, it would
suggest that the magnetic braking catastrophe is averted in this system, not
through a large misalignment between the magnetic and rotation axes, but rather
through some other mechanisms, such as non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic effects
and/or turbulence. We have also found a relationship of decreasing polarization
fractions with intensities and the various slopes of this relationship can be
understood as multiple polarization mechanisms and/or depolarization from a
changing field morphology. In addition, we found a prominent clumpy
depolarization strip crossing the center perpendicular to the bipolar outflow.
Moreover, a rough estimate of the magnetic field strength indicates that the
field is strong enough to hinder formation of a rotationally supported disk,
which is inconsistent with the feature of a central toroidal field.

are able to determine (or place limits on) the systems bulk motions and average
internal properties. The systems are found to be very metal-poor, in agreement
with dwarf galaxies and dwarf galaxy candidates of similar luminosity. The only
system that we can place firmly in the category of dwarf galaxies is Phx II,
given its resolved large velocity dispersion ($9.5_{-4.4}^{+6.8}$ km/s) and
intrinsic metallicity spread (0.33 dex). Also for Col I we measure a clear
metallicity spread. The orbital pole of Phx II is well constrained and close to
that of the LMC, suggesting a prior association. The uncertainty on the orbital
poles of the other systems are presently very large, so that an association
cannot be excluded, apart from Col I. Using the numbers of potential former

better constrained when using Gaia astrometry compared to HST astrometry, in
particular the relative positions of the background quasar source and the

the expert human intuition needed to use these heuristics correctly. The
approach outlined in this thesis represents a paradigm shift away from that
traditional approach. I argue that perfect reconstructions are not only
unnecessary for the purposes of delay-coordinate based forecasting, but that
they can often be less effective than reduced-order versions of those same
models. I demonstrate this using a range of low- and high-dimensional dynamical
systems, showing that forecast models that employ imperfect reconstructions of
the dynamics---i.e., models that are not necessarily true embeddings---can
produce surprisingly accurate predictions of the future state of these systems.
I develop a theoretical framework for understanding why this is so. This
framework, which combines information theory and computational topology, also
allows one to quantify the amount of predictive structure in a given time
series, and even to choose which forecast method will be the most effective for
those data.

properties. Combined with the mean period of ab-type variables (<Pab> =
0.631+-0.004 d) and the c-type fraction (~0.14) in Crater II, this suggests an
Oo-int classification for Crater II and implies that its nature is more like a

distance of Crater II, from the photometric and pulsation properties of the RR
Lyrae stars. The stellar population model we have constructed indicates that
Crater II is dominated by an old population, but is relatively younger than the
oldest globular clusters in the MW. With a lack of high-amplitude short-period

N(HI)> = 16.6 at projected distances d<~160 kpc. We measure a mean covering
fraction of optically-thick gas with log N(HI)>~17.2 of
<kappa>LLS=0.44^{+0.12}_{-0.11} at d<~160 kpc and
<kappa>LLS=0.71^{+0.11}_{-0.20} at d<~100 kpc. The line-of-sight velocity
separations between the HI absorbing gas and LRGs are characterized by a mean
and dispersion of <v_{gas-gal}>=29 km/s and \sigma_v_{gas-gal}=171 km/s.
Combining COS FUV and ground-based echelle spectra provides an expanded
spectral coverage for multiple ionic transitions, from low-ionization MgII and
SiII, to intermediate ionization SiIII and CIII, and to high-ionization OVI
absorption lines. We find that intermediate ions probed by CIII and SiIII are
the most prominent UV metal lines in LRG halos with a mean covering fraction of
<kappa(CIII)>_{0.1}=0.75^{+0.08}_{-0.13} for W(977)>=0.1 Ang at d<160 kpc,
comparable to what is seen for CIII in L* and sub-L* star-forming and red
galaxies but exceeding MgII or OVI in quiescent halos. The COS-LRG survey shows
that massive quiescent halos contain widespread chemically-enriched cool gas
and that little distinction between LRG and star-forming halos is found in
their HI and CIII content.

information with one another. Though simple reshare cascades have been studied
extensively, the full range of cascading behaviors on social media is much more
diverse. Here we study how diffusion protocols, or the social exchanges that
enable information transmission, affect cascade growth, analogous to the way
communication protocols define how information is transmitted from one point to
another. Studying 98 of the largest information cascades on Facebook, we find a
wide range of diffusion protocols - from cascading reshares of images, which
use a simple protocol of tapping a single button for propagation, to the ALS
Ice Bucket Challenge, whose diffusion protocol involved individuals creating
and posting a video, and then nominating specific others to do the same. We
find recurring classes of diffusion protocols, and identify two key
counterbalancing factors in the construction of these protocols, with
implications for a cascade's growth: the effort required to participate in the
cascade, and the social cost of staying on the sidelines. Protocols requiring
greater individual effort slow down a cascade's propagation, while those
imposing a greater social cost of not participating increase the cascade's
adoption likelihood. The predictability of transmission also varies with
protocol. But regardless of mechanism, the cascades in our analysis all have a
similar reproduction number ($\approx$ 1.8), meaning that lower rates of
exposure can be offset with higher per-exposure rates of adoption. Last, we
show how a cascade's structure can not only differentiate these protocols, but
also be modeled through branching processes. Together, these findings provide a
framework for understanding how a wide variety of information cascades can
achieve substantial adoption across a network.

I superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) classified as part of our search for low-$z$
SLSNe. PS16aqv is a fast evolving SLSNe-I that reached a peak absolute
magnitude of $M_{r} \approx -22.1$. The lightcurves exhibit a significant
undulation at 30 rest-frame days after peak, with a behavior similar to
undulations seen in the slowly fading SLSN-I SN 2015bn. This similarity
strengthens the case that fast and slow SLSNe-I form a continuum with a common
origin. At $\approx\!80$ days after peak, the lightcurves exhibit a transition
to a slow decline, followed by significant subsequent steepening, indicative of
a plateau phase or a second significant undulation. Deep limits at $\approx280$
days after peak imply a tight constraint on the nickel mass, $M_{\rm Ni}
\lesssim 0.35$ M$_{\odot}$ (lower than for previous SLSNe-I), and indicate that
some SLSNe-I do not produce significantly more nickel than normal Type Ic SNe.
Using MOSFiT, we model the lightcurve with a magnetar central engine model and
find $P_{\rm spin} \approx 0.9$ ms, $B \approx 1.5 \times 10^{14}$ G, and
$M_{\rm ej} \approx 16$ M$_{\odot}$. The implied rapid spin-down time and large
reservoir of available energy coupled with the high ejecta mass may account for
the fast evolving lightcurve and slow spectroscopic evolution. We also study
the location of PS16aqv in its host galaxy and find that it occurred at an
offset of $2.46 \pm 0.21$ kpc from the central star-forming region. We find the
host galaxy exhibits low metallicity and spatially varying extinction and star
formation rate, with the explosion site exhibiting lower values than the
central region. The complexity seen in the lightcurves of PS16aqv and other
events highlights the importance of obtaining well-sampled lightcurves for
exploring deviations from a uniform decline.

in nonparametric data analysis. The halfspace depth of a query point $q\in
\mathbb{R}^d$ with respect to $S\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ is the minimum portion of
the elements of $S$ which are contained in a halfspace which passes through
$q$. For $\beta \geq 1$, the $\beta$-skeleton depth of $q$ with respect to $S$
is defined to be the total number of \emph{$\beta$-skeleton influence regions}
that contain $q$, where each of these influence regions is the intersection of
two hyperballs obtained from a pair of points in $S$. The $\beta$-skeleton
depth introduces a family of depth functions that contain \emph{spherical
depth} and \emph{lens depth} if $\beta=1$ and $\beta=2$, respectively. The main
results of this paper include approximating the planar halfspace depth and
$\beta$-skeleton depth using two different approximation methods. First, the
halfspace depth is approximated by the $\beta$-skeleton depth values. For this
method, two dissimilarity measures based on the concepts of \emph{fitting
function} and \emph{Hamming distance} are defined to train the halfspace depth
function by the $\beta$-skeleton depth values obtaining from a given data set.
The goodness of this approximation is measured by a function of error values.
Secondly, computing the planar $\beta$-skeleton depth is reduced to a
combination of some range counting problems. Using existing results on range
counting approximations, the planar $\beta$-skeleton depth of a query point is
approximated in $O(n\;poly(1/\varepsilon,\log n))$, $\beta\geq 1$. Regarding
the $\beta$-skeleton depth functions, it is also proved that this family of
depth functions converge when $\beta \to \infty$. Finally, some experimental
results are provided to support the proposed method of approximation and
convergence of $\beta$-skeleton depth functions.

models undergoing a superconductor-insulator (SI) quantum phase transition

the superconducting state is necessarily accompanied by a sound-like mode due
to collective oscillations of the phase of the complex-valued order parameter.
Exciting this phase mode results in transverse photons propagating along the
chain. Surprisingly little is known about the fate of this mode upon entering
the insulating state, where the order parameter's amplitude remains non-zero,
but the phase ordering is ""melted"" by quantum fluctuations. Here we report
momentum-resolved radio-frequency spectroscopy of collective modes in
nanofabricated chains of Al/AlOx/Al tunnel junctions. We find that the phase
mode survives remarkably far into the insulating regime, such that
$\textrm{M}\Omega$-resistance chains carry $\textrm{GHz}$-frequency alternating
currents as nearly ideal superconductors. The insulator reveals itself through
broadening and random frequency shifts of collective mode resonances,
originated from intrinsic interactions. By pushing the chain parameters deeper
into the insulating state, we achieved propagation with the speed of light down
to $8\times 10^5~\textrm{m/s}$ and the wave impedance up to
$23~\textrm{k}\Omega$. The latter quantity exceeds the predicted critical
impedance by an order of magnitude, which opens the problem of quantum
electrodynamics of a Bose glass insulator for both theory and experiment.
Notably, the effective fine structure constant of such a 1D vacuum exceeds a
unity, promising transformative applications to quantum science and technology.

supernovae. Based on the existence of long-lived white dwarfs and the observed
supernovae rate, we derive new constraints on ultra-heavy DM which produce SM
particles through DM-DM annihilations, DM decays, and DM-SM scattering
interactions in the stellar medium. As a concrete example, we rule out
supersymmetric Q-ball DM in parameter space complementary to terrestrial
bounds. We put further constraints on DM that is captured by white dwarfs,

time-varying tension. The string lies on the Winkler foundation with a point
inhomogeneity (a concentrated spring of negative stiffness). In such a system
with constant parameters (the string tension), under certain conditions a
trapped mode of oscillation exists and is unique. Therefore, applying a
non-stationary external excitation to this system can lead to the emergence of
the string oscillations localized near the inhomogeneity. We provide an
analytical description of non-stationary localized oscillations of the string
with slowly time-varying tension using the asymptotic procedure based on
successive application of two asymptotic methods, namely the method of
stationary phase and the method of multiple scales. The obtained analytical
results were verified by independent numerical calculations based on the finite
difference method. The applicability of the analytical formulas was
demonstrated for various types of external excitation and laws governing the
varying tension. In particular, we have shown that in the case when the trapped
mode frequency approaches zero, localized low-frequency oscillations with
increasing amplitude precede the localized string buckling. The dependence of
the amplitude of such oscillations on its frequency is more complicated in
comparison with the case of a one degree of freedom system with time-varying
stiffness.

coefficients in conformal field theories with large central charge and a sparse
spectrum of higher spin operators. The formalism has the interpretation of a
new conformal collider-type experiment for these class of CFTs and hence it has
the advantage of requiring knowledge only about CFT three-point functions. This
is accomplished by considering the holographic null energy operator which was
introduced in arXiv:1709.03597 as a generalization of the averaged null energy
operator. Analyticity properties of correlators in the Regge limit imply that
the holographic null energy operator is a positive operator in a subspace of
the total CFT Hilbert space. Utilizing this positivity condition, we derive
bounds on three-point functions $\langle TO_1O_2\rangle$ of the stress tensor
with various operators for CFTs with large central charge and a sparse
spectrum. After imposing these constraints, we also find that the operator
product expansions of all primary operators in the Regge limit have certain
universal properties. All of these results are consistent with the expectation
that CFTs in this class, irrespective of their microscopic details, admit
universal gravity-like holographic dual descriptions. Furthermore, this
connection enables us to constrain various inflationary observables such as the
amplitude of chiral gravity waves, non-gaussanity of gravity waves and
tensor-to-scalar ratio.

health. In this study we used an objective health indicator, namely
antidepressant prescription rates. Current studies rely exclusively upon mean
regression models assuming linear associations. It is, however, plausible that
the presence of green space is non-linearly related with different quantiles of
the outcome antidepressant prescription rates. These restrictions may
contribute to inconsistent findings. Our aim was to assess antidepressant
prescription rates in relation to green space, and to analyze how the
relationship varies non-linearly across different quantiles of antidepressant
prescription rates. We used cross-sectional data for the year 2014 at a
municipality level in the Netherlands. Ecological Bayesian geoadditive quantile
regressions were fitted for the 15, 50, and 85 percent quantiles to estimate
green space-prescription rate correlations, controlling for confounders. The
results suggested that green space was overall inversely and non-linearly
associated with antidepressant prescription rates. More important, the
associations differed across the quantiles, although the variation was modest.
Significant non-linearities were apparent: The associations were slightly
positive in the lower quantile and strongly negative in the upper one. Our
findings imply that an increased availability of green space within a
municipality may contribute to a reduction in the number of antidepressant
prescriptions dispensed. Green space is thus a central health and community
asset, whilst a minimum level of 28 percent needs to be established for health
gains. The highest effectiveness occurred at a municipality surface percentage
higher than 79 percent. This inverse dose-dependent relation has important
implications for setting future community-level health and planning policies.

of either using slow internode communication or a potentially less accurate but
smaller basis set such as Gaussians. Here, we introduce a hybrid representation
of the single particle orbitals that combine a localized atomic basis set
around atomic cores and B-splines in the interstitial regions to reduce the
memory usage while retaining high speed of evaluation and either retaining or
increasing overall accuracy. We present a benchmark calculation for NiO

recently proposed method for estimating the average satellite population around
a given sample of nearby bright galaxies, using a combination of size and
magnitude cuts (to select low-redshift dwarf galaxies preferentially) and
clustering measurements (to estimate the fraction of true satellites in the cut
sample). We test this method using the high-precision photometric redshift
catalog of the COSMOS survey, exploring the effect of specific cuts on the
clustering signal. The most effective of the size-magnitude cuts considered
recover the clustering signal around low-redshift primaries (z < 0.15) with
about two-thirds of the signal and 80\%\ of the signal-to-noise ratio
obtainable using the full COSMOS photometric redshifts. These cuts are also
fairly efficient, with more than one third of the selected objects being
clustered satellites. We conclude that structural selection represents a useful
tool in characterizing dwarf populations to fainter magnitudes and/or over
larger areas than are feasible with spectroscopic surveys.} In reviewing the
low-redshift content of the COSMOS field, we also note the existence of several
dozen objects that appear resolved or partially resolved in the HST imaging,

granular layer, at the critical point of the liquid-to-solid transition,
displays dynamic hyperuniformity. Prior to the transition, patches of the solid
phase form, with length scales and mean lifetimes that diverge critically at
the transition point. When reducing the wavenumber, density fluctuations
encounter increasingly more patches that block their propagation, resulting in
a static structure factor that tends to zero for small wavenumbers at the
critical point, which is a signature of hyperuniformity. A simple model
demonstrates that this coupling of a density field to a highly fluctuating
scalar friction field gives rise to dynamic hyperuniform states. Finally, we
show that the structure factor detects better the emergence of hyperuniformity,

number of data-driven strategies for discovering nonlinear multiscale dynamical
systems and their embeddings from data. We consider two canonical cases: (i)
systems for which we have full measurements of the governing variables, and
(ii) systems for which we have incomplete measurements. For systems with full
state measurements, we show that the recent sparse identification of nonlinear
dynamical systems (SINDy) method can discover governing equations with
relatively little data and introduce a sampling method that allows SINDy to
scale efficiently to problems with multiple time scales. Specifically, we can
discover distinct governing equations at slow and fast scales. For systems with
incomplete observations, we show that the Hankel alternative view of Koopman
(HAVOK) method, based on time-delay embedding coordinates, can be used to
obtain a linear model and Koopman invariant measurement system that nearly
perfectly captures the dynamics of nonlinear quasiperiodic systems. We

outcomes. Interrupted time series (ITS) is a quasi-experimental design
developed for inferring the effectiveness of a health policy intervention while
accounting for temporal dependence within a single system or unit. Current
standardized ITS methods do not simultaneously analyze data for several units,
nor are there methods to test for the existence of a change point and to assess
statistical power for study planning purposes in this context. To address this
limitation we propose the `Robust Multiple ITS' (R-MITS) model, appropriate for
multi-unit ITS data, that allows for inference regarding the estimation of a
global change point across units in the presence of a potentially lagged (or
anticipatory) treatment effect. Under the R-MITS model, one can formally test
for the existence of a change point and estimate the time delay between the
formal intervention implementation and the over-all-unit intervention effect.
We conducted empirical simulation studies to assess the type one error rate of
the testing procedure, power for detecting specified change-point alternatives,
and accuracy of the proposed estimating methodology. R-MITS is illustrated by
analyzing patient satisfaction data from a hospital that implemented and
evaluated a new care delivery model in multiple units.

opposite of that expected without including the effects of

  error","24 pages, added Sections 10 and 11",,,,"eess.SP cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In most error correction coding (ECC) frameworks, the typical error metric is
the bit error rate (BER) which measures the number of bit errors. For this
metric, the positions of the bits are not relevant to the decoding, and in many
noise models, not relevant to the BER either. In many applications this is
unsatisfactory as typically all bits are not equal and have different
significance. We consider the problem of bit error correction and mitigation
where bits in different positions have different importance. For error
correction, we look at ECC from a Bayesian perspective and introduce Bayes
estimators with general loss functions to take into account the bit
significance. We propose ECC schemes that optimize this error metric. As the
problem is highly nonlinear, traditional ECC construction techniques are not
applicable. Using exhaustive search is cost prohibitive, and thus we use
iterative improvement search techniques to find good codebooks. We optimize
both general codebooks and linear codes. We provide numerical experiments to
show that they can be superior to classical linear block codes such as Hamming
codes and decoding methods such as minimum distance decoding.
  For error mitigation, we study the case where ECC is not possible or not
desirable, but significance aware encoding of information is still beneficial
in reducing the average error. We propose a novel number presentation format
suitable for emerging storage media where the noise magnitude is unknown and
possibly large and show that it has lower mean error than the traditional
number format.

sources threatens the stability of the power grid. To solve this issue, several
methods have been proposed to control the demand side instead of increasing the
spinning reserve on the supply side. Here we focus on dynamic demand control
(DDC), a method in which appliances can delay its scheduled operation if the
electric frequency is outside a suitable range. We have recently shown that DDC
effectively reduces small and medium-size frequency fluctuations but, due to
the need of recovering pending tasks, the probability of large demand peaks,
and hence large frequency fluctuations, may actually increase. Although these
events are very rare they can potentially trigger a failure of the system and
therefore strategies to avoid them have to be addressed. In this work, we
introduce a new method including communication among DDC devices belonging to a
given group, such that they can coordinate opposite actions to keep the group
demand more stable. We show that for this method the amount of pending tasks
decreases by a factor 10 while large frequency fluctuations are significantly
reduced or even completely avoided.

pivotal aspect to comprehend the EoR is to probe the intertwined relationship
between the fraction of ionizing photons capable to escape dark haloes, also

rate of ionizing photons appear to have a larger impact on $f_{esc}$ than
previously thought. A naive univariate analysis of the same problem would
suggest smaller effects for these properties and a much larger impact for the
specific star formation rate, which is lessened after accounting for other
galaxy properties and non-linearities in the statistical model.

combine our Adversarial Direction (AD) method with the recently proposed
Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) method for sequential learning. We train
each task for 20 epochs, which yields good initial performance (99.24% correct
task 1 performance). After training task 2, and then task 3, both plain
gradient descent (PGD) and EWC largely forget task 1 (task 1 accuracy 32.95%
for PGD and 41.02% for EWC), while our combined approach (AD+EWC) still
achieves 94.53% correct on task 1. We obtain similar results with a much more

before (70.10% initial task 1 performance, 67.73% after learning tasks 2 and 3

that AD+EWC can provide better sequential learning performance than either PGD

constructing a simplified eigenstructure (so-called pseudo-eigenstructure), and
the applicability is demonstrated by calculating the thermal expansion of
metallic silver in three cases: (a) at stable equilibrium, (b) along three
irreversible paths from an initial nonequilibrium state to stable equilibrium,
and (c) along an irreversible path between two stable equilibrium states. The
SEAQT framework with an anharmonic pseudo-eigenstructure predicts reasonable
values for equilibrium thermal expansion. For the irreversible cases
considered, the SEAQT approach makes it possible to predict the time-dependence
of lattice relaxations from the initial state to the final state.

  We, on the other hand, approach this problem from an opposing angle and
propose a new framework, Adversarial Structure Matching (ASM), for training
such structured prediction networks via an adversarial process, in which we
train a structure analyzer that provides the supervisory signals, the ASM loss.
The structure analyzer is trained to maximize the ASM loss, or to emphasize
recurring multi-scale hard negative structural mistakes among co-occurring
patterns. On the contrary, the structured prediction network is trained to
reduce those mistakes and is thus enabled to distinguish fine-grained
structures. As a result, training structured prediction networks using ASM
reduces contextual confusion among objects and improves boundary localization.
We demonstrate that our ASM outperforms pixel-wise IID loss or structural prior
GAN loss on three different structured prediction tasks: semantic segmentation,
monocular depth estimation, and surface normal prediction.

dependence on the availability of labeled data and the rapid expansion of image
categories raise the significant challenge of zero-shot learning. Zero-shot
learning (ZSL) aims to transfer knowledge from labeled classes into unlabeled
classes to reduce human labeling effort. In this paper, we propose a novel
progressive ensemble network model with multiple projected label embeddings to
address zero-shot image recognition. The ensemble network is built by learning
multiple image classification functions with a shared feature extraction
network but different label embedding representations, which enhance the
diversity of the classifiers and facilitate information transfer to unlabeled
classes. A progressive training framework is then deployed to gradually label
the most confident images in each unlabeled class with predicted pseudo-labels
and update the ensemble network with the training data augmented by the
pseudo-labels. The proposed model performs training on both labeled and
unlabeled data. It can naturally bridge the domain shift problem in visual
appearances and be extended to the generalized zero-shot learning scenario. We
conduct experiments on multiple ZSL datasets and the empirical results
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model.

goal is to train these networks in an incremental manner, without the
computationally expensive experience replay. By studying how individual neural
nodes behave in online training, we recognize that the global nature of ReLU
gates can cause undesirable learning interference in each node's learning
behavior. We propose reducing such interferences with two efficient input
transformation methods that are geometric in nature and match well the
geometric property of ReLU gates. The first one is tile coding, a classic
binary encoding scheme originally designed for local generalization based on
the topological structure of the input space. The second one (EmECS) is a new
method we introduce; it is based on geometric properties of convex sets and
topological embedding of the input space into the boundary of a convex set. We
discuss the behavior of the network when it operates on the transformed inputs.
We also compare it experimentally with some neural nets that do not use the
same input transformations, and with the classic algorithm of tile coding plus
a linear function approximator, and on several online reinforcement learning
tasks, we show that the neural net with tile coding or EmECS can achieve not
only faster learning but also more accurate approximations. Our results
strongly suggest that geometric input transformation of this type can be
effective for interference reduction and takes us a step closer to fully
incremental reinforcement learning with neural nets.

regularize the singular values of the convolution operator and making the

demonstrate that the learning dynamics and the classification performance of

RNBRW gives a weight to each edge equal to the probability that a

with larger weights may be thought of as more important to the formation of
cycles. Of note, since separate random walks can be performed in parallel,
RNBRW weights can be estimated very quickly, even for large graphs. We give
simulation results showing that pre-weighting edges through RNBRW may
substantially improve the performance of common community detection algorithms.

One primary PUF application is the secure derivation of volatile cryptographic

and ii) entropy extraction. Although the entropy extractor can be lightweight,
the overhead of the secure sketch responsible correcting naturally noisy PUF
responses is usually costly. We observe that, in general, response
unreliability with respect to a enrolled reference measurement increases with
increasing differences between the in-the-field PUF operating condition and the
operating condition used in evaluating the enrolled reference response. For the
first time, we exploit such an important but inadvertent observation. In
contrast to the conventional single reference response enrollment, we propose
enrolling multiple reference responses (MRR) subject to the same challenge but
under multiple distinct operating conditions. The critical observation here is
that one of the reference operating conditions is likely to be closer to the
operating condition of the field deployed PUF, thus, resulting in minimizing
the expected unreliability when compared to the single reference under the
nominal condition. Overall, MRR greatly reduces the demand for the expected
number of erroneous bits for correction and, subsequently, achieve a
significant reduction in the error correction overhead. The significant
implementation efficiency gains from the proposed MRR method is demonstrated
from software implementations of fuzzy extractors on batteryless resource

problems. The number-level problems format sequences as 2-dimensional grids of
digits and the digit-level problems provide a single digit input per a time
step. The complexity of a number-level sequence prediction can be defined with
the depth of an equivalent combinatorial logic, and the complexity of a
digit-level sequence prediction can be defined with an equivalent state
automaton for the generation rule. Experiments with number-level sequences
suggest that CNN models are capable of learning the compound operations of
sequence generation rules, but the depths of the compound operations are
limited. For the digit-level problems, simple GRU and LSTM models can solve
some problems with the complexity of finite state automata. Memory augmented
models such as Stack-RNN, Attention, and Neural Turing Machines can solve the
reverse-order task which has the complexity of simple pushdown automaton.
However, all of above cannot solve general Fibonacci, Arithmetic or Geometric
sequence generation problems that represent the complexity of queue automata or
Turing machines. The results show that our number sequence prediction problems
effectively evaluate machine learning models' computational capabilities.

the effective description of wave motion reveals several distinct asymptotic

a repeated eigenvalue. One of these regimes -- for whose occurence we expose a
sufficient condition -- is shown to describe the so-called Dirac points, i.e.
conical contacts between dispersion surfaces, that are relevant to the
phenomenon of topological insulation. For all cases considered, the effective

Gap-opening mechanisms such as secular gravitational instability and dust

an unseen planet created the observed gap structure cannot be ruled out,
although the coexistence of an eccentric hot Jupiter and a distant planet

capture into first-order mean motion resonances (MMRs) using a parametrized
planet migration model that takes into account nonlinear eccentricity damping
due to planet-disk interaction. This parametrization is based on numerical
hydrodynamical simulations and is more realistic than the simple linear
parametrization widely used in previous analytic studies. We find that
nonlinear eccentricity damping can significantly influence the stability and
outcome of resonance capture. In particular, the equilibrium eccentricity of
the planet captured into MMRs become larger, and the captured MMR state tends
to be more stable compared to the prediction based on the simple migration
model. In addition, when the migration is sufficiently fast or/and the planet
mass ratio is sufficiently small, we observe a novel phenomenon of eccentricity
overshoot, where the planet's eccentricity becomes very large before settling
down to the lower equilibrium value. This can lead to the ejection of the
smaller planet if its eccentricity approaches unity during the overshoot. This
may help explain the lack of low-mass planet companion of hot Jupiters when

Because of the possible high support of the inside noise events, such
free-rider episodes may have abnormally high support that they cannot be
filtered by frequency based framework. An effective technique for filtering
free-rider episodes is using a partition model to divide an episode into two
consecutive subepisodes and comparing the observed support of such episode with
its expected support under the assumption that these two subepisodes occur
independently. In this paper, we take more complex subepisodes into
consideration and develop a novel partition model named EDP for free-rider
episode filtering from a given set of episodes. It combines (1) a dual
partition strategy which divides an episode to an underlying real pattern and
potential noises; (2) a novel definition of the expected support of a
free-rider episode based on the proposed partition strategy. We can deem the
episode interesting if the observed support is substantially higher than the
expected support estimated by our model. The experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate EDP can effectively filter free-rider episodes

the underlying machine learning problem. Specifically, stochastic fluctuations
drive a system to explore a range of configurations providing `raw' information
for a learning algorithm to construct an accurate model; yet they also blur
energetic differences between network states and thereby degrade information.
This competition leads spin networks to generically have an intrinsic optimal
temperature at which stochastic spin fluctuations provide maximal information
for discriminating among competing models, maximizing inference efficiency. We
demonstrate a simple active learning protocol that optimizes network
temperature to boost inference efficiency and dramatically increases the
efficiency of inference on a neural circuit reconstruction task. Our results

difficulties to existing state-of-the-art metric-based algorithms since a
single metric is insufficient to capture complex task variations in natural
language domain. To alleviate the problem, we propose an adaptive metric
learning approach that automatically determines the best weighted combination
from a set of metrics obtained from meta-training tasks for a newly seen
few-shot task. Extensive quantitative evaluations on real-world sentiment
analysis and dialog intent classification datasets demonstrate that the

enhanced by reducing static inductance (L0) and anode length (z0) along with
increasing anode radius (a) and cathode radius (b), keeping their ratio (c =

at operating pressure 3.3 Torr with corresponding X-ray yield efficiency 2.16%,
while the end axial speed becomes 6.42 cm/s. This value of neon Ysxr yield is
twelve to thirteen times higher than the measured value (5.4 J) at 3.0 Torr. It
is also found that this neon Ysxr yield is improved around seven times from

contrastive estimation (NCE), which estimates non-normalized models by
discriminating between the observed data and some artificially generated noise.
We also propose an extension of NCE with multiple noise distributions. Then,
based on the observation that conventional classification learning with neural
networks is implicitly assuming an exponential family as a generative model, we
introduce a method for clustering unlabeled data by estimating a finite mixture
of distributions in an exponential family. Estimation of this mixture model is
attained by the proposed extensions of NCE where the training data of neural

probabilistically principled clustering method that is able to utilize a deep

A non-standard stochastic differential equation, with neither Lipschitz

process. A mixture of probabilistic arguments are used to construct the state
process, and establish its non-explosiveness and strict positivity. This leads
to the optimality of a feedback consumption process, defined in terms of the
value function and the state process. Based on additional viscosity solutions
techniques, we characterize the value function as the unique classical solution
to a nonlinear elliptic equation, among an appropriate class of functions. This
characterization involves a condition on the limiting behavior of the value

section predictions calculated using different parameter sets. [Purpose] A
measurement of the radiative alpha-capture and the alpha-induced reaction cross
sections on the nucleus 115In at low energies allows a stringent test of
statistical model predictions. Since experimental data is scarce in this mass
region, this measurement can be an important input to test the global
applicability of alpha+nucleus optical model potentials and further ingredients

by means of the activation method. The produced activities were determined by
off-line detection of the gamma-rays and characteristic x-rays emitted during
the electron capture decay of the produced Sb isotopes. The

various lower- and higher-order nonclassical states in both codirectional and
contradirectional asymmetric nonlinear optical couplers operating under second
harmonic generation with the help of moments-based criteria. Using another such
system (a symmetric nonlinear optical coupler), we have also established the
possibility of observing quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects and further reduced
the obtained results to yield the corresponding expressions for the asymmetric
coupler. These studies have been accomplished using a complete quantum
description of the system considering all the field modes as weak. Further,
characterization of nonclassicality in spin systems using quasiprobability
distributions has been performed, which has also provided us the dynamics of
the amount of nonclassicality (using nonclassical volume). As the
reconstruction of quasiprobability distributions is possible with the help of
tomograms accessible in the experiments, tomograms are computed here for both

that takes advantages of the immiscibility between Cu and Li is the widespread
utilization of Cu foils as the anodic current collector in Li-ion batteries.
Here we show that the nanoscale size effect can play a subtle yet critical role
in mediating the chemical activity of Cu and therefore its miscibility with Li,
such that the electrochemical alloying and solid-state amorphization will occur
in such an immiscible system when decreasing Cu nanoparticle sizes into
ultrasmall range. This unusual observation was accomplished by performing
in-situ studies of the electrochemical lithiation processes of individual CuO
nanowires inside a transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Upon lithiation, CuO
nanowires are first electrochemically reduced to form discrete ultrasmall Cu
nanocrystals that, unexpectedly, can in turn undergo further electrochemical
lithiation to form amorphous CuLix nanoalloys. Real-time dynamic observations
by in-situ TEM unveil that there is a critical grain size (ca. 6 nm), below
which the crystalline Cu nanoparticles can be continuously lithiated and
amorphized. Electron energy loss spectra indicate that there is a net charge
transfer from Li to Cu in the amorphous CuLix nanoalloys. Another intriguing
finding is that the amorphous alloying phenomena in Cu-Li system is reversible,
as manifested by the in-situ observation of electron-beam-induced delithiation
of the as-formed amorphous CuLix nanoalloys.

resolution for a given diameter than commercial fiber bundle endoscopes.
However, a drawback of MMF endoscopes is that imaging quality degrades
substantially as the MMF is perturbed. We propose a method for improving spot
formation at the distal end of a perturbed MMF, and thus improving imaging
quality, by attaching a partial reflector to the distal end of the MMF. We
experimentally find that the perturbation of the light reflected from the
partial reflector is highly correlated with the perturbation of the light
transmitted through the MMF. We demonstrate a simple method exploiting this
correlation that enables formation of spots at the distal fiber end with
quality 10-15% higher than if the perturbation of the MMF is ignored. In the

interest to examine the persistence of the magic character across the N$=$50
shell gap in extremely neutron rich exotic nucleus $^{78}$Ni in ground as well
as excited states. A systematic study of Ni isotopes and N$=$50 isotones in
ground state is performed within the microscopic framework of relativistic
mean-field (RMF) and the triaxially deformed Nilson Strutinsky model (NSM).
Ground state density distributions, charge form factors, radii, separation
energies, pairing energies, single particle energies and the shell corrections
show strong magicity in $^{78}$Ni. Excited nuclei are treated within the
statistical theory of hot rotating nuclei where the variation of level density
parameter and entropy shows significant magicity with a deep minima at N$=$50,
which, persists up to the temperatures $\approx$ 1.5$-$2 MeV and then slowly
disappear with increasing temperature. Rotational states are evaluated and
effect of rotation on N$=$50 (Z$=$20$-$30) isotones are studied. Our results
agree very well with the available experimental data and few other theoretical

Structural characterization shows excellent crystallinity over extended lateral

4 K and a transition to a superconducting state below 1.2 K with a Tc ~ 920 mK.
The 2D nature of the superconducting state is confirmed from the
magneto-transport anisotropy against field orientations and the presence of BKT

two-dimensionality and possibility of scalably engineering semiconducting,

distinct colours. The study of rainbow subgraphs goes back more than two
hundred years to the work of Euler on Latin squares and has been the focus of
extensive research ever since. Euler posed a problem equivalent to finding
properly $n$-edge-coloured complete bipartite graphs $K_{n,n}$ which can be
decomposed into rainbow perfect matchings. While there are proper
edge-colourings of $K_{n,n}$ without even a single rainbow perfect matching,
the theme of this paper is to show that with some very weak additional
constraints one can find many disjoint rainbow perfect matchings. In
particular, we prove that if some fraction of the colour classes have at most
$(1-o(1)) n$ edges then one can nearly-decompose the edges of $K_{n,n}$ into
edge-disjoint perfect rainbow matchings. As an application of this, we
establish in a very strong form a conjecture of Akbari and Alipour and
asymptotically prove a conjecture of Barat and Nagy. Both these conjectures
concern rainbow perfect matchings in edge-colourings of $K_{n,n}$ with
quadratically many colours.
  Using our techniques, we also prove a number of results on
near-decompositions of graphs into other rainbow structures like Hamiltonian
cycles and spanning trees. Most notably, we prove that any properly coloured
complete graph can be nearly-decomposed into spanning rainbow trees. This
asymptotically proves the Brualdi-Hollingsworth and Kaneko-Kano-Suzuki
conjectures which predict that a perfect decomposition should exist under the
same assumptions.

standard F-measure we propose the relaxed F-measure which is differentiable
w.r.t the posterior and can be easily appended to the back of CNNs as the loss

gradients decrease dramatically in the saturated area, our loss function, named
FLoss, holds considerable gradients even when the activation approaches the
target. Consequently, the FLoss can continuously force the network to produce
polarized activations. Comprehensive benchmarks on several popular datasets
show that FLoss outperforms the state-of-the-art with a considerable margin.
More specifically, due to the polarized predictions, our method is able to
obtain high-quality saliency maps without carefully tuning the optimal

supervised-learning classifier models. In this paper we implement two recurrent
neural network models based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated
recurrent unit (GRU) cells and compare them to two traditional bag-of-words
classifiers: multinomial naive Bayes (MNB) and a support vector machine (SVM).
The MNB classifier is one of only two machine learning algorithms currently
being used for syndromic surveillance. All four models are trained to predict
diagnostic code groups as defined by Clinical Classification Software, first to
predict from discharge diagnosis, then from chief complaint fields. The
classifiers are trained on 3.6 million de-identified emergency department
records from a single United States jurisdiction. We compare performance of
these models primarily using the F1 score. Using discharge diagnoses, the LSTM
classifier performs best, though all models exhibit an F1 score above 96.00.
The GRU performs best on chief complaints (F1=47.38), and MNB with bigrams
performs worst (F1=39.40). Certain syndrome types are easier to detect than
others. For examples, chief complaints using the GRU model predicts
alcohol-related disorders well (F1=78.91) but predicts influenza poorly
(F1=14.80). In all instances, the RNN models outperformed the bag-of-word
classifiers, suggesting deep learning models could substantially improve the
automatic classification of unstructured text for syndromic surveillance.

$AB^T=J+kI$ for some integer $k\in\{-1,1,2,3,\ldots\}$. In this case $A$ and

showed that the rows with the fewest ones in any non-degenerate minimally

matrices with $k=-1$ are essentially equivalent to \emph{partitionable graphs}
(also known as $(\alpha,\omega)$-graphs), so have been heavily studied as part
of attempts to directly classify minimal imperfect graphs. In this paper, we
view a Lehman matrix as the bipartite adjacency matrix of a regular bipartite
graph, focusing in particular on the case where the graph is cubic. From this
perspective, we identify two constructions that generate cubic Lehman graphs
from smaller Lehman graphs. The most prolific of these constructions involves
repeatedly replacing suitable pairs of edges with a particular $6$-vertex
subgraph that we call a $3$-rung ladder segment. Two decades ago, L\""{u}tolf \&
Margot initiated a computational study of mni matrices and constructed a
catalogue containing (among other things) a listing of all cubic Lehman
matrices with $k =1$ of order up to $17 \times 17$. We verify their catalogue
(which has just one omission), and extend the computational results to $20
\times 20$ matrices. Of the $908$ cubic Lehman matrices (with $k=1$) of order
up to $20 \times 20$, only two do not arise from our $3$-rung ladder
construction. However these exceptions can be derived from our second
construction, and so our two constructions cover all known cubic Lehman

further confirm some and refute several other previously-identified encounters,
confirming suspicions about their data. The closest encounter in the sample is
Gl 710, which has a 95% probability of coming closer than 0.08 pc (17 000 AU).
Taking mass estimates from Gaia astrometry and multiband photometry for

illustration of the proof-theoretic semantic principles most relevant to the
treatment of logical connectives, we turn to illustrating the main features of
display calculi, a proof-theoretic paradigm which has been successfully

elimination metatheorem for display calculi, and a revised version of the

computing services. For example, a digit-recognition model should be applicable

address this new challenge from cloud computing, we develop a framework of
robust optimization over multiple domains. In lieu of minimizing the empirical
risk, we aim to learn a model optimized to the adversarial distribution over
multiple domains. Hence, we propose to learn the model and the adversarial
distribution simultaneously with the stochastic algorithm for efficiency.
Theoretically, we analyze the convergence rate for convex and non-convex
models. To our best knowledge, we first study the convergence rate of learning
a robust non-convex model with a practical algorithm. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the robustness of the framework and the convergence rate can
be further enhanced by appropriate regularizers over the adversarial

longstanding problem in machine learning. We propose in this work an extension
of that approach, which consists in embedding objects as elliptical probability
distributions, namely distributions whose densities have elliptical level sets.
We endow these measures with the 2-Wasserstein metric, with two important
benefits: (i) For such measures, the squared 2-Wasserstein metric has a closed
form, equal to a weighted sum of the squared Euclidean distance between means
and the squared Bures metric between covariance matrices. The latter is a
Riemannian metric between positive semi-definite matrices, which turns out to
be Euclidean on a suitable factor representation of such matrices, which is
valid on the entire geodesic between these matrices. (ii) The 2-Wasserstein
distance boils down to the usual Euclidean metric when comparing Diracs, and
therefore provides a natural framework to extend point embeddings. We show that
for these reasons Wasserstein elliptical embeddings are more intuitive and
yield tools that are better behaved numerically than the alternative choice of
Gaussian embeddings with the Kullback-Leibler divergence. In particular, and
unlike previous work based on the KL geometry, we learn elliptical
distributions that are not necessarily diagonal. We demonstrate the advantages

means of the field dislocation mechanics method and was applied to simulate the

influence of the precipitate aspect ratio and orientation was reasonably well
captured by the simple Orowan model in the absence of the stress-free

Consequently, the study of spatio-temporal search which explores both

This work study the problem of spatio-temporal \emph{k}-nearest neighbors

demonstrated by a set of indoor and outdoor experiments conducted using
off-the-shelf smartphones, while the energy-efficiency of LVS is demonstrated
by experiments using the Power Monitor energy tool. Finally, the security
properties of LVS are analyzed by simulation experiments. Results indicate that
the proposed LVS system is energy-efficient, applicable to most of the

increasingly linked to the role of binary central stars. Identifying a binary
within a PN offers a powerful tool with which to directly investigate the

18, is the archetype for several binary-linked morphological features, yet it
has no identified binary nucleus. It has the fastest jets seen in a PN of 630
km s$^{-1}$, a central star position offset from the nebula centre, and a
bipolar nebula with a very narrow waist. Here we report on the Southern African
Large Telescope (SALT) High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS) detection of radial
velocity variability in the nucleus of MyCn 18 with an orbital period of
$18.15\pm0.04$ days and a semi-amplitude of $11.0\pm0.3$ km s$^{-1}$. Adopting
an orbital inclination of $38\pm5$ deg and a primary mass of $0.6\pm0.1$
$M_\odot$ yields a secondary mass of $0.19\pm0.05$ $M_\odot$ corresponding to
an M5V companion. The detached nature of the binary rules out a classical nova
(CN) as the origin of the jets or the offset central star as hypothesised in
the literature. Furthermore, scenarios that produce the offset central star
during the AGB and that form narrow waist bipolar nebulae result in orbital
separations 80--800 times larger than observed in MyCn 18. The inner hourglass
and jets may have formed from part of the common envelope ejecta that remained
bound to the binary system in a circumbinary disk, whereas the offset central
star position may best be explained by proper motion. Detailed simulations of
MyCn 18 are encouraged that are compatible with the binary nucleus to further
investigate its complex formation history.

target object (e.g. a floor lamp) is designed to contain features of biological
source objects (e.g. flowers), resulting in creative biologically-inspired
design. In this work, we attempt to model the process of shape-oriented bionic
design as follows: given an input image of a design target object, the model
generates images that 1) maintain shape features of the input design target
image, 2) contain shape features of images from the specified biological source
domain, 3) are plausible and diverse. We propose DesignGAN, a novel
unsupervised deep generative approach to realising bionic design. Specifically,
we employ a conditional Generative Adversarial Networks architecture with
several designated losses (an adversarial loss, a regression loss, a cycle loss
and a latent loss) that respectively constrict our model to meet the
corresponding aforementioned requirements of bionic design modelling. We
perform qualitative and quantitative experiments to evaluate our method, and
demonstrate that our proposed approach successfully generates creative images

modalities by mapping distributed vectors of one modality to the other, or to a
shared space. The predicted vectors are then used to perform e.g., retrieval or
labeling. Thus, the success of the whole system relies on the ability of the
mapping to make the neighborhood structure (i.e., the pairwise similarities) of
the predicted vectors akin to that of the target vectors. However, whether this
is achieved has not been investigated yet. Here, we propose a new similarity
measure and two ad hoc experiments to shed light on this issue. In three
cross-modal benchmarks we learn a large number of language-to-vision and
vision-to-language neural network mappings (up to five layers) using a rich
diversity of image and text features and loss functions. Our results reveal
that, surprisingly, the neighborhood structure of the predicted vectors
consistently resembles more that of the input vectors than that of the target
vectors. In a second experiment, we further show that untrained nets do not
significantly disrupt the neighborhood (i.e., semantic) structure of the input
vectors.

that, under the evaluation of this determinant map, the image of a higher rho

a consequence, we show that if the Baum-Connes conjecture holds for a group,

also generalize Lott's delocalized eta invariant to the case where the

a 3D coefficient inverse problem with scattering data generated by a single
direction of the incident plane wave. This inverse problem is well-known to be
a highly nonlinear and ill-posed problem. Therefore, optimization-based
reconstruction methods for solving this problem would typically suffer from the
local-minima trapping and require strong a priori information of the solution.
To avoid these problems, in our numerical method, we aim to construct a cost
functional with a globally strictly convex property, whose minimizer can
provide a good approximation for the exact solution of the inverse problem. The
key ingredients for the construction of such functional are an
integro-differential formulation of the inverse problem and a Carleman weight
function. Under a (partial) finite difference approximation, the global strict
convexity is proven using the tool of Carleman estimates. The global
convergence of the gradient projection method to the exact solution is proven
as well. We demonstrate the efficiency of our reconstruction method via a
numerical study of experimental backscatter data for buried objects.

extracting knowledge from event logs data which recorded during drug discovery

Research UK (CRUK) as it was being executed. It provides the evaluations and
methodologies of drawing the process mining panoramic models for the drug

from the process mining methodologies. Disco is excellent for non-experts on

the process mining is not once and for all but is a regular operation
management process. Indeed, event logs needs to be understand more on the

the previous $O\left( \log^{3/2} n \right)$ bound of Rahul [SODA 2015]. We

optimal query cost, and also the first linear-space data structure in the word
RAM model with sub-logarithmic query time.
  -We give the first linear-space data structure that supports 3-d $4$-sided

closely related problem of 2-d top-$k$ rectangle stabbing in the word RAM

based on an interesting variant of the van Emde Boas recursion, applied in a
round-robin fashion over the dimensions, combined with bit-packing techniques.

combining both linear and nonlinear terms, this tracking differentiator shows
better dynamical performances than other conventional differentiators do. The
hyperbolic tangent tanh(.) function is introduced due to two reasons; firstly,
the high slope of the continuous tanh(.) function near the origin significantly
accelerates the convergence of the proposed tracking differentiator and reduces
the chattering phenomenon. Secondly, the saturation feature of the function due
to its nonlinearity increases the robustness against the noise components in
the signal. The stability of the suggested tracking differentiator is proven
based on the Lyapunov analysis. In addition, a frequency-based analysis is
applied to investigate the dynamical performances. The performance of the
proposed tracking differentiator has been tested in active disturbance
rejection control (ADRC) paradigm, which is a recent robust control technique.
The numerical simulations emphasize the expected improvements.

the standard relativity theory, is based on the relativity principle and the
universality of the (two-way) speed of light but includes a privileged frame as
an essential element. It is developed using the following first principles: (1)
Anisotropy of the one-way speed of light in an inertial frame is due to its
motion with respect to the privileged frame; (2) Space-time transformations
between inertial frames leave the equation of anisotropic light propagation
invariant; (3) A set of the transformations possesses a group structure. The
Lie group theory apparatus is applied to define groups of transformations. The
correspondingly modified general relativity (GR), like the standard GR, is
based on the equivalence principle but with the properly modified space-time
local symmetry in which an invariant combination differs from the Minkowski
interval of the standard SR. Applying the modified GR to cosmology yields the
luminosity distance -- redshift relation corrected such that the observed
deceleration parameter can be negative as it was derived from the data for type
Ia supernovae. Thus, the observed negative values of the deceleration parameter
can be explained without introducing the dark energy. A number of other
observations, such as Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) also can be well fit to the cosmological model arising from
