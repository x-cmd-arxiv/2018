WIMP-like thermal relic with a mass of ${\cal O}$(100 GeV), but it still
escapes direct detection. This happens, if the dark matter particle is a
Goldstone boson whose scattering with ordinary matter is suppressed at low
energy due to momentum-dependent interactions. We outline general features of
this type of models and analyse a simple realization of these dynamics as a
concrete example. In particular, we show that although direct detection of this
type of dark matter candidate is very challenging, the indirect detection can
already provide relevant constraints. Future projections of the
indirect-detection experiments allow for even more stringent exclusion limits
and can rule out models of this type.

Aharonov-Bohm ring which is exposed to a synthetic gauge field. The presence of
disorder within the ring gives rise to Al'tshuler-Aronov-Spivak oscillations,
seen in the disorder average of the transmission as a function of the effective
gauge flux that is contained within the ring. Those oscillations are induced by
coherent backscattering and represent a manifestation of weak localization.
Through analytical and numerical calculations that are based on the mean-field
Gross-Pitaevskii approximation for the propagating Bose-Einstein condensate, we
show that the presence of a very weak atom-atom interaction within the ring
leads to an inversion of the Al'tshuler-Aronov-Spivak oscillations, in a very
similar manner as for the coherent backscattering of Bose-Einstein condensates
within two-dimensional disorder potentials. Numerical simulations based on the
Truncated Wigner method reveal that this signature of weak antilocalization
becomes washed out if the interaction strength is increased.

(LMC) in the 12CO J=1-0 line using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA). The sample includes four GMCs with some signs of star formation
-- either YSOs, H II regions, and/or young clusters -- and one quiescent GMC
without any sign of massive star formation. The data from the ALMA 12 m, 7 m,
and Total-Power arrays are jointly deconvolved to obtain high-fidelity images
at high spatial resolution (3 arcsec = 0.7 pc). The four star-forming GMCs show
very complex structures with clumps and filaments. The quiescent GMC shows a
relatively diffuse, extended emission distribution without prominent clumps or
filaments. This difference is similar to that between structured molecular gas
in Milky Way spiral arms and unstructured gas in the inter-arm regions. We
characterize the difference with the brightness distribution function and
brightness distribution index. In conjunction with other ALMA studies of GMCs
in the LMC, the five GMCs tentatively form an evolutionary trend: from less
structured, quiescent GMCs to more structured, actively star-forming GMCs. A
future ALMA study will be able to map molecular clouds over the LMC and reveal
the evolutionary sequence of molecular clouds.

understand emergent order in far-from-equilibrium systems. While at
equilibrium, temperature plays the role of a key thermodynamic variable whose
uniformity in space and time defines the equilibrium state the system is in,
this is not the case in a far-from-equilibrium driven system. When energy flows
through a finite system at steady-state, temperature takes on a
time-independent but spatially varying character. In this study, the convection
patterns of a Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard fluid cell at steady-state is used as a
prototype system where the temperature profile and fluctuations are measured
spatio-temporally. The thermal data is obtained by performing high-resolution
real-time infrared calorimetry on the convection system as it is first driven
out-of-equilibrium when the power is applied, achieves steady-state, and then
as it gradually relaxes back to room temperature equilibrium when the power is
removed. Our study provides new experimental data on the non-trivial nature of
thermal fluctuations when stable complex convective structures emerge. The
thermal analysis of these convective cells at steady-state further yield local
equilibrium-like statistics. In conclusion, these results correlate the spatial
ordering of the convective cells with the evolution of the system's temperature
manifold.

computation of a rank-revealing factorization of a large matrix. In many of
these instances the classical algorithms for computing the singular value

singular value decomposition can often be helpful, but is not effective unless
the numerical rank of the matrix is substantially smaller than the dimensions
of the matrix. We introduce a new randomized algorithm for producing
rank-revealing factorizations based on existing work by Demmel, Dumitriu and
Holtz [Numerische Mathematik, 108(1), 2007] that excels in this regime. The
method is exceptionally easy to implement, and results in close-to optimal
low-rank approximations to a given matrix. The vast majority of floating point
operations are executed in level-3 BLAS, which leads to high computational
speeds. The performance of the method is illustrated via several numerical
experiments that directly compare it to alternative techniques such as the
column pivoted QR factorization, or the QLP method by Stewart.

In this paper, we present a method to assess the effect of some initial spatial

generator in order to create density grids with which spatial simulation models
are initialised. We show, with the example of two classical agent-based models
(Schelling's models of segregation and Sugarscape's model of unequal societies)

that the effect of initial spatial arrangements is significant on the two

contained in the set of canonical forms. Thus, typability alone is not
sufficient to characterize solvability, in contrast to the case for the

provides a full characterization of solvability, in the sense that a term is

inhabited. We complete the picture by providing an algorithm for the

galaxies to perform a systematic study of the dependence of $\varphi$ on galaxy
morphology, mass, and kinematics to investigate the physical origin of spiral
arms. We find that $\varphi$ decreases (arms are more tightly wound), albeit
with significant scatter, in galaxies with earlier Hubble type, more prominent
bulges, higher concentration, and larger total galaxy stellar mass ($M_*^{\rm
gal}$). For a given concentration, galaxies with larger stellar masses tend to
have tighter spiral arms, and vice versa. We also find that $\varphi$ obeys a
tight inverse correlation with central stellar velocity dispersion for
$\sigma_c$$\gtrsim$$100$ km s$^{-1}$, whereas $\varphi$ remains approximately
constant for $\sigma_c\lesssim100$ km s$^{-1}$. We demonstrate that the
$\varphi$-$\sigma_c$ and $\varphi$-$M_*^{\rm gal}$ relations are projections of
a more fundamental three-dimensional $\varphi-\sigma_c-M_*^{\rm gal}$ relation,
such that pitch angle is determined by $\sigma_c$ for massive galaxies but by
$M_*^{\rm gal}$ for less massive galaxies. Contrary to previous studies, we
find that $\varphi$ correlates only loosely with the galaxy's shear rate. For a
given shear rate, spirals generated from $N$-body simulations exhibit much
higher $\varphi$ than observed, suggesting that galactic disks are dynamically
cooler (Toomre's $Q \approx 1.2$). Instead, the measured pitch angles show a
much stronger relation with morphology of the rotation curve of the central
region, such that galaxies with centrally peaked rotation curves have tight
arms, while those with slow-rising rotation curves have looser arms. These
behaviors are qualitatively consistent with predictions of density wave theory.

reasoner is invoked for verification of newly introduced changes, therewith
amounting to a time-consuming test-last approach. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
for ontology authoring is a recent {\em test-first} approach that aims to
reduce authoring time and increase authoring efficiency. Current TDD testing
falls short on coverage of OWL features and possible test outcomes, the
rigorous foundation thereof, and evaluations to ascertain its effectiveness.
  We aim to address these issues in one instantiation of TDD for ontology
authoring. We first propose a succinct, logic-based model of TDD testing and
present novel TDD algorithms so as to cover also any OWL 2 class expression for
the TBox and for the principal ABox assertions, and prove their correctness.
The algorithms use methods from the OWL API directly such that reclassification
is not necessary for test execution, therewith reducing ontology authoring
time. The algorithms were implemented in TDDonto2, a Prot\'eg\'e plugin.
TDDonto2 was evaluated on editing efficiency and by users. The editing
efficiency study demonstrated that it is faster than a typical ontology
authoring interface, especially for medium size and large ontologies. The user
evaluation demonstrated that modellers make significantly less errors with
TDDonto2 compared to the standard Prot\'eg\'e interface and complete their
tasks better using less time. Thus, the results indicate that Test-Driven
Development is a promising approach in an ontology development methodology.

two weakly coupled superconductors, known as the Josephson effect, plays a
foundational role in basic physics and applications to metrology, precision
sensing, high-speed digital electronics, and quantum computing. The junction
ranges from planar insulating oxides to single atoms, molecules, semiconductor
nanowires, and generally to any finite-size coherent conductor. Recently,
junctions of more than two superconducting terminals gained broad attention in
the context of braiding of Majorana fermions in the solid state for
fault-tolerant quantum computing, and accessing physics and topology in
dimensions higher than three. Here we report the first observation of Josephson
effect in 3- and 4-terminal junctions, fabricated in a top-down fashion from a
semiconductor/superconductor (InAs/Al) epitaxial two-dimensional
heterostructure. Due to interactions, the critical current of an N-terminal
junction becomes the boundary of an (N-1)-dimensional manifold of
simultaneously allowed supercurrents. The measured shapes of such manifolds are
explained by the scattering theory of mesoscopic superconductivity, and they
can be remarkably sensitive to the junction's symmetry class. Furthermore, we
observed a notably high-order (up to 8) multiple Andreev reflections
simultaneously across every terminals pair, which verifies the multi-terminal
nature of normal scattering and a high interface quality in our devices. Given
the previously shown gate-control of carrier density and evidence of spin-orbit
scattering in InAs/Al heterostructures, and device compatibility with other 2D
materials, the multi-terminal Josephson effect reported here can become a
testbed for physics and applications of topological superconductivity.

$e^+e^-$ collider under development at CERN. Following the CLIC conceptual
design published in 2012, this report provides an overview of the CLIC project,
its current status, and future developments. It presents the CLIC physics
potential and reports on design, technology, and implementation aspects of the
accelerator and the detector. CLIC is foreseen to be built and operated in
stages, at centre-of-mass energies of 380 GeV, 1.5 TeV and 3 TeV, respectively.
CLIC uses a two-beam acceleration scheme, in which 12 GHz accelerating
structures are powered via a high-current drive beam. For the first stage, an
alternative with X-band klystron powering is also considered. CLIC accelerator
optimisation, technical developments and system tests have resulted in an
increased energy efficiency (power around 170 MW) for the 380 GeV stage,
together with a reduced cost estimate at the level of 6 billion CHF. The
detector concept has been refined using improved software tools. Significant
progress has been made on detector technology developments for the tracking and
calorimetry systems. A wide range of CLIC physics studies has been conducted,
both through full detector simulations and parametric studies, together
providing a broad overview of the CLIC physics potential. Each of the three
energy stages adds cornerstones of the full CLIC physics programme, such as
Higgs width and couplings, top-quark properties, Higgs self-coupling, direct
searches, and many precision electroweak measurements. The interpretation of
the combined results gives crucial and accurate insight into new physics,
largely complementary to LHC and HL-LHC. The construction of the first CLIC
energy stage could start by 2026. First beams would be available by 2035,
marking the beginning of a broad CLIC physics programme spanning 25-30 years.

can accrete gas through a disk and become active. These Active Galactic Nuclei,
AGN, can form jets which are observed on scales from AU to Mpc and from meter
wavelengths to TeV gamma ray energies. High resolution radio imaging and
multi-wavelength/messenger campaigns are elucidating the conditions under which
this happens. Evidence is presented that: AGN jets are formed when the black
hole spins and the accretion disk is strongly magnetized, perhaps on account of
gas accretingat high latitude beyond the black hole sphere of influence; AGN
jets are collimated close to the black hole by magnetic stress associated with
a disk wind; higher power jets can emerge from their galactic nuclei in a
relativistic, supersonic and proton-dominated state and they terminate in
strong, hot spot shocks; lower power jets are degraded to buoyant plumes and
bubbles; jets may accelerate protons to EeV energies which contribute to the
cosmic ray spectrum and which may initiate pair cascades that can efficiently
radiate synchrotron gamma rays; jets were far more common when the universe was
a few billion years old and black holes and massive galaxies were growing
rapidly; jets can have a major influence on their environments, stimulating and
limiting the growth of galaxies. The observational prospects for securing our
understanding of AGN jets are bright.

simultaneously provide a qualitatively correct correlation between environment

relationship to frequencies. In particular, there exist serious difficulties in
finding factorizations of belief functions from data.
  In probability theory factorizations are usually related to notion of
(conditional) independence and their possibility tested accordingly. However,
in DST conditional belief distributions prove to be non-proper belief functions
(that is ones connected with negative ""frequencies""). This makes statistical
testing of potential conditional independencies practically impossible, as no
coherent interpretation could be found so far for negative belief function
values.
  In this paper a novel attempt is made to overcome this difficulty. In the
proposal no conditional beliefs are calculated, but instead a new measure F is
introduced within the framework of DST, closely related to conditional
independence, allowing to apply conventional statistical tests for detection of
dependence/independence.

in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. This approach is based on performing
local averages of the physical fields, which amounts to filtering scales
smaller than some parameter $\ell$. A key step in this work is the derivation
of a local K\'arm\'an-Howarth-Monin relation which provides a local form of
Politano and Pouquet's 4/3-law, without any assumption of homogeneity or
isotropy. Our approach is exact, non-random, and we show its connection to the
usual statistical results of turbulence. Its implementation on data obtained
via a three dimensional direct numerical simulation of the forced,
incompressible MHD equations from the John Hopkins turbulence database
constitutes the main part of our study. First, we show that the local
K\'arm\'an-Howarth-Monin relation holds well. The space statistics of local
cross-scale transfers is studied next, their means and standard deviations
being maximum at inertial scales, and their probability density functions
(PDFs) displaying very wide tails. Events constituting the tails of the PDFs
are shown to form structures of strong transfers, either positive or negative,
and which can be observed over the whole available range of scales. As $\ell$
is decreased, these structures become more and more localized in space while
contributing to an increasing fraction of the mean energy cascade rate.
Finally, we highlight their quasi 1D (filament-like) or quasi 2D
(sheet/ribbon-lke) nature, and show that they appear in areas of strong
vorticity or electric current density.

[\textit{J. Chem. Phys.} {\bf 136}, 184303 (2012)] are refitted as BOPES75K,
which reproduces the energies below dissociation with a root mean square
deviation of 0.05~\cm; points between dissociation and 75\,000 \cm\ are
reproduced with the average accuracy of a few wavenumbers. The new PES75K+
potential combines BOPES75K with adiabatic, relativistic and quantum
electrodynamics (QED) surfaces to provide the most accurate representation of
the \hp\ global potential to date, overcoming the limitations on previous high
accuracy H$_3^+$ PESs near and above dissociation. PES75K+ can be used to
provide predictions of bound rovibrational energy levels with an accuracy of
approaching 0.1~\cm. Calculation of rovibrational energy levels within PES75K+
suggests that the non-adiabatic correction remains a limiting factor. The PES
is also constructed to give the correct asymptotic limit making it suitable for
use in studies of the H$^+$\,+\,H$_2$ prototypical chemical reaction. An
improved dissociation energy for H$_3^+$ is derived as
$D_0\,=\,$35\,076\,$\pm\,2\,$cm$^{-1}$.

field states are not well separated from the excited ones and thus are
insufficient to describe the low-temperature magnetic properties. Inspired by
this simple observation, we develop a microscopic theory to describe the
magnetic physics due to the collapses of the weak crystal field states. We find
two cases where the excited crystal field states should be seriously included
into the theory. One case is when the bandwidth of the excited crystal field
states is comparable to the crystal field gap. The other case is when the
exchange energy gain between the low-lying and excited crystal field states
overcomes the crystal field gap. Both cases could drive a phase transition and
result in magnetic orders by involving the excited crystal field states. We dub
the above physics as upper branch magnetism and phase transition. We discuss
the multitude of magnetic phases and the emergent selection rules for the
detection of the underlying excitations. We expect our results to help improve
the understanding of many rare-earth magnets with weak crystal field gaps such
as Tb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ and Tb$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$, and also provide a complementary
perspective to the prevailing local ""$J$"" physics in $4d$/$5d$ magnets.

Combining these networks requires dealing with ambiguous nodes, as nodes
represent written descriptions of causes and effects and different descriptions
may exist for the same concept. We introduce NetFUSES, a method for combining

attributions networks as independent samples allows us to use their overlap to
estimate the total size of the collective causal attribution network. We find

salts affect the spinodal decomposition of binary fluid mixtures. We find that
spinodal decomposition is arrested and complex structures form only when
electrostatic ion-ion interactions are small. In this case fluid and ion
concentrations couple and the charge field can be approximated as a polynomial
function of the relative fluid concentrations alone. When the solvation energy
associated with transfering an ion from one fluid phase to the other is of the
order of a few k_BT, the coupled fluid and charge fields evolve according to
the Ohta-Kawasaki free energy functional. This allows us to accurately predict
structure sizes and reduce the parameter space to two dimensionless numbers.
The lamellar structures induced by the presence of antagonistic salt in our
simulations exhibit a high degree of nematic ordering and the growth of ordered
domains over time seems to follow a power law. This power law carries a time
exponent proportional to the salt concentration. We reproduce and interpret
neutron scattering data from previous experiments of similar systems. The
dissolution of structures at high salt concentrations observed in these
experiments agrees with our simulations and we explain it as the result of a
vanishing surface tension due to electrostatic contributions. We conclude by
presenting preliminary 3D results showing the same morphologies as predicted by
the Ohta-Kawasaki model as a function of volume fraction and suggesting that
our findings from 2D systems remain valid in 3D.

primitive. However, it is impossible for block encryption to achieve the same
security as one-time pad. Quantum mechanics has changed the modern
cryptography, and lots of researches have shown that quantum cryptography can
outperform the limitation of traditional cryptography.
  This article proposes a new constructive mode for private quantum encryption,
named $\mathcal{EHE}$, which is a very simple method to construct quantum
encryption from classical primitive. Based on $\mathcal{EHE}$ mode, we
construct a quantum block encryption (QBE) scheme from pseudorandom functions.
If the pseudorandom functions are standard secure, our scheme is
indistinguishable encryption under chosen plaintext attack. If the pseudorandom
functions are permutation on the key space, our scheme can achieve perfect
security. In our scheme, the key can be reused and the randomness cannot, so a
$2n$-bit key can be used in an exponential number of encryptions, where the
randomness will be refreshed in each time of encryption. Thus $2n$-bit key can
perfectly encrypt $O(n2^n)$ qubits, and the perfect secrecy would not be broken
if the $2n$-bit key is reused for only exponential times.
  Comparing with quantum one-time pad (QOTP), our scheme can be the same secure
as QOTP, and the secret key can be reused (no matter whether the eavesdropping
exists or not). Thus, the limitation of perfectly secure encryption (Shannon's
theory) is broken in the quantum setting. Moreover, our scheme can be viewed as
a positive answer to the open problem in quantum cryptography ""how to
unconditionally reuse or recycle the whole key of private-key quantum
encryption"". In order to physically implement the QBE scheme, we only need to
implement two kinds of single-qubit gates (Pauli $X$ gate and Hadamard gate),
so it is within reach of current quantum technology.

distance computation on triangle meshes. Our key observation is that the
recovery of geodesic distance with the heat method from [Crane et al. 2013] can
be reformulated as optimization of its gradients subject to integrability,
which can be solved using an efficient first-order method that requires no
linear system solving and converges quickly. Afterward, the geodesic distance
is efficiently recovered by parallel integration of the optimized gradients in
breadth-first order. Moreover, we employ a similar breadth-first strategy to
derive a parallel Gauss-Seidel solver for the diffusion step in the heat
method. To further lower the memory consumption from gradient optimization on
faces, we also propose a formulation that optimizes the projected gradients on
edges, which reduces the memory footprint by about 50%. Our approach is
trivially parallelizable, with a low memory footprint that grows linearly with
respect to the model size. This makes it particularly suitable for handling
large models. Experimental results show that it can efficiently compute
geodesic distance on meshes with more than 200 million vertices on a desktop PC

(LV) quantification using convolutional neural networks (CNN).
  Methods: The general framework consists of one CNN for detecting the LV, and
another for tissue classification. Also, three new deep learning architectures
were proposed for LV quantification. These new CNNs introduce the ideas of
sparsity and depthwise separable convolution into the U-net architecture, as
well as, a residual learning strategy level-to-level. To this end, we extend
the classical U-net architecture and use the generalized Jaccard distance as
optimization objective function.
  Results: The CNNs were trained and evaluated with 140 patients from two
public cardiovascular magnetic resonance datasets (Sunnybrook and Cardiac Atlas
Project) by using a 5-fold cross-validation strategy. Our results demonstrate a
suitable accuracy for myocardial segmentation ($\sim$0.9 Dice's coefficient),
and a strong correlation with the most relevant physiological measures: 0.99
for end-diastolic and end-systolic volume, 0.97 for the left myocardial mass,
0.95 for the ejection fraction and 0.93 for the stroke volume and cardiac
output.
  Conclusion: Our simulation and clinical evaluation results demonstrate the
capability and merits of the proposed CNN to estimate different structural and
functional features such as LV mass and EF which are commonly used for both
diagnosis and treatment of different pathologies.
  Significance: This paper suggests a new approach for automatic LV
quantification based on deep learning where errors are comparable to the inter-
and intra-operator ranges for manual contouring. Also, this approach may have
important applications on motion quantification.

path of more than 90 degrees on the sky. We also provide updated tracks for the
sky position, distance, and radial velocity of the stream. Our tracks in these
latter dimensions mostly agree with previous results. However, there are
significant corrections to the earlier distance and latitude tracks as the
stream approaches the Galactic disk. Stream stars selected with
three-dimensional kinematics display a very tight red giant sequence.
Concordantly, we find that applying a proper motion cut removes the most
metal-rich stars from earlier spectroscopic samples of stream stars, though a
significant dispersion remains indicating a dwarf galaxy origin. The
deceleration of the stream towards its leading end suggests a circular velocity
of ~200 km/s at a galactocentric radius ~30 kpc, consistent with other
independent evidence. However, the track of the stream departs significantly
from an orbit; the spatial track does not point along the same direction as the
velocity vector, and it exhibits a lateral wiggle that is unlikely to match any
reasonable orbit. The low metallicity and small dispersion of the stream in the

scalar SGWB to predominantly arise from stellar collapses. These collapses not
only take place at higher astrophysical rates, but emit more energy. This is
because, unlike tensor radiation, which mainly starts from quadrupole order,
the scalar perturbation can be excited by changes in the monopole moment. In
particular, in the case of stellar collapse into a neutron star or a black
hole, the monopole radiation, at frequencies below 100\,Hz, is dominated by the
memory effect. At low frequencies, the scalar SGWB spectrum follows a power law
of $\Omega_\text{S}\propto f^\alpha$, with $\alpha = 1$. We predict that
$\Omega_\text{S}$ is inversely proportional to the square of $\omega_{\rm

applications ranging from feature presentation in a cinema setting to video on
demand to interactive video conferencing are in great demand. Good
synchronization between audio and video modalities is a key factor towards
defining the quality of a multimedia presentation. The audio and visual signals
of a multimedia presentation are commonly managed by independent workflows -
they are often separately authored, processed, stored and even delivered to the
playback system. This opens up the possibility of temporal misalignment between
the two modalities - such a tendency is often more pronounced in the case of
produced content (such as movies).
  To judge whether audio and video signals of a multimedia presentation are
synchronized, we as humans often pay close attention to discriminative
spatio-temporal blocks of the video (e.g. synchronizing the lip movement with
the utterance of words, or the sound of a bouncing ball at the moment it hits
the ground). At the same time, we ignore large portions of the video in which
no discriminative sounds exist (e.g. background music playing in a movie).
Inspired by this observation, we study leveraging attention modules for
automatically detecting audio-visual synchronization. We propose neural network
based attention modules, capable of weighting different portions
(spatio-temporal blocks) of the video based on their respective discriminative
power. Our experiments indicate that incorporating attention modules yields
state-of-the-art results for the audio-visual synchronization classification
problem.

the collective effects of Coulomb forces on the nonequilibrium dynamics and
aggregation process in a granular gas -- a model representative of the above
physical processes -- have so far evaded theoretical scrutiny. Here, we
establish a hydrodynamic description of aggregating granular gases that
exchange charges upon collisions and interact via the long-ranged Coulomb
forces. We analytically derive the governing equations for the evolution of
granular temperature, charge variance, and number density for homogeneous and
quasi-monodisperse aggregation. We find that, once the aggregates are formed,
the system obeys a physical constraint of nearly constant dimensionless ratio
of characteristic electrostatic to kinetic energy $\mathcal{B}(t)\le 1$. This
constraint on the collective evolution of charged clusters is confirmed both by
the theory and the detailed molecular dynamics simulations. The inhomogeneous
aggregation of monomers and clusters in their mutual electrostatic field
proceeds in a fractal manner. Our theoretical framework is extendable to more
precise charge exchange mechanism, a current focus of extensive
experimentation. Furthermore, it illustrates the collective role of long-ranged

technique was applied to the 180-{\mu}m long nanowire similar to those commonly

(SNSPD). A non-gaussian geometrical jitter appears as a wide almost uniform
probability distribution (histogram) of the delay time (latency) of the
nanowire response to detected photon. White electrical noise of the readout
electronics causes broadened, Gaussian shaped edges of the histogram.
Subtracting noise contribution, we found for the geometrical jitter a standard

distribution collapses into a much narrower Gaussian distribution with a

(KiDS) combined with the VISTA Kilo-Degree Infrared Galaxy Survey (VIKING).
This is the first time that a full optical to near-infrared data set has been
used for a wide-field cosmological weak lensing experiment. This unprecedented
data, spanning $450~$deg$^2$, allows us to improve significantly the estimation
of photometric redshifts, such that we are able to include robustly
higher-redshift sources for the lensing measurement, and - most importantly -
solidify our knowledge of the redshift distributions of the sources. Based on a
flat $\Lambda$CDM model we find $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm
m}/0.3}=0.737_{-0.036}^{+0.040}$ in a blind analysis from cosmic shear alone.
The tension between KiDS cosmic shear and the Planck-Legacy CMB measurements
remains in this systematically more robust analysis, with $S_8$ differing by
$2.3\sigma$. This result is insensitive to changes in the priors on nuisance
parameters for intrinsic alignment, baryon feedback, and neutrino mass. KiDS
shear measurements are calibrated with a new, more realistic set of image
simulations and no significant B-modes are detected in the survey, indicating
that systematic errors are under control. When calibrating our redshift
distributions by assuming the 30-band COSMOS-2015 photometric redshifts are
correct (following the Dark Energy Survey and the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey), we
find the tension with Planck is alleviated. The robust determination of source
redshift distributions remains one of the most challenging aspects for future
cosmic shear surveys.

comparisons, compared to the optical-only case at photo-$z$ above $0.7$. The
complementarity between our optical and NIR surveys means that over $80\%$ of
our sources, across all photo-$z$, have significant detections (i.e. not upper

masses for all sources in the survey, and verify these data products against
existing spectroscopic galaxy samples. We demonstrate the fidelity of our

relativistic quantum mechanics, and it is the basis of many quantum algorithms.
We investigate how it searches the complete bipartite graph of $N$ vertices for
one of $k$ marked vertices with different initial states. We prove intriguing
dependence on the number of marked and unmarked vertices in each partite set.
For example, when the graph is irregular and the initial state is the typical
uniform superposition over the vertices, then the success probability can vary
greatly from one timestep to the next, even alternating between 0 and 1, so the
precise time at which measurement occurs is crucial. When the initial state is
a uniform superposition over the edges, however, the success probability
evolves smoothly. As another example, if the complete bipartite graph is
regular, then the two initial states are equivalent. Then if two marked
vertices are in the same partite set, the success probability reaches 1/2, but
if they are in different partite sets, it instead reaches $1$. This differs
from the complete graph, which is the quantum walk formulation of Grover's
algorithm, where the success probability with two marked vertices is 8/9. This
reveals a contrast to the continuous-time quantum walk, whose evolution is
governed by Schr\""odinger's equation, which asymptotically searches the regular
complete bipartite graph with any arrangement of marked vertices in the same
manner as the complete graph.

parameter ($\eta$), based on [OII], [OIII], [SII], and [SIII] has been proposed
to estimate the hardening of the ionizing incident field of radiation, but the
simplest relation of this parameter with $T_*$ also depends on $U$ and
metallicity ($Z$). Here we provide a Bayesian-like code (HCm-Teff) that
compares the observed emission lines of $\eta$ with the predictions of a large
grid of photoionization models giving precise estimations of both $U$ and $T_*$

well-studied disc galaxies observed by the CHAOS collaboration. Our results
indicate that the observed radial decreasing of $\eta$ can be attributed to a
radial hardening of $T_*$, across galactic discs as in NGC~628 and NGC~5457. On
the other hand NGC~5194, which presents a positive slope of the fitting of the
softness parameter, has a flat slope in $T_*$. On the contrary the three
galaxies do not seem to present large radial variations of the ionization
parameter. When we inspect a larger sample of galaxies we observe steeper
radial variations of $T_*$ in less bright and later-type galaxies, mimicking a
similar trend observed for $Z$ but the studied sample should be enlarged to
obtain more statistically significant conclusions.

Motivated by the structure of heterotic and Horava-Witten theories, we suggest
an extension of the brane action by a particular 4-fermion operator that
resolves the above problems. Crucially, the UV divergence is cancelled and the
expected structure of the 4d effective action is reproduced. We believe that
attempts at a 10d description of KKLT have to be reconsidered in this new

the binary tidal deformability derived by the LIGO-Virgo detector network turns
out to be determined dominantly by the Hanford detector. Specifically, by
imposing the flat prior on tidal deformability of individual stars, symmetric
90% credible intervals of tilde{Lambda} are estimated to be 527^{+619}_{-345}
with the Hanford detector, 927^{+522}_{-619} with the Livingston detector, and
455^{+668}_{-281} with the LIGO-Virgo detector network. Furthermore, the

vary the maximum frequency of the data used in the analysis. This feature is
not observed for the Hanford detector. While they are all consistent, the
discrepancy and irregular behavior suggest that an in-depth study of noise

quantum many-body localisation (MBL) transition. Percolation rules are defined
for two models of disordered quantum spin-chains using their microscopic
quantum Hamiltonians and the topologies of the associated Fock-space graphs.
The percolation transition is revealed by the statistics of Fock-space cluster
sizes, obtained by exact enumeration for finite-sized systems. As a function of
disorder strength, the typical cluster size shows a transition from a volume
law in Fock space to sub-volume law, directly analogous to the behaviour of
eigenstate participation entropies across the MBL transition. Finite-size
scaling analyses for several diagnostics of cluster size statistics yield
mutually consistent critical properties. We show further that local observables
averaged over Fock-space clusters also carry signatures of the transition, with
their behaviour across it in direct analogy to that of corresponding eigenstate
expectation values across the MBL transition. The Fock-space clusters can be
explored under a mapping to kinetically constrained models. Dynamics within
this framework likewise show the ergodicity-breaking transition via Monte Carlo
averaged local observables, and yield critical properties consistent with those
obtained from both exact cluster enumeration and analytic results derived in
our recent work [arXiv:1812.05115]. This mapping allows access to system sizes
two orders of magnitude larger than those accessible in exact enumerations.
Simple physical pictures based on freezing of local real-space segments of
spins are also presented, and shown to give values for the critical disorder
strength and correlation length exponent $\nu$ consistent with numerical

still unable to reach this conclusion. I will demonstrate that even in the
presence of pion loops, as large as advocated recently by Gilbert and Pich, the
value of $\epsilon^\prime/\epsilon$ is significantly below the data, when the
main non-factorizable QCD dynamics at long distance scales, represented in DQCD

within the SM, which should include in addition to the correct matching between
long and short distance contributions, isospin breaking effects, NNLO QCD
corrections to both QCD penguin and electroweak penguin contributions and final
state interactions. Such final SM result will probably be known from lattice
QCD only in the middle of 2020s, but already in 2019 we should be able to see

radially, $\log_{10}(\mathrm{GDR}) = -0.043(\pm0.038) \,\mathrm{R [kpc]} +
1.88(\pm0.15)$, a much lower GDR than found in the Milky Way, and a
correspondingly higher $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ factor. The mass function of these
clouds follows a slope proportional to M$^{-2.84}$, steeper than many previous
studies of GMCs in local galaxies, implying that M33 is poorer at forming
massive clouds than other nearby spirals. Whilst we can rule out interstellar
pressure as the major contributing factor, we are unable to disentangle the
relative effects of metallicity and HI velocity dispersion. We find a
reasonably featureless number density profile with galactocentric radius, and
weak correlations between galactocentric radius and dust temperature/mass.
These clouds are reasonably consistent with Larson's scaling relationships, and
many of our sources are co-spatial with earlier CO studies. Massive clouds are
identified at large galactocentric radius, unlike in these earlier studies,
perhaps indicating a population of CO-dark gas dominated clouds at these larger

by a many-body scattering Hamiltonian which describes an exciton immersed in a

effective scattering potential, and optical spectra are calculated by solving
for the exciton Green's function. From this approach, a trion state can be
assigned as a bound state of an electron-exciton scattering process, and the
doping-dependent phenomena observed in the spectra can be attributed to several
many-body effects induced by the interaction with the Fermi sea. While the
many-body scattering Hamiltonian can not solved exactly, we reduce the problem
to two limiting solvable situations. The first approach approximates the full
many-body problem by a simple scattering process between the electron and the
exciton, with a self-energy obtained by solving a Bethe-Salpeter equation
(BSE). An alternate approach assumes an infinite mass for the exciton, such
that the many-body scattering Hamiltonian reduces to a Mahan-Nozieres-De
Dominicis (MND) model. The exciton Green's function can then be solved
numerically exactly by a determinantal formulation, and the optical spectra
show signatures of the Fermi-edge singularity at high doping densities. The
full doping dependence and temperature dependence of the exciton and trion
lineshapes are simulated via these two approximate approaches, with the results
compared to each other and to experimental expectations.

timescale over which clusters separate from their birth clouds. The star
cluster catalogues are from the Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS) and the
molecular clouds from the Plateau de Bure Interefrometer Arcsecond Whirpool
Survey (PAWS). We find that younger star clusters are spatially closer to
molecular clouds than older star clusters. The median ages for clusters
associated with clouds is 4~Myr whereas it is 50~Myr for clusters that are
sufficiently separated from a molecular cloud to be considered unassociated.
After $\sim$6~Myr, the majority of the star clusters lose association with
their molecular gas. Younger star clusters are also preferentially located in
stellar spiral arms where they are hierarchically distributed in kpc-size
regions for 50-100~Myr before dispersing. The youngest star clusters are more
strongly clustered, yielding a two-point correlation function with
$\alpha=-0.28\pm0.04$, than the GMCs ($\alpha=-0.09\pm0.03$) within the same
PAWS field. However, the clustering strength of the most massive GMCs,
supposedly the progenitors of the young clusters for a star formation
efficiency of a few percent, is comparable ($\alpha=-0.35\pm0.05$) to that of
the clusters. We find a galactocentric-dependence for the coherence of star
formation, in which clusters located in the inner region of the galaxy reside
in smaller star-forming complexes and display more homogeneous distributions
than clusters further from the centre. This result suggests a correlation
between the survival of a cluster complex and its environment.

quadratic term in momentum, while the other modifies it with terms both linear

uncertainty, here the GUP modified broadening rates, for both deformations, not
only depend on the initial size (both in position and momentum space) of the
wave-packet, but also on the initial probability distribution and momentum of
the particle. The new rates of wave-packet broadening, for both situations, are
modified by a handful of new terms - such as the skewness and kurtosis
coefficients, as well as the (constant) momentum of the particle. Comparisons

potentially measurable differences in the rates of free wave-packet broadening

formed a stellar cluster with large-scale inward flows (fast mode), while
L1521D, a core embedded in a filament, is slowly contracting due to its
self-gravity (slow mode). There is also one isolated core that appears to be

neutrino masses, the baryon asymmetry of the Universe and Dark Matter, within a

prime role. Indeed by just introducing two RH neutrinos we can generate the
neutrino masses by the Type-I seesaw mechanism. The baryon asymmetry of the
Universe can arise from thermal leptogenesis from the decay of lightest RH
neutrino before the decoupling of the electroweak sphaleron transitions, which
redistribute the $ B-L $ number into a baryon number. At the same time, the
decay of the RH neutrino can produce the Dark Matter (DM) as an asymmetric Dark
Matter component. The source of CP violation in the two sectors is exactly the
same, related to the complex couplings of the neutrinos. By determining the
comoving number density for different values of the CP violation in the DM
sector, we obtain a particular value of the DM mass after satisfying the relic
density bound. We also give prediction for the DM direct detection (DD) in the
near future by different ongoing DD experiments.

Improvements in electromagnetic and gravitational wave sensing instruments
continue to enhance the accuracy with which they can measure the masses, radii,
and tidal deformability of neutron stars. These better measurements place
tighter constraints on the equation of state of cold matter above nuclear
density. In this article, we discuss a complementary approach to get insights
into the structure of neutron stars by providing a model prediction for
non-linear fundamental eigenmodes (f-modes) and their decay over time, which
are thought to be induced by time-dependent tides in neutron star binaries.
Building on pioneering studies that relate the properties of f-modes to the
structure of neutron stars, we systematically study this link in the
non-perturbative regime using models that utilize numerical relativity. Using a
suite of fully relativistic numerical relativity simulations of oscillating TOV
stars, we establish blueprints for the numerical accuracy needed to accurately
compute the frequency and damping times of f-mode oscillations, which we expect
to be a good guide for the requirements in the binary case. We show that the
resulting f-mode frequencies match established results from linear perturbation
theory, but the damping times within numerical errors depart from linear
predictions. This work lays the foundation for upcoming studies aimed at a
comparison of theoretical models of f-mode signatures in gravitational waves,
and their uncertainties with actual gravitational wave data, searching for
neutron star binaries on highly eccentric orbits, and probing neutron star

perform a variable amount of work (systems heterogeneity). Practically, we
demonstrate that FedProx allows for more robust convergence than FedAvg across

neighbouring sources to the mid-infrared fluxes we studied the nature and
environment of the outbursting object, and its photometric variations from 1983

100000-200000 years old protostar of 1.6-1.8 solar masses. Its 2-micron
brightness started rising between 1993 and 1998, reached a peak in 2009-2011,

suggest that the outburst was preceded by a decade-long, slow brightening in
the near-infrared. The actual accretion burst occurred between 2004 and 2007.

accretion rate from some 3.5\times 10^{-7} Msun yr^{-1} to 1.1 \times 10^{-4}

interpretation of the experimentally well known instability of coplanar crack
propagation in mode I+III. The interpretation relied on a stability analysis
based on analytical expressions of the stress intensity factors for a crack
slightly perturbed both within and out of its original plane, due to Gao and
Rice (1986) and Movchan et al. (1998), coupled with a double propagation
criterion combining Griffith's energetic condition and principle of local
symmetry. Under such assumptions instability modes were indeed evidenced for
values of the mode mixity ratio of the mode III to mode I stress intensity
factors applied remotely larger than some threshold depending only on Poisson's
ratio. Unfortunately, the predicted thresholds were much larger than those
generally observed for typical values of this material parameter. While the
subcritical character of the nonlinear bifurcation from coplanar to fragmented
fronts has been proposed as a possible explanation for this discrepancy (Chen
et al., 2015), we propose here an alternative explanation based on the
introduction of a constitutive relationship between the fracture energy and the
mode mixity ratio, which is motivated by experimental observations. By
reexamining the linear stability analysis of a planar propagating front, we
show that such a relationship suffices, provided that it is strong enough, to
lower significantly the threshold value of the mode mixity ratio for
instability so as to bring it in a range more consistent with experiments.
Interesting formulae are also derived for the distributions of the perturbed
stress intensity factors and energy release rate, in the special case of
perturbations of the crack surface and front obeying the principle of local

network for tracking, and shown excellent accuracy with high efficiency.
Nevertheless, previously proposed one-stage Siamese-RPN trackers degenerate in
presence of similar distractors and large scale variation. Addressing these
issues, we propose a multi-stage tracking framework, Siamese Cascaded RPN
(C-RPN), which consists of a sequence of RPNs cascaded from deep high-level to
shallow low-level layers in a Siamese network. Compared to previous solutions,
C-RPN has several advantages: (1) Each RPN is trained using the outputs of RPN
in the previous stage. Such process stimulates hard negative sampling,
resulting in more balanced training samples. Consequently, the RPNs are
sequentially more discriminative in distinguishing difficult background (i.e.,
similar distractors). (2) Multi-level features are fully leveraged through a
novel feature transfer block (FTB) for each RPN, further improving the
discriminability of C-RPN using both high-level semantic and low-level spatial
information. (3) With multiple steps of regressions, C-RPN progressively
refines the location and shape of the target in each RPN with adjusted anchor
boxes in the previous stage, which makes localization more accurate. C-RPN is
trained end-to-end with the multi-task loss function. In inference, C-RPN is
deployed as it is, without any temporal adaption, for real-time tracking. In
extensive experiments on OTB-2013, OTB-2015, VOT-2016, VOT-2017, LaSOT and

a matrix-element based linearized-Boltzmann transport and diffusion-based
Langevin equation, we have made two essential improvements to increase both the
flexibility and physical accuracy of the model. First, we have absorbed the
pQCD scatterings with small momentum transfers to the medium into the diffusion
part of the LIDO model, and we have restricted the use of vacuum matrix
elements to large momentum transfer processes. This study allows us to
construct a model that smoothly interpolates between a pure pQCD based approach
and a radiation-improved Langevin equation by tuning a single scale parameter.
Second, the Monte-Carlo implementation of the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect
of the original model has been improved to account for multiple scatterings of
gluons. The simulated radiative energy loss can be tuned to quantitatively
agree with semi-analytic theory calculations both for a static (finite /
infinite) medium and for a dynamic expanding medium. With such improvements,
the LIDO model will greatly facilitate the extraction of heavy-quark transport
coefficient from a systematic model-to-data comparison.

The dynamical space-time theories are introduced a vector field whose equation
of motion guarantees a conservation of a certain Energy Momentum tensor, which
may be related, but in general is not the same as the gravitational Energy
Momentum tensor. This particular energy momentum tensor is built from a general
combination of scalar fields derivatives as the kinetic terms, and possibly
potentials for the scalar field. By demanding that the dynamical space vector
field be the gradient of a scalar the dynamical space time theory becomes a
theory for diffusive interacting dark energy and dark matter. These
generalizations produce non-conserved energy momentum tensors instead of
conserved energy momentum tensors which leads at the end to a formulation for
interacting DE-DM. We solved analytically the theories and we show that the
$\Lambda$CDM is a fixed point of these theories at large times. A particular
case has asymptotic correspondence to previously studied non-Lagrangian
formulations of diffusive exchange between dark energy dark matter.

absence of broadband UV spectral observations, we constrain our models using
HST Ly$\alpha$ observations from TRAPPIST-1 and GALEX FUV and NUV photometric
detections from a set of old M8 stars ($>$1 Gyr). We find that calibrating the
models using both data sets separately yield similar FUV and NUV fluxes, and
EUV fluxes that range from (1.32 - 17.4) $\times$ 10$^{-14}$ ergs s$^{-1}$
cm$^{-2}$. The results from these models demonstrate that the EUV emission is
very sensitive to the temperature structure in the transition region. Our lower
activity models predict EUV fluxes similar to previously published estimates
derived from semi-empirical scaling relationships, while the highest activity
model predicts EUV fluxes a factor of ten higher. Results from this study
support the idea that the TRAPPIST-1 habitable zone planets likely do not have
much liquid water on their surfaces due to the elevated levels of high energy
radiation emitted by the host star.

feedforward neural networks with general activation functions. As such
feedforward networks are memoryless, they can be abstractly represented as
mathematical functions, and the reachability analysis of the neural network
amounts to interval analysis problems. In the framework of interval analysis, a
computationally efficient formula which can quickly compute the output interval
sets of a neural network is developed. Then, a specification-guided
reachability algorithm is developed. Specifically, the bisection process in the

Due to the employment of the safety specification, unnecessary computations are
avoided and thus the computational cost can be reduced significantly.
Experiments show that the proposed method enjoys much more efficiency in safety
verification with significantly less computational cost.

the data for computing Tikhonov-regularized solutions. We focus on very large
inverse problems where access to the entire data set is not possible all at
once (e.g., for problems with streaming or massive datasets). Row-access
methods provide an ideal framework for solving such problems, since they only
require access to ""blocks"" of the data at any given time. However, when using
these iterative sampling methods to solve inverse problems, the main challenges
include a proper choice of the regularization parameter, appropriate sampling
strategies, and a convergence analysis. To address these challenges, we first
describe a family of sampled iterative methods that can incorporate data as
they become available (e.g., randomly sampled). We consider two sampled
iterative methods, where the iterates can be characterized as solutions to a
sequence of approximate Tikhonov problems. The first method requires the
regularization parameter to be fixed a priori and converges asymptotically to
an unregularized solution for randomly sampled data. This is undesirable for
inverse problems. Thus, we focus on the second method where the main benefits
are that the regularization parameter can be updated during the iterative
process and the iterates converge asymptotically to a Tikhonov-regularized
solution. We describe adaptive approaches to update the regularization
parameter that are based on sampled residuals, and we describe a limited-memory
variant for larger problems. Numerical examples, including a large-scale
super-resolution imaging example, demonstrate the potential for these methods.

concave function of the achieved throughput or the experienced maximum delay.
The problem is important for supporting real-time multimedia traffic, and is
uniquely challenging due to the need of simultaneously considering maximum
delay constraints and throughput requirements. We first show that it is
NP-complete either (i) to construct a feasible solution strictly meeting all
constraints, or (ii) to obtain an optimal solution after we relax maximum delay
constraints or throughput requirements up to constant ratios. We then develop a
polynomial-time approximation algorithm named PASS. The design of PASS
leverages a novel understanding between non-convex maximum-delay-aware problems
and their convex average-delay-aware counterparts, which can be of independent
interest and suggest a new avenue for solving maximum-delay-aware network
optimization problems. Under realistic conditions, PASS achieves constant or
problem-dependent approximation ratios, at the cost of violating maximum delay
constraints or throughput requirements by up to constant or problem-dependent
ratios. PASS is practically useful since the conditions for PASS are satisfied
in many popular application scenarios. We empirically evaluate PASS using
extensive simulations of supporting video-conferencing traffic across Amazon
EC2 datacenters. Compared to existing algorithms and a conceivable baseline,
PASS obtains up to $100\%$ improvement of utilities, by meeting the throughput
requirements but relaxing the maximum delay constraints that are acceptable for
practical video conferencing applications.

eluded detection by traditional optical spectroscopic surveys aimed at finding
active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In this paper, we have modeled for the first
time the dependence of the optical narrow emission line strengths on the black
hole mass of accreting AGN over the range of $100-10^8M_{\odot}$. We show that
as the black hole mass decreases, the hardening of the spectral energy
distribution from the accretion disk changes the ionization structure of the
nebula. The enhanced high energy emission from IMBHs results in a more extended
partially ionized zone compared with models for higher mass black holes. This
effect produces a net decrease in the predicted [OIII]/H$\beta$ and
[NII]/H$\alpha$ emission line ratios. Based on this model, we demonstrate that
the standard optical narrow emission line diagnostics used to identify massive
black holes fail when black hole mass falls below $\approx10^4M_{\odot}$ for
highly accreting IMBHs and for radiatively inefficient IMBHs with active star
formation. Our models call into question the ability of common optical
spectroscopic diagnostics to confirm AGN candidates in dwarf galaxies, and
indicate that the low-mass black hole occupation fraction inferred from such

to help explain ASD and predict or monitor treatment outcomes. Toward this end,
deep learning classifiers have recently been used for identifying ASD from
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with higher accuracy than
traditional learning strategies. However, a key challenge with deep learning
models is understanding just what image features the network is using, which
can in turn be used to define the biomarkers. Current methods extract
biomarkers, i.e., important features, by looking at how the prediction changes
if ""ignoring"" one feature at a time. In this work, we go beyond looking at only
individual features by using Shapley value explanation (SVE) from cooperative
game theory. Cooperative game theory is advantageous here because it directly
considers the interaction between features and can be applied to any machine
learning method, making it a novel, more accurate way of determining
instance-wise biomarker importance from deep learning models. A barrier to
using SVE is its computational complexity: $2^N$ given $N$ features. We
explicitly reduce the complexity of SVE computation by two approaches based on
the underlying graph structure of the input data: 1) only consider the
centralized coalition of each feature; 2) a hierarchical pipeline which first
clusters features into small communities, then applies SVE in each community.
Monte Carlo approximation can be used for large permutation sets. We first
validate our methods on the MNIST dataset and compare to human perception.
Next, to insure plausibility of our biomarker results, we train a Random Forest
(RF) to classify ASD/control subjects from fMRI and compare SVE results to
standard RF-based feature importance. Finally, we show initial results on
ranked fMRI biomarkers using SVE on a deep learning classifier for the
ASD/control dataset.

analysis to FGK dwarfs. Using a suite of rotating model photospheres, we
explore spot and facula covering fractions for varying activity levels and the
associated stellar contamination spectra. Relative to M dwarfs, we find that
the typical variabilities of FGK dwarfs imply lower spot covering fractions,
though they generally increase with later spectral types, from $\sim 0.1\%$ for
F dwarfs to 2-4$\%$ for late-K dwarfs. While the stellar contamination spectra
are considerably weaker than those for typical M dwarfs, we find that typically
active G and K dwarfs produce visual slopes that are detectable in
high-precision transmission spectra. We examine line offsets at H$\alpha$ and
the Na and K doublets and find that unocculted faculae in K dwarfs can
appreciably alter transit depths around the Na D doublet. We find that
band-averaged transit depth offsets at molecular bands for CH$_{4}$, CO,
CO$_{2}$, H$_{2}$O, N$_{2}$O, O$_{2}$, and O$_{3}$ are not detectable for
typically active FGK dwarfs, though stellar TiO/VO features are potentially

that inactive FGK dwarfs do not produce detectable stellar contamination

that this so-called ""multimode strong coupling"" regime can be a powerful tool
to shape and control decoherence pathways through nontrivial forms of mode
hybridization. Using frequency- and time-domain measurements, we identify
hybridized modes with lifetimes that are significantly longer than that of any
mode of the uncoupled system. This surprising effect, which results from the
interference of decay channels, showcases the use of multimode strong coupling
as a general strategy to mitigate extrinsic loss mechanisms. Moreover, the
phonons supported by BAW resonators have a collection of properties, including
high frequencies, long coherence times, and robustness against thermal
decoherence, making this optomechanical system particularly enticing for
applications such as quantum transduction and memories. These results show that
our system can be used to study novel phenomena in a previously unexplored
regime of optomechanics and could be an important building block for future
quantum devices.

complexity is intractable in large-scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs). To
address these drawbacks, we propose a new damage identification approach that
utilizes the time-series of damage sensitive features extracted from multiple
sensors' measurements and the optimal change point detection theory to find
damage occurrence time and identify the number of damage locations. As the
existing change point detection methods require to centralize the sensor data,
which is impracticable in many applications, we use the probabilistic graphical
model to formulate WSNs and the targeting structure and propose a distributed
algorithm for structural damage identification. Validation results show highly

knowledge about the domain under investigation, which is formally expressed in
the form of a causal graph. In many practical settings, however, the knowledge
available for the researcher is not strong enough so as to specify a unique

to learn a qualitative description of the domain called a Markov equivalence

observed features. In this paper, we marry both approaches and study the
problem of causal identification from an equivalence class, represented by a
partial ancestral graph (PAG). We start by deriving a set of graphical
properties of PAGs that are carried over to its induced subgraphs. We then
develop an algorithm to compute the effect of an arbitrary set of variables on
an arbitrary outcome set. We show that the algorithm is strictly more powerful

is broadly important. This task is often challenging because solutions are
non-unique due to the complexity of the model and limited observation data.
However, the parameters or states of the model are often known to satisfy
additional constraints beyond the model. Thus, we propose an approach to
improve parameter estimation in such inverse problems by incorporating
constraints in a Bayesian inference framework. Constraints are imposed by
constructing a likelihood function based on fitness of the solution to the
constraints. The posterior distribution of the parameters conditioned on (1)
the observed data and (2) satisfaction of the constraints is obtained, and the
estimate of the parameters is given by the maximum a posteriori estimation or
posterior mean. Both equality and inequality constraints can be considered by
this framework, and the strictness of the constraints can be controlled by
constraint uncertainty denoting a confidence on its correctness. Furthermore,
we extend this framework to an approximate Bayesian inference framework in
terms of the ensemble Kalman filter method, where the constraint is imposed by
re-weighing the ensemble members based on the likelihood function. A synthetic
model is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and
in both the exact Bayesian inference and ensemble Kalman filter scenarios,
numerical simulations show that imposing constraints using the method presented
improves identification of the true parameter solution among multiple local
minima.

active field of research that targets the problem of realizing deep learning
models in hardware. However, most pruning methodologies tend to be
experimental, requiring large compute and time intensive iterations of
retraining the entire network. We introduce structure into model design by
proposing a single shot analysis of a trained network that serves as a first
order, low effort approach to dimensionality reduction, by using PCA (Principal
Component Analysis). The proposed method simultaneously analyzes the
activations of each layer and considers the dimensionality of the space
described by the filters generating these activations. It optimizes the
architecture in terms of number of layers, and number of filters per layer
without any iterative retraining procedures, making it a viable, low effort
technique to design efficient networks. We demonstrate the proposed methodology
on AlexNet and VGG style networks on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet
datasets, and successfully achieve an optimized architecture with a reduction
of up to 3.8X and 9X in the number of operations and parameters respectively,
while trading off less than 1% accuracy. We also apply the method to MobileNet,

Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = $2.76 TeV corresponds to a thermal yield
at the temperature around 155 MeV, which is too hot to keep deuterons bound.
This puzzle is not completely resolved yet. In general, the mechanism of light
nuclei production in ultra-high energy heavy ion collisions remains under
debate. In a previous work [1] we suggest a microscopic explanation of the
deuteron production in central ultra-relativistic Pb+Pb collisions, the main
mechanism being $\pi pn \leftrightarrow \pi d$ reactions in the hadronic phase
of the collision. We use a state-of-the-art hybrid approach, combining
relativistic hydrodynamics for the hot and dense stage and hadronic transport
for a later, more dilute stage. Deuteron rescattering in the hadronic stage is
implemented explicitly, using its experimentally measured vacuum
cross-sections. In these proceedings we extend our previous work to non-central
collisions, keeping exactly the same methodology and parameters. We find that
our approach leads to a good description of the measured deuteron transverse
momentum spectra at centralities up to 40%, and underestimates the amount of
deuterons at low transverse momentum at higher centralities. Nevertheless, the
coalescence parameter $B_2$, measured by ALICE collaboration, is reproduced
well in our approach even for peripheral collisions.

the ambiguous positive instances are assigned soft labels that are iteratively

researchers because they can solve cold-start problem as well as support for

algorithms specifically addressing a single domain have many difficulties in
capturing the specific characteristics of each domain, multi-domain algorithms
have less opportunity to obtain similar features among domains. Because both
similarities and differences exist among domains, multi-domain models must
capture both to achieve good performance. Other studies of multi-domain systems
merely transfer knowledge from the source domain to the target domain, so the
source domain usually comes from external factors such as the search query or

widely-adopted practice in the literature is to compare the incidence
(events/time) of putative pathological electrophysiological biomarkers
associated with epileptic brain tissue with the SOZ determined from spontaneous
seizures recorded with intracranial EEG, primarily using a single biomarker.
Clinical translation of the previous efforts suffers from their inability to
generalize across multiple patients because of (a) the inter-patient

Here, we report an artificial intelligence-based approach for combining
multiple interictal electrophysiological biomarkers and their temporal
characteristics as a way of accounting for the above barriers and show that it
can reliably identify seizure onset zones in a study cohort of 82 patients who
underwent evaluation for drug-resistant epilepsy. Our investigation provides
evidence that utilizing the complementary information provided by multiple

significantly improve the localization potential compared to previously
published single-biomarker incidence-based approaches, resulting in an average
area under ROC curve (AUC) value of 0.73 in a cohort of 82 patients. Our
results also suggest that recording durations between ninety minutes and two

to physics arose as a byproduct of Bell's seminal work to distinguish, via a
Bell test, quantum correlations from the set of correlations allowed by
local-hidden-variable theories. In practice, since one can only perform a
finite number of experimental trials, deciding whether an empirical observation
is compatible with some class of physical theories will have to be carried out
via the task of hypothesis testing. In this paper, we show that the
prediction-based-ratio method---initially developed for performing a hypothesis
test of local-hidden-variable theories---can equally well be applied to test
many other classes of physical theories, such as those constrained only by the
nonsignaling principle, and those that are constrained to produce any of the
outer approximation to the quantum set of correlations due to
Navascu\'es-Pironio-Ac\'{\i}n. We numerically simulate Bell tests using
hypothetical nonlocal sources of correlations to illustrate the applicability
of the method in both the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)

how this method allows us to unveil an apparent violation of the nonsignaling
conditions in certain experimental data collected in a Bell test. This, in

density of IoT devices. To this end, we propose a sensing-based architecture
that identifies spectral and spatial resources at a fine resolution. In
particular, we first propose a sensing assignment scheduler, where each base
station (BS) is assigned a subset of the spectrum to sense at a high
resolution. We then propose a distributed sensing algorithm, where BSs locally
process and share their sensing reports, so that each BS obtains occupancy
information of the wideband spectrum at its location. Once the spatio-spectral

opportunities while limiting the intra-network and inter-network interference.
Numerical simulations are presented to validate the effectiveness of the
proposed distributed algorithms, comparing them to centralized and

algorithms have complexity and number of function evaluations growing with the
dimension. Motivated by this problem, in this paper, we give a general
algorithm for solving multivariate ordinary differential equations whose

perform complex tasks such as image classification. Rectified Linear Unit
(ReLU) has been widely used and become the default activation function across
the deep learning community since 2012. Although ReLU has been popular,
however, the hard zero property of the ReLU has heavily hindered the negative
values from propagating through the network. Consequently, the deep neural
network has not been benefited from the negative representations. In this work,
an activation function called Flatten-T Swish (FTS) that leverage the benefit
of the negative values is proposed. To verify its performance, this study
evaluates FTS with ReLU and several recent activation functions. Each
activation function is trained using MNIST dataset on five different deep fully
connected neural networks (DFNNs) with depth vary from five to eight layers.
For a fair evaluation, all DFNNs are using the same configuration settings.
Based on the experimental results, FTS with a threshold value, T=-0.20 has the
best overall performance. As compared with ReLU, FTS (T=-0.20) improves MNIST
classification accuracy by 0.13%, 0.70%, 0.67%, 1.07% and 1.15% on wider 5
layers, slimmer 5 layers, 6 layers, 7 layers and 8 layers DFNNs respectively.
Apart from this, the study also noticed that FTS converges twice as fast as
ReLU. Although there are other existing activation functions are also
evaluated, this study elects ReLU as the baseline activation function.

first-order models; one comes from modal logic and universal algebra, another
one from model theory and algebra of ultrafilters, with ultrafilter extensions
of semigroups as its main precursor. By a classical fact of general topology,
the space of ultrafilters over a discrete space is its largest
compactification; the ultrafilter extensions generalize this fact to discrete
spaces endowed with an arbitrary first-order structure. Results of such kind
are referred to as extension theorems.
  We offer a uniform approach to both types of extensions based on the idea to
extend the extension procedure itself. Then we propose a generalization of the
standard concept of first-order interpretations in which functional and
relational symbols are interpreted rather by ultrafilters over sets of
functions and relations than by functions and relations themselves, and define
ultrafilter models with an appropriate semantics for them. We establish
necessary and sufficient conditions under which ultrafilter models coincide
with the canonical ultrafilter extensions of some ordinary models, and obtain
their topological characterization. Further we propose even a wider concept of
ultrafilter models together with their semantics based on limits of
ultrafilters, and show that the new concept absorbs the former one as well as
the ordinary concept of first-order models. We establish necessary and
sufficient conditions under which ultrafilter models in the wide sense coincide
with those in the narrow sense or with the ultrafilter extensions of some
ordinary models. Finally we prove extension theorems for ultrafilter models.

candidates based on an H$\alpha$ emission survey and various published
photometric datasets. Using Gaia DR2 astrometry we studied the spatial
distribution of the young star candidates and isolated three groups based on
their distances. We constructed spectral energy distributions of our target
stars, based on Pan-STARRS, 2MASS, {\it Spitzer} and {\it WISE} photometric
data, estimating their spectral types, extinctions, and luminosities. We
estimated masses by means of pre-main-sequence evolutionary models, and derived
accretion rates from the equivalent width of the H$\alpha$ line. We studied the
structure of the cloud by constructing a new extinction map, based on
Pan-STARRS data. Our results show that the distribution of low-mass young stars
in L1188 is well correlated with that of the dust and mole\-cular gas. We
identified two small, compact clusters and a loose aggregate of young stars. We
found that star formation in L1188 started about 5 million years ago. The

spin-cluster ladders with the plaquette number $n_p$ in each cluster up to six

diagram of such ladders strongly depends on the parity of $n_p$. For even
$n_p$, the phase diagram has two phases, one is the Haldane phase, and the
other is the cluster rung-singlet phase. For odd $n_p$, there are four phases,
which are a cluster-singlet phase, a cluster rung-singlet phase, a Haldane
phase and an even Haldane phase. Moreover, in the latter case the region of the
Haldane phase increases while the cluster-singlet phase and the even Haldane
phase shrink as $n_p$ increases. We thus conjecture that in the large $n_p$
limit, the phase diagram will become independent of $n_p$. By analysing the
ground-state energy and entanglement entropy we obtain the order of the phase
transtions. In particular, for $n_p=1$ there is no phase transition between the
even Haldane phase and the cluster-singlet phase while for other odd $n_p$
there is a first-order phase transition. Our work provides comprehensive phase

material becomes more insulating instead of merely turning into a metal
according to the conventional wisdom. To investigate the underlying mechanisms,
we applied experimental and theoretical methods to examine the electronic and
crystal structures comprehensively, and conclude that the enhanced insulating
state at high pressure originates from the enlarged distortion of the
OsO$_{6}$. It is such a distortion that widens the band gap and decreases the

time by investigating time evolution of mutual information and logarithmic
negativity in two protocols of mass quench. Hamiltonian in both protocols is
for 2-dimensional free scalar theory with time-dependent mass: the mass in one
case decreases monotonically and vanishes asymptotically (ECP), and that in the
other decreases monotonically before t = 0, but increases monotonically
afterward, and becomes constant asymptotically (CCP). We study the time
evolution of the quantum correlations under those protocols in two different
limits of the mass quench; fast limit and slow limit depending on the speed
with which the mass is changed. We obtain the following two results: (1) For
the ECP, we find that the time evolution of logarithmic negativity is, when the
distance between the two subsystems is large enough, well-interpreted in terms
of the propagation of relativistic particles created at a time determined by
the limit of the quench we take. On the other hand, the evolution of mutual
information in the ECP depends not only on the relativistic particles but also
on slowly-moving particles. (2) For the CCP, both logarithmic negativity and
mutual information oscillate in time after the quench. When the subsystems are
well-separated, the oscillation of the quantum correlations in the fast limit
is suppressed, and the time evolution looks similar to that under the ECP in
the fast limit.

matter physics to photonic systems, resulting in fascinating designs of robust
photonic devices. Recently, higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) have
been investigated as a novel topological phase of matter beyond the
conventional bulk-boundary correspondence. Previous studies of HOTIs have been
mainly focused on the topological multipole systems with negative coupling
between lattice sites. Here we experimentally demonstrate that second-order
topological insulating phases without negative coupling can be realized in
two-dimensional dielectric photonic crystals (PCs). We visualize both
one-dimensional topological edge states and zero-dimensional topological corner
states by using near-field scanning technique. To characterize the topological
properties of PCs, we define a novel topological invariant based on the bulk
polarizations. Our findings open new research frontiers for searching HOTIs in
dielectric PCs and provide a new mechanism for light-manipulating in a
hierarchical way.

  Estimation","To appear at CVPR 2019",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Explicit representations of the global match distributions of pixel-wise
correspondences between pairs of images are desirable for uncertainty
estimation and downstream applications. However, the computation of the match
density for each pixel may be prohibitively expensive due to the large number
of candidates. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Discrete Distribution
Decomposition (HD^3), a framework suitable for learning probabilistic pixel
correspondences in both optical flow and stereo matching. We decompose the full
match density into multiple scales hierarchically, and estimate the local
matching distributions at each scale conditioned on the matching and warping at
coarser scales. The local distributions can then be composed together to form
the global match density. Despite its simplicity, our probabilistic method
achieves state-of-the-art results for both optical flow and stereo matching on
established benchmarks. We also find the estimated uncertainty is a good
indication of the reliability of the predicted correspondences.

the proper-time gauge, equivalent to the deformed cubic string field theory,
systematically provides the alpha prime corrections. In addition, we find that

absorption is investigated by integrating the numerical continuum wave
functions. The screened potential is taken to be in Debye-H\H{u}ckel (Yukawa)
form with a screening length D. It is found that the values of the free-free
Gaunt factors for different Debye screening lengths D for a given initial
electron energy \eps_i and absorbing photon energy \omega, generally lie
between those of the pure Coulomb field and field-free case. However, for
initial electron energies below 0.1 Ry and fixed photon energy, the Gaunt
factors show dramatic enhancements (broad and narrow resonances) in the
vicinities of the critical screening lengths, Dnl, at which the energies of nl
bound states in the potential merge into the continuum. These enhancements of
the Gaunt factors can be significantly higher than their values in the
unscreened (Coulomb) case over a broad range of \eps_i. The observed broad and
narrow resonances in the Gaunt factors are related to the temporary formation
of weakly bound (virtual) and resonant (quasi-bound) states of the low-energy
initial electron on the Debye-H\H{u}ckel potential when the screening length is
in the vicinity of Dnl.

ossification of current networks, allowing multiple Virtual Network Requests
(VNRs) embedded on a common infrastructure. The major challenge in network
virtualization is the Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) problem, which is to
embed VNRs onto a shared substrate network and known to be $\mathcal{NP}$-hard.
The topological heterogeneity of VNRs is one important factor hampering the
performance of the VNE. However, in many specialized applications and
infrastructures, VNRs are of some common structural features $\textit{e.g.}$,
paths and cycles. To achieve better outcomes, it is thus critical to design
dedicated algorithms for these applications and infrastructures by taking into
accounting topological characteristics. Besides, paths and cycles are two of
the most fundamental topologies that all network structures consist of.
Exploiting the characteristics of path and cycle embeddings is vital to tackle
the general VNE problem. In this paper, we investigated the path and cycle
embedding problems. For path embedding, we proved its $\mathcal{NP}$-hardness
and inapproximability. Then, by utilizing Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP) and
Multi-Dimensional Knapsack Problem (MDKP), we proposed an efficient and
effective MKP-MDKP-based algorithm. For cycle embedding, we proposed a Weighted
Directed Auxiliary Graph (WDAG) to develop a polynomial-time algorithm to
determine the least-resource-consuming embedding. Numerical results showed our
customized algorithms can boost the acceptance ratio and revenue compared to
generic embedding algorithms in the literature.

  Impact on the Spectrum Usage in Elastic Optical Networks",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Elastic Optical Network (EON) has been considered as a promising optical
networking technology to architect the next-generation backbone networks.
Routing and Spectrum Assignment (RSA) is the fundamental problem in EONs to
realize service provisioning. Generally, the RSA is solved by routing the
requests with lightpaths first and then assigning spectrum resources to the
lightpaths to optimize the spectrum usage. Thus, the spectrum assignment
explicitly decide the final spectrum usage of EONs. However, besides the
spectrum assignment, there are three other factors, the network topology,
traffic distribution and routing scheme, implicitly impact on the spectrum
usage. Few related work involves in the implicit impact mechanism. In this
paper, we aim to provide a thoroughly theoretical analysis on the impact of the
three key factors on the spectrum usage. To this end, two theoretical chains
are proposed: (1) The optimal spectrum usage can be measured by the chromatic
number of the conflict graph, which is positively correlated to the
intersecting probability, \emph{i.e.}, the smaller the intersecting
probability, the smaller the optimal spectrum usage; (2) The intersecting
probability is decided by the network topology, traffic distribution and
routing scheme via a quadratic programming parameterized with a matrix of
conflict coefficients. The effectiveness of our theoretical analysis has been
validated by extensive numerical results. Meanwhile, our theoretical deductions
also permit to give several constant approximation ratios for RSA algorithms.

forcing scale have been conjectured to reach a thermal equilibrium state
forming a $k^2$ energy spectrum. In this work we examine the properties of
these large scales in turbulent flows with the use of numerical simulations. We
show that the choice of forcing can strongly affect the behavior of the large
scales. A spectrally-dense forcing (a forcing that acts on {\it all modes}
inside a finite-width spherical shell) with long correlation times may lead to
strong deviations from the $k^2$ energy spectrum, while a spectrally-sparse
forcing (a forcing that acts only on a few modes) with short correlated
time-scale can reproduce the thermal spectrum. It is shown that the
spectrally-dense forcing allows for numerous triadic interactions that couple
one large scale mode with two forced modes and this leads to an excess of
energy input in the large scales. This excess of energy is then moved back to
the small-scales by self-interactions of the large-scale modes and by
interactions with the turbulent small-scales. The overall picture that arises
from the present analysis is that the large scales in a turbulent flow resemble
a reservoir that is in (non-local) contact with a second out-of equilibrium
reservoir consisting of the smaller (forced and turbulent) scales. If the
injection of energy at the large scales from the forced modes is relative weak
then the large-scale spectrum remains close to a thermal equilibrium and the
role of long-range interactions is to set the global energy (temperature) of
the equilibrium state. If, on the other hand, the long-range interactions are
dominant, the large-scale self-interactions cannot respond fast enough to bring
the system into equilibrium. Then the large scales deviate from the equilibrium
state with energy spectrum that may display exponents different from the $k^2$
spectrum.

pancake-shaped trap, modeled by an effective two-dimensional coupled
Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The anisotropy of the dipolar interactions, on
miscibility and vortex-lattice structures, is studied by tuning the
polarization angle of the dipoles $\varphi$, which can enhance the attractive
part of the dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) for both inter- and intra-species.
Within this procedure of changing to attractive the DDI, a clear spatial
separation is verified in the densities at some critical polarization angle.
The spatial separations, being angular for symmetric mixtures and radial for
asymmetric ones, are verified for repulsive contact interactions when the
inter- to intra-species ratio $\delta$ is larger than one, implying the system
is less miscible. The corresponding result for the critical polarization angle
as a function of $\delta$ is shown in the particular dipolar symmetric case. A
striking outcome of the present study is the observed sensibility of the
vortex-pattern binary distributions due to the mass-asymmetry. This is
exemplified by the symmetric dipolar mixture, where the two isotopes are of the

multi-task learning to optimization to study how to effectively and efficiently

multi-tasking, or multi-factorial optimization, is an emerging subfield of
multi-task optimization, which integrates evolutionary computation and
multi-task learning. This paper proposes a novel and easy-to-implement
multi-tasking genetic algorithm (MTGA), which copes well with significantly
different optimization tasks by estimating and using the bias among them.
Comparative studies with eight state-of-the-art single- and multi-task
approaches in the literature on nine benchmarks demonstrated that on average
the MTGA outperformed all of them, and had lower computational cost than six of
them. Based on the MTGA, a simultaneous optimization strategy for fuzzy system
design is also proposed. Experiments on simultaneous optimization of type-1 and
interval type-2 fuzzy logic controllers for couple-tank water level control
demonstrated that the MTGA can find better fuzzy logic controllers than other

the other party obtains the random bits $a,b$. Based on $EG[P^x](x\in\{0,1\})$,
we propose a method to remove the $P$-error generated in the homomorphic
evaluation of $T/T^\dagger$-gate. Using this method, we design two
non-interactive and perfectly secure QHE schemes named \texttt{GT} and
\texttt{VGT}. Both of them are $\mathcal{F}$-homomorphic and quasi-compact (the
decryption complexity depends on the $T/T^\dagger$-gate complexity).
  Assume $\mathcal{F}$-homomorphism, non-interaction and perfect security are
necessary property, the quasi-compactness is proved to be bounded by $O(M)$,

\texttt{VGT} is proved to be optimal and has $M$-quasi-compactness. According
to our QHE schemes, the decryption would be inefficient if the evaluated
circuit contains exponential number of $T/T^\dagger$-gates. Thus our schemes
are suitable for homomorphic evaluation of any quantum circuit with low

In results, selecting training instances of multiple languages can deliver

beamforming optimization, the problem is a well-known non-convex quadratically
constrained quadratic program (QCQP) that is NP-hard to solve. After
semi-definite relaxation (SDR), the problem can be optimally solved via
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for distributed
implementation. Analytical and extensive numerical analyses demonstrate that
the proposed ADMM solution converges to the optimal centralized solution. The
convergence rate, computational complexity, and message exchange load of the
proposed algorithm outperforms the existing solutions. Furthermore, by SINR
approximation at the relay side, distributed joint transmit and relay
beamforming optimization is also proposed that further improves the total power
saving at the cost of increased complexity.

(SLS) solver to explore solutions to the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT).
AmbSAT updates multiple variables in parallel at every iteration step, and thus
AmbSAT can find solutions with a fewer number of iteration steps than some
other conventional SLS solvers for a specific set of SAT instances. However,
the parallelism of AmbSAT is not compatible with general-purpose
microprocessors in that many clock cycles are required to execute each
iteration; thus, AmbSAT requires special hardware that can exploit the
parallelism of AmbSAT to quickly find solutions. In this paper, we propose a
circuit model (hardware-friendly algorithm) that explores solutions to SAT in a
similar way to AmbSAT, which we call circuit-level AmbSAT (CL-AmbSAT). We
conducted numerical simulation to evaluate the search performance of CL-AmbSAT
for a set of randomly generated SAT instances that was designed to estimate the
scalability of our approach. Simulation results showed that CL-AmbSAT finds
solutions with a fewer iteration number than a powerful SLS solver, ProbSAT,
and outperforms even AmbSAT. Since CL-AmbSAT uses simple combinational logic to
update variables, CL-AmbSAT can be easily implemented in various hardware.

to be effective in some cases. The main weaknesses of these approaches are that
they never exploit code dependencies and summarize either the software classes
or methods but not both. This paper proposes a source code summarization
approach (Suncode) that produces a short description for each class and method
in the software system. To validate the approach, it has been applied to
several case studies. Moreover, the generated summaries are compared to
summaries that written by human experts and to summaries that written by a
state-of-the-art solution. Results of this paper found that Suncode summaries
provide better information about code dependencies comparing with other
studies. In addition, Suncode summaries can improve and support the current
software documentation. The results found that manually written summaries were
more precise and short as well.

intelligence algorithms to the edge computing devices. CNNs form a large part
of these AI algorithms. Systolic array based CNN acceleration is being widely
advocated due its ability to allow scalable architectures. However, CNNs are
inherently memory and compute intensive algorithms, and hence pose significant
challenges to be implemented on the resource-constrained edge computing
devices. Memory-constrained low-cost FPGA based devices form a substantial
fraction of these edge computing devices. Thus, when porting to such
edge-computing devices, the designer is left unguided as to how to select a
suitable systolic array configuration that could fit in the available hardware
resources. In this paper we propose Systimator, a design space exploration
based methodology that provides a set of design points that can be mapped
within the memory bounds of the target FPGA device. The methodology is based
upon an analytical model that is formulated to estimate the required resources
for systolic arrays, assuming multiple data reuse patterns. The methodology
further provides the performance estimates for each of the candidate design
points. We show that Systimator provides an in-depth analysis of
resource-requirement of systolic array based CNNs. We provide our resource
estimation results for porting of convolutional layers of TINY YOLO, a CNN
based object detector, on a Xilinx ARTIX 7 FPGA.
