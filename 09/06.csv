Recently, neural-network-based approaches have outperformed well-established
models in this task. However, in languages other than English, there has been
little exploration in this direction. Both the scarcity of annotated data and
the complexity of the language increase the difficulty of the problem. To
address these challenges, we use a sequence-to-sequence model with
character-based attention, which in addition to its self-learned character
embeddings, uses word embeddings pre-trained with an approach that also models
subword information. This provides the neural model with access to more
linguistic information especially suitable for text normalization, without
large parallel corpora. We show that providing the model with word-level
features bridges the gap for the neural network approach to achieve a
state-of-the-art F1 score on a standard Arabic language correction shared task

innovations in different scenarios. However, many vital issues which affect its
performance are still open. For example, it is widely convinced that high level
of security and scalability and full decentralization are still impossible to
achieve simultaneously. In this paper, we propose Bicomp, a bilayer scalable
Nakamoto consensus protocol, which is an approach based on high security and
pure decentralized Nakamoto consensus, and with a significant improvement on
scalability. In Bicomp, two kinds of blocks are generated, i.e., microblocks
for concurrent transaction packaging in network, and macroblocks for leadership
competition and chain formation. A leader is elected at beginning of each round
by using a macroblock header from proof-of-work. An elected leader then
receives and packages multiple microblocks mined by different nodes into one
macroblock during its tenure, which results in a bilayer block structure. Such
design limits a leader's power and encourages as many nodes as possible to
participate in the process of packaging transactions, which promotes the
sharding nature of the system. Furthermore, several mechanisms are carefully
designed to reduce transaction overlapping and further limit a leader's power,
among which a novel transaction diversity based metric is proposed as the
second level criteria besides the longest-chain-first principle on selecting a
legitimate chain when fork happens. Security issues and potential attacks to
Bicomp are extensively discussed and experiments for evaluation are performed.
From the experimental results based on 50 nodes all over the world, Bicomp
achieves significant improvement on scalability than that of Bitcoin and
Ethereum, while the security and decentralization merits are still preserved.

this distance, the system N36 is found to be situated at the interface of the

Using the GRS 13CO line data, in the direction of the system N36, two velocity

violation of the Jarzynski equality. The divide between the two regimes,
satisfaction of Jarzynski with ther- molubricity, and violation of both, simply
coincides with the total frictional work per cycle falling below or above kT
respectively. This concept can, with due caution, be extended to more complex
sliders, thus inviting crosscheck experiments, such as searching for free
lunches in cold ion sliding as well as in forced protein unwinding, and
alternatively checking for a thermolubric regime in dragged colloid monolayers.
As an important byproduct, we derive a parameter-free formula expressing the
linear velocity coefficient of frictional dissipated power in the thermolubric
viscous regime, correcting previous empirically parametrized expressions.

This has created a need for large annotated datasets. The source of big data is

detection of disease requires a training dataset with markings of the areas of
interest on the image that match with the described anomalies. This process of
annotation is expensive and needs the involvement of clinicians. In this work
we propose two separate deep neural network architectures for automatic marking
of a region of interest (ROI) on the image best representing a finding
location, given a textual report or a set of keywords. One architecture
consists of LSTM and CNN components and is trained end to end with images,
matching text, and markings of ROIs for those images. The output layer
estimates the coordinates of the vertices of a polygonal region. The second
architecture uses a network pre-trained on a large dataset of the same image
types for learning feature representations of the findings of interest. We show
that for a variety of findings from chest X-ray images, both proposed
architectures learn to estimate the ROI, as validated by clinical annotations.
There is a clear advantage obtained from the architecture with pre-trained
imaging network. The centroids of the ROIs marked by this network were on
average at a distance equivalent to 5.1% of the image width from the centroids
of the ground truth ROIs.

cavity and (2) a mechanism for directional emission. Previous theoretical and
experimental work demonstrated that the two requirements can be met with
deformed dielectric cavities that generate chaotic ray dynamics. Is it possible
for a massless Dirac spinor wave in graphene or its photonic counterpart to
exhibit a similar behavior? Intuitively, because of the absence of
backscattering of associated massless spin-1/2 particles and Klein tunneling,
confining the wave in a cavity for a long time seems not feasible. Deforming
the cavity to generate classical chaos would make confinement even more
difficult. Investigating the decay of a spin-1/2 wave from a scalar potential
barrier defined cavity characterized by an effective refractive index $n$ that
depends on the applied potential and the particle energy, we uncover the
striking existence of an interval of the refractive index in which the average
lifetime of the massless spin-1/2 wave in the cavity can be as high as that of
the electromagnetic wave, for both integrable and chaotic cavities. We also
find scaling laws for the ratio between the mean escape time associated with
electromagnetic waves and that with massless spin-1/2 particles versus the
index outside of this interval. The scaling laws hold regardless of the nature
of the classical dynamics. All the results are verified numerically. The
findings provide insights into the emergent field of Dirac electron optics and
have potential applications in developing unconventional electronics using 2D

the most competent classifier in a pool, even when its presence is assured.
Since the DCS techniques rely only on local data to estimate a classifier's
competence, the manner in which the pool is generated could affect the choice
of the best classifier for a given sample. That is, the global perspective in
which pools are generated may not help the DCS techniques in selecting a
competent classifier for samples that are likely to be mislabelled. Thus, we
propose in this work an online pool generation method that produces a locally
accurate pool for test samples in difficult regions of the feature space. The
difficulty of a given area is determined by the classification difficulty of
the samples in it. That way, by using classifiers that were generated in a
local scope, it could be easier for the DCS techniques to select the best one
for the difficult samples. For the query samples in easy regions, a simple
nearest neighbors rule is used. In the extended version of this work, a deep
analysis on the correlation between instance hardness and the performance of
DCS techniques is presented. An instance hardness measure that conveys the
degree of local class overlap is then used to decide when the local pool is
used in the proposed scheme. The proposed method yielded significantly greater
recognition rates in comparison to a Bagging-generated pool and two other
global pool generation schemes for all DCS techniques evaluated. The proposed
scheme's performance was also significantly superior to three state-of-the-art
classification models and statistically equivalent to five of them. Moreover,
an extended analysis on the computational complexity of the proposed method and
of several DS techniques is presented in this version. We also provide the

sensitive to the boundary conditions of the wire. Here, we analyze the

Strikingly, with increasing many-body interactions in the wire, the impact of
the boundary noise becomes more prominent. This interplay allows for a smooth
crossover from standard 1D tunneling signatures into a regime where the
tunneling is dominated by the fluctuations at the leads. This regime is
characterized by elevated zero-bias tunneling alongside a universal power-law
decay at high energies. Furthermore, local tunneling measurements in this

standing waves in the wire. Our result offers a tunable method by which to
control the boundary effects and measure the interaction strength (Luttinger

offer a typical example where the weakness of magnetic interactions hampers our
ability to control the strength of their chiral optical response. It is limited
several orders of magnitude below the full potential. Here we introduce freely

chiral quantum systems extremely efficiently. To demonstrate the degree of
control enabled by such fields, we focus on the nonlinear optical response of
randomly oriented chiral molecules. We show full control over intensity,
polarization and propagation direction of the chiral optical response, enabling
its background-free detection. This response can be fully suppressed or
enhanced at will depending on the molecular handedness, achieving the ultimate
limit in chiral discrimination. Our findings open a way to extremely efficient
control of chiral matter and to ultrafast imaging of chiral structure and

crystalline insulator (TCI) protected by rotation symmetry. The model is built
by stacking two Chern insulators with opposite Chern numbers which transform
under conjugate representations of the rotation group, e.g. $p_\pm$ orbitals.
Despite its apparent similarity to the Kane-Mele model, it does not host stable
gapless surface states. Nevertheless the model exhibits topological responses
including the appearance of quantized fractional charge bound to rotational
defects (disclinations) and the pumping of angular momentum in response to
threading an elementary magnetic flux, which are described by a mutual
Chern-Simons coupling between the electromagnetic gauge field and an effective
gauge field corresponding to the rotation symmetry. In addition, we show that
although the filled bands of the model do not admit a symmetric Wannier
representation, this obstruction is removed upon the addition of appropriate
atomic orbitals, which implies `fragile' topology. As a result, the response of
the model can be derived by representing it as a superposition of atomic
orbitals with positive and negative integer coefficients. Following the
analysis of the model, which serves as a prototypical example of 2D TCIs
protected by rotation, we show that all TCIs protected by point group
symmetries which do not have protected surface states are either atomic
insulators or fragile phases. Remarkably, this implies that gapless surface
states exist in free electron systems if and only if there is a stable Wannier
obstruction. We then use dimensional reduction to map the problem of
classifying 2D TCIs protected by rotation to a zero-dimensional (0D) problem
which is then used to obtain the complete non-interacting classification of
such TCIs as well as the reduction of this classification in the presence of

implying efficient removal of refractory carbon before parent body formation.
It has been argued that grains get rid of their carbon through oxidation and
photolysis in the exposed upper disk layers. We assess the efficacy of these
C-removal mechanisms accounting for the vertical and radial transport of
grains. We obtain the carbon and carbon free mass budget of solids by solving
two 1D advection-diffusion equations, accounting for the dust grain size
distribution and radial transport. The carbon removal acts on the fraction of
the grains that are in the exposed layer and requires efficient vertical
transport. In models without radial transport, oxidation and photolysis can
destroy most of the refractory carbon in terrestrial planet formation region.
But it only reaches the observed depletion levels for extreme parameter
combinations and requires that parent body formation was delayed by 1 Myr.
Adding radial transport of solids prevents the depletion entirely, leaving
refractory carbon equally distributed throughout the disk. It is unlikely that
the observed carbon depletion can ultimately be attributed to mechanisms
operating on small grains in the disk surface layers. Other mechanisms need to
be studied, for example flash heating events or FU Ori outbursts in order to
remove carbon quickly and deeply. However, a sustained drift barrier or
strongly reduced radial grain mobility are necessary to prevent replenishment
of carbon from the outer disk.

into two steps. The first step involves computing the Coulomb branch data of
the 5d KK theory obtained by compactifying a 6d SCFT on a circle of finite
radius. The second step involves computing the limit of the KK theory when the
inverse radius along with some other mass parameters is sent to infinity. Under
this RG flow, the KK theory reduces to a 5d SCFT. We illustrate these ideas in
the case of untwisted compactifications of rank one 6d SCFTs that can be
constructed in F-theory without frozen singularities. The data of the
corresponding KK theory can be packaged in the geometry of a Calabi-Yau
threefold that we explicitly compute for every case. The RG flows correspond to
flopping a collection of curves in the threefold and we formulate a concrete
set of criteria which can be used to determine which collection of curves can
induce the relevant RG flows, and, in principle, to determine the Calabi-Yau
geometries describing the endpoints of these flows. We also comment on how to
generalize our results to arbitrary rank.

charge, polarization current and background polarization and magnetization
satisfying the charge-current continuity equation. This representation is of
similar form to photon sector odd-parity Lorentz invariance violating
background fields. We show that when a DC B-field is applied an oscillating
background polarization is induced at a frequency equivalent to the axion mass.
In contrast, when DC E-field is applied, an oscillating background
magnetization is induced at a frequency equivalent to the axion mass. We show
that these terms are equivalent to impressed source terms, analogous to the way
that voltage and current sources are impressed into Maxwell's equations in
circuit and antenna theory. The impressed source terms represent the conversion
of external energy into electromagnetic energy, and in the case of axion
modified electrodynamics this is due to the inverse Primakoff effect converting
energy from axions into photons. The axion induced oscillating polarization
under a DC magnetic field is analogous to a permanent polarised electret
oscillating at the axion Compton frequency, which sources an electromotive
force from an effective impressed magnetic current source. In particular, it is
shown that the impressed electrical DC current that drives the solenoidal
magnetic DC field of an electromagnet, induces an impressed magnetic current
parallel to the DC electrical current, oscillating at the Compton frequency of
the axion. We show that the magnetic current drives a voltage source through an
electric vector potential and also defines the boundary condition of the
oscillating axion induced polarization inside and outside the electromagnet.

should not only comprise customized solutions for one particular survey or

also be capable of dealing with spectra from a variety of spectrographs,
resolutions, and wavelength coverages. To meet these ambitious specifications,
we developed ATHOS (A Tool for HOmogenizing Stellar parameters), a
fundamentally new analysis tool that adopts computationally inexpensive
analytical relations tying flux ratios (FRs) of designated wavelength regions
in optical spectra to the stellar parameters effective temperature
($T_\mathrm{eff}$), iron abundance ([Fe/H]), and surface gravity ($\log{g}$).
Our $T_\mathrm{eff}$ estimator is based on FRs from nine pairs of wavelength
ranges around the Balmer lines H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$, while for [Fe/H] and
$\log{g}$ we provide 31 and 11 FRs between 4800 {\AA} and 6500 \AA. The
analytical relations employing these FRs were trained on 124 real spectra of a
benchmark sample that covers a large parameter space of $T_{\rm eff}\approx$
4000 to 6500 K, [Fe/H] $\approx$ -4.5 to 0.3 dex, and $\log{g}\approx$ 1 to 5
dex, which also reflects ATHOS' range of applicability. The method's accuracies
are merely bounded by finite uncertainties in the training sample parameters,
while its internal precisions can be better by up to 70%. We tested ATHOS on
six independent large surveys, amongst which are the Gaia-ESO and the
SDSS/SEGUE surveys. The exceptionally low execution time (<30 ms/spectrum)
together with a comparison to the literature parameters showed that ATHOS can
successfully achieve its main objectives, i.e. fast stellar parameterization
with cross-survey validity, high accuracy, and high precision. These are key to
homogenize the output from future surveys, such as 4MOST or WEAVE. [abridged]

observe topological phenomena at single quantum particle level, which, however,

SFS, our GMM method also identifies sub-components in the star formation

quiescent sub-populations. The hydrodynamic simulations are similarly dominated
by SFS and quiescent sub-populations unlike the SC-SAM, which predicts
substantial fractions of transitioning and star-burst galaxies at stellar

Hence, the BPS property in 1+1 dimensions can be extended not only to an
arbitrary number of scalar fields and k-deformed models, but also to any (well
behaved) higher derivative theory. We also investigate the possibility to
destroy the BPS property by adding an impurity which breaks the translational
symmetry. Further, we find that there is a particular impurity-field coupling
which still preserves {\it one-half} of the BPS-ness. An example of such a BPS
kink-impurity bound state is provided.

critical magnetic Reynolds number is lower than when both the solenoidal and

cluster outskirts, where galaxies have not spent enough time to feel the
cluster environmental effect, hints for the presence of pre-processing. Using
cosmological hydrodynamic simulations on 16 clusters, we investigate the
mechanisms of gas depletion of galaxies found inside clusters. The gas
depletion mechanisms can be categorized into three channels based on where and
when they took place. First, 34$\%$ of our galaxies are gas poor before
entering clusters (`pre-processing'). They are mainly satellites that have
undergone the environmental effect inside group halos. Second, 43$\%$ of the
sample became quickly gas deficient in clusters before the first pericentric
pass (`fast cluster processing'). Some of them were group satellites that are
low in gas at the time of cluster entry compared to the galaxies directly
coming from the field. Even the galaxies with large gas fractions take this
channel if they fall into massive clusters ($> 10^{14.5}\, \rm M_{\odot}$) or
approach cluster centers through radial orbits. Third, 24$\%$ of our sample
retain gas even after their first pericentric pass (`slow cluster processing')
as they fall into the less massive clusters and/or have circular orbits. The
relative importance of each channel varies with a cluster's mass, while the
exact degree of significance is subject to large uncertainties. Group
pre-processing accounts for a third of the total gas depletion; but it also
determines the gas fraction of galaxies at their cluster entry which in turn
determines whether a galaxy should take the fast or the slow cluster
processing.

for arbitrary subsystems of a densely represented state, as well as block
subsystems of matrix product states. The method combines lazily evaluated,
tensor network representations of the partially transposed density matrix with
stochastic Lanczos quadrature, and is easily extendible to other quantities and
classes of many-body states. As examples, we compute the entanglement within
random pure states for density matrices of up to 30 qubits, explore scrambling
in a many-body quench, and match the results of conformal field theory in the
ground-state of the Heisenberg model for density matrices of up to 1000 spins.
An implementation of the algorithm has been made available in the open-source
library \textit{quimb}.

radiologists must carry out frequently. Therefore, image analysis methods are
needed for the detection and delineation of breast masses, which portray
crucial morphological information that will support reliable diagnosis. In this
paper, we proposed a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) devised
to segment a breast mass within a region of interest (ROI) in a mammogram. The
generative network learns to recognize the breast mass area and to create the
binary mask that outlines the breast mass. In turn, the adversarial network
learns to distinguish between real (ground truth) and synthetic segmentations,
thus enforcing the generative network to create binary masks as realistic as
possible. The cGAN works well even when the number of training samples are
limited. Therefore, the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art
approaches. This hypothesis is corroborated by diverse experiments performed on
two datasets, the public INbreast and a private in-house dataset. The proposed
segmentation model provides a high Dice coefficient and Intersection over Union
(IoU) of 94% and 87%, respectively. In addition, a shape descriptor based on a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is proposed to classify the generated masks
into four mass shapes: irregular, lobular, oval and round. The proposed shape
descriptor was trained on Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM)
yielding an overall accuracy of 80%, which outperforms the current
state-of-the-art.

  The underlying models were trained using convolutional neural networks and
deep learning techniques, which provide better results than methods based on
manual feature engineering and SVMs in most of the cases where training

end-to-end using public datasets such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS),
the Galaxy Zoo, and private datasets such as the Next Generation Virgo (NGVS)

augmentation for the training using 5 conversion methods. This greatly improves

observations show that solar wind minor ions and ion sub-populations flow with
different bulk velocities. Measurements indicate that the drift speed of both
alpha particles and proton beams with respect to the bulk or core protons
rarely exceeds the local Alfv\'en speed, suggesting that a magnetic instability
or other wave-particle process limits their maximum drift. We compare
simultaneous alpha particle, proton beam, and proton core observations from
instruments on the Wind spacecraft spanning over 20 years. In nearly
collisionless solar wind, we find that the normalized alpha particle drift
speed is slower than the normalized proton beam speed; no correlation between
fluctuations in both species' drifts about their means; and a strong
anti-correlation between collisional age and alpha-proton differential flow,
but no such correlation with proton beam-core differential flow. Controlling
for the collisional dependence, both species' normalized drifts exhibit similar
statistical distributions. In the asymptotic, zero Coulomb collision limit, the
youngest measured differential flows most strongly correlate with an
approximation of the Alfv\'en speed that includes proton pressure anisotropy.
In this limit and with this most precise representation, alpha particles drift
at 67% and proton beam drift is approximately 105% of the local Alfv\'en speed.
We posit that one of two physical explanations is possible. Either (1) an
Alfv\'enic process preferentially accelerates or sustains proton beams and not
alphas or (2) alpha particles are more susceptible to either an instability or
Coulomb drag than proton beams.

object detection in recent years due to the rise of deep neural networks, the
state-of-the-art algorithms are highly computationally intensive. In order to
address this challenge, we make two important observations in the context of
videos: (i) Objects often occupy only a small fraction of the area in each
video frame, and (ii) There is a high likelihood of strong temporal correlation
between consecutive frames. Based on these observations, we propose Pack and
Detect (PaD), an approach to reduce the computational requirements of object
detection in videos. In PaD, only selected video frames called anchor frames
are processed at full size. In the frames that lie between anchor frames
(inter-anchor frames), regions of interest (ROIs) are identified based on the
detections in the previous frame. We propose an algorithm to pack the ROIs of
each inter-anchor frame together into a reduced-size frame. The computational
requirements of the detector are reduced due to the lower size of the input. In
order to maintain the accuracy of object detection, the proposed algorithm
expands the ROIs greedily to provide additional background around each object
to the detector. PaD can use any underlying neural network architecture to
process the full-size and reduced-size frames. Experiments using the ImageNet
video object detection dataset indicate that PaD can potentially reduce the
number of FLOPS required for a frame by $4\times$. This leads to an overall
increase in throughput of $1.25\times$ on a 2.1 GHz Intel Xeon server with a

clusters, a set of high resolution simulations with resolved galaxies a median
total mass, $M_{200c} = 10^{14.7} \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$. We quantify the bias
and scatter of the Jeans, virial, and caustic mass estimators using all
galaxies with a stellar mass $M_*> 10^9 \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$, both in the ideal
3D case and in the more realistic projected case. On average we find our mass
estimates are unbiased, though relative to the true mass within $r_{200c}$ the
scatter is large with a range of $0.09$ - $0.15$ dex. We see a slight increase
in the scatter when projecting the clusters. Selecting galaxies using the same
criteria, we find no significant difference in the mass bias or scatter when
comparing results from hydrodynamical and dark matter only simulations.
However, selecting galaxies by stellar mass reduces the bias compared to
selecting by total mass. Comparing X-ray derived hydrostatic and dynamical
masses, the former are ${\sim} 30$ per cent lower. We find a slight dependence
between substructure, measured using two different metrics, and mass bias. In
conclusion, we find that dynamical mass estimators, when averaged together, are

quantitative statistical analysis of the spatial and temporal behavior of cells

is a prerequisite for the construction of hypothesis-driven mathematical models
that can provide mechanistic explanations by generating spatiotemporal dynamics
that can be directly compared to experimental observations. Here, we provide a
brief overview of statistical methods in analyzing spatial distribution of
cells, cell motility, cell shapes and cellular genealogies. We also describe
cell- based modeling formalisms that allow researchers to simulate emergent

among ten old globular clusters (GCs) of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Such
spreads are merely observed in approximately five per cent of the Milky Way GCs

derived metallicities with a typical precision of 0.05 dex < sigma[Fe/H] < 0.20
dex for an average of 14 red giant branch stars per GC from Str\""omgren
photometry. The respective, metallicity-sensitive indices have been calibrated
to precise and accurate high-dispersion spectroscopy. For all clusters we found
null [Fe/H] spreads with a typical uncertainty of 0.04 dex, with the possible
exception of NGC1786 that shows an intrinsic dispersion of 0.07+-0.04 dex. The
mean, observed standard deviation of the derived metallicities for nearly 40

cannot exclude that the remaining GCs also have intrinsic Fe-abundance
variations in excess of 0.05 dex, but in order to significantly detect those,
the measurement errors on individual [Fe/H]-values would need to be lowered to
the 0.03--0.07 dex level. These findings suggest, along with those from ages

the homogeneous case in which it takes the same amount of time to serve each

involves two subproblems: (i) finding the best time to wake up the system and
(ii) finding the best time to let the system go to sleep. We study the two

to the achieved performance in many machine learning and computer vision tasks.
However, most of the deep learning architectures are vulnerable to so called

for many security- and trust-sensitive domains. The majority of the proposed
existing adversarial attacks are based on the differentiability of the DNN cost
function.Defence strategies are mostly based on machine learning and signal
processing principles that either try to detect-reject or filter out the
adversarial perturbations and completely neglect the classical cryptographic
component in the defence. In this work, we propose a new defence mechanism
based on the second Kerckhoffs's cryptographic principle which states that the
defence and classification algorithm are supposed to be known, but not the key.
To be compliant with the assumption that the attacker does not have access to
the secret key, we will primarily focus on a gray-box scenario and do not
address a white-box one. More particularly, we assume that the attacker does
not have direct access to the secret block, but (a) he completely knows the
system architecture, (b) he has access to the data used for training and
testing and (c) he can observe the output of the classifier for each given
input. We show empirically that our system is efficient against most famous

equilibria of games with smooth payoff functions are generally
Pareto-inefficient \cite{Dubey} In the spirit of Von Neumann's Minimax Theorem
and its polynomial-time solvability via Linear Programming, Kalantari
\cite{Kalantari} has described a multilinear minimax relaxation (MMR) that
provides an approximation to a convex combination of expected payoffs in any
Nash Equilibrium via LP. In this paper, we study this relaxation for the
bimatrix game, solving its corresponding LP formulation and comparing its
solution to the solution computed by the Lemke-Howson algorithm. We also give a
game theoretic interpretation of MMR for the bimatrix game involving a
meta-player. Our relaxation has the following theoretical advantages: (1) It
can be computed in polynomial time; (2) For at least one player, the computed
MMR payoff is at least as good any Nash Equilibrium payoff; (3) There exists a
convex scaling of the payoff matrices giving equal payoffs. Such a solution is
a satisfactory compromise. Computationally, we have compared our approach with
the state-of-the-art implementation of the Lemke-Howson algorithm \cite{Lemke}.
We have observed the following advantages: (i) MMR outperformed Lemke-Howson in
time complexity; (ii) In about $80\%$ of the cases the MMR payoffs for both
players are better than any Nash Equilibria; (iii) in the remaining $20\%$,
while one player's payoff is better than any Nash Equilibrium payoff, the other
player's payoff is only within a relative error of $17\%$.

spectrum of solar-like oscillation modes. Observations by CoRoT and Kepler have
shown that the mode amplitudes increase dramatically as the stars ascend the
red giant branch, i.e., as the frequency of maximum power, $\nu_\mathrm{max}$,
decreases. Most studies nonetheless assume that the modes are well described by
the linearized fluid equations. We investigate to what extent the linear
approximation is justified as a function of stellar mass $M$ and
$\nu_\mathrm{max}$, focusing on dipole mixed modes with frequency near
$\nu_\mathrm{max}$. A useful measure of a mode's nonlinearity is the product of
its radial wavenumber and its radial displacement, $k_r \xi_r$ (i.e., its
shear). We show that $k_r \xi_r \propto \nu_\mathrm{max}^{-9/2}$, implying that
the nonlinearity of mixed modes increases significantly as a star evolves. The
modes are weakly nonlinear ($k_r \xi_r > 10^{-3}$) for $\nu_\mathrm{max}
\lesssim 150 \, \mu\mathrm{Hz}$ and strongly nonlinear ($k_r \xi_r > 1$) for
$\nu_\mathrm{max} \lesssim 30 \, \mu\mathrm{Hz}$, with only a mild dependence
on $M$ over the range we consider ($1.0 - 2.0 M_\odot$). A weakly nonlinear
mixed mode can excite secondary waves in the stellar core through the
parametric instability, resulting in enhanced, but partial, damping of the
mode. By contrast, a strongly nonlinear mode breaks as it propagates through
the core and is fully damped there. Evaluating the impact of nonlinear effects
on observables such as mode amplitudes and linewidths requires large mode
network simulations. We plan to carry out such calculations in the future and
investigate whether nonlinear damping can explain why some red giants exhibit
dipole modes with unusually small amplitudes, known as depressed modes.

patterns, complementing acoustic speech to improve the overall recognition
performance, particularly in noise. In this paper we propose an audio-visual
fusion strategy that goes beyond simple feature concatenation and learns to
automatically align the two modalities, leading to enhanced representations
which increase the recognition accuracy in both clean and noisy conditions. We
test our strategy on the TCD-TIMIT and LRS2 datasets, designed for large
vocabulary continuous speech recognition, applying three types of noise at
different power ratios. We also exploit state of the art Sequence-to-Sequence
architectures, showing that our method can be easily integrated. Results show
relative improvements from 7% up to 30% on TCD-TIMIT over the acoustic modality
alone, depending on the acoustic noise level. We anticipate that the fusion
strategy can easily generalise to many other multimodal tasks which involve
correlated modalities. Code available online on GitHub:

However, stability and scattering to the transport problem fail in $H^{s},
s>-1$. We further show that this behavior is consistent with the nonlinear
Euler equations and that a similar result also holds for the nonlinear
Navier-Stokes equations. Hence, these results provide an indication that
nonlinear inviscid damping may still hold in Sobolev regularity in the above

secular De Sitter precession of $-7.6$ milliarcseconds per year for a suitable
choice of the initial value of its non-circulating node $\Omega$. The competing
long-periodic harmonic rates of change of $I$ due to the even and odd zonal
harmonics of the geopotential vanish for either a circular or polar orbit,
while no secular rates occur at all. This may open up, in principle, the
possibility of measuring the geodesic precession in the weak-field limit with
an accurately tracked satellite by improving the current bound of $9\times
10^{-4}$ from Lunar Laser Ranging, which, on the other hand, may be even rather
optimistic, by one order of magnitude, or, perhaps, even better. The most
insidious competing effects are due to the solid and ocean components of the
$K_1$ tide since their perturbations have nominal huge amplitudes and the same
temporal pattern of the De Sitter signature. They vanish for polar orbits.
Departures of $\simeq 10^{-5}-10^{-3}~\textrm{deg}$ from the ideal polar
geometry allow to keep the $K_1$ tidal perturbations to a sufficiently small
level. Most of the other gravitational and non-gravitational perturbations
vanish for the proposed orbital configuration, while the non-vanishing ones
either have different temporal signatures with respect to the De Sitter effect
or can be modeled with sufficient accuracy. In order to meet the proposed goal,
the measurement accuracy of $I$ should be better than $\simeq
35~\textrm{microarcseconds}=0.034~\textrm{milliarcseconds}$ over, say, 5 yr.

small size or reactive nodes. Radiomics and deep learning are the two preferred

built based on handcrafted features, and deep learning can learn the features
automatically. We proposed a hybrid predictive model that combines
many-objective radiomics (MO-radiomics) and 3-dimensional convolutional neural

designed a 3D-CNN that fully utilizes spatial contextual information. Finally,
the outputs were fused through the ER approach. To study the predictability of
the two modalities, three models were built for PET, CT, and PET&CT. The
results showed that the model performed best when the two modalities were
combined. Moreover, we showed that the quantitative results obtained from the

side information needs to evolve with $n$ in terms of either its quantity, or

obtained for weak recovery. Under belief propagation, tight necessary and
sufficient conditions for weak recovery are calculated when the LLRs are

service time distribution and a single dispatcher where tasks arrive as a
Poisson process of rate $\lambda(N)$. When a task arrives, the dispatcher
assigns it to one of the servers according to the Join-the-Shortest Queue (JSQ)
policy. Eschenfeldt and Gamarnik (Math. Oper. Res., 43(3):867-886, 2018)
identified a novel limiting diffusion process that arises as the weak-limit of
the appropriately scaled occupancy measure of the system under the JSQ policy
in the Halfin-Whitt regime, where $(N - \lambda(N)) / \sqrt{N} \to \beta > 0$
as $N \to \infty$. The analysis of this diffusion goes beyond the state of the
art techniques, and even proving its ergodicity is non-trivial, and was left as
an open question. Recently, exploiting a generator expansion framework via the
Stein's method, Braverman (arXiv:1801.05121, 2018) established its exponential
ergodicity, and adapting a regenerative approach, Banerjee and Mukherjee (Ann.

  However, the analysis of the bulk behavior of the stationary distribution,
viz., the moments, remained intractable until this work. In this paper, we
perform a thorough analysis of the bulk behavior of the stationary distribution
of the diffusion process, and discover that it exhibits different qualitative
behavior, depending on the value of the heavy-traffic parameter $\beta$.
Moreover, we obtain precise asymptotic laws of the centered and scaled steady
state distribution, as $\beta$ tends to 0 and $\infty$. Of particular interest,
we also establish a certain intermittency phenomena in the $\beta\to \infty$

smokers are motivated to quit, the majority of quit attempts fail. A number of
studies have explored the role of self-reported symptoms, physiologic
measurements, and environmental context on smoking risk, but less work has
focused on the temporal dynamics of smoking events, including daily patterns
and related nicotine effects. In this work, we examine these dynamics and
improve risk prediction by modeling smoking as a self-triggering process, in
which previous smoking events modify current risk. Specifically, we fit smoking
events self-reported by 42 smokers to a time-varying semi-parametric Hawkes
process (TV-SPHP) developed for this purpose. Results show that the TV-SPHP
achieves superior prediction performance compared to related and existing
models, with the incorporation of time-varying predictors having greatest
benefit over longer prediction windows. Moreover, the impact function
illustrates previously unknown temporal dynamics of smoking, with possible
connections to nicotine metabolism to be explored in future work through a
randomized study design. By more effectively predicting smoking events and
exploring a self-triggering component of smoking risk, this work supports
development of novel or improved cessation interventions that aim to reduce
death from smoking.

Galaxy while up to 1000 were expected. It is necessary to find more of these
peculiar and diverse stars to understand their origin and evolutionary path. We
are undertaking such a dedicated search. We plan to follow up spectroscopically
2356 targets of interest that were carefully selected using the all sky 2MASS
and WISE surveys. We have observed nearly 500 of these targets using optical
low-resolution spectrographs. These spectra were compared to synthetic spectra
from a new grid of MARCs hydrogen-deficient atmospheric models. Classical RCB
stars' photospheric temperatures range mostly from 4000 K to about 8500 K, and
therefore their spectra look very different showing the presence of carbon
molecules C$_2$ and CN up to $\sim$6800 K and solely atomic absorption lines
above that. We have put in place a series of criteria to distinguish RCB stars
from other AGB carbon-rich stars. We found 45 new RCB stars, including 30 Cold
($4000<T_{eff}<6800$ K), 14 Warm ($6800<T_{eff}<8500$ K) and one hot RCB
($T_{eff}>15000$ K). Forty of these belong to the Milky Way and five are
located in the Magellanic Clouds. We also confirmed that the long lasting
candidate KDM 5651 is indeed a new Magellanic RCB star, increasing the total
number of Magellanic Cloud RCB stars to 30. We have increased by $\sim$50\% the
total number of RCB stars known, now reaching 147. We also include a list of 14
strong RCB candidates, most certainly observed during a dust obscuration phase.
From the detection efficiency and success rate so far, we estimate that there
should be no more than 500 RCB stars/HdC stars in the Milky Way.

the increasing importance of multiple partonic interactions (MPI) at higher
$\sqrt{s}$. Motivated by this, we studied the UE activity considering charged
particles within different $p_{\rm T}$ intervals in $pp$ collisions at
$\sqrt{s}=7$\,TeV. We demonstrate that the saturations of both number and
summed $p_{\rm T}$ densities, which are commonly claimed, are only observed for
low-\pt charged particles ($0.5<p_{\rm T}<2$\,GeV/$c$). Moreover, for the
$p_{\rm T}$-integrated case ($p_{\rm T}>0.5$\,GeV/$c$) the summed $p_{\rm T}$
density is not sensitive to the variation of color reconnection (CR), however
at low-p_{\rm T} it is reduced with increasing CR, whereas an opposite
behaviour is found at intermediate-$p_{\rm T}$ ($2<p_{\rm T}<10$\,GeV/$c$).
Finally, we show that CR produces flow-like behaviour only in the UE region and
the effects are reduced with increasing $p_{\rm T}^{\rm jet}$ due to the
hardering of UE. The outcomes encourage the measurement of inclusive and

(SMBHs) with masses greater than ${\sim}10^9~M_\odot$ were assembled within the
first billion years after the Big Bang. It is unclear how such massive black
holes formed so early. One possible explanation is that these SMBHs were seeded
by `heavy' direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) with masses of $M_{\rm
BH}\approx10^5~M_\odot$, but observations have not yet confirmed or refuted
this scenario. In this Letter, we utilize a cosmological N-body simulation to
demonstrate that before they grow roughly an order of magnitude in mass, DCBHs
will have black hole mass to halo mass ratios much higher than expected for
black hole remnants of Population III (Pop III) stars which have grown to the
same mass (${\sim}10^6~M_\odot$). We also show that when $T_{\rm vir}\approx
10^4~{\rm K}$ halos (the potential sites of DCBH formation) merge with much
larger nearby halos ($M_{\rm h} > 10^{10}~M_\odot$), they almost always orbit
their larger host halos with a separation of a few kpc, which is sufficient to
be spatially resolved with future X-ray and infrared telescopes. Thus, we
propose that a future X-ray mission such as Lynx combined with infrared
observations will be able to distinguish high-redshift DCBHs from smaller black
hole seeds due to the unusually high black hole mass to stellar mass ratios of
the faintest observed quasars, with inferred BH masses below ${\sim} 10^6

For
neutral atoms, it is an outstanding challenge to design a high-fidelity
two-qubit entangling gate without resorting to difficult techniques like
shaping laser pulses or cooling atoms to motional ground states. By using spin
echo to suppress the blockade error, we propose an easily realizable
controlled-phase Rydberg quantum gate of high intrinsic fidelity. In the
context of spin echo, we show that the fundamental blockade error of the
traditional Rydberg gate, on the order of $\epsilon\sim10^{-3}$, actually
results from two `clockwise' rotations of Rabi frequencies $\bar\Omega_\pm=V\pm
\sqrt{V^2+\Omega^2}$. In our `echo' sequence, such an error can be suppressed
to the order of $\epsilon^2$ by adding two `anticlockwise' rotations with
frequencies $-\bar\Omega_\pm$. With the blockade error effectively removed, the
error caused by Rydberg state decay becomes the final fundamental limit to the
gate accuracy, which in principle, can be reduced beyond the level of
$10^{-5}$. Furthermore, due to the small population $\epsilon$ involved in the
`echo' process, the spin-echo gate is robust against the variation of Rydberg
blockade caused by the drift of the qubits, so that it can still be much more
accurate than that of a traditional Rydberg gate even for qubits cooled only to
the sub-mK regime.

the classical BST model, with connections to the well-studied $k$-server

when a query sequence has locality of reference. BSTs with multiple fingers can
exploit more general regularities in the input. In this paper we consider the
cost of serving a sequence of queries in an optimal (offline) BST with $k$
fingers, a powerful benchmark against which other algorithms can be measured.
  We show that the $k$-finger optimum can be matched by a standard dynamic BST
(having a single root-finger) with an $O(\log{k})$ factor overhead. This result
is tight for all $k$, improving the $O(k)$ factor implicit in earlier work.
Furthermore, we describe new online BSTs that match this bound up to a
$(\log{k})^{O(1)}$ factor. Previously only the ""one-finger"" special case was
known to hold for an online BST (Iacono, Langerman, 2016; Cole et al., 2000).
Splay trees, assuming their conjectured optimality (Sleator and Tarjan, 1983),
would have to match our bounds for all $k$.
  Our online algorithms are randomized and combine techniques developed for the
$k$-server problem with a multiplicative-weights scheme for learning tree
metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first time when tools developed for the
$k$-server problem are used in BSTs. As an application of our $k$-finger
results, we show that BSTs can efficiently serve queries that are close to some
recently accessed item. This is a (restricted) form of the unified property
(Iacono, 2001) that was previously not known to hold for any BST algorithm,
online or offline.

how this affects the global suspension behavior. The turbulence reduces with
the aspect ratio of oblate particles, leading to drag reduction with respect to
the single phase flow for particles with aspect ratio $\mathcal{AR}\leq1/3$,
when the significant reduction in Reynolds shear stress is more than the
compensation by the additional stresses, induced by the solid phase. Oblate
particles are found to avoid the region close to the wall, travelling parallel
to it with small angular velocities, while preferentially sampling high-speed
fluid in the wall region. Prolate particles, also tend to orient parallel to
the wall and avoid its vicinity. Their reluctancy to rotate around spanwise
axis reduce the wall-normal velocity fluctuation of the flow and therefore the
turbulence Reynolds stress similar to oblates; however, they undergo rotations
in wall-parallel planes which increases the additional solid stresses due to
their relatively larger angular velocities compared to the oblates. These
larger additional stresses compensates for the reduction in turbulence activity
and leads to a wall-drag similar to that of single-phase flows. Spheres on the
other hand, form a layer close to the wall with large angular velocities in
spanwise direction, which increases the turbulence activity in addition to
exerting the largest solid stresses on the suspension, in comparison to the
other studied shapes. Spherical particles therefore increase the wall-drag with

customers' electricity consumption to implement a gated recurrent unit

proposed RNN-based detector adopts a random search analysis in its learning
stage to appropriately fine-tune its hyper-parameters. Extensive test studies
are carried out to investigate the detector's performance using publicly

observation is approximated by a linear system. Reconstructing the object from
the observed data is therefore is equivalent to solving the modulation
equation. In this work we present the synthetic direct demodulation (synDD)
method to reduce the dimensionality of a general modulation equation and solve
the equation in its sparse representation.
  Methods. A principal component analysis is used to reduce the dimensionality
of the kernel matrix and k-means clustering is applied to its sparse
representation in order to decompose the kernel matrix into a weighted sum of a
series of circulant matrices. The matrix- vector and matrix-matrix
multiplication complexities are therefore reduced from polynomial time to
linear-logarithmic time. A general statistical solution of the modulation
equation in sparse representation is derived. Several data-analysis pipelines
are designed for the Hard X-ray modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) based on
the synDD method.
  Results. In this approach, a large set of data originating from the same
object but sampled irregularly and/or observed with different instruments in
multiple epochs can be reduced simultaneously in a synthetic observation model.
We suggest using the proposed synDD method in Insight-HXMT data analysis
especially for the detection of X-ray transients and monitoring time-varying
objects with scanning observations.

Plateau---in a fully automatic and remote mode to exploit the superb observing
conditions of the site, and its long and uninterrupted polar nights. The search
for transiting exoplanets is one of the key projects for AST3. During the
Austral winters of 2016 and 2017 we used the AST3-II telescope to survey a set
of target fields near the southern ecliptic pole, falling within the continuous
viewing zone of the TESS mission \citep{Ricker10}. The first data release of
the 2016 data, including images, catalogs and lightcurves of 26578 bright stars
($7.5\le i \le15$) was presented in \citet{Zhang18}. The best precision, as
measured by the RMS of the lightcurves at the optimum magnitude of the survey
($i=10$), is around 2\,mmag. We detect 222 objects with plausible transit
signals from these data, 116 of which are plausible transiting exoplanet
candidates according to their stellar properties as given by the TESS Input
Catalog \citep{Stassun17}, Gaia DR2 \citep{Gaia18} and TESS-HERMES spectroscopy
\citep{Sharma18}. With the first data release from TESS expected in late 2018,
this candidate list will be a timely for improving the rejection of potential
false positives.

occlusion, and truncation depends not only on feature details but also on
contextual information. Most previous networks emphasize too much on detailed
feature extraction through deeper and wider networks, which may enhance the
accuracy of object detection to certain extent. However, the feature details
are easily being changed or washed out after passing through complicated
filtering structures. To better handle these challenges, the paper proposes a
novel framework, multi-scale, deep inception convolutional neural network
(MDCN), which focuses on wider and broader object regions by activating feature
maps produced in the deep part of the network. Instead of incepting inner
layers in the shallow part of the network, multi-scale inceptions are
introduced in the deep layers. The proposed framework integrates the contextual
information into the learning process through a single-shot network structure.
It is computational efficient and avoids the hard training problem of previous
macro feature extraction network designed for shallow layers. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of MDCN over
the state-of-the-art models.

constraining the fluctuating UV background during reionization by constraining
alpha in different volumes of the Universe. Because of patchy reionization,
different volumes will experience different amount of photo-heating which
should lead to a scatter in the measured alpha. Our approach is based on a
simple model of the UV LF that is a scaled version of the halo mass function
combined with an exponential suppression in the galaxy luminosity at the
faint-end because of UV feedback. Although current data is not sufficient to
constrain alpha in different fields, we expect that, in the near future,
observations of the six lensed Hubble Frontier Fields with the James Webb Space

obtain a truthful $O(1)$-approximate mechanism for the case where bidder

low dimension representation while facing the problem that sometimes pre-set

information sparsity in factor dimension over the data intrinsic dimension and
results in some non-influential factors whose function on data reconstruction
could be ignored. We show mutual information also influences the lower bound of
VAE's reconstruction error and downstream classification task. To make such
indicator applicable, we design an algorithm for calculating the mutual
information for VAE and prove its consistency. Experimental results on MNIST,

failure. It is thus an ideal test bed for the development and deployment of
interactive artificial intelligence (AI)-based conversational agents, or
artificial improvisors. This case study introduces an improv show experiment
featuring human actors and artificial improvisors. We have previously developed
a deep-learning-based artificial improvisor, trained on movie subtitles, that
can generate plausible, context-based, lines of dialogue suitable for theatre
(Mathewson and Mirowski 2017). In this work, we have employed it to control
what a subset of human actors say during an improv performance. We also give
human-generated lines to a different subset of performers. All lines are
provided to actors with headphones and all performers are wearing headphones.
This paper describes a Turing test, or imitation game, taking place in a
theatre, with both the audience members and the performers left to guess who is
a human and who is a machine. In order to test scientific hypotheses about the
perception of humans versus machines we collect anonymous feedback from
volunteer performers and audience members. Our results suggest that rehearsal
increases proficiency and possibility to control events in the performance.
That said, consistency with real world experience is limited by the interface
and the mechanisms used to perform the show. We also show that human-generated
lines are shorter, more positive, and have less difficult words with more
grammar and spelling mistakes than the artificial improvisor generated lines.

The term stealthy has come to encompass a variety of techniques that attackers
can employ to avoid being detected. In this manuscript, for a class of
perturbed linear time-invariant systems, we propose two security metrics to
quantify the potential impact that stealthy attacks could have on the system
dynamics by tampering with sensor measurements. We provide analysis
mathematical tools (in terms of linear matrix inequalities) to quantify these
metrics for given system dynamics, control structure, system monitor, and set
of sensors being attacked. Then, we provide synthesis tools (in terms of
semidefinite programs) to redesign controllers and monitors such that the
impact of stealthy attacks is minimized and the required attack-free system
performance is guaranteed.

spontaneously, many large viruses, such as the Herpes virus or Infectious
Bursal Disease Virus (IBDV), typically require a template, consisting of either
scaffolding proteins or inner core. Despite the proliferation of large viruses
in nature, the mechanisms by which hundreds or thousands of proteins assemble
to form structures with icosahedral order (IO) is completely unknown. Using
continuum elasticity theory, we study the growth of large viral shells
(capsids) and show that a non-specific template not only selects the radius of
the capsid, but leads to the error-free assembly of protein subunits into
capsids with universal IO. We prove that as a spherical cap grows, there is a
deep potential well at the locations of disclinations that later in the
assembly process will become the vertices of an icosahedron. Furthermore, we
introduce a minimal model and simulate the assembly of viral shell around a
template under non-equilibrium conditions and find a perfect match between the
results of continuum elasticity theory and the numerical simulations. Besides
explaining available experimental results, we provide a number of new
predictions. Implications for other problems in spherical crystals are also
discussed.

critical but underexplored topic in interpretable visual question answering
systems. Although very recent studies have attempted to use explicit
compositional processes to assemble multiple subtasks embedded in questions,
their models heavily rely on annotations or handcrafted rules to obtain valid
reasoning processes, which leads to either heavy workloads or poor performance
on compositional reasoning. In this paper, to better align image and language
domains in diverse and unrestricted cases, we propose a novel neural network
model that performs global reasoning on a dependency tree parsed from the
question; thus, our model is called a parse-tree-guided reasoning network
(PTGRN). This network consists of three collaborative modules: i) an attention
module that exploits the local visual evidence of each word parsed from the
question, ii) a gated residual composition module that composes the previously
mined evidence, and iii) a parse-tree-guided propagation module that passes the
mined evidence along the parse tree. Thus, PTGRN is capable of building an
interpretable visual question answering (VQA) system that gradually derives
image cues following question-driven parse-tree reasoning. Experiments on
relational datasets demonstrate the superiority of PTGRN over current
state-of-the-art VQA methods, and the visualization results highlight the
explainable capability of our reasoning system.

Conditional models are frequently encountered in practice; however there has
not been a rigorous theoretical analysis of NCE in this setting, and we will
argue there are subtle but important questions when generalizing NCE to the

models: one based on a classification objective, the other based on a ranking
objective. We show that the ranking-based variant of NCE gives consistent
parameter estimates under weaker assumptions than the classification-based

using dialog history as context. In addition to the challenges found in visual
question answering (VQA), which can be seen as one-round dialog, visual dialog
encompasses several more. We focus on one such problem called visual
coreference resolution that involves determining which words, typically noun
phrases and pronouns, co-refer to the same entity/object instance in an image.
This is crucial, especially for pronouns (e.g., `it'), as the dialog agent must
first link it to a previous coreference (e.g., `boat'), and only then can rely
on the visual grounding of the coreference `boat' to reason about the pronoun
`it'. Prior work (in visual dialog) models visual coreference resolution either
(a) implicitly via a memory network over history, or (b) at a coarse level for
the entire question; and not explicitly at a phrase level of granularity. In
this work, we propose a neural module network architecture for visual dialog by
introducing two novel modules - Refer and Exclude - that perform explicit,
grounded, coreference resolution at a finer word level. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model on MNIST Dialog, a visually simple yet
coreference-wise complex dataset, by achieving near perfect accuracy, and on

multivariate time series data consisting of a large number of system
measurements over a period of time. Such data can be interpreted as a sequence
of states, where each state represents a prototype of system behavior. An
important problem in this domain is to identify repeated sequences of states,
known as motifs. Such motifs correspond to complex behaviors that capture
common sequences of state transitions. For example, in automotive data, a motif
of ""making a turn"" might manifest as a sequence of states: slowing down,
turning the wheel, and then speeding back up. However, discovering these motifs
is challenging, because the individual states and state assignments are
unknown, have different durations, and need to be jointly learned from the
noisy time series. Here we develop motif-aware state assignment (MASA), a
method to discover common motifs in noisy time series data and leverage those
motifs to more robustly assign states to measurements. We formulate the problem
of motif discovery as a large optimization problem, which we solve using an
expectation-maximization type approach. MASA performs well in the presence of
noise in the input data and is scalable to very large datasets. Experiments on
synthetic data show that MASA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to
38.2%, and two case studies demonstrate how our approach discovers insightful

set of $n \times n$ positive semidefinite matrices with positive entries, then
$f$ and its first $n-1$ derivatives are non-negative on $(0,\infty)$. In a

  A key step in the proof is a new determinantal / symmetric function

from considering arbitrary entrywise maps that are sufficiently differentiable.
Of independent interest may be the following application to symmetric function
theory: we extend the Schur function expansion of Cauchy's (1841) determinant

a determinant of Frobenius [J. reine angew. Math. 1882] (whose matrix entries

Eventually, if TDD outperformed their traditional way of coding (i.e., YW,

empirical evidence achieved at the company level. We conduct an experiment at
Paf to evaluate the performance of TDD, YW and the reverse approach of TDD

YW and ITL at Paf. Despite the encouraging results, we cannot recommend Paf to
immediately adopt TDD as the difference in performance between YW and TDD is
small. However, as TDD looks promising at Paf, we suggest to move some

neural network classifiers for alternative classification tasks without
modification to the original network. An adversary in such an attack scenario
trains an additive contribution to the inputs to repurpose the neural network
for the new classification task. While this reprogramming approach works for
neural networks with a continuous input space such as that of images, it is not
directly applicable to neural networks trained for tasks such as text
classification, where the input space is discrete. Repurposing such
classification networks would require the attacker to learn an adversarial
program that maps inputs from one discrete space to the other. In this work, we
introduce a context-based vocabulary remapping model to reprogram neural
networks trained on a specific sequence classification task, for a new sequence
classification task desired by the adversary. We propose training procedures
for this adversarial program in both white-box and black-box settings. We
demonstrate the application of our model by adversarially repurposing various

of its modes as an electron-positron FCC-ee machine. We give an overview
comparing the theoretical status to the experimental demands of one of four
foreseen FCC-ee operating stages, Z-boson resonance energy physics, called the
FCC-ee Tera-Z stage for short. The FCC-ee Tera-Z will deliver the highest
integrated luminosities as well as very small systematic errors for a study of
the Standard Model (SM) with unprecedented precision. In fact, the FCC-ee
Tera-Z will allow the study of at least one more perturbative order in quantum
field theory compared to the LEP/SLC precision. The real problem is that the
present precision of theoretical calculations of the various SM observables
does not match that of the anticipated experimental measurements. The
bottle-necks to overcoming this situation are identified. In particular, the
issues of precise QED unfolding and the correct calculation of SM
pseudo-observables are critically reviewed. In an Executive Summary, we specify
which basic theoretical calculations are needed to meet the strong experimental
expectations at the FCC-ee Tera-Z. Several methods, techniques and tools needed
for higher-order multi-loop calculations are presented. By inspection of the
Z-boson partial and total decay width analyses, it is argued that at the
beginning of operation of the FCC-ee Tera-Z, the theory predictions may be
tuned to be precise enough not to limit the physics interpretation of the
measurements. This statement is based on anticipated progress in analytical and
numerical calculations of multi-loop and multi-scale Feynman integrals and on
the completion of two-loop electroweak radiative corrections to the SM
pseudo-observables this year. However, the above statement is conditional as
the theoretical issues demand a very dedicated and focused investment by the
community.

overlapping blocks of repeated observations within each subject to draw valid

show an increase in power compared to merge-by-subject (MBS) strategies. We
also show that compared to tests that presume independent samples (PIS), our
proposed method reduces false microbial biomarker discovery rates.

described in the framework of the Weak Turbulence Theory. The theory is based
on the hypothesis of an asymptotically large system. In experiments, the
systems have a finite size and the predictions of the theory may not apply
because of the presence of discrete modes rather than a continuum of free
waves. Our study focusses on the case of waves at the surface of water at
scales close to the gravity-capillarity crossover (of order 1~cm). Wave
turbulence has peculiar properties in this regime because 1D resonant
interactions can occur as shown by Aubourg \& Mordant. Here we investigate the
influence of the confinement on the properties of wave turbulence by reducing
gradually the size of our wave tank along one of its axis, the size in the
other direction being unchanged. We use space-time resolved profilometry to
reconstruct the deformed surface of water. We observe an original regime of
coexistence of weak wave turbulence along the length of the vessel and discrete

dose deposition to all other tissues. However, in practice the planned dose
distribution may not conform to the actual one due to noisy data and different
types of errors. One such error comes in a form of potentially inaccurate
conversion of the Hounsfield units (HU) to stopping powers (SP) of protons. We
propose a method of improving the CC based on a planning CT and proton range
measurements acquired during treatment. The range data were simulated using a
virtual CC and a planning CT. The range data were given two types of noise:
range shift due to patient setup errors; and range noise due to measurement
imprecision, including a misalignment of the range measuring device. The method
consists of two parts. The first part involves a Taylor expansion of the water
equivalent path length (WEPL) map in terms of the range shift caused by the
difference between the planning and the virtual CC. The range shift is then
solved for explicitly, leading to a polynomial function of the difference
between the two CCs. The second part consists in minimizing a score function
relating the range due to the virtual CC and the range due to the optimized CC.
Tested on ten different CCs, our results show that, with range data collected
over a few fractions (less than 10), the optimized CC leads to an overall
reduction of the range difference. More precisely, on average, the uncertainty
of the CC was reduced from 2.67% to 1.62%, while the average reduction of the
WEPL bias was reduced from 2.14% to 0.74%. The advantage of our method over
others is 1) its speed, and 2) the fact that the range data it necessitates are
acquired during the treatment itself, and as such it does not burden the
patient with additional dose.

radio-frequency reflectometry on a single gate electrode defining the quantum

thus far it has not been possible to achieve single-shot spin readout using

of the dispersion map include random dispersion fluctuations. Effects of the
gain dispersion, higher-order nonlinearity and randomness on the generation of
DMDS are demonstrated. The solitons exhibit breather-like evolution, and are
found to be robust, up to a certain critical level of the random-dispersion
component, which is sufficiently high. The roles of multiphoton absorption,
gain dispersion and nonlinearity on the DMDS are also identified in the absence
of randomness. Pair wise interactions of solitons lead, most typically, to
their merger, with breaking of the left-right symmetry. The outcome of the
collisions is more sensitive to the initial temporal separation between the
solitons than to their phase difference.

phenomena, such as cell fate and chemotherapeutic resistance. The role of
metabolism, and particularly mitochondria, is increasingly being recognised as
an important explanatory factor in cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Most eukaryotic
cells possess a population of mitochondria, in the sense that mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) is held in multiple copies per cell, where the sequence of each
molecule can vary. Hence intra-cellular mitochondrial heterogeneity is
possible, which can induce inter-cellular mitochondrial heterogeneity, and may
drive aspects of cellular noise. In this review, we discuss sources of
mitochondrial heterogeneity (variations between mitochondria in the same cell,
and mitochondrial variations between supposedly identical cells) from both
genetic and non-genetic perspectives, and mitochondrial genotype-phenotype
links. We discuss the apparent homeostasis of mtDNA copy number, the
observation of pervasive intra-cellular mtDNA mutation (we term
`microheteroplasmy') and developments in the understanding of inter-cellular
mtDNA mutation (`macroheteroplasmy'). We point to the relationship between
mitochondrial supercomplexes, cristal structure, pH and cardiolipin as a
potential amplifier of the mitochondrial genotype-phenotype link. We also
discuss mitochondrial membrane potential and networks as sources of
mitochondrial heterogeneity, and their influence upon the mitochondrial genome.
Finally, we revisit the idea of mitochondrial complementation as a means of
dampening mitochondrial genotype-phenotype links in light of recent
experimental developments. The diverse sources of mitochondrial heterogeneity,
as well as their increasingly recognised role in contributing to cellular
heterogeneity, highlights the need for future single-cell mitochondrial
measurements in the context of cellular noise studies.

proportionally modulated by the (physical) fraction of unfused mitochondria,
independently of the absolute fission-fusion rate. In the context of selective

recently-discovered white dwarf pulsar AR Scorpii. Our extensive dataset
reveals that the polarized emission is remarkably stable and repeatable with
spin, beat and orbital modulations. This has enabled us to construct a simple
geometrical model which assumes that all of the optically polarized emission
emanates from two diametrically opposed synchrotron emission regions on the
white dwarf magnetosphere. We suggest that the observed polarimetric
modulations occur as a result of an enhanced injection of relativistic
electrons into the magnetosphere of the white dwarf as it sweeps past the
M-dwarf. This leads to an increase in synchrotron emission as the injected
electrons accelerate towards each magnetic mirror point close to the magnetic
poles of the white dwarf. Whilst this scenario reproduces the detailed
polarimetric modulations, other suggested scenarios involving emission sites
locked in the white dwarf rotating frame are not ruled out. For example,
pulsar-like particle acceleration as a result of either electric potentials
between the white dwarf and the light cylinder or a striped relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic wind, outside the light cylinder. Previous conclusions that
argued that the observed strong optical beat modulations require that the
optical polarization arises predominantly from or near the M-dwarf are
inconsistent with our observations.

holomorphic and antiholomorphic continuous Virasoro algebras at the tachyon

learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, following a surge of
innovative GPU technology, high-resolution, big datasets and thriving machine
learning algorithms. However, there are few examples exploiting this emerging
technology to develop applications for traffic prediction. This is largely due
to the difficulty in capturing random, seasonal, non-linear, and
spatio-temporal correlated nature of traffic data. In this paper, we propose a
data-driven modelling approach with a novel hierarchical D-CLSTM-t deep
learning model for short-term traffic speed prediction, a framework combined
with convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM)
models. A deep CNN model is employed to learn the spatio-temporal traffic
patterns of the input graphs, which are then fed into a deep LSTM model for
sequence learning. To capture traffic seasonal variations, time of the day and
day of the week indicators are fused with trained features. The model is
trained end-to-end to predict travel speed in 15 to 90 minutes in the future.
We compare the model performance against other baseline models including CNN,
LGBM, LSTM, and traditional speed-flow curves. Experiment results show that the
D-CLSTM-t outperforms other models considerably. Model tests show that speed
upstream also responds sensibly to a sudden accident occurring downstream. Our
D-CLSTM-t model framework is also highly scalable for future extension such as
for network-wide traffic prediction, which can also be improved by including
additional features such as weather, long term seasonality and accident
information.

with high conversion efficiency in periodically poled Lithium Niobate (PPLN).
In the multi-stage terahertz generation system, the pump pulse is recycled
after each PPLN stage for further terahertz generation. By out-coupling the
terahertz radiation generated in each stage, extra absorption is circumvented
and effective interaction length is increased. The separation of the terahertz
and optical pulses at each stage is accomplished by an appropriately designed
out-coupler. To evaluate the proposed architecture, the governing 2-D coupled
wave equations in a cylindrically symmetric geometry are numerically solved
using the finite difference method. Compared to the 1-D calculation which
cannot capture the self-focusing and diffraction effects, our 2-D numerical
method captures the effects of difference frequency generation, self-phase
modulation, self-focusing, beam diffraction, dispersion, and terahertz
absorption. We found that the terahertz generation efficiency can be greatly
enhanced by compensating the dispersion of the pump pulse after each stage.
With a two-stage system, we predict the generation of a $17.6$ mJ terahertz
pulse with total conversion efficiency $\eta_{\text{total}}=1.6\%$ at $0.3$ THz
using a 1.1 J pump laser with a two-line spectrum centered at 1 $\mu$m. The
generation efficiency of each stage is above $0.8\%$ with the out-coupling
efficiencies above $93.0\%$.

NP-complete when general rules such as wildcard expressions are used. Yet,
network analyzer tools such as Netplumber (Kazemian et al., NSDI'13) or
Veriflow (Khurshid et al., NSDI'13) efficiently solve this problem in networks
with thousands of forwarding rules. In this paper, we complement such
experimental validation of practical heuristics with the first provably
efficient algorithm in the context of general rules. Our main tool is a
canonical representation of the atoms (i.e. the minimal non-empty sets) of the
field of sets generated by a collection of sets. This tool is particularly
suited when the intersection of two sets can be efficiently computed and
represented. In the case of forwarding networks, each forwarding rule is
associated with the set of packet headers it matches. The atoms then correspond
to classes of headers with same behavior in the network. We propose an
algorithm for atom computation and provide the first polynomial time algorithm
for loop detection in terms of number of classes (which can be exponential in
general). This contrasts with previous methods that can be exponential, even in
simple cases with linear number of classes. Second, we introduce a notion of
network dimension captured by the overlapping degree of forwarding rules. The
values of this measure appear to be very low in practice and constant
overlapping degree ensures polynomial number of header classes. Forwarding loop
detection is thus polynomial in forwarding networks with constant overlapping
degree.

tightly-focused laser pulse on the dynamics of a counter-propagating electron
beam have been investigated in the, so-called, electron reflection regime,
requiring the Lorentz factor of the electron $\gamma$ to be approximately two
orders of magnitudes lower than the dimensionless laser field parameter $\xi$.
The electrons are reflected at the rising edge of the laser pulse due to the
ponderomotive force of the focused laser beam, and an asymmetric electron
angular distribution emerges along the laser polarization direction, which
sensitively depends on the CEP of the driving laser pulse for weak radiative
stochastic effects. The CEP siganatures are observable at laser intensities of
the order or larger than $10^{19}$ W/cm$^2$ and the pulse duration up to 10
cycles. The CEP detection resolution is proportional to the electron beam
density and can achieve approximately $0.1^{\circ}$ at an electron density of
about $10^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$. The method is applicable for currently available
ultraintense laser facilities with the laser peak power from tens of terawatt
to multi-petawatt region.

composition of thin films of Ru on B, C and B4C films at different stages of
growth. Effects of surface segregation of C were observed. Previously unknown
matrix effects were observed in these samples, expressed in the decrease of
LEIS signals of Ru, B and C at low Ru concentrations. The effect disappears for
Ru-rich surfaces. Measurements with different He+ ion energies prove that the
characteristic velocities of the elements involved change with surface
composition. We suggest that these matrix effects appear due to the changes in
neutralization efficiency in quasiresonant neutralization from the valence band
(VB-qRN). This neutralization channel is present in elemental C and B due to a
wide valence band with energy states as low as -20 eV, which are in a
(quasi-)resonance with the He 1s level. This mechanism was earlier reported for
graphitic carbon. We suggest that it can be applied to a much wider range of
materials, leading to potential matrix effects in LEIS from a variety of
surfaces, containing B, C and potentially O and N atoms, e.g. borides,
carbides, oxides and nitrides, as well as alloys with B and C. This hypothesis
is supported by additional LEIS measurements on oxidized Ru which show matrix
effect in Ru-O LEIS signals as well. We argue that it is possible to avoid the
matrix effects from compounded surfaces within certain ranges of composition by
a proper choice of reference samples, while for other compositions knowledge of
characteristic velocities is required for reliable quantification.

  Association with coronary artery disease",,,"10.1002/mp.13186",,"physics.med-ph cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: The motion of the common carotid artery tissue layers along the
vessel axis during the cardiac cycle, observed in ultrasound imaging, is
associated with the presence of established cardiovascular risk factors.
However, the vast majority of the methods are based on the tracking of a single
point, thus failing to capture the overall motion of the entire arterial wall.
The aim of this work is to introduce a motion tracking framework able to
simultaneously extract the trajectory of a large collection of points spanning
the entire exploitable width of the image.
  Method: The longitudinal motion, which is the main focus of the present work,
is determined in two steps. First, a series of independent block matching
operations are carried out for all the tracked points. Then, an original
dynamic-programming approach is exploited to regularize the collection of
similarity maps and estimate the globally optimal motion over the entire vessel
wall. Sixty-two atherosclerotic participants at high cardiovascular risk were
involved in this study.
  Results: A dense displacement field, describing the longitudinal motion of
the carotid far wall over time, was extracted. For each cine-loop, the method
was evaluated against manual reference tracings performed on three local
points, with an average absolute error of 150+/-163 um. A strong correlation
was found between motion inhomogeneity and the presence of coronary artery
disease (beta-coefficient=0.586, p=0.003).
  Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a
method is specifically proposed to assess the dense motion field of the carotid
far wall. This approach has potential to evaluate the (in)homogeneity of the
wall dynamics. The proposed method has promising performances to improve the
analysis of arterial longitudinal motion and the understanding of the
underlying patho-physiological parameters.

in luminosity by 1$-$2 orders of magnitude, followed by slow return to the
pre-outburst state on timescales of $\sim$10$-$100 yr. The outburst strongly
affects the entire disk, changing its thermal structure and radiation field. In
this paper, using a detailed physical-chemical model we study the impact of the
FU Ori outburst on the disk chemical inventory. Our main goal is to identify
gas-phase molecular tracers of the outburst activity that could be observed
after the outburst with modern telescopes such as ALMA and NOEMA. We find that
the majority of molecules experience a considerable increase in the total disk
gas-phase abundances due to the outburst, mainly due to the sublimation of
their ices. Their return to the pre-outburst chemical state takes different
amounts of time, from nearly instantaneous to very long. Among the former ones
we identify CO, NH$_3$, C$_2$H$_6$, C$_3$H$_4$, etc. Their abundance evolution
tightly follows the luminosity curve. For CO the abundance increase does not
exceed an order of magnitude, while for other tracers the abundances increase
by 2$-$5 orders of magnitude. Other molecules like H$_2$CO and NH$_2$OH have
longer retention timescales, remaining in the gas phase for $\sim10-10^3$ yr
after the end of the outburst. Thus H$_2$CO could be used as an indicator of
the previous outbursts in the post-outburst FU Ori systems. We investigate the
corresponding time-dependent chemistry in detail and present the most favorable
transitions and ALMA configurations for future observations.

established, on other side a number of experiments and their theoretical
interpretation suggest a rich physics of strong correlations at finite
temperature. In this work we use an ab-initio scheme based on the Random Phase
Approximation and Local Spin Density Approximation (RPA@LSDA) to reveal the
role of the electron correlation effects in FeSi extending it by applying a
fixed spin moment constraint. In the parameter free framework we show that
correlation effects essentially alter the one-electron LSDA results leading to
the formation of an additional state with finite magnetic moment on Fe, whose
energy is almost degenerate with the non-magnetic ground state. This explains
the results of high field experiments, which found a first-order meta-magnetic
phase transition into a metallic ferromagnetic state. Our results suggest a
strongly correlated nature of the low-energy excitations in FeSi. From our
super-cells calculations we reveal that these excitations are local and exhibit
a Kondo-like behavior since a strong antiferromagnetic screening is present.

  Recognition","AAAI 2019",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Visible (VIS) to near infrared (NIR) face matching is a challenging problem
due to the significant domain discrepancy between the domains and a lack of
sufficient data for training cross-modal matching algorithms. Existing
approaches attempt to tackle this problem by either synthesizing visible faces
from NIR faces, extracting domain-invariant features from these modalities, or
projecting heterogeneous data onto a common latent space for cross-modal
matching. In this paper, we take a different approach in which we make use of
the Disentangled Variational Representation (DVR) for cross-modal matching.
First, we model a face representation with an intrinsic identity information
and its within-person variations. By exploring the disentangled latent variable
space, a variational lower bound is employed to optimize the approximate
posterior for NIR and VIS representations. Second, aiming at obtaining more
compact and discriminative disentangled latent space, we impose a minimization
of the identity information for the same subject and a relaxed correlation
alignment constraint between the NIR and VIS modality variations. An
alternative optimization scheme is proposed for the disentangled variational
representation part and the heterogeneous face recognition network part. The
mutual promotion between these two parts effectively reduces the NIR and VIS
domain discrepancy and alleviates over-fitting. Extensive experiments on three
challenging NIR-VIS heterogeneous face recognition databases demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art
methods.

printed circuit board (PCB) metagrating (MG) for perfect anomalous reflection.
The design follows our previously developed analytical formalism, resulting in
a single-element MG capable of unitary coupling of the incident wave to the
specified (first order) Floquet-Bloch (FB) mode while suppressing the specular
reflection. We characterize the MG performance experimentally using a bistatic
scattering pattern measurement, relying on an original beam-power integration
approach for accurate evaluation of the coupling to the various modes across a
wide frequency range. The results show that highly-efficient wide-angle
anomalous reflection is achieved, as predicted by the theory, with a relatively
broadband response. In addition, the MG is found to perform well when
illuminated from different angles, acting as a multichannel reflector, and to
scatter efficiently also to higher-order FB modes at other frequencies,
exhibiting multifunctional capabilities. Importantly, the merits of the
introduced beam-integration approach, namely, its improved resilience to
measurement inaccuracies or noise effects, and the implicit accommodation of
different effective aperture sizes, are emphasized, highly relevant in view of
the numerous recent experimental reports on anomalous reflection metasurfaces.
Finally, we discuss the source for losses associated with the MG;
interestingly, we show that these correlate well with edge diffraction effects,
rather than (commonly assumed) power dissipation. These experimental results
verify our theoretical synthesis scheme, showing that highly-efficient
anomalous reflection is achievable with a realistic fabricated MG,
demonstrating the practical applicability and potential mutifunctionality of
analytically designed MGs for future wavefront manipulating devices.

entire phase diagram of the model and from the scaling analysis of the
numerical data we obtained the correlation length exponent. For both the
critical Binder cumulant and the correlation length exponent, we observed a
crossover from classical- to quantum-fluctuation-dominated values at a finite
temperature. We studied the behavior of the order parameter distribution of the
model in the glass phase (at finite and zero temperatures). Along with a
classical-fluctuation-dominated nonergodic region (where the replica symmetry
is broken), we also found a quantum-fluctuation-dominated low-temperature
ergodic region in the spin glass phase. In this quantum-fluctuation-dominated
region, the order parameter distribution has a narrow peak around its most
probable value, eventually becoming a delta function in the
infinite-system-size limit (indicating replica symmetry restoration or
ergodicity in the system). We also found that the annealing time (to reach a
very low energy level of the classical SK model) becomes practically
system-size-independent when the annealing paths pass through this ergodic
region. In contrast, when such paths pass through the nonergodic region, the
convergence time grows rapidly with the system size. We present a new study of
the autocorrelation of the spins in both ergodic and nonergodic regions. We
found a significant increase in the relaxation time (and also a change in the
relaxation behavior) in the classical-fluctuation-dominated (nonergodic) region

placement of the ultrasound transducer along the forearm is identified using
freehand 3D reconstructions of the muscle thickness during rest and motion
completion. From the ultrasound images acquired from the optimally placed
transducer, we determine classification accuracy with equally spaced scanlines
across the cross-sectional field-of-view (FOV). Furthermore, we investigated
the unique contribution of each scanline to class discrimination using Fisher
criteria (FC) and mutual information (MI) with respect to motion
discriminability. Results: Experiments with 5 able-bodied subjects show that
the maximum muscle deformation occurred between 30-50% of the forearm length
for multiple degrees-of-freedom. The average classification accuracy was 94.6%
with the entire 128 scanline image and 94.5% with 4 equally-spaced scanlines.
However, no significant improvement in classification accuracy was observed
with optimal scanline selection using FC and MI. Conclusion: For an optimally
placed transducer, a small subset of ultrasound scanlines can be used instead
of a full imaging array without sacrificing performance in terms of
classification accuracy for multiple degrees-of-freedom. Significance: The
selection of a small subset of transducer elements can enable the reduction of

  Constraints",,,,,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automated software verification of concurrent programs is challenging because
of exponentially large state spaces with respect to the number of threads and
number of events per thread. Verification techniques such as model checking
need to explore a large number of possible executions that are possible under a
non-deterministic scheduler. State space reduction techniques such as partial
order reduction simplify the verification problem, however, the reduced state
space may still be exponentially large and intractable.
  This paper discusses \emph{Iteratively Relaxed Scheduling}, a framework that
uses scheduling constraints in order to simplify the verification problem and
enable automated verification of programs which could not be handled with fully
non-deterministic scheduling. Program executions are safe as long as the same
scheduling constraints are enforced under which the program has been verified,
e.g., by instrumenting a program with additional synchronization. As strict
enforcement of scheduling constraints may induce a high execution time
overhead, we present optimizations over a naive solution that reduce this
overhead. Our evaluation of a prototype implementation on well-known benchmark
programs shows the effect of scheduling constraints on the execution time
overhead and how this overhead can be reduced by relaxing and choosing
constraints.

main telescope and a piggybacked 0.35 meter Cassegrain for tracking. Although
small, the observatory's telescope and detector system has capabilities that
are equivalent to most other institutional optical SETI facilities (Schuetz, M.
et al., 2016). The optical SETI detectors at Boquete have evolved through many
stages from a three photomultiplier coincidence detector to the current single
photomultiplier version capable of detecting pulse widths up to 50 ns and for
coincidence detection against a wide range of stellar background counts. The
Owl Observatory photometer has similarly been in continuous development to
improve performance. These activities have sought to provide practical
solutions to the needs of optical SETI.
  Over the past 5 years the search for laser like signals at Boquete has
included over 5000 stellar objects. Yet, until early 2017 year there were large
gaps in the search parameters that limited the thoroughness of those
searches.Reported herein are developments that have filled many of those gaps
further extending the search boundaries. With the new capabilities, the search
through the list of stellar candidates out to 200 ly was begun anew.

Universe, characterized by sharing a convenient parametrization of the energy
budget in terms of the deceleration parameter, are classified. Finite-time
future singularities are known to appear in many cosmological scenarios, in
particular, in the presence of viscosity or non-gravitational interactions, the
last being known to be able to suppress or just change in some cases the type
of the cosmological singularity. Here, a family of models with a
parametrization of the energy budget in terms of the deceleration parameter are
studied in the light of Gaussian processes using reconstructed data from
$40$-value $H(z)$ datasets. Eventually, the form of the possible
non-gravitational interaction between dark energy and dark matter is
constructed from these smoothed $H(z)$ data. Using phase space analysis, it is
shown that a non-interacting model with dark energy $\omega_\mathrm{de} =
\omega_{0} + \omega_{1}q$ ($q$ being the deceleration parameter) may evolve,
after starting from a matter dominated unstable state, into a de Sitter
Universe (the solution being in fact a stable node). Moreover, for a model with
interaction term $Q = 3 H b \rho_\mathrm{dm}$ ($b$ is a parameter and $H$ the
Hubble constant) three stable critical points are obtained, what may have
important astrophysical implications. In addition, part of the paper is devoted
to a general discussion of the finite-time future singularities obtained from
direct numerical integration of the field equations, since they appear in many
cosmological scenarios and could be useful for future extended studies of the
models here introduced. Numerical solutions for the new models, produce
finite-time future singularities of Type I or Type III, or an
$\omega$-singularity, provided general relativity describes the background
dynamics.

on temperatures such that ions (protons) are sub-relativistic and electrons are

preferentially heated, gaining up to an order of magnitude more energy than
electrons, and propose a simple empirical formula to describe the electron-ion
energy partition as a function of the ratio of electron-to-ion gyroradii (which
in turn is a function of initial temperatures and plasma beta). We also find
that while efficient nonthermal particle acceleration occurs for both species

diminished with decreasing temperature whereas nonthermal ion populations are
essentially unchanged. These results have implications for modeling and

Theoretical studies have shown that the update rules chosen to model individual
decision making can dramatically modify the evolutionary outcome of the
population as a whole. This hints at the complexities of considering the
personality of individuals in a population, where each one uses its own rule.
Here, we investigate whether and how heterogeneity in the rules of behavior
update alters the evolutionary outcome. We assume that individuals update
behaviors by aspiration-based self-evaluation and they do so in their own ways.
Under weak selection, we analytically reveal a simple property that holds for
any two-strategy multi-player games in well-mixed populations and on regular
graphs: the evolutionary outcome in a population with heterogeneous update
rules is the weighted average of the outcomes in the corresponding homogeneous
populations, and the associated weights are the frequencies of each update rule
in the heterogeneous population. Beyond weak selection, we show that this
property holds for public goods games. Our finding implies that heterogeneous
aspiration dynamics is additive. This additivity greatly reduces the complexity
induced by the underlying individual heterogeneity. Our work thus provides an
efficient method to calculate evolutionary outcomes under heterogeneous update
rules.

of similar mass to K2-264, these planets do not appear to have significantly
inflated radii, as has previously been noted for some cluster planets. As the
second known system of multiple planets transiting a star in a cluster, K2-264
should be valuable for testing theories of photoevaporation in systems of
multiple planets. Follow-up observations with current near-infrared (NIR)
spectrographs could yield planet mass measurements, which would provide
information about the mean densities and compositions of small planets soon
after photoevaporation is expected to have finished. Follow-up NIR transit
observations using Spitzer or large ground-based telescopes could yield
improved radius estimates, further enhancing the characterization of these
interesting planets.

particular, we focus on search on the complete graph and on the star graph of
order $N$, proving that also the latter is optimal in the computational limit
$N \gg 1$, being nearly optimal also for small $N$. The noise is modeled by
independent sources of random telegraph noise (RTN), dynamically perturbing the
links of the graph. We observe two different behaviours depending on the
switching rate of RTN: fast noise only slightly degrades performance, whereas
slow noise is more detrimental and, in general, lowers the success probability.
In particular, we still find a quadratic speed-up for the average running time
of the algorithm, while for the star graph with external target node we observe
a transition to classical scaling. We also address how the effects of noise
depend on the order of the graphs, and discuss the role of the graph topology.
Overall, our results suggest that realizations of quantum spatial search are
possible with current technology, and also indicate the star graph as the
perfect candidate for the implementation by noisy quantum walks, owing to its
simple topology and nearly optimal performance also for just few nodes.

optimal control problems with fractional Laplacian type operators in
constraints discretized on large $n^{\otimes d}$ tensor-product Cartesian
grids. The approach is based on the rank-structured approximation of the matrix
valued functions of the corresponding fractional finite difference Laplacian.
We solve the equation for the control function, where the system matrix
includes the sum of the fractional $d$-dimensional Laplacian and its inverse.
The matrix valued functions of discrete Laplace operator on a tensor grid are
diagonalized by using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Then the low rank
approximation of the $d$-dimensional tensors obtained by folding of the
corresponding large diagonal matrices of eigenvalues are computed, which allows
to solve the governing equation for the control function in a tensor-structured
format. The existence of low rank canonical approximation to the class of
matrix valued functions involved is justified by using the sinc quadrature
approximation method applied to the Laplace transform of the generating
function. The linear system of equations for the control function is solved by
the PCG iterative method with the rank truncation at each iteration step, where
the low Kronecker rank preconditioner is precomputed. The right-hand side, the
solution vector, and the governing system matrix are maintained in the
rank-structured tensor format which beneficially reduces the numerical cost to
$O(n\log n)$, outperforming the standard FFT based methods of complexity
$O(n^3\log n)$ for 3D case. Numerical tests for the 2D and 3D control problems
confirm the linear complexity scaling of the method in the univariate grid size
$n$.

subjected to external precessional torques (e.g., as in the `Bardeen-Petterson'

speeds examined, we find that the influence of the sound speed can be
encapsulated in a simple ""lumped-parameter"" model proposed by Sorathia et al.
(2013a). In this model, alignment fronts propagate outward at a speed ~0.2
rOmega_precess(r), where Omega_precess is the local test-particle precession
frequency. Meanwhile, transonic radial motions transport angular momentum both
inward and outward at a rate that may be described roughly in terms of an
orientation diffusion model with diffusion coefficient ~2c_s^2/Omega, for local
orbital frequency Omega. The competition between the two leads, in isothermal
disks, to a stationary position for the alignment front at a radius
proportional to c_s^(-4/5). For alignment to happen at all, the disk must
either be turbulent due to the magnetorotational instability in MHD, or, in HD,
it must be cool enough for the bending waves driven by disk warp to be
nonlinear at their launch point. Contrary to long-standing predictions, warp
propagation in MHD disks is diffusive independent of the parameter c_s/(alpha
v_orb$, for orbital speed v_orb and ratio of stress to pressure of alpha. In
purely HD disks, i.e., those with no internal stresses other than bulk
viscosity, warmer disks align weakly or not at all; cooler disks align
qualitatively similarly to MHD disks.

the prevalence (or `relative frequency') in $\sigma$ of each class $c_{i}\in

each item in $\sigma$ and counting how many such items have been labelled with
$c_{i}$, it has long been shown that this `classify and count' (CC) method

longer considered a mere byproduct of classification, and has evolved as a task
of its own. While the scientific community has devoted a lot of attention to
devising more accurate quantification methods, it has not devoted much to
discussing what properties an \emph{evaluation measure for quantification}
(EMQ) should enjoy, and which EMQs should be adopted as a result. This paper
lies down a number of interesting properties that an EMQ may or may not enjoy,
discusses if (and when) each of these properties is desirable, surveys the EMQs
that have been used so far, and discusses whether they enjoy or not the above
properties. As a result of this investigation, some of the EMQs that have been
used in the literature turn out to be severely unfit, while others emerge as
closer to what the quantification community actually needs. However, a
significant result is that no existing EMQ satisfies all the properties
identified as desirable, thus indicating that more research is needed in order

barriers, contemporary contact between previously isolated species can occur
across great distances, and in some cases, may be inter-oceanic. [..] in the
minke whale species complex [...] migrations [..] have been documented and
fertile hybrids and back-crossed individuals between both species have also
been identified. However, it is not known whether this represents a
contemporary event, potentially driven by ecosystem changes in the Antarctic,
or a sporadic occurrence happening over an evolutionary time-scale. We
successfully used whole genome resequencing to identify a panel of diagnostic
SNPs which now enable us address this evolutionary question.
  Results: A large number of SNPs displaying fixed or nearly fixed allele
frequency differences among the minke whale species were identified from the
sequence data. Five panels of putatively diagnostic markers were established on
a genotyping platform for validation of allele frequencies; two panels (26 and
24 SNPs) separating the two species of minke whale, and three panels (22, 23,
and 24 SNPs) differentiating the three subspecies of common minke whale. The
panels were validated against a set of reference samples, demonstrating the
ability to accurately identify back-crossed whales up to three generations.
  Conclusions: This work has resulted in the development of a panel of novel
diagnostic genetic markers to address inter-oceanic and global contact among
the genetically isolated minke whale species and sub-species. These markers,
including a globally relevant genetic reference data set for this species
complex, are now openly available for researchers [..]. The approach used here,
combining whole genome resequencing and high-throughput genotyping, represents
a universal approach to develop similar tools for other species and population
complexes.

transient in a given direction it is necessarily ballistic. In order to
quantify the gap which would be needed to prove this equivalence, several
ballisticity conditions have been introduced. In particular, in 2001 and 2002,
Sznitman defined the so called conditions $(T)$ and $(T')$. The first one is
the requirement that certain unlikely exit probabilities from a set of slabs
decay exponentially fast with their width $L$. The second one is the
requirement that for all $\gamma\in (0,1)$ condition $(T)_\gamma$ is satisfied,
which in turn is defined as the requirement that the decay is like

setting of Boltzmann planar maps coupled to a rigid $O(n)$ loop model. Its law
is related to a class of discrete Markov processes obtained by confining random
walks to the positive integers with a new type of boundary condition. As an
application we give a rigorous justification of the phase diagram of the model
presented in arXiv:1106.0153. This entails two results pertaining to the
so-called fixed-point equation: the first asserts that any solution determines
a well-defined model, while the second result, contributed by Chen in the
appendix, establishes precise existence criteria.
  A scaling limit for the exploration process is identified in terms of a new
class of positive self-similar Markov processes, going under the name of
ricocheted stable processes. As an application we study distances on
loop-decorated maps arising from a particular first passage percolation process
on the maps. In the scaling limit these distances between the boundary and a
marked point are related to exponential integrals of certain L\'evy processes.
The distributions of the latter can be identified in a fairly explicit form
using machinery of positive self-similar Markov processes.
  Finally we observe a relation between the number of loops that surround a
marked vertex in a Boltzmann loop-decorated map and the winding angle of a
simple random walk on the square lattice. As a corollary we give a
combinatorial proof of the fact that the total winding angle around the origin
of a simple random walk started at $(p,p)$ and killed upon hitting $(0,0)$
normalized by $\log p$ converges in distribution to a Cauchy random variable.

information and communications technologies (ICTs) makes cyber-physical systems
vulnerable to targeted attacks that are deceptive, persistent, adaptive and
strategic. Attack instances such as Stuxnet, Dyn, and WannaCry ransomware have
shown the insufficiency of off-the-shelf defensive methods including the
firewall and intrusion detection systems. Hence, it is essential to design
up-to-date security mechanisms that can mitigate the risks despite the
successful infiltration and the strategic response of sophisticated attackers.
In this chapter, we use game theory to model competitive interactions between
defenders and attackers. First, we use the static Bayesian game to capture the
stealthy and deceptive characteristics of the attacker. A random variable
called the \textit{type} characterizes users' essences and objectives, e.g., a
legitimate user or an attacker. The realization of the user's type is private
information due to the cyber deception. Then, we extend the one-shot
simultaneous interaction into the one-shot interaction with asymmetric
information structure, i.e., the signaling game. Finally, we investigate the
multi-stage transition under a case study of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
and Tennessee Eastman (TE) process. Two-Sided incomplete information is
introduced because the defender can adopt defensive deception techniques such
as honey files and honeypots to create sufficient amount of uncertainties for
the attacker. Throughout this chapter, the analysis of the Nash equilibrium
(NE), Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE), and perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium
(PBNE) enables the policy prediction of the adversary and the design of
proactive and strategic defenses to deter attackers and mitigate losses.

describe the strongly-correlated physics of one-dimensional systems at low
temperatures. A hallmark signature in 1D conductors is the quantum phase
transition between metallic and insulating states induced by a single impurity.
However, this transition impedes experimental explorations of real-world TLLs.
Furthermore, its theoretical treatment, explaining the universal energy
rescaling of the conductance at low temperatures, has so far been achieved
exactly only for specific interaction strengths. Quantum simulation can provide
a powerful workaround. Here, a hybrid metal-semiconductor dissipative quantum
circuit is shown to implement the analogue of a TLL of adjustable electronic
interactions comprising a single, fully tunable scattering impurity.
Measurements reveal the renormalization group `beta-function' for the
conductance that completely determines the TLL universal crossover to an
insulating state upon cooling. Moreover, the characteristic scaling energy
locating at a given temperature the position within this conductance
renormalization flow is established over nine decades versus circuit
parameters, and the out-of-equilibrium regime is explored. With the quantum
simulator quality demonstrated from the precise parameter-free validation of
existing and novel TLL predictions, quantum simulation is achieved in a strong
sense, by elucidating interaction regimes which resist theoretical solutions.

with a magma ocean. From that moment, the mantle convective thermal flux
control the cooling of the planet and an atmosphere is created by outgassing.
This atmosphere will then play a key role during this cooling phase. Studying
this cooling phase in details is a necessary step to explain the great
diversity of the observed telluric planets and especially to assess the
presence of surface liquid water. We used here a radiative-convective 1D
atmospheric model (H2O, CO2) to study the impact of the Bond albedo on the
evolution of magma ocean planets. We derived from this model the thermal
emission spectrum and the spectral reflectance of these planets, from which we
calculated their Bond albedos. Compared to Marcq et al. (2017), the model now
includes a new module to compute the Rayleigh scattering, and state of the art
CO2 and H2O gaseous opacities data in the visible and infrared spectral ranges.
We show that the Bond albedo of these planets depends on their surface
temperature and results from a competition between Rayleigh scattering from the
gases and Mie scattering from the clouds. The colder the surface temperature
is, the thicker the clouds are, and the higher the Bond albedo is. We also
evidence that the relative abundances of CO2 and H2O in the atmosphere strongly
impact the Bond albedo. The Bond albedo is higher for atmospheres dominated by
the CO2, better Rayleigh scatterer than H2O. Finally, we provide the community
with an empirical formula for the Bond albedo that could be useful for future
studies of magma ocean planets.

a bridge between this and specific PDEs for observables $O$ in Physics. We
furthermore prove versions of four other theorems either side of this bridge:
the below enumerated sentences. For the generic geometry - in the sense of it
possessing no generalized Killing vectors, i.e.\ continuous geometrical
automorphisms - the $P$ form a smooth space of free functions over said
geometry. If a geometry possesses the corresponding type of Killing vectors,
the $P$ must Lie-brackets commute with `sums-over-points of the automorphism
generators', $S$. The observables counterpart of this is that in the presence
of first-class constraints $F$, the $O$ must Poisson-brackets commute with
these. Then 1) defining $Q$, $O$ requires closed subalgebras of $S$, $F$. 2)
The $Q$, and the $O$, themselves form closed algebras. 3) The subalgebras of
$Q$, $O$ form bounded lattices dual to those of $S$, $F$ respectively. Both
$S$, $Q$ and $F$, $O$ commutations can moreover be reformulated as first-order
linear PDEs, treated free-characteristically. The secondmost generic case has
just one $S$ or $F$, and so just one PDE, which standardly reduces to an ODE
system. The more highly nongeneric case of multiple $S$ or $F$, however,
returns an over-determined PDE system. 4) We prove that nonetheless these are
always integrable. This is significant by being mostly-opposite to how the more
familiar generalized Killing equations themselves behave. We finally solve for
the preserved quantities of similarity geometry and its subgroups; companion
papers extend this program to affine, projective and conformal geometries.

composition of the asteroid (121514) 1999 UJ7, the only currently known L4
Martian Trojan asteroid. Methods. We have obtained visible reflectance spectra
and photometry of 1999 UJ7 and compared the spectroscopic results with the
spectra of a number of taxonomic classes and subclasses. A light curve was
obtained and analysed to determine the asteroid spin state. Results. The
visible spectrum of 1999 UJ7 exhibits a negative slope in the blue region and
the presence of a wide and deep absorption feature centred around ~0.65
microns. The overall morphology of the spectrum seems to suggest a C-complex
taxonomy. The photometric behaviour is fairly complex. The light curve shows a
primary period of 1.936 d, but this is derived using only a subset of the
photometric data. The asteroid may be in a non-principal axis rotational state,
but our observational coverage is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions.
Conclusions. Although the observed spectral absorption is wider and deeper,
this finding may be compatible with the 0.7 microns spectral feature exhibited
by some Ch-type asteroids and could possibly be interpreted as diagnostic of
the presence of hydrated minerals. The inferred composition of 1999 UJ7 as a
primitive object can be consistent with a volatile-rich object originally
accreted beyond the snow line of the solar system and subsequently evolved to
reach the inner regions of the solar system.

states of a bosonic field, which outperforms the existing such measures in
several ways. We define for that purpose the operator ordering sensitivity of
the state which evaluates the sensitivity to operator ordering of the Renyi
entropy of its quasi-probabilities and which measures the oscillations in its
Wigner function. Through a sharp control on the operator ordering sensitivity
of classical states we obtain a precise geometric image of their location in
the density matrix space allowing us to introduce a distance-based measure of
nonclassicality. We analyse the link between this nonclassicality measure and a
recently introduced quantum macroscopicity measure, showing how the two notions
are distinct.

Cherenkov volumetric dosimetry improves the skewed percent depth dose
measurement. The aim of this study was to quantify the ability of quinine to
convert directional Cherenkov emission to isotropic fluorescence and evaluate
its contribution to the total emitted light. Aqueous solutions of quinine were
prepared with distilled water at various concentrations (0.01 to 1.2 g/L). The
solutions were irradiated with photon beams at 6 and 23 MV. The dependence of
the light produced as a function of sample concentration was studied using a
spectrometer with a fixed integration time. Spectral measurements of the
luminescent solution and the blank solution (distilled water only) were taken
to deconvolve the Cherenkov and quinine contribution to the overall emission
spectrum. Using a CCD camera, intensity profiles were obtained for the blank
and the 1.00 g/L solutions to compare them with the dose predicted by a
treatment planning system. The luminescent intensity of the samples was found
to follow a logarithmic trend as a function of the quinine concentration. Based
on the spectral deconvolution of the 1.00 g/L solution, 52.4% and 52.7% of the
signal in the visible range results from the quinine emission at 6 and 23 MV,
respectively. The remaining fraction of the spectrum is due to the Cherenkov
light that has not been converted. The fraction of the Cherenkov emission
produced between 250 nm and 380 nm in the water and that was absorbed by the
fluorophore reached 24.8% and 9.4% respectively at 6 and 23 MV. X-ray
stimulated fluorescence of the quinine was then proven to be the principal
cause to the increased total light output compared to the water-only signal.
This new information reinforces the direct correlation of the solution
intensity to the dose deposition.

indicating our motivation for this investigation in a wider context the first
major part of the paper is devoted to the derivation and analysis of a
posteriori error bounds that, under mild conditions on variable convection
fields, are efficient and, modulo a data-oscillation term, reliable. In

stays uniformly proportional to the problem size. The remaining part of the
paper is then concerned with the question whether typical bulk criteria known
from adaptive strategies for elliptic problems entail a fixed error reduction
rate also in the context of transport equations. This turns out to be
significantly more difficult than for elliptic problems and at this point we
can give a complete affirmative answer for a single spatial dimension. For the
general multidimensional case we provide partial results which we find of
interest in their own right. An essential distinction from known concepts is
that global arguments enter the issue of error reduction. An important
ingredient of the underlying analysis, which is perhaps interesting in its own
right, is to relate the derived error indicators to the residuals that
naturally arise in related least squares formulations. This reveals a close
interrelation between both settings regarding error reduction in the context of
adaptive refinements.

parameter choice is the quasi-optimality criterion where the parameter is
chosen as the global minimizer of the quasi-optimality function. In some
problems this rule fails. We prove that one of the local minimizers of the
quasi-optimality function is always a good regularization parameter. For choice
of the proper local minimizer we propose to construct the Q-curve which is the
analogue of the L-curve, but on x-axis we use modified discrepancy instead of
discrepancy and on the y-axis the quasi-optimality function instead of the norm
of the approximate solution. In area rule we choose for the regularization
parameter such local minimizer of the quasi-optimality function for which the
area of polygon, connecting on Q-curve this minimum point with certain maximum
points, is maximal. We also provide a posteriori error estimates of the
approximate solution, which allows to check the reliability of parameter chosen
heuristically. Numerical experiments on extensive set of test problems confirm
that the proposed rules give much better results than previous heuristic rules.
Results of proposed rules are comparable with results of the discrepancy
principle and the monotone error rule, if last two rules use the exact noise

on minimizing a non-convex quadratic functional, which will hence-forth be
termed as the \textit{Low-Rank-Functional} (LRF). Although this method lacks a
formal proof/comprehensive analysis, for example in terms of a probabilistic
guarantee for converging to a solution, the proposed idea is intuitive and has

important for training visual recognition systems. By artificially increasing
the number of training examples, it helps reducing overfitting and improves
generalization. While simple image transformations can already improve
predictive performance in most vision tasks, larger gains can be obtained by
leveraging task-specific prior knowledge. In this work, we consider object
detection, semantic and instance segmentation and augment the training images
by blending objects in existing scenes, using instance segmentation
annotations. We observe that randomly pasting objects on images hurts the
performance, unless the object is placed in the right context. To resolve this
issue, we propose an explicit context model by using a convolutional neural
network, which predicts whether an image region is suitable for placing a given
object or not. In our experiments, we show that our approach is able to improve
object detection, semantic and instance segmentation on the PASCAL VOC12 and
COCO datasets, with significant gains in a limited annotation scenario, i.e.
when only one category is annotated. We also show that the method is not
limited to datasets that come with expensive pixel-wise instance annotations
and can be used when only bounding boxes are available, by employing
weakly-supervised learning for instance masks approximation.

the complex dynamical networks of the brain to support coherent perception and

explain the emergence of GDSA from the brain's network structure and dynamics.
This part completes the development of HSR by deriving conditions on the joint
structure of the hierarchical subnetworks that guarantee top-down recruitment
of the task-relevant part of each subnetwork by the subnetwork at the layer
immediately above, while inhibiting the activity of task-irrelevant subnetworks
at all the hierarchical layers. To further verify the merit and applicability
of this framework, we carry out a comprehensive case study of selective
listening in rodents and show that a small network with HSR-based structure and
minimal size can explain the data with remarkable accuracy while satisfying the
theoretical requirements of HSR. Our technical approach relies on the theory of
switched systems and provides a novel converse Lyapunov theorem for
state-dependent switched affine systems that is of independent interest.

cross-sections of the eigenmodes of unstable canonical resonators were
predicted to be fractals [Karman et al., Nature 402, 138 (1999)]. Experimental

controlled generation of fractal light inside a laser cavity. We also advance
the existing theory of fractal laser modes, first by predicting 3D self-similar

second by showing, quantitatively, that intensity cross-sections are most
self-similar in the magnified self-conjugate plane. Our work offers a

finite union-closed family of finite sets, other than the family consisting
only of the empty set, there exists an element that belongs to at least half of
the sets in the family. In [3], a stronger version of Frankl's conjecture
(S-Frankl conjecture for short) was introduced and a partial proof was given.
In particular, it was proved in \cite{CH17} that S-Frankl conjecture holds when
$n\leq 5$, where $n$ is the number of all the elements in the family of sets.
Now, we want to prove that it holds when $n=6$. Since the paper is very long,
we split it into two parts. This is the first part.

degrees of freedom and accounting for the statistical interpretation of Rindler
horizons, the freedom to construct quantum gravity theories reproducing General
Relativity and Quantum Field Theory (QFT) as special cases is considerably
reduced. On one hand, the mathematical structure of quantum gravity is
restricted by the properties of Quantum Mechanics. On the other hand, one can
predict a value for the fundamental quantum constant of gravity which is
related to the Planck area via the Planck constant. These findings are
compatible with spin-less particles of matter. In the context of canonical
ensemble statistics, the von Neumann entropy concept is found to extend from
matter to gravity. An important motivation and pillar for this development is
the concept of multiple observer statistics and the total entropy perceived by
Rindler observers with a particular spacing, which has a one-to-one
correspondence to the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term.

This work is devoted to the generalization of the Balanced Phase Field Model
for Active Contours devised to eliminate the often undesirable
curvature-dependent shrinking of the zero level set while maintaining the
smooth interface necessary to calculate the fundamental geometric quantities of
the represented contour. As its antecedent work, the proposed model extends the
Ginzburg-Landau phase field energy with a higher order smoothness term. The
relative weights are determined with the analysis of the level set motion in a
curvilinear system adapted to the zero level set. The proposed model exhibits
strong shape maintaining capability without significant interference with the
active (e.g. a segmentation) model.

fixed set search (FSS). The proposed approach represents a method of adding a
learning mechanism to the greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP).
The basic concept of FSS is to avoid focusing on specific high quality
solutions but on parts or elements that such solutions have. This is done
through fixing a set of elements that exist in such solutions and dedicating
computational effort to finding near optimal solutions for the underlying
subproblem. The simplicity of implementing the proposed method is illustrated
on the traveling salesman problem. Our computational experiments show that the
FSS manages to find significantly better solutions than the GRASP it is based
on and also the dynamic convexized method.

many contemporary big data applications arising in economics and finance. While
the former is enjoyed to some extent by many existing forecasting approaches,
the latter in the sense of controlling the fraction of wrongly discovered
features which can enhance greatly the interpretability is still largely
underdeveloped in the econometric settings. To this end, in this paper we
exploit the general framework of model-X knockoffs introduced recently in
Cand\`{e}s, Fan, Janson and Lv (2018), which is nonconventional for
reproducible large-scale inference in that the framework is completely free of
the use of p-values for significance testing, and suggest a new method of
intertwined probabilistic factors decoupling (IPAD) for stable interpretable
forecasting with knockoffs inference in high-dimensional models. The recipe of
the method is constructing the knockoff variables by assuming a latent factor
model that is exploited widely in economics and finance for the association
structure of covariates. Our method and work are distinct from the existing
literature in that we estimate the covariate distribution from data instead of
assuming that it is known when constructing the knockoff variables, our
procedure does not require any sample splitting, we provide theoretical
justifications on the asymptotic false discovery rate control, and the theory
for the power analysis is also established. Several simulation examples and the
real data analysis further demonstrate that the newly suggested method has
appealing finite-sample performance with desired interpretability and stability
compared to some popularly used forecasting methods.

of Super-Resolution Perception (SRP) on industrial sensor data. Industrial
intelligence relies on high-quality industrial sensor data for system control,
diagnosis, fault detection, identification, and monitoring. However, the
provision of high-quality data may be expensive in some cases. In this paper,
we propose a novel machine learning problem -- the SRP problem as
reconstructing high-quality data from unsatisfactory sensor data in industrial
systems. Advanced generative models are then proposed to solve the SRP problem.
This technology makes it possible to empower existing industrial facilities
without upgrading existing sensors or deploying additional sensors. We first
mathematically formulate the SRP problem under the Maximum a Posteriori (MAP)
estimation framework. A case study is then presented, which performs SRP on
smart meter data. A network, namely SRPNet, is proposed to generate
high-frequency load data from low-frequency data. We further employ a novel
recognition-based loss and relativistic adversarial loss to constraint the
reconstruction of waveforms explicitly. Experiments demonstrate that our SRP
model can reconstruct high-frequency data effectively. Moreover, the
reconstructed high-frequency data can lead to better appliance monitoring
results without changing the monitoring appliances.

demonstrate an effective doping scheme using nickel to reduce the resistivity
contrast between the amorphous and crystalline states by nearly three orders of
magnitude. Most importantly, our results show that doping produces the desired
electrical performance without adversely affecting the film's optical
properties. The nickel doping level is approximately 2% and the lattice
structure remains nearly unchanged when compared with undoped-GST. The
refractive indices at amorphous and crystalline states were obtained using
ellipsometry which echoes the results from XRD. The material's thermal
transport properties are measured using time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR),
showing no change upon doping. The advantages of this doping system will open
up new opportunities for designing electrically reconfigurable high speed
optical elements in the near-infrared spectrum.

the uranium enrichment and the volume fraction of BeO in the UO2-BeO fuel. The
uranium enrichment is determined to ensure the same cycle length for each BeO
fraction with zircaloy, FeCrAl, and SiC claddings. Similar neutronic properties
are observed between the zircaloy and SiC claddings for a given BeO fraction,
including the infinite multiplication factor, the gas release, the power
distribution, and the isotopic concentrations. An important feature of UO2-BeO
fuel is the production of 4He, which is significant compared with current UO2
fuel. Lower production rates of xenon and krypton are found in the case of the
UO2-BeO-FeCrAl fuel-cladding system, while those in the UO2-BeO-zircaloy and
UO2-BeO-SiC systems are quite similar to the current UO2-zircaloy system. The
power distribution in an assembly and in a fuel pellet is flatter for a higher
BeO fraction with the same cladding. Higher peak power is found in fuel
assemblies with FeCrAl compared to the other two claddings, while the radial
power distribution is quite similar for the three claddings.
