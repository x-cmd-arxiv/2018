Theory. Volume: 64, Issue: 1, 2018] the maximum number of bent components of
vectorial function. They have presented serval nice results and suggested
several open problems in this context. This paper is in the continuation of
their study in which we solve two open problems raised by Pott et al. and
partially solve an open problem raised by the same authors. Firstly, we prove
that for a vectorial function, the property of having the maximum number of
bent components is invariant under the so-called CCZ equivalence. Secondly, we
prove the non-existence of APN plateaued having the maximum number of bent
components. In particular, quadratic APN functions cannot have the maximum
number of bent components. Finally, we present some sufficient conditions that
the vectorial function defined from $\mathbb{F}_{2^{2k}}$ to
$\mathbb{F}_{2^{2k}}$ by its univariate representation:
  $$ \alpha
x^{2^i}\left(x+x^{2^k}+\sum\limits_{j=1}^{\rho}\gamma^{(j)}x^{2^{t_j}}
  +\sum\limits_{j=1}^{\rho}\gamma^{(j)}x^{2^{t_j+k}}\right)$$ has the maximum
number of {components bent functions, where $\rho\leq k$}. Further, we show
that the differential spectrum of the function $
x^{2^i}(x+x^{2^k}+x^{2^{t_1}}+x^{2^{t_1+k}}+x^{2^{t_2}}+x^{2^{t_2+k}})$ (where
$i,t_1,t_2$ satisfy some conditions) is different from the binomial function
$F^i(x)= x^{2^i}(x+x^{2^k})$ presented in the article of Pott et al.
  Finally, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions so that the functions
$$Tr_1^{2k}\left(\alpha
x^{2^i}\left(Tr^{2k}_{e}(x)+\sum\limits_{j=1}^{\rho}\gamma^{(j)}(Tr^{2k}_{e}(x))^{2^j}

modality for visualizing light absorbing structures in biological tissue. The
recently invented PAT systems using arrays of 64 parallel integrating line
detectors allow capturing photoacoustic projection images in fractions of a
second. Standard image formation algorithms for this type of setup suffer from
under-sampling due to the sparse detector array, blurring due to the finite
impulse response of the detection system, and artifacts due to the limited
detection view. To address these issues, in this paper we develop a new direct
and non-iterative image reconstruction framework using deep learning. The
proposed DALnet combines the universal backprojection (UBP) using dynamic
aperture length (DAL) correction with a deep convolutional neural network
(CNN). Both subnetworks contain free parameters that are adjusted in the
training phase. As demonstrated by simulation and experiment, the DALnet is
capable of producing high-resolution projection images of 3D structures at a
frame rate of over 50 images per second on a standard PC with NVIDIA TITAN Xp
GPU. The proposed network is shown to outperform state-of-the-art iterative
total variation reconstruction algorithms in terms of reconstruction speed as
well as in terms of various evaluation metrics.

that can be symmetric or asymmetric, ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic,
including off-diagonal disorder, are studied, for the number of states $q=3,4$
in $d$ dimensions. We use renormalization-group theory that is exact for
hierarchical lattices and approximate (Migdal-Kadanoff) for hypercubic
lattices. For all d>1 and all non-infinite temperatures, the system eventually
renormalizes to a random single state, thus signaling qxq degenerate ordering.
Note that this is the maximally degenerate ordering. For high-temperature
initial conditions, the system crosses over to this highly degenerate ordering
only after spending many renormalization-group iterations near the disordered
(infinite-temperature) fixed point. Thus, a temperature range of short-range
disorder in the presence of long-range order is identified, as previously seen
in underfrustrated Ising spin-glass systems. The entropy is calculated for all
temperatures, behaves similarly for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic
interactions, and shows a derivative maximum at the short-range disordering
temperature. With a sharp immediate contrast of infinitesimally higher
dimension 1+\epsilon, the system is as expected disordered at all temperatures
for d=1.

and pod storage assignment problems by evaluating multiple decision rules per
problem. The discrete event simulation uses realistic robot movements and keeps
track of every unit of inventory on every pod. We analyze seven performance
measures, e.g. throughput capacity and order due time, and find that the unit
throughput is strongly correlated with the other performance measures. We vary
the number of robots, the number of pick stations, the number of SKUs (stock
keeping units), the order size and whether returns need processing or not. The
decision rules for pick order assignment have a strong impact on the unit
throughput rate. This is not the case for replenishment order assignment, pod
selection and pod storage. Furthermore, for warehouses with a large number of
SKUs, more robots are needed for a high unit throughput rate, even if the
number of pods and the dimensions of the storage area remain the same. Lastly,
processing return orders only affects the unit throughput rate for warehouse
with a large number of SKUs and large pick orders.

between luminosity bursts \Delta\tau_mod, caused by dense clumps spiralling on
the protostar, with the differences of dynamical timescales between the knots
\Delta\tau_obs in CARMA 7. We found that the time spacing between the bursts
have a bi-modal distribution caused by isolated and clustered luminosity
bursts. The former are characterized by long quiescent periods between the
bursts with \Delta\tau_mod = a few * (10^3-10^4) yr, whereas the latter occur
in small groups with time spacing between the bursts \Delta\tau_mod= a few *
(10-10^2) yr. For the clustered bursts, the distribution of \Delta\tau_mod in
our models can be fit reasonably well to the distribution of \Delta\tau_obs in
the protostellar jet of CARMA 7, if a certain correction for the (yet unknown)
inclination angle with respect to the line of sight is applied. The K-S test on

characterizing habitable planets in the solar neighborhood. However, the
ultraviolet (UV) radiation emitted by such stars can erode and modify planetary
atmospheres over time, drastically affecting their habitability. Thus knowledge
of the UV evolution of low-mass stars is critical for interpreting the
evolutionary history of any orbiting planets. Shkolnik & Barman (2014) used
photometry from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) to show how UV emission
evolves for early type M stars ($>$0.35 $M_\odot$). In this paper, we extend
their work to include both a larger sample of low-mass stars with known ages as
well as M stars with lower masses. We find clear evidence that mid- and
late-type M stars (0.08-0.35 $M_\odot$) do not follow the same UV evolutionary

field ages, with only a factor of 4 decrease on average in GALEX NUV and FUV
flux density between young ($<$50 Myr) and old ($\sim$5 Gyr) stars, compared to
a factor of 11 and 31 for early-Ms in NUV and FUV, respectively. We also find
that the FUV/NUV flux density ratio, which can affect the photochemistry of
important planetary biosignatures, is mass and age-dependent for early Ms, but
remains relatively constant for the mid- and late-type Ms in our sample.

7885570 and its chromospheric activity based on the Kepler Mission data.
Assuming the primary component temperature, 6530 K, the temperature of the
secondary component was found to be 5732+-4 K. The mass ratio of the components
(q) was found to be 0.43$\pm$0.01, while the inclination ($i$) of the system
80.56+-0.01 deg. Additionally, the data were separated into 35 subsets to model
the sinusoidal variation due to the rotational modulation, using the SPOTMODEL
program, as the light curve analysis indicated the chromospherically active
secondary component. It was found that there are generally two spotted areas,
whose radii, longitudes and latitudes are rapidly changing, located around the
latitudes of +50 deg and +90 deg on the active component. Moreover, 113 flares
were detected and their parameters were computed from the available data. The
One Phase Exponential Association function model was derived from the
parameters of these flares. Using the regression calculations, the Plateau
value was found to be 1.9815+-0.1177, while the half-life value was computed as
3977.2 s. In addition, the flare frequency (N1) - the flare number per hour,
was estimated to be 0.00362 1/h, while flare frequency (N2) - the
flare-equivalent duration emitted per hour, was computed as 0.00001. Finally,
the times of eclipses were computed for 278 minima of the light curves, whose
analysis indicated that the chromosphere activity nature of the system causes
some effects on these minima times. Comparing the chromospheric activity
patterns with the analogues of the secondary component, it is seen that the
magnetic activity level is remarkably low. However, it is still at the expected
level according to the B-V color index of 0.643 mag for the secondary
component.

star X-ray binaries has been mounting, from optical/infrared spectral,
polarimetric, and fast timing signatures. The synchrotron emission of jets can
be highly linearly polarised, depending on the configuration of the magnetic
field. Optical and infrared (OIR) polarimetric observations of X-ray binaries
are presented in this brief review. The OIR polarimetric signature of
relativistic jets is detected at levels of ~ 1-10 %, similar to AGN cores. This
reveals that the magnetic geometry in the compact jets may be similar for
supermassive and stellar-mass BHs. The magnetic fields near the jet base in
most of these systems appear to be turbulent, variable and on average, aligned
with the jet axis, although there are some exceptions. These measurements probe
the physical conditions in the accretion (out)flow and demonstrate a new way of
connecting inflow and outflow, using both rapid timing and polarisation.
Variations in polarisation could be due to rapid changes of the ordering of the
magnetic field in the emitting region, or in one case, flares from individual
ejections or collisions between ejecta. It is predicted that in some cases,
variable levels of X-ray polarisation from synchrotron emission originating in
jets will be detected from accreting Galactic black holes with upcoming
spaceborne X-ray polarimeters.

often more practical to use metadata such as the title of a publication instead
of the full-text or the abstract. Therefore, it is desirable to have good text
mining and text classification algorithms that operate well already on the
title of a publication. So far, the classification performance on titles is not
competitive with the performance on the full-texts if the same number of
training samples is used for training. However, it is much easier to obtain
title data in large quantities and to use it for training than full-text data.
In this paper, we investigate the question how models obtained from training on
increasing amounts of title training data compare to models from training on a
constant number of full-texts. We evaluate this question on a large-scale
dataset from the medical domain (PubMed) and from economics (EconBiz). In these
datasets, the titles and annotations of millions of publications are available,
and they outnumber the available full-texts by a factor of 20 and 15,
respectively. To exploit these large amounts of data to their full potential,
we develop three strong deep learning classifiers and evaluate their
performance on the two datasets. The results are promising. On the EconBiz
dataset, all three classifiers outperform their full-text counterparts by a
large margin. The best title-based classifier outperforms the best full-text
method by 9.4%. On the PubMed dataset, the best title-based method almost
reaches the performance of the best full-text classifier, with a difference of

analog signal involves conversion of this information to bits. This conversion
can be described by the combined effect of sampling and quantization, as
illustrated in Fig. 1. The digital representation is achieved by first sampling
the analog signal so as to represent it by a set of discrete-time samples and
then quantizing these samples to a finite number of bits. Traditionally, these
two operations are considered separately. The sampler is designed to minimize
information loss due to sampling based on characteristics of the
continuous-time input. The quantizer is designed to represent the samples as
accurately as possible, subject to a constraint on the number of bits that can
be used in the representation. The goal of this article is to revisit this
paradigm by illuminating the dependency between these two operations. In
particular, we explore the requirements on the sampling system subject to
constraints on the available number of bits for storing, communicating or
processing the analog information.

the thermal bath heats up our MJ and decreases electronic current. On the other

evidence that it will deliver the much-anticipated high density and access
latencies within only a few factors of DRAM. Nevertheless, the
latency-sensitive nature of memory-resident services makes seamless integration
of SCM in servers questionable. In this paper, we ask the question of how best
to introduce SCM for such servers to improve overall performance/cost over
existing DRAM-only architectures. We first show that even with the most
optimistic latency projections for SCM, the higher memory access latency
results in prohibitive performance degradation. However, we find that
deployment of a modestly sized high-bandwidth 3D stacked DRAM cache makes the
performance of an SCM-mostly memory system competitive. The high degree of
spatial locality that memory-resident services exhibit not only simplifies the
DRAM cache's design as page-based, but also enables the amortization of
increased SCM access latencies and the mitigation of SCM's read/write latency
disparity.
  We identify the set of memory hierarchy design parameters that plays a key
role in the performance and cost of a memory system combining an SCM technology
and a 3D stacked DRAM cache. We then introduce a methodology to drive
provisioning for each of these design parameters under a target
performance/cost goal. Finally, we use our methodology to derive concrete
results for specific SCM technologies. With PCM as a case study, we show that a
two bits/cell technology hits the performance/cost sweet spot, reducing the
memory subsystem cost by 40% while keeping performance within 3% of the best
performing DRAM-only system, whereas single-level and triple-level cell
organizations are impractical for use as memory replacements.

However, a good detection method should also be applicable to low resolution
images because compressed or resized images are common these days. To this end,
we propose a Shallow Convolutional Neural Network(SCNN), capable of
distinguishing the boundaries of forged regions from original edges in low
resolution images. SCNN is designed to utilize the information of chroma and
saturation. Based on SCNN, two approaches that are named Sliding Windows

localize image forgery region. In this paper, we substantiate that Fast SCNN
can detect drastic change of chroma and saturation. In image forgery detection

that Fast SCNN performs well on low resolution images and achieves significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art.

autonomous driving tasks, many in an end-to-end manner. Previous end-to-end
steering control methods take an image or an image sequence as the input and
directly predict the steering angle with CNN. Although single task learning on
steering angles has reported good performances, the steering angle alone is not
sufficient for vehicle control. In this work, we propose a multi-task learning
framework to predict the steering angle and speed control simultaneously in an
end-to-end manner. Since it is nontrivial to predict accurate speed values with
only visual inputs, we first propose a network to predict discrete speed
commands and steering angles with image sequences. Moreover, we propose a
multi-modal multi-task network to predict speed values and steering angles by
taking previous feedback speeds and visual recordings as inputs. Experiments
are conducted on the public Udacity dataset and a newly collected SAIC dataset.
Results show that the proposed model predicts steering angles and speed values
accurately. Furthermore, we improve the failure data synthesis methods to solve

digital image processing, digital and wireless communications, cryptography and
many other areas of computer science and coding theory. The practical benefits
of using orthogonal matrices come from the fact that the computation of inverse
matrices is avoided, by simply using the transpose of the orthogonal matrix. In
this paper, we introduce a new family of matrices over finite fields that we
call \emph{Quasi-Binary and Quasi-Orthogonal Matrices}. We call the matrices
quasi-binary due to the fact that matrices have only two elements $a, b \in
\mathbb{F}_q$, but those elements are not $0$ and $1$. In addition, the reason
why we call them quasi-orthogonal is due to the fact that their inverses are
obtained not just by a simple transposition, but there is a need for an
additional operation: a replacement of $a$ and $b$ by two other values $c$ and
$d$. We give a simple relation between the values $a, b, c$ and $d$ for any
finite field and especially for finite fields with characteristic 2. Our
construction is based on incident matrices from cyclic Latin Rectangles and the
efficiency of the proposed algorithm comes from the avoidance of matrix-matrix
or matrix-vector multiplications.

setting using Kelly's celebrated expected logarithmic growth criterion as the
performance metric. The game is defined by a sequence of bets with independent

wealth K wagered at k = 0 and waits n steps before updating the bet size.
Between updates, the proceeds from the previous bets remain at risk in the
spirit of ""buy and hold."" Within this context, the main questions we consider
are as follows: How does the optimal performance, we call it gn*, change with
n? Does the high-frequency case, n = 1, always lead to the best performance?
What are the effects of accrued interest and transaction costs? First, we
provide rather complete answers to these questions for the important special
case when X(k) in {-1,1} is a Bernoulli random variable with probability p that
X(k) = 1. This serves as an entry point for future research using a binomial
lattice model for stock trading. The latter sections focus on more general
probability distributions for X(k) and two conjectures. The first conjecture is
simple to state: Absent transaction costs, gn* is non-increasing in n. The
second conjecture involves the technical condition which we call the sufficient
attractiveness inequality. We first prove that satisfaction of this inequality
is sufficient to guarantee that the low-frequency bettor using large n can
match the performance of the high-frequency bettor using n = 1. Subsequently,
we conjecture, and provide supporting evidence that this condition is also
necessary.

However, due to the expensive manual process for labelling large number of
images, the amount of available training data is always limited. To produce
more data for training a deep network, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) can
be used to generate artificial sample data. However, the generated data usually
does not have annotation labels. To solve this problem, in this paper, we
propose a virtual label called Multi-pseudo Regularized Label (MpRL) and assign
it to the generated data. With MpRL, the generated data will be used as the
supplementary of real training data to train a deep neural network in a
semi-supervised learning fashion. To build the corresponding relationship
between the real data and generated data, MpRL assigns each generated data a
proper virtual label which reflects the likelihood of the affiliation of the
generated data to pre-defined training classes in the real data domain. Unlike
the traditional label which usually is a single integral number, the virtual
label proposed in this work is a set of weight-based values each individual of
which is a number in (0,1] called multi-pseudo label and reflects the degree of
relation between each generated data to every pre-defined class of real data. A
comprehensive evaluation is carried out by adopting two state-of-the-art
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in our experiments to verify the
effectiveness of MpRL. Experiments demonstrate that by assigning MpRL to
generated data, we can further improve the person re-ID performance on five
re-ID datasets, i.e., Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, CUHK03, VIPeR, and CUHK01.
The proposed method obtains +6.29%, +6.30%, +5.58%, +5.84%, and +3.48%
improvements in rank-1 accuracy over a strong CNN baseline on the five datasets
respectively, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

phases such as stream gravel beds, cracked soils and wetlands is affected by
processes such as attachment-detachment, gravity and drag, and by mixing
processes that are induced by Taylor dispersion and mechanical dispersion. This
paper addresses an additional dispersion mechanism which is induced by
gravitational settling and is a result of the coupling between the modified
particle concentration (the change of particle number density due to settling)
and the lateral velocity profiles at the subscale. Heavy particles that move in
areas of low horizontal velocity (e.g., near solid surfaces and wake regions)
settle closer to the release source as compared to particles in high velocity
regions. The macroscopic concentration field of such suspensions is influenced
by the ratio between the settling velocity and the subscale distribution of the
horizontal velocities. The objective of the study is to isolate and quantify
this type of dispersion using controlled flow scenarios. We used a Taylor brush
geometry (an array of vertical grooves) to numerically solve the flow.
Particles were released from a vertical plane, generating a constant flux. The
subscale Eulerian concentration was compiled from simulated trajectories and
then spatially averaged to generate macroscopic concentration fields. The
results show that this settling-induced dispersion is significant in regions
near the source and that it cannot be modeled using Fick's law type of
formulations. A parametric investigation shows that the location of the highest
dispersion flux is linearly proportional to both the groove spacing and depth.
A proposed model that estimates this location is used to evaluate where
settling-induced dispersion should not be ignored.

constants. In an important particular case when semigroups are holomorphic, we
are able to significantly improve our results for general semigroups. Moreover,
we present several second order approximation formulas with rates, which in
such a general form appear in the literature for the first time.

follow logic-based reasoning. Yet, practical data cleaning tools need to
incorporate statistical reasoning to be effective in real-world data cleaning
tasks. Motivated by these empirical successes, we propose a formal framework
for unclean databases, where two types of statistical knowledge are
incorporated: The first represents a belief of how intended (clean) data is
generated, and the second represents a belief of how noise is introduced in the
actual observed database instance. To capture this noisy channel model, we
introduce the concept of a Probabilistic Unclean Database (PUD), a triple that
consists of a probabilistic database that we call the intention, a
probabilistic data transformator that we call the realization and captures how
noise is introduced, and a dirty observed database instance that we call the
observation. We define three computational problems in the PUD framework:
cleaning (infer the most probable clean instance given a PUD), probabilistic
query answering (compute the probability of an answer tuple over the unclean
observed instance), and learning (estimate the most likely intention and
realization models of a PUD given a collection of training data). We illustrate
the PUD framework on concrete representations of the intention and realization,
show that they generalize traditional concepts of repairs such as cardinality
and value repairs, draw connection to consistent query answering, and prove
tractability results. We further show that parameters can be learned in
practical instantiations, and in fact, prove that under certain conditions we
can learn a PUD directly from a single dirty database instance without any need
for clean examples.

  Two-stage Adjustable Robust Optimization",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of designing piecewise affine policies for two-stage
adjustable robust linear optimization problems under right-hand side
uncertainty. It is well known that a piecewise affine policy is optimal
although the number of pieces can be exponentially large. A significant
challenge in designing a practical piecewise affine policy is constructing good
pieces of the uncertainty set. Here we address this challenge by introducing a
new framework in which the uncertainty set is ""approximated"" by a ""dominating""
simplex. The corresponding policy is then based on a mapping from the
uncertainty set to the simplex. Although our piecewise affine policy has
exponentially many pieces, it can be computed efficiently by solving a compact
linear program given the dominating simplex. Furthermore, we can find the
dominating simplex in a closed form if the uncertainty set satisfies some
symmetries and can be computed using a MIP in general. The performance of our
policy is significantly better than the affine policy for many important
uncertainty sets, such as ellipsoids and norm-balls, both theoretically and
numerically. For instance, for hypersphere uncertainty set, our piecewise
affine policy can be computed by an LP and gives a $O(m^{1/4})$-approximation
whereas the affine policy requires us to solve a second order cone program and
has a worst-case performance bound of $O(\sqrt m)$.

  Sinusoid Wave for Classification via the Fast Fourier Transform",,,,,"q-bio.QM q-bio.TO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  There is no method to quantify the spatial complexity within colon polyps.
This paper describes a spatial transformation that translates the tissue
architecture within a polyp, or a normal colon lining, into a complex sinusoid
wave composed of discrete points. This sinusoid wave can then undergo the Fast
Fourier Transform to obtain a spectrum of frequencies that represents the
sinusoid wave. This spectrum can then serve as a signature of the spatial
complexity [an index] within the polyp. By overlaying vertical lines that
radiate from the bottom middle [like a fold-out fan] of an image of a polyp
stained by hematoxylin and eosin, the image is segmented into sectors. Each
vertical line also forms an angle with the horizontal axis of the image,
ranging from 0 degrees to 180 degrees rising counter clockwise. Each vertical
line will intersect with various features of the polyp [border of lumens,
border of epithelial lining]. Each of these intersections is a point that can
be characterized by its distance from the origin [this distance is also a
magnitude of that point]. Thus, each intersection between radial line and polyp
feature can be mapped by polar coordinates [radius length, angle measure]. By
summing the distance of all points along the same radial line, each radial line
that divides the image becomes one value. Plotting these values [y variable]
against the angle of each radial line from the horizontal axis [x variable]
results in a sinusoid wave consisting of discrete points. This method is
referred to as the Linearized Compressed Polar Coordinates [LCPC] Transform.
The LCPC transform, in conjunction with the Fast Fourier Transform, can reduce
the complexity of visually hidden histological grades in colon polyps into
categories of similar wave frequencies [each histological grade has a signature
consisting of a handful of frequencies].

existing DNN-based methods solve the IR problems by directly mapping low
quality images to desirable high-quality images, the observation models
characterizing the image degradation processes have been largely ignored. In
this paper, we first propose a denoising-based IR algorithm, whose iterative
steps can be computed efficiently. Then, the iterative process is unfolded into
a deep neural network, which is composed of multiple denoisers modules
interleaved with back-projection (BP) modules that ensure the observation
consistencies. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based denoiser that can
exploit the multi-scale redundancies of natural images is proposed. As such,
the proposed network not only exploits the powerful denoising ability of DNNs,
but also leverages the prior of the observation model. Through end-to-end
training, both the denoisers and the BP modules can be jointly optimized.
Experimental results on several IR tasks, e.g., image denoisig,
super-resolution and deblurring show that the proposed method can lead to very
competitive and often state-of-the-art results on several IR tasks, including
image denoising, deblurring and super-resolution.

$\mathbb{Z}_2$-additions in a given simplicial complex $\mathcal{K}$ has been
researched actively in recent years. When the complex $\mathcal{K}$ is a
weighted graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, the problem of computing a
shortest (homology) cycle basis is known to be solvable in $O(m^2n/\log n+
n^2m)$-time. Several works \cite{borradaile2017minimum, greedy} have addressed
the case when the complex $\mathcal{K}$ is a $2$-manifold. The complexity of
these algorithms depends on the rank $g$ of the one-dimensional homology group
of $\mathcal{K}$. This rank $g$ has a lower bound of $\Theta(n)$, where $n$
denotes the number of simplices in $\mathcal{K}$, giving an $O(n^4)$ worst-case
time complexity for the algorithms in \cite{borradaile2017minimum,greedy}. This
worst-case complexity is improved in \cite{annotation} to $O(n^\omega +
n^2g^{\omega-1})$ for general simplicial complexes where $\omega< 2.3728639$
\cite{le2014powers} is the matrix multiplication exponent. Taking
$g=\Theta(n)$, this provides an $O(n^{\omega+1})$ worst-case algorithm. In this
paper, we improve this time complexity. Combining the divide and conquer
technique from \cite{DivideConquer} with the use of annotations from
\cite{annotation}, we present an algorithm that runs in $O(n^\omega+n^2g)$ time
giving the first $O(n^3)$ worst-case algorithm for general complexes. If
instead of minimal basis, we settle for an approximate basis, we can improve
the running time even further. We show that a $2$-approximate minimal homology
basis can be computed in $O(n^{\omega}\sqrt{n \log n})$ expected time. We also
study more general measures for defining the minimal basis and identify
reasonable conditions on these measures that allow computing a minimal basis
efficiently.

particularly in the single class known by allowing at least a Killing symmetry:
the AdS waves. They have the advantage of being represented by a generalized
Kerr-Schild transformation from AdS spacetime. This means a notorious
simplification in bigravity by allowing to straightforwardly compute any power
of its interaction square root matrix, opening the door to explore physically
meaningful exact configurations. For these exact gravitational waves the
complex dynamical structure of bigravity decomposes into elementary exact
massless or massive excitations propagating on AdS. We use a complexified
formulation of the Euler-Darboux equations to provide for the first time the
general solutions to the massive version of the Siklos equation which rules the
resulting AdS-waves dynamics, using an integral representation originally due
to Poisson. Inspired in this progress we tackle the subtle problem on how
matter couples to bigravity and concretely if this occurs through a composite
metric, which is hard to handle in a general setting. Surprisingly, the
Kerr-Schild ansatz brings again a huge simplification in how the related
energy-momentum tensors are calculated. This allows us to explicitly
characterize AdS waves supported in one case by a massless free scalar field
and by a wavefront-homogeneous Maxwell field in another. Considering the most
general allowed Maxwell source instead is a highly nontrivial task, that we
accomplish by exploiting again the complexified Euler-Darboux description and
taking advantage of the classical Riemann method. In fact, this allow us to
find at the end the most general configurations for any matter source.

long time. In this paper, a novel convolutional neural network based on wavelet
and dark channel is proposed. On one hand, we think that rain streaks
correspond to high frequency component of the image. Therefore, haar wavelet
transform is a good choice to separate the rain streaks and background to some
extent. More specifically, the LL subband of a rain image is more inclined to
express the background information, while LH, HL, HH subband tend to represent
the rain streaks and the edges. On the other hand, the accumulation of rain
streaks from long distance makes the rain image look like haze veil. We extract
dark channel of rain image as a feature map in network. By increasing this
mapping between the dark channel of input and output images, we achieve haze
removal in an indirect way. All of the parameters are optimized by
back-propagation. Experiments on both synthetic and real- world datasets reveal
that our method outperforms other state-of- the-art methods from a qualitative

means for payment, because their prices tend to go up in the long term (thus

the short term (thus people would want to avoid risks of losing values). The
reason why those blockchain currencies based on proof of work are unstable may
be found in their designs that the supplies of currencies do not respond to
their positive and negative demand shocks, as the authors have formulated in
our past work. Continuing from our past work, this paper proposes minimal
changes to the design of blockchain currencies so that their market prices are
automatically stabilized, absorbing both positive and negative demand shocks of
the currencies by autonomously controlling their supplies. Those changes are:
1) limiting re-adjustment of proof-of-work targets, 2) making mining rewards
variable according to the observed over-threshold changes of block intervals,
and 3) enforcing negative interests to remove old coins in circulation. We have
made basic design checks and evaluations of these measures through simple

have effects of making those currencies preferred means for payment by
disincentivizing hoarding, and improving sustainability of the currency systems
by making rewards to miners perpetual.

study the atomic structure of Puiseux algebras. To begin with, we answer the
Isomorphism Problem for the class of Puiseux algebras, that is, we show that
for a field $F$ if two Puiseux algebras $F[M_1]$ and $F[M_2]$ are isomorphic,
then the monoids $M_1$ and $M_2$ must be isomorphic. Then we construct three

finite factorization property. We show that there are bounded factorization
Puiseux algebras with extremal systems of sets of lengths, which allows us to
prove that Puiseux algebras cannot be determined up to isomorphism by their
arithmetic of lengths. Finally, we give a full description of the seminormal
closure, root closure, and complete integral closure of a Puiseux algebra, and

  spanner","28 pages, 6 figures",,,,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Based on the analyses of the wave front and the wave vector of an
acoustic-vortex (AV) spanner generated by a circular array of point source, the
principle of object rotation is investigated through the calculation of the
orbital angular momentum (OAM) and the radiation torque for AVs with various
topological charges. It is demonstrated theoretically that the rotation of the
axisymmetric disk centered on an AV spanner is mainly driven by the exerted
radiation torque without the contribution of the OAM transfer. The radiation
torque on a small-radius object is inversely associated with the topological
charge in the center of the AV spanner, and it is enhanced significantly for a
larger AV with a higher topological charge. The special case of the radiation
torque proportional to the topological charge might be realized when the disk
radius is much larger than the wavelength, in which case the acoustic power of
the AV spanner can be absorbed as much as possible. With the established
sixteen-source experimental setup, the radial pressure distributions of AVs
with different topological charges measured at the frequency of 1.3 kHz in air
agree well with the simulations. The topological-charge dependence of the
radiation torque for AVs is also verified by the quantitative
laser-displacement (angle) measurements for disks with different radii. The
favorable results demonstrate that, for the object covering the vortex center
of an AV spanner, the total OAM transfer might be 0 and the object rotation is
contributed by the acting moments. Thus, the radiation torque of an AV spanner
is more applicable than the OAM for describing the driving capability of object
rotation, and it can be used as an effective tool in clinical applications to
noninvasively manipulate objects with a feature size at the wavelength-scale
(e.g. kidney stone in lithotripsy) inside body.

shows that when the transverse zero current phase advance is below $90$
degrees, the beam envelope can still become unstable if the longitudinal zero
current phase advance is beyond $90$ degrees. For the transverse zero current
phase advance beyond $90$ degrees, the instability stopband width becomes
larger with the increase of the longitudinal focusing strength and even shows
different structure from the 2D case when the longitudinal zero current phase
advance is beyond $90$ degrees. Breaking the symmetry of two longitudinal
focusing RF cavities and the symmetry between the horizontal focusing and the
vertical focusing in the transverse plane in the periodic quadrupole and RF

observed continuous emergence of small-scale magnetic bipoles with a rate of
$\sim$10$^{16}$ Mx~s$^{-1}$. The emergence of magnetic fluxes and interactions
between different polarities lead to frequent occurrence of ultraviolet (UV)
bursts, which exhibit as intense transient brightenings in the 1400 \AA{}
images. In the meantime, discrete small patches with the same magnetic polarity
tend to move together and merge, leading to enhancement of the magnetic fields
and thus formation of pores (small sunspots) at some locations. The spectra of
these UV bursts are characterized by the superposition of several chromospheric
absorption lines on the greatly broadened profiles of some emission lines
formed at typical transition region temperatures, suggesting heating of the
local materials to a few tens of thousands of kelvin in the lower atmosphere by
magnetic reconnection. Some bursts reveal blue and red shifts of
$\sim$100~km~s$^{-1}$ at neighboring pixels, indicating the spatially resolved
bidirectional reconnection outflows. Many such bursts appear to be associated
with the cancellation of magnetic fluxes with a rate of the order of
$\sim$10$^{15}$ Mx~s$^{-1}$. We also investigate the three-dimensional magnetic
field topology through a magneto-hydrostatic model and find that a small
fraction of the bursts are associated with bald patches (magnetic dips).
Finally, we find that almost all bursts are located in regions of large
squashing factor at the height of $\sim$1 Mm, reinforcing our conclusion that
these bursts are produced through reconnection in the lower atmosphere.

started with a correlation function in terms of some interpolating and
transition currents in $ x $-space. For simplicity, the calculations are then
transformed to the momentum space by a Fourier transformation. To suppress the
contributions of the higher states and continuum; and enhance the ground state
contribution, Borel transformation as well as continuum subtraction are applied
by the help of quark-hadron duality assumption. In the present study we work
out the mathematics required for these processes in the case of light and
multi-heavy hadrons. We address a well-known problem in subtraction of the
effects of the higher states and continuum and discuss how we find finite
results without any divergence by using an appropriate representation of the
modified Bessel functions, appearing in the heavy quark propagator, and
successive applications of the Borel transformations, which lead to more
suppression of the higher states and continuum contributions. The results
obtained can be used in determination of the spectroscopic and decay properties
of the multi-heavy standard and non-conventional (exotic) systems in many
non-perturbative methods, specially the QCD sum rules.

adopted in image generation tasks. We observe that the state-of-the-art
achievements were obtained by carefully balancing the reconstruction loss and
adversarial loss, and such balance shifts with different network structures,
datasets, and training strategies. Empirical studies have demonstrated that an
inappropriate weight between the two losses may cause instability, and it is
tricky to search for the optimal setting, especially when lacking prior
knowledge on the data and network.
  This paper gives the first attempt to relax the need of manual balancing by
proposing the concept of \textit{decoupled learning}, where a novel network
structure is designed that explicitly disentangles the backpropagation paths of
the two losses.
  Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and
generality of the proposed method. The other contribution of the paper is the
design of a new evaluation metric to measure the image quality of generative
models. We propose the so-called \textit{normalized relative discriminative
score} (NRDS), which introduces the idea of relative comparison, rather than
providing absolute estimates like existing metrics.

using nominally-typed OO programming languages. Extant domain-theoretic models
of OOP developed to analyze OO type systems miss, however, a crucial feature of
these mainstream OO languages: nominality. This paper presents the construction
of NOOP as the first domain-theoretic model of OOP that includes full
class/type names information found in nominally-typed OOP. Inclusion of nominal
information in objects of NOOP and asserting that type inheritance in
statically-typed OO programming languages is an inherently nominal notion allow
readily proving that type inheritance and subtyping are completely identified
in these languages. This conclusion is in full agreement with intuitions of
developers and language designers of these OO languages, and contrary to the
belief that ""inheritance is not subtyping,"" which came from assuming
non-nominal (a.k.a., structural) models of OOP.
  To motivate the construction of NOOP, this paper briefly presents the
benefits of nominal-typing to mainstream OO developers and OO language
designers, as compared to structural-typing. After presenting NOOP, the paper
further briefly compares NOOP to the most widely known domain-theoretic models
of OOP. Leveraging the development of NOOP, the comparisons presented in this
paper provide clear, brief and precise technical and mathematical accounts for
the relation between nominal and structural OO type systems. NOOP, thus,
provides a firmer semantic foundation for analyzing and progressing
nominally-typed OO programming languages.

is much more limited, so often leverages RGB large datasets, by transferring
pretrained RGB CNN models and fine-tuning with the target RGB-D dataset.
However, we show that this approach has the limitation of hardly reaching
bottom layers, which is key to learn modality-specific features. In contrast,
we focus on the bottom layers, and propose an alternative strategy to learn
depth features combining local weakly supervised training from patches followed
by global fine tuning with images. This strategy is capable of learning very
discriminative depth-specific features with limited depth images, without
resorting to Places-CNN. In addition we propose a modified CNN architecture to
further match the complexity of the model and the amount of data available. For
RGB-D scene recognition, depth and RGB features are combined by projecting them

occupation within a Markovian open quantum system approach. We show that ENAQT
appears due to two competing processes, namely the tendency of dephasing to
make the exciton population uniform, and the formation of an exciton density
gradient, defined by the source and the sink. Furthermore, we find a geometric
condition on the network for the appearance of ENAQT, relevant to natural and
artificial systems.

a universal bound $2\pi/(\pi+4)$ as expected. A cross-comparison of the
efficiencies of the accelerating black hole heat engines and Schwarzschild-AdS

efficiency although the amount of increase is not remarkable.

principal concepts and methods in risk-based testing is needed to enable a
comparison of the weaknesses and strengths of different risk-based testing

consists of three top-level classes, i.e., contextual setup, risk assessment,

native libraries written in unsafe languages. When runtime references across
isolation boundaries occur relatively infrequently, then conventional
page-based hardware isolation can be used, because the cost of kernel- or
hypervisor-mediated domain switching is tolerable. However, some applications,
such as the isolation of cryptographic session keys in network-facing services,
require very frequent domain switching. In such applications, the overhead of
kernel- or hypervisor-mediated domain switching is prohibitive.
  In this paper, we present ERIM, a novel technique that provides
hardware-enforced isolation with low overhead on x86 CPUs, even at high
switching rates (ERIM's measured overhead is less than 1% for 100,000 switches
per second). The key idea is to combine protection keys (MPKs), a feature
recently added to x86 that allows protection domain switches in userspace, with
binary inspection to prevent circumvention. We show that ERIM can be applied
with little effort to new and existing applications, doesn't require compiler
changes, can run on a stock Linux kernel, and has low runtime overhead even at
high domain switching rates.

complementary effect among different dimensions of records for modeling users'
behavioral patterns. To deeply exploit such a complementary effect, we propose
a joint model to capture both online and offline features of a user's composite
behavior. We evaluate the proposed joint model by comparing with some typical
models on two real-world datasets: Foursquare and Yelp. In the widely-used
setting of theft simulation (simulating thefts via behavioral replacement), the
experimental results show that our model outperforms the existing ones, with
the AUC values $0.956$ in Foursquare and $0.947$ in Yelp, respectively.
Particularly, the recall (True Positive Rate) can reach up to $65.3\%$ in
Foursquare and $72.2\%$ in Yelp with the corresponding disturbance rate (False
Positive Rate) below $1\%$. It is worth mentioning that these performances can
be achieved by examining only one composite behavior (visiting a place and
posting a tip online simultaneously) per authentication, which guarantees the
low response latency of our method. This study would give the cybersecurity
community new insights into whether and how a real-time online identity
authentication can be improved via modeling users' composite behavioral

The purpose of the algorithm is to match the generating distribution $Q(x)$ to
the changing channel $P(y\,|\,x)$, so that reliable communication is maintained
at some constant rate $R$. This is achieved by a feedback of one bit per
transmitted block. The feedback bit is determined by the joint type of the last

to dimension-six, we obtain accurate QCD sum rules for the moments
$\langle\xi_{n;J/\psi}^\|\rangle$. The first three ones are
$\langle\xi_{2;J/\psi}^\|\rangle=0.083(12)$,
$\langle\xi_{4;J/\psi}^\|\rangle=0.015(5)$ and
$\langle\xi_{6;J/\psi}^\|\rangle=0.003(2)$, leading to a single peaked behavior
for $\phi_{2;J/\psi}^\|$ which is sharper than the previous ones around the
region of $x\sim0.5$. As an application, we adopt the QCD light-cone sum rules
to calculate the $B_c$ meson semileptonic decay $B_c^+ \to J/\psi \ell^+

cyclone research to estimate the minimum central pressure and the maximum
velocity of tropical storms from environmental parameters. The MPI pressure
derives from consideration of an idealized thermodynamic cycle, while the MPI
velocity additionally requires information about real-time power and heat flows
within the storm. Recently MPI velocity was proposed to be a substantial
overestimate (by 10-30 percent) presumably neglecting the power needed to lift
precipitating water (the gravitational power of precipitation). This conclusion
did not involve a theoretical analysis of the MPI concept but was based on
observed hurricane rainfall to estimate gravitational power of precipitation.
However, since the MPI pressure estimate does explicitly account for lifting
water, and the MPI velocity derives from this pressure, the question arises
whether a correction to MPI velocity is required. Here we represent and examine
the MPI derivations in their most general form and show that although a
correction to MPI velocity is justified, it is an order of magnitude or so
smaller than originally proposed. We show that the neglect of gravitational
power of precipitation in the MPI velocity estimate was caused by the
incomplete formulation of the general relationship between pressure work and
dissipation of kinetic energy, taken per unit time and integrated over the
storm. We highlight the importance of an internally consistent framework to
estimate both storm energy and power and provide some perspectives for further
investigating the role of moisture.

Due to its low transmission power and low transmission efficiency, it requires
much longer time slot to charge users compared with that for data transmission
in wireless communication networks. Besides, each user's demand urgency needs
to be taken into consideration for power allocation. Therefore, new algorithms
are essential for wireless power allocation in multi-user wireless charging
networks. In this paper, this problem is formulated as a static noncooperative
game. It is shown that there exists a unique Nash equilibrium, which is the
static state of the wireless power charging network. A distributed power
allocation algorithm is proposed to compute the Nash equilibrium of the game.
The main result of the paper consists of rigorous analysis of the distributed
algorithm for power allocation. The algorithm is shown to converge to Nash
equilibrium of the game with exponentially convergence rate for arbitrary
initial value with synchronous scheduling. Moreover, the distributed algorithm
is also convergence guaranteed with asynchronous scheduling under communication
delay and packet drops. Numerical simulations prove the correctness of the
analysis and demonstrate the fast convergence of the algorithm and the
robustness to synchronous scheduling.

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/sty182",,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing relies on accurate spot centre measurement.
Several algorithms were developed with this aim, mostly focused on precision,
i.e. minimizing random errors. In the solar and extended scene community, the
importance of the accuracy (bias error due to peak-locking, quantisation or
sampling) of the centroid determination was identified and solutions proposed.
But these solutions only allow partial bias corrections. To date, no systematic
study of the bias error was conducted. This article bridges the gap by
quantifying the bias error for different correlation peak-finding algorithms
and types of sub-aperture images and by proposing a practical solution to
minimize its effects. Four classes of sub-aperture images (point source,
elongated laser guide star, crowded field and solar extended scene) together
with five types of peak-finding algorithms (1D parabola, the centre of gravity,
Gaussian, 2D quadratic polynomial and pyramid) are considered, in a variety of
signal-to-noise conditions. The best performing peak-finding algorithm depends
on the sub-aperture image type, but none is satisfactory to both bias and
random errors. A practical solution is proposed that relies on the
anti-symmetric response of the bias to the sub-pixel position of the true
centre. The solution decreases the bias by a factor of ~7 to values of < 0.02
pix. The computational cost is typically twice of current cross-correlation
algorithms.

cloud of atoms at {\mu}K temperature. We directly observe the sympathetic
cooling dynamics with single-shot energy measurements during one, to several,
collisions in two distinct regimes. In one, collisions predominantly cool the
system with very efficient momentum transfer leading to cooling in only a few
collisions. In the other, collisions can both cool and heat the system due to
the non-equilibrium dynamics of the atom-ion collisions in the presence of the
ion-trap's oscillating electric fields. While the bulk of our observations
agree well with a molecular dynamics simulation of hard-sphere (Langevin)
collisions, a measurement of the scattering angle distribution reveals
forward-scattering (glancing) collisions which are beyond the Langevin model.
