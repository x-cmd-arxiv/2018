inaccessible to their classical counterparts. The most famous example is the
distribution of secret key. However, in the absence of quantum repeaters, the
rate at which these tasks can be performed is dictated by the losses in the
quantum channel. In practice, channel losses have limited the reach of quantum
protocols to short distances. Quantum repeaters have the potential to
significantly increase the rates and reach beyond the limits of direct
transmission. However, no experimental implementation has overcome the direct
transmission threshold. Here, we propose three quantum repeater schemes and
assess their ability to generate secret key when implemented on a setup using
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond with near-term experimental
parameters. We find that one of these schemes - the so-called single-photon
scheme, requiring no quantum storage - has the ability to surpass the capacity
- the highest secret-key rate achievable with direct transmission - by a factor
of 7 for a distance of approximately 9.2 km with near-term parameters,
establishing it as a prime candidate for the first experimental realization of
a quantum repeater.

Preprint results",,,,"cs.CV cs.MM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Recent success in deep reinforcement learning is having an agent learn how to
play Go and beat the world champion without any prior knowledge of the game. In
that task, the agent has to make a decision on what action to take based on the
positions of the pieces. Person Search is recently explored using natural
language based text description of images for video surveillance applications
(S.Li et.al). We see (Fu.et al) provides an end to end approach for
object-based retrieval using deep reinforcement learning without constraints
placed on which objects are being detected. However, we believe for real-world
applications such as person search defining specific constraints which identify
a person as opposed to starting with a general object detection will have
benefits in terms of performance and computational resources required. In our
task, Deep reinforcement learning would localize the person in an image by
reshaping the sizes of the bounding boxes. Deep Reinforcement learning with
appropriate constraints would look only for the relevant person in the image as
opposed to an unconstrained approach where each individual objects in the image
are ranked. For person search, the agent is trying to form a tight bounding box
around the person in the image who matches the description. The bounding box is
initialized to the full image and at each time step, the agent makes a decision
on how to change the current bounding box so that it has a tighter bound around
the person based on the description of the person and the pixel values of the
current bounding box. After the agent takes an action, it will be given a
reward based on the Intersection over Union (IoU) of the current bounding box
and the ground truth box. Once the agent believes that the bounding box is
covering the person, it will indicate that the person is found.

the inertial parameters is available from experiments and computer-aided design

value of inertial parameters. In this work, we propose a new momentum
model-based method for identifying the minimal parameters of a space robot
while on orbit. Minimal parameters are combinations of the inertial parameters
of the links and uniquely define the momentum and dynamic models. Consequently,
they are sufficient for motion planning and control of both the satellite and
robotic arms mounted on it. The key to the proposed framework is the unique
formulation of momentum model in the linear form of minimal parameters.
Further, to estimate the minimal parameters, we propose a novel joint
trajectory planning and optimization technique based on direction combinations
of joints' velocity. The efficacy of the identification framework is
demonstrated on a 12 degrees-of-freedom, spatial, dual-arm space robot. The
methodology is developed for tree-type space robots, requires just the pose and

both first and second order, it is said to be of 'mixed order' or to display
the Thouless effect. Such a transition is present in a simple model of a
dynamic social network, in which $N_{I/E}$ extreme introverts/extroverts always
cut/add random links. In particular, simulations showed that $\left\langle
f\right\rangle $, the average fraction of cross-links between the two groups
(which serves as an 'order parameter' here), jumps dramatically when $\Delta
\equiv N_{I}-N_{E}$ crosses the 'critical point' $\Delta _{c}=0$, as in typical
first order transitions. Yet, at criticality, there is no phase co-existence,
but the fluctuations of $f$ are much larger than in typical second order
transitions. Indeed, it was conjectured that, in the thermodynamic limit, both
the jump and the fluctuations become maximal, so that the system is said to
display an 'extreme Thouless effect.' While earlier theories are partially
successful, we provide a mean-field like approach that accounts for all known
simulation data and validates the conjecture. Moreover, for the critical system
$N_{I}=N_{E}=L$, an analytic expression for the mesa-like stationary
distribution, $P\left( f\right) $, shows that it is essentially flat in a range
$\left[ f_{0},1-f_{0}\right] $, with $f_0 \ll 1$. Numerical evaluations of
$f_{0}$ provides excellent agreement with simulation data for $L\lesssim 2000$.
For large $L$, we find $f_{0}\rightarrow \sqrt{\left( \ln L^2 \right) /L}$ ,
though this behavior begins to set in only for $L>10^{100}$. For accessible
values of $L$, we provide a transcendental equation for an approximate $f_{0}$
which is better than $\sim$1% down to $L=100$. We conjecture how this approach
might be used to attack other systems displaying an extreme Thouless effect.

tasks from a teleoperated demonstration with a hydraulic manipulator. Due to
the use of extremely powerful hydraulic manipulator, a force-reflected
bilateral teleoperation is the most reasonable method of giving a human
demonstration. An advanced subsystem-dynamic-based control design framework,
virtual decomposition control (VDC), is used to design a stability-guaranteed
controller for the teleoperation system, while taking into account the full
nonlinear dynamics of the master and slave manipulators. The use of fragile
force/ torque sensor at the tip of the hydraulic slave manipulator is avoided
by estimating the contact forces from the manipulator actuators' chamber
pressures. In the proposed learning method, it is observed that a
surface-sliding tool has a friction-dependent range of directions (between the
actual direction of motion and the contact force) from which the manipulator
can apply force to produce the sliding motion. By this intuition, an
intersection of these ranges can be taken over a motion to robustly find a
desired direction for the motion from one or more demonstrations. The compliant
axes required to reproduce the motion can be found by assuming that all motions
outside the desired direction is caused by the environment, signalling the need
for compliance. Finally, the learning method is incorporated to a novel
VDC-based impedance control method to learn compliant behaviour from
teleoperated human demonstrations. Experiments with 2-DOF hydraulic manipulator
with a 475kg payload demonstrate the suitability and effectiveness of the
proposed method to perform learning from demonstration (LfD) with heavy-duty
hydraulic manipulators.

quantum plant and a directly coupled coherent quantum observer. We employ
discounted quadratic performance criteria in the form of exponentially weighted
time averages of second-order moments of the system variables.
Small-gain-theorem bounds are obtained for the back-action of the observer on
the covariance dynamics of the plant in terms of the plant-observer coupling. A
coherent quantum filtering (CQF) problem is formulated as the minimization of
the discounted mean square of an estimation error, with which the dynamic
variables of the observer approximate those of the plant. The cost functional
also involves a quadratic penalty on the plant-observer coupling matrix in
order to mitigate the back-action effect. For the discounted mean square
optimal CQF problem with penalized back-action, we establish first-order
necessary conditions of optimality in the form of algebraic matrix equations.
By using the Hamiltonian structure of the Heisenberg dynamics and Lie-algebraic
techniques, this set of equations is represented in a more explicit form for
equally dimensioned plant and observer. For a class of such observers with
autonomous estimation error dynamics, we obtain a solution of the CQF problem
and outline a homotopy method. The computation of the performance criteria and
the observer synthesis are illustrated by numerical examples.

Class~0 and Class~I objects have been well-studied, but while previous works
have hinted at or found a few Keplerian disks at the Class~0 stage, it remains
to be seen if their presence in this early stage is the norm. Likewise, while
complex organics have been detected toward some Class~0 objects, their
distribution is unknown as they could reside in the hottest parts of the
envelope, in the emerging disk itself or in other components of the
protostellar system, such as shocked regions related to outflows.
  Aims: In this work, we aim to address two related issues regarding
protostars: when rotationally supported disks form around deeply embedded
protostars and where complex organic molecules reside in such objects.
  Methods: We observed the deeply embedded protostar, L483, using Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band~7 data from Cycles~1 and 3 with a
high angular resolution down to $\sim$~0.1$^{\prime\prime}$ (20~au) scales.
  Results: We find that the kinematics of CS~$J=7$--$6$ and
H$^{13}$CN~$J=4$--$3$ are best fitted by the velocity profile from infall under
conservation of angular momentum and not by a Keplerian profile. The spatial
extents of the observed complex organics are consistent with an estimated ice
sublimation radius of the envelope at $\sim$~50~au, suggesting that the complex
organics exist in the hot corino of L483.
  Conclusions: We find that L483 does not harbor a Keplerian disk down to at
least $15$~au in radius. Instead, the innermost regions of L483 are undergoing
a rotating collapse. This result highlights that some Class~0 objects contain
only very small disks, or none at all, with the complex organic chemistry
taking place on scales inside the hot corino of the envelope, in a region
larger than the emerging disk.

instabilities in accelerators. However, the heavy computation load often limits
the capability of the tracking codes. One widely used macro-particle tracking
code to simulate collective instabilities in storage rings is mbtrack. The
Message Passing Interface (MPI) is already implemented in the original mbtrack
to accelerate the simulations. However, many CPU threads are requested in
mbtrack for the analysis of the coupled-bunch instabilities. Therefore,
computer clusters or desktops with many CPU cores are needed. Since these are
not always available, we employ as alternative a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
with CUDA programming interface to run such simulations in a stand-alone
workstation. All the heavy computations have been moved to the GPU. The
benchmarks confirm that mbtrack-cuda can be used to analyze coupled bunch
instabilities up to at least 484 bunches. Compared to mbtrack on an 8-core CPU,
36-core CPU and a cluster, mbtrack-cuda is faster for simulations of up to 3
bunches. For 363 bunches, mbtrack-cuda needs about six times the execution time
of the cluster and twice of the 36-core CPU. The multi-bunch instability
analysis shows that the length of the ion-cleaning gap has no big influence, at
least at filling to 3/4.

of what he called ""matrices"", which we would today call ""finite Heyting
Algebras"". He then gave a very brief sketch of a proof that if a propositional
formula holds in each of these algebras then it is provable in intuitionistic
propositional logic (IPL). The sketch just describes a certain normal form for
propositional formulas and gives a very terse outline of an inductive argument
showing that an unprovable formula in the normal form can be refuted in one of
the algebras. Unfortunately, it is far from clear how to recover a complete
proof from this sketch. In the early 1950s, Gene F. Rose gave a detailed proof
of Ja\'skowski's result, still using the notion of matrix rather than Heyting
algebra, based on a normal form that is more restrictive than the one that
Ja\'skowski proposed. However, Rose's paper refers to his thesis for additional
details, particularly concerning the normal form.
  This note gives a proof of Ja\'skowski's result using modern terminology and
a normal form more like Ja\'skowski's. We also prove a semantic property of the
normal form enabling us to give an alternative proof of completeness of IPL for
the Heyting algebra semantics. We outline a decision procedure for IPL based on
our proofs and illustrate it in action on some simple examples.

However, the task is challenging, even more so for evolving graphs due to the

  In this paper, we initiate the study of the approximate FSM problem in both
incremental and fully-dynamic streaming settings, where arbitrary edges can be
added or removed from the graph. For each streaming setting, we propose
algorithms that can extract a high-quality approximation of the frequent

high probability. In contrast to the existing state-of-the-art solutions that
require iterating over the entire set of subgraphs for any update, our

optimized neighborhood-exploration procedures local to the updates. We provide
theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithms and empirically demonstrate
that the proposed algorithms generate high-quality results compared to

from the classic image classification algorithms, our classifier has been
constructed in the form of a fast 39-layered Inception model, that evaluates
the presence of roads using the tomographic reconstructions of the input
frames. Based on the Inception-v3 architecture, our system performs better in
terms of processing complexity and accuracy than many existing models for
imitation learning. The data used for training the system has been captured
from the drone, by flying it in and around urban and semi-urban streets, by
experts having at least 6-8 years of flying experience. Permissions were taken
from required authorities who made sure that minimal risk (to pedestrians) is
involved in the data collection process. With the extensive amount of drone
data that we collected, we have been able to navigate successfully through
roads without crashing or overshooting, with an accuracy of 98.44%. The
computational efficiency of MAVNet enables the drone to fly at high speeds of
upto 6m/sec. We present the same results in this research and compare them with

about unconfoundedness are not testable from data. Assessing sensitivity to
such assumptions is therefore important in practice. Unfortunately, some
existing sensitivity analysis approaches inadvertently impose restrictions that
are at odds with modern causal inference methods, which emphasize flexible
models for observed data. To address this issue, we propose a framework that
allows (1) flexible models for the observed data and (2) clean separation of
the identified and unidentified parts of the sensitivity model. Our framework
extends an approach from the missing data literature, known as Tukey's
factorization, to the causal inference setting. Under this factorization, we
can represent the distributions of unobserved potential outcomes in terms of
unidentified selection functions that posit an unidentified relationship
between the treatment assignment indicator and the observed potential outcomes.
The sensitivity parameters in this framework are easily interpreted, and we
provide heuristics for calibrating these parameters against observable
quantities. We demonstrate the flexibility of this approach in two examples,
where we estimate both average treatment effects and quantile treatment effects
using Bayesian nonparametric models for the observed data.

quantum mechanics that extends the von Neumann-Lueders collapse postulate to
observables with continuous spectrum. His collapse postulate does not determine
a unique state change, but depends on a particular choice of an invariant mean.
To clear the physical significance of employing different invariant means, we
construct different measuring processes of the same observable satisfying the
Srinivas collapse postulate corresponding to any given invariant means. Our
construction extends the von Neumann type measuring process with the meter
being the position observable to the one with the apparatus prepared in a
non-normal state. It is shown that the given invariant mean corresponds to the
momentum distribution of the apparatus in the initial state, which is
determined as a non-normal state, called a Dirac state, such that the momentum
distribution is the given invariant mean and that the position distribution is
the Dirac measure.

seamless integrates entropy-induced and bootstrap-induced techniques for
efficient and deep exploration of the learning environment. Specifically, a
general form of Tsallis entropy regularizer will be utilized to drive
entropy-induced exploration based on efficient approximation of optimal
action-selection policies. Different from many existing works that rely on
action dithering strategies for exploration, our algorithm is efficient in
exploring actions with clear exploration value. Meanwhile, by employing an
ensemble of Q-networks under varied Tsallis entropy regularization, the
diversity of the ensemble can be further enhanced to enable effective

canonical definition of an HCHII region at 5 GHz. We suggest that the current
canonical definition of HCHII regions is not accurate and should be revised to
include a hierarchical structure of ionized gas that results in an extended
morphology at 5 GHz. Correlating our search with known ultracompact (UC) HII
region surveys, we find that roughly half of detected UCHII regions have
positive spectral indices, instead of more commonly assumed flat and optically
thin spectra. This implies a mix of optically thin and thick emission and has
important implications for previous analyses which have so far assumed
optically thin emission for these objects. Positive spectrum HII regions are
statistically more luminous and possess higher Lyman continuum fluxes than HII
regions with flat or negative indices. Positive spectrum HII regions are thus
more likely to be associated with more luminous and massive stars. No
differences are found in clump mass, linear diameter or luminosity-to-mass
ratio between positive spectrum and non-positive spectrum HII regions.

processes, provides insight into how network structure affects global
behaviour. Yet many methods for network dynamics fail to cope with large or
partially-known networks, a ubiquitous situation in real-world applications.
Here we propose a localised method, applicable to a broad class of dynamical
models on networks, whereby individual nodes monitor and store the evolution of
their own state and use these values to approximate, via a simple computation,
their own steady state solution. Hence the nodes predict their own final state
without actually reaching it. Furthermore, the localised formulation enables
nodes to compute global network metrics without knowledge of the full network
structure. The method can be used to compute global rankings in the network
from local information; to detect community detection from fast, local
transient dynamics; and to identify key nodes that compute global network
metrics ahead of others. We illustrate some of the applications of the
algorithm by efficiently performing web-page ranking for a large internet
network and identifying the dynamic roles of inter-neurons in the C. Elegans
neural network. The mathematical formulation is simple, widely applicable and
easily scalable to real-world datasets suggesting how local computation can
provide an approach to the study of large-scale network dynamics.

where the probability that any two nodes in distance $d$ away from each other
are socially connected is assumed to be proportional to $d^{-\gamma}$, which is

representations, we first incorporate a sample-affinity matrix into the
marginalized stacked denoising Autoencoder (mSDA) to obtain shared features,
which are then combined with the private features. In order to make the feature
representations of videos across views transferable, we then learn a
transferable dictionary pair simultaneously from pairs of videos taken at
different views to encourage each action video across views to have the same
sparse representation. However, the distribution difference across views still
exists because a unified subspace where the sparse representations of one
action across views are the same may not exist when the view difference is
large. Therefore, we propose a novel unsupervised distribution adaptation
method that learns a set of projections that project the source and target
views data into respective low-dimensional subspaces where the marginal and

finally learned feature representation is view-invariant and robust for
substantial distribution difference across views even the view difference is

Sobolev $W^k_p$ and fractional Sobolev $W^{k+\alpha}_p$ classes as well. Note
that we study the Sobolev case under minimal integrability assumptions
$p=\max(1,n/k)$, i.e., it guarantees in general only {\it the continuity} (not
everywhere differentiability) of a mapping. In particular, there is an
interesting and unexpected analytical phenomena here: if $\tau=n$ (i.e., in the
case of Morse--Sard theorem), then the value $\sigma(\tau)$ is the same for the
Sobolev $W^k_p$ and for the classical $C^k$-smooth case. But if $\tau<n$, then
the value $\sigma$ depends on $p$ also; the value $\sigma$ for $C^k$ case could
be obtained as the limit when $p\to\infty$. The similar phenomena holds for
Holder continuous $C^{k+\alpha}$ and for the fractional Sobolev
$W^{k+\alpha}_p$ classes. The proofs of the most results are based on our

To reduce the delivery latency and the burden on fronthaul links and make full
use of the local cache and baseband signal processing capabilities of enhanced
remote radio heads (eRRHs), a two-level transmission scheme including
cache-level and network-level transmission is proposed. In cache-level
transmission, only requested files cached at the local cache are transmitted to
the corresponding users. The duration of cache-level transmission is the delay
caused by the transfer between the baseband unit (BBU) and eRRHs as well as the
signal processing at the BBU. The remaining requested files are jointly
transmitted to the corresponding users at network-level transmission. For
cache-level transmission, a centralized optimization algorithm is firstly
presented and then a decentralized optimization algorithm is provided to avoid
the exchange of signaling among eRRHs. Meanwhile, another centralized
optimization algorithm is presented to tackle the optimization problem for
network-level transmission. All presented algorithms are proved to converge to
the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solutions of the problems. Numerical results are
provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed transmission scheme as
well as evaluating the system performance.

gives insights on the behaviour of light at interfaces, is violated if there
exists dissipation in the transmitting media. In order to overcome this
problem, we extend the angle of refraction from a real number to a complex
number. We use this complex-angle approach to analyse the behaviour of light at
interfaces between lossy media and lossless media. We reveal that dissipation
makes the wavenumber of the light exceed the maximum allowed at lossless
interfaces. This is surprising because, in general, dielectric loss only change
the intensity profiles of the light, so this excess wavenumber cannot be
produced in the bulk even if there exists dielectric loss. Additionally,
anomalous circular polarisation emerges with dissipation. The direction of the
anomalous circular polarisation is transverse, whereas without dissipation the
direction of circular polarisation has to be longitudinal. We also discuss how
the excess wavenumber can increase optical force and how the anomalous circular
polarisation can generate optical transverse torque. This novel state of light
produced by dissipation will pave the way for a new generation of optical
trapping and manipulation.

the other side of the network that is the primary network which is under
interference from SU. Also, it is the primary user (PU) that decides upon the
interference temperature constraint for power adaptation to maintain a certain

the expressions generated are validated with the simulation results and it is

problems with orthogonality constraints. Note that the Riemannian Hessian of
the objective function requires both the Euclidean Hessian and the Euclidean

Hessian itself consists of a computational cheap part and a significantly
expensive part. Our basic idea is to keep these parts of lower computational
costs but substitute those parts of higher computational costs by the
limited-memory quasi-Newton update. More specically, the part related to
Euclidean gradient and the cheaper parts in the Euclidean Hessian are
preserved. The initial quasi-Newton matrix is further constructed from a
limited-memory Nystr\""om approximation to the expensive part. Consequently, our
subproblems approximate the original objective function in the Euclidean space

vector transports. When the subproblems are solved to sufficient accuracy, both
global and local q-superlinear convergence can be established under mild

blockchain, they are therefore greatly affected by the performance of the P2P
network. In bitcoin, the miners are engaged in a time-sensitive competition to

raises a critical problem to minimize the time between the propagation of a
winning block and the beginning of the next round of the competition. This
paper proposes a method that selects a node's closest neighbors to make

distance from a node to its neighbor using transmission latency; thus, the
lower the latency, the closer the neighbor. Simulations showed a good rate of
decrease in average propagation latency and maximum propagation latency,
compared to the classic method. Furthermore, this paper not only proposes the
principle of establishing connections based on latency, but also evaluates the

whose containment similarity regarding Q are not less than the given threshold.
This problem has many important applications in commercial and scientific
fields such as record matching and domain search. Existing solution relies on
the asymmetric LSH method by transforming the containment similarity to
well-studied Jaccard similarity. In this paper, we use a different framework by
transforming the containment similarity to set intersection. We propose a novel

GB-KMV is over 100 times faster than LSH-E on some real-life dataset.

complex network. Numerous similarity indices have been defined and
investigated, but the dependency of structure on the performance of similarity
indices has not been sufficiently investigated. In this study, we investigated
the relationship between the performance of similarity indices and structural
properties of a network by employing a two-state random network. A node in a
two-state network has binary types that are initially given, and a connection
probability is determined from the state of the node pair. The performance of
similarity indices affects the number of links and the ratio of
intra-connections to inter-connections. Similarity indices have different
characteristics depending on their type. Local indices perform well in
small-size networks and do not depend on whether the structure is
intra-dominant or inter-dominant. In contrast, global indices perform better in
large-size networks, and some such indices do not perform well in an
inter-dominant structure. We also found that link prediction performance and
the performance of similarity are correlated in both model networks and
empirical networks. This relationship implies that link prediction performance
can be used as an approximation for the performance of the similarity index
when metadata for node types are unavailable. This relationship may help to
find the appropriate index for given networks.

the radial coordinate to transform the free boundary problem to a fixed

equations. We show that the conventional finite volume methods fail to preserve
constant solutions and the incompressibility condition, and they typically lead
to inaccurate, if not wrong, solutions even for very simple tests. These issues
are addressed in a new finite volume framework with segregated flux
computations that satisfy sufficient conditions for ensuring the so-called
totality conservation law and the geometric conservation law. Classical
first-order and second-order finite volume methods are enhanced in this
framework. Their performance is assessed by various benchmark tests to show
that the enhanced methods are able to preserve the incompressibility constraint
and produce much more accurate results than the conventional ones.

describes an architecture for cryptographically protecting these markers, which

still debated. The most puzzling aspects are 1) how the Tethys-Dione pair and
the Mimas-Enceladus pair passed through their strong 3:2 mean-motion resonances
during the tidal orbital evolution, and 2) the current strong heat flow from
Enceladus, which is a few orders of magnitude higher than the tidal energy
dissipation caused by the present orbital eccentricity of Enceladus. Here we
perform N-body simulations of the moons' orbital evolution from various initial
conditions -- assuming that the moons were formed from Saturn's hypothetical
massive ring -- and investigate possible paths to solve the above difficulties.
If the influence of the rings is neglected, we find that the Tethys-Dione pair
cannot avoid becoming trapped in the mean-motion resonances as they recede from
Saturn, and that the Tethys-Enceladus pair cannot avoid collisions after the
resonance trapping, in case Saturn's quality factor is smaller than 15,000.
These findings are inconsistent with the current orbital configuration.
However, taking into account both the eccentricity excitation and the orbital
expansion caused by the ring torque, we find that these resonance captures are
avoided. With the high eccentricity pumped up by the torque, Enceladus passes
through the resonances with Tethys, and the Dione-Tethys pair passes through
their 2:1 and possibly the 3:2 resonance as well. After Enceladus resides
beyond the 2:1 resonance with the outer ring edge, the eccentricity can be
tidally damped. While this is a promising path of evolution, in most runs,
Enceladus collides with Tethys by the excited eccentricity. There is a hint
that a ring mass decrease could avoid the collision. The tidal heat due to the
eccentricity excitation by the ring torque is stored in the moons and slowly
radiated away. It may account for the current high heat flow.

subluminal case, LIV effects may result in a significant reduction of the
$\gamma-\gamma$ opacity for photons with energies $\gtrsim 10$ TeV. However,
the effect is not expected to be sufficient to explain the apparent spectral
hardening of several observed VHE $\gamma$-ray sources in the energy range from
100 GeV - a few TeV, even when including effects of plausible inhomogeneities
in the cosmic structure. Superluminal modifications of the photon dispersion
relation lead to a further enhancement of the EBL $\gamma\gamma$ opacity. We
consider, for the first time, the influence of LIV on the Compton scattering
process. We find that this effect becomes relevant only for photons at
ultra-high energies, $E \gtrsim 1$ PeV. In the case of a superluminal

function of disk radius in protoplanetary disks. In this work we investigate if
spatially resolved observations of rarer CO isotopologues may be good tracers
of Sigma_gas. Physical-chemical models with different input Sigma_gas(R) are
run. The input disk surface density profiles are compared with the simulated
13CO intensity radial profiles to check if and where the two follow each other.
There is always an intermediate region in the disk where the slope of the 13CO
radial emission profile and Sigma_gas(R) coincide. At small radii the line
radial profile underestimates Sigma_gas, as 13CO emission becomes optically
thick. The same happens at large radii where the column densities become too
low and 13CO is not able to efficiently self-shield. If the gas surface density
profile is a simple power-law of the radius, the input power-law index can be
retrieved within 20% uncertainty if one choses the proper radial range. If
instead Sigma_gas(R) follows the self-similar solution for a viscously evolving
disk, retrieving the input power-law index becomes challenging, in particular
for small disks. Nevertheless, it is found that the power-law index can be in
any case reliably fitted at a given line intensity contour around 6 K km/s, and
this produces a practical method to constrain the slope of Sigma_gas(R).
Application of such a method is shown in the case study of the TW Hya disk.
Spatially resolved 13CO line radial profiles are promising to probe the disk
surface density distribution, as they directly trace Sigma_gas(R)profile at
radii well resolvable by ALMA. There, chemical processes like freeze-out and
isotope selective photodissociation do not affect the emission, and, assuming
that the volatile carbon does not change with radius, no chemical model is
needed when interpreting the observations.

arises in the inflowing gas. Unfortunately, this emission is very faint and

urgently needed. Here we demonstrate the collaborative effect of substrate
flexibility and surface nanotexture on enhancing both icephobicity and the
repellency of viscous droplets. We first investigate the influence of increased
viscosity on impalement resistance and droplet-substrate contact time after
impact. Then we examine the effect of droplet partial solidification on recoil
and simulate more challenging icing conditions by impacting supercooled water
droplets onto flexible and rigid surfaces containing ice nucleation promoters.
We demonstrate a passive mechanism for shedding partially solidified droplets
under conditions where partial solidification occurs much faster than the
natural droplet oscillation which does not rely on converting droplet surface
energy into kinetic energy. Using an energy-based model, we identify a
previously unexplored mechanism whereby the substrate oscillation and velocity
govern the rebound process, with low-areal density and moderately stiff
substrates acting to efficiently absorb the incoming droplet kinetic energy and
rectify it back, allowing droplets to overcome adhesion and gravitational
forces, and recoil. This mechanism applies for a range of droplet viscosities,
spanning from low to high viscosity fluids and even ice slurries, which do not
rebound from rigid superhydrophobic substrates.

unravel regimes of regular motion in phase space where 1:1 resonant angles

Kryoneri telescope utilizing the fast-frame capabilities of scientific
Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor detectors (sCMOS). The system provides
a wide field-of-view (17.0' $\times$ 14.4') and simultaneous observations in
two photometric bands (R and I), reaching limiting magnitudes of 18.7 mag in 10
sec in both bands at a 2.5 signal-to-noise level. This makes it a unique
instrument that can be used for the detection of NEO impacts on the Moon, as
well as for any astronomy projects that demand high-cadence multicolor
observations. The wide field-of-view ensures that a large portion of the Moon
is observed, while the simultaneous, high-cadence, monitoring in two
photometric bands makes possible, for the first time, the determination of the

the Moon's surface we demonstrate that the NELIOTA system can detect NEO impact
flashes at a 2.5 signal-to-noise level of ~12.4 mag in the I-band and R-band
for observations made at low lunar phases ~0.1. We report 31 NEO impact flashes
detected during the first year of the NELIOTA campaign. The faintest flash was
at 11.24 mag in the R-band (about two magnitudes fainter than ever observed

environments demand richer information to improve robustness, efficiency, and

of motion of dynamic objects at various locations of the environment for safer
navigation or human-robot interaction. In this paper, we introduce directional
statistics into robotic mapping to model circular data. Primarily, in
collateral to occupancy grid maps, we propose directional grid maps to
represent the location-wide long-term angular motion of the environment. Being
highly representative, this defines a probability measure-field over the
longitude-latitude space rather than a scalar-field or a vector field. Withal,
we further demonstrate how the same theory can be used to model angular
variations in the spatial domain, temporal domain, and spatiotemporal domain.

along the northeast-southwest axis. On the other hand, the SO emission has a
compact distribution around the protostar. The CCH emission is relatively weak
at the continuum peak position, while the SO emission has a sharp peak there.
Although the maximum velocity shift of the CCH emission is about 1 km s^-1 from
the systemic velocity, a velocity shift higher than 2 km s^{-1} is seen for the
SO emission. This high velocity component is most likely associated with the
Keplerian rotation around the protostar. The protostellar mass is estimated to
be 0.007^{+0.004}_{-0.003} from the velocity profile of the SO emission. With
this protostellar mass, the velocity structure of the CCH emission can be
explained by the model of the infalling-rotating envelope, where the radius of
the centrifugal barrier is estimated to be 40 au from the comparison with the
model. The disk mass evaluated from the dust continuum emission by assuming the
dust temperature of 20 K-100 K is 0.1-0.9 times the stellar mass, resulting in
the Toomre Q parameter of 0.4-5. Hence, the disk structure may be partly

Collective oscillations emerge for sufficiently connected networks. Their
origin is understood in terms of a recently developed mean-field model, whose
stable solution is a focus. Microscopic irregular firings, due to balance,
trigger sustained oscillations by exciting the relaxation dynamics towards the
macroscopic focus. The same mechanism induces in balanced excitatory-inhibitory

and probed by in situ instruments. They are typically modeled as flux ropes
(FRs). The determination of the FR global characteristics requires the
estimation of the FR axis orientation. Among the developed methods, the minimum
variance (MV) is the most flexible, and features only a few assumptions.
However, as other methods, MV has biases. We aim to investigate the limits of
the method and extend it to a less biased method. We first identified the
origin of the biases by testing the MV method on cylindrical and elliptical
models with a temporal expansion comparable to the one observed in MCs. Then,
we developed an improved MV method to reduce these biases. In contrast with
many previous publications we find that the ratio of the MV eigenvalues is not
a reliable indicator of the precision of the derived FR axis direction. Next,
we emphasize the importance of the FR boundaries selected since they strongly
affect the deduced axis orientation. We have improved the MV method by imposing
that the same amount of azimuthal flux should be present before and after the
time of closest approach to the FR axis. We emphasize the importance of finding
simultaneously the FR axis direction and the location of the boundaries
corresponding to a balanced magnetic flux, so as to minimize the bias on the
deduced FR axis orientation. This method can also define an inner flux-balanced
sub-FR. We show that the MV results are much less biased when a compromise in
size of this sub-FR is achieved. For weakly asymmetric field temporal profiles,
the improved MV provides a very good determination of the FR axis orientation.
The main remaining bias is moderate (lower than 6 degrees) and is present
mostly on the angle between the flux rope axis and the plane perpendicular to
the Sun-Earth direction.

constructed, which can be used to study the spatial distribution of galaxies in
the low-$z$ Universe. These mock catalogs are used to quantify the cosmic
variance in the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) measured from the SDSS
survey. The GSMF estimated from the SDSS magnitude-limited sample can be
affected significantly by the presence of the under-dense region at $z<0.03$,
so that the low-mass end of the function can be underestimated significantly.
Several existing methods designed to deal with the effects of the cosmic
variance in the estimate of GSMF are tested, and none is found to be able to
fully account for the cosmic variance. We propose a method based on the
conditional stellar mass functions in dark matter halos, which can provide an
unbiased estimate of the global GSMF. The application of the method to the SDSS

simultaneously fitting SEDs of millions of galaxies across a wide redshift
range to obtain homogeneous estimates of the main physical parameters of
detected IR galaxies. We perform SED fitting on the UV/NIR to FIR emission of
42 047 galaxies from the pilot HELP field: ELAIS N1. We use the latest release
of CIGALE, a galaxy SED fitting code relying on energy balance, to deliver the
main physical parameters such as $M_{star}$, SFR, and $L_{dust}$. We implement
additional quality criteria to the fits by calculating $\chi^2$ values for the
stellar and dust part of the spectra independently. These criteria allow us to
identify the best fits and to identify peculiar galaxies. We perform the SED
fitting by assuming three different dust attenuation laws separately allowing
us to test the impact of the assumed law on estimated physical parameters. We
implemented two additional quality value checks for the SED fitting method
based on $M_{star}$ estimation and energy budget. This method allows us to
identify possible objects with incorrect matching in the catalogue and peculiar
galaxies; we found 351 possible candidates of lensed galaxies using two
complementary $\chi^2$s criteria (stellar and IR) and $z_{phot}$ calculated for
the IR part of the spectrum only. We find that the attenuation law has an
important impact on the $M_{star}$ estimate (on average leading to disparities
of a factor of two). We derive the relation between $M_{star}$ estimates
obtained by different attenuation laws and we find the best recipe for our

applications. This paper presents a room-level indoor localization approach
based on the measured room's echos in response to a two-millisecond single-tone
inaudible chirp emitted by a smartphone's loudspeaker. Different from other
acoustics-based room recognition systems that record full-spectrum audio for up
to ten seconds, our approach records audio in a narrow inaudible band for 0.1
seconds only to preserve the user's privacy. However, the short-time and
narrowband audio signal carries limited information about the room's
characteristics, presenting challenges to accurate room recognition. This paper
applies deep learning to effectively capture the subtle fingerprints in the
rooms' acoustic responses. Our extensive experiments show that a two-layer
convolutional neural network fed with the spectrogram of the inaudible echos
achieve the best performance, compared with alternative designs using other raw
data formats and deep models. Based on this result, we design a RoomRecognize
cloud service and its mobile client library that enable the mobile application
developers to readily implement the room recognition functionality without
resorting to any existing infrastructures and add-on hardware.
  Extensive evaluation shows that RoomRecognize achieves 99.7%, 97.7%, 99%, and
89% accuracy in differentiating 22 and 50 residential/office rooms, 19 spots in
a quiet museum, and 15 spots in a crowded museum, respectively. Compared with
the state-of-the-art approaches based on support vector machine, RoomRecognize
significantly improves the Pareto frontier of recognition accuracy versus
robustness against interfering sounds (e.g., ambient music).

presence of periodically modulated chemical potentials and connect them to the
FBCs occurring in a two-dimensional electron gas in the presence of a
perpendicular magnetic field in the integer quantum Hall effect (QHE) regime.
First, we show that in nanowires the FBCs take fractional values and change
linearly as a function of phase offset of the modulated chemical potential.
This linear slope takes quantized values determined by the period of the
modulation and depends only on the number of the filled bands. Next, we
establish a mapping from the one-dimensional system to the QHE setup, where we
again focus on the properties of the FBCs. By considering a cylinder topology
with an external flux similar to the Laughlin construction, we find that the
slope of the FBCs as function of flux is linear and assumes universal quantized
values, also in the presence of arbitrary disorder. We establish that the
quantized slopes give rise to the quantization of the Hall conductance.
Importantly, the approach via FBCs is valid for arbitrary flux values and
disorder. The slope of the FBCs plays the role of a topological invariant for
clean and disordered QHE systems. Our predictions for the FBCs can be tested
experimentally in nanowires and in Corbino disk geometries in the integer QHE
regime.

this study, we show that the non-homogeneous coefficient $|x|^{\sigma}$ has a
strong influence on the blow up behavior of the solutions. First of all, it
follows that finite time blow up occurs for self-similar solutions $u$, a
feature that does not appear in the well known autonomous case $\sigma=0$.
Moreover, we show that there are three different types of blow up self-similar
profiles, depending on whether the exponent $\sigma$ is closer to zero or not.
We also find an explicit blow up profile. The results show in particular that
\emph{global blow up} occurs when $\sigma>0$ is sufficiently small, while for
$\sigma>0$ sufficiently large blow up \emph{occurs only at infinity}, and we
give prototypes of these phenomena in form of self-similar solutions with
precise behavior. This work is a part of a larger program of understanding the

  Correspondence","Accepted in ECCV-W; Code available at this http url:
  https://github.com/val-iisc/pose_estimation",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding the geometry and pose of objects in 2D images is a fundamental
necessity for a wide range of real world applications. Driven by deep neural
networks, recent methods have brought significant improvements to object pose
estimation. However, they suffer due to scarcity of keypoint/pose-annotated
real images and hence can not exploit the object's 3D structural information
effectively. In this work, we propose a data-efficient method which utilizes
the geometric regularity of intraclass objects for pose estimation. First, we
learn pose-invariant local descriptors of object parts from simple 2D RGB
images. These descriptors, along with keypoints obtained from renders of a
fixed 3D template model are then used to generate keypoint correspondence maps
for a given monocular real image. Finally, a pose estimation network predicts
3D pose of the object using these correspondence maps. This pipeline is further
extended to a multi-view approach, which assimilates keypoint information from
correspondence sets generated from multiple views of the 3D template model.
Fusion of multi-view information significantly improves geometric comprehension
of the system which in turn enhances the pose estimation performance.
Furthermore, use of correspondence framework responsible for the learning of
pose invariant keypoint descriptor also allows us to effectively alleviate the
data-scarcity problem. This enables our method to achieve state-of-the-art
performance on multiple real-image viewpoint estimation datasets, such as
Pascal3D+ and ObjectNet3D. To encourage reproducible research, we have released
the codes for our proposed approach.

quantum gravity and also in quantum foundations once considering laboratories
as physical systems. Both fields thereby face the question of how to describe
physics relative to quantum reference systems and how the descriptions relative
to different such choices are related. Here, we exploit a fruitful interplay of
ideas from both fields to begin developing a unifying approach to
transformations among quantum reference systems that ultimately aims at
encompassing both quantum and gravitational physics. In particular, using a
gravity inspired symmetry principle, which enforces physical observables to be
relational and leads to an inherent redundancy in the description, we develop a
perspective-neutral structure, which contains all frame perspectives at once
and via which they are changed. We show that taking the perspective of a
specific frame amounts to a fixing of the symmetry related redundancies in both
the classical and quantum theory and that changing perspective corresponds to a
symmetry transformation. We implement this using the language of constrained
systems, which naturally encodes symmetries. Within a simple one-dimensional
model, we recover some of the quantum frame transformations of
arXiv:1712.07207, embedding them in a perspective-neutral framework. Using
them, we illustrate how entanglement and classicality of an observed system
depend on the quantum frame perspective. Our operational language also inspires
a new interpretation of Dirac and reduced quantized theories within our model
as perspective-neutral and perspectival quantum theories, respectively, and
reveals the explicit link between them. In this light, we suggest a new take on
the relation between a `quantum general covariance' and the diffeomorphism
symmetry in quantum gravity.

real-world systems such as power grid networks, social networks as well as
neuronal networks. We investigate a paradigmatic system of adaptively coupled
phase oscillators inspired by neuronal networks with synaptic plasticity. One
important behaviour of such systems reveals splitting of the network into
clusters of oscillators with the same frequencies, where different clusters
correspond to different frequencies. Starting from one-cluster solutions we
provide existence criteria for multi-cluster solutions and present their
explicit form. The phases of the oscillators within one cluster can be
organized in different patterns: antipodal, double antipodal, and splay type.
Interestingly, multi-clusters are shown to exist where different clusters
exhibit different patterns. For instance, an antipodal cluster can coexist with
a splay cluster. We also provide stability conditions for one- and
multi-cluster solutions. These conditions, in particular, reveal a high level
of multistability.

image forensics with an upsurge of digitally altered images which are
constantly being shared through websites, media, and social applications. But,
the task of identification becomes quite challenging if metadata are absent
from the image and/or if the image has been post-processed. In this paper, we
present a DenseNet pipeline to solve the problem of identifying the source
camera-model of an image. Our approach is to extract patches of 256*256 from a
labeled image dataset and apply augmentations, i.e., Empirical Mode
Decomposition (EMD). We use this extended dataset to train a Neural Network
with the DenseNet-201 architecture. We concatenate the output features for 3
different sizes (64*64, 128*128, 256*256) and pass them to a secondary network
to make the final prediction. This strategy proves to be very robust for
identifying the source camera model, even when the original image is
post-processed. Our model has been trained and tested on the Forensic
Camera-Model Identification Dataset provided for the IEEE Signal Processing
(SP) Cup 2018. During testing we achieved an overall accuracy of 98.37%, which
is the current state-of-the-art on this dataset using a single model. We used
transfer learning and tested our model on the Dresden Database for Camera Model
Identification, with an overall test accuracy of over 99% for 19 models. In
addition, we demonstrate that the proposed pipeline is suitable for other
image-forensic classification tasks, such as, detecting the type of
post-processing applied to an image with an accuracy of 96.66% -- which

variations in deformation mechanisms of Cu nanowires as a function of

different crystallographic orientations distributed uniformly on the standard
stereographic triangle have been considered under tensile and compressive
loading. The simulation results indicate that under compressive loading, the
orientations close to $<$100$>$ corner deform by twinning mechanism, while the
remaining orientations deform by dislocation slip. On the other hand, all the
nanowires deform by twinning mechanism under tensile loading. Further, the
orientations close to $<$110$>$ and $<$111$>$ corner exhibit
tension-compression asymmetry in deformation mechanisms. In addition to
deformation mechanisms, Cu nanowires also display tension-compression asymmetry
in yield stress. The orientations close to $<$001$>$ corner exhibits higher
yield stress in tension than in compression, while the opposite behaviour
(higher yield stress in compression than in tension) has been observed in
orientations close to $<$110$>$ and $<$111$>$ corners. For the specific
orientation of $<$102$>$, the yield stress asymmetry has not been observed. The
tension-compression asymmetry in deformation mechanisms has been explained
based on the parameter $\alpha_M$, defined as the ratio of Schmid factors for
leading and trailing partial dislocations. Similarly, the asymmetry in yield
stress values has been attributed to the different Schmid factor values for
leading partial dislocations under tensile and compressive loading.

successfully trigger multi-wavelength observations of transients, CTA has to be
able to alert other observatories as quickly as possible. Multi-wavelength
observations are essential for gaining insights into the processes occurring
within these sources of such high energy radiation. CTA will consist of
approximately 100 telescopes of different sizes and designs. Images are
streamed from all the telescopes into a central computing facility on site.
During observation CTA will produce a stream of up to 20 000 images per second.
Noise suppression and feature extraction algorithms are applied to each image
in the stream as well as previously trained machine learning models. Restricted
computing power of a single machine and the limits of network's data transfer
rates become a bottleneck for stream processing systems in a traditional
single-machine setting. We explore several different distributed streaming

code base while executing on different streaming engines we employ abstraction
layers such as the streams-framework. These use a high level language to build
up processing pipelines that can transformed into the native pipelines of the
different platforms. Here we present results of our investigation and show a

is attacked by updating the latent variables using gradient information.
{Besides, with pre-trained generative models, Type I attack on latent spaces is
investigated as well.} Experimental results show that our method is practical
and effective to generate Type I adversarial examples on large-scale image
datasets. Most of these generated examples can pass detectors designed for
defending Type II attack and the strengthening strategy is only efficient with
a specific type attack, both implying that the underlying reasons for Type I

changing the magnitude and the orientation of the electric field, the gap size

first main result establishes that, for a class of models for polymer-chain

hyperelastic model in continuum mechanics. In particular, the discrete
Helmholtz free energy of the network converges to the infimum of a continuum
integral functional (of an energy density depending only on the local
deformation gradient) and the discrete Gibbs measure converges (in the sense of
a large deviation principle) to a measure supported on minimizers of the
integral functional. Our second main result establishes the small temperature
limit of the obtained continuum model (provided the discrete Hamiltonian is
itself independent of the temperature), and shows that it coincides with the
$\Gamma$-limit of the discrete Hamiltonian, thus showing that thermodynamic and
small temperature limits commute. We eventually apply these general results to
a standard model of polymer physics from which we derive nonlinear elasticity.
We moreover show that taking the $\Gamma$-limit of the Hamiltonian is a good

large number of monomers per polymer-chain (which turns out to play the role of
an effective inverse temperature in the analysis).

the blazar TXS 0506+056 by an investigation of $9.5$ years of IceCube data,
while the blazar was in a quiescent state during the outburst with a gamma-ray
flux only about one-fifth of the neutrino flux. In this work, we give a
possible interpretation of the abnormal feature by proposing that the neutrino
outburst originates from the interaction between a relativistic jet and a dense
gas cloud formed via the tidally disrupted envelope of a red giant being blown
apart by the impact of the jet. Gamma-ray photons and electron/positron pairs
that are produced through the hadronuclear interactions correspondingly will
induce electromagnetic cascades and then make the cloud ionized and
thermalized. The EM radiation from jet-cloud/star interaction is mainly
contributed by the relatively low-energy relativistic protons which propagate
in the diffusion regime inside the cloud due to magnetic deflections, whereas
the observed high-energy neutrinos ($\gtrsim 100\,\rm TeV$) are produced by the
relatively high-energy protons which can keep beamed owing to the weak magnetic
deflections, inducing a much higher flux of neutrinos than electromagnetic
radiation. The observed low-energy electromagnetic radiations during the
neutrino outburst period are almost as same as that in the quiescent state of
the source, so it may mainly arise as same as the general quiescent state. As a
result, due to the intrusion of a dense cloud, the neutrino outburst can be
expected, and in the meantime, the accompanying electromagnetic radiations from
hadronic processes will not cause any enhancement in the blazar's
electromagnetic flux.

perform extensive numerical simulations of the original network of QIF neurons,
and determine the relation between the macroscopic and microscopic states for

to a large extent. For excitatory coupling, the phase diagram is remarkably
similar to that of the Kuramoto model with time delays, although here the

unveils the presence of various partially synchronized states not present in

the band structure information. Geometrically, the HHG signal is sensitive to
spatial orientations of monolayers. Different from the optical counterpart, the
spin HHG, though probably weak, only appears at even orders, a consequence of
SU(2) symmetry. Our findings open an unexplored frontier -- magneto-high-order
harmonic generation.

structure, consisting of the outer galaxy, an embedded disc within a radius of
$\sim60$ arcsec, and a kinematically decoupled core (KDC) with a radius of less
than 30arcsec. However, the size of the KDC and the amplitude of the kinematic
misalignment it induces have not yet been determined. In this paper, we explore
the properties of the KDC using observations from the MUSE Integral Field
Spectrograph to map out the kinematics in the central arcminute of NGC 1407.
Velocity and kinemetry maps of the galaxy reveal a twist of $\sim$148 degree in
the central $10$ arcseconds of the galaxy, and the higher-order moments of the
kinematics reveal that within the same region, this slowly-rotating galaxy
displays no net rotation. Analysis of the stellar populations across the galaxy
found no evidence of younger stellar populations in the region of the KDC,
instead finding uniform age and super-solar $\alpha$-enhancement across the
galaxy, and a smoothly decreasing metallicity gradient with radius. We
therefore conclude that NGC 1407 contains a triaxial, kiloparsec-scale KDC with
distinct kinematics relative to the rest of the galaxy, and which is likely to
have formed through either a major merger or a series of minor mergers early in
the lifetime of the galaxy. With a radius of $\sim$5 arcseconds or $\sim0.6$
kpc, NGC 1407 contains the smallest KDC mapped by MUSE to date in terms of both
its physical and angular size.

  Watermarking Techniques","7 pages, 4 figures, 1 table",,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep neural networks have had enormous impact on various domains of computer
science, considerably outperforming previous state of the art machine learning
techniques. To achieve this performance, neural networks need large quantities
of data and huge computational resources, which heavily increases their
construction costs. The increased cost of building a good deep neural network
model gives rise to a need for protecting this investment from potential
copyright infringements. Legitimate owners of a machine learning model want to
be able to reliably track and detect a malicious adversary that tries to steal
the intellectual property related to the model. Recently, this problem was
tackled by introducing in deep neural networks the concept of watermarking,
which allows a legitimate owner to embed some secret information(watermark) in
a given model. The watermark allows the legitimate owner to detect copyright
infringements of his model. This paper focuses on verifying the robustness and
reliability of state-of- the-art deep neural network watermarking schemes. We
show that, a malicious adversary, even in scenarios where the watermark is
difficult to remove, can still evade the verification by the legitimate owners,
thus avoiding the detection of model theft.

totally unexpected position of the mass-losing AGB star (QX Pup) relative to
the large-scale outflow. QX Pup is enshrouded within a compact (<60 AU) parcel
of dust and gas (clump S) in expansion (V~5-7 km/s) that is displaced by
0.6arcsec to the south of the dense equatorial region (or waist) where the
bipolar lobes join. Our SiO maps disclose a compact bipolar outflow that
emerges from QX Pup's vicinity. This outflow is oriented similarly to the
large-scale nebula but the expansion velocities are about ten times lower (~35
km/s). We deduce short kinematical ages for the SiO outflow, ranging from
~50-80 yr, in regions within ~150 AU, to ~400-500 yr at the lobe tips (~3500
AU). Adjacent to the SiO outflow, we identify a small-scale hourglass-shaped
structure (mini-hourglass) that is probably made of compressed ambient material
formed as the SiO outflow penetrates the dense, central regions of the nebula.
The lobes and the equatorial waist of the mini-hourglass are both radially
expanding with a constant velocity gradient. The mini-waist is characterized by
extremely low velocities, down to ~1 km/s at ~150 AU, which tentatively suggest
the presence of a stable structure. (abridged)

O $2p$ levels indirectly exchange-split by the interaction with Eu nearest
neighbors. Our temperature-dependent spin-ARPES data directly demonstrates the
exchange splitting in O $2p$ and its vanishing at the Curie temperature. Our
calculations with a Hubbard $U$ term reveal a complex nature of the local
exchange splitting on the oxygen site and in conduction bands. We discuss the
mechanisms of the indirect exchange in the O 2p levels by analyzing
orbital-resolved band characters in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases.
The directional effects due to spin-orbit coupling are predicted theoretically
to be significant in particular in the Eu 4f band manifold. The analysis of the
shape of spin-resolved spectra in the Eu $4f$ spectral region reveals
signatures of hybridization with O $2p$, in agreement with the theoretical
predictions. We also analyze spectral changes in the spin-integrated spectra

behavior of self-driven bacteria and colloidal particles in nematic liquid
crystals. Correspondingly, we study theoretically the dynamics of a minimal
model microswimmer in a uniaxially anisotropic fluid. As a first step, the
hydrodynamic Green's function providing the resulting fluid flow in response to
a localized force acting on the anisotropic fluid is derived analytically. On
this basis, the behavior of both puller- and pusher-type microswimmers in the
anisotropic fluid is analyzed. Depending on the propulsion mechanism and the
relative magnitude of different involved viscosities, we find alignment of the
swimmers parallel or perpendicular to the anisotropy axis. Particularly, also
an oblique alignment is identified under certain circumstances. The observed
swimmer reorientation results from the hydrodynamic coupling between the
self-induced fluid flow and the anisotropy of the surrounding fluid, which
distorts the self-generated flow field. We support parts of our results by a
simplified linear stability analysis. Our theoretical predictions are in
qualitative agreement with recent experimental observations on swimming
bacteria in nematic liquid crystals. They support the objective of utilizing
the, possibly switchable, anisotropy of a host fluid to guide individual
microswimmers and active particles along a requested path, enabling controlled
active transport.

is very difficult to construct and optimize a group of learning functions, and

distribution P(x) (where x is an instance) is changed. To resolve this problem,
the semantic information G theory, Logical Bayesian Inference (LBI), and a
group of Channel Matching (CM) algorithms together form a systematic solution.
A semantic channel in the G theory consists of a group of truth functions or
membership functions. In comparison with likelihood functions, Bayesian
posteriors, and Logistic functions used by popular methods, membership
functions can be more conveniently used as learning functions without the above
problem. In Logical Bayesian Inference (LBI), every label's learning is
independent. For Multilabel learning, we can directly obtain a group of
optimized membership functions from a big enough sample with labels, without
preparing different samples for different labels. A group of Channel Matching
(CM) algorithms is developed for machine learning. For the Maximum Mutual
Information (MMI) classification of three classes with Gaussian distributions
on a two-dimensional feature space, 2-3 iterations can make mutual information
between three classes and three labels surpass 99% of the MMI for most initial
partitions. For mixture models, the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is
improved and becomes the CM-EM algorithm, which can outperform the EM algorithm
when mixture ratios are imbalanced, or local convergence exists. The CM
iteration algorithm needs to combine neural networks for MMI classifications on
high-dimensional feature spaces. LBI needs further studies for the unification
of statistics and logic.

valuable methods for improved assessment of a range of diseases. Due to the
need to image an anatomic structure multiple times, parameter mapping usually
requires long scan times compared to conventional static imaging. Therefore,
accelerated parameter mapping is highly-desirable and remains a topic of great
interest in the MR research community. While many recent deep learning methods
have focused on highly efficient image reconstruction for conventional static
MR imaging, applications of deep learning for dynamic imaging and in particular
accelerated parameter mapping have been limited. The purpose of this work was
to develop and evaluate a novel deep learning-based reconstruction framework
called Model-Augmented Neural neTwork with Incoherent k-space Sampling (MANTIS)
for efficient MR parameter mapping. Our approach combines end-to-end CNN
mapping with k-space consistency using the concept of cyclic loss to further
enforce data and model fidelity. Incoherent k-space sampling is used to improve
reconstruction performance. A physical model is incorporated into the proposed
framework, so that the parameter maps can be efficiently estimated directly
from undersampled images. The performance of MANTIS was demonstrated for the
spin-spin relaxation time (T2) mapping of the knee joint. Compared to
conventional reconstruction approaches that exploited image sparsity, MANTIS
yielded lower errors and higher similarity with respect to the reference in the
T2 estimation. Our study demonstrated that the proposed MANTIS framework, with
a combination of end-to-end CNN mapping, signal model-augmented data
consistency, and incoherent k-space sampling, represents a promising approach
for efficient MR parameter mapping. MANTIS can potentially be extended to other
types of parameter mapping with appropriate models.

of (non)existence of ``hidden variables'' that determine the outcomes of all

Thus, arguments have been offered that C2 may have nothing to do with C1, and
the traditional formulation of C1 itself encounters difficulties when
measurement outcomes in a contextual system are treated as random variables. I
show that if C1 is formulated within the framework of the

the core mathematical tool of CbD, subsumes both counterfactual values and
``hidden variables''. In the latter case, a coupling itself can be viewed as a
