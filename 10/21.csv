become a serious liability as dimension increases. Alternative methods for
constructing convergence rate bounds (with respect to total variation distance)

substantially more robust to increasing dimension than those based on d&m. The

the reorganization of brain activity and connectivity. It remains unknown
whether activity and connectivity differentially reorganize during learning,

across distinct brain areas. Here, we address this gap in knowledge by
measuring brain activity and functional connectivity in a longitudinal fMRI
experiment in which healthy adult human participants learn the values of novel
objects over the course of four days. An increasing similarity in activity or
functional connectivity across subjects during learning reflects reorganization
toward a common functional architecture. We assessed the presence of
reorganization in activity and connectivity both during value learning and
during the resting-state, allowing us to differentiate common elicited
processes from intrinsic processes. We found a complex and dynamic
reorganization of brain connectivity and activity--as a function of time,
space, and performance--that occurs while subjects learn. Spatially localized
brain activity reorganizes across the brain to a common functional architecture
early in learning, and this reorganization tracks early learning performance.
In contrast, spatially distributed connectivity reorganizes across the brain to
a common functional architecture as training progresses, and this
reorganization tracks later learning performance. Particularly good performance
is associated with a sticky connectivity, that persists into the resting state.
Broadly, our work uncovers distinct principles of reorganization in activity
and connectivity at different phases of value learning, which inform the
ongoing study of learning processes more generally.

supernova events. If BLRs have a flat geometry and NLS1s are seen face-on then
we have to see CL cases only if the orientation of the BLR changes as a result

hits the sensor. These methods often require movement of some portion of the
imaging apparatus or only acquire images up to the resolution of a modulating
element. Here a technique is presented for resolving beyond the resolutions of
both a pointwise-modulating mask element and a sensor array through the
introduction of a controlled blur into the optical pathway. The analysis
contains an intuitive and exact expression for the overall superresolvability
of the system, and arguments are presented to explain how the combination of
random coding and blurring makes the superresolution problem well-posed.
Experimental results demonstrate that a resolution enhancement of approximately

anisotropic substrates, are investigated. A special class of hyperbolic
metasurfaces is considered in details and is shown to be beneficial for
achieving strong optical pulling forces in a broad spectral range. Spectral
decomposition of the Green functions enables identifying contributions of
different interaction channels and underlines the importance of the hyperbolic
dispersion regime, which plays the key role in optomechanical interactions.
Homogenised model of the hyperbolic metasurface is compared to its
metal-dielectric multilayer realizations and is shown to predict the

inflation. Inspired by recent works, we elaborate further on the possibility of
significant primordial tensor non-Gaussianities sourced by extra fields during
inflation. Unitarity constraints limit the impact of extra (spinning) particle
content by means of a lower bound on the corresponding mass spectrum. For
spin-2 particles, this takes the form of the well-known Higuchi bound. Massive
($m\gtrsim H$) particles will typically decay during inflation unless they are
non-minimally coupled to the inflaton sector: the inflating field ""lifts"" the
dynamics of the extra field(s), effectively getting around the limits imposed
by unitarity. There exist several models that realize such a mechanism, but we
focus here on the set-up of [1] where, through an EFT approach, one is able to
capture the essential features common to an entire class of theories. In the
presence of an extra massive spin-2 particle, the interactions in the tensor
sector mimic very closely those in the scalar sector of quasi-single-field
inflationary models. We calculate the tensor bispectrum in different
configurations and extract its dependence on the extra tensor sound speed. We
show in detail how one may obtain significant tensor non-Gaussianities whose
shape-function interpolates between local and equilateral, depending on the
mass of the extra field. We also estimate the LISA response functions to a
tensor bispectrum supporting the intermediate-type shapes we find.

increasing demand for hardware platforms that are computationally powerful, yet
energy-efficient. Due to the amount of data parallelism in these algorithms,
high-performance 3D manycore platforms that incorporate both CPUs and GPUs
present a promising direction. However, as systems use heterogeneity (e.g., a
combination of CPUs, GPUs, and accelerators) to improve performance and
efficiency, it becomes more pertinent to address the distinct and likely
conflicting communication requirements (e.g., CPU memory access latency or GPU
network throughput) that arise from such heterogeneity. Unfortunately, it is
difficult to quickly explore the hardware design space and choose appropriate
tradeoffs between these heterogeneous requirements. To address these
challenges, we propose the design of a 3D Network-on-Chip (NoC) for
heterogeneous manycore platforms that considers the appropriate design
objectives for a 3D heterogeneous system and explores various tradeoffs using
an efficient ML-based multi-objective optimization technique. The proposed
design space exploration considers the various requirements of its
heterogeneous components and generates a set of 3D NoC architectures that
efficiently trades off these design objectives. Our findings show that by
jointly considering these requirements (latency, throughput, temperature, and
energy), we can achieve 9.6% better Energy-Delay Product on average at nearly
iso-temperature conditions when compared to a thermally-optimized design for 3D
heterogeneous NoCs. More importantly, our results suggest that our 3D NoCs
optimized for a few applications can be generalized for unknown applications as
well. Our results show that these generalized 3D NoCs only incur a 1.8%

public health surveillance targets and policies. However, current research
relying on image-based data often relies on hand coding of images which is time
consuming and costly, ultimately limiting the scope of the study. Current best
practices in automated image classification (e.g., support vector machine

limited in their capacity to accurately distinguish between objects within
images. Objective: This study demonstrates how convolutional neural network
(CNN) can be used to extract unique features within an image and how SVM can
then be used to classify the image. Methods: Images of waterpipes or hookah (an
emerging tobacco product possessing similar harms to that of cigarettes) were
collected from Instagram and used in analyses (n=840). CNN was used to extract
unique features from images identified to contain waterpipes. A SVM classifier
was built to distinguish between images with and without waterpipes. Methods
for image classification were then compared to show how a CNN + SVM classifier
could improve accuracy. Results: As the number of the validated training images
increased, the total number of extracted features increased. Additionally, as
the number of features learned by the SVM classifier increased, the average
level of accuracy increased. Overall, 99.5% of the 420 images classified were
correctly identified as either hookah or non-hookah images. This level of
accuracy was an improvement over earlier methods that used SVM, CNN or Bag of
Features (BOF) alone. Conclusions: CNN extracts more features of the images
allowing a SVM classifier to be better informed, resulting in higher accuracy
compared with methods that extract fewer features. Future research can use this
method to grow the scope of image-based studies.

biofilms taken from two donors were exposed to the three antibacterial
solutions (irrigants) for 10 minutes, respectively. We observe that (a) live
bacterial cell ratios decline for a week after the exposure and the trend
reverses beyond a week; after fifteen weeks, live bacterial cell ratios in
biofilms fully return to their pretreatment levels; (b) NaOCl is shown as the
strongest antibacterial agent for the oral biofilms; (c) multispecies oral
biofilms from different donors showed no difference in their susceptibility to
all the bacterial solutions. Guided by the experiment, a mathematical model for
biofilm dynamics is developed, accounting for multiple bacterial phenotypes,
quorum sensing, and growth factor proteins, to describe the nonlinear time
evolutionary behavior of the biofilms. The model captures time evolutionary
dynamics of biofilms before and after antibacterial treatment very well. It
reveals the crucial role played by quorum sensing molecules and growth factors

strongly influenced by spatial heterogeneity and stochasticity. A key challenge
when modelling such processes using stochastic random walk frameworks is that
negative jump coefficients can arise when transport operators are discretized
on heterogeneous domains. Often this is dealt with through homogenization
approximations by replacing the heterogeneous medium with an
$\textit{effective}$ homogeneous medium. In this work, we present a new class
of homogenization approximations by considering a stochastic diffusive
transport model on a one-dimensional domain containing an arbitrary number of
layers with different jump rates. We derive closed form solutions for the $k$th
moment of particle lifetime, carefully explaining how to deal with the internal
interfaces between layers. These general tools allow us to derive simple
formulae for the effective transport coefficients, leading to significant
generalisations of previous homogenization approaches. Here, we find that
different jump rates in the layers gives rise to a net bias, leading to a
non-zero advection, for the entire homogenized system. Example calculations
show that our generalized approach can lead to very different outcomes than
traditional approaches, thereby having the potential to significantly affect
simulation studies that use homogenization approximations.

crucial steps that can positively impact the global carbon balance. The capture
of CO2 has been difficult due to its extremely high stability. In this study,
we propose a simple and yet effective approach for capture and storage of CO2
by C6Li6. C6Li6 possesses a planar star-like structure, whose ionization energy
is lower than that of Li atom and hence, it behaves as a superalkali.
Superalkalis are unusual species possessing lower ionization energies than
alkali atoms. We have systematically studied the interaction of successive CO2
molecules with C6Li6 using long-range dispersion corrected density functional
{\omega}B97xD/6-311+G(d) calculations. We notice that these interactions lead
to stable C6Li6-nCO2 complexes (n = 1-6) in which the structure of CO2 moieties
is bent appreciably (122-125deg) due to electron transfer from C6Li6, whose
planarity is distorted only slightly (less than or equal to 7 deg). This
clearly suggests that the CO2 molecules can successfully be activated and
captured by C6Li6. We have also analyzed bond-lengths and bond-angle of CO2,
their charges and adsorption energy as a function of the number of adsorbed CO2
(n). It has been also noticed that the bond-length of CO2 in C6Li6-nCO2
complexes increases monotonically whereas adsorption energy decreases, ranging
3.18-2.79 eV per CO2 with the increase in n. These findings not only establish
the potential of C6Li6 for capture and storage of CO2 molecules but also
provide new insights into CO2-activation, capture, and storage by systems
having low ionization energies.

steady dynamics can be realized in some well-defined discrete frequencies.
These frequencies are independent of the off-diagonal couplings. In this work,
we generalize this physics to the many-body seesaw realized using the tilted
Bose-Hubbard model. We find that the wave function will recover to its initial

level spacing between the ground and the first excited levels. The period is
determined by the driving frequency and commensurate ratio. In this case, the
wave function will almost be restricted to the lowest two instantaneous energy

dynamics is exactly the same as that for the spin precession dynamics and
nutation dynamics around an oscillating axis. We map out the corresponding
phase diagram and show that in the low-frequency regime the state is
thermalized and in the strong modulation limit, the dynamics is determined by
the effective Floquet Hamiltonian. The measurement of these dynamics from the
mean position and mean momentum in phase space are also discussed. Our results

researchers and practitioners within machine learning community in the last

very frequent. To construct predictive monotone models from those problems,
many classifiers require as input a data set satisfying the monotonicity
relationships among all samples. Changing the class labels of the data set
(relabelling) is useful for this. Relabelling is assumed to be an important
building block for the construction of monotone classifiers and it is proved
that it can improve the predictive performance.
  In this paper, we will address the construction of monotone datasets

For the first time in the specialized literature, we propose the use of noise
filtering algorithms in a preprocessing stage with a double goal: to increase
both the monotonicity index of the models and the accuracy of the predictions
for different monotonic classifiers. The experiments are performed over 12

heavy-tailed generalization of the multivariate normal (MN) distribution to
model elliptical contoured scatters in the presence of mild outliers, referred
to as ""bad"" points. The MCN can also automatically detect bad points. The price
of these advantages is two additional parameters, both with specific and useful
interpretations: proportion of good observations and degree of contamination.
However, points may be bad in some dimensions but good in others. The use of an
overall proportion of good observations and of an overall degree of
contamination is limiting. To overcome this limitation, we propose a multiple
scaled contaminated normal (MSCN) distribution with a proportion of good
observations and a degree of contamination for each dimension. Once the model
is fitted, each observation has a posterior probability of being good with
respect to each dimension. Thanks to this probability, we have a method for
simultaneous directional robust estimation of the parameters of the MN
distribution based on down-weighting and for the automatic directional
detection of bad points by means of maximum a posteriori probabilities. The
term ""directional"" is added to specify that the method works separately for
each dimension. Mixtures of MSCN distributions are also proposed as an
application of the proposed model for robust clustering. An extension of the EM
algorithm is used for parameter estimation based on the maximum likelihood
approach. Real and simulated data are used to show the usefulness of our
mixture with respect to well-established mixtures of symmetric distributions

its connection with the quasiparticle scattering interference are investigated
based on the framework of the kinetic-energy driven superconducting mechanism
by taking into account the pseudogap effect. It is shown that the octet
scattering model of the quasiparticle scattering processes with the scattering
wave vectors ${\bf q}_{i}$ connecting the hot spots on the constant energy
contours is intrinsically related to the emergence of the highly anisotropic
momentum-dependence of the pseudogap. Concomitantly, the sharp peaks in the
autocorrelation of the quasiparticle excitation spectral intensities with the
wave vectors ${\bf q}_{i}$ are directly correlated to the regions of the
highest joint density of states. Moreover, the momentum-space structure of the
autocorrelation patterns of the quasiparticle excitation spectral intensities
is well consistent with the momentum-space structure of the quasiparticle
scattering interference patterns observed from Fourier-transform scanning
tunneling spectroscopy experiments. The theory therefore confirms an intimate

to investigate the global stellar mass - local stellar mass surface density -
gas-phase metallicity ($M_*$ - $\Sigma_*$ - $Z$ ) relation. At a fixed $M_*$,
the metallicity increases steeply with increasing $\Sigma_*$. Similarly, at a
fixed $\Sigma_*$, the metallicity increases strongly with increasing $M_*$ at
low mass end, while this trend becomes less obvious at high mass end. We find
the metallicity to be more strongly correlated to $\Sigma_*$ than to $M_*$.
Furthermore, we construct a tight (0.07 dex scatter) $M_*$ - $\Sigma_*$ - $Z$
relation, which reduces the scatter in the $\Sigma_*$ - $Z$ relation by about
30$\%$ for galaxies with $7.8 < {\rm log}(M_*/M_\odot) < 11.0$, while the
reduction of scatter is much weaker for high-mass galaxies. This result
suggests that, especially for low-mass galaxies, the $M_*$ - $\Sigma_*$ - $Z$
relation is largely more fundamental than the $M_*$ - $Z$ and $\Sigma_*$ - $Z$
relations, meaning that both $M_*$ and $\Sigma_*$ play important roles in
shaping the local metallicity. We also find that the local metallicity is
probably independent on the local star formation rate surface density at a
fixed $M_*$ and $\Sigma_*$. Our results are consistent with the scenario that
the local metallicities in galaxies are shaped by the combination of the local
stars formed in the history and the metal loss caused by galactic winds.

significant auroral $\rm [OIII]\lambda4363$ emission line ($\rm S/N \geq 3$).
With the electronic temperature metallicity calibration, we find nine SFGs are
extremely metal-poor galaxies with $\rm 12 + log(O/H) \leq 7.69 \ (1/10 \
Z_\odot)$. The metallicity of the most metal-deficient galaxy is $7.35\pm 0.09$
(about 1/20 $Z_{\odot}$). Compared with the SFGs with normal metallicities in
local and high redshift universe, our metal-poor SFGs have more than ten times
higher SFRs at a fixed stellar mass. We create a new mass -- SFR relation for
these metal-poor galaxies at $0.6<z<0.9$. Due to the higher SFRs and younger
stellar ages, our metal-poor SFGs deviate from the MZR and FMR in the local
universe toward lower metallicities, confirming the existence of FMR, as well
as the cosmic evolution of MZR and FMR with redshift.

work, in this paper, we further study how to localize single pulses using
astrometric solving method. Assuming that the burst is a point source, we
derive the burst position by solving a set of linear equations given the
relation between residual delay and offset to a priori position. We find that
the single pulse localization results given by both astrometric solving and
radio imaging are consistent within 3 sigma level. Therefore we claim that it
is possible to derive the position of a single pulse with reasonable precision
based on only 3 or even 2 baselines with 4 milliseconds integration. The
combination of cross spectrum based detection and the localization proposed in
this work then provide a thorough solution for searching single pulse in VLBI
observation. According to our calculation, our pipeline gives comparable
accuracy as radio imaging pipeline. Moreover, the computational cost of our
pipeline is much smaller, which makes it more practical for FRB search in

with high performance. In order to do that, a CDN measures the latency on the
paths from its servers to users and then selects a best available server for
each user. For large CDNs, monitoring paths from thousands of servers to
millions of users is a challenging task due to its size. In this paper, we
address this problem and propose a framework to scale the task of path
monitoring. Simply stated, the goal of our framework is clustering IP addresses
(clients) such that in each cluster the choice of best available server is same
(or similar). Then, finding a best available server for one client in a given
cluster will be sufficient to assign that server to the rest of the clients in
the cluster.
  To achieve this goal, first we introduce two distance metrics to compute how
similar the server choices of any given two clients. Second, we use a
clustering method that is based on interdomain routing information. We evaluate
the goodness of our clusters by using the metrics we introduce. We show that
there is a strong correlation between the similarity in how two destination
clients are routed to in the Internet and the similarity in their server
selections. Finally, we show how to choose representative clients from each
cluster so that it is sufficient to learn the latencies from the CDN servers to
the representative and find a best available server accordingly for the rest of
the clients in the same cluster.

Electromechanical coupling in OHCs, which enables these cells to convert
electrical energy into mechanical energy, has been analyzed in detail using
isolated cells using primarily static membrane models. In the preceding
reports, mechanical output of OHC was evaluated by developing a kinetic theory
based on a simplified one-dimensional (1D) model for OHCs. Here such a kinetic
description of OHCs is extended by using the membrane model, which has been
used for analyzing in vitro experiments. The present theory predicts, for
systems without inertial load, that elastic load enhances positive shift of
voltage dependence of the membrane capacitance due to turgor pressure. For
systems with inertia, mechanical power output also depends on turgor pressure.
The maximal power output is, however, similar to the previous prediction of up
to ~10 fW based on the 1D model.

the ordinary Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equation accounting for violent
relaxation and gravitational cooling. It involves a cubic nonlinearity taking
into account the self-interaction of the bosons, a logarithmic nonlinearity
associated with an effective temperature, and a source of dissipation. It leads
to superfluid dark matter halos with a core-halo structure. The quantum
potential or the self-interaction of the bosons generates a solitonic core that
solves the cusp problem of the cold dark matter model. The logarithmic
nonlinearity generates an isothermal atmosphere accounting for the flat
rotation curves of the galaxies. The dissipation ensures that the system
relaxes towards an equilibrium configuration. In the Thomas-Fermi
approximation, the dark matter halo is equivalent to a barotropic gas with an
equation of state $P=2\pi a_s\hbar^2\rho^2/m^3+\rho k_B T/m$, where $a_s$ is

TensorFlow and Caffe2. These frameworks employ a dataflow model where the NN
training is modeled as a directed graph composed of a set of nodes. Operations
in neural network training are typically implemented by the frameworks as
primitives and represented as nodes in the dataflow graph. Training NN models
in a dataflow-based machine learning framework involves a large number of
fine-grained operations. Those operations have diverse memory access patterns
and computation intensity. How to manage and schedule those operations is
challenging, because we have to decide the number of threads to run each
operation (concurrency control) and schedule those operations for good hardware
utilization and system throughput.
  In this paper, we extend an existing runtime system (the TensorFlow runtime)
to enable automatic concurrency control and scheduling of operations. We
explore performance modeling to predict the performance of operations with
various thread-level parallelism. Our performance model is highly accurate and
lightweight. Leveraging the performance model, our runtime system employs a set
of scheduling strategies that co-run operations to improve hardware utilization
and system throughput. Our runtime system demonstrates a big performance
benefit. Comparing with using the recommended configurations for concurrency
control and operation scheduling in TensorFlow, our approach achieves 33%
performance (execution time) improvement on average (up to 49%) for three

proposes a spatio-temporal correlation analysis approach for anomaly detection

feeder line in a distribution network is formulated and the spectrum of its
covariance matrix is analyzed. The spectrum is complex and exhibits two
aspects: 1) bulk, which arises from random noise or fluctuations and 2) spikes,
which represents factors caused by anomaly signals or fault disturbances. Then,
by connecting the estimation of the number of factors to the limiting empirical
spectral density of covariance matrices of residuals, the spatio-temporal
parameters are accurately estimated, during which free random variable
techniques are used. Based on the estimators, anomaly indicators are designed
to detect and locate the anomalies by exploring the variations of
spatio-temporal correlations in the data. The proposed approach is sensitive to
the anomalies and robust to random fluctuations, which makes it possible for
detecting early anomalies and reducing false alarming rate. Case studies on
both synthetic data and real-world online monitoring data verify the
effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach.

extension property for partial automorphisms). Our results can be seen as
evidence for the importance of studying the completion problem for amalgamation
classes and have some further applications (such as the stationary independence

living and abiotic systems that are far from equilibrium exhibit super
diffusive behavior at long times, which in some cases (for example evolving
tumor) is preceded by slow glass-like dynamics. By using the evolution of a
collection of tumor cells, driven by mechanical forces and subject to cell
birth and apoptosis, as a case study we show theoretically that on short time
scales the mean square displacement is sub-diffusive due to jamming, whereas at
long times it is super diffusive. The results obtained using stochastic
quantization method, which is needed because of the absence of
fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT), show that the super-diffusive behavior
is universal and impervious to the nature of cell-cell interactions.
Surprisingly, the theory also quantitatively accounts for the non-trivial
dynamics observed in simulations of a model soap foam characterized by creation
and destruction of spherical bubbles, which suggests that the two
non-equilibrium systems belong to the same universality class. The theoretical
prediction for the super diffusion exponent is in excellent agreement with
simulations for collective motion of tumor cells and dynamics associated with
soap bubbles.

formation (SF-arms) downstream from the potential of the oldest stars (P-arms),
resulting in a color jump from red to blue across spiral arms in the direction
of rotation, while aging of these newly formed young stars induces the opposite
but coexisting classic age gradient further downstream from the SF-arms. As the
techniques for measuring pitch angle are intensity-weighted, they trace both
the SF-arms and P-arms and are not sensitive to the classic age gradient.
Consequently, the measured pitch angle of spiral arms should be systematically
smaller in bluer bandpasses compared to redder bandpasses. We test these
predictions using a comprehensive sample of high-quality optical ($BVRI$)
images of bright, nearby spiral galaxies acquired as part of the
Carnegie-Irvine Galaxy Survey, supplemented by $Spitzer$ 3.6 $\mu m$ data to
probe evolved stars and $GALEX$ ultraviolet images to trace recent star
formation. We apply one-dimensional and two-dimensional techniques to measure
the pitch angle of spiral arms, paying close attention to adopt consistent
procedures across the different bandpasses to minimize error and systematic
bias. We find that the pitch angle of spiral arms decreases mildly but
statistically significantly from the reddest to the bluest bandpass,
demonstrating conclusively that young stars trace tighter spiral arms than old
stars. Furthermore, the correlation between the pitch angle of blue and red
bandpasses is non-linear, such that the absolute value of pitch angle offset
increases with increasing pitch angle. Both effects can be naturally explained
in the context of the density wave theory for spiral structure.

future memory systems. On the other side, unlike DRAM systems, NVMs can retain
data even after power loss and thus enlarge the attack surface. While data
encryption and integrity verification have been proposed earlier for DRAM
systems, protecting and recovering secure memories becomes more challenging
with persistent memory. Specifically, security metadata, e.g., encryption
counters and Merkle Tree data, should be securely persisted and recovered
across system reboots and during recovery from crashes. Not persisting updates
to security metadata can lead to data inconsistency, in addition to serious
security vulnerabilities.
  In this paper, we pioneer a new direction that explores persistency of both
Merkle Tree and encryption counters to enable secure recovery of
data-verifiable and encrypted memory systems. To this end, we coin a new
concept that we call Persistent-Security. We discuss the requirements for such
persistently secure systems, propose novel optimizations, and evaluate the
impact of the proposed relaxation schemes and optimizations on performance,
resilience and recovery time. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the
first to discuss the persistence of security metadata in integrity-protected
NVM systems and provide corresponding optimizations. We define a set of
relaxation schemes that bring trade-offs between performance and recovery time
for large capacity NVM systems. Our results show that our proposed design,
Triad-NVM, can improve the throughput by an average of ~2x (relative to strict
persistence). Moreover, Triad-NVM maintains a recovery time of less than 4
seconds for an 8TB NVM system (30.6 seconds for 64TB), which is ~3648x faster
than a system without security metadata persistence.

computational powers that can last from hours to days, making impossible to
create scalable and efficient ways of automatically classifying variable stars.
Also, light curves from different surveys cannot be integrated and analyzed
together when using features, because of observational differences. For
example, having variations in cadence and filters, feature distributions become
biased and require expensive data-calibration models. The vast amount of data
that will be generated soon make necessary to develop scalable machine learning
architectures without expensive integration techniques. Convolutional Neural

interdependent spatially embedded networks considers random failures. However,
recently research show that they are susceptible to geographically localized
attacks or failures cased by natural disasters or terrorist attacks, which
affect all nodes within a given radius. In particular, small localized attacks
may lead to catastrophic consequences. As a remedy of the collapse instability,
one research introduced a dynamic healing strategy and the possibility of new
connectivity link with a probability, called random healing, to bridge two
remaining neighbors of a failed node. The random strategy is straightforward.
Here, unlike previous strategy, we propose a simple but effective strategy,
called healing strategy by prioritizing minimum degree(HPMD), which
establishing a new link between two functioning neighbors with minimum degree
during the cascading failures. In addition, we consider the distance between
two nodes to avoid change the network structures. Afterwards, a comparison is
made between HPMD and three healing strategies: random, degree centrality and
local centrality to identify which a pair of neighbors have high priority.
Simulation experiments are presented for two square lattices with the same size
as interdependent spatially embedded networks under localized attacks. Results
demonstrated that HPMD strategy has an outstanding performance against
localized attacks, even when ratio of healing is vary. Moreover, HPMD is more
timely, more applicability and costless. Our method is meaningful in practice
as it can greatly enhance the resilience and robustness of interdependent
spatially embedded networks against localized attacks.

as a useful tool to improve the portfolio selection process, where nodes
indicate securities and edges capture the dependence structure of the system.
Three different methods are proposed in order to extract the dependence
structure between assets in a network context. Starting from this modified
structure, we formulate and then we solve the asset allocation problem. We find
that the portfolios obtained through a network-based approach are composed
mainly of peripheral assets, which are poorly connected with the others. These
portfolios, in the majority of cases, are characterized by an higher trade-off
between performance and risk with respect to the traditional Global Minimum
Variance (GMV) portfolio. Additionally, this methodology benefits of a
graphical visualization of the selected portfolio directly over the graphic
layout of the network, which helps in improving our understanding of the
optimal strategy.

known and investigated since the starting of array signal processing. Accurate
estimation of such parameter is critical in many applications that involve
prior knowledge of the number of received signals. Information theo- retic
approaches such as Akaikes information criterion (AIC) and minimum description
length (MDL) have been used extensively even though they are complex and show
bad performance at some stages. In this paper, a new algorithm for estimating
the number of sources is presented. This algorithm exploits the estimated
eigenvalues of the auto correlation coefficient matrix rather than the auto
covariance matrix, which is conventionally used, to estimate the number of
sources. We propose to use either of a two simply estimated decision
statistics, which are the moving increment and moving standard deviation as
metric to estimate the number of sources. Then process a simple calculation of
the increment or standard deviation of eigenvalues to find the number of
sources at the location of the maximum value. Results showed that our proposed
algorithms have a better performance in comparison to the popular and more
computationally expensive AIC and MDL at low SNR values and low number of
collected samples.

required in any receiver or communication systems. It can be computed either by
a pilot signal data-aided approach in which the transmitted signal would be
known to the receiver, or without any knowledge of the transmitted signal,
which is a non-data-aided (NDA) estimation approach. In this paper, a NDA SNR
estimation algorithm for QPSK signal is proposed. The proposed algorithm
modifies the existing Signal- to-Variation Ratio (SVR) SNR estimation algorithm
in the aim to reduce its bias and mean square error in case of negative SNR
values at low number of samples of it. We first present the existing SVR
algorithm and then show the mathematical derivation of the new NDA algorithm.
In addition, we compare our algorithm to two baselines estimation methods,
namely the M2M4 and SVR algorithms, using different test cases. Those test
cases include low SNR values, extremely high SNR values and low number of
samples. Results showed that our algorithm had a better performance compared to
second and fourth moment estimation (M2M4) and original SVR algorithms in terms
of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and bias estimation while keeping almost
the same complexity as the original algorithms

deploying network models on mobile devices with limited resources, weight
quantization has been widely adopted. Binary quantization obtains the highest
compression but usually results in big accuracy drop. In practice, 8-bit or
16-bit quantization is often used aiming at maintaining the same accuracy as
the original 32-bit precision. We observe different layers have different
accuracy sensitivity of quantization. Thus judiciously selecting different
precision for different layers/structures can potentially produce more
efficient models compared to traditional quantization methods by striking a
better balance between accuracy and compression rate. In this work, we propose
a fine-grained quantization approach for deep neural network compression by
relaxing the search space of quantization bitwidth from discrete to a
continuous domain. The proposed approach applies gradient descend based
optimization to generate a mixed-precision quantization scheme that outperforms
the accuracy of traditional quantization methods under the same compression
rate.

two optical modes and an electrically-driven acoustic mode, facilitates the

isolator. The co-guided and co-traveling arrangement enables isolation with no
additional optical loss, without magnetic-optic materials, and low power
consumption. The approach is theoretically evaluated and simulations predict
over 20 dB of isolation and 2.6 dB of insertion loss with 370 GHz optical

electrical drive power, an improvement of 1-3 orders of magnitude over the
