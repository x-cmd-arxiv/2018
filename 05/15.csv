1.9 over a period of 40 years. We have investigated physical mechanisms
responsible for the spectral change in Mrk 1018 by analyzing archival spectral
and imaging data. Two kinematically distinct broad-line components, blueshifted
and redshifted components, are found from spectral decomposition. The velocity
offset curve of the broad-line as a function of time shows a characteristic
pattern. An oscillating recoiled supermassive black hole (rSMBH) scenario is
proposed to explain the observed velocity offset in broad emission lines. A
Bayesian Markov-Chain Monte Carlo simulation is performed to derive the best
fit orbital parameters, we find that the rSMBH has a highly eccentric orbit
with a period of $\sim$29 years. The AGN activity traced by variation of broad
H$\beta$ emission line is found to increase and decrease rapidly at the start
and end of the cycle, and peaked twice at the start and near the end of the
cycle. Extinction at the start and end of the cycle (when its spectral type is
Type 1.9) is found to increase due to increased covering factor. Perturbations
of the accretion disk caused by pericentric passage can reasonably explain the
AGN activity and spectral change in Mrk 1018. Currently, the spectral type of
Mrk 1018 is Type 1.9, and we do not know if it will repeat a similar pattern of
spectral change in the future, but if it does, then spectral type will turn to
Type 1 around mid 2020's.

for the symmetric groups are related to the irreducible characters by a linear
relation that involves a unitriagular coupling matrix that gives the Frobenius
characters in terms of linear combinations of the irreducible characters. It is
desirable to invert this relationship since we have formulas for the Frobenius
characters and want the values for the irreducible characters. This inversion
is straightforward and yields both the irreducible characters but also the
coupling matrix that turns out to be the Kostka matrix in the original
direction. We show that if the Frobenius monomial identity is applied a
modification of it, equation (22), produces a monomial formula that produces
the Kostka matrix inverse without involving the characters of either type.
However it is a formidable task to execute this procedure for symmetric groups
of even modest order. Alternatively the inversion by means of the unitriangular
coupling matrix produces the Kostka matrix and the irreducible characters
simultaneously and with much less effort than required for the monomial
approach. Moreover there is a surprise.

studies concerning the rare class of radio loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies,
of which several hundred are currently known. According to the current AGN
paradigm, the low black hole masses and high accretion rates of narrow-line
Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLSy1) should make them unlikely to launch jets, and indeed
the vast majority ($\sim 90\%$) are very radio weak. The remainder, however,
display a wide range of radio power, from $\simeq 10^{21}$- $10^{28}$ W/Hz. In
this review I discuss recent radio imaging surveys that suggest there are three
main classes of NLSy1, which cannot be easily distinguished by the standard
radio-loudness parameter alone: (i) radio-weak NLSy1s without jets, (ii) mildly
radio-loud NLSy1s that are a mixture of star-forming and jet-dominant AGN, and
(iii) very radio loud NLSy1s with extreme properties similar to powerful
jet-dominated blazars. I present updated kinematics information from the MOJAVE
survey on six of the latter sources (all detected in gamma-rays by Fermi),
indicating high bulk Lorentz factors and small viewing angles in three cases.
Studies with the JVLA have shown that the jets of radio loud NLSy1s are likely
lower- power versions of classical radio galaxies, with typical lengths of less
than 10 kpc, although two very radio-loud NLSy1s have de-projected sizes of
several hundred kpc. I discuss the challenges of reconciling the heterogeneous
radio properties of NLSy1s with their strict optical line criteria, and
near-term prospects for the discovery of larger numbers of radio-loud NLSy1s.

suggested to be newly born fast rotating magnetars, which spin down mainly
through magnetic dipole radiation and gravitational wave emission. We calculate
the magnetar-powered SLSNe light curves (LCs) with the tilt angle evolution of
newly born magnetars involved. We show that, depending on the internal toroidal
magnetic fields ${\bar B}_{\rm t}$, the initial spin periods $P_{\rm i}$, and
the radii $R_{\rm DU}$ of direct Urca (DU) cores of newly born magnetars, as
well as the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$ for $^3P_2$ neutron superfluidity,
bumps could appear in the SLSNe LCs after the maximum lights when the tilt
angles grow to $\pi/2$. The value of $T_{\rm c}$ determines the arising time
and the relative amplitude of a bump. The quantity $R_{\rm DU}$ can affect the
arising time and the luminosity of a bump, as well as the peak luminosity of a
LC. Moreover, it is interesting that a stronger ${\bar B}_{\rm t}$ will lead to
both a brighter peak and a brighter bump in a LC. While keeping other
quantities unchanged, the bump in the LC disappears for the magnetar with
smaller $P_{\rm i}$. We suggest that, once the SLSNe LCs with such kinds of
bumps are observed, by fitting these LCs with our model, not only $B_{\rm d}$
and $P_{\rm i}$ of newly born magnetars but also the crucial physical
quantities ${\bar B}_{\rm t}$, $R_{\rm DU}$, and $T_{\rm c}$ could be
determined. Nonobservation of SLSNe LCs with such kinds of bumps hitherto may
already put some (\textit{though very rough}) constraints on ${\bar B}_{\rm

the mass distribution of stellar and substellar objects at birth, otherwise
known as the initial mass function (IMF). The model contains both deterministic
and stochastic elements, and provides a unified framework within which to view
the formation of brown dwarfs and stars resulting from an accretion process
that starts from extremely low mass seeds. It does not depend upon a top down
scenario of collapsing (Jeans) masses or an initial lognormal or otherwise
IMF-like distribution of seed masses. Like the modified lognormal power law
(MLP) distribution, the DPL distribution has a power law at the high mass end,
as a result of exponential growth of mass coupled with equally likely stopping
of accretion at any time interval. Unlike the MLP, a power law decay also
appears at the low mass end of the IMF. This feature is closely connected to
the accretion stopping probability rising from an initially low value up to a
high value. This might be associated with physical effects of ejections
sometimes (i.e., rarely) stopping accretion at early times followed by outflow
driven accretion stopping at later times, with the transition happening at a
critical time (therefore mass). Comparing the DPL to empirical data, the
critical mass is close to the substellar mass limit, suggesting that the onset
of nuclear fusion plays an important role in the subsequent accretion history
of a young stellar object.

  correction",,,,"math.RA math.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We initiate the study of expansions of monoids in the class of two-sided
restriction monoids and show that generalizations of the Birget-Rhodes prefix
group expansion, despite the absence of involution, have rich structure close
to that of respective relatively free inverse monoids.
  For a monoid $M$, we define ${\mathcal{FR}}_R(M)$ to be the freest two-sided
restriction monoid generated by a bijective copy, $M'$, of the underlying set
of $M$, such that the inclusion map $\iota\colon M\to {\mathcal{FR}}_R(M)$ is
determined by a set of relations, $R$, so that $\iota$ is a premorphism which
is weaker than a homomorphism. Our main result states that
${\mathcal{FR}}_R(M)$ can be constructed, by means of a partial action product
construction, from $M$ and the idempotent semilattice of ${\mathcal{FI}}_R(M)$,
the free $M'$-generated inverse monoid subject to relations $R$. In particular,
the semilattice of projections of ${\mathcal{FR}}_R(M)$ is isomorphic to the
idempotent semilattice of ${\mathcal{FI}}_R(M)$. The result by Fountain, Gomes
and Gould on the structure of the free two-sided restriction monoid is
recovered as a special case of our result.
  We show that important properties of ${\mathcal{FR}}_R(M)$ are well agreed
with suitable properties of $M$, such as being cancellative or embeddable into
a group. We observe that if $M$ is an inverse monoid, then
${\mathcal{FI}}_s(M)$, the free inverse monoid with respect to strong
premorphisms, is isomorphic to the Lawson-Margolis-Steinberg generalized prefix
expansion $M^{pr}$. This gives a presentation of $M^{pr}$ and leads to a model
for ${\mathcal{FR}}_s(M)$ in terms of the known model for $M^{pr}$.

of intense geomagnetic storms during the current solar cycle 24 in relation to
the previous cycle. This situation changed after mid-June 2015 when one of the
biggest solar active regions (AR 2371) of current solar cycle 24, close to the
central meridian produced several coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with
M-class flares. The CMEs impact on the Earth's magnetosphere resulted in a
moderately-severe G4-class geomagnetic storm on 22-23 June 2015 and a G2
(moderate) geomagnetic storms on 24 June. The G4 solstice storm was the second
biggest (so far) geomagnetic storms of cycle 24. We highlight the ground level
observations made by New-Tupi, Muonca and the CARPET El Leoncito cosmic ray
detectors that are located within the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region.
These observations are studied in correlation with data obtained by space-borne
detectors and other ground-based experiments. The CME designations are from the
Computer Aided CME Tracking (CACTus) automated catalog. As expected, Forbush
Decreases (FD) associated with the passing CMEs were recorded by these
detectors. We noticed a peculiar feature linked to a severe geomagnetic storm
event. The 21 June 2015 CME 0091 was likely associated with the 22 June summer
solstice FD event. The angular width of CME 0091 was very narrow and measured
56 degrees seen from Earth. In most cases, only CME halos and partial halos,
lead to severe geomagnetic storms. We performed a cross-check analysis of the
FD events detected during the rise phase of the current solar cycle 24, the
geomagnetic parameters, and the CACTus CME catalog. Our study suggests that
narrow angular-width CMEs that erupt in the western region of the ecliptic
plane can lead to moderate and severe geomagnetic storms.

by incentives. The protocol participants, called miners, generate (mine) a
series of blocks, each containing monetary transactions created by system
users. As incentive for participation, miners receive newly minted currency and
transaction fees paid by transaction creators. Blockchain bandwidth limits lead
users to pay increasing fees in order to prioritize their transactions.
However, most prior work focused on models where fees are negligible. In a
notable exception, Carlsten et al. postulated in CCS'16 that if incentives come
only from fees then a mining gap would form~--- miners would avoid mining when
the available fees are insufficient.
  In this work, we analyze cryptocurrency security in realistic settings,
taking into account all elements of expenses and rewards. To study when gaps
form, we analyze the system as a game we call \emph{the gap game}. We analyze
the game with a combination of symbolic and numeric analysis tools in a wide
range of scenarios.
  Our analysis confirms Carlsten et al.'s postulate; indeed, we show that gaps
form well before fees are the only incentive, and analyze the implications on
security. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that different miners choose different
gap sizes to optimize their utility, even when their operating costs are
identical. Alarmingly, we see that the system incentivizes large miner
coalitions, reducing system decentralization. We describe the required
conditions to avoid the incentive misalignment, providing guidelines for future
cryptocurrency design.

can be studied through single spin asymmetries in the photon-gluon fusion
subprocess in electron proton collisions at the EIC. Using a well tuned Monte

These interactions are quantified by measuring the change in free energy as a
function of the distance between the binding sites for two ligands. Here we
show that trends in the interaction energy of ligands binding to DNA can be
explained within an elastic birod model. The birod model accounts for the
deformation of each strand as well as the change in stacking energy due to
perturbations in position and orientation of the bases caused by the binding of
ligands. The strain fields produced by the ligands decay with distance from the
binding site. The interaction energy of two ligands decays exponentially with
the distance between them and oscillates with the periodicity of the double
helix in quantitative agreement with experimental measurements. The trend in
the computed interaction energy is similar to that in the perturbation of
groove width produced by the binding of a single ligand which is consistent
with molecular simulations. Our analysis provides a new framework to understand
allosteric interactions in DNA and can be extended to other rod-like

variation arises from the changes in magnetic field while the radius variation
plays a secondary role. We find that the solar irradiance increases with
decreasing seismic radius, however the anti-correlation between them is
moderately weak. The estimated maximum change in seismic radius during a solar
cycle is about 5 kilometers, and is consistent in both solar cycles 23 and 24.
Previous studies suggest a radius change at the surface of the order of 0.06

extending it so as to include dissipative effects as well. To this end, we
first elaborate on the most complete form of the conservation law for the
optical chirality, without any restrictions on the nature of the medium. As a
result we find a general expression for the optical chirality density both in
lossless and lossy dispersive media. Our definition is perfectly consistent
with that originally introduced for electromagnetic fields in free space, and
is applicable to any material system, including dielectrics, plasmonic
nanostructures, and left-handed metamaterials.

from two projection datasets generated from two distinct x-ray source energy
spectra. It can provide more accurate attenuation quantification than
conventional CT with a single x-ray energy spectrum. In the diagnostic energy
range, x-ray energy-dependent attenuation can be approximated as a linear
combination of photoelectric absorption and Compton scattering. Hence, two
physical components of x-ray attenuation can be determined from two spectral
informative projection datasets to achieve monochromatic imaging and material
decomposition. In this paper, a projection decomposition method is proposed for
the image reconstruction in dual-energy CT. This method combines both an
analytical algorithm and a single-variable optimization method to solve the
non-linear polychromatic x-ray integral model, allowing accurate quantification
of photoelectric absorption and Compton scattering components. Numerical tests
are performed to illustrate the merit of the proposed method by comparing with
classical projection decomposition methods.

of fundamental importance for the neutrino mass measurement as it significantly
influences the generation and transport of beta-decay electrons through the

of calculations of rarefied gas flow through the different components of the

simulations with a number of experimentally determined operational parameters
the gas model can be refreshed regularly according to the measured operating

compute the effective or net heating rate of baryons due to decaying magnetic
fields and its dependence on the magnetic field strength and spectral index. In
the drag-dominated regime ($z \gtrsim 1500$), prior to recombination, we find
no real heating is produced. Our simulations allow us to smoothly trace a new
transition regime ($600 \lesssim z \lesssim 1500$), where magnetic energy
decays, at first, into the kinetic energy of baryons. A turbulent velocity
field is built up until it saturates, as the net heating rate rises from a low
value at recombination to its peak towards the end of the transition regime.
This is followed by a turbulent decay regime ($z \lesssim 600$) where magnetic
energy dissipates via turbulent decay of both magnetic and velocity fields
while net heating remains appreciable and declines slowly. Both the peak of the
net heating rate and the onset of turbulent decay are delayed significantly
beyond recombination, by up to 0.5 Myr (until $z\simeq 600-700$), for
scale-invariant magnetic fields. We provide analytic approximations and present
numerical results for a range of field strengths and spectral indices,

and minimum visual phases employing the newly available GRAVITY beam combiner
at the VLTI. Our observations show a continuum radius that is anti-correlated
with the visual lightcurve. Uniform disc (UD) angular diameters at a
near-continuum wavelength of 2.25 mu are steadily increasing with values of 8.7
mas, 9.4 mas, 9.8 mas, and 9.9 mas at visual phases of 0.15, 0.36, 0,45, 0.53,
respectively. UD diameters at a bandpass around 2.05 mu, dominated by water
vapour, follow the near-continuum variability at larger UD diameters. UD
diameters at the CO 2-0 bandhead, instead, are correlated with the visual
lightcurve and anti-correlated with the near-continuum UD diameters. The
observed anti-correlation between continuum radius and visual lightcurve is
consistent with an earlier study of the oxygen-rich Mira S Lac, and with recent
1D CODEX dynamic model atmosphere predictions. The amplitude of the variation
is comparable to the earlier observations of S Lac, and smaller than predicted
by CODEX models. The wavelength-dependent visibility variations at our epochs
can be reproduced by a set of CODEX models at model phases between 0.3 and 0.6.
The anti-correlation of water vapour and CO contributions at our epochs
suggests that these molecules undergo different processes along the stellar
cycle. The newly available GRAVITY instrument is suited to conducting longer
time series observations, which are needed to provide strong constraints on the
model-predicted intra- and inter-cycle variability.

measurement systematic errors can be controlled. In Refregier & Amara (2014), a
calibration method based on forward modeling, called MCCL, was proposed. This
relies on fast image simulations (e.g., UFig; Berge et al. 2013) that capture
the key features of galaxy populations and measurement effects. The MCCL
approach has been used in Herbel et al. (2017) to determine the redshift
distribution of cosmological galaxy samples and, in the process, the authors
derived a model for the galaxy population mainly based on broad-band
photometry. Here, we test this model by forward modeling the 40 narrow-band
photometry given by the novel PAU Survey (PAUS). For this purpose, we apply the
same forced photometric pipeline on data and simulations using Source Extractor
(Bertin & Arnouts 1996). The image simulation scheme performance is assessed at
the image and at the catalogues level. We find good agreement for the
distribution of pixel values, the magnitudes, in the magnitude-size relation
and the interband correlations. A principal component analysis is then
performed, in order to derive a global comparison of the narrow-band photometry
between the data and the simulations. We use a `mixing' matrix to quantify the
agreement between the observed and simulated sets of Principal Components
(PCs). We find good agreement, especially for the first three most significant
PCs. We also compare the coefficients of the PCs decomposition. While there are
slight differences for some coefficients, we find that the distributions are in
good agreement. Together, our results show that the galaxy population model
derived from broad-band photometry is in good overall agreement with the PAUS
data. This offers good prospect for incorporating spectral information to the
galaxy model by adjusting it to the PAUS narrow-band data using forward
modeling.

from the fact that stars may form from gas enriched predominantly by asymptotic

at the onset of a starburst from gas enriched by low metallicity type-II
supernovae that power a strong outflow, quenching further star formation. When
star formation resumes following cosmological gas accretion, the CEMP-no stars
with higher [C/Mg] form, with enrichment by AGB ejecta evident in their higher
abundance of barium and lower abundance of magnesium. This suggests that bursty
star formation in the progenitors of the Galaxy leaves a permanent imprint in

host multiple popula- tions, that are characterised by distinct chemical
features such as helium abundance variations along with N-C and Na-O
anti-correlations, at fixed [Fe/H]. These very distinct chemical fea- tures are
similar to what is found in the centres of the massive early-type galaxies and
may influence measurements of the global properties of the galaxies.
Additionally, recent results have suggested that M/L variations found in the
centres of massive early-type galaxies might be due to a bottom-heavy stellar
initial mass function. We present an analysis of the effects of globular
cluster-like multiple populations on the integrated properties of early-type
galaxies. In particular, we focus on spectral features in the integrated
optical spectrum and the global mass-to-light ratio that have been used to
infer variations in the stellar initial mass function. To achieve this we
develop appropriate stellar population synthesis models and take into account,
for the first time, an initial-final mass relation which takes into
consideration a varying He abundance. We conclude that while the multiple
populations may be present in massive early-type galaxies, they are likely not
responsible for the observed variations in the mass- to-light ratio and IMF
sensitive line strengths. Finally, we estimate the fraction of stars with
multiple populations chemistry that come from disrupted globular clusters

measured and compared to a stellar mass and impact parameter matched sample of

high covering fraction ($94^{+6}_{-23}$% for rest-frame equivalent widths EW $>
124$ m\AA) whilst many of the metal ions are not detected in individual
sightlines. A sightline-by-sightline comparison between COS-AGN and the control

enhancements in the EW of both Ly$\alpha$ and SiIII at impact parameters $>

lack of detections of both high-ionization species near the AGN and strong
kinematic offsets between the absorption systemic galaxy redshifts indicates
that neither the AGN's ionization nor its outflows are the origin of these
differences. Instead, we suggest the observed differences could result from
either AGN hosts residing in haloes with intrinsically distinct gas properties,
or that their CGM has been affected by a previous event, such as a starburst,

population such that more massive galaxies at fixed $V_{\mathrm{max, DMO}}$ are
younger. The scatter in the stellar mass and mean stellar population age
results from variation in the baryonic mass, $M_{\mathrm{bary}} =

relating the outflow rate simultaneously to the SFR, $L_{\rm AGN}$, and galaxy
stellar mass; this relation is much tighter than the relations with the
individual quantities. The outflow kinetic power shows a larger scatter than in
previous, more biased studies, spanning from 0.1 to 5 per cent of $L_{\rm

indicating that these outflows can be both energy-driven, but with a broad
range of coupling efficiencies with the ISM, and radiation pressure-driven. For
about 10 per cent of the objects the outflow energetics significantly exceed
the maximum theoretical values; we interpret these as 'fossil outflows'
resulting from activity of a past strong AGN, which has now faded. We estimate
that, in the stellar mass range probed here ($>$ 10$^{10}~\rm M_{\odot}$), less
than 5 per cent of the outflowing gas escapes the galaxy. The molecular gas
depletion time associated with the outflow can be as short as a few million
years in powerful AGN, however, the total gas (H$_2$+HI) depletion times are

observed, or rescaled to match the mass-metallicity relation determined for

find that the HI surface densities saturate at sufficiently large total gas
surface density. The maximal HI columns vary approximately inversely with
metallicity, and show little variation with spatial resolution, galactocentric

HI gas is depressed by factors of 2. The observed behavior is naturally
reproduced by metallicity dependent shielding theories for the HI-to-H2

Trans-Neptunian Object detected detected by the Dark Energy Survey at a
heliocentric distance of 55 AU and absolute magnitude Hr= 4.3. The current
orbit, determined from a 1110-day observational arc, has semi-major axis
$a\approx$ 450 AU, eccentricity $e\approx$ 0.92 and inclination $i\approx$ 54
degrees. With these orbital elements, 2015 BP$_{519}$ is the most extreme TNO
discovered to date, as quantified by the reduced Kozai action, which is is a
conserved quantity at fixed semi-major axis $a$ for axisymmetric perturbations.
We discuss the orbital stability and evolution of this object in the context of
the known Solar System, and find that 2015 BP$_{519}$ displays rich dynamical
behavior, including rapid diffusion in semi-major axis and more constrained
variations in eccentricity and inclination. We also consider the long term
orbital stability and evolutionary behavior within the context of the Planet
Nine Hypothesis, and find that BP$_{519}$ adds to the circumstantial evidence
for the existence of this proposed new member of the Solar System, as it would
represent the first member of the population of high-i, $\varpi$-shepherded
TNOs.

committed or would commit crimes is essential to more effective allocation of
patrolling resources. The real-world data in this domain is often sparse, noisy
and incomplete, consisting of a small number of positive data (poaching signs),
a large number of negative data with label uncertainty, and an even larger
number of unlabeled data. Fortunately, domain experts such as rangers can
provide complementary information about poaching activity patterns. However,
this kind of human knowledge has rarely been used in previous approaches. In
this paper, we contribute new solutions to the predictive analysis of poaching
patterns by exploiting both very limited data and human knowledge. We propose
an approach to elicit quantitative information from domain experts through a
questionnaire built upon a clustering-based division of the conservation area.
In addition, we propose algorithms that exploit qualitative and quantitative
information provided by the domain experts to augment the dataset and improve
learning. In collaboration with World Wild Fund for Nature, we show that
incorporating human knowledge leads to better predictions in a conservation
area in Northeastern China where the charismatic species is Siberian Tiger. The
results show the importance of exploiting human knowledge when learning from
limited data.

low-mass galaxies. Reionization was inhomogeneous, however, affecting different
regions at different times. To establish the causal connection between
reionization and suppression, we must take this local variation into account.
We analyze the results of CoDa (`Cosmic Dawn') I, the first fully-coupled
radiation-hydrodynamical simulation of reionization and galaxy formation in the
Local Universe, in a volume large enough to model reionization globally but
with enough resolving power to follow all atomic-cooling galactic halos in that
volume. For every halo identified at a given time, we find the redshift at
which the surrounding IGM reionized, along with its instantaneous star
formation rate (`SFR') and baryonic gas-to-dark matter ratio
($M_\text{gas}/M_\text{DM}$). The average SFR per halo with $M < 10^9 \text{
M}_\odot$ was steady in regions not yet reionized, but declined sharply
following local reionization. For $M > 10^{10} \text{ M}_\odot$, this SFR
continued through local reionization, increasing with time, instead. For $10^9
< M < 10^{10} \text{ M}_\odot$, the SFR generally increased modestly through
reionization, followed by a modest decline. In general, halo SFRs were higher
for regions that reionized earlier. A similar pattern was found for
$M_\text{gas}/M_\text{DM}$, which declined sharply following local reionization
for $M < 10^9 \text{ M}_\odot$. Local reionization time correlates with local
matter overdensity, which determines the local rates of structure formation and
ionizing photon consumption. The earliest patches to develop structure and
reionize ultimately produced more stars than they needed to finish and maintain
their own reionization, exporting their `surplus' starlight to help reionize
regions that developed structure later.

However, this mode is often not successful in the extremely preterm infant in

provide enough structure against which the forces of inhalation can generate
sufficient pressure. To address the continued challenge of studying treatments
in this fragile population, we developed a nonlinear lumped-parameter model of
respiratory system mechanics of the extremely preterm infant that incorporates
nonlinear lung and chest wall compliances and lung volume parameters tuned to
this population. In particular we developed a novel empirical representation of
progressive volume loss based on compensatory alveolar pressure increase
resulting from collapsed alveoli. The model demonstrates increased rate of
volume loss related to high chest wall compliance, and simulates laryngeal
braking for elevation of end-expiratory lung volume and constant positive
airway pressure (CPAP). The model predicts that low chest wall compliance
(chest stiffening) in addition to laryngeal braking and CPAP enhance breathing
and delay lung volume loss. These results motivate future data collection
strategies and investigation into treatments for chest wall stiffening.

galaxies (SMGs), selected from the SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey (S2CLS)

emitters, with an expected false detection rate of ten percent. All of these
line emitters correspond to 870$\mu$m continuum-detected sources in AS2UDS. The
emission lines in two emitters appear to be high-J CO, but the remainder have
multi-wavelength properties consistent with [CII] from $z\simeq4.5$ galaxies.

space density of luminous ($L_{\rm IR} \simeq 10^{13}$Lsun) SMGs at
$z=4.40$-$4.66$, suggesting $\ge7$percent of SMGs with $S_{870\mu{\rm

to $r_{\rm e} = 1.0\pm0.1$kpc for the continuum (rest-frame $160\mu$m). By
fitting the far-infrared photometry for these galaxies from $100$-$870\mu$m, we
show that SMGs at $z\sim4.5$ have a median dust temperature of $T_{\rm

$z\simeq2$, which typically have temperatures around $35$K. These $z\simeq4.5$
SMGs display a steeper trend in the luminosity-temperature plane than $z\le2$

biases of high redshift starbursts in far-infrared/submillimeter surveys.

the earliest stages of their formation. Our continuum images reveal remarkably
complex and filamentary structures arising from compact cores. Molecular
emission shows no clear signs of rotation nor infall on scales from 150 to 2000

accretion disks on scales $r\lesssim$100--500 au (depending on the object). The
active outflows are connected to fossil flows that have different orientations
on larger spatial scales, implying that the orientations of these small disks
change over time. These results together support a variant of an accretion
model for high-mass star formation in which massive protostars do not form a
large, stable Keplerian disk during their early stages, but instead they
accrete material from multiple massive flows with different angular momentum
vectors. This scenario therefore contrasts with the simplified classic paradigm
of a stable disk+jet system, which is the standard model for low-mass star
formation, and provides an experimental confirmation of a multi-directional and
unsteady accretion model for massive star formation.

dramatically changes the metal abundances that we measure. Understanding the
metal content in the neutral ISM, and a direct comparison between different
environments, has been hampered to date because of the degeneracy to the
observed ISM abundances caused by the effects of metallicity, the presence of
dust, and nucleosynthesis. Aims. We study the metal and dust content in the
neutral ISM consistently in different environments, and assess the universality
of recently discovered sequences of relative abundances. We also intend to
assess the validity of [Zn/Fe] as a tracer of dust in the ISM. This has
recently been cast into doubt based on observations of stellar abundances, and
needs to be addressed before we can safely use it to study the ISM. Methods. In
this letter we present a simple comparison of relative abundances observed in
the neutral ISM in the Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds, and damped Lyman-{\alpha}
Absorbers (DLAs). The main novelty in this comparison is the inclusion of the
Magellanic Clouds. Results. The same sequences of relative abundances are valid
for the Galaxy, Magellanic Clouds, and DLAs. These sequences are driven by the
presence of dust in the ISM and seem 'universal'. Conclusions. The metal and
dust properties in the neutral ISM appear to follow a similar behaviour in
different environments. This suggests that a dominant fraction of the dust
budget is built up from grain growth in the ISM depending of the physical
conditions and regardless of the star formation history of the system. In
addition, the DLA gas behaves like the neutral ISM, at least from a chemical
point of view. Finally, despite the deviations in [Zn/Fe] observed in stellar
abundances, [Zn/Fe] is a robust dust tracer in the ISM of different
environments, from the Galaxy to DLAs.

a central feature of the accretion disk around a black hole. The resulting
low-frequency oscillations introduced from the growth and decay of the field
strength, along with the change in field orientation, play an integral role in
the accretion disk behavior. Despite the importance of this process and how
commonly it is invoked to explain variable features, it still remains poorly
understood. We present a study of the dynamo using a suite of four global,
high-resolution, MHD accretion disk simulations. We systematically vary the
scale height ratio and find the large-scale dynamo fails to organize above a
scale height ratio of $h/r \gtrsim0.2$. Using spacetime diagrams of the
azimuthal magnetic field, we show the large-scale dynamo is well-ordered in the
thinner accretion disk models, but fails to develop the characteristic
""butterfly"" pattern when the scale height ratio is increased, a feature which
is also reflected in the power spectra. Additionally, we calculate the dynamo
$\alpha$-parameter and generate synthetic light curves. Using an emission
proxy, we find the disks have markedly different characters as stochastic
photometric fluctuations have a larger amplitude when the dynamo is unordered.

large-scale datasets labeled with ground truth, which are often unavailable in

pulmonary nodules in lung computed tomography (CT) images, current practice is
to manually label nodule locations and sizes in many CT images to construct a

the other hand, electronic medical records (EMR) contain plenty of partial

evolution is related to the growth in complexity of initially simple Heisenberg
operators. Operator growth is a manifestation of information scrambling and can
be diagnosed by out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs). However, the behavior of
OTOCs of local operators in generic chaotic local Hamiltonians remains poorly
understood, with some semiclassical and large N models exhibiting exponential
growth of OTOCs and a sharp chaos wavefront and other random circuit models
showing a diffusively broadened wavefront. In this paper we propose a unified
physical picture for scrambling in chaotic local Hamiltonians. We construct a
random time-dependent Hamiltonian model featuring a large N limit where the
OTOC obeys a Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (FKPP) type equation and
exhibits exponential growth and a sharp wavefront. We show that quantum
fluctuations manifest as noise (distinct from the randomness of the couplings
in the underlying Hamiltonian) in the FKPP equation and that the noise-averaged
OTOC exhibits a cross-over to a diffusively broadened wavefront. At small N we
demonstrate that operator growth dynamics, averaged over the random couplings,
can be efficiently simulated for all time using matrix product state
techniques. To show that time-dependent randomness is not essential to our
conclusions, we push our previous matrix product operator methods to very large
size and show that data for a time-independent Hamiltonian model are also
consistent with a diffusively-broadened wavefront.

inner disk, although the spectral energy distribution indicates that small dust
still remains close to the star. Another target is surrounded by a transitional
disk, with an inner cavity in which little sub-micron dust remains. Still, the

aggregation process. Our framework learns to predict jointly the image class
label and an attention map in an end-to-end fashion and without any other
supervision than the target label. As evidenced by our experiments, this
consistently outperforms attention-less structured representation learning and
yields state-of-the-art results on standard scene recognition and fine-grained
categorization benchmarks.

men and a set of women with no blocking pairs, which are pairs formed by a man
and a woman who would both prefer switching from their current status to be
paired up together. When both men and women have strict preferences over the
opposite group, all stable matchings have the same cardinality, and the famous
Gale-Shapley algorithm can be used to find one. Differently, if we allow ties
in the preference lists, finding a stable matching of maximum cardinality is an
NP-hard problem, already when the ties are one-sided, that is, they appear only
in the preferences of one group. For this reason, many researchers have focused
on developing approximation algorithm for this problem.
  In this paper, we give a refined analysis of an approximation algorithm given
by Huang and Telikepalli (IPCO14) for the stable marriage problem with
one-sided ties, which shows an improved 13/9 -approximation factor for the
problem. Interestingly, our analysis is tight.

low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) evolves during a thermonuclear (type-I) X-ray
burst. The reason of this evolution, however, is not securely known. This
uncertainty can introduce significant systematics in the neutron star radius
measurement using burst spectra, particularly if an unknown but significant
fraction of the burst emission, which is reprocessed, contributes to the
changes in the persistent emission during the burst. Here, by analyzing
individual burst data of AstroSat/LAXPC from the neutron star LMXB 4U 1728--34
in the soft state, we show that the burst emission is not significantly
reprocessed by a corona covering the neutron star. Rather, our analysis
suggests that the burst emission enhances the accretion disk emission, possibly
by increasing the accretion rate via disk. This enhanced disk emission, which
is Comptonized by a corona covering the disk, can explain an increased
persistent emission observed during the burst. This finding provides an
understanding of persistent emission components, and their interaction with the
thermonuclear burst emission. Furthermore, since burst photons are not
significantly reprocessed, non-burst and burst emissions can be reliably
separated, which is required to reduce systematic uncertainties in the stellar
radius measurement.

featuring locally explosive episodes akin to speculative bubbles in financial

average (MA), conditional moments up to integer order four are shown to exist
provided $(X_t)$ is anticipative enough, despite the process featuring infinite
marginal variance. Formulae of these moments at any forecast horizon under any
admissible parameterisation are provided. Under the assumption of errors with
regularly varying tails, closed-form formulae of the predictive distribution
during explosive bubble episodes are obtained and expressions of the ex ante
crash odds at any horizon are available. It is found that the noncausal
autoregression of order 1 (AR(1)) with AR coefficient $\rho$ and tail exponent
$\alpha$ generates bubbles whose survival distributions are geometric with
parameter $\rho^{\alpha}$. This property extends to bubbles with
arbitrarily-shaped collapse after the peak, provided the inflation phase is
noncausal AR(1)-like. It appears that mixed causal-noncausal processes generate
explosive episodes with dynamics \`a la Blanchard and Watson (1982) which could
reconcile rational bubbles with tail exponents greater than 1. Applications of
the conditional moments to bubble modelling by noncausal processes are
discussed and the use of the closed-form crash odds is illustrated on the

because they are suited to program analysis and optimizations. However,
formalizing the behavior and metatheory of CFG programs is non-trivial: CFG
programs don't compose well, their semantics depends on auxiliary state, and,
as a consequence, they do not enjoy a simple equational theory that can be used
for reasoning about the correctness of program transformations.
Lambda-calculus-based intermediate representations, in contrast, have
well-understood operational semantics and metatheory, including rich equational
theories, all of which makes them amenable to formal verification.
  This paper establishes a tight equivalence between (a variant of) Levy's
call-by-push-value (CBPV) calculus and a control flow graph machine whose
instructions are in static single assignment (SSA) form. The correspondence is
made precise via a series of abstract machines that align the transitions of
the structural operational semantics of the CBPV language with the computation
steps of the SSA form.
  The target machine, which is derived from the CBPV language, accurately
captures the execution model of control flow graphs, including direct jumps,
mutually recursive code blocks, and multi-argument function calls, and the
closure-free subset is similar to the SSA intermediate representations found in
modern compilers such as LLVM and GCC. The definitions of all the
language/abstract machine semantics and the theorems relating them are fully
verified in Coq.

factor of $k$. It is a folklore that for every $n$-vertex graph $G$, one can
construct a $(2k-1)$ spanner with $O(n^{1+1/k})$ edges. In a distributed

show that it can significantly reduce the number of gradient computations
especially when the condition number $L/\mu$ (i.e., the ratio between the
Lipschitz constant and negative curvature) is large. More specifically, RapGrad
can save up to ${\cal O}(\sqrt{m})$ gradient computations than existing
deterministic nonconvex accelerated gradient methods. Moreover, the number of
gradient computations required by RapGrad can be ${\cal O}(m^\frac{1}{6}
L^\frac{1}{2} / \mu^\frac{1}{2})$ (at least ${\cal O}(m^\frac{2}{3})$) times
smaller than the best-known randomized nonconvex gradient methods when $L/\mu
\ge m$. Inspired by RapGrad, we also develop a new randomized accelerated
proximal dual (RapDual) method for solving a class of multi-block nonconvex
optimization problems coupled with linear constraints. We demonstrate that
RapDual can also save up to a factor of ${\cal O}(\sqrt{m})$ projection
subproblems than its deterministic counterpart, where $m$ denotes the number of

development of dependent type theory through the work of Per Martin--L\""of and
recent developments in homotopy type theory, i.e., the univalent foundations

have semantic models in (infinity,1)-categories, which are related to
simplicial localizations of Quillen model categories. The interaction of type

their photospheres. Given that the timescale for gravitational sedimentation is
astronomically short, this is taken as evidence for ongoing accretion, likely
of tidally disrupted planetesimals. The rate of such accretion, $\dot M_{\rm
acc}$, is important to constrain, and most modeling of this process relies on
assuming an equilibrium between diffusive sedimentation and metal accretion
supplied to the WD's surface convective envelope. Building on earlier work of
Deal and collaborators, we show that high $\dot M_{\rm acc}$ models with only
diffusive sedimentation are unstable to thermohaline mixing and that models
which account for the enhanced mixing from the active thermohaline instability
require larger accretion rates, sometimes reaching $\dot M_{\rm acc} \approx
10^{13} \, \rm g \, s^{-1}$ to explain observed Calcium abundances. We present
results from a grid of MESA models that include both diffusion and thermohaline
mixing. These results demonstrate that both mechanisms are essential for
understanding metal pollution across the range of polluted WDs with hydrogen
atmospheres. Another consequence of active thermohaline mixing is that the
observed metal abundance ratios are identical to accreted material.

regulation. Because of the abundance of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) in the cell,
different species will promiscuously associate with each other, suggesting
collective dynamics similar to artificial neural networks. Here we present a
simple mechanism allowing ncRNA to perform computations equivalent to neural
network algorithms such as Boltzmann machines and the Hopfield model. The
quantities analogous to the neural couplings are the equilibrium constants
between different RNA species. The relatively rapid equilibration of RNA
binding and unbinding is regulated by a slower process that degrades and
creates new RNA. The model requires that the creation rate for each species be
an increasing function of the ratio of total to unbound RNA. Similar mechanisms
have already been found to exist experimentally for ncRNA regulation. With the
overall concentration of RNA regulated, equilibrium constants can be chosen to
store many different patterns, or many different input-output relations. The
network is also quite insensitive to random mutations in equilibrium constants.
Therefore one expects that this kind of mechanism will have a much higher
mutation rate than ones typically regarded as being under evolutionary
constraint.

In
this paper, we propose a novel variant of the interval scheduling problem,
whose definition is as follows: given jobs are specified by their {\em release
times}, {\em deadlines} and {\em profits}. An algorithm must start a job at its
release time on one of $m$ identical machines, and continue processing until
its deadline on the machine to complete the job. All the jobs must be completed
and the algorithm can obtain the profit of a completed job as a user's
satisfaction. It is possible to process more than one job at a time on one
machine. The profit of a job is distributed uniformly between its release time
and deadline, that is its interval, and the profit gained from a subinterval of
a job decreases in reverse proportion to the number of jobs whose intervals
intersect with the subinterval on the same machine. The objective of our
variant is to maximize the total profit of completed jobs. This formulation is
naturally motivated by best-effort requests and responses to them, which appear
in many situations. In best-effort requests and responses, the total amount of
available resources for users is always invariant and the resources are equally
shared with every user. We study online algorithms for this problem.
Specifically, we show that for the case where the profits of jobs are
arbitrary, there does not exist an algorithm whose competitive ratio is
bounded. Then, we consider the case in which the profit of each job is equal to
its length, that is, the time interval between its release time and deadline.
For this case, we prove that for $m = 2$ and $m \geq 3$, the competitive ratios
of a greedy algorithm are at most $4/3$ and at most $3$, respectively. Also,
for each $m \geq 2$, we show a lower bound on the competitive ratio of any
deterministic algorithm.

water. While increased evapotranspiration (ET) in response to increased
atmospheric demand seems intuitive, plants are capable of reducing ET in
response to increased VPD by closing their stomata. We examine which effect
dominates the response to increasing VPD: atmospheric demand and increases in
ET, or plant response (stomata closure) and decreases in ET. We use
Penman-Monteith, combined with semi-empirical optimal stomatal regulation
theory and underlying water use efficiency, to develop a theoretical framework
for assessing ET response to VPD. The theory suggests that depending on the
environment and plant characteristics, ET response to increasing VPD can vary
from strongly decreasing to increasing, highlighting the diversity of plant
water regulation strategies.
  The ET response varies due to: 1) climate, with tropical and temperate
climates more likely to exhibit a positive ET response to increasing VPD than
boreal and arctic climates; 2) photosynthesis strategy, with C3 plants more
likely to exhibit a positive ET response than C4 plants; and 3) plant type,
with crops more likely to exhibit a positive ET response, and shrubs and
gymniosperm trees more likely to exhibit a negative ET response. These results,
derived from previous literature connecting plant parameters to plant and
climate characteristics, highlight the utility of our simplified framework for
understanding complex land atmosphere systems in terms of idealized scenarios
in which ET responds to VPD only. This response is otherwise challenging to
assess in an environment where many processes co-evolve together.

be? While most previous research was focused on analyzing mental state of users
from social media and smartphones, there is little effort towards protecting
user privacy in these analyses. A challenge in analyzing user behaviors is that
not only is the data multi-dimensional with a myriad of user activities but
these activities occur at varying temporal rates. The overarching question of
our work is: Given a set of sensitive user features, what is the minimum amount
of information required to group users with similar behavior? Furthermore, does
this user behavior correlate with their mental state? Towards answering those
questions, our contributions are two fold: we introduce the concept of privacy
surfaces that combine sensitive user data at different levels of intrusiveness.
As our second contribution, we introduce MIMiS, an unsupervised privacy-aware
framework that clusters users in a given privacy surface configuration to
homogeneous groups with respect to their temporal signature. In addition, we
explore the trade-off between intrusiveness and prediction accuracy. MIMiS
employs multi-set decomposition in order to deal with incompatible temporal
granularities in user activities. We extensively evaluate MIMiS on real data.
Across a variety of privacy surfaces, MIMiS identified groups that are highly
homogeneous with respect to self-reported mental health scores. Finally, we
conduct an in-depth exploration of the discovered clusters, identifying groups
whose behavior is consistent with academic deadlines.

certain properties of the density, and (iii) how to efficiently choose among a

for solving a variety of problems. They however can not be used in their native

SCNNs distinct from CNNs is that they exhibit the rotational equivariance
property that allows for sharing learned weights within a layer. In this paper,
we theoretically generalize the CNNs to Riemannian homogeneous manifolds, that
include but are not limited to the aforementioned example manifolds. Our key
contributions in this work are: (i) A theorem stating that linear group
equivariance systems are fully characterized by correlation of functions on the
domain manifold and vice-versa. This is fundamental to the characterization of
all linear group equivariant systems and parallels the widely used result in
linear system theory for vector spaces. (ii) As a corrolary, we prove the
equivariance of the correlation operation to group actions admitted by the
input domains which are Riemannian homogeneous manifolds. (iii) We present the
first end-to-end deep network architecture for classification of diffusion
magnetic resonance image (dMRI) scans acquired from a cohort of 44 Parkinson

SPHEREx
would carry out the first all-sky spectral survey in the near infrared. At the
end of its two-year mission, SPHEREx would obtain 0.75-to-5$\mu$m spectra of
every 6.2 arcsec pixel on the sky, with spectral resolution R>35 and a
5-$\sigma$ sensitivity AB$>$19 per spectral/spatial resolution element. More
details concerning SPHEREx are available at http://spherex.caltech.edu. The
SPHEREx team has proposed three specific science investigations to be carried
out with this unique data set: cosmic inflation, interstellar and circumstellar
ices, and the extra-galactic background light. Though these three themes are
undoubtedly compelling, they are far from exhausting the scientific output of
SPHEREx. Indeed, SPHEREx would create a unique all-sky spectral database
including spectra of very large numbers of astronomical and solar system
targets, including both extended and diffuse sources. These spectra would
enable a wide variety of investigations, and the SPHEREx team is dedicated to
making the data available to the community to enable these investigations,
which we refer to as Legacy Science. To that end, we have sponsored two
workshops for the general scientific community to identify the most interesting
Legacy Science themes and to ensure that the SPHEREx data products are
responsive to their needs. In February of 2016, some 50 scientists from all
fields met in Pasadena to develop these themes and to understand their
implications for the SPHEREx mission. The 2016 workshop highlighted many
synergies between SPHEREx and other contemporaneous astronomical missions,
facilities, and databases. Consequently, in January 2018 we convened a second
workshop at the Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge to focus specifically on
these synergies. This white paper reports on the results of the 2018 SPHEREx
workshop.

great promise, due to a powerful combination of massive adoption of social
media around the world, and increasingly potent hardware and software that
enables us to work with these new big data streams. At the same time, many
challenging problems have been identified. First, there is often a mismatch
between how rapidly online data can change, and how rapidly algorithms are
updated, which means that there is limited reusability for algorithms trained
on past data as their performance decreases over time. Second, much of the work
is focusing on specific issues during a specific past period in time, even
though public health institutions would need flexible tools to assess multiple
evolving situations in real time. Third, most tools providing such capabilities
are proprietary systems with little algorithmic or data transparency, and thus
little buy-in from the global public health and research community. Here, we
introduce Crowdbreaks, an open platform which allows tracking of health trends
by making use of continuous crowdsourced labelling of public social media
content. The system is built in a way which automatizes the typical workflow
from data collection, filtering, labelling and training of machine learning
classifiers and therefore can greatly accelerate the research process in the
public health domain. This work introduces the technical aspects of the

images for kernel estimation. In this paper, we address the problem of
deblurring face images by exploiting facial structures. We propose a deblurring

flow, requiring them to switch mental state and an additional immersion period
to get back into the flow. However, the wasted time due to time fragmentation
caused by task switching is largely invisible and unnoticed by developers and

their perceptions of differences between task switching and task interruption

  Interruptions More Disruptive than Others?",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multitasking has always been an inherent part of software development and is
known as the primary source of interruptions due to task switching in software
development teams. Developing software involves a mix of analytical and
creative work, and requires a significant load on brain functions, such as
working memory and decision making. Thus, task switching in the context of
software development imposes a cognitive load that causes software developers
to lose focus and concentration while working thereby taking a toll on
productivity. To investigate the disruptiveness of task switching and
interruptions in software development projects, and to understand the reasons
for and perceptions of the disruptiveness of task switching we used a
mixed-methods approach including a longitudinal data analysis on 4,910 recorded
tasks of 17 professional software developers, and a survey of 132 software
developers. We found that, compared to task-specific factors (e.g. priority,
level, and temporal stage), contextual factors such as interruption type (e.g.
self/external), time of day, and task type and context are a more potent
determinant of task switching disruptiveness in software development tasks.
Furthermore, while most survey respondents believe external interruptions are
more disruptive than self-interruptions, the results of our retrospective
analysis reveals otherwise. We found that self-interruptions (i.e. voluntary
task switchings) are more disruptive than external interruptions and have a
negative effect on the performance of the interrupted tasks. Finally, we use
the results of both studies to provide a set of comparative vulnerability and
interaction patterns which can be used as a mean to guide decision-making and
forecasting the consequences of task switching in software development teams.

In

is killing more than 100 people each day, was declared as a public health
emergency by the US government, in October 2017. Although a few health related
companies and commercial firms have examined this important issue from various
available data sources, to the best of our knowledge, the academic community
has not been engaged in research in this important topic. It can be safely
noted that the study of the epidemic, from the data analytics perspective, is
in its infancy. Given that a significant amount of Opioid related data is
available in public domain, it provides the academic community an opportunity
to analyze such data to provide recommendations to the public health
authorities to mitigate the impact of the epidemic. In that vein, we collected
some publicly available data to analyze the important contributing factors of
the epidemic. In particular, we examine the role of the individuals prescribing
Opioid drugs on the spread of the epidemic. In addition, we examine the impact
of income level, age and educational level of various neighborhoods in a large
US city, on Opioid related incidences, to find any correlation between them.

large-scale image inputs data. However, in many real-world applications, we can
only have access to vectorized inputs data. Moreover, on one hand, well-labeled
data is usually limited due to the high annotation cost. On the other hand, the
real data is commonly streaming data, which requires to be processed online. In
these scenarios, the fashionable deep metric learning is not suitable anymore.
To this end, we reconsider the traditional shallow online metric learning and
newly develop an online progressive deep metric learning (ODML) framework to
construct a metric-algorithm-based deep network. Specifically, we take an
online metric learning algorithm as a metric-algorithm-based layer (i.e.,
metric layer), followed by a nonlinear layer, and then stack these layers in a
fashion similar to deep learning. Different from the shallow online metric
learning, which can only learn one metric space (feature transformation), the
proposed ODML is able to learn multiple hierarchical metric spaces.
Furthermore, in a progressively and nonlinearly learning way, ODML has a
stronger learning ability than traditional shallow online metric learning in
the case of limited available training data. To make the learning process more
explainable and theoretically guaranteed, we also provide theoretical analysis.
The proposed ODML enjoys several nice properties and can indeed learn a metric
progressively and performs better on the benchmark datasets. Extensive
experiments with different settings have been conducted to verify these
properties of the proposed ODML.

with information theoretic security and key rates suitable for real-world
applications. Its rate-distance figure, however, is limited by the natural loss
of the communication channel and can never surpass a theoretical limit known as
point-to-point secret key capacity. Recently, a new type of quantum key
distribution with an intermediate relay was proposed to overcome this limit (M.
Lucamarini, Z. L. Yuan, J. F. Dynes and A. J. Shields, Nature, 2018). However,
a standard application of the decoy state method limited the security analysis
of this scheme to hold under restrictive assumptions for the eavesdropper.
Hence, overcoming the point-to-point secret key capacity with an
information-theoretic secure scheme is still an open question. Here, we propose
a novel way to use decoy states to answer this question. The key idea is to
switch between a Test mode and a Code mode, the former enabling the decoy state
parameter estimation and the latter generating a key through a phase encoding
protocol. This way, we confirm the scaling properties of the original scheme
and overcome the secret key capacity at long distances. Our work plays a key
role to unlock the potential of practical secure quantum communications.

two major, inter-related, aspects that arise when modelling physical measures.
Firstly, there is often a heterogeneity of representation; for example: speed
can be represented in many different units (mph, kph, mps, etc. . . ).
Secondly, there is incoherence in composition; for example: adding a speed to a
temperature would provide a meaningless result in the physical world, even

These aspects are problematic when implicit semantics - concerned with
measurements - in CPSs are not explicit (enough) in the requirements, design

illustrate this by moving from Event-B models to Java implementations, via

leading edge gap as observed in ARPES measurement in the underdoped cuprates,
even though clear evidence for the violation of the particle-hole symmetry is
found in the electron spectrum. To support this assertion, we studied the
electron spectrum under the scattering of diffusive antiferromagnetic(AF) spin
fluctuation, which is thought to be a major candidate for a competing order in
the competing order scenario of the pseudogap phenomena. We find that the Fermi
level crossing along the M=$(\pi,0)$ to X=$(\pi,\pi)$ line can only be avoided
when the M point is pushed above the Fermi level in this scenario. We argue
that the same conclusion holds in all competing order scenarios that preserve
the U(1) charge conservation. The inconsistency between this prediction and the
ARPES observation implies that a competing order in the particle-hole channel
alone is not sufficient to explain the pseudogap as observed in ARPES
measurement. We also find that the electron system always forms a single large
Fermi surface under the scattering of short-ranged dynamical spin fluctuation,
rather than forming small Fermi pockets as predicted by the AF band folding
picture. The AF shadow band is smeared out in energy as a result of the
dispersion in the scattered quasiparticle state and the diffusion in spin
fluctuation energy. Nevertheless, we find that the AF band folding effect is
important for the understanding of the quasiparticle dynamics in the pseudogap
phase, especially, of the origin of the high energy hump structure in the
anti-nodal region and the signature of particle-hole asymmetry in the electron
spectrum.

generalization performance of a classifier is closely related to the adequacy

Therefore, transferring information closely related to the decision boundary

utilize an adversarial attack to discover samples supporting a decision

a single change of basis that renders an entire set of mutually-commuting

solving the eigenvalue/eigenvector problem for a special element in that set. A
brief outline is given of how this line of thinking can be generalized to

applications lies in the limited communication distance and key generation

channel. For all the current implementations, the key rate is bounded by the
channel transmission probability, $\eta$. Rather surprisingly, by matching the
phases of two coherent states and encoding the key information into the common
phase, this linear key-rate constraint can be overcome---the secure key rate
scales with the square root of the transmission probability, $O(\sqrt{\eta})$,
as proposed in twin-field quantum key distribution [Nature (London) 557, 400

is different from the conventional qubit-based security proofs. Furthermore,
the proposed scheme is measurement device independent, i.e., it is immune to
all possible detection attacks. The simulation result shows that the key rate
can even exceed the transmission probability $\eta$ between two communication
parties. In addition, we apply phase postcompensation to devise a practical
version of the scheme without phase locking, which makes the proposed scheme
feasible with the current technology. This means that quantum key distribution
can enjoy both sides of the world---practicality and security.

Deep Field South (CDFS) and the ESO Large Area ISO Survey South 1 (ELAIS-S1)

cross-identifications of CDFS from the initial ATLAS data release and
crowdsourced cross-identifications of CDFS from Radio Galaxy Zoo. We found that
a simple strategy of cross-identifying a radio component with the nearest
galaxy performs comparably to our more complex methods, though our estimated
best-case performance is near 100 per cent. ATLAS contains 87 complex radio
sources that have been cross-identified by experts, so there are not enough
complex examples to learn how to cross-identify them accurately. Much larger
datasets are therefore required for training methods like ours. We also show
that training our method on Radio Galaxy Zoo cross-identifications gives

electric-dipole transition rates are strongly dependent on the external

strong SOC significantly impact the electron state coherence, we also calculate

at near-equipartition with turbulent kinetic energy density. In a rotating
fluid containing small-scale magnetic fluctuations, anisotropic terms in the
mean electromotive force are induced via the Coriolis effect and these terms
lead to a reduction of the growth rate in a predominantly $\alpha\Omega$-type
galactic dynamo (Chamandy & Singh 2017). By including the generation of
small-scale magnetic fluctuations by turbulent tangling of the large-scale
magnetic field, one obtains a negative feedback effect that quenches the dynamo
and leads to the saturation of the large-scale field. This saturation mechanism
is found to be competitive with the dynamical $\alpha$-quenching mechanism for
realistic galactic parameter values. Furthermore, in the context of the
dynamical $\alpha$-quenching model, a separate non-linear term is obtained

flowchart is that, in order to optimize the target network (student), another
network (teacher) with the same architecture is first trained, and used to
provide part of supervision signals in the next stage. While this strategy
leads to a higher accuracy, many aspects (e.g., why teacher-student
optimization helps) still need further explorations.
  This paper studies this problem from a perspective of controlling the
strictness in training the teacher network. Existing approaches mostly used a
hard distribution (e.g., one-hot vectors) in training, leading to a strict
teacher which itself has a high accuracy, but we argue that the teacher needs
to be more tolerant, although this often implies a lower accuracy. The
implementation is very easy, with merely an extra loss term added to the
teacher network, facilitating a few secondary classes to emerge and complement
to the primary class. Consequently, the teacher provides a milder supervision
signal (a less peaked distribution), and makes it possible for the student to
learn from inter-class similarity and potentially lower the risk of
over-fitting. Experiments are performed on standard image classification tasks
(CIFAR100 and ILSVRC2012). Although the teacher network behaves less powerful,
the students show a persistent ability growth and eventually achieve higher
classification accuracies than other competitors. Model ensemble and transfer
feature extraction also verify the effectiveness of our approach.

bursts from several accretion rates $\dot{M}$ are required to remove
degeneracies in astrophysical conditions that otherwise reproduce bursts for a
single $\dot{M}$ and that such consistent multi-epoch modeling could possibly
limit the $^{15}\rm{O}(\alpha,\gamma)^{19}\rm{Ne}$ reaction rate. Comparisons
to the year 1998, 2000, and 2007 bursting epochs of the neutron star GS 1826-24

shallow heating in this source must be below 0.5 MeV/u, providing a new method
to constrain the shallow heating mechanism in the outer layers of accreting

numerical analysis and recall the concept of rDMV solutions based on the total
energy balance and renormalization of entropy inequality for the physical
entropy presented in [8]. We then give two different ways how to generate rDMV
solutions. First via vanishing viscosity limit using Navier-Stokes equations
coupled with entropy transport and second via the vanishing dissipation limit
of the two-velocity model proposed by H. Brenner. Finally, we recall the
weak--strong uniqueness principle for rDMV solutions proved in [8] and [9].

perceived from the C-V transition; later, Stevens proposed that acoustic
landmarks are the primary cues for speech perception, and that steady-state
regions are secondary or supplemental. Acoustic landmarks are perceptually
salient, even in a language one doesn't speak, and it has been demonstrated
that non-speakers of the language can identify features such as the primary
articulator of the landmark. These factors suggest a strategy for developing
language-independent automatic speech recognition: landmarks can potentially be
learned once from a suitably labeled corpus and rapidly applied to many other
languages. This paper proposes enhancing the cross-lingual portability of a
neural network by using landmarks as the secondary task in multi-task learning
(MTL). The network is trained in a well-resourced source language with both
phone and landmark labels (English), then adapted to an under-resourced target
language with only word labels (Iban). Landmark-tasked MTL reduces
source-language phone error rate by 2.9% relative, and reduces target-language
word error rate by 1.9%-5.9% depending on the amount of target-language
training data. These results suggest that landmark-tasked MTL causes the DNN to
learn hidden-node features that are useful for cross-lingual adaptation.

each with a fast local ephemeral memory of limited size, and sharing a large
persistent memory. The model allows for each processor to fault with bounded
probability, and possibly restart. On faulting all processor state and local
ephemeral memory are lost, but the persistent memory remains. This model is
motivated by upcoming non-volatile memories that are as fast as existing random
access memory, are accessible at the granularity of cache lines, and have the
capability of surviving power outages. It is further motivated by the
observation that in large parallel systems, failure of processors and their
caches is not unusual.
  Within the model we develop a framework for developing locality efficient
parallel algorithms that are resilient to failures. There are several
challenges, including the need to recover from failures, the desire to do this
in an asynchronous setting (i.e., not blocking other processors when one
fails), and the need for synchronization primitives that are robust to
failures. We describe approaches to solve these challenges based on breaking
computations into what we call capsules, which have certain properties, and
developing a work-stealing scheduler that functions properly within the context
of failures. The scheduler guarantees a time bound of $O(W/P_A + D(P/P_A)
\lceil\log_{1/f} W\rceil)$ in expectation, where $W$ and $D$ are the work and
depth of the computation (in the absence of failures), $P_A$ is the average
number of processors available during the computation, and $f \le 1/2$ is the
probability that a capsule fails. Within the model and using the proposed
methods, we develop efficient algorithms for parallel sorting and other
primitives.

so-called fluctuation theorems. The thermodynamic second law is a simple
corollary of fluctuation theorems, from which one can predict quantitatively
how often NEQ processes violate the law of entropy increase. Violations
disappear in the thermodynamic limit, but can be observed reasonably well in
small systems. In this article, we will briefly introduce the stochastic

activity. We also aim to quantify and interpret the deflection and deceleration
of the flow expected from ionization of neutral cometary particles within the
undisturbed solar wind. Methods. We have analysed in situ ion and magnetic
field data and combined this with hybrid modeling of the interaction between
the solar wind and the comet atmosphere. Results. The solar wind deflection is
increasing with decreasing heliocentric distances, and exhibits very little
deceleration. This is seen both in observations and in modeled solar wind
protons. According to our model, energy and momentum are transferred from the
solar wind to the coma in a single region, centered on the nucleus, with a size
in the order of 1000 km. This interaction affects, over larger scales, the
downstream modeled solar wind flow. The energy gained by the cometary ions is a
small fraction of the energy available in the solar wind. Conclusions. The
deflection of the solar wind is the strongest and clearest signature of the
mass-loading for a small, low-activity comet, whereas there is little
deceleration of the solar wind.

coexistence. Indeed the orthogonality of the OFDM waveform is broken by the use
of different subcarrier spacings and therefore multiplexed communications may
interfere with each others. A first and simple solution to limit the distortion

perform asymptotically fewer writes than standard algorithms for the same

read performance being close to that of random access memory but writes being
significantly more expensive in terms of energy and latency. We design
algorithms for planar Delaunay triangulation, $k$-d trees, and static and
dynamic augmented trees. Our algorithms are designed in the recently introduced
Asymmetric Nested-Parallel Model, which captures the parallel setting in which
there is a small symmetric memory where reads and writes are unit cost as well
as a large asymmetric memory where writes are $\omega$ times more expensive
than reads. In designing these algorithms, we introduce several techniques for
obtaining write-efficiency, including DAG tracing, prefix doubling,
reconstruction-based rebalancing and $\alpha$-labeling, which we believe will
be useful for designing other parallel write-efficient algorithms.

the two major sources causing clumping of dust particles and turbulence in the

the magneto-rotational instability does not grow. Extensive numerical
simulations have been carried out in order to elucidate the condition for the

and the other is the dust particle column density that is nondimensionalized
using the gas density in the midplane, Keplerian angular velocity, and
difference between the Keplerian and gaseous orbital velocities. The magnitude
of dust clumping is a measure of the behavior of the dust layer. Using
three-dimensional numerical simulations of dust particles and gas based on
Athena code v. 4.2, it is confirmed that the magnitude of dust clumping for two
disk models are similar if the corresponding sets of values of the two

nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD), the nanowire is usually modelled as an
inductor in series with a time-varying resistor induced by absorption of a
photon. Our recent experimental results show that, due to the effect of kinetic
inductance, for a SNSPD made of a nanowire of sufficient length, its geometry
length can be comparable to or even longer than the effective wavelength of
frequencies contained in the output pulse. In other words, a superconducting
nanowire can behave as a distributed transmission line so that the readout
pulse depends on the photon detection location and the transmission line
properties of the nanowire. Here, we develop a distributed model for a
superconducting nanowire and apply it to simulate the output performance of a
long nanowire designed into a coplanar waveguide. We compare this coplanar
waveguide geometry to a conventional meander nanowire geometry. The simulation
results agree well with our experimental observations. With this distributed
model, we discussed the importance of microwave design of a nanowire and how
impedance matching can affect the output pulse shape. We also discuss how the

states with and without spontaneous surface current. The phase transition takes
place due to the formation of surface Andreev bound states in unconventional
superconductors. Based on the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity, we
examine the influence of atomic-scale surface roughness on the surface phase
transition temperature $T_s$. To describe the surface effect, the boundary
condition for the quasiclassical Green's function is parameterized in terms of
specularity (the specular reflection probability in the normal state at the
Fermi level). This boundary condition allows systematic study of the surface
effect ranging from the specular limit to the diffuse limit. We show that
diffuse quasiparticle scattering at a rough surface causes substantial
reduction of $T_s$ in the d-wave pairing state of high-$T_c$ cuprate
superconductors. We also consider a p-wave pairing state in which Andreev bound
states similar to those in the d-wave state are generated. In contrast to the
d-wave case, $T_s$ in the p-wave state is insensitive to the specularity. This
is because the Andreev bound states in the p-wave superconductor are robust
against diffuse scattering, as implied from symmetry consideration for
odd-frequency Cooper pairs induced at the surface; the p-wave state has
odd-frequency pairs with s-wave symmetry, while the d-wave state does not.

partially occluded. Recently, the cascaded pose regression has attracted
increasing attentions, due to it's superior performance in facial landmark
localization and occlusion detection. However, such an approach is sensitive to
initialization, where an improper initialization can severly degrade the
performance. In this paper, we propose a Robust Initialization for Cascaded
Pose Regression (RICPR) by providing texture and pose correlated initial shapes
for the testing face. By examining the correlation of local binary patterns
histograms between the testing face and the training faces, the shapes of the
training faces that are most correlated with the testing face are selected as
the texture correlated initialization. To make the initialization more robust
to various poses, we estimate the rough pose of the testing face according to
five fiducial landmarks located by multitask cascaded convolutional networks.
Then the pose correlated initial shapes are constructed by the mean face's
shape and the rough testing face pose. Finally, the texture correlated and the
pose correlated initial shapes are joined together as the robust
initialization. We evaluate RICPR on the challenging dataset of COFW. The

the first experimental search for invisible decays of a light vector meson

in various scientific, engineering and financial research. They are typically
associated with stochastic instability caused by hidden unresolved processes.
Previous studies have shown that such instability can be modeled by a
stochastic damping in conditional Gaussian models. However, these results are
mostly obtained through numerical experiments, while a rigorous understanding
of the underlying mechanism is sorely lacking. This paper contributes to this
issue by establishing a theoretical framework, in which the tail density of
conditional Gaussian models can be rigorously determined. In rough words, we
show that if the stochastic damping takes negative values, the tail is
polynomial; if the stochastic damping is nonnegative but takes value zero, the
tail is between exponential and Gaussian. The proof is established by
constructing a novel, product-type Lyapunov function, where a Feynman-Kac
formula is applied. The same framework also leads to a non-asymptotic large
deviation bound for long-time averaging processes.

  Excitation Enabled by Spin Current","22 pages, 5 figures",,,,"physics.ins-det cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Magnetoresistance (MR) sensors provide cost-effective solutions for diverse
industrial and consumer applications, including emerging fields such as
internet-of-things (IoT), artificial intelligence and smart living.
Commercially available MR sensors such as anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR)
sensor, giant magnetoresistance (GMR) sensor and tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR)
sensors typically require an appropriate magnetic bias for both output
linearization and noise suppression, resulting in increased structural
complexity and manufacturing cost. Here, we demonstrate an all-in-one spin Hall
magnetoresistance (SMR) sensor with built-in AC excitation and rectification
detection, which effectively eliminates the requirements of any linearization
and domain stabilization mechanisms separate from the active sensing layer.
This was made possible by the coexistence of SMR and spin-orbit torque (SOT) in
ultrathin NiFe/Pt bilayers. Despite the simplest possible structure, the
fabricated Wheatstone bridge sensor exhibits essentially zero DC offset,
negligible hysteresis, and a detectivity of around 1nT/sqrt(Hz) at 1Hz. In
addition, it also shows an angle dependence to external field similar to those
of GMR and TMR, though it does have any reference layer (unlike GMR and TMR).
The superior performances of SMR sensors are evidently demonstrated in the
proof-of-concept experiments on rotation angle measurement, and vibration and
finger motion detection.

financial domain provides unprecedented opportunities to understand the stock
market more comprehensively and makes the price prediction more accurate than
before. However, they also bring challenges to classic statistic approaches
since those models might be constrained to a certain type of data. Aiming at
aggregating differently sourced information and offering type-free capability
to existing models, a framework for predicting stock market of scenarios with
mixed data, including scalar data, compositional data (pie-like) and functional
data (curve-like), is established. The presented framework is
model-independent, as it serves like an interface to multiple types of data and
can be combined with various prediction models. And it is proved to be
effective through numerical simulations. Regarding to price prediction, we
incorporate the trading volume (scalar data), intraday return series
(functional data), and investors' emotions from social media (compositional
data) through the framework to competently forecast whether the market goes up
or down at opening in the next day. The strong explanatory power of the
framework is further demonstrated. Specifically, it is found that the intraday
returns impact the following opening prices differently between bearish market
and bullish market. And it is not at the beginning of the bearish market but
the subsequent period in which the investors' ""fear"" comes to be indicative.
The framework would help extend existing prediction models easily to scenarios
with multiple types of data and shed light on a more systemic understanding of
the stock market.

galaxies, NGC 253, NGC 1068, IC 342, M82, M83, and NGC 6946, obtained with the
James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as part of the MALATANG survey. All galaxies were
mapped in the central 2 arcmin $\times$ 2 arcmin region at 14 arcsec (FWHM)
resolution (corresponding to linear scales of ~ 0.2-1.0 kpc). The L_IR-L'_dense
relation, where the dense gas is traced by the HCN J=4-3 and the HCO^+ J=4-3
emission, measured in our sample of spatially-resolved galaxies is found to
follow the linear correlation established globally in galaxies within the
scatter. We find that the luminosity ratio, L_IR/L'_dense, shows systematic
variations with L_IR within individual spatially resolved galaxies, whereas the
galaxy-integrated ratios vary little. A rising trend is also found between
L_IR/L'_dense ratio and the warm-dust temperature gauged by the 70 \mu m/100
\mu m flux ratio. We find the luminosity ratios of IR/HCN(4-3) and
IR/HCO^+(4-3), which can be taken as a proxy for the efficiency of star
formation in the dense molecular gas (SFE_dense), appears to be nearly
independent of the dense-gas fraction (f_dense) for our sample of galaxies. The
SFE of the total molecular gas (SFE_mol) is found to increase substantially
with f_dense when combining our data with that on local (ultra)luminous
infrared galaxies and high-z quasars. The mean L'_HCN(4-3)/L'_HCO^+(4-3) line
ratio measured for the six targeted galaxies is 0.9+/-0.6. No significant
correlation is found for the L'_HCN(4-3)/L'_HCO^+(4-3) ratio with the SFR as
traced by L_IR, nor with the warm-dust temperature, for the different

of two separate encoders, one that models the behaviour of the image sequence

temporal dependencies between the image sequence and the sentence-story and by
using the previous sentence-story encoder we achieve a better story flow. Our
solution generates long human-like stories that not only describe the visual
context of the image sequence but also contains narrative and evaluative
language. The obtained results were confirmed by manual human evaluation.

condensate of ${}^{23} \textrm{Na}$ atoms, we study the energetical stability
of a singly quantum vortex injected into the center of a quasi-two-dimensional
gas with zero total spin against dissocation into a pair of half-quantum
vortices. We find that the critical dissociation point of this
confinement-deconfinement type phase transition can be expressed in terms of
the ratio of density-density ($c_0$) and spin-spin ($c_2$) coupling constants.
The transition of bound to unbound vortices, in particular, sensitively depends
on (1) the ratio of system size ($R$) to density healing length ($\xi_d$), and
(2) the trap potential. Specifically, the critical ratio $(c_2 /
c_0)_{\textrm{cr}}$ increases when $R / \xi_d$ decreases, and is relatively
larger in a harmonic trap than in a box trap. Dissociation is energetically
generally favored for $c_2 / c_0 < (c_2 / c_0)_{\textrm{cr}}$, which as a
corollary implies that vortex dissociation is observed as well for negative
$c_2 < 0$, e.g., in a rubidium spin-1 BEC, whereas in a sodium spin-1 BEC
($c_2>0$) it is energetically blocked above the critical ratio $(c_2 /
c_0)_{\textrm{cr}}$. Tuning the coupling ratio $c_2/c_0$ by using microwave
control techniques, the dependence of the deconfinement phase transition on
coupling parameters, density, and system size we predict, can be verified in
experiments with ultracold spinor gases.

processes for probing the flavour structure of the Standard Model, with
outstanding sensitivity to new (pseudo)-scalar contributions. While the
branching ratio of $B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ has already been measured at the LHC in
the ballpark of the Standard Model expectation, there is still significant room
for New-Physics effects. We discuss how these may be revealed in the future
super-high precision era of $B$-decay studies by utilising new theoretically
clean observables, including CP-violating asymmetries. Another promising decay
is $B^0_{s}\to e^+e^-$, which has received little attention in view of its
enormously helicity suppressed Standard Model branching ratio, with the most
recent experimental upper bound dating back to 2009. Using the current
constraints on New Physics from $B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ as a guideline, we show
that the $B^0_s\to e^+e^-$ branching ratio may be hugely enhanced through new
(pseudo)-scalar contributions up to the regime of $B^0_{s}\to\mu^+\mu^-$.

warping factors only depend on the horizontal direction of the cylinder. By
singular, we mean that these factors are only assumed to be positive almost

recent developments on the Weyl-Titchmarsh theory for singular Sturm-Liouville
operators, we prove that the local Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps at each end are
well defined and determine the metric uniquely if: 1. (Doubly warped product
case) the coefficients of the metric are L $\infty$ and bounded from below by a
positive constant. 2. (Warped product case) the coefficients of the metrics
belong to a critical L p space where p < $\infty$ depends on the dimension of
the compact fibers of the cylinder. Finally, we show (in the warped product
case and for zero frequency) that these uniqueness results are sharp by giving
simple counterexamples for a class of singular metrics whose coefficients do
not belong to the critical L p space. All these counterexamples lead to a
region of space that is invisible to boundary measurements.

dealt with by assuming that the ideal steady state input belongs to a certain

catalogues of the galaxies NGC 1566, M51a, and NGC 628 from the Legacy
Extragalactic UV Survey (LEGUS) program. In order to test for the possible
existence of an age sequence across the spiral arms, we quantified the
azimuthal offset between star clusters of different ages in our target
galaxies. We found that NGC 1566, a grand-design spiral galaxy with bisymmetric
arms and a strong bar, shows a significant age gradient across the spiral arms
that appears to be consistent with the prediction of the stationary density
wave theory. In contrast, M51a with its two well-defined spiral arms and a
weaker bar does not show an age gradient across the arms. In addition, a
comparison with non LEGUS star cluster catalogues for M51a yields similar
results. We believe that the spiral structure of M51a is not the result of a
stationary density wave with a fixed pattern speed. Instead, tidal interactions
could be the dominant mechanism for the formation of spiral arms. We also found
no offset in the azimuthal distribution of star clusters with different ages

incorporating dopants into the crystal lattice is a challenging task. An
attractive alternative is the surface transfer doping by adsorption of
molecules on 2D crystals, which can lead to ordered molecular arrays. However,
such systems, demonstrated in ultra-high vacuum conditions (UHV), are often
unstable in ambient conditions. Here we show that air-stable doping of
epitaxial graphene on SiC - achieved by spin-coating deposition of
2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-tetracyano-quino-dimethane (F4TCNQ) incorporated in poly
(methyl-methacrylate) - proceeds via the spontaneous accumulation of dopants at
the graphene-polymer interface and by the formation of a charge-transfer
complex that yields low-disorder, charge-neutral graphene with carrier
mobilities ~70,000 cm2/Vs at cryogenic temperatures. The assembly of dopants on
2D materials assisted by a polymer matrix, demonstrated by spin coating
wafer-scale substrates in ambient conditions, opens up a scalable technological
route towards expanding the functionality of 2D materials.

strongly on evolutionary models. To estimate the mass of a directly imaged
substellar object, its extracted photometry or spectrum is used and adjusted
with model spectra together with the estimated age of the system. These models
still need to be properly tested and constrained. HD 4747B is a brown dwarf
close to the H burning mass limit, orbiting a nearby, solar-type star and has
been observed with the radial velocity method over almost two decades now. Its
companion was also recently detected by direct imaging, allowing a complete
study of this particular object. We aim to fully characterize HD 4747B by
combining a well constrained dynamical mass and a study of its observed
spectral features in order to test evolutionary models for substellar objects
and characterize its atmosphere. We combine the radial velocity measurements of
HIRES and CORALIE taken over two decades and high contrast imaging of several
epochs from NACO, NIRC2 and SPHERE to obtain a dynamical mass. From the SPHERE
data we obtain a low resolution spectrum of the companion from Y to H band, as
well as two narrow band-width photometric measurements in the K band. A study
of the primary star allows in addition to constrain the age of the system as
well as its distance. Thanks to the new SPHERE epoch and NACO archival data
combined with previous imaging data and high precision radial velocity
measurements, we have been able to derive a well constrained orbit. We derive a
dynamical mass of mB=70.0$\pm$1.6 MJup which is higher than a previous study,
but in better agreement with the models. By comparing the object with known
brown dwarfs spectra, we derive a spectral type of L9 and an effective
temperature of 1350$\pm$50 K. With a retrieval analysis we constrain the oxygen
and carbon abundances and compare them with the ones from the HR 8799 planets.

experience a novel temperature evolution dubbed as self-heating. Exothermic
semi-annihilation converts the DM mass to the kinetic energy. This yields a
unique DM temperature evolution, $T_{\chi} \propto 1 / a$, in contrast to $
T_{\chi} \propto 1 / a^{2}$ for free-streaming non-relativistic particles.
Self-heating continues as long as self-scattering sufficiently redistributes
the energy of DM particles. In this paper, we study the evolution of
cosmological perturbations in self-heating DM. We find that sub-GeV
self-heating DM leaves a cutoff on the subgalactic scale of the matter power
spectrum when the self-scattering cross section is $\sigma_{\rm self} /
m_{\chi} \sim {\cal O} (1) \,{\rm cm}^{2} /{\rm g}$. Then we present a particle
physics realization of the self-heating DM scenario. The model is based on
recently proposed strongly interacting massive particles with pion-like
particles in a QCD-like sector. Pion-like particles semi-annihilate into an
axion-like particle, which is thermalized with dark radiation. The dark
radiation temperature is smaller than the standard model temperature, evading
the constraint from the effective number of neutrino degrees of freedom. It is
easily realized when the dark sector is populated from the standard model
sector through a small coupling.

continuously accelerated up to tens of MeV by a driving electric field [1].
Highly energetic runaway electron (RE) beams capable of damaging the tokamak
first wall can be observed after a plasma disruption [2]. Therefore, it is of
primary importance to fully understand their generation mechanisms in order to
design mitigation systems able to guarantee safe tokamak operations. In a
previous work, [3], a test particle tracker was introduced in the JOREK 3D
non-linear MHD code and used for studying the electron confinement during a
simulated JET-like disruption. It was found in [3] that relativistic electrons
are not completely deconfined by the stochastic magnetic field taking place
during the disruption thermal quench (TQ). This is due to the reformation of
closed magnetic surfaces at the beginning of the current quench (CQ). This
result was obtained neglecting the inductive electric field in order to avoid
the unrealistic particle acceleration which otherwise would have happened due
to the absence of collision effects. The present paper extends [3] analysing
test electron dynamics in the same simulated JET-like disruption using the
complete electric field. For doing so, a simplified collision model is
introduced in the particle tracker guiding center equations. We show that
electrons at thermal energies can become RE during or promptly after the TQ due
to a combination of three phenomena: a first REs acceleration during the TQ due
to the presence of a complex MHD-induced electric field, particle reconfinement
caused by the fast reformation of closed magnetic surfaces after the TQ and a
secondary acceleration induced by the CQ electric field.

the forecasting of demand for products which exhibit very few sales. The

multivariate point process which allows for features such as auto-correlation,
cross-correlation, and temporal clustering, known to be present in sparse sales

which includes a hurdle component to cope with sparsity and an exciting
component to cope with temporal clustering within and across products. We then
cast this model within a Bayesian hierarchical framework, to allow the
borrowing of information across different products, which is key in addressing
the data sparsity per product. We conduct a detailed analysis using real sales

bona fide Cepheids, with pulsation periods of 9.83+/-0.01 d and 5.850+/-0.005 d
respectively, while NGC 6603 star W2249 does not show significant photometric
variability. Using the period-luminosity relationship for Cepheid variables, we
determine a distance to Be 51 of 5.3(+1.0,-0.8) kpc and an age of 44(+9,-8)
Myr, placing it in a sparsely-attested region of the Perseus arm. For Be 55, we
find a distance of 2.2+/-0.3 kpc and age of 63(+12,-11) Myr, locating the
cluster in the Local arm. Taken together with our recent discovery of a
long-period Cepheid in the starburst cluster VdBH222, these represent an
important increase in the number of young, massive Cepheids known in Galactic
open clusters. We also consider new Gaia (data release 2) parallaxes and proper
motions for members of Be 51 and Be 55; the uncertainties on the parallaxes do
not allow us to refine our distance estimates to these clusters, but the
well-constrained proper motion measurements furnish further confirmation of
cluster membership. However, future final Gaia parallaxes for such objects
should provide valuable independent distance measurements, improving the
calibration of the period-luminosity relationship, with implications for the
distance ladder out to cosmological scales.

  The main issue of the present analysis consists of determining a cyclical
evolution for the Bianchi I model, oscillating between the Big-Bounce induced
by the cut-off physics and the turning point due to the small cosmological
constant. Furthermore, the mean value of the Universe anisotropy variables
remains finite during the whole evolution, including the phase across the

taught in many universities worldwide as part of their computer science
program. A core component of such course is the design and implementation of
the query optimizer in a RDBMS. The goal of the query optimizer is to
automatically identify the most efficient execution strategies for executing
the declarative SQL queries submitted by users. The query optimization process
produces a query execution plan (QEP) which represents an execution strategy
for the query. Due to the complexity of the underlying query optimizer,
comprehension of a QEP demands that a student is knowledgeable of
implementation-specific issues related to the RDBMS. In practice, this is an
unrealistic assumption to make as most students are learning database
technology for the first time. Hence, it is often difficult for them to
comprehend the query execution strategy undertaken by a DBMS by perusing the
QEP, hindering their learning process. In this demonstration, we present a
novel system called NEURON that facilitates natural language interaction with
QEPs to enhance its understanding. NEURON accepts a SQL query (which may
include joins, aggregation, nesting, among other things) as input, executes it,
and generates a simplified natural language-based description (both in text and
voice form) of the execution strategy deployed by the underlying RDBMS.
Furthermore, it facilitates understanding of various features related to the
QEP through a natural language-based question answering framework. We advocate
that such tool, world's first of its kind, can greatly enhance students'

the difficulties are examined and it is proposed that the tensor functionals
currently favored are in fact numerically unstable. By reverting to an older,
more heuristic model it is shown that all of the technical difficulties are
eliminated. Application to a Lennard-Jones fluid results in a demonstration of
power of ftDFT to describe crystallization in a highly inhomogeneous system.
First, we show that droplets attached to a slightly hydrophobic wall
crystallize spontaneously upon being quenched. The resulting crystallites are
clearly faceted structures and are predominantly HCP structures. In contrast,
droplets in a fully periodic calculational cell remain stable to lower
temperatures and eventually show the same spontaneous localization of the
density into 'atoms' but in an amorphous structure having many of the
structural charactersitics of a glass. A small change of the protocol leads, at
the same temperature, to the formation of crystals, this time with the FCC
structure typical of bulk Lennard-Jones solids. The FCC crystals have lower
free energy than the amorphous structures which in turn are more stable than
the liquid droplets. It is demonstrated that as the temperature is raised, the
free energy differences between the structures decreases until the solid
clusters become less stable than the liquid droplets and spontaneously melt.
The presence of energy barriers separating the various structures is therefore
clearly demonstrated.

Transforming this continuously arriving raw data into timely insights is
critical for many modern online services. For such settings, the traditional
form of data analytics over the entire dataset would be prohibitively limiting
and expensive for supporting real-time stream analytics. In this work, we make
a case for approximate computing for data analytics in IoT settings.
Approximate computing aims for efficient execution of workflows where an
approximate output is sufficient instead of the exact output. The idea behind
approximate computing is to compute over a representative sample instead of the
entire input dataset. Thus, approximate computing - based on the chosen sample
size - can make a systematic trade-off between the output accuracy and
computation efficiency. This motivated the design of APPROXIOT - a data
analytics system for approximate computing in IoT. To realize this idea, we
designed an online hierarchical stratified reservoir sampling algorithm that
uses edge computing resources to produce approximate output with rigorous error
bounds. To showcase the effectiveness of our algorithm, we implemented
APPROXIOT based on Apache Kafka and evaluated its effectiveness using a set of
microbenchmarks and real-world case studies. Our results show that APPROXIOT
achieves a speedup 1.3X-9.9X with varying sampling fraction of 80% to 10%

when participants processed fast-varying features of articulatory movements
required for visual-speech recognition, as compared to temporally more stable
features required for face identification with the same stimulus material. The
LGN response during the visual-speech task correlated positively with the
visual-speech recognition scores across participants. In addition, the
task-dependent modulation was present for speech movements and did not occur
for control conditions involving non-speech biological movements. In
face-to-face communication, visual speech recognition is used to enhance or

explained in frameworks focusing on cerebral cortex areas. Our findings suggest
that task-dependent modulation at subcortical sensory stages has an important

simply by the chain rule, the question arises how regular a weak solution needs
to be to guarantee this conservation property. Whereas the classical
DiPerna-Lions theory gives sufficient conditions in terms of the regularity of
the coefficients, with no regularity requirement on the transported scalar, we
give here sufficient conditions in terms of the combined regularities of the

learning applications. The key to successful multi-label learning algorithms
lies in the exploration of inter-label correlations, which usually incur great
computational cost. Another notable factor in multi-label learning is that the
label vectors are usually extremely sparse, especially when the candidate label
vocabulary is very large and only a few instances are assigned to each
category. Recently, a label space transformation (LST) framework has been
proposed targeting these challenges. However, current methods based on LST
usually suffer from information loss in the label space dimension reduction
process and fail to address the sparsity problem effectively. In this paper, we
propose a distribution-based label space transformation (DLST) model. By
defining the distribution based on the similarity of label vectors, a more
comprehensive label structure can be captured. Then, by minimizing
KL-divergence of two distributions, the information of the original label space
can be approximately preserved in the latent space. Consequently, multi-label
classifier trained using the dense latent codes yields better performance. The
leverage of distribution enables DLST to fill out additional information about
the label correlations. This endows DLST the capability to handle label set
sparsity and training data sparsity in multi-label learning problems. With the
optimal latent code, a kernel logistic regression function is learned for the
mapping from feature space to the latent space. Then ML-KNN is employed to
recover the original label vector from the transformed latent code. Extensive
experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DLST not only
achieves high classification performance but also is computationally more
efficient.

on very small parts of the considered spatial domain. However, in some cases,
e.g. magnetic reconnection, it is sufficient to solve the Vlasov equation in a
localized domain and solve the remaining domain by appropriate fluid models. In
this paper, we describe a hierarchical treatment of collisionless plasmas in
the following way. On the finest level of description, the Vlasov equation is
solved both for ions and electrons. The next courser description treats
electrons with a 10-moment fluid model incorporating a simplified treatment of
Landau damping. At the boundary between the electron kinetic and fluid region,
the central question is how the fluid moments influence the electron
distribution function. On the next coarser level of description the ions are
treated by an 10-moment fluid model as well. It may turn out that in some
spatial regions far away from the reconnection zone the temperature tensor in
the 10-moment description is nearly isotopic. In this case it is even possible
to switch to a 5-moment description. This change can be done separately for
ions and electrons. To test this multiphysics approach, we apply this full
physics-adaptive simulations to the Geospace Environmental Modeling (GEM)

to utilise an analytic one-dimensional approximation to the CSR force. We
present an extension of the 1D CSR theory in order to correctly account for the

applicability to this solution, in particular in bunches with a large

recently developed codes calculate the CSR effect in dispersive regions
directly from the Lienard-Wiechert potentials, albeit with approximations to
improve the computational time. A new module of the General Particle Tracer

against other codes. We experimentally demonstrate departure from the commonly

certain constraints. This often results in non-linear and non-convex
optimization problems with globally coupled variables, which pose great
challenge for interactive applications. Local-global solvers developed in
recent years can quickly compute an approximate solution to such problems,
making them an attractive choice for applications that prioritize efficiency
over accuracy. However, these solvers suffer from lower convergence rate, and
may take a long time to compute an accurate result. In this paper, we propose a
simple and effective technique to accelerate the convergence of such solvers.
By treating each local-global step as a fixed-point iteration, we apply
Anderson acceleration, a well-established technique for fixed-point solvers, to
speed up the convergence of a local-global solver. To address the stability
issue of classical Anderson acceleration, we propose a simple strategy to
guarantee the decrease of target energy and ensure its global convergence. In
addition, we analyze the connection between Anderson acceleration and
quasi-Newton methods, and show that the canonical choice of its mixing
parameter is suitable for accelerating local-global solvers. Moreover, our
technique is effective beyond classical local-global solvers, and can be
applied to iterative methods with a common structure. We evaluate the
performance of our technique on a variety of geometry optimization and physics
simulation problems. Our approach significantly reduces the number of
iterations required to compute an accurate result, with only a slight increase

a promising tool for accelerating existing algorithms as well as designing

different, and by proper design of the nanostructures, one may tune the

the convergence rate for strongly convex functions is not geometric for the

we used a replica exchange Monte Carlo method, known as Parallel Tempering, to
calculate the thermodynamic quantities of the system. We have obtained the
staggered magnetization $q$, the associated magnetic susceptibility ($\chi$)
and the specific heat $c$, to characterize the universality class of the
system. At the low-temperature limit, we have obtained a continuous phase
transition with a critical temperature around $T_{c} \approx 1.4116$ for a
particular modulation of the lattice according to the Fibonacci letter
sequence. In addition, we have used finite-size scaling relations with
logarithmic corrections to estimate the critical exponents $\beta$, $\gamma$

$\hat{\alpha}$ and $\hat{\lambda}$. Our results show that the system obeys the
Ising model universality class and that the critical behavior has logarithmic

smoothly upon the variation of particle number or interaction strength. On the

longitudinal confinement. We found that such modes might be unobservable in the

efficient texture descriptors. However, LBP has some notable limitations,
mostly the sensitivity to noise. In this paper, we address these criteria by
introducing a novel texture descriptor, Robust Adaptive Median Binary Pattern
(RAMBP). RAMBP based on classification process of noisy pixels, adaptive
analysis window, scale analysis and image regions median comparison. The
proposed method handles images with high noisy textures, and increases the
discriminative properties by capturing microstructure and macrostructure
texture information. The proposed method has been evaluated on popular texture
datasets for classification and retrieval tasks, and under different high noise
conditions. Without any train or prior knowledge of noise type, RAMBP achieved
the best classification compared to state-of-the-art techniques. It scored more
than $90\%$ under $50\%$ impulse noise densities, more than $95\%$ under
Gaussian noised textures with standard deviation $\sigma = 5$, and more than
$99\%$ under Gaussian blurred textures with standard deviation $\sigma = 1.25$.
The proposed method yielded competitive results and high performance as one of
the best descriptors in noise-free texture classification. Furthermore, RAMBP
showed also high performance for the problem of noisy texture retrieval
providing high scores of recall and precision measures for textures with high

photoelectron spectroscopy (TRXAS and TRXPS, respectively) of the prototypical
unsaturated organic chromophore, ethylene, following excitation to its S2

ensuing dynamics. These X-ray spectroscopies provide a clear signature of the
wavepacket dynamics near conical intersections, related to charge localization
effects driven by the nuclear dynamics. Given the ubiquity of charge

two-dimensional noncentrosymmetric superconductors under an external magnetic
field $B$. Rashba superconductors, surface superconductivity on the surface of
three-dimensional topological insulators, and transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMD) are representative systems, and the current-voltage $I$-$V$
characteristics, i.e., $V=V(I)$, for each of them is analyzed. $V(I)$ can be
expanded with respect to the current $I$ as $V(I)= \sum_{j=1,\infty} a_j(B,T)
I^j$, and the $(B,T)$-dependence of $a_j$ depends on the mechanism of the
charge transport. Above the mean field transition temperature $T_0$, the
fluctuation of the superconducting order parameter gives the additional
conductivity, i.e., paraconductivity. Extending the analysis to the nonlinear
response, we obtain the nonreciprocal charge transport expressed by $a_2(B,T) =
a_1(T) \gamma(T) B$, where $\gamma$ converges to a finite value at $T=T_0$.
Below $T_0$, the vortex motion is relevant to the voltage drop, and the
dependence of $a_j$ on $B,T$ is different depending on the system and
mechanisms. For the superconductors under the in-plane magnetic field, the
Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition occurs at $T_{\rm KT}$. In this case
$\gamma$ has the characteristic temperature dependences such as $\gamma \sim
(T-T_{\rm KT})^{-3/2}$ near $T_{\rm KT}$. On the other hand, for TMD with
out-plane magnetic field, the KT transition is gone, and there are two possible
mechanisms for the nonreciprocal response. One is the anisotropy of the damping
constant for the motion of the vortex. In this case, $a_1(B) \sim B$ and
$a_2(B) \sim B^2$. The other one is the ratchet potential acting on the vortex
motion, which gives $a_1(B) \sim B$ and $a_2(B) \sim B$. Based on these
results, we propose the experiments to identify the mechanism of the
nonreciprocal charge transport.

retrieval due to its diverse patterns, i.e., a document could be relevant to a
query as a whole or partially as long as it provides sufficient information for
users' need. Such diverse relevance patterns require an ideal retrieval model
to be able to assess relevance in the right granularity adaptively.
Unfortunately, most existing retrieval models compute relevance at a single
granularity, either document-wide or passage-level, or use fixed combination
strategy, restricting their ability in capturing diverse relevance patterns. In
this work, we propose a data-driven method to allow relevance signals at
different granularities to compete with each other for final relevance
assessment. Specifically, we propose a HIerarchical Neural maTching model
(HiNT) which consists of two stacked components, namely local matching layer
and global decision layer. The local matching layer focuses on producing a set
of local relevance signals by modeling the semantic matching between a query
and each passage of a document. The global decision layer accumulates local
signals into different granularities and allows them to compete with each other
to decide the final relevance score. Experimental results demonstrate that our
HiNT model outperforms existing state-of-the-art retrieval models significantly
on benchmark ad-hoc retrieval datasets.

regions, while the $\lambda$ Orionis cloud has a different environment as a
consequence of the interaction with a prominent OB association and a giant Hii
region. PGCCs in the $\lambda$ Orionis cloud have higher dust temperatures
($Td=16.13\pm0.15$ K) and lower values of dust emissivity spectral index ($
\beta=1.65\pm0.02$) than PGCCs in the Orion A (Td=13.79$\pm 0.21$K,
$\beta=2.07\pm0.03$) and Orion B ($Td=13.82\pm0.19$K, $\beta=1.96\pm0.02$)

them as cores. Of total 119 cores, 15 cores are discovered in the $\lambda$
Orionis cloud, while 74 and 30 cores are found in the Orion A and B clouds,
respectively. The cores in the $\lambda$ Orionis cloud show much lower mean
values of size R=0.08 pc, column density N(H2)=$(9.5\pm1.2) \times 10^{22}$
cm$^{-2}$, number density n(H2)=$(2.9 \pm 0.4)\times10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$, and mass

be attributed to the photodissociation and external heating by the nearby Hii
region, which may prevent the PGCCs from forming gravitationally bound

annihilation searches in very-high-energy $\gamma$-rays. The central region of
the Milky Way halo is one of the most promising targets given its large amount
of DM and proximity to Earth. We report on a search for a monoenergetic
spectral line from self-annihilations of DM particles in the energy range from
300 GeV to 70 TeV using a two-dimensional maximum likelihood method taking
advantage of both the spectral and spatial features of signal versus
background. The analysis makes use of Galactic Center (GC) observations
accumulated over ten years (2004 - 2014) with the H.E.S.S. array of
ground-based Cherenkov telescopes. No significant $\gamma$-ray excess above the
background is found. We derive upper limits on the annihilation cross section
$\langle\sigma v\rangle$ for monoenergetic DM lines at the level of
$\sim4\times10^{-28}$ cm$^{3}$s$^{-1}$ at 1 TeV, assuming an Einasto DM profile
for the Milky Way halo. For a DM mass of 1 TeV, they improve over the previous
ones by a factor of six. The present constraints are the strongest obtained so
far for DM particles in the mass range 300 GeV - 70 TeV. Ground-based
$\gamma$-ray observations have reached sufficient sensitivity to explore
relevant velocity-averaged cross sections for DM annihilation into two
$\gamma$-ray photons at the level expected from the thermal relic density for
TeV DM particles.

cover the vertex set of $H$. Let $t_{k-1}(n, F)$ be the smallest integer $t$
such that every $k$-graph $H$ on $n$ vertices with minimum codegree at least
$t$ contains a perfect $F$-tiling. Mycroft (JCTA, 2016) determined the
asymptotic values of $t_{k-1}(n, F)$ for $k$-partite $k$-graphs $F$. Mycroft
also conjectured that the error terms $o(n)$ in $t_{k-1}(n, F)$ can be replaced
by a constant that depends only on $F$. In this paper, we improve the error
term of Mycroft's result to a sub-linear term when $F=K^3(m)$, the complete
$3$-partite $3$-graph with each part of size $m$. We also show that the
sub-linear term is tight for $K^3(2)$, {the result also provides another family
of counterexamples of Mycroft's conjecture (Gao, Han, Zhao (arXiv, 2016) gave a
family of counterexamples when $H$ is a $k$-partite $k$-graph with some

edges $A, B, C, D$ with $A\cup B= C\cup D$ and $A\cap B=C\cap D=\emptyset$),

theories was discovered. What is special for these black hole solutions is that
the scalarization is not due to the presence of matter, but {it is induced} by
the curvature of spacetime itself. Moreover, more than one branch of scalarized
solutions can bifurcate from the Schwarzschild branch, and these scalarized
branches are characterized by the number of nodes of the scalar field. The next
step is to consider the linear stability of these solutions, which is
particularly important due to the fact that the Schwarzschild black holes lose
stability at the first point of bifurcation. Therefore we here study in detail
the radial perturbations of the scalarized EGB black holes. The results show
that all branches with a nontrivial scalar field with one or more nodes are
unstable. The stability of the solutions on the fundamental branch, whose
scalar field has no radial nodes, depends on the particular choice of the
coupling function between the scalar field and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. We
consider two particular cases based on the previous studies of the background
solutions. If this coupling has the form used in \cite{Doneva:2017bvd} the
fundamental branch of solutions is stable, except for very small masses. In the
case of a coupling function quadratic in the scalar field \cite{Silva:2017uqg},
though, the whole fundamental branch is unstable.

enhanced ionization rates. Using a recent theory for the addition of cosmic
ray-induced reactions to astrochemical models, we calculated the radiochemical
yields, called $G$ values, for the primary dust grain ice-mantle constituents.
We show that the inclusion of this non-thermal chemistry can lead to the
formation of complex organic molecules from simpler ice-mantle constituents,
even under cold core conditions. In addition to enriching ice-mantles, we find
that these new radiation-chemical processes can lead to increased gas-phase
abundances as well, particularly for HOCO, NO$_2$, HC$_2$O, methyl formate
(HCOOCH$_3$), and ethanol (CH$_3$CH$_2$OH). These model results imply that HOCO
- and perhaps NO$_2$ - might be observable in TMC-1. Future detections of
either of these two species in cold interstellar environments could provide
strong support for the importance of cosmic ray-driven radiation chemistry. The
increased gas-phase abundance of methyl formate can be compared with abundances
achieved through other formation mechanisms such as pure gas-phase chemistry
and three-body surface reactions.

dead-zone, and where vortices can develop through the Rossby Wave Instability
(RWI). It has been suggested that self-gravity can significantly affect the
evolution of such vortices. We present the results of 2D hydrodynamical
simulations of the evolution of vortices forming at a pressure bump in
self-gravitating discs with Toomre parameter in the range $4-30$. We consider
isothermal plus non-isothermal disc models that employ either the classical
$\beta$ prescription or a more realistic treatment for cooling. The main aim is
to investigate whether the condensating effect of self-gravity can stabilize
vortices in sufficiently massive discs. We confirm that in isothermal disc
models with ${\cal Q} \gtrsim 15$, vortex decay occurs due to the vortex
self-gravitational torque. For discs with $3\lesssim {\cal Q} \lesssim 7$, the
vortex develops gravitational instabilities within its core and undergoes
gravitational collapse, whereas more massive discs give rise to the formation
of global eccentric modes. In non-isothermal discs with $\beta$ cooling, the
vortex maintains a turbulent core prior to undergoing gravitational collapse
for $\beta \lesssim 0.1$, whereas it decays if $\beta \ge 1$. In models that
incorpore both self-gravity and a better treatment for cooling, however, a
stable vortex is formed with aspect ratio $\chi \sim 3-4$. Our results indicate
that self-gravity significantly impacts the evolution of vortices forming in
protoplanetary discs, although the thermodynamical structure of the vortex is
equally important for determining its long-term dynamics.

real-world problems. However, injecting human knowledge into an RL agent may
require extensive effort and expertise on the human designer's part. To date,
human factors are generally not considered in the development and evaluation of
possible RL approaches. In this article, we set out to investigate how
different methods for injecting human knowledge are applied, in practice, by
human designers of varying levels of knowledge and skill. We perform the first
empirical evaluation of several methods, including a newly proposed method
named SASS which is based on the notion of similarities in the agent's
state-action space. Through this human study, consisting of 51 human
participants, we shed new light on the human factors that play a key role in
RL. We find that the classical reward shaping technique seems to be the most
natural method for most designers, both expert and non-expert, to speed up RL.
However, we further find that our proposed method SASS can be effectively and
efficiently combined with reward shaping, and provides a beneficial alternative
to using only a single speedup method with minimal human designer effort
overhead.

persists over a long period of time before usual coarsening of domains takes
over and eventually takes the system to equilibrium. By studying the

processors that supports searches, insertions and deletions. In both versions,
the total work of all operations when the map has size at least p is bounded by
the working-set bound, i.e., the cost of an item depends on how recently it was
accessed (for some linearization): accessing an item in the map with recency r
takes O(1+log r) work. In the simpler version each map operation has O((log
p)^2+log n) span (where n is the maximum size of the map). In the pipelined
version each map operation on an item with recency r has O((log p)^2+log r)
span. (Operations in parallel may have overlapping span; span is additive only
for operations in sequence.)
  Both data structures are designed to be used by a dynamic multithreading
parallel program that at each step executes a unit-time instruction or makes a
data structure call. To achieve the stated bounds, the pipelined data structure
requires a weak-priority scheduler, which supports a limited form of 2-level

  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first parallel implementation of a
self-adjusting search structure where the cost of an operation adapts to the

complicated because patients deviate from the protocol. Where such deviations
are relevant for the estimand, we are typically required to make an untestable
assumption about post-deviation behaviour in order to perform our primary
analysis and estimate the treatment effect. In such settings, it is now widely
recognised that we should follow this with sensitivity analyses to explore the
robustness of our inferences to alternative assumptions about post-deviation
behaviour. Although there has been a lot of work on how to conduct such
sensitivity analyses, little attention has been given to the appropriate loss
of information due to missing data within sensitivity analysis. We argue more
attention needs to be given to this issue, showing it is quite possible for
sensitivity analysis to decrease and increase the information about the
treatment effect. To address this critical issue, we introduce the concept of
information-anchored sensitivity analysis. By this we mean sensitivity analysis
in which the proportion of information about the treatment estimate lost due to
missing data is the same as the proportion of information about the treatment
estimate lost due to missing data in the primary analysis. We argue this forms
a transparent, practical starting point for interpretation of sensitivity
analysis. We then derive results showing that, for longitudinal continuous
data, a broad class of controlled and reference-based sensitivity analyses
performed by multiple imputation are information-anchored. We illustrate the
theory with simulations and an analysis of a peer review trial, then discuss
our work in the context of other recent work in this area. Our results give a

Upon La doping, the low temperature S-Pbca space group of the parent compound

changes to the atomic positions within the unit cell. These changes can be
characterised in terms of the local RuO$_6$ octahedral coordination: with
increasing doping the structure, crudely speaking, evolves from an orthorhombic
unit cell with compressed octahedra to a quasi-tetragonal unit cell with
elongated ones. The magnetic structure on the other hand, is found to be
robust, with the basic $k=(0,0,0)$, $b$-axis antiferromagnetic order of the

$x\approx0.11$. The only effects of La doping on the magnetic structure are to
suppress the A-centred mode, favouring the B mode instead, and to reduce the

transition has been developed, whereby the system is formulated as a nonlinear
complementarity problem (NCP). Unlike the widely used primary variable
switching (PVS) method which requires a drastic reduction of the time step size
when a phase appears or disappears, this approach is more robust and allows for
larger time steps. One way to solve an NCP system is to reformulate the
inequality constraints as a non-smooth equation using a complementary function
(C-function). Because of the non-smoothness of the constraint equations, a
semi-smooth Newton method needs to be developed. In this work, we consider two
methods for solving NCP systems used to model multiphase flow: (1) a
semi-smooth Newton method for two C-functions: the minimum and the
Fischer-Burmeister functions, and (2) a new inexact Newton method based on the
Jacobian smoothing method for a smooth version of the Fischer-Burmeister
function. We show that the new method is robust and efficient for standard
benchmark problems as well as for realistic examples with highly heterogeneous
media such as the SPE10 benchmark.

using first-principles calculations. A new approach to spincaloric properties
is presented that circumvents the linear response approximation inherent in the

supports two different temperatures in the two electrodes and provides the
exact current and/or voltage response of the system. Moreover, it accounts for
temperature-dependent chemical potentials in the electrodes and finite-bias

qualitatively correct results, even if the variations of the chemical
potentials are small. It is shown how the spincaloric properties can be
tailored by the choice of the growth conditions. We find a large effective and
spin-dependent Seebeck coefficient of $-65$ $\mu$V/K at room temperature for
the purely Co-terminated interface. We suggest to use such interfaces in
thermally operated magnetoresistive random access memory modules, which exploit
the magneto-Seebeck effect, to maximize the thermally induced readout voltage.

states leading to a pronounced increase of the precession amplitude by one
order of magnitude at the center of the Brillouin zone, i.e. when the

discs vortices are subject to destructive `elliptic instabilities', which
reduces their viability as dust traps. The survival of vortices in 3D accretion
discs is thus an important issue to address. In this work, we perform shearing
box simulations to show that disc self-gravity enhances the survival of 3D
vortices, even when self-gravity is weak in the classic sense (e.g. with a
Toomre $Q\simeq5$). We find a 3D, self-gravitating vortex can grow on secular
timescales in spite of the elliptic instability. The vortex aspect-ratio
decreases as it strengthens, which feeds the elliptic instability. The result
is a 3D vortex with a turbulent core that persists for $\sim 10^{3}$ orbits. We
find when gravitational and hydrodynamic stresses become comparable, the vortex
may undergo episodic bursts, which we interpret as interaction between elliptic
and gravitational instabilities. We estimate the distribution of dust particles
in self-gravitating, turbulent vortices. Our results suggest large-scale

temperature. In cuprate family, the Y-, Bi-, Hg- and Tl-based systems have
superconducting transition temperatures exceeding the liquid nitrogen boiling
temperature (~77K). However, the toxic elements Hg and Tl in the latter two
systems strongly constrain the possible applications. The Bi-based (2223)
system is nontoxic, but the irreversibility magnetic field is strongly
suppressed in the liquid nitrogen temperature region. For this purpose, the
best perspective so far is relying on the YBa2Cu3O7 (Tc~90 K) system which is
nontoxic and has a relatively high irreversibility magnetic field. Here we
report the study of a nontoxic superconductor (Cu,C)Ba2Ca3Cu4O11+{\delta} with

important role in a plethora of technologies. Because the pore size is
typically smaller than the mean free path of gas molecules, their flow is
conventionally described by the Knudsen theory that assumes diffuse reflection
(random-angle scattering) at confining walls. This assumption has proven to
hold surprisingly well in experiment, and only a few cases of partially
specular (mirror-like) reflection are known. Here we report gas transport
through angstrom-scale channels with atomically-flat walls and show that
surface scattering can be both diffuse or specular, depending on fine details
of the surface atomic landscape, and quantum effects contribute to the
specularity at room temperature. The channels made from graphene or boron
nitride allow a helium gas flow that is orders of magnitude faster than
expected from the theory. This is explained by specular surface scattering,
which leads to ballistic transport and frictionless gas flow. Similar channels
but with molybdenum disulfide walls exhibit much slower permeation that remains
well described by Knudsen diffusion. The difference is attributed to stronger
atomic corrugations at MoS2 surfaces, which are similar in height to the size
of transported atoms and their de Broglie wavelength. The importance of the
latter, matter-wave contribution is corroborated by the observation of a
reversed isotope effect in which the mass flow of hydrogen is notably higher
than that of deuterium, in contrast to the relation expected for classical
flows. Our results provide insights into atomistic details of molecular
permeation, which so far could be accessed only in simulations, and show a
possibility of studying gas transport under a controlled confinement comparable

to something commonly referred to as 'open governance'. Though a disputed term,
we take open governance to mean a concept, which encourages and facilitates
openness, accountability, and responsiveness to citizens. For the success of
open governance initiatives, there are some technologies, such as the internet,
that are crucial. These technologies enable access to both the data and to
engagement activities between citizens and government. There are also other
technologies, like blockchain and smart contacts, which could be utilised to
assist open governance. A sound starting point would be moving from a system
where information is tediously released by a government, on an 'as they please'
basis, to an infrastructure where critical actions are captured with strong
integrity, non-repudiation and evidential guarantees. With an added dimension
that facilitates these actions record be accessible to public scrutiny in near
real-time. One candidate technology for capturing such actions is blockchain.
The blockchains utility is being recognised through smart contracts -
potentially a vital building block to realising open and transparent government
activities. In this paper, we employ the concept of smart contracts to
government tendering activities. The proposed scheme is based on smart
contracts, enabling a fair, transparent and independently verifiable
(auditable) government tendering scheme. The scheme is then implemented on the
Ethereum platform to evaluate the performance and financial cost implications,
along with an evaluation of the potential security and auditability challenges.

dwarf (WD) cooling sequence on the color-magnitude diagram (CMD). Some of this
substructure stems from the diversity of WD atmospheric compositions, but the
CMD remains bimodal even when only spectroscopically-confirmed DA WDs are
considered. We develop a generative model to predict the CMD for DA WDs as a
function of the initial mass function (IMF), stellar age distribution, and a
flexibly parameterized IFMR. We then fit the CMD of 1100 bright DA WDs within
100 pc, for which atmospheric composition and completeness are well-understood.
The resulting best-fit IFMR flattens at $3.5 \lesssim m_{\rm
in}/M_{\odot}\lesssim 5.5$, producing a secondary peak in the WD mass
distribution at $m_{\rm WD} \sim 0.8 M_{\odot}$. Our IFMR is broadly consistent
with weaker constraints obtained from binaries and star clusters in previous
work but represents the clearest observational evidence obtained to date of
theoretically-predicted non-linearity in the IFMR. A visibly bimodal CMD is
only predicted for mixed-age stellar populations: in single-age clusters, more
massive WDs reach the bottom of the cooling sequence before the first
lower-mass WDs appear. This may explain why bimodal cooling sequences have thus
far evaded detection in cluster CMDs.

condition in the $Z$ and $U$ variable. This includes settings of linear,
quadratic and exponential growths in those variables.
  Extending an idea of Cheridito and Nam to the jump setting and applying
comparison theorems for L\'evy-driven BSDEs, we show existence, uniqueness,
boundedness and Malliavin differentiability of a solution. The pivotal
assumption to obtain these results is a boundedness condition on the terminal
value $\xi$ and its Malliavin derivative $D\xi$.
  Furthermore, we extend existence and uniqueness theorems to cases where the
generator is not even locally Lipschitz in $U.$ BSDEs of the latter type find
use in exponential utility maximization.

real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the discovered attacks

of Edimax smartplugs can lead to another wave of Mirai attacks, which can be
either botnets or worm attacks. To systematically understand the damage of the

even if the signal can be reconstructed with a small error from an information
theoretic point of view, known algorithms fail unless the noise-to-signal ratio
is sufficiently small. This hard phase is typically understood as a metastable
branch of the dynamical evolution of message passing algorithms. In this work
we study the metastable branch for a prototypical inference problem, the
low-rank matrix factorization, that presents a hard phase. We show that for
noise-to-signal ratios that are below the information theoretic threshold, the
posterior measure is composed of an exponential number of metastable glassy
states and we compute their entropy, called the complexity. We show that this
glassiness extends even slightly below the algorithmic threshold below which
the well-known approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm is able to closely
reconstruct the signal. Counter-intuitively, we find that the performance of
the AMP algorithm is not improved by taking into account the glassy nature of
the hard phase. This result provides further evidence that the hard phase in
inference problems is algorithmically impenetrable for some deep computational
reasons that remain to be uncovered.

measured for different UV lines. The results show that i) the spatial structure
of the NLR is complex. The [OIII]5007 line shows significant velocity offsets
with respect to the systemic redshift of the source. Different components at
different velocities (-670, -100, + 75 km s^-1) are produced in different
regions of the source. ii) we detect both the narrow and the broad components
of the Hbeta line. The narrow component generally follows the kinematics of the
[OIII] line, while the broad component is significantly blue-shifted. The peak
of the broad line is near the blue end, or possibly outside of the sensitivity
band of the instrument, implying a velocity offset of >~1800 km s^-1. This
result is in agreement with the interpretation of the QSO as a GW recoiling
black hole. The properties of the NLR show that the observed outflows are most
likely the effect of radiation pressure on the (photoionized) gas in the

The measurement principle is explained and its theory is derived. Both
contributions, the direct reflected light from retroreflectors as well as the
scattered light from the lunar surface are considered. The measurement results
from the Sixties until 2007 are then compared between different LLR stations
and with the theoretical forecast. The very first experiment was in 1962: a
laser beam was directed to the Moon and the scattered light from the lunar
surface was detected. The number of received photons was in line with the
theory. Then from 1969 the laser beams were directed to retroreflectors placed
by Apollo astronauts and Luna space crafts. Retroreflectors are on the one hand
reference points for long term measurements; on the other hand they deliver a
much stronger return signal compared to the scattered return. But none of the
stations could measure the expected amplification of the retroreflectors. The
number of received photons remained in line with measurements to the bare
surface of the Moon. Therefore either all retroreflectors have degraded such
that their return signals fit to the scattered return from the lunar soil or
the measurements were indeed taken to the lunar surface only.

dynamics of asteroid rotation when it moves in elliptic orbit through Space.
According to the results of Efroimsky, Frouard (2016), various perturbations
(collisions, close encounters, YORP effect) destabilize the rotation of a small
body (asteroid), deviating it from the initial-current spin state. This yields
evolution of the spin towards rotation about maximal-inertia axis due to the
process of nutation relaxation or to the proper spin state corresponding to
minimal energy with a fixed angular momentum. We consider in our research the
aforementioned spin state of asteroid but additionally under non-vanishing
influence of the effects of non-gravitational nature (YORP effect), which is
destabilizing the asteroid rotation during its motion far from giant planets.
Meanwhile, new solutions for asteroid rotation dynamics in case of negligible
(time-dependent) applied torques have been obtained in our development. New
method for solving Euler equations for rigid body rotation is suggested; an
elegant example for evolution of spin towards the rotation about
maximal-inertia axis is calculated.

so that the local matching identity of each patch contributes to the global

steps. First, based on the signature, the local matching identity and the
corresponding matching score of each patch are computed. Then, a fully

to combine the global matching identity of each patch and obtain a final

archive to analyze the long-term evolution of umbral and penumbal area. We
developed an 'automated algorithm' to uniquely identify the sunspot umbra

the increase of sunspot area upto 100 msh but eventually settles down to a

(about 150 Kelvin). While such ""resistor"" can cool its environment when it is
AC coupled to a resistor, the thermally cooling effect is only academically
interesting. The importance of the invention is of another nature: In low-noise
electronics, it is essential to have resistors with low noise temperature to
improve the signal-to-noise ratio. A natural question is raised: can we use a
linear system with feedback to cool and, most importantly, to show reduced
noise temperature? Exploring this problem, were able to produce standalone
linear resistors showing strongly reduced thermal noise. Our must successful

have been immersed in liquid helium. We also found that there is an old
solution offering similar results utilizing the virtual ground of an inverting
amplifier at negative feedback. There the ""cold"" resistor is generated at the

flows of a certain demand in a capacitated network from their current paths to
their respective new paths, in a congestion-free manner and fast. This
scheduling problem has applications in traffic engineering in communication
networks and has recently received much attention in software-defined networks,
in which updates are distributed over an asynchronous network by a software
controller. However, existing algorithms for this problem either have a
super-polynomial runtime or only compute feasible schedules, which do not
provide any guarantees on the length of the rerouting schedule.
  This paper presents the first polynomial-time algorithm for computing
shortest update schedules to reroute flows in a congestion-free manner. We
contribute an almost tight characterization of the polynomial-time tractability
of the problem: We present the first polynomial-time solution for this problem
for two flows, but also show that even the question whether a feasible update
schedule exists, is already NP-hard for six flows.
  In fact, the presented algorithm runs in linear time and is hence not only
optimal in terms of scheduling but also asymptotically optimal in terms of
runtime.

alternative choice to the half integer spin fermions, appearing in Clifford

$\gamma^a$ and $\tilde{\gamma}^a$ --- for the description of spins and charges
(first) and family quantum numbers (second), offers the explanation for not
only the appearance of families but also for all the properties of quarks and

fields in $d \ge(13+1)$ --- the spin connections $\omega_{ab \alpha}$ (of the

shown beyond doubt that NSMs produce beamed SHBs. Its low luminosity and other

cannonball model of gamma ray bursts. Low luminosity (LL) SHBs are mainly
ordinary SHBs viewed far off-axis. They are produced mainly by nearby NSMs.
Because of beaming, most of the NSMs, including those within the current
horizon of Ligo-Virgo, produce SHBs most of which are invisible from Earth.
But, their pulsar wind nebula powered by the spin down of the remnant neutron
star produces an early-time isotropic afterglow with a universal temporal
shape. This smoking gun of NSMs is detectable independent of whether the SHB
was visible, or was invisible from Earth because of being beamed away.

  overlap with arXiv:1804.00242",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spatial misalignment caused by variations in poses and viewpoints is one of
the most critical issues that hinders the performance improvement in existing
person re-identification (Re-ID) algorithms. To address this problem, in this
paper, we present a robust and efficient graph correspondence transfer (REGCT)
approach for explicit spatial alignment in Re-ID. Specifically, we propose to
establish the patch-wise correspondences of positive training pairs via graph
matching. By exploiting both spatial and visual contexts of human appearance in
graph matching, meaningful semantic correspondences can be obtained. To
circumvent the cumbersome \emph{on-line} graph matching in testing phase, we
propose to transfer the \emph{off-line} learned patch-wise correspondences from
the positive training pairs to test pairs. In detail, for each test pair, the
training pairs with similar pose-pair configurations are selected as
references. The matching patterns (i.e., the correspondences) of the selected
references are then utilized to calculate the patch-wise feature distances of
this test pair. To enhance the robustness of correspondence transfer, we design
a novel pose context descriptor to accurately model human body configurations,
and present an approach to measure the similarity between a pair of pose
context descriptors. Meanwhile, to improve testing efficiency, we propose a
correspondence template ensemble method using the voting mechanism, which
significantly reduces the amount of patch-wise matchings involved in distance
calculation. With aforementioned strategies, the REGCT model can effectively
and efficiently handle the spatial misalignment problem in Re-ID. Extensive
experiments on five challenging benchmarks, including VIPeR, Road, PRID450S,
3DPES and CUHK01, evidence the superior performance of REGCT over other
state-of-the-art approaches.

method is to use different line segments only in the hypervolume contribution
region for the hypervolume contribution approximation. Comparing with a
traditional method which is based on the R2 indicator to approximate the
hypervolume, the new method can directly approximate the hypervolume
contribution and will utilize all the direction vectors only in the hypervolume
contribution region. The new method, the traditional method and the Monte Carlo
sampling method together with two exact methods are compared through
comprehensive experiments. Our results show the advantages of the new method
over the other methods. Comparing with the other two approximation methods, the
new method achieves the best performance for comparing hypervolume
contributions of different solutions and identifying the solution with the
smallest hypervolume contribution. Comparing with the exact methods, the new
method is computationally efficient in high-dimensional spaces where the exact
methods are impractical to use.

  ""What Comes Beyond the Standard Models"", Bled, 09-17 of July, 2017",,,,"physics.gen-ph hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate bosonization/fermionization for free massless fermions being
equivalent to free massless bosons with the purpose of checking and correcting
the old rule by Aratyn and one of us (H.B.F.N.) for the number of boson species
relative to the number of fermion species which is required to have
bosonization possible. An important application of such a counting of degrees
of freedom relation would be to invoke restrictions on the number of families
that could be possible under the assumption, that all the fermions in nature
are the result of fermionizing a system of boson species. Since a theory of
fundamental fermions can be accused for not being properly local because of
having anticommutativity at space like distances rather than commutation as is
more physically reasonable to require, it is in fact called for to have all
fermions arising from fermionization of bosons. To make a realistic scenario
with the fermions all coming from fermionizing some bosons we should still have
at least some not fermionized bosons and we are driven towards that being a
gravitational field, that is not fermionized. Essentially we reach the
spin-charge-families theory by one of us (N.S.M.B.) with the detail that the
number of fermion components and therefore of families get determined from what
possibilities for fermionization will finally turn out to exist. The
spin-charge-family theory has long been plagued by predicting 4 families rather
than the phenomenologically more favoured 3. Unfortunately we do not yet
understand well enough the unphysical negative norm square components in the
system of bosons that can fermionize in higher dimensions because we have no
working high dimensional case of fermionization. But suspecting they involve
gauge fields with complicated unphysical state systems the corrections from
such states could putatively improve the family number prediction.

resources in a large variety of scientific disciplines. One of the strongest
criticisms to this paradigm is the limited reproducibility of the process,
especially at largely oversubscribed facilities. In this and in a subsequent
paper we address this specific aspect in a quantitative way, through a
statistical study on proposal ranking at the European Southern Observatory. For
this purpose we analysed a sample of about 15000 proposals, submitted by more
than 3000 Principal Investigators over 8 years. The proposals were reviewed by
more than 500 referees, who assigned over 140000 grades in about 200 panel
sessions. After providing a detailed analysis of the statistical properties of
the sample, the paper presents an heuristic model based on these findings,
which is then used to provide quantitative estimates of the reproducibility of
the pre-meeting process. On average, about one third of the proposals ranked in
the top quartile by one referee are ranked in the same quartile by any other
referee of the panel. A similar value is observed for the bottom quartile. In
the central quartiles, the agreement fractions are very marginally above the
value expected for a fully aleatory process (25%). The agreement fraction
between two panels composed by 6 referees is 55+/-5% (50% confidence level) for
the top and bottom quartiles. The corresponding fraction for the central
quartiles is 33+/-5%. The model predictions are confirmed by the results
obtained from boot-strapping the data for sub-panels composed by 3 referees,
and fully consistent with the NIPS experiment. The post-meeting phase will be
presented and discussed in a forthcoming paper.

begin by reviewing classical methods for finding suitable quadrature points for
polynomial approximation in both the univariate and multivariate setting. Then,
we categorize recent advances into those that propose a new sampling approach
and those centered on an optimization strategy. The sampling approaches yield a
favorable discretization of the domain, while the optimization methods pick a
subset of the discretized samples that minimize certain objectives. While not
all strategies follow this two-stage approach, most do. Sampling techniques
covered include subsampling quadratures, Christoffel, induced and Monte Carlo
methods. Optimization methods discussed range from linear programming ideas and
Newton's method to greedy procedures from numerical linear algebra. Our
exposition is aided by examples that implement some of the aforementioned
strategies.

distance, which has received a broad attention due to its low storage cost and
fast retrieval speed. With the rapid development of deep learning, deep hashing
methods have achieved promising results in efficient information retrieval.
Most of the existing deep hashing methods adopt pairwise or triplet losses to
deal with similarities underlying the data, but the training is difficult and
less efficient because $O(n^2)$ data pairs and $O(n^3)$ triplets are involved.
To address these issues, we propose a novel deep hashing algorithm with unary
loss which can be trained very efficiently. We first of all introduce a Unary
Upper Bound of the traditional triplet loss, thus reducing the complexity to
$O(n)$ and bridging the classification-based unary loss and the triplet loss.
Second, we propose a novel Semantic Cluster Deep Hashing (SCDH) algorithm by
introducing a modified Unary Upper Bound loss, named Semantic Cluster Unary
Loss (SCUL). The resultant hashcodes form several compact clusters, which means
hashcodes in the same cluster have similar semantic information. We also
demonstrate that the proposed SCDH is easy to be extended to semi-supervised
settings by incorporating the state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning
algorithms. Experiments on large-scale datasets show that the proposed method
is superior to state-of-the-art hashing algorithms.

been investigated through literary texts and, more recently, social media.
However, differences pertaining to language use in search engines has not been
thoroughly analyzed, especially for age and gender differences. Such
differences are important especially due to the growing use of search engine
data in the study of human health, where queries are used to identify patient
populations.
  Using data from multiple general-purpose Internet search engines gathered
over a period of one month we investigate the correlation between demography
(age, gender, and income) and the text of queries submitted to search engines.
  Our results show that females and younger people use longer queries. This
difference is such that females make approximately 25% more queries with 10 or
more words. In the case of queries which identify users as having specific
medical conditions we find that females make 50% more queries than expected,
and that this results in patient cohorts which are highly skewed in gender and
age, compared to known gender balance.
  Our results indicate that studies where demographic representation is
important, such as in the study of health aspect of users or when search
engines are evaluated for fairness, care should be taken in the selection of
search engine data so as to create a representative dataset.

well-managed parallel processing technique is needed for improving the
performance of the system. However, the specific properties of pattern
operators in the CEP systems increase the difficulties of the parallel
processing problem. To address these issues, a parallelization model and an
adaptive parallel processing strategy are proposed for the complex event
processing by introducing a histogram, and utilizing the probability and queue
theory. The proposed strategy can estimate the optimal event splitting policy,
which can suit the most recent workloads conditions such that the selected
policy has the least expected waiting time for further processing the arriving
events. The proposed strategy can keep the CEP system running fast under the
