of the luminosities of the young stellar objects are significantly different.
While the luminosity distribution in W51 is consistent with Galaxy-wide

practical blind adaptive analog nonlinear filter to efficiently detect and
mitigate impulsive noise. Specially, we design an Adaptive Canonical
Differential Limiter (ACDL) which is constructed from a Clipped Mean Tracking
Filter (CMTF) and Quartile Tracking Filters (QTFs). The QTFs help to determine
a real-time range that excludes outliers. This range is fed into the CMTF which
is responsible for mitigating impulsive noise. The CMTF is a nonlinear analog
filter and its nonlinearity is controlled by the aforementioned range. Proper
selection of this range ensures the improvement of the desired signal quality
in impulsive environment. It is important to note that the proposed ACDL
behaves like a linear filter in case of no impulsive noise. In this context,
the traditional matched filter construction is modified to ensure
distortionless processing of the desired signal. The performance improvement of
the proposed ACDL is due to the fact that unlike other nonlinear methods, the
ACDL is implemented in the analog domain where the outliers are still broadband
and distinguishable. Simulation results in PRIME (OFDM-based narrowband PLC
system) demonstrate the superior BER performance of ACDL relative to other
nonlinear approaches such as blanking and clipping in impulsive noise
environments.

  Dependent Attribute Based Inference Control Problem",,,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Relational DBMSs continue to dominate the database market, and inference
problem on external schema of relational DBMS's is still an important issue in
terms of data privacy.Especially for the last 10 years, external schema
construction for application-specific database usage has increased its
independency from the conceptual schema, as the definitions and implementations
of views and procedures have been optimized. This paper offers an optimized
decomposition strategy for the external schema, which concentrates on the
privacy policy and required associations of attributes for the intended user
roles. The method proposed in this article performs a proactive decomposition
of the external schema, in order to satisfy both the forbidden and required
associations of attributes.Functional dependency constraints of a database
schema can be represented as a graph, in which vertices are attribute sets and
edges are functional dependencies. In this representation, inference problem
can be defined as a process of searching a subtree in the dependency graph
containing the attributes that need to be related. The optimized decomposition
process aims to generate an external schema, which guarantees the prevention of
the inference of the forbidden attribute sets while guaranteeing the
association of the required attribute sets with a minimal loss of possible
association among other attributes, if the inhibited and required attribute
sets are consistent with each other. Our technique is purely proactive, and can
be viewed as a normalization process. Due to the usage independency of external
schema construction tools, it can be easily applied to any existing systems
without rewriting data access layer of applications. Our extensive experimental
analysis shows the effectiveness of this optimized proactive strategy for a
wide variety of logical schema volumes.

experiments. A new method to approximately reconstruct the neutrinos from the
hadronic decays of $\tau^-\tau^+$ pairs produced at $e^-e^+$ tau factories is
proposed. With all final state particle momenta available, observables based on
matrix elements and sensitive to BSM are calculated. It is estimated that with

new precision can effectively constrain BSM models with heavy mirror neutrinos.
It can also constrain models containing a light scalar with mass at $O$(1 GeV),

models, especially in natural language processing. In this paper, we present a
theoretical framework for understanding the effect of dimensionality on vector
embeddings. We observe that the distributional hypothesis, a governing
principle of statistical semantics, requires a natural unitary-invariance for
vector embeddings. Motivated by the unitary-invariance observation, we propose
the Pairwise Inner Product (PIP) loss, a unitary-invariant metric on the
similarity between two embeddings. We demonstrate that the PIP loss captures
the difference in functionality between embeddings, and that the PIP loss is
tightly connect with two basic properties of vector embeddings, namely
similarity and compositionality. By formulating the embedding training process
as matrix factorization with noise, we reveal a fundamental bias-variance
trade-off between the signal spectrum and noise power in the dimensionality
selection process. This bias-variance trade-off sheds light on many empirical
observations which have not been thoroughly explained, for example the
existence of an optimal dimensionality. Moreover, we discover two new results
about vector embeddings, namely their robustness against over-parametrization
and their forward stability. The bias-variance trade-off of the PIP loss
explicitly answers the fundamental open problem of dimensionality selection for
vector embeddings.

regions distributed mainly along the spiral arms and the co-rotation ring
around the bar. We have identified 72 star forming knots in the disk, of which
only two are in the inter-arm regions and 6 in the co-rotation ring. We have
tabulated their positions and estimated their luminosities, sizes, star
formation rates, colors, ages and masses. The ages and masses of these star
forming knots were estimated using the Starburst99 stellar evolutionary
synthesis models. The star forming knots have FUV and NUV mean sizes of 485 pc

the physico-chemical properties of the involved interfaces. The production of
surfactant molecules by bacteria is a widespread strategy that allows the
colony to efficiently expand over the substrate. On the one hand, surfactant
molecules lower the surface tension of the colony, effectively increasing the
wettability of the substrate, which facilitates spreading. On the other hand,
gradients in the surface concentration of surfactant molecules result in
Marangoni flows that drive spreading. These flows may cause an instability of
the circular colony shape and the subsequent formation of fingers. In this
work, we study the effect of bacterial surfactant production and substrate
wettability on colony growth and shape within the framework of a hydrodynamic
thin film model. We show that variations in the wettability and surfactant
production are sufficient to reproduce four different types of colony growth,
which have been described in the literature, namely, arrested and continuous
spreading of circular colonies, slightly modulated front lines and the
formation of pronounced fingers.

existence of stable resonant configurations and signified by the existence of
stable periodic solutions and oscillation of critical (resonant) angles. When
such an oscillation takes place around a value different than 0 or $\pi$, the
libration is called asymmetric. In the context of the planar circular
restricted three-body problem (CRTBP), asymmetric librations have been
identified for the exterior mean-motion resonances (MMRs) 1:2, 1:3 etc. as well
as for co-orbital motion (1:1). In exterior MMRs the massless body is the outer
one. In this paper, we study asymmetric librations in the 3-dimensional space.
We employ the computational approach of Markellos (1978) and compute families
of asymmetric periodic orbits and their stability. Stable, asymmetric periodic
orbits are surrounded in phase space by domains of initial conditions which
correspond to stable evolution and librating resonant angles. Our computations
were focused on the spatial circular restricted three-body model of the
Sun-Neptune-TNO system (TNO= trans-Neptunian object). We compare our results
with numerical integrations of observed TNOs, which reveal that some of them
perform 1:2-resonant, inclined asymmetric librations. For the stable 1:2 TNOs
librators, we find that their libration seems to be related with the vertically
stable planar asymmetric orbits of our model, rather than the 3-dimensional
ones found in the present study.

for a warped astrophysical disc using a warped shearing box formalism. A
perturbation expansion of these equations to first order in the warping
amplitude leads to a linear theory for the internal local structure of
magnetised warped discs in the absence of MRI turbulence. In the special case
of an external magnetic field oriented normal to the disc surface these
equations are solved semi-analytically via a spectral method. The relatively
rapid warp propagation of low-viscosity Keplerian hydrodynamic warped discs is
diminished by the presence of a magnetic field. The magnetic tension adds a
stiffness to the epicyclic oscillations, detuning the natural frequency from
the orbital frequency and thereby removing the resonant forcing of epicyclic
modes characteristic of hydrodynamic warped discs. In contrast to a single
hydrodynamic resonance we find a series of Alfv\'{e}nic-epicyclic modes which
may be resonantly forced by the warped geometry at critical values of the
orbital shear rate $q$ and magnetic field strength. At these critical points
large internal torques are generated and anomalously rapid warp propagation
occurs. As our treatment omits MRI turbulence, these results are of greatest
applicability to strongly magnetised discs.

measurement results -- their discreetness and randomness. Emblematic of these
features is Bohr's idea of quantum jumps between two discrete energy levels of
an atom. Experimentally, quantum jumps were first observed in an atomic ion
driven by a weak deterministic force while under strong continuous energy
measurement. The times at which the discontinuous jump transitions occur are
reputed to be fundamentally unpredictable. Can there be, despite the
indeterminism of quantum physics, a possibility to know if a quantum jump is
about to occur or not? Here, we answer this question affirmatively by
experimentally demonstrating that the jump from the ground to an excited state
of a superconducting artificial three-level atom can be tracked as it follows a
predictable ""flight,"" by monitoring the population of an auxiliary energy level
coupled to the ground state. The experimental results demonstrate that the jump
evolution when completed is continuous, coherent, and deterministic.
Furthermore, exploiting these features and using real-time monitoring and
feedback, we catch and reverse a quantum jump mid-flight, thus
deterministically preventing its completion. Our results, which agree with
theoretical predictions essentially without adjustable parameters, support the
modern quantum trajectory theory and provide new ground for the exploration of
real-time intervention techniques in the control of quantum systems, such as
early detection of error syndromes.

order to adapt graph-cut minimisation to first order logic, we employ a
suitable structural distance for measuring the distance between sets of logical

caching mechanism and the Hoeffding bound, a statistical tool to approximate
globally-optimal decisions from locally-optimal ones. We evaluate our approach

as achiral, based on the quantum-mechanical theory of molecular optical
activity. The one-electron theory is insufficient to describe optical activity
in crystals, where spatial variation of polarization states along the light
propagation direction is crucial in dimensions exceeding molecules. Such
spatial-dispersion, which can drastically modify the optical near-field in
plasmonic nanocrystals, has yet to be experimentally proved at the nanometer
scale. Here, the experimental observation of natural circular dichroism of
surface plasmons in spherical gold, silver, and copper nanocrystals in solution
is presented. It originates from spatial dispersion (nonlocality) occurred at a
dimension as small as 5 nanometers in the optical region. In particular, the
electromagnetic pressure or longitudinal volume plasmons result in phase-shift
and polarization rotation of the transverse electric field of incident light.
Dipolar surface plasmons exhibit negative ellipticity and corresponding
negative phase-shift of the electric field (i.e., optically left-handed),
whereas quadrupolar surface plasmons have positive signs in both ellipticity
and phase-shift (i.e., optically right-handed). Structural effects such as
nanocrystal assembly, nanocrystal shape, electron spin-polarization, and
plasmon-molecule interaction are accessed. Volume plasmons inside the
nanocrystal also produce a positive rotational strength for the interband
transition. This study implicates optical symmetry-breaking in isotropic

plausible equations of state (EOSs) for compact stars for matter that is either
purely hadronic or that exhibits a phase transition. In particular, we produce
two classes of EOSs with and without phase transitions, each containing one
million EOSs. We then impose constraints on the maximum mass, ($M < 2.16
M_{\odot}$), and on the dimensionless tidal deformability ($\tilde{\Lambda}
<800$) deduced from GW170817, together with recent suggestions of lower limits
on $\tilde{\Lambda}$. Exploiting more than $10^9$ equilibrium models for each
class of EOSs, we produce distribution functions of all the stellar properties
and determine, among other quantities, the radius that is statistically most
probable for any value of the stellar mass. In this way, we deduce that the
radius of a purely hadronic neutron star with a representative mass of
$1.4\,M_{\odot}$ is constrained to be $12.00\!<\!R_{1.4}/{\rm km}\!<\!13.45$ at
a $2$-$\sigma$ confidence level, with a most likely value of
$\bar{R}_{1.4}=12.39\,{\rm km}$; similarly, the smallest dimensionless tidal
deformability is $\tilde{\Lambda}_{1.4}\!>\!375$, again at a $2$-$\sigma$
level. On the other hand, because EOSs with a phase transition allow for very
compact stars on the so-called `twin-star' branch, small radii are possible
with such EOSs although not probable, i.e. $8.53\!<\!R_{1.4}/{\rm
km}\!<\!13.74$ and $\bar{R}_{1.4}=13.06\,{\rm km}$ at a $2$-$\sigma$ level,
with $\tilde{\Lambda}_{1.4}\!>\!35.5$ at a $3$-$\sigma$ level. Finally, since
these EOSs exhibit upper limits on $\tilde{\Lambda}$, the detection of a binary
with total mass of $3.4\,M_{\odot}$ and $\tilde{\Lambda}_{1.7}\!>\!461$ can
rule out twin-star solutions.

bright points has been analyzed. The focus was on the temporal evolution of the
mean brightness before and during coronal jet events. In the absolute majority
of the cases either single or recurrent coronal jets were preceded by slight
precursor disturbances observed in the mean intensity curves. The key
conclusion is that we were able to detect quasi-periodical oscillations with
characteristic periods from sub-minute up to 3-4 min values in the bright point
brightness which precede the jets. Our basic claim is that along with the
conventionally accepted scenario of bright point evolution through new magnetic
flux emergence and its reconnection with the initial structure of the bright
point and the coronal hole, certain MHD oscillatory and wave-like motions can
be excited and these can take an important place in the observed dynamics.
These quasi-oscillatory phenomena might play the role of links between
different epochs of the coronal jet ignition and evolution. They can be an
indication of the MHD wave excitation processes due to the system entropy
variations, density variations or shear flows. It is very likely a sharp
outflow velocity transverse gradients at the edges between the open and closed
field line regions. We suppose that magnetic reconnections can be the source of
MHD waves due to impulsive generation or rapid temperature variations, and
shear flow driven nonmodel MHD wave evolution (self-heating and/or
overreflection mechanisms).

manifold, we consider a sub-Hilbert space spanned by states which are
parameterized by spatial metric. In those states, metric is introduced as a
collective variable that controls local structures of entanglement. The
underlying matter fields endow the states labeled by metric with an unambiguous
inner product. Then we construct a Hamiltonian for the matter fields that is an
endomorphism of the sub-Hilbert space, thereby inducing a quantum Hamiltonian
of the metric. It is shown that there exists a matter Hamiltonian that induces
the general relativity in the semi-classical field theory limit. Although the
Hamiltonian is not local in the absolute sense, it has a weaker notion of
locality, called relative locality : the range of interactions is set by the
entanglement present in target states on which the Hamiltonian acts. In
general, normalizable states are not invariant under the transformations
generated by the Hamiltonian. As a result, a physical state spontaneously
breaks the Hamiltonian constraint, and picks a moment of time. The subsequent
flow of time can be understood as a Goldstone mode associated with the broken
symmetry. The construction allows one to study dynamics of gravity from the
perspective of matter fields. The Hawking radiation corresponds to a unitary
evolution where entanglement across horizon is gradually transferred from color
degrees of freedom to singlet degrees of freedom. The underlying quantum states
remain pure as evaporating black holes keep entanglement with early Hawking
radiations in the singlet sector which is not captured by the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.

Telescope in the framework of the Reionization Lensing Cluster Survey (RELICS).
We use the Light-Traces-Mass modeling technique to uncover sets of multiply
imaged galaxies and constrain the mass distribution of the clusters. Our SL
analysis reveals that both clusters have particularly large Einstein radii
($\theta_E>30""$ for a source redshift of $z_s=2$), providing fairly large areas
with high magnifications, useful for high-redshift galaxy searches ($\sim2$
arcmin$^{2}$ with $\mu>5$ to $\sim1$ arcmin$^{2}$ with $\mu>10$, similar to a
typical \textit{Hubble Frontier Fields} cluster). We also find that MACS
J0308.9+2645 hosts a promising, apparently bright (J$\sim23.2-24.6$ AB),

the brightest high-redshift candidates found in RELICS. Our mass models,
including magnification maps, are made publicly available for the community

three-band transition from the occupied Weyl band to the empty Weyl band via an
intermediate band away from the Weyl cone, for excitations both by linearly and
circularly polarized lights. Therefore, it is significant to sum over all

not suffice to only consider the two-band direct transition within a Weyl cone.
Calculated photoconductivities are well consistent with recent experiment

detailed spectroscopic analysis of 14 stars drawn from two stellar

Persistent-photoconductivity (PPC), previously studied in the phase-change

response is observed in the pure GeTe compound and when alloying GeTe with
either In or Mn. Films made from these compounds share the same
crystallographic structure, the same p-type conductivity, a similar
compositional disorder extending over mesoscopic scales, and similar mosaic
morphology. The enhanced PPC response exhibited by the Sb and Bi alloys may
therefore be related to their common chemistry. PPC is observable in GeBiTe
films at the entire range of sheet resistances studied in this work. The excess
conductance produced by a brief exposure to infrared illumination decays with
time as a stretched-exponential (Kohlrausch law). Intrinsic electron-glass
effects on the other hand, are observable in thin films of GeBiTe only for
samples that are strongly-localized just like it was noted with the seven
electron-glasses previously studied. These include a memory-dip which is the
defining attribute of the phenomenon. The memory-dip in GeBiTe is the widest
among the germanium-telluride alloys studied to date consistent with the high
carrier-concentration of this compound. The thermalization process exhibited in
either, the PPC-state or in the electron-glass regime is sluggish but the
temporal law of the relaxation from the out-of-equilibrium state is distinctly
different. Coexistence of the two phenomena give rise to some non-trivial
effects, in particular, the visibility of the memory-dip is enhanced in the
PPC-state. The relation between this effect and the dependence of the
memory-effect magnitude on the ratio between the interparticle-interaction and

the French mathematician Gaspard Monge (1746-1818): A worker with a shovel in
hand has to move a large pile of sand lying on a construction site. The goal of
the worker is to erect with all that sand a target pile with a prescribed shape
(for example, that of a giant sand castle). Naturally, the worker wishes to
minimize her total effort, quantified for instance as the total distance or
time spent carrying shovelfuls of sand. Mathematicians interested in OT cast
that problem as that of comparing two probability distributions, two different
piles of sand of the same volume. They consider all of the many possible ways
to morph, transport or reshape the first pile into the second, and associate a
""global"" cost to every such transport, using the ""local"" consideration of how
much it costs to move a grain of sand from one place to another. Recent years
have witnessed the spread of OT in several fields, thanks to the emergence of
approximate solvers that can scale to sizes and dimensions that are relevant to
data sciences. Thanks to this newfound scalability, OT is being increasingly
used to unlock various problems in imaging sciences (such as color or texture
processing), computer vision and graphics (for shape manipulation) or machine
learning (for regression, classification and density fitting). This short book
reviews OT with a bias toward numerical methods and their applications in data
sciences, and sheds lights on the theoretical properties of OT that make it
particularly useful for some of these applications.

their mergers with other IMBHs or with stellar BHs in the cluster are mostly
emitted in frequencies <10 Hz, which unfortunately is out of reach for current
ground-based observatories such as advanced LIGO (aLIGO). Nevertheless, we show
that aLIGO measurements can be used to efficiently probe one of the possible
formation mechanisms of IMBHs in GCs, namely a runaway merger process of
stellar seed BHs. In this case, aLIGO will be sensitive to the lower-mass rungs
of the merger ladder, ranging from the seed BH mass to masses >~50-300 Msun,
where the background from standard mergers is expected to be very low. Assuming
this generic IMBH formation scenario, we calculate the mass functions that
correspond to the limiting cases of possible merger trees. Based on estimates
for the number density of GCs and taking into account the instrumental
sensitivity, we show that current observations do not effectively limit the
occupation fraction f_occ of IMBHs formed by runaway mergers of stellar BHs in
GCs. However, we find that a six-year run of aLIGO at design sensitivity will
be able to probe down to f_occ<3% at a 99.9% confidence level, either finding
evidence for this formation mechanism, or necessitating others if the fraction
of GCs that harbor IMBHs is higher.

  We study the evolution of the photometric and structural scaling relations
found between the parameters of the surface brightness profiles in the
rest-frame R-band of Type-III S0 galaxies with z and the possible differences
between the rest-frame (B-R) colours of the inner and outer disc profiles.
  We make use of a sample of 14 Type-III E/S0--S0 galaxies at 0.2<z<0.6 to
study if the correlations found in local Type-III S0 galaxies were present ~6
Gyr ago. We analyse the distribution of the surface brightness characteristic
parameters as a function of the stellar mass and if there is a significant
change with z. We also derive their rest-frame (B-R) colour profiles and we
compare these results with the predictions from a grid of SSP models.
  We find that the inner and outer scale-lengths of Type-III S0 galaxies at
0.4<z<0.6 follow compatible trends and scaling relations with those observed in
local S0 galaxies. We do not detect any significant differences between the
location of Rbreak between z~0.6 and z=0 for a fixed stellar mass of the

dimmer in the local Universe than at z~0.6 for a fixed stellar mass.
  In contrast to Type-II profiles, the Type-III surface brightness profiles of
S0 galaxies present compatible Rbreak values and scaling relations during the

outer discs point to a highly scalable and stable formation process, probably
more related to gravitational and dynamical processes than to the evolution of
stellar populations (abridged).

losing mass in part to photoevaporation driven by high energy irradiance from
the host star. This process may ultimately overcome viscous accretion to
disperse the disc and halt migrating giants by starving their orbits of gas,
imprinting on giant planet separations in evolved systems. Inversion of this
distribution could then give insight into whether stellar FUV, EUV or X-ray
flux dominates photoevaporation, constraining planet formation and disc
evolution models. We use a 1D hydrodynamic code in population syntheses for gas
giants undergoing Type II migration in a viscously evolving disc subject to
either a primarily FUV, EUV or X-ray flux from a pre-solar T Tauri star. The
photoevaporative mass loss profile's unique peak location and width in each
energetic regime produces characteristic features in the distribution of giant
separations: a severe dearth of $\lesssim$ 2 M$_{\rm J}$ planets interior to 5
AU in the FUV scenario, a sharp concentration of $\lesssim$ 3 M$_{\rm J}$
planets between $\approx 1.5 - 2$ AU in the EUV case, and a relative abundance
of $\approx 2 - 3.5$ M$_{\rm J}$ giants interior to 0.5 AU in the X-ray model.
These features do not resemble the observational sample of gas giants with mass
constraints, though our results do show some weaker qualitative similarities.
We thus assess how the differing photoevaporative profiles interact with
migrating giants and address the effects of large model uncertainties as a step
to better connect disc models with trends in the exoplanet population.

complementing approach asks for full tomographic knowledge. Compressed sensing
techniques achieve full tomography of quantum channels essentially at optimal
resource efficiency. So far, guarantees for compressed sensing protocols rely
on unstructured random measurements and can not be applied to the data acquired

or not the favourable features of both worlds can be combined. In this work, we
give a positive answer to this question. For the important case of
characterising multi-qubit unitary gates, we provide a rigorously guaranteed

number of average gate fidelities measured respect to random Clifford
unitaries. Moreover, for general unital quantum channels we provide an explicit
expansion into a unitary 2-design, allowing for a practical and guaranteed
reconstruction also in that case. As a side result, we obtain a new statistical
interpretation of the unitarity -- a figure of merit that characterises the

(SPIRITS) of a likely supernova (SN) in NGC 3556 at only 8.8 Mpc, which,
despite its proximity, was not detected by optical searches. A luminous
infrared (IR) transient at $M_{[4.5]} = -16.7$ mag (Vega), SPIRITS 16tn is
coincident with a dust lane in the inclined, star-forming disk of the host.
Using IR, optical, and radio observations, we attempt to determine the nature
of this event. We estimate $A_V \approx$ 8 - 9 mag of extinction, placing it
among the three most highly obscured IR-discovered SNe to date. The [4.5] light
curve declined at a rate of 0.013 mag day$^{-1}$, and the $[3.6] - [4.5]$ color
grew redder from 0.7 to $\gtrsim$ 1.0 mag by 184.7 days post discovery.
Optical/IR spectroscopy shows a red continuum, but no clearly discernible
features, preventing a definitive spectroscopic classification. Deep radio
observations constrain the radio luminosity of SPIRITS 16tn to $L_{\nu}
\lesssim 10^{24}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ between 3 - 15 GHz, excluding many
varieties of radio core-collapse SNe. A type Ia SN is ruled out by the observed
red IR color, and lack of features normally attributed to Fe-peak elements in
the optical and IR spectra. SPIRITS 16tn was fainter at [4.5] than typical
stripped-envelope SNe by $\approx$ 1 mag. Comparison of the spectral energy
distribution to SNe II suggests SPIRITS 16tn was both highly obscured, and
intrinsically dim, possibly akin to the low-luminosity SN 2005cs. We infer the
presence of an IR dust echo powered by a peak luminosity of the transient of $5
\times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1} < L_{\mathrm{peak}} < 4\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$,
consistent with the observed range for SNe II. This discovery illustrates the
power of IR surveys to overcome the compounding effects of visible extinction
and optically sub-luminous events in completing the inventory of nearby SNe.

formed. In this paper, we investigate under which conditions planetesimals
already form during the disk buildup stage, in which gas and dust fall onto the

evolution. We find that under most conditions planetesimals only form after the
buildup stage when the disk becomes less massive and less hot. However, there
are parameters for which planetesimals already form during the disk buildup.
This occurs when the viscosity driving the disk evolution is intermediate
($\alpha_v \sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$) while the turbulent mixing of the dust is
reduced compared to that ($\alpha_t \le 0.03 \cdot \alpha_v$), and with the
assumption that water vapor is vertically well-mixed with the gas. Such
$\alpha_t \ll \alpha_v$ scenario could be expected for layered accretion, where
the gas flow is mostly driven by the active surface layers, while the midplane

primordial substructure to the stars and the gas by simplistically modelling
the star formation process so as to obtain a variety of substructure

measuring the virial ratio of the stars alone (disregarding the gas
completely), we can estimate how much mass a star cluster will retain after gas
expulsion to within 10% accuracy, no matter how complex the background
structure of the gas is, and we present a simple analytical recipe describing
this behaviour. We show that the evolution of the star cluster while still
embedded in the natal gas, and the behavior of the gas before being expelled,
are crucial processes that affect the timescale on which the cluster can evolve
into a virialized spherical system. Embedded star clusters that have high
levels of substructure are subvirial for longer times, enabling them to survive
gas expulsion better than a virialized and spherical system. By using a more
realistic treatment for the background gas than our previous studies, we find
it very difficult to destroy the young clusters with instantaneous gas
expulsion. We conclude that gas removal may not be the main culprit for the
dissolution of young star clusters.

accounting for the precise form of the neutrino momentum distribution. Our

the exact formulae give results that differ by $\sim$50%, compared with
approximate ones where neutrinos are assumed to be at rest. We also find that
spectral distortion due to absorption is more important for heavy neutrino
masses (by a factor of $\sim$10 going from a neutrino mass of 0.01 eV to 0.1
eV). By analyzing the CMB spectral data measured with COBE-FIRAS, we obtain
lower limits on the neutrino lifetime of $\tau_{12} \gtrsim 4 \times 10^{21}$ s

interestingly, the verbal part of the GRE score has a higher predictive power

student GPA does not correlate with success (there is even a slight negative
slope in the relationship between GPA and the probability of success). This
counterintuitive observation is explained once undergraduate institutions are

higher probability to succeed. Finally, a gender gap is observed in the
probability to succeed with female students having a lower probability to

compare a quantum transition state theory to explicit ring polymer molecular

is to inhibit, not to enhance, diffusivity at intermediate temperatures in
constrast to the usual polaron picture of hopping. We then address the trapping
of hydrogen by a vacancy as a prototype lattice defect. By a sequence of steps
in a thought experiment, each involving a thermodynamic integration, we are
able to separate out the binding free energy of a proton to a defect into
harmonic and anharmonic, and classical and quantum contributions. We find that
about 30% of a typical binding free energy of hydrogen to a lattice defect in

encounter the demand for a sharp distinction between the classical and quantum

advocates for a quickly evolving, mildly relativistic ejecta associated with

central star for some viewing geometries. For these so-called AA Tau-like
variables, the obscuring material is located in the inner disk and absorption
spectroscopy allows one to characterize its dust and gas content. Since the
observed emission from CTTS consists of several components (photospheric,
accretion, jet, and disk emission), which can all vary with time, it is
generally challenging to disentangling disk features from emission variability.
Multi-epoch, flux-calibrated, broadband spectra provide us with the necessary
information to cleanly separate absorption from emission variability. We
applied this method to three epochs of VLT/X-Shooter spectra of the CTTS V354
Mon (CSI Mon-660) located in NGC 2264 and find that: (a) the accretion emission
remains virtually unchanged between the three epochs; (b) the broadband flux
evolution is best described by disk material obscuring part of the star, and
(c) the Na and K gas absorption lines show only a minor increase in equivalent
width during phases of high dust extinction. The limits on the absorbing gas
column densities indicate a low gas-to-dust ratio in the inner disk, less than
a tenth of the ISM value. We speculate that the evolutionary state of V354 Mon,
rather old with a low accretion rate, is responsible for the dust excess
through an evolution toward a dust dominated disk or through the fragmentation
of larger bodies that drifted inward from larger radii in a still gas dominated
disk.

The effects of channel state information (CSI) availability on secrecy outage

closed-form expressions are derived. Diversity is achieved from the direct and
relaying paths both at the destination and at the eavesdropper by combinations

asymptotic analysis is provided when each hop SNR is the same in the balanced
case and when it is different in the unbalanced case. The analysis shows that
both hops can be a bottleneck for secure communication; however, they do not
affect the secrecy identically. While it is observed that CSI knowledge can
improve secrecy, the amount of improvement for SOP is more when the required
rate is low and for ESR when the operating SNR is also low. It is also shown
that the source to eavesdropper link SNR is more crucial for secure

quality fails to attain a certain information rate, thereby improving the
spectral efficiency. The path gain is assumed to be log-normally distributed
with very high distance dependent signal attenuation. Furthermore, the additive
noise is modeled as a Bernoulli-Gaussian process to incorporate the effects of
impulsive noise contents. Closed-form expressions for the outage probability
and the fraction of times the relay is in use, and an approximate closed-form

the scaffolds, whole scaffold calculations of the local shear forces are
computationally-intensive. Instead, representative volume elements (RVEs),
which are obtained by extracting smaller portions of the scaffold, are commonly
used in literature without a numerical accuracy standard. Hence, the goal of
this study is to examine how closely the whole scaffold simulations are
approximated by the two types of boundary conditions used to enable the RVEs:
""wall boundary condition"" (WBC) and ""periodic boundary condition"" (PBC). To
that end, Lattice-Boltzmann Method fluid dynamics simulations were used to
model the surface shear stresses in 3D scaffold reconstructions, obtained from
high resolution microcomputed tomography images. It was found that despite the
RVEs being sufficiently larger than 6 times the scaffold pore size (which is
the only accuracy guideline found in literature), the stresses were still
significantly under-predicted by both types of boundary conditions: between 20
and 80% average error, depending on the scaffold's porosity. Moreover, it was
found that the error grew with higher porosity. This is likely due to the small
pores dominating the flow field, and thereby negating the effects of the
unrealistic boundary conditions, when the scaffold porosity is small. Finally,
it was found that the PBC was always more accurate and computationally
efficient than the WBC. Therefore, it is the recommended type of RVE. Overall,
this work provides a previously-unavailable guidance to researchers regarding
the best choice of boundary conditions for RVE simulations.

analysed the effects of those encounters on the binary system. It was found
that only 22% of the encounters with the giant planets were strong enough to

source, relay, destination and eavesdropper is analyzed. The
threshold-selection decode-and-forward relay is considered, where the relay can
correctly decode and forward only if it satisfies a threshold signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR). Both destination and eavesdropper take advantage of the direct and
relayed transmissions through maximal ratio diversity combining. The secrecy
outage probability (SOP) and ergodic secrecy rate are derived in closed-form
for different channel state information (CSI) availability. It was observed
that when the required rate is low, having CSI knowledge is more advantageous
than in the case of higher rate. An increase in the required threshold SNR at
the relay can increase the SOP if the relayed link SNR is relatively higher
than the direct link SNR. It was also shown that SOP cannot be improved beyond
a certain value when keeping either dual-hop link average SNR fixed and
increasing the other link SNR, whereas the ergodic secrecy rate can be
increased by keeping the source to destination average SNR fixed.

characterize their dynamical states and their anatomical and functional

Here, we develop a general theory for the emergence of correlated neuronal
activity from the dynamics in strongly recurrent networks consisting of several
populations of binary neurons. We apply this theory to the case in which the
connectivity depends on the anatomical or functional distance between the
neurons. We establish the architectural conditions under which the system
settles into a dynamical state where correlations are strong, highly robust and
spatially modulated. We show that such strong correlations arise if the network
exhibits an effective feedforward structure. We establish how this feedforward
structure determines the way correlations scale with the network size and the
degree of the connectivity. In networks lacking an effective feedforward
structure correlations are extremely small and only weakly depend on the number
of connections per neuron. Our work shows how strong correlations can be
consistent with highly irregular activity in recurrent networks, two key
features of neuronal dynamics in the central nervous system.

space valued stochastic differential equations (SDE) that is uniform with
respect to initial conditions in bounded subsets of the Banach space. A key
step in the proof is showing that a uniform large deviation principle over
compact sets is implied by a uniform over compact sets Laplace principle.
Because bounded subsets of infinite dimensional Banach spaces are in general
not relatively compact in the norm topology, we embed the Banach space into its
double dual and utilize the weak-$\star $ compactness of closed bounded sets in
the double dual space. We prove that a modified version of our stochastic
differential equation satisfies a uniform Laplace principle over weak-$\star $
compact sets and consequently a uniform over bounded sets large deviation
principle. We then transfer this result back to the original equation using a
contraction principle. The main motivation for this uniform LDP is to
generalize results of Freidlin and Wentzell concerning the behavior of finite
dimensional SDEs. Here we apply the uniform LDP to study the asymptotics of
exit times from bounded sets of Banach space valued small noise SDE, including
reaction diffusion equations with multiplicative noise and $2$-dimensional

overcomes the limitations of an individual adversarial training objective and
always preserves the best offspring, contributing to progress in and the

In this paper, we model the headway distance (the distance between the head of
a vehicle and the head of its follower) equal to the sum of a constant hardcore
distance and an exponentially distributed random variable. We study the mean,
the variance and the skewness of interference at the origin with this
deployment model. Even though the pair correlation function becomes
complicated, we devise simple formulae to capture the impact of hardcore
distance on the variance of interference in comparison with a PPP model of
equal intensity. In addition, we study the extreme scenario where the

$\alpha$-attractors can be written as quintessence models with a potential that

general threshold model in social networks: local monotonicity and
submodularity imply global monotonicity and submodularity. That is, if the
threshold function of every node is monotone and submodular, then the spread
function $\sigma(S)$ is monotone and submodular, where $S$ is a seed set and
the spread function $\sigma(S)$ denotes the expected number of active nodes at
termination of a diffusion process starting from $S$. The correctness of this
conjecture has been proved by Mossel and Roch. In this paper, we first provide
the concept AD-k (Alternating Difference-$k$) as a generalization of
monotonicity and submodularity. Specifically, a set function $f$ is called \adk
if all the $\ell$-th order differences of $f$ on all inputs have sign
$(-1)^{\ell+1}$ for every $\ell\leq k$. Note that AD-1 corresponds to
monotonicity and AD-2 corresponds to monotonicity and submodularity. We propose
a refined version of KKT's conjecture: in the general threshold model, local
AD-k implies global AD-k. The original KKT conjecture corresponds to the case
for AD-2, and the case for AD-1 is the trivial one of local monotonicity
implying global monotonicity. By utilizing continuous extensions of set
functions as well as social graph constructions, we prove the correctness of
our conjecture when the social graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
Furthermore, we affirm our conjecture on general social graphs when $k=\infty$.

question in modern integer programming research. One would like to find CGFs
that are simultaneously good, i.e., there are good guarantees for the cutting
planes they generate, and efficient, meaning that the values of the CGFs can be
computed cheaply (with procedures that have some hope of being implemented in
current solvers). We investigate in this paper to what extent this balance can
be struck. We propose a family of CGFs which, in a sense, achieves this harmony
between good and efficient. In particular, we provide a parameterized family of
$b+\Z^n$ free sets to derive CGFs from and show that our proposed CGFs give a
good approximation of the closure given by CGFs obtained from all maximal
$b+\Z^n$ free sets and their so-called trivial liftings, and simultaneously,
show that these CGFs can be computed with explicit, efficient procedures. We
provide a constructive framework to identify these sets as well as computing
their trivial lifting. We follow it up with computational experiments to
demonstrate this and to evaluate their practical use. Our proposed family of
cuts seem to give some tangible improvement on randomly generated instances
compared to GMI cuts; however, in MIPLIB 3.0 instances, and vertex cover and
stable problems on random graph instances, their performance is poor.

exact exchange-correlation potential of time-dependent density functional
theory are crucial for accurately capturing time-resolved dynamics of electron
scattering in a model one-dimensional system. Approximate functionals used
today miss these structures and con- sequently underestimate the scattering
probability. The dynamics can vary significantly depending on the choice of the
initial Kohn-Sham state, and, with a judicious choice, a recently-proposed
non-adiabatic ap- proximation provides extremely accurate dynamics on approach
to the target but this ultimately also fails to capture reflection accurately.
Here we provide more details, using a model of electron-He + as illustration,
in both the inelastic and elastic regimes. In the elastic case, the
time-resolved picture is contrasted with the time-independent picture of
scattering, where the linear response theory of TDDFT can be used to extract
transmission and reflection coefficients. Although the exact functional yields
identical scattering probabil- ities when used in this way as it does in the
time-resolved picture, we show that the currently-available approximate
functionals do not, even when they have the correct asymptotic behavior.

train a classifier from only a handful of labeled examples. Recent progress in
few-shot classification has featured meta-learning, in which a parameterized
model for a learning algorithm is defined and trained on episodes representing
different classification problems, each with a small labeled training set and
its corresponding test set. In this work, we advance this few-shot
classification paradigm towards a scenario where unlabeled examples are also
available within each episode. We consider two situations: one where all
unlabeled examples are assumed to belong to the same set of classes as the
labeled examples of the episode, as well as the more challenging situation
where examples from other distractor classes are also provided. To address this
paradigm, we propose novel extensions of Prototypical Networks (Snell et al.,
2017) that are augmented with the ability to use unlabeled examples when
producing prototypes. These models are trained in an end-to-end way on
episodes, to learn to leverage the unlabeled examples successfully. We evaluate
these methods on versions of the Omniglot and miniImageNet benchmarks, adapted
to this new framework augmented with unlabeled examples. We also propose a new
split of ImageNet, consisting of a large set of classes, with a hierarchical
structure. Our experiments confirm that our Prototypical Networks can learn to
improve their predictions due to unlabeled examples, much like a
semi-supervised algorithm would.

sets becomes a hot yet challenging problem. Hashing is expected to be an
efficient solution, since it represents data as binary codes. As the bit-wise
XOR operations can be fast handled, the retrieval time is greatly reduced. Few
existing multimodal hashing methods consider the correlation among hashing
bits. The correlation has negative impact on hashing codes. When the hashing
code length becomes longer, the retrieval performance improvement becomes
slower. In this paper, we propose a minimum correlation regularization (MCR)
for multimodal hashing. First, the sigmoid function is used to embed the data
matrices. Then, the MCR is applied on the output of sigmoid function. As the

can offload its computation to one among multiple servers. In particular, we
minimize the system-wide computation overhead by jointly optimizing the
individual computation decisions, transmit power of the users, and computation
resource at the servers. The crux of the problem lies in the combinatorial
nature of multi-user offloading decisions, the complexity of the optimization
objective, and the existence of inter-cell interference. Then, we decompose the
underlying problem into two subproblems: i) the offloading decision, which
includes two phases of user association and subchannel assignment, and ii)
joint resource allocation, which can be further decomposed into the problems of
transmit power and computation resource allocation. To enable distributed
computation offloading, we sequentially apply a many-to-one matching game for
user association and a one-to-one matching game for subchannel assignment.
Moreover, the transmit power of offloading users is found using a bisection
method with approximate inter-cell interference, and the computation resources
allocated to offloading users is achieved via the duality approach. The
proposed algorithm is shown to converge and is stable. Finally, we provide
simulations to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm as well as

uses the harvested laser energy to communicate with a ground station. To
maintain the UAV's sustainable operation, its total energy consumption cannot

harvesting constraint, we maximize the downlink communication throughput from
the UAV to the ground station over a finite time duration, by jointly
optimizing the UAV's trajectory and its transmit power allocation. However, due

considered as a major breakthrough in the synthesis of novel 2D systems. To
gain insight into the exfoliation possibility of MAX phases and to identify
which MAX phases are promising candidates for successful exfoliation into 2D
MXenes, we perform extensive electronic structure and phonon calculations, and
determine the force constants, bond strengths, and static exfoliation energies
of MAX phases to MXenes for 82 different experimentally synthesized crystalline
MAX phases. Our results show a clear correlation between the force constants
and the bond strengths. As the total force constant of an ""A"" atom contributed
from the neighboring atoms is smaller, the exfoliation energy becomes smaller,
thus making exfoliation easier. We propose 37 MAX phases for successful
exfoliation into 2D Ti$_2$C, Ti$_3$C$_2$, Ti$_4$C$_3, $Ti$_5$C$_4$, Ti$_2$N,

explore the effect of charge injection on MAX phases. We find that the injected
charges, both electrons and holes, are mainly received by the transition
metals. This is due to the electronic property of MAX phases that the states
near the Fermi energy are mainly dominated by $d$ orbitals of the transition
metals. For negatively charged MAX phases, the electrons injected cause
swelling of the structure and elongation of the bond distances along the $c$
axis, which hence weakens the binding. For positively charged MAX phases, on
the other hand, the bonds become shorter and stronger. Therefore, we predict
that the electron injection by electrochemistry or gating techniques can
significantly facilitate the exfoliation possibility of MAX phases to 2D
MXenes.

with a notoriously expensive pre-processing step of data transformation and

automatically infer transformations using simple examples that users provide as
hints. However, an important usability issue - verification - limits the
effective use of such PBE data transformation systems, since the verification
process is often effort-consuming and unreliable. We propose a data
transformation paradigm design CLX (pronounced ""clicks"") with a focus on
facilitating verification for end users in a PBE-like data transformation. CLX
performs pattern clustering in both input and output data, which allows the
user to verify at the pattern level, rather than the data instance level,
without having to write any regular expressions, thereby significantly reducing
user verification effort. Thereafter, CLX automatically generates
transformation programs as regular-expression replace operations that are easy
for average users to verify. We experimentally compared the CLX prototype with
both FlashFill, a state-of-the-art PBE data transformation tool, and Trifacta,
an influential system supporting interactive data transformation. The results
show improvements over the state of the art tools in saving user verification
effort, without loss of efficiency or expressive power. In a user effort study
on data sets of various sizes, when the data size grew by a factor of 30, the
user verification time required by the CLX prototype grew by 1.3x whereas that
required by FlashFill grew by 11.4x. In another test assessing the users'
understanding of the transformation logic - a key ingredient in effective
verification - CLX users achieved a success rate about twice that of FlashFill
users.

variety of applications including chemometrics, hyperspectral imaging, high

multiway data analysis approaches reformatted such tensor data as large vectors

classical two-way analysis such as PCA. However, one cannot discover hidden

decomposition methods which are flexible in the choice of the constraints and

solve three important challenges typically addressed by PCA: dimensionality
reduction, i.e. low-rank tensor approximation, supervised learning, i.e.
learning linear subspaces for feature extraction, and robust low-rank tensor
recovery. We also provide experimental results to compare different tensor

category C are understood to represent physical systems and morphisms, physical
processes. Elements of the monoid C(I,I) are interpreted somewhat
metaphorically as probabilities. Any monoid homomorphism from the scalars of a
symmetric monoidal category C gives rise to a covariant functor V_o from C to a
category of dual-pairs of ordered vector spaces. Specifying a natural
transformation u from V_o to 1 (where 1 is the trivial such functor) allows us
to identify normalized states, and, thus, to regard the image category V_o(C)
as consisting of concrete operational models. In this case, if A and B are
objects in C, then V_o(A x B) defines a non-signaling composite of V_o(A) and
V_o(B). Provided either that C satisfies a ""local tomography"" condition, or
that C is compact closed, this defines a symmetric monoidal structure on the
image category, and makes V_o a (strict) monoidal functor.

D-component was used to derive the rotation curve of the LMC disk, which is
consistent with the stellar rotation curve (Alves et al. 2000). Toward the
active cluster forming region of LHA 120-N 44, the three velocity components of
HI gas show signatures of dynamical interaction including bridges and
complementary spatial distributions. We hypothesize that the L- and

interaction triggered formation of the O and early B stars ionizing N44. In the

projection-averaging to obtain a robust test for the multivariate two-sample
problem. The proposed test is consistent against all fixed alternatives, robust
to heavy-tailed data and minimax rate optimal against a certain class of
alternatives. Our test statistic is completely free of tuning parameters and is
computationally efficient even in high dimensions. When the dimension tends to
infinity, the proposed test is shown to have comparable power to the existing
high-dimensional mean tests under certain location models. As a by-product of
our approach, we introduce a new metric called the angular distance which can
be thought of as a robust alternative to the Euclidean distance. Using the
angular distance, we connect the proposed method to the reproducing kernel
Hilbert space approach. In addition to the Cram\'er-von Mises statistic, we
demonstrate that the projection-averaging technique can be used to define
robust, multivariate tests in many other problems.

variable sample-size accelerated proximal scheme (VS-APM) and apply it on
$f_{\eta}(x)$, the ($\eta$-)Moreau smoothed variant of
$\mathbb{E}[f(x,\omega)]$; we term such a scheme as (m-VS-APM). We consider
three settings. (a) Bounded domains. In this setting, VS-APM displays linear
convergence in inexact gradient steps, each of which requires utilizing an
inner (SSG) scheme. Specifically, mVS-APM achieves an optimal oracle complexity
in SSG steps; (b) Unbounded domains. In this regime, under a weaker assumption
of suitable state-dependent bounds on subgradients, an unaccelerated variant
mVS-PM is linearly convergent; (c) Smooth ill-conditioned $f$. When $f$ is
$L$-smooth and $\kappa = L/\mu \ggg 1$, we employ mVS-APM where increasingly
accurate gradients $\nabla_x f_{\eta}(x)$ are obtained by VS-APM. Notably,
mVS-APM displays linear convergence and near-optimal complexity in inner
proximal evaluations (upto a log factor) compared to VS-APM. But, unlike a
direct application of VS-APM, this scheme is characterized by larger
steplengths and better empirical behavior; (II) Convex. When $f(x,\omega)$ is
merely convex but smoothable, by suitable choices of the smoothing, steplength,
and batch-size sequences, smoothed VS-APM (or sVS-APM) produces sequences for
which expected sub-optimality diminishes at the rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ with
an optimal oracle complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$. Finally, sVS-APM
and VS-APM produce sequences that converge almost surely to a solution of the
original problem.

halo/galaxy velocity bias $b_v=1$ at large scale. The resolution of this
important issue must resort to high precision cosmological simulations.
However, this is hampered by another long-standing `sampling artifact' problem
in volume weighted velocity measurement. We circumvent this problem with a
hybrid approach. We first measure statistics free of sampling artifact, then
link them to volume weighted statistics in theory, finally solve for the
velocity bias. $b_v$ determined by our method is not only free of sampling
artifact, but also free of cosmic variance. We apply this method to a
$\Lambda$CDM N-body simulation of $3072^3$ particles and $1200 Mpc/{\rm h}$ box
size. For the first time, we determine the halo velocity bias to $0.1\%$-$1\%$
accuracy. Our major findings are as follows: (1) $b_v\neq 1$ at $k>0.1 h/{\rm
Mpc}$. The deviation from unity ($|b_v-1|$) increases with $k$. Depending on
halo mass and redshift, it may reach $\mathcal{O}(0.01)$ at $k=0.2 h/{\rm Mpc}$
and $\mathcal{O}(0.05)$ at $k\sim 0.3 h/{\rm Mpc}$. The discovered $b_v\neq 1$
has statistically significant impact on structure growth rate measurement by
spectroscopic redshift surveys, including DESI, Euclid and SKA. (2) Both the
sign and the amplitude of $b_v-1$ depend on mass and redshift. These results
disagree with the peak model prediction in that $b_v$ has much weaker deviation
from unity, varies with redshift, and can be bigger than unity. (3) Most of the
mass and redshift dependences can be compressed into a single dependence on the
halo density bias. Based on this finding, we provide an approximate
two-parameter fitting formula.

a molecular formula of La0.2Sr0.7Fe12O19, which was confirmed by XRD to have
the same structure as SrFe12O19 with a lattice contraction of 0.59%.
Surprisingly, the doping effect turns La0.2Sr0.7Fe12O19 from ferroelectric to
antiferroelectric phase, which displays double hysteresis loops with a maximum
polarization of 154 uC/cm2 and a remnant one of 38uC/cm2. The dielectric
constant is also greatly improved from 1462 to 1451778 at 10.2Hz by this
substitution. This compound simultaneously demonstrates strong ferromagnetism,
the remnant magnetic moment and coercive field are 52 emu/g and 5876 Oe,
respectively. In addition, La0.2Sr0.7Fe12O19 also exhibits strong
magnetodielectric (MD) response, in which a applying magnetic field B lifts the
whole e1-f spectra up and right shifts e2-f spectra to higher frequency side.
Both real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant varies with frequency
and B field and obey Debye relaxation model. The maximum MD increment in e1
reaches as high as 540830 upon a B field of 926mT. The capacitance of the
La0.2Sr0.7Fe12O19 ceramics could be much more enhanced by applying a magnetic
field B, which could induce an additional polarization P(H) upon the
conventional P(E) by the cycloid conical spin in the intermediate phases. These
results suggest that La0.2Sr0.7Fe12O19 exhibits a strong interplay between

deformations of AdS$_5$ sigma models. For the SU(2) WZW model, we show that the
earlier proposed matrix valued gauge theory on the fuzzy 2-sphere can be
bootstrapped via an L$_\infty$ algebra. We then apply this approach to the
construction of non-commutative Chern-Simons and Yang-Mills theories on flat
and curved backgrounds with non-constant NC-structure. More concretely, up to
the second order, we demonstrate how derivative and curvature corrections to
the equations of motion can be bootstrapped in an algebraic way from the
L$_\infty$ algebra. The appearance of a non-trivial A$_\infty$ algebra is
discussed, as well.

stratification models for disease. However, chronic diseases that progress
slowly over time are often heterogeneous in their clinical presentation.
Patients may progress through disease stages at varying rates. This leads to
pathophysiological misalignment over time, making it difficult to consistently
compare patients in a clinically meaningful way. Furthermore, patients present
clinically for the first time at different stages of disease. This eliminates
the possibility of simply aligning patients based on their initial
presentation. Finally, patient data may be sampled at different rates due to
differences in schedules or missed visits. To address these challenges, we
propose a robust measure of patient similarity based on subsequence alignment.
Compared to global alignment techniques that do not account for
pathophysiological misalignment, focusing on the most relevant subsequences
allows for an accurate measure of similarity between patients. We demonstrate
the utility of our approach in settings where longitudinal data, while useful,
are limited and lack a clear temporal alignment for comparison. Applied to the
task of stratifying patients for risk of progression to probable Alzheimer's
Disease, our approach outperforms models that use only snapshot data (AUROC of
0.839 vs. 0.812) and models that use global alignment techniques (AUROC of
0.822). Our results support the hypothesis that patients' trajectories are
useful for quantifying inter-patient similarities and that using subsequence
matching and can help account for heterogeneity and misalignment in
longitudinal data.

dynamics (MD) simulations are employed to simulate the deformation during

lines nucleated behind the shock front. The information on the dislocation
lines is ensemble averaged inside slabs of the simulation box and over
different realizations of the MD simulations, from which continuous dislocation
fields are extracted using the Discrete-to-Continuous method. The continuous
dislocation fields are correlated with the stress and strain fields obtained
from the MD simulations. Based on this analysis, we show that the elastic
precursor overshoots the shear stress, after which dislocations on a specific
group of slip planes are nucleated, slightly lagging behind the elastic front.
Consequently, the resolved shear stress is relaxed, but the principal lateral
stress increases. The latter leads to an increase in the resolved shear stress
on a plane parallel to the shock wave, resulting in an additional retarded
front of dislocation nucleation on planes parallel to the shock front. Finally,
the two-stage process of plasticity results in an isotropic stress state in the
plane parallel to the shock wave. The MD simulation results are employed to
calculate the dislocation densities on specific slip planes and the plastic
deformation behind the shock, bridging the gap between the information on the

allows us to propose a principle of nonlocality for fractional derivatives. We
state that if the differential equation with fractional derivative can be
presented as a differential equation with a finite number of integer-order

derivative of non-integer order. This means that all results obtained for this
type of fractional derivatives can be derived by using differential operators

several~$\mu$s after de-excitation emission, scintillation photons are
separated to the fast and slow components. The fast component does not show

integrating the relationship (link) graphs among users/items into matrix

to impose smoothness priors for MC. Recently, geometric deep learning on graphs
(GDLG) is proposed to solve the GMC problem, showing better performance than
existing GMC methods including traditional graph regularization based methods.
To the best of our knowledge, there exists only one GDLG method for GMC, which
is called RMGCNN. RMGCNN combines graph convolutional network (GCN) and
recurrent neural network (RNN) together for GMC. In the original work of
RMGCNN, RMGCNN demonstrates better performance than pure GCN-based method. In
this paper, we propose a new GMC method, called convolutional geometric matrix

pure GCN-based method with a newly designed graph convolutional network.
Experimental results on real datasets show that CGMC can outperform other

foregrounds and complicated instrumental calibration. A reasonable approach for
mitigating these problems is the cross correlation with other observables. In
this work, we present the first results of the cross power spectrum (CPS)

systematics due to the ionospheric activity, the dependence of CPS on group of
pointings, and frequency. The resulting CPS is consistent with zero because the
error is dominated by the foregrounds in the 21cm observation. Additionally,
the variance of the signal indicates the presence of unexpected systematics
error at small scales. Furthermore, we reduce the error by one order of
magnitude with application of a foreground removal using a polynomial fitting
method. Based on the results, we find that the detection of the 21cm-CMB CPS

suppressed due to the gauged PQ symmetry. In this paper, we apply the gauged PQ
mechanism to models where the global PQ symmetry and supersymmetry (SUSY) are
simultaneously broken at around $\mathcal{O}(10^{11-12})$\,GeV. Such scenario
is motivated by an intriguing coincidence between the supersymmetry breaking
scale which explains the observed Higgs boson mass by the gravity mediated
sfermion masses, and the PQ breaking scale which evades all the astrophysical
and the cosmological constraints. As a concrete example, we construct a model
which consists of a simultaneous supersymmetry/PQ symmetry breaking sector
based on $SU(2)$ dynamics and an additional PQ symmetry breaking sector based
on $SU(N)$ dynamics. We also show that new vector-like particles are predicted
in the TeV range in the minimum model, which can be tested by the LHC

discrepancies between quantum Darwinism, and the nature of information and

black hole horizon to increase but the ergosphere to decrease, while the
magnitude is small; (iii) Dark matter does not change the singularity of black

the Solar System broadly follows the combined mass-ratio function inferred from
Kepler and microlensing. However, the exoplanet population has a less extreme

demographic events, swap events, i.e. moves between subgroups, occur in the
population. Event intensities are random functionals of the multi-type
population. In the first part, we show that the complexity of the problem is
significantly reduced by modeling the jumps measure of the population,
described by a multivariate counting process. This process is defined as a
solution of a stochastic differential system with random coefficients, driven
by a multivariate Poisson random measure. The solution is obtained under weak
assumptions, by the thinning of a strongly dominating point process generated

comparison result, of independent interest. The second part is dedicated to
averaging results when swap events are significantly more frequent than
demographic events. An important ingredient is the stable convergence, which is
well-adapted to the general random environment. The pathwise construction by
domination yields tightness results straightforwardly. At the limit, the
demographic intensity functionals are averaged against random kernels depending

  explained by attractor network dynamics",,,,,"physics.bio-ph cond-mat.dis-nn q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Perceptual decision making is the subject of many experimental and
theoretical studies. Whereas most modeling analysis are based on statistical
processes of accumulation of evidence, less attention is being devoted to the
modeling with attractor network dynamics, even though they describe well
psychophysical and neurophysiological data. In particular, very few works
confront attractor models predictions with data from continuous sequences of
trials. Recently however, a biophysical competitive attractor network model has
been used to describe such sequences of decision trials, and has been shown to
reproduce repetition biases observed in perceptual decision experiments. Here
we propose an extension of the reduced attractor network model of Wong and Wang
(2006) to get more insights into such effects. We make explicit the conditions
under which such network can perform a succession of decisions, and show that
the model provides a mathematical framework for studying the effects of a trial
on the decision made on the next one. We study in details the reaction times
properties during a sequence of decision trials, and show that the model
reproduces behavioral data, both qualitatively and quantitatively. In
particular, we find that the decision made on the current trial is biased
toward the one made on the previous trial. More remarkably, we show that, in
the absence of any feedback about the correctness of the decision, the network
exhibits post-error slowing, a subtle effect in agreement with empirical data.

understanding the time complexity of problems on compressed inputs, rather than
in convenient uncompressed forms, becomes more and more relevant. Suppose we
are given a compression of size $n$ of data that originally has size $N$, and
we want to solve a problem with time complexity $T(\cdot)$. The naive strategy
of ""decompress-and-solve"" gives time $T(N)$, whereas ""the gold standard"" is
time $T(n)$: to analyze the compression as efficiently as if the original data
was small.
  We restrict our attention to data in the form of a string (text, files,
genomes, etc.) and study the most ubiquitous tasks. While the challenge might
seem to depend heavily on the specific compression scheme, most methods of
practical relevance (Lempel-Ziv-family, dictionary methods, and others) can be
unified under the elegant notion of Grammar Compressions. A vast literature,
across many disciplines, established this as an influential notion for
Algorithm design.
  We introduce a framework for proving (conditional) lower bounds in this
field, allowing us to assess whether decompress-and-solve can be improved, and
by how much. Our main results are:
  - The $O(nN\sqrt{\log{N/n}})$ bound for LCS and the $O(\min\{N \log N, nM\})$
bound for Pattern Matching with Wildcards are optimal up to $N^{o(1)}$ factors,
under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis. (Here, $M$ denotes the
uncompressed length of the compressed pattern.)
  - Decompress-and-solve is essentially optimal for Context-Free Grammar
Parsing and RNA Folding, under the $k$-Clique conjecture.
  - We give an algorithm showing that decompress-and-solve is not optimal for
Disjointness.

oscillations in which those with high frequencies interfere destructively and
decay faster than those with a low frequency, which are the only to survive in
the output signal. Hence, coherence emerges from long-lived oscillations in an
inhomogeneous ensemble. We analyze the Fourier spectrum of the time-dependent

the influence of environmental humidity on soap film stability. An original
experiment allows to measure both the maximum length of a film pulled at
constant velocity and its thinning dynamics in a controlled atmosphere for
various values of the relative humidity $\RH$. At first order, the
environmental humidity seems to have almost no impact on most of the film
thinning dynamics. However, we find that the film length at rupture increases
continuously with $\RH$. To rationalize our observations, we propose that the
film bursting occurs when the thinning due to evaporation becomes comparable to
the thinning due to liquid drainage. This rupture criterion turns out to be in
reasonable agreement with an estimation of the evaporation rate in our

are well suited to model human languages and are thus popular in computational
linguistics. In the tree-adjoining grammar recognition problem, given a grammar
$\Gamma$ and a string $s$ of length $n$, the task is to decide whether $s$ can
be obtained from $\Gamma$. Rajasekaran and Yooseph's parser (JCSS'98) solves
this problem in time $O(n^{2\omega})$, where $\omega < 2.373$ is the matrix
multiplication exponent. The best algorithms avoiding fast matrix
multiplication take time $O(n^6)$.
  The first evidence for hardness was given by Satta (J. Comp. Linguist.'94):
For a more general parsing problem, any algorithm that avoids fast matrix
multiplication and is significantly faster than $O(|\Gamma| n^6)$ in the case
of $|\Gamma| = \Theta(n^{12})$ would imply a breakthrough for Boolean matrix
multiplication.
  Following an approach by Abboud et al. (FOCS'15) for context-free grammar
recognition, in this paper we resolve many of the disadvantages of the previous
lower bound. We show that, even on constant-size grammars, any improvement on
Rajasekaran and Yooseph's parser would imply a breakthrough for the $k$-Clique
problem. This establishes tree-adjoining grammar parsing as a practically
relevant problem with the unusual running time of $n^{2\omega}$, up to lower
order factors.

  Illumination-Varying Image Sequences","To appear in Pacific Graphics 2018",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Machine learning based Single Image Intrinsic Decomposition (SIID) methods
decompose a captured scene into its albedo and shading images by using the
knowledge of a large set of known and realistic ground truth decompositions.
Collecting and annotating such a dataset is an approach that cannot scale to
sufficient variety and realism. We free ourselves from this limitation by
training on unannotated images.
  Our method leverages the observation that two images of the same scene but
with different lighting provide useful information on their intrinsic
properties: by definition, albedo is invariant to lighting conditions, and
cross-combining the estimated albedo of a first image with the estimated
shading of a second one should lead back to the second one's input image. We
transcribe this relationship into a siamese training scheme for a deep
convolutional neural network that decomposes a single image into albedo and
shading. The siamese setting allows us to introduce a new loss function
including such cross-combinations, and to train solely on (time-lapse) images,
discarding the need for any ground truth annotations.
  As a result, our method has the good properties of i) taking advantage of the
time-varying information of image sequences in the (pre-computed) training
step, ii) not requiring ground truth data to train on, and iii) being able to
decompose single images of unseen scenes at runtime. To demonstrate and
evaluate our work, we additionally propose a new rendered dataset containing
illumination-varying scenes and a set of quantitative metrics to evaluate SIID
algorithms. Despite its unsupervised nature, our results compete with state of

avalanches. We report experimental evidence that the mechanical response of
knitted fabric displays such broadly distributed events both in the force
signal and in the deformation field, with statistics analogous to that of
earthquakes or soft amorphous materials. A knit consists of a regular network
of frictional contacts, linked by the elasticity of the yarn. When deformed,
the fabric displays spatially extended avalanche-like yielding events resulting
from collective inter-yarn contact slips. We measure the size distribution of
these avalanches, at the stitch level from the analysis of non-elastic
displacement fields, and externally from force fluctuations. The two
measurements yield consistent power law distributions reminiscent of those
found in other avalanching systems. Our study shows that a knitted fabric is
not only a thread-based metamaterial with highly sought after mechanical
properties, but also an original, model system, with topologically protected
structural order, where intermittent, scale-invariant response emerges from
minimal ingredients, and thus a significant landmark in the study of

mimic real-world networks. We pose the problem of graph generation as learning
the distribution of biased random walks over the input graph. The proposed
model is based on a stochastic neural network that generates discrete output
samples and is trained using the Wasserstein GAN objective. NetGAN is able to
produce graphs that exhibit well-known network patterns without explicitly
specifying them in the model definition. At the same time, our model exhibits
strong generalization properties, as highlighted by its competitive link
prediction performance, despite not being trained specifically for this task.
Being the first approach to combine both of these desirable properties, NetGAN
opens exciting avenues for further research.

strong transverse speeds, multi-stranded structure and heating from
chromospheric to transition region temperatures. In this work we first analyse
\textit{Hinode} \& \textit{IRIS} observations of spicules and find different
behaviours in terms of their Doppler velocity evolution and collective motion
of their sub-structure. Some have a Doppler shift sign change that is rather
fixed along the spicule axis, and lack coherence in the oscillatory motion of
strand-like structure, matching rotation models or long wavelength torsional
Alfv\'en waves. Others exhibit a Doppler shift sign change at maximum
displacement and coherent motion of their strands, suggesting a collective MHD
wave. By comparing with an idealised 3-D MHD simulation combined with radiative
transfer modelling, we analyse the role of transverse MHD waves and associated
instabilities in spicule-like features. We find that Transverse Wave Induced
Kelvin-Helmholtz (TWIKH) rolls lead to coherence of strand-like structure in
imaging and spectral maps, as seen in some observations. The rapid transverse
dynamics and the density and temperature gradients at the spicule boundary lead
to ring-shaped \ion{Mg}{2} k and \ion{Ca}{2} H source functions in the
transverse cross-section, potentially allowing IRIS to capture the KHI
dynamics. Twists and currents propagate along the spicule at Alfv\'enic speeds,
and the temperature variations within TWIKH rolls produce sudden appearance /
disappearance of strands seen in Doppler velocity and in \ion{Ca}{2} H
intensity. However, only a mild intensity increase in higher temperature lines
is obtained, suggesting there is an additional heating mechanism at work in
spicules.

tournaments in which the probability of one player beating another in a single

single-elimination, seeded format can be ""unfair"" in the sense that situations
can arise where an indisputibly better (and thus higher seeded) player may have
a smaller probability of winning the tournament than a worse one. This in turn
implies that, if the players are able to influence their seeding in some
preliminary competition, situations can arise where it is in a player's
interest to behave ""dishonestly"", by deliberately trying to lose a match. This
motivated us to ask whether it is possible for a tournament to be both honest,
meaning that it is impossible for a situation to arise where a rational player
throws a match, and ""symmetric"" - meaning basically that the rules treat
everyone the same - yet unfair, in the sense that an objectively better player
has a smaller probability of winning than a worse one. After rigorously

construct explicit examples for any number n >= 3 of players. For n=3, we show

provide an accurate description of nuclear dynamics and to account for
relativistic effects in the interaction vertex. Our calculations use a
saturating chiral Hamiltonian in order reproduce the correct nuclear sizes.
When final state interactions for the struck particle are accounted for, we
find nice agreement between the data and the theory for the inclusive
electron-$^{16}$O cross section. The results lay the foundations for future
applications of the Self Consistent Green's Function method, in both closed and
open shell nuclei, to neutrino data analysis.
  This work also presents results for the point-proton, charge and
single-nucleon momentum distribution of the same two nuclei. The center of mass
can affect these quantities for light nuclei and cannot be separated cleanly in
most ab initio post-Hartree-Fock methods. In order to address this, we
developed a Metropolis Monte Carlo calculation in which the center of mass
coordinate can be subtracted exactly from the trial wave function and the
expectation values. We gauged this effect for $^4$He by removing the center of
mass effect from the Optimal Reference State wave function that is generated
during the Self Consistent Green's Function calculations. Our findings clearly
indicate that the residual center of mass contribution strongly modifies
calculated matter distributions with respect to those obtained in the intrinsic

those sources may not completely share their categories, which further brings a
new transfer challenge called category shift. In this paper, we propose a deep
cocktail network (DCTN) to battle the domain and category shifts among multiple
sources. Motivated by the theoretical results in \cite{mansour2009domain}, the
target distribution can be represented as the weighted combination of source
distributions, and, the multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation via DCTN is
then performed as two alternating steps: i) It deploys multi-way adversarial
learning to minimize the discrepancy between the target and each of the
multiple source domains, which also obtains the source-specific perplexity
scores to denote the possibilities that a target sample belongs to different
source domains. ii) The multi-source category classifiers are integrated with
the perplexity scores to classify target sample, and the pseudo-labeled target
samples together with source samples are utilized to update the multi-source
category classifier and the feature extractor. We evaluate DCTN in three domain

mechanics, thus providing a quantum-theoretical formalism for extracting new
information from a system in the limit of small disturbance to its state. Here
we provide an application to the case of two-body scattering with one body
weakly interacting with its environment --- e.g. a neutron being scattered from
a H2 molecule physisorbed in a carbon nanotube.
  In particular, we make contact with the field of incoherent inelastic neutron
scattering from condensed systems. We provide a physically compelling
prediction of a new quantum effect --- a momentum transfer deficit; or
equivalently, an enhanced energy transfer; or an apparent reduction of the mass
of the struck particle. E.g., when a neutron collides with a H2 molecule in a
C-nanotube and excites its translational motion along the nanotube, it
apparently exchanges energy and momentum with a fictitious particle with mass
of 0.64 atomic mass units. Experimental results are shown and discussed in the
new theoretical frame. The effect under consideration has no conventional
interpretation, thus also supporting the novelty of the quantum theoretical
framework of WV and TVSF. Some speculative remarks about possible applications
being of technological interest (fuel cells and hydrogen storage; Li+
batteries; information and communication technology) are shortly mentioned.

learning. However, many contemporary face recognition models still perform
relatively poor in processing profile faces compared to frontal faces. A key
reason is that the number of frontal and profile training faces are highly
imbalanced - there are extensively more frontal training samples compared to
profile ones. In addition, it is intrinsically hard to learn a deep
representation that is geometrically invariant to large pose variations. In
this study, we hypothesize that there is an inherent mapping between frontal
and profile faces, and consequently, their discrepancy in the deep
representation space can be bridged by an equivariant mapping. To exploit this
mapping, we formulate a novel Deep Residual EquivAriant Mapping (DREAM) block,
which is capable of adaptively adding residuals to the input deep
representation to transform a profile face representation to a canonical pose
that simplifies recognition. The DREAM block consistently enhances the
performance of profile face recognition for many strong deep networks,
including ResNet models, without deliberately augmenting training data of
profile faces. The block is easy to use, light-weight, and can be implemented
with a negligible computational overhead.

strategy to overcome the computational difficulties brought by large sample
size. In previous studies, researchers conducted random sampling which is
according to the input data but independent on the response variable, however
the response variable may also be informative for sampling. In this paper we
propose an adaptive sampling called the gradient-based sampling which is
dependent on both the input data and the output for fast solving of
least-square (LS) problems. We draw the data points by random sampling from the
full data according to their gradient values. This sampling is computationally
saving, since the running time of computing the sampling probabilities is
reduced to O(nd) where n is the full sample size and d is the dimension of the
input. Theoretically, we establish an error bound analysis of the general
importance sampling with respect to LS solution from full data. The result
establishes an improved performance of the use of our gradient- based sampling.
Synthetic and real data sets are used to empirically argue that the
gradient-based sampling has an obvious advantage over existing sampling methods
from two aspects of statistical efficiency and computational saving.

graph. Since the quantitative study of such increasingly labeled graphs
(directly related to processes) seems out of reach, we restrict ourselves to
the study of arch processes, a simplistic model of processes with futures. They
are based on two parameters related to their sizes and their numbers of arches.
The increasingly labeled structures seems not to be specifiable in the sense of
Analytic Combinatorics, but we manage to derive a recurrence equation for the
enumeration. For this model we first exhibit an exact and an asymptotic formula
for the number of runs of a given process. The second main contribution is

non-rotating stratified turbulence, with the quasi-biennial oscillation in the
equatorial stratosphere and the ocean's equatorial deep jets being two
examples. Explaining the formation of jets in stratified turbulence is a
fundamental problem in geophysical fluid dynamics. Statistical state dynamics
(SSD) provides powerful methods for analyzing turbulent systems exhibiting
emergent organization, such as banded jets. In SSD, dynamical equations are
written directly for the evolution of the turbulence statistics, enabling
direct analysis of the statistical interactions between the incoherent
component of the turbulence and the coherent large-scale structure component
that underlie jet formation. A second-order closure of SSD, known as S3T, has
previously been applied to show that meridionally banded jets emerge in
barotropic beta-plane turbulence via a statistical instability referred to as
the zonostrophic instability. Two-dimensional Boussinesq turbulence provides a
simple model of non-rotating stratified turbulence analogous to the beta-plane
model of planetary turbulence. Jets known as vertically sheared horizontal
flows (VSHFs) often emerge in simulations of Boussinesq turbulence, but their
dynamics is not yet clearly understood. In this work S3T analysis of the
zonostrophic instability is extended to study VSHF emergence in two-dimensional
Boussinesq turbulence using an analytical formulation of S3T amenable to
perturbation stability analysis. VSHFs are shown to form via an instability
that is analogous in stratified turbulence to the zonostrophic instability in
beta-plane turbulence. This instability is shown to be strikingly similar to
the zonostrophic instability, suggesting that jet emergence in both geostrophic
and non-rotating stratified turbulence may be understood as instances of the
same generic phenomenon.

of yellowish-colored CsPbBr3 structure under daylight, UV illumination reveals
that the degradation of crystals takes place in two steps; transition from
blue-emitting to green-emitting structure and and then transition from
green-emitting phase to complete degradation. We found that as-synthesized
CsPbBr3 NWs emit blue light under 254 nm UV source and before the degradation,
first CsPbBr3 NWs undergoes a water-driven structural transition to form large
bundles. It is also seen that formation of such bundles provide longer-term
environmental stability. In addition theoretical calculations revealed how
strong is the interaction of water molecules with ligands and surfaces of
CsPbBr3 and provide atomistic-level explanation to transition from
ligand-covered nanowires to bundle formation. Further interaction of
green-light-emitting bundles with water causes complete degradation of CsPbBr3
and photoluminescence signal is entirely quenched. Moreover, Raman and XRD
measurements revealed that completely degraded regions are decomposed to PbBr2

the hypervolume subset selection problem. It is known that the problem can be
solved in polynomial time in the plane, while the best known running time in
any dimension $d \ge 3$ is $\Omega\big(\binom{n}{k}\big)$. We show that:
  - The problem is NP-hard already in 3 dimensions.
  - In 3 dimensions, we break the bound $\Omega\big(\binom{n}{k}\big)$, by
providing an $n^{O(\sqrt{k})}$ algorithm.
  - For any constant dimension $d$, we present an efficient polynomial-time
approximation scheme.

parameter spaces. When applied as a sparse regularizer for line spectral

problem. This problem is known as atomic norm soft thresholding (AST). It can
be cast as a semidefinite program and solved by standard methods. In the
semidefinite formulation there are $O(N^2)$ dual variables which complicates
the implementation of a standard primal-dual interior-point method based on
symmetric cones. That has lead researcher to consider alternating direction
method of multipliers (ADMM) for the solution of AST, but this method is still
somewhat slow for large problem sizes. To obtain a faster algorithm we
reformulate AST as a non-symmetric conic program. That has two properties of
key importance to its numerical solution: the conic formulation has only $O(N)$
dual variables and the Toeplitz structure inherent to AST is preserved. Based
on it we derive FastAST which is a primal-dual interior point method for
solving AST. Two variants are considered with the fastest one requiring only
$O(N^2)$ flops per iteration. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that
FastAST solves AST significantly faster than a state-of-the-art solver based on
ADMM.

characterization, cathodoluminescence and EL of a new 2D HOIS, (4-fluoro
phenethylamine-H)2PbBr4, and its defect variations (DVs). The latter, in
contrast to the pristine material, allow for the first time the simple
fabrication of a prototype blue EL device by coating DVs on a conducting anode
substrate and using a Ga/In droplet cathode. DVs' optimization can lead to
improved light emitting devices (LEDs) and the work here is expected to provide
the incentive for utilizing HOIS DVs, as these are compatible with industrial
scale synthesis. In contrast to the pristine iodine analogue, whose thin films
readily provide EL, only the DVs or mixtures with MoS2 nano-sized platelets
provide EL, after careful deposition. These exhibit defects that disrupt the
planar non-conductive nature of the micrometric 2D HOIS platelets, usually
aligned parallel to the substrate, thus, providing mechanisms for current flow.
Finally, the choice of the fluorine-modified amine enhances the functionality
of the DVs as LED materials compared to using unmodified amine due to the
repulsion among the amine tails, leading to stable decorated 2D inorganic
sheets that are weakly bound.

drastically decreased the frequency of inhibitory (from 1.81 Hz to 0.86 Hz) and
excitatory (from 1.61 Hz to 0.68 Hz) miniature postsynaptic currents, and
consistently reduced action potential (AP) firing frequency (by 36%), as
measured by microelectrode arrays. On the contrary, bursts synchronization was
preserved, as well as the amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory and excitatory
events. Current-clamp recordings revealed that the ratio of neurons responding
with AP trains of high-frequency (fast-spiking) versus neurons responding with
trains of low-frequency (slow-spiking) was unaltered, suggesting that FNDs
exerted a comparable action on neuronal subpopulations. At the single cell
level, rapid onset of the somatic AP (""kink"") was drastically reduced in
FND-treated neurons, suggesting a reduced contribution of axonal and dendritic
components while preserving neuronal excitability.

proposed sparse Dirichlet prior for abundance vector that made it possible to
use this algorithm in semi-supervised scenario where the exact involved

level atoms, each coupled to a reservoir. We prove that the mean field quantum
master equation has a unique regular stationary solution. In case a relevant
parameter $C_\mathfrak{b} $, i.e., the cavity cooperative parameter, is less
than $1$, we prove that any regular solution converges exponentially fast to
the equilibrium, and so the regular stationary state is a globally
asymptotically stable equilibrium solution. We obtain that a locally
exponential stable limit cycle is born at the regular stationary state as
$C_\mathfrak{b} $ passes through the critical value $1$. Then, the mean-field
laser equation has a Poincar\'e-Andronov-Hopf bifurcation at $C_\mathfrak{b} =1

density matrices --for the first time--, the transition from a global attractor
quantum state, where the light is not emitted, to a locally stable set of
coherent quantum states producing coherent light. Moreover, we establish the
local exponential stability of the limit cycle in case a relevant parameter is
between the first and second laser thresholds appearing in the semiclassical
laser theory. Thus, we get that the coherent laser light persists over time
under this condition. In order to prove the exponential convergence of the
quantum state, we develop a new technique for proving the exponential
convergence in open quantum systems that is based in a new variation of

emerging research in Information-Centric Networks (ICN) to route edge-to-edge

to establish path-based flows over a fast forwarding substrate; thereby,
eliminating the need for IP routing between service points within a single

the CDN and network resources through Monte Carlo simulations that explore a

Depending on the direction of the forcing, the height of the two barriers, one
for each path, will either oscillate alternating or in synchronisation. We
consider a simplified model given by a continuous time Markov Chains with two
states. This was done for alternating and synchronised wells. The invariant
measures are derived for both cases and shown to be constant for the
synchronised case. A PDF for the escape time from an oscillatory potential is
studied. Methods of detecting stochastic resonance are presented, which are
linear response, signal-noise ratio, energy, out-of-phase measures, relative
entropy and entropy. A new statistical test called the conditional
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is developed, which can be used to analyse stochastic
resonance. An explicit two dimensional potential is introduced, the critical
point structure derived and the dynamics, the invariant state and escape time
studied numerically. The six measures are unable to detect the stochastic
resonance in the case of synchronised saddles. The distribution of escape times
however not only shows a clear sign of stochastic resonance, but changing the

space technology. Well established cryptographic technology is already in place
and is expected to continue to be so. On the other hand, information
theoretical security emerges as a post-quantum versatile candidate to
complement overall security strength. In order to prove such potential,
performance analysis methods are needed that consider realistic legitimate and
eavesdropper system assumptions and non-asymptotic coding lengths. In this
paper we propose the design of secure radio frequency (RF) satellite links with
realistic system assumptions. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we propose
a wiretap channel model for the finite-length regime. The model includes an
stochastic wiretap encoding method using existing practical linear error
correcting codes and hash codes. Secrecy is provided with privacy
amplification, for which the finite-length secrecy metric is given that upper
bounds semantic secrecy. Second, we derive a novel RF (broadcast) satellite
wiretap channel model that parameterizes the stochastic degraded channel around
the legitimate channel, a necessary condition to enable secure communication.
Finally, we show the design of a secure satellite physical layer and
finite-length performance evaluation. In doing so, we define as sacrifice rate
the fixed fraction of the overall coding rate budget for reliability that needs
to be allocated to secrecy. Our methodology does not make use of channel side
information of the eavesdropper, only assumes worst case system assumptions. We
illustrate our proposed design method with numerical results using practical
error correcting codes in current standards of satellite communication.

specific structures observed in MAP estimates (e.g., lesions in medical

methods aimed at the automated discovery of dynamical systems, where first

abrupt changes must be rapidly characterized based on limited, incomplete, and
noisy data. Many leading automated learning techniques rely on unrealistically
large data sets and it is unclear how to leverage prior knowledge effectively

conceptual framework to recover parsimonious models of a system in response to
abrupt changes in the low-data limit. First, the abrupt change is detected by
comparing the estimated Lyapunov time of the data with the model prediction.
Next, we apply the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy)
regression to update a previously identified model with the fewest changes,
either by addition, deletion, or modification of existing model terms. We
demonstrate this sparse model recovery on several examples for abrupt system
change detection in periodic and chaotic dynamical systems. Our examples show
that sparse updates to a previously identified model perform better with less
data, have lower runtime complexity, and are less sensitive to noise than
identifying an entirely new model. The proposed abrupt-SINDy architecture
provides a new paradigm for the rapid and efficient recovery of a system model

suitable families of vector fields - that preserves their transverse geometry.
Associated to every singular foliation there is a holonomy groupoid, by the
work of Androulidakis-Skandalis. We show that our notion of equivalence is
compatible with this assignment, and as a consequence we obtain several
invariants. Further, we show that it unifies some of the notions of transverse
equivalence for regular foliations that appeared in the 1980's.

The outcome of this big data prediction proved to be entirely wrong, whereas

Generally, biases occur in machine learning whenever the distributions of
training set and test set are different. In this work, we provide a review of
different sorts of biases in (big) data sets in machine learning. We provide
definitions and discussions of the most commonly appearing biases in machine
learning: class imbalance and covariate shift. We also show how these biases
can be quantified and corrected. This work is an introductory text for both
researchers and practitioners to become more aware of this topic and thus to
derive more reliable models for their learning problems.

driving the need for extremely fast and fine-grained service provisioning in

efficient and flexible computation and networking fabrics, that can be rapidly
reconfigured to meet the computation and communication tasks at hand. In this
article, we propose a novel Fog Computing architecture that translates IoT
communications into service transactions, provisioned over a fast and efficient
networking fabric. Service matching is provided by a network function designed
using principles from Information-Centric Networks (ICN) research, routing edge
requests directly to the nearest service points without expensive and slow DNS
redirects. The proposed Fog substrate reduces the networking complexity and
overhead while being architecturally simple. We evaluate the architecture
through a comparison with how Fog might be established over existing networking
fabrics and quantify the performance benefits. Evaluation results illustrate
the superiority of the proposed architecture in reducing the required backhaul

of the signals recorded on its nodes. The analysis of how the activity in one
node predicts the behaviour of another gives the directionality in their
relationship. However, each node is composed of many different elements which
define the properties of the links. For instance, excitatory and inhibitory
neuronal subtypes determine the functionality of the connection. Classic
indexes such as the Granger causality (GC) quantifies these interactions, but
they do not infer into the mechanism behind them. Here, we introduce an
extension of the well-known GC that analyses the correlation associated to the
specific influence that a transmitter node has over the receiver. This way, the
G-causal link has a positive or negative effect if the predicted activity
follows directly or inversely, respectively, the dynamics of the sender. The
method is validated in a neuronal population model, testing the paradigm that
excitatory and inhibitory neurons have a differential effect in the
connectivity. Our approach correctly infers the positive or negative coupling
produced by different types of neurons. Our results suggest that the proposed
approach provides additional information on the characterization of G-causal

exponential convergence implies an exponential growth of the condition number

It is shown that each of the four normed division algebras over the reals

the quaternions, the represented circular braid groups are $B_2$ and $B_3^c$,
precisely those used to construct leptons and quarks as framed braids in the

  The identification of basis states of minimal ideals with certain framed

to zero trusters, with many untrustworthy individuals. The promotion of trust
is an uneasy task, despite the fact that a combination of trusters and
trustworthy trustees is the most rational and optimal social state. This paper
presents the game and results of replicator dynamics in a hope that researchers
in evolutionary games see opportunities in filling this critical gap in the

optics. Commonly, however, it is difficult to achieve a unidirectional profile
in such a system without breaking reciprocity. Recently, assisted by
metamaterials without structural symmetry, antennas that radiate asymmetrically
have been developed, hence providing the possibility of achieving
unidirectionality. Nevertheless, it has been challenging to achieve extremely
high radiation asymmetry in such antennas. Here, we demonstrate that this
radiation asymmetry is further enhanced when magnetic plasmons are present in
the metamaterials. Experimentally, we show that a thin metamaterial with a
thickness of approximately {\lambda}_0/8 can exhibit a forward-to-backward
emission asymmetry of up to 1:32 without any optimization. Our work paves the
way for manipulating asymmetric radiation by means of metamaterials and may
have a variety of promising applications, such as directional optical and
quantum emitters, lasers, and absorbers.

  electron-hole separation in condensed phases","5 pages, 3 figures, minor revision","Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 026001 (2018)","10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.026001",,"cond-mat.mes-hall physics.app-ph quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In organic photovoltaic systems, a photogenerated molecular exciton in the
donor domain dissociates into a hole and an electron at the donor/acceptor
heterojunction, and subsequently separate into free charge carriers that can be
extracted as photocurrents. The recombination of the once-separated electron
and hole is a major loss mechanism in photovoltaic systems, which controls
their performance. Hence, efficient photovoltaic systems need built-in ratchet
mechanisms, namely, ultrafast charge separation and retarded charge
recombination. In order to obtain insight into the internal working of the
experimentally observed ultrafast long-range charge separation and protection
against charge recombination, we theoretically investigate a potential ratchet
mechanism arising from the combination of quantum delocalization and its
destruction by performing numerically accurate quantum-dynamics calculations on
a model system. It is demonstrated that the non-Markovian effect originating
from the slow polaron formation strongly suppresses the electron transfer
reaction back to the interfacial charge-transfer state stabilized at the
donor/accepter interface and that it plays a critical role in maintaining the
long-range electron--hole separation.

  materials",,,,,"physics.class-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The free propagation of acoustic plane waves through cellular periodic
materials is generally accompanied by a flow of mechanical energy across the
adjacent cells. The paper focuses on the energy transport related to dispersive
waves propagating through nondissipative microstructured materials. The generic
microstructure of the periodic cell is described by a beam lattice model,
suitably reduced to the minimal space of dynamic degrees-of-freedom. The linear
eigenproblem governing the wave propagation is stated and the complete
eigensolution is considered to study both the real-valued dispersion functions
and the complex-valued waveforms of the propagating elastic waves. First, a
complete family of nondimensional quantities (polarization factors) is proposed
to quantify the linear polarization or quasi-polarization, according to a
proper energetic criterion. Second, a vector variable related to the periodic
cell is introduced to assess the directional flux of mechanical energy, in
analogy to the Umov-Poynting vector related to the material point in solid
mechanics. The physical-mathematical relation between the energy flux and the
velocity of the energy transport is recognized. The formal equivalence between
the energy and the group velocity is pointed out, according to the mechanical
assumptions. Finally, all the theoretical developments are successfully applied
to the prototypical beam lattice material characterized by a periodic
tetrachiral microstructure.

depends on the mass as it happens in Topologically Massive Gravity.

servicing costs under non-renewing and renewing free repair warranties. We
assume that the repair time for rectifying the claims is non-zero and the
repair cost is a function of the length of the repair time. To accommodate the
ageing of the product and repair equipment, we use a decreasing geometric
process to model the consecutive operational times and an increasing geometric
process to model the consecutive repair times. We identify and study the
alternating geometric process (AGP), which is an alternating process with
cycles consisting of the item's operational time followed by the corresponding
repair time. We derive new results for the AGP in finite horizon and use them
to evaluate the warranty costs over the warranty period and over the life cycle
of the product under a non-renewing free repair warranty (NRFRW), a renewing
free repair warranty (RFRW) and a restricted renewing free repair warranty
(RRFRW(n)). Properties of the model are demonstrated using a simulation study.
