of the spin-1/2 XXZ chain and generic two-site states. The result takes the
same form as in the previously known cases: it involves the same ratio of two
Gaudin-like determinants, and a product of single-particle overlap functions,
which can be fixed using a combination of the Quench Action and Quantum
Transfer Matrix methods. Our conjecture is confirmed by numerical data from
exact diagonalization. For one-site states the formula is found to be correct
even in chains with odd length, where existing methods can not be applied. It
is also pointed out, that the ratio of the Gaudin-like determinants plays a
crucial role in the overlap sum rule: it guarantees that in the thermodynamic
limit there remains no $\mathcal{O}(1)$ piece in the Quench Action.

correlations of Josephson phases in frustrated arrays of Josephson junctions.
Two types of one-dimensional arrays, namely, the diamond and sawtooth chains,
are discussed. For these arrays in the linear regime the Josephson phase
dynamics is characterized by multiband dispersion relation $\omega(k)$, and the
lowest band becomes completely $flat$ at a critical value of frustration,
$f=f_c$ . In a strongly nonlinear regime such critical value of frustration
determines the crossover from non-frustrated ($0<f<f_c$) to frustrated
($f_c<f<1$) regimes. The crossover is characterized by the thermodynamic
spatial correlation functions of phases on vertices, $\varphi_i$, i.e.
$C_p(i-j)=\langle\cos[p(\varphi_i - \varphi_j)]\rangle$ displaying the
transition from long- to short-range spatial correlations. We find that
higher-order correlations functions, e.g. $p=2$ and $p=3$, restore the
long-range behavior deeply in the frustrated regime, $f\simeq 1$. Monte-Carlo
simulations of the thermodynamics of frustrated arrays of Josephson junctions
are in good agreement with analytical results.

density of states (DOS) for a class of rank-structured matrices with
application to the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) of the Bethe-Salpeter
equation (BSE). The presented approach for approximating the DOS is based on
two main techniques. First, we propose an economical method for calculating the
traces of parametric matrix resolvents at interpolation points by taking
advantage of the block-diagonal plus low-rank matrix structure described in [6,
3] for the BSE/TDA problem. Second, we show that a regularized or smoothed DOS
discretized on a fine grid of size $N$ can be accurately represented by a low
rank quantized tensor train (QTT) tensor that can be determined through a least
squares fitting procedure. The latter provides good approximation properties
for strictly oscillating DOS functions with multiple gaps, and requires
asymptotically much fewer ($O(\log N)$) functional calls compared with the full
grid size $N$. This approach allows us to overcome the computational
difficulties of the traditional schemes by avoiding both the need of stochastic
sampling and interpolation by problem independent functions like polynomials
etc. Numerical tests indicate that the QTT approach yields accurate recovery of
DOS associated with problems that contain relatively large spectral gaps. The
QTT tensor rank only weakly depends on the size of a molecular system which
paves the way for treating large-scale spectral problems.

contributions are as follows. Firstly, we derive an upper bound for the

generalizes the quantum Singleton bound for standard quantum error correction

existing codes with the same coding length. Moreover, some of the constructed

observations, which are modeled as non-stationary graph signals generated by
local diffusion dynamics that depend on the structure of the unknown network.
Using the so-called graph-shift operator (GSO), which is a matrix
representation of the graph, we first identify the eigenvectors of the shift
matrix from realizations of the diffused signals, and then estimate the
eigenvalues by imposing desirable properties on the graph to be recovered.
Different from the stationary setting where the eigenvectors can be obtained
directly from the covariance matrix of the observations, here we need to
estimate first the unknown diffusion (graph) filter -- a polynomial in the GSO
that preserves the sought eigenbasis. To carry out this initial system
identification step, we exploit different sources of information on the
arbitrarily-correlated input signal driving the diffusion on the graph. We
first explore the simpler case where the observations, the input information,
and the unknown graph filter are linearly related. We then address the case
where the relation is given by a system of matrix quadratic equations, which
arises in pragmatic scenarios where only the second-order statistics of the
inputs are available. While such quadratic filter identification problem boils
down to a non-convex fourth-order polynomial minimization, we discuss
identifiability conditions, propose algorithms to approximate the solution and
analyze their performance. Numerical tests illustrate the effectiveness of the
proposed topology inference algorithms in recovering brain, social, financial
and urban transportation networks using synthetic and real-world signals.

their packets by broadcasting coded or uncoded packets over a lossless
broadcast channel, and monetary transactions are allowed between any pair of
users. We define the utility of each user as the sum of two sub-utility
functions: (i) the difference between the total payment received by the user
and the total transmission rate of the user, and (ii) the difference between
the total number of required packets by the user and the total payment made by
the user. A rate-vector and payment-matrix pair $(r,p)$ is said to stabilize
the grand coalition (i.e., the set of all users) if $(r,p)$ is Pareto optimal
over all minor coalitions (i.e., all proper subsets of users who collectively
know all packets in $X$). Our goal is to design a stabilizing rate-payment pair
with minimum total sum-rate and minimum total sum-payment for any given
instance of the problem. In this work, we propose two algorithms that find such
a solution. Moreover, we show that both algorithms maximize the sum of utility
of all users (over all solutions), and one of the algorithms also maximizes the
minimum utility among all users (over all solutions).

nucleus, influencing the evolution and lifetimes of comets (1,2). If these
torques spin up the rotation to the point that centripetal forces exceed the
material strength of the nucleus, the comet may fragment (3). Torques that slow
down the rotation can cause the spin state to become unstable, but if the
torques persist, the nucleus may eventually reorient itself and start to spin
up again (4). Simulations predict that most comets will go through a short
phase of changing spin states, after which changes occur gradually over long
times (5). We report on observations of comet 41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kres\'ak
during its highly favourable close approach to Earth (0.142 au on April 1,
2017) that reveal a dramatic spin-down. Between March and May 2017, the
nucleus' apparent rotation period increased from 20 hours to over 46 hours,
reflecting a rate of change more than an order of magnitude larger than has
ever been measured before. This phenomenon must be caused by a fortuitous
alignment of the comet's gas emission in such a way as to produce an
anomalously strong torque that is slowing the nucleus' spin rate. The behaviour
of 41P suggests that it is in a distinct evolutionary state and that its
rotation may be approaching the point of instability.

scales of organisation at which turbulent convection operates, and its
relationship with the magnetic flux therein, we studied characteristic spatial
and temporal scales of magnetic features in the quiet Sun. Methods. Thanks to
an unprecedented data set entirely enclosing a supergranule, occurrence and
persistence analysis of magnetogram time series were used to detect spatial and
long-lived temporal correlations in the quiet Sun and to investigate their
nature. Results. A relation between occurrence and persistence representative
for the quiet Sun was found. In particular, highly recurrent and persistent
patterns were detected especially in the boundary of the supergranular cell.
These are due to moving magnetic elements undergoing motion that behaves like a
random walk together with longer decorrelations ($\sim2$ h) with respect to
regions inside the supergranule. In the vertices of the supegranular cell the
maximum observed occurrence is not associated with the maximum persistence,
suggesting that there are different dynamic regimes affecting the magnetic

antichains) of a poset $P$, which when iterated on special posets, has
unexpectedly nice properties in terms of periodicity, cyclic sieving, and
homomesy (statistics whose averages over each orbit are constant) [AST11, BW74,

$\chi_d, \Delta^*$ and are asked if we can partition $V$ into $\chi_d$ color

investigate the complexity of this generalization of Coloring with respect to
several well-studied graph parameters, and show that the problem is W-hard
parameterized by treewidth, pathwidth, tree-depth, or feedback vertex set, if
$\chi_d = 2$. As expected, this hardness can be extended to larger values of
$\chi_d$ for most of these parameters, with one surprising exception: we show
that the problem is FPT parameterized by feedback vertex set for any $\chi_d
\ge 2$, and hence 2-coloring is the only hard case for this parameter. In
addition to the above, we give an ETH-based lower bound for treewidth and
pathwidth, showing that no algorithm can solve the problem in $n^{o(pw)}$,
essentially matching the complexity of an algorithm obtained with standard
techniques.
  We complement these results by considering the problem's approximability and
show that, with respect to $\Delta^*$, the problem admits an algorithm which
for any $\epsilon > 0$ runs in time $(tw/\epsilon)^{O(tw)}$ and returns a
solution with exactly the desired number of colors that approximates the
optimal $\Delta^*$ within $(1 + \epsilon)$. We also give a $(tw)^{O(tw)}$
algorithm which achieves the desired $\Delta^*$ exactly while 2-approximating
the minimum value of $\chi_d$. We show that this is close to optimal, by
establishing that no FPT algorithm can (under standard assumptions) achieve a
better than $3/2$-approximation to $\chi_d$, even when an extra constant
additive error is also allowed.

theoretical and empirical paradigms for the investigation of phenomenological

challenge in the field is to develop measures that uniquely quantify global
brain states tied to consciousness. In particular, information-theoretic
complexity measures such as integrated information have recently been proposed
as measures of conscious awareness. This suggests a new framework to
quantitatively classify states of consciousness. However, it has proven
increasingly difficult to apply these complexity measures to realistic brain
networks. In part, this is due to high computational costs incurred when
implementing these measures on realistically large network dimensions.
Nonetheless, complexity measures for quantifying states of consciousness are
important for assisting clinical diagnosis and therapy. This article is meant
to serve as a lookup table of measures of consciousness, with particular
emphasis on clinical applicability of these measures. We consider both,
principle-based complexity measures as well as empirical measures tested on
patients. We address challenges facing these measures with regard to realistic
brain networks, and where necessary, suggest possible resolutions.

driven by the action of ram pressure stripping (RPS), that can affect the cold
gas disc, and tidal stripping (TS), which can act on all baryonic components.
Galaxy orbits of orphan satellites are integrated providing adequate positions
and velocities for the estimation of RPS and TS. The star formation history and
stellar mass assembly of galaxies are sensitive to the redshift dependence
implemented in the SN feedback model. We discuss a variant of our model that
allows to reconcile the predicted star formation rate density at $z \gtrsim 3$

stellar mass function at $z=2$. The fractions of passive galaxies as a function
of stellar mass, halo mass and the halo-centric distances are consistent with
observational measurements. The model also reproduces the evolution of the main
sequence of star forming central and satellite galaxies. The similarity between
them is a result of the gradual starvation of the hot gas halo suffered by
satellites, in which RPS plays a dominant role. RPS of the cold gas does not
affect the fraction of quenched satellites but it contributes to reach the
right atomic hydrogen gas content for more massive satellites

of mass and environmental quenching on satellite galaxies. We find that
environmental processes dominate the star formation (SF) quenching of low-mass
satellites ($M_{\star} \lesssim 10^{10.5}\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$), whereas
high-mass galaxies typically quench as centrals. High-mass galaxies that remain
actively forming stars while being accreted are found to be mainly affected by
mass quenching after their first infall. For a given stellar mass, our model
predicts SF quenching to be less efficient in low-mass haloes both before and
after infall, in contradiction with common interpretations of observational
data. Our model supports a two-stage scenario to explain the SF quenching.
Initially, the SF of satellites resembles that of centrals until the gas
cooling rate is reduced to approximately half its value at infall. Then, the SF
fades through secular processes that exhaust the cold gas reservoir. This
reservoir is not replenished efficiently due to the action of either
ram-pressure stripping (RPS) of the hot gas in low-mass satellites, or feedback
from the active galactic nucleus (AGN) in high-mass satellites. The delay times
for the onset of SF quenching are found to range from $\approx 3\,{\rm Gyr}$ to
$\approx 1\,{\rm Gyr}$ for low-mass ($M_{\star} \approx 10^{10}\, {\rm
M}_{\odot}$) and high-mass ($M_{\star} \approx 10^{11}\, {\rm M}_{\odot}$)
satellites, respectively. SF fades in $\approx 1.5\,{\rm Gyr}$, largely
independent of stellar mass. We find that the SF quenching of low-mass
satellites supports the so-called delay-then-rapid quenching scenario. However,
the SF history of $z=0$ passive satellites of any stellar mass is better
described by a delay-then-fade quenching scenario.

One approach to mitigate such concerns is the use of $k$-limited-access schemes

and in particular, at most $k$ rows. These schemes transform a linear index
coding matrix of rank $T$ to an alternate one, such that each client needs to

novel construction of the coding matrix is provided and shown to be

considered line emission from key species in the gas cooling of PDRs (C+, O,

collected from Herschel observations, the literature and the Spitzer archive
and are analyzed using the Meudon PDR code. A grid of models was run to explore
the parameter space of only two parameters: thermal gas pressure and a global
scaling factor that corrects for approximations in the assumed geometry. We
conclude that the emission in the high-J CO lines, which were observed up to
Jup=23 in the Orion Bar (Jup=19 in NGC7023), can only originate from small
structures of typical thickness of a few 1e-3 pc and at high thermal pressures

thermal pressure increases with the intensity of the UV radiation field given
by G0, following a trend in line with recent simulations of the
photoevaporation of illuminated edges of molecular clouds. This relation can
help rationalising the analysis of high-J CO emission in massive star formation

demanded by all the clients in a broadcast channel. The encoding is performed
in such a way that each client can retrieve its demanded message from its side
information and the broadcast codeword. In general, in order to decode its
demanded message symbol, a receiver may have to observe the entire transmitted
codeword. Querying or downloading the codeword symbols might involve costs to a
client -- such as network utilization costs and storage requirements for the
queried symbols to perform decoding. In traditional index coding solutions,
this 'client aware' perspective is not considered during code design. As a
result, for these codes, the number of codeword symbols queried by a client per
decoded message symbol, which we refer to as 'locality', could be large. In
this paper, considering locality as a cost parameter, we view index coding as a
trade-off between the achievable broadcast rate (codeword length normalized by
the message length) and locality, where the objective is to minimize the
broadcast rate for a given value of locality and vice versa. We show that the
smallest possible locality for any index coding problem is 1, and that the
optimal index coding solution with locality 1 is the coding scheme based on
fractional coloring of the interference graph. We propose index coding schemes
with small locality by covering the side information graph using acyclic
subgraphs and subgraphs with small minrank. We also show how locality can be
accounted for in conventional partition multicast and cycle covering solutions
to index coding. Finally, applying these new techniques, we characterize the
locality-broadcast rate trade-off of the index coding problem whose side
information graph is the directed 3-cycle.

estimated, rather than known exactly, and the knockoff copies of the $X_j$'s
are therefore constructed somewhat incorrectly. Our results, which are free of
any modeling assumption whatsoever, show that the resulting model selection
procedure incurs an inflation of the false discovery rate that is proportional
to our errors in estimating the distribution of each feature $X_j$ conditional
on the remaining features $\{X_k:k\neq j\}$. The model-X knockoff framework is
therefore robust to errors in the underlying assumptions on the distribution of
$X$, making it an effective method for many practical applications, such as
genome-wide association studies, where the underlying distribution on the
features $X_1,\dots,X_p$ is estimated accurately but not known exactly.

revealed to host a global two-armed spiral structure. Given the relatively
small projected separation of the binary (1.05"", or ~108 au), gravitational
perturbations by the binary seemed to be a likely driving force behind the
formation of the spiral arms. However, the orbit of these stars remained poorly
understood, which prevented a proper treatment of the dynamical influence of
the companion on the disk. We observed HD 100453AB between 2015-2017 utilizing
extreme adaptive optics systems on the Very Large Telescope and Magellan Clay

data to constrain the parameters of the binary's orbit to a=1.06""+/-0.09"",
e=0.17+/-0.07, and i=32.5+/- 6.5 degrees. We utilized publicly available ALMA
CO data to constrain the inclination of the disk to i~28 degrees, which is
relatively co-planar with the orbit of the companion and consistent with
previous estimates from scattered light images. Finally, we input these
constraints into hydrodynamical and radiative transfer simulations to model the
structural evolution of the disk. We find that the spiral structure and
truncation of the circumprimary disk in HD 100453 are consistent with a
companion-dirven origin. Furthermore, we find that the primary star's rotation,
its outer disk, and the companion exhibit roughly the same direction of angular
momentum, and thus the system likely formed from the same parent body of
material.

Agents in our models are nodes of evolving social networks. The total number of

which colors designate different social categories of agents. The parameter
$\mu$ favors/disfavors connected ""monochromatic triads"", i.e. connected groups
of three individuals \emph{within the same social category}, while the
parameter $\nu$ controls the preference of interactions between two individuals
\emph{from different social categories}. The polychromatic model has several
distinct regimes in $(\mu,\nu)$-parameter space. In $\nu$-dominated region, the
phase diagram is characterized by the plateau in the number of the inter-color
connections, where the network is bipartite, while in $\mu$-dominated region,
the network looks as two weakly connected unicolor clusters. At
$\mu>\mu_{crit}$ and $\nu >\nu_{crit}$ two phases are separated by a critical

two phases occurs. The second ""colorless"" model describes a society in which
the advantage/disadvantage of forming small fully connected communities (short
cycles or cliques in a graph) is controlled by a parameter $\gamma$. We analyze
the topological structure of a social network in this model and demonstrate
that above a critical threshold, $\gamma^+>0$, the entire network splits into a
set of weakly connected clusters, while below another threshold, $\gamma^-<0$,
the network acquires a bipartite graph structure. Our results propose

histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, and the strength of this
interaction determines T cell activation. Optimizing the ability of T cells to
recognize a diversity of foreign peptides yet be tolerant of self-peptides is
crucial for the adaptive immune system to properly function. This is achieved
by selection of T cells in the thymus, where immature T cells expressing
unique, stochastically generated TCRs interact with a large number of
self-peptide-MHC; if a TCR does not bind strongly enough to any
self-peptide-MHC, or too strongly with at least one self-peptide-MHC, the T
cell dies. Past theoretical work cast thymic selection as an extreme value
problem, and characterized the statistical enrichment or depletion of amino
acids in the post-selection TCR repertoire, showing how T cells are selected to
be able to specifically recognize peptides derived from diverse pathogens, yet
have limited self-reactivity. Here, we investigate how the degree of enrichment
is modified by nonuniform contacts that a TCR makes with peptide-MHC.
Specifically, we were motivated by recent experiments showing that amino acids
at certain positions of a TCR sequence have large effects on thymic selection
outcomes, and crystal structure data that reveal a nonuniform contact profile
between a TCR and its peptide-MHC ligand. Using a representative TCR contact
profile as an illustration, we show via simulations that the degree of
enrichment now varies by position according to the contact profile, and,
importantly, it depends on the implementation of nonuniform contacts during
thymic selection. We explain these nontrivial results analytically. Our study
has implications for understanding the selection forces that shape the
functionality of the post-selection TCR repertoire.

that any quantum algorithm that can simulate a piecewise constant bounded local

that features of the VGG network trained on ImageNet classification has been
remarkably useful as a training loss for image synthesis. But how perceptual
are these so-called ""perceptual losses""? What elements are critical for their
success? To answer these questions, we introduce a new dataset of human
perceptual similarity judgments. We systematically evaluate deep features
across different architectures and tasks and compare them with classic metrics.
We find that deep features outperform all previous metrics by large margins on
our dataset. More surprisingly, this result is not restricted to
ImageNet-trained VGG features, but holds across different deep architectures
and levels of supervision (supervised, self-supervised, or even unsupervised).
Our results suggest that perceptual similarity is an emergent property shared

kurtosis of the 21-cm line increases with decreasing $V/\sigma$, and that this
trend is robust across a wide range of masses, signal-to-noise ratios, and
inclinations. We then quantify the shapes of 21-cm line profiles from a
morphologically unbiased sample of $\sim$2000 low-redshift, HI-detected
galaxies with $M_{\rm star} = 10^{7-11} M_{\odot}$ and compare to the simulated
galaxies. At $M_{\rm star} \gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$, both the observed and

wings, consistent with rotation-supported disks. Both the observed and

less-steep wings) at lower masses, indicating increased dispersion support.
However, the simulated galaxies transition from rotation to dispersion support
more strongly: at $M_{\rm star} = 10^{8-10}M_{\odot}$, most of the simulations
produce more Gaussian-like profiles than typical observed galaxies with similar
mass, indicating that gas in the low-mass simulated galaxies is, on average,
overly dispersion-supported. Most of the lower-mass simulated galaxies also
have somewhat lower gas fractions than the median of the observed population.
The simulations nevertheless reproduce the observed line-width baryonic

Galactic Center (GC) has presented an unexpected challenge to theories of star
formation. Kinematics measurements of these stars have revealed a stellar disk
structure (with an apparent 20% disk membership) that has provided important
clues to the origin of these mysterious young stars. However many of the
apparent disk properties are difficult to explain, including the low disk
membership fraction and the high eccentricities, given the youth of this
population. Thus far, all efforts to derive the properties of this disk have
made the simplifying assumption that stars at the GC are single stars.
Nevertheless, stellar binaries are prevalent in our Galaxy, and recent
investigations suggested that they may also be abundant in the Galactic Center.
Here we show that binaries in the disk can largely alter the apparent orbital
properties of the disk. The motion of binary members around each other adds a
velocity component, which can be comparable to the magnitude of the velocity
around the SMBH in the GC. Thus neglecting the contribution of binaries can
significantly vary the inferred stars' orbital properties. While the disk
orientation is unaffected the apparent disk's 2D width is increased to about
11.2deg, similar to the observed width. For a population of stars orbiting the
SMBH with zero eccentricity, unaccounted for binaries will create a wide
apparent eccentricity distribution with an average of 0.23.This is consistent
with the observed average eccentricity of the stars' in the disk. We suggest
that this high eccentricity value, which poses a theoretical challenge, may be
an artifact of binary stars. Finally our results suggest that the actual disk
membership might be significantly higher than the one inferred by observations
that ignore the contribution of binaries, alleviating another theoretical
challenge.

the UVES spectrograph at the ESO VLT Kueyen 8.2m telescope to refine their
chemical composition. We analysed the spectra based on 1D LTE model

carbon-enhanced and belong to the low-carbon band, defined in the TOPoS II
paper. We measured lithium (A(Li)=1.9) in the most iron-poor star (SDSS
J1035+0641, [Fe/H] < -5.2 ). We were also able to measure Li in three stars at
[Fe/H]~ -4.0, two of which lie on the Spite plateau. We confirm that SDSS
J1349+1407 is extremely rich in Mg, but not in Ca. It is also very rich in Na.
Several of our stars are characterised by low alpha-to-iron ratios. The lack of
high-carbon band stars at low metallicity can be understood in terms of
evolutionary timescales of binary systems. The detection of Li in SDSS
J1035+0641 places a strong constraint on theories that aim at solving the
cosmological lithium problem. The Li abundance of the two warmer stars at
[Fe/H]~ -4.0 places them on the Spite plateau, while the third, cooler star,
lies below. We argue that this suggests that the temperature at which Li
depletion begins increases with decreasing [Fe/H]. SDSS J1349+1407 may belong
to a class of Mg-rich EMP stars. We cannot assess if there is a scatter in
alpha-to-iron ratios among the EMP stars or if there are several discrete

We implement a number of color and geometric corrections (such as flat field,

formation and that most (if not all) stars form in dense stellar clusters. In
this monolithic formation scenario, low density OB associations are formed from
the expansion of gravitationally bound clusters following gas expulsion due to
stellar feedback. $N$-body simulations of this process show that OB
associations formed this way retain signs of expansion and elevated radial
anisotropy over tens of Myr. However, recent theoretical and observational
studies suggest that star formation is a hierarchical process, following the
fractal nature of natal molecular clouds and allowing the formation of
large-scale associations in-situ. We distinguish between these two scenarios by
characterising the kinematics of OB associations using the Tycho-$Gaia$
Astrometric Solution catalogue. To this end, we quantify four key kinematic
diagnostics: the number ratio of stars with positive radial velocities to those
with negative radial velocities, the median radial velocity, the median radial
velocity normalised by the tangential velocity, and the radial anisotropy
parameter. Each quantity presents a useful diagnostic of whether the
association was more compact in the past. We compare these diagnostics to
models representing random motion and the expanding products of monolithic
cluster formation. None of these diagnostics show evidence of expansion, either
from a single cluster or multiple clusters, and the observed kinematics are
better represented by a random velocity distribution. This result favours the
hierarchical star formation model in which a minority of stars forms in bound

discovered in the UKIDSS UDS field, made of ~20 galaxy groups and clusters,
spreading over 10 Mpc. We report on a VLT/VIMOS spectroscopic follow-up program
that, combined with past spectroscopy, allowed us to confirm four galaxy
clusters (M200 ~ 10^14 Msol) and a dozen associated groups and star-forming
galaxy overdensities. Two additional filamentary structures at z ~ 0.62 and z ~
0.69 and foreground and background clusters at 0.6 < z < 0.7 were also
confirmed along the line-of-sight. The structure subcomponents are at different
formation stages. The clusters have a core dominated by passive galaxies and an
established red sequence. The remaining structures are a mix of star-forming
galaxy overdensities and forming groups. The presence of quiescent galaxies in
the core of the latter shows that `preprocessing' has already happened before
the groups fall into their more massive neighbours. Our spectroscopy allows us
to derive spectral index measurements e.g. emission/absorption line equivalent
widths, strength of the 4000A break, valuable to investigate the star formation
history of structure members. Based on these line measurements, we select a
population of `poststarburst' galaxies. These galaxies are preferentially found
within the virial radius of clusters, supporting a scenario in which their
recent quenching could be prompted by gas stripping by the dense intracluster
medium. We derive stellar age estimates using MCMC-based spectral fitting for
quiescent galaxies and find a correlation between ages and colours/stellar
masses which favours a top-down formation scenario of the red sequence. A
catalogue of ~650 redshifts in UDS will be released alongside the paper.

In particular, Ness & Lang (2016) reported a direct detection of a faint

affected substantially by whether the conventional dust extinction correction
is applied or not and partly by a bulge model subtracted from the original

boxy bulge models from the dereddened images show no obvious X-shaped

weak-lensing surveys, which can affect the derived cosmological parameters. One
direct way to distinguish different alignment models and quantify their effects
on the measurement is to produce mocked weak-lensing surveys. In this work, we
use full-sky ray-tracing technique to produce mock images of galaxies from the
ELUCID $N$-body simulation run with the WMAP9 cosmology. In our model we assume
that the shape of central elliptical galaxy follows that of the dark matter
halo, and spiral galaxy follows the halo spin. Using the mocked galaxy images,
a combination of galaxy intrinsic shape and the gravitational shear, we compare
the predicted tomographic shear correlations to the results of KiDS and DLS. It
is found that our predictions stay between the KiDS and DLS results. We rule
out a model in which the satellite galaxies are radially aligned with the
center galaxy, otherwise the shear-correlations on small scales are too high.
Most important, we find that although the intrinsic alignment of spiral
galaxies is very weak, they induce a positive correlation between the
gravitational shear signal and the intrinsic galaxy orientation (GI). This is
because the spiral galaxy is tangentially aligned with the nearby large-scale
overdensity, contrary to the radial alignment of elliptical galaxy. Our results
explain the origin of detected positive GI term from the weak-lensing surveys.
We conclude that in future analysis, the GI model must include the dependence
on galaxy types in more detail.

potential energy of the gas was converted to thermal energy through this

not been clearly characterized in connection with with the formation and
evolution of the internal structure of dark-matter halos. Here, we show that
observational CLASH data of high-mass galaxy clusters lie on a plane in the

$M_s$, and X-ray temperature $T_X$ with a very small orthogonal scatter. The
tight correlation indicates that the gas temperature was determined at a
specific cluster formation time, which is encoded in $r_s$ and $M_s$. The plane
is tilted with respect to $T_X \propto M_s/r_s$, which is the plane expected in
case of simplified virial equilibrium. We show that this tilt can be explained
by a similarity solution, which indicates that clusters are not isolated but
continuously growing through matter accretion from their outer environments.
Numerical simulations reproduce the observed plane and its angle. This result
holds independently of the gas physics implemented in the code, revealing the

narrow width approximation, and one that implements NLO corrections for both
production and decay including finite-width and interference effects. Since our
aim is to provide an assessment of the uncertainties of purely theoretical

experimental resolution effects with simple smearing procedures. We estimate
the differences in the value of the extracted top mass that would occur due to
the use of the three different NLO generators, to the variation of scales, to
the choice of parton distribution functions and to the matching procedure.
Furthermore, we also consider differences due to the shower and to the
modelling of non-perturbative effects by interfacing our NLO generators to both
Pythia8.2 and Herwig7.1, with various settings. We find very different results

NLTE excitation model to include UV fluorescence, finding it plays a key role
in CO and CN excitation, and use it to turn the SMA CN/CO flux ratio constraint
into an upper limit of $<2.5$% on the HCN/(CO+CO$_2$) ratio of outgassing
rates. This value is consistent with, but at the low end of, the broad range
observed in Solar System comets. If sublimation dominates outgassing, then this
low value may be caused by decreased outgassing for the less volatile molecule
HCN compared to CO. If instead UV photodesorption or collisional vaporization
of unbound grains dominates outgassing, then this low ratio of rates would
imply a low ice abundance ratio, which would in turn indicate a variation in
cometary cyanide abundances across planetary systems. To conclude, we make
predictions for future molecular surveys and show that CN and HCN should be
readily detectable with ALMA around $\beta$ Pictoris for Solar-System-like

transfer modeling is used to demonstrate that the emission morphology can be
reasonably reproduced with a $^{12}$CO column density profile featuring a steep

Similar features have been identified in observations of rarer CO

obtained for stellar halos sets a limit of about $12\%$ (after adjusting for
random uncertainty) on the accuracy with which the mass profiles of the Milky

limit is independent of the quantity and quality of the observational data. The
reason for a non zero bias is not clear, hence its interpretation is not

temporally correlated SNe that drive strong outflows, consisting of hot
(T>5x10^5K) winds and warm (5050K < T < 2x10^4K) fountains. The hot gas at
distance d>1kpc from the midplane has mass and energy fluxes nearly constant
with d. The hot flow escapes our local Cartesian box barely affected by gravity
and is expected to accelerate up to the terminal velocity of
v_wind~350-500km/s. The mean mass and energy loading factors of the hot wind
are 0.1 and 0.02, respectively. For warm gas, the mean outward mass flux
through d=1kpc is comparable to the mean star formation rate, but only a small
fraction of this gas is at velocity >50km/s. Thus, the warm outflows eventually
fall back as inflows. The warm fountain flows are created by expanding hot
superbubbles at d< 1kpc; at larger d neither ram pressure acceleration nor
cooling transfers significant momentum or energy flux from the hot wind to the
warm outflow. The velocity distribution at launching near d~1kpc better
represents warm outflows than a single mass loading factor, potentially
enabling development of subgrid models for warm galactic winds in arbitrary

NP-hard in the general RAF setting. We then show how this simplified setting
for RAF systems leads naturally to a more general notion of RAFs that are
`generative' (they can be built up from simpler RAFs) and for which efficient
algorithms carry over to this more general setting. Finally, we show how
classical RAF theory can be extended to deal with ensembles of catalysts as
well as the assignment of rates to reactions according to which catalysts (or
combinations of catalysts) are available.

Although these methods can be quite capable, they do not scale well with the

We consider learning a forward dynamics model to predict the result,

of the state, ($x_{t}$). With this model we perform internal look-ahead

single stars and have been found to frequently have orbital radii just beyond
the critical distance for dynamical stability. Assessing the stability is
typically done either through N-body simulations or using the stability
criterion first considered by Dvorak and later developed by Holman and Wiegert:
a second-order polynomial calibrated to broadly match numerical simulations.
However, the polynomial is unable to capture islands of instability introduced
by mean motion resonances, causing the accuracy of the criterion to approach
that of a random coin-toss when close to the boundary. We show how a deep
neural network (DNN) trained on N-body simulations generated with REBOUND is
able to significantly improve stability predictions for circumbinary planets on
initially coplanar, circular orbits. Specifically, we find that the accuracy of
our DNN never drops below 86%, even when tightly surrounding the boundary of
instability, and is fast enough to be practical for on-the-fly calls during
likelihood evaluations typical of modern Bayesian inference. Our binary

masses compared to the previous CMS result. In the neutralino pair production
model, the combined observed (expected) exclusion limit on the neutralino mass
extends up to 650-750 (550-750) GeV, depending on the branching fraction
assumed. This extends the observed exclusion achieved in the individual

galaxy, at a redshift of 0.26, is associated with a radio source of
flat/inverted spectrum at high radio frequencies. The analysis of its optical
spectrum obtained in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) revealed a small
linewidth of the broad component of the H{\beta} line (full width at
half-maximum = 1585 km s^{-1}), making it a radio-loud NLS1 galaxy -- an
intriguing class of active galactic nuclei with exceptional multiwavelength
properties. A new {\gamma}-ray source centred at J2118-0732 was sporadically
detected during 2009--2013 in form of flares by the Fermi-LAT. Our XMM-Newton
observations revealed a flat X-ray spectrum described by a simple power law,
and a flux variation by a factor of ~2.5 in five months. The source also shows
intraday variability in the infrared band. Its broad-band spectral energy
distribution can be modelled by emission from a simple one-zone leptonic jet
model, and the flux drop from infrared to X-rays in five months can be
explained by changes of the jet parameters, though the exact values may be
subject to relatively large uncertainties. With the NLS1-blazar composite
nucleus, the clear detection of the host galaxy, and the synchronous variations
in the multiwavelength fluxes, J2118-0732 provides a new perspective on the
formation and evolution of relativistic jets under the regime of relatively
small black hole masses and high accretion rates.

flashes of unknown physical origin. FRB 121102, the only known repeating FRB

redshift z = 0.193, and is spatially coincident with a compact, persistent
radio source. The origin of the bursts, the nature of the persistent source,
and the properties of the local environment are still debated. Here we present
bursts that show ~100% linearly polarized emission at a very high and variable
Faraday rotation measure in the source frame: RM_src = +1.46 x 10^5 rad m^-2
and +1.33 x 10^5 rad m^-2 at epochs separated by 7 months, in addition to
narrow (< 30 mus) temporal structure. The large and variable rotation measure
demonstrates that FRB 121102 is in an extreme and dynamic magneto-ionic
environment, while the short burst durations argue for a neutron star origin.
Such large rotation measures have, until now, only been observed in the
vicinities of massive black holes (M_BH > 10^4 MSun). Indeed, the properties of
the persistent radio source are compatible with those of a low-luminosity,
accreting massive black hole. The bursts may thus come from a neutron star in
such an environment. However, the observed properties may also be explainable
in other models, such as a highly magnetized wind nebula or supernova remnant
surrounding a young neutron star.

to show that a measurement of $\Omega_{\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}}h^{2}$ can be
achieved from measurements at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Focus is placed
on compressed mass spectra regions, where the mass difference between the
$\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}$ and the $\tilde{\tau}_{1}$ is small and where the
$\tilde{\tau}_{1}$-$\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}$ coannihilation (CA) mechanism of the

Gr\""obner basis computation, our approach computes the polynomial ideal of the

sequentially until a fixed point is reached. This fixed point represents the
polynomial ideal of all polynomial invariants of the given extended P-solvable

m program variables and r conditional branches we prove an upper bound of m*r

star, we find evidence for a significant 42 day signal after subtraction of
longer period magnetic cycles, casting doubt on the planetary hypothesis for
this period. Although our statistical model strongly suggests that the 42-day
signal is Doppler in origin, we conclude that the residual effects of stellar
rotation are difficult to fully model and remove from this dataset,
highlighting the difficulties to disentangle small planetary signals and
photospheric noise, particularly when the orbital periods are close to the
rotation period of the star. This study serves as an excellent test case for
future works that aim to detect small planets orbiting `Sun-like' stars using
radial velocity measurements.

collects status updates from multiple terminals, e.g., sensors and monitors,
through a wireless multiaccess uplink, an important problem is how to attain
timely status updates autonomously. In this paper, the timeliness of the status
is measured by the recently proposed age-of-information (AoI) metric; both the
theoretical and practical aspects of the problem are investigated: we aim to
obtain a scheduling policy with minimum AoI and, meanwhile, still suitable for
decentralized implementation on account of signalling exchange overhead.
Towards this end, we first consider the set of arrival-independent and renewal
(AIR) policies; the optimal policy thereof to minimize the time-average AoI is
proved to be a round-robin policy with one-packet (latest packet only and
others are dropped) buffers (RR-ONE). The optimality is established based on a
generalized Poisson-arrival-see-time-average (PASTA) theorem. It is further
proved that RR-ONE is asymptotically optimal among all policies in the massive
IoT regime. The AoI steady-state stationary distribution under RR-ONE is also
derived. A fully decentralized implementation of RR-ONE is proposed which can
accommodate dynamic terminal appearances. In addition, considering scenarios
where packets cannot be dropped, the optimal AIR policy thereof is also found
with parameters given by the solution to a convex problem.

to the \ha\ and \nii\ emission lines, develop an MCMC code to robustly estimate
the error of fit parameters, and use the F-test to determine the best number of
kinematic components for each fiber. We use \nii/\ha\ and velocity dispersion
of components to separate star-forming (HII) regions from shocks. We use the
kinematics of the \ha\ emission from HII regions and an automated modeling
method to put the first-ever constraints on the encounter parameters of one of

have, on average, a higher shock fraction than wide pairs, and coalesced
mergers have the highest average $\text{f}_\text{shocked}$. In addition, galaxy
pairs with more equal mass ratio tend to have a higher

Convergence of their corresponding expected values, including a convergence

the Kepler exoplanet candidates, we have identified two natural divisions of
planet radius at 4 Earth radii and 10 Earth radii. These divisions place
constraints on planet formation and interior structure model. The division at 4
Earth radii separates small exoplanets from large exoplanets above. When
combined with the recently-discovered radius gap at 2 Earth radii, it supports
the treatment of planets 2-4 Earth radii as a separate group, likely water
worlds. Thus, for planets around solar-type FGK main-sequence stars, we argue
that 2 Earth radii is the separation between water-poor and water-rich planets,
and 4 Earth radii is the separation between gas-poor and gas-rich planets. We
confirm that the slope of survival function in between 4 and 10 Earth radii to
be shallower compared to either ends, indicating a relative paucity of planets
in between 4-10 Earth radii, namely, the sub-Saturnian desert there. We name
them transitional planets, as they form a bridge between the gas-poor small
planets and gas giants. Accordingly, we propose the following classification
scheme: (<2 Earth radii) rocky planets, (2-4 Earth radii) water worlds, (4-10

cut-off of 0.05 AU to the host star. More specifically, this inner cut-off is
0.04 AU for rocky worlds (1-2 Earth radii) and 0.08 AU for water worlds (2-4
Earth radii). Moreover, the transitional planets (4-10 Earth radii) and gas
giants (>10 Earth radii) have a change of slope of survival function at 0.4 AU
from -1 to -1/2, suggesting a different statistical distribution uniform in
\Sqrt[a] inside 0.4 AU, compared to small exoplanets (<4 Earth radii). This
difference in distribution is likely caused by the difference in planet
migration mechanism, and susceptibility to host stellar irradiation, for
gas-poor (<4 Earth radii) versus gas-rich (>4 Earth radii) planets. Armed with
this knowledge and combined with the survival function analysis of planet size
distribution, we can make precise estimates of planet occurrence rate and

find that by altering the model such that Eve's copy of the initial round of
feedback is corrupted by an iota of noise, one step towards physical relevance,
the capacity can be increased dramatically. It is known that the private
capacity with respect to the original model for a pure-loss bosonic channel is
at most $- \log(1-\eta)$ bits per mode, where $\eta$ is the transmissivity, in
the limit of infinite input photon number. This is a very pessimistic result as
there is a finite rate limit even with an arbitrarily large number of input
photons. We refer to this as a loss limited rate. However, in our altered model
we find that we can achieve a rate of $(1/2) \log(1 + 4 \eta N_S)$ bits per
mode, where $N_S$ is the input photon number. This rate diverges with $N_S$, in
sharp contrast to the result for the original model. This suggests that
physical considerations behind the eavesdropping model should be taken more
seriously, as they can create strong dependencies of the achievable rates on
the model. For by a seemingly inconsequential weakening of Eve, we obtain a
loss-unlimited rate. Our protocol also works verbatim for arbitrary i.i.d.
noise (not even necessarily Gaussian) injected by Eve in every round, and even
if Eve is given access to copies of the initial transmission and noise. The
error probability of the protocol decays super-exponentially with the

quantifying the morphology of the hot intracluster medium in clusters of

high-quality X-ray observations making them difficult to apply to large surveys
of groups and clusters. Here, we compare optical relaxation proxies with X-ray
asymmetries and centroid shifts for a sample of SDSS clusters with
high-quality, archival X-ray data from Chandra and XMM-Newton. The three
optical relaxation measures considered are: the shape of the member-galaxy
projected velocity distribution -- measured by the Anderson-Darling (AD)
statistic, the stellar mass gap between the most-massive and
second-most-massive cluster galaxy, and the offset between the most-massive
galaxy (MMG) position and the luminosity-weighted cluster centre. The AD
statistic and stellar mass gap correlate significantly with X-ray relaxation
proxies, with the AD statistic being the stronger correlator. Conversely, we
find no evidence for a correlation between X-ray asymmetry or centroid shift
and the MMG offset. High-mass clusters ($M_\mathrm{halo} >
10^{14.5}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$) in this sample have X-ray asymmetries, centroid
shifts, and Anderson-Darling statistics which are systematically larger than
for low-mass systems. Finally, considering the dichotomy of Gaussian and
non-Gaussian clusters (measured by the AD test), we show that the probability
of being a non-Gaussian cluster correlates significantly with X-ray asymmetry
but only shows a marginal correlation with centroid shift. These results
confirm the shape of the radial velocity distribution as a useful proxy for
cluster relaxation, which can then be applied to large redshift surveys lacking
extensive X-ray coverage.

Ce(Pd$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_2$P$_2$ is reported, where a possible ferromagnetic
quantum critical point is uncovered in the temperature - concentration ($T-x$)
phase diagram. This behavior results from the simultaneous contraction of the
unit cell volume, which tunes the relative strengths of the Kondo and RKKY
interactions, and the introduction of disorder through alloying. Near the
critical region at $x_{\rm{cr}}$ $\approx$ 0.7, the rate of contraction of the
unit cell volume strengthens, indicating that the cerium $f$-valence crosses
over from trivalent to a non-integer value. Consistent with this picture, x-ray
absorption spectroscopy measurements reveal that while CePd$_2$P$_2$ has a
purely trivalent cerium $f$-state, CeNi$_2$P$_2$ has a small ($<$ 10 \%)
tetravalent contribution. In a broad region around $x_{\rm{cr}}$, there is a
breakdown of Fermi liquid temperature dependences, signaling the influence of
quantum critical fluctuations and disorder effects. Measurements of clean
CePd$_2$P$_2$ furthermore show that applied pressure has a similar initial
effect to alloying on the ferromagnetic order. From these results,
CePd$_2$P$_2$ emerges as a keystone system to test theories such as the
Belitz-Kirkpatrick-Vojta model for ferromagnetic quantum criticality, where
distinct behaviors are expected in the dirty and clean limits.

reported according to angiographic criteria which don't consider the relation
between the resulting effective flow distal to the stenosis and the demand of a
hypertrophied myocardial tissue.
  MODEL: Mathematical model of the myocardial perfusion in comorbid CAD and
ventricular hypertrophy using Poiseuille's law. The analysis yields that the
curve, which represents the relation between the perfusion and the severity of
CAD depending on angiographic and/or angiophysiologic criteria, is shifted to
the right by the effect of myocardial tissue hypertrophy. The right shift of
said curve, which is directly proportional to the degree of ventricular
hypertrophy, indicates that the perfusion of the corresponding myocardial
tissue is compromised at angiographically and/or angiophysiologically
subsignificant stenosis of the supplying epicardial vessel.
  RESULTS: Patients with comorbid CAD and left ventricular hypertrophy are more
sensitive to CAD-related hemodynamic changes. They are more prone to develop
ischemic complications, than their peers with isolated CAD regarding the same
degree of coronary stenosis.
  CONCLUSION: Patients with comorbid CAD and ventricular hypertrophy suffer
from myocardial hypoperfusion at angiographically and/or angiophysiologically
subcritical epicardial stenosis. Accordingly; the comorbidity of both diseases
should be considered upon designing of the treatment regime.

non-intrusive, passive nature, and high information content, vision is an
attractive sensing modality, particularly at shallower depths. However, factors

color distortion affect the quality of visual data, resulting in noisy and

to balance supply and demand. A challenge is to set prices that are
appropriately smooth in space and time, so that drivers with the flexibility to
decide how to work will nevertheless choose to accept their dispatched trips,
rather than drive to another area or wait for higher prices or a better trip.
In this work, we propose a complete information model that is simple yet rich
enough to incorporate spatial imbalance and temporal variations in supply and
demand -- conditions that lead to market failures in today's platforms. We
introduce the Spatio-Temporal Pricing (STP) mechanism. The mechanism is
incentive-aligned, in that it is a subgame-perfect equilibrium for drivers to
always accept their trip dispatches. From any history onward, the equilibrium
outcome of the STP mechanism is welfare-optimal, envy-free, individually
rational, budget balanced, and core-selecting. We also prove the impossibility
of achieving the same economic properties in a dominant-strategy equilibrium.
Simulation results show that the STP mechanism can achieve substantially
improved social welfare and earning equity than a myopic mechanism.

However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that it is
addressed from the perspective of multiscale analysis. Once the multiscale
analysis is set up our method gives easy access to analyticity: Essentially, it
amounts to proving it for isolated eigenvalues only and use that uniform limits

distribution function (PDF) of the CO integrated intensity (I_CO), peak
temperature, and velocity dispersion for a region with each structure. We find
that the I_CO PDF for the bar shows a bright-end tail while that for the arm
does not. Since the star formation efficiency is lower in the bar, this
difference in PDF shape is contrary to the trend in Milky Way studies where the
bright-end tail is found for star-forming molecular clouds. While the peak
temperature PDFs are similar for bar and arm regions, velocity dispersion in
bar is systematically larger than in arm. This large velocity dispersion is
likely a major cause of the bright-end tail and of suppressed star formation.
We also investigate an effect of stellar feedback to PDF profiles and find that
the different I_CO PDFs between bar and arm regions cannot be explained by the
feedback effect, at least at the current spatial scale.

spectral transition from hard to soft state, which is implemented by the
decrease of the truncation radius of the outer disk towards Innermost Stable
Circular Orbit (ISCO). In the hard state where the Comptonizing flow is
geometrically thick, the Comptonization is weakly variable with the fractional
variability amplitude of $\leq$10\%; in the soft state where the Comptonizing

and posing rigorous latency requirements to service providers. While resource
sharing across multiple service providers can be a way to maximize the
utilization of limited resources at the network edge, it requires a centralized
repository maintained by all parties for service providers to share status.
Moreover, service providers have to trust each other for resource allocation
fairness, which is difficult because of potential conflicts of interest. We
propose EdgeChain, a blockchain-based architecture to make mobile edge
application placement decisions for multiple service providers. We first
formulate a stochastic programming problem minimizing the placement cost for
mobile edge application placement scenarios. Based on our model, we present a
heuristic mobile edge application placement algorithm. As a decentralized
public ledger, the blockchain then takes the logic of our algorithm as the
smart contract, with the consideration of resources from all mobile edge hosts
participating in the system. The algorithm is agreed by all parties and the
results will only be accepted by majority of the mining nodes on the
blockchain. When a placement decision is made, an edge host meeting the
consumer's latency and budget requirements will be selected at the lowest cost.
All placement transactions are stored on the blockchain and are traceable by
every mobile edge service provider and application vendor who consumes
resources at the mobile edge.

the parameters that describe the relations between the distributions of
kinematical properties and age. This parametrization allows us to obtain an age
probability from the kinematical data. From this age pdf, we estimate an
individual average age for the star using the most likely age and the expected
age. We have obtained the stellar age pdf for the age of $9\,102$ stars from
the GCS and have shown that the distribution of individual ages derived from
our method is in good agreement with the distribution of isochronal ages. We
also observe a decline in the mean metallicity with our ages for stars younger
than 7 Gyr, similar to the one observed for isochronal ages. This method can be
useful for the estimation of rough stellar ages for those stars that fall in
areas of the HR diagram where isochrones are tightly crowded. As an example of
this method, we estimate the age of Trappist-1, which is a M8V star, obtaining
the age of $t(UVW) = 12.50(+0.29-6.23)$ Gyr.

data at the individual worker nodes. The individual worker nodes iteratively
update their estimate of the parameter by assimilating latest locally sensed
information and estimates from neighboring worker nodes exchanged over a
(possibly sparse) time-varying communication graph. The underlying inter-worker
communication protocol is adaptive, making communications increasingly
(probabilistically) sparse as time progresses. Under minimal conditions on the
inter-worker information exchange network and the sensing models, almost sure
convergence of the estimate sequences at the worker nodes to the true parameter
is established. Further, the paper characterizes the performance of
$\mathcal{CREDO}$ in terms of asymptotic covariance of the estimate sequences
and specifically establishes the achievability of optimal asymptotic
covariance. The analysis reveals an interesting interplay between the
algorithm's communication cost~$\mathcal{C}_{t}$ (over $t$ time-steps) and the

  We demonstrate these noise benefits on EM algorithms for the Gaussian mixture
model (GMM) with both additive and multiplicative NEM noise injection. A
separate theorem (not presented here) shows that the noise benefit for
independent identically distributed additive noise decreases with sample size
in mixture models. This theorem implies that the noise benefit is most
pronounced if the data is sparse. Injecting blind noise only slowed
convergence.

evolutionarily conserved motif present in all eukaryotic cells, is involved in
coordinating critical cell-fate decisions, regulating protein synthesis, and
mediating learning and memory. While the steady-state behavior of the pathway
stimulated by a time-invariant signal is relatively well-understood, we show
using a computational model that it exhibits a rich repertoire of transient
adaptive responses to changes in stimuli. When the signal is switched on, the
response is characterized by long-lived modulations in frequency as well as
amplitude. On withdrawing the stimulus, the activity decays over timescales
much longer than that of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation processes,
exhibiting reverberations characterized by repeated spiking in the activated
MAPK concentration. The long-term persistence of such post-stimulus activity
suggests that the cascade retains memory of the signal for a significant
duration following its removal, even in the absence of any explicit feedback or
cross-talk with other pathways. We find that the molecular mechanism underlying
this behavior is related to the existence of distinct relaxation rates for the
different cascade components. This results in the imbalance of fluxes between
different layers of the cascade, with the repeated reuse of activated kinases
as enzymes when they are released from sequestration in complexes leading to
one or more spike events following the removal of the stimulus. The persistent
adaptive response reported here, indicative of a cellular ""short-term"" memory,
suggests that this ubiquitous signaling pathway plays an even more central role
in information processing by eukaryotic cells.

characterization calls for accurate electronic-structure theory to interpret
x-ray near-edge fine structure. In this work, we propose an efficient and
unified framework to describe all the many-electron processes in a Fermi liquid
after a sudden perturbation (such as a core hole). This problem has been
visited by the Mahan-Nozi\'eres-De Dominicis (MND) theory, but it is
intractable to implement various Feynman diagrams within first-principles
calculations. Here, we adopt a non-diagrammatic approach and treat all the
many-electron processes in the MND theory on an equal footing. Starting from a
recently introduced determinant formalism [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 096402
(2017)], we exploit the linear-dependence of determinants describing different
final states involved in the spectral calculations. An elementary graph
algorithm, breadth-first search, can be used to quickly identify the important
determinants for shaping the spectrum, which avoids the need to evaluate a
great number of vanishingly small terms. This search algorithm is performed
over the tree-structure of the many-body expansion, which mimics a path-finding
process. We demonstrate that the determinantal approach is computationally
inexpensive even for obtaining x-ray spectra of extended systems. Using
Kohn-Sham orbitals from two self-consistent fields (ground and core-excited
state) as input for constructing the determinants, the calculated x-ray spectra
for a number of transition metal oxides are in good agreement with experiments.
Many-electron aspects beyond the Bethe-Salpeter equation, as captured by this
approach, are also discussed, such as shakeup excitations and many-body wave
function overlap considered in Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe.

of two high-spin open-shell molecules (described by their restricted open-shell
Hartree-Fock determinants) resulting in low-spin states of the complex. The
previously available SAPT formalisms, except for some system-specific studies
for few-electron complexes, were restricted to the high-spin state of the
interacting system. Thus, the new approach provides, for the first time, a
SAPT-based estimate of the splittings between different spin states of the
complex. We have derived and implemented the lowest-order SAPT term responsible
for these splittings, that is, the first-order exchange energy. We show that
within the so-called S2 approximation commonly used in SAPT (neglecting effects
that vanish as fourth or higher powers of intermolecular overlap integrals),
the first-order exchange energies for all multiplets are linear combinations of
two matrix elements: a diagonal exchange term that determines the spin-averaged
effect and a {\em spin-flip term} responsible for the splittings between the
states. The numerical factors in this linear combination are determined solely
by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients: accordingly, the S2 approximation implies a
Heisenberg Hamiltonian picture with a single coupling strength parameter
determining all the splittings. The new approach is cast into both
molecular-orbital and atomic-orbital expressions: the latter enable an
efficient density-fitted implementation. We test the newly developed formalism
on several open-shell complexes ranging from diatomic systems (Li+H, Mn+Mn,...)

are however coherent along one line of sight, and various methods of foreground
subtraction based on this property have been proposed. In this paper, we
present a new method based on the Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) to
subtract foreground and extract 21~cm signal, which explicitly uses both the
low-rank property of the frequency covariance matrix (i.e. frequency coherence)
of the foreground and the sparsity of the frequency covariance matrix of the
21~cm signal. The low-rank property of the foregrounds frequency covariance has
been exploited in many previous works on foreground subtraction, but to our
knowledge the sparsity of the frequency covariance of the 21~cm signal is first
explored here. By exploiting both properties in the RPCA method, in principle,
the foreground and signal may be separated without the signal loss problem. Our
method is applicable to both small patch of sky with the flat-sky
approximation, and to large area of sky where the sphericity has to be
considered. It is also easy to be extended to deal with more complex conditions
such as sky map with defects.

that in the metric one, which becomes more and more obvious with the increase

we find that the inflaton quanta are produced explosively due to the parameter
resonance and the growth of inflaton quanta will be terminated by the
backreaction. With the increase of $|\xi|$, the resonance bands gradually close
to the zero momentum ($k=0$), and the structure of resonance changes and
becomes broader and broader in the metric formalism, while, it remains to be
narrow in the Palatini formalism. The energy transfer from the inflaton field
to the fluctuation becomes more and more efficient with the increase of
$|\xi|$, and in the metric formalism the growth of the efficiency of energy
transfer is much faster than that in the Palatini formalism. Therefore, the

  Verification in UAV Image Matching","31 pages; 11104 words",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a strategy for efficient geometrical verification in
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) image matching. First, considering the complex
transformation model between correspondence set in the image-space, feature
points of initial candidate matches are projected onto an elevation plane in
the object-space, with assistant of UAV flight control data and camera mounting
angles. Spatial relationships are simplified as a 2D-translation in which a
motion establishes the relation of two correspondence points. Second, a
hierarchical motion consistency constraint, termed HMCC, is designed to
eliminate outliers from initial candidate matches, which includes three major
steps, namely the global direction consistency constraint, the local
direction-change consistency constraint and the global length consistency
constraint. To cope with scenarios with high outlier ratios, the HMCC is
achieved by using a voting scheme. Finally, an efficient geometrical
verification strategy is proposed by using the HMCC as a pre-processing step to
increase inlier ratios before the consequent application of the basic RANSAC
algorithm. The performance of the proposed strategy is verified through
comprehensive comparison and analysis by using real UAV datasets captured with
different photogrammetric systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the
generated motions have noticeable separation ability, and the HMCC-RANSAC
algorithm can efficiently eliminate outliers based on the motion consistency
constraint, with a speedup ratio reaching to 6 for oblique UAV images. Even
though the completeness sacrifice of approximately 7 percent of points is
observed from image orientation tests, competitive orientation accuracy is
achieved from all used datasets. For geometrical verification of both nadir and
oblique UAV images, the proposed method can be a more efficient solution.

Ch{\^a}tel and Pons in order to describe some interesting families of intervals
in the Tamari lattices. These families are defined as interval-posets avoiding
specific configurations. At first, we consider what we call exceptional
interval-posets and show that they correspond to the intervals which are
obtained as images of noncrossing trees in the Dendriform operad. We also show
that the exceptional intervals are exactly the intervals of the Tamari lattice
induced by intervals in the poset of noncrossing partitions. In the second part
we introduce the notion of modern and infinitely modern interval-posets. We
show that the modern intervals are in bijection with the new intervals of the
Tamari lattice in the sense of Chapoton. We deduce an intrinsic
characterization of the new intervals in the Tamari lattice. Finally, we
consider the family of what we call infinitely modern intervals and we we prove
that there are as many infinitely modern interval-posets of size n as there are
ternary trees with n inner vertices.

a table-clearing task in simulation (201 participants) and with a real robot

low-risk objects first. Interestingly, the robot sometimes fails intentionally
in order to modulate human trust and achieve the best team performance. These
results show that the trust-POMDP calibrates trust to improve human-robot team
performance over the long term. Further, they highlight that maximizing trust
alone does not always lead to the best performance.

references, since many of these services are \emph{location-enhanced} and thus
produce spatio-temporal records of their usage. We postulate that the
spatio-temporal usage records belonging to the same real-world entity can be
matched across records from different location-enhanced services. Linking
spatio-temporal records enables data analysts and service providers to obtain
information that they cannot derive by analyzing only one set of usage records.
In this paper, we develop a new \emph{linkage model} that can be used to match
entities from two sets of spatio-temporal usage records belonging to two
different location-enhanced services. This linkage model is based on the
concept of $k$-$l$ \emph{diversity} --- that we developed to capture both
spatial and temporal aspects of the linkage. To realize this linkage model in
practice, we develop a scalable linking algorithm called \emph{ST-Link}, which
makes use of effective spatial and temporal filtering mechanisms that
significantly reduce the search space for matching users. Furthermore,
\emph{ST-Link} utilizes sequential scan procedures to avoid random disk access
and thus scales to large datasets. We evaluated our work with respect to
accuracy and performance using several datasets. Experiments show that
\emph{ST-Link} is effective in practice for performing spatio-temporal linkage
and can scale to large datasets.

However, channel training procedure is vulnerable to the pilot spoofing attack

inevitably results in severe private information leakage. In this paper, we
propose a random channel training (RCT) based secure downlink transmission
framework for a time division duplex (TDD) multiple antennas base station (BS).
In the proposed RCT scheme, multiple orthogonal pilot sequences (PSs) are
simultaneously allocated to the legitimate user (LU), and the LU randomly
selects one PS from the assigned PS set to transmit. Under either the PSA or
PJA, we provide the detailed steps for the BS to identify the PS transmitted by
the LU, and to simultaneously estimate channels of the LU and Eve. The
probability that the BS makes an incorrect decision on the PS of the LU is
analytically investigated. Finally, closed-form secure beamforming (SB) vectors
are designed and optimized to enhance the secrecy rates during the downlink
transmissions. Numerical results show that the secrecy performance is greatly
improved compared to the conventional channel training scheme wherein only one
PS is assigned to the LU.

accomplished by bringing a pod to a storage location different than the one it

a high gradient fields at the bubble closure, with magnitudes high enough to
ionise by tunnelling effect the still bounded electrons (of a high-Z dopant).
The ionised electrons are captured by the nonlinear plasma wave at the
accelerating and focusing wake phase leading to high-brightness trailing
bunches. The high transformer ratio guarantees that the ionisation only occurs
at the bubble closure. The quality of the ionisation-injected trailing bunches
strongly and non-linearly depends on the properties of the dopant gas (density
and initial ionisation state). We use the full 3D PIC code ${\tt ALaDyn}$ to

disappear for disordered and on-substrate devices. With the help of mean-field

phase transition between the two CDW states. To affirm this idea, we vary the

on the free surface of a deep non-conducting liquid with high dielectric

simulated. The computational method is based on the time-dependent conformal
transformation of the region occupied by the fluid into a half-plane. In the
limit of a strong electric field, when the gravitational and capillary forces
are negligibly small, there exists an exact analytical solution of the
electro-hydrodynamic equations describing propagation without distortions of
nonlinear surface waves along (or against) the electric field direction. In the
situation where gravity and capillarity are taken into account, the results of
numerical simulations indeed show that, for large external field, the waves
traveling in a given direction tend to preserve their shape. In the limit of a
strong electric field, the interaction of counter-propagating waves leads to
the formation of regions, where the electrostatic and dynamic pressures undergo
a discontinuity, and the curvature of the surface increases infinitely. The
Fourier spectrum of the surface perturbations tends to the power-law
distribution (k^-2). In the case of a finite electric field, the wave
interaction results in a radiation of massive cascade of small-scale capillary
waves that causes the chaotic behavior of the system. The investigated
mechanism of interaction between oppositely-traveling waves can enhance
development of the capillary turbulence of the fluid surface.

the latter being set by imposing three-body angular potentials along chain
backbones. Upon increasing the chain length and bending stiffness, structural
reorganisation leads to volumetric expansion of the material and build-up of
internal stresses. The VDOS has two dominant bands: a low frequency one
corresponding to inter- and intra-chain non-bonding interactions and a high
frequency one corresponding principally to vibrations of bonded beads that
constitute skeletal chain backbones. Upon increasing the steepness of the
angular potential, vibrational modes associated with chain bending gradually
move from the low-frequency to the high-frequency band. This redistribution of
modes is reflected in a reduction of the so-called Boson peak upon increasing
chain stiffness. Remarkably, the finer structure and the peaks of the
high-frequency band, and their variations with stiffness, can, for short
chains, be explained using an analytical solution derived for a model triatomic
molecule. For longer chains, the qualitative evolution of the VDOS with chain
stiffness is similar, although the distinct peaks observed for short chains
become increasingly smoothed-out. Our findings can be used to guide a
systematic approach to interpretation of Brillouin and Raman scattering spectra

Optical Theorem that relates the total extinction cross section (including both
scattering and absorption) to the complex amplitude of the scattered wave. In
an authoritative paper where the possibilities of an experimental verification
of Optical Theorem were discussed, it was pointed out that a proof could hardly
come from an optics experiment. One must agree to this statement if one
receives the scattering intensity from an assembly of particles as a Bragg
reflection from a three dimensional random grating. Accordingly, scattered
waves at any angle then behave as a circular Gaussian process, and phases are
equally distributed in the interval (-{\pi}, +{\pi}), therefore giving no cue
on the behaviour of the wave scattered at exactly zero angle. So a proof of the
Optical Theorem would require of telling apart an incoming wave from its weak
replica, and gauge the phase in between. In my PhD thesis, near field
scattering method is exploited for the determination of this elusive phase of
the scattered wave. Having determined the phase of the scattered wave, the
experimental verification of Optical Theorem can also be attempted. In
addition, the method can generate dynamic scattering data as well; it provides
an elegant and efficient way to filter out stray multiple scattering artefacts

of the blazar S4 0954+65, were triggered by an exceptionally high flux state of
emission in the optical. This blazar has a disputed redshift of z=0.368 or
z$\geqslant$0.45 and an uncertain classification among blazar subclasses. The
exceptional source state described here makes for an excellent opportunity to
understand physical processes in the jet of S4 0954+65 and thus contribute to
its classification. We investigate the multiwavelength (MWL) light curve and
spectral energy distribution (SED) of the S4 0954+65 blazar during an enhanced
state in February 2015 and put it in context with possible emission scenarios.
We collect photometric data in radio, optical, X-ray, and $\gamma$ ray. We
study both the optical polarization and the inner parsec-scale jet behavior
with 43 GHz data. Observations with the MAGIC telescopes led to the first
detection of S4 0954+65 at VHE. Simultaneous data with Fermi-LAT at high energy
$\gamma$ ray\ (HE, 100 MeV < E < 100 GeV) also show a period of increased
activity. Imaging at 43 GHz reveals the emergence of a new feature in the radio
jet in coincidence with the VHE flare. Simultaneous monitoring of the optical
polarization angle reveals a rotation of approximately 100$^\circ$. (...) The
broadband spectrum can be modeled with an emission mechanism commonly invoked
for flat spectrum radio quasars, i.e. inverse Compton scattering on an external
soft photon field from the dust torus, also known as external Compton. The
light curve and SED phenomenology is consistent with an interpretation of a
blob propagating through a helical structured magnetic field and eventually
crossing a standing shock in the jet, a scenario typically applied to flat
spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and low-frequency peaked BL Lac objects (LBL).

simulations in fundamental science to security applications. In some critical
cases, as Bell's tests and cryptography, the random numbers are required to be
both secure (i.e. known only by the legitimate user) and to be provided at an
ultra-fast rate (i.e. larger than Gbit/s). However, practical generators are
usually considered trusted, but their security can be compromised in case of
imperfections or malicious external actions. In this work we introduce an
efficient protocol which guarantees security and speed in the generation. We
propose a novel source-device-independent protocol based on generic Positive
Operator Valued Measurements and then we specialize the result to heterodyne
measurements. The security of the generated numbers is proven without any
assumption on the source, which can be even fully controlled by an adversary.
Furthermore, we experimentally implemented the protocol by exploiting
heterodyne measurements, reaching an unprecedented secure generation rate of
17.42 Gbit/s, without the need to take into account finite-size effects. Our
device combines simplicity, ultrafast-rates and high security with low cost
components, paving the way to new practical solutions for random number
generation.

describes important biological phenomena such as the motility of many species'
sperm, bacteria, algae and protozoa. Numerical computations can be challenging,
particularly in three dimensions, due to the presence of moving boundaries and
complex geometries; methods which combine ease-of-implementation and
computational efficiency are therefore needed. A recently-proposed method to
discretise the regularised Stokeslet boundary integral equation without the
need for a connected 'mesh' is applied to the inertialess locomotion problem in
Stokes flow. The mathematical formulation and key aspects of the computational
implementation in MATLAB/GNU Octave are described, followed by numerical
experiments with biflagellate algae and multiple uniflagellate sperm swimming
between no-slip surfaces, for which both swimming trajectories and flow fields
are calculated. These computational experiments required minutes of time on
modest hardware; an extensible implementation is provided in a github
repository. The nearest neighbour discretisation dramatically improves
convergence and robustness, a key challenge in extending the regularised
Stokeslet method to complicated, three dimensional, biological fluid problems.

of energy from injection to dissipation scales, where the energy is converted
to heat. Here we consider a simple system consisting of a magnetized plasma
slab of electrons and a single ion species with a cross-field density gradient.
We show that such a system is subject to an electron drift wave instability,
known as the universal instability, which is stabilized only when the electron
and ion thermal speeds are equal. For unequal thermal speeds, we find that the
instability gives rise to turbulent energy exchange between ions and electrons
that acts to equalize the thermal speeds. Consequently, this turbulent heating
tends to equalize the component temperatures of pair plasmas and to heat ions
to much higher temperatures than electrons for conventional mass-ratio plasmas.

great extent on acoustic liners that consists of a cavity and a perforated face
sheet. The prediction of the impedance of the liners by direct numerical
simulations is nowadays not feasible due to the hundreds to thousands
repetitions of tiny holes. We introduce a procedure to numerically obtain the
Rayleigh conductivity for acoustic liners for viscous gases at rest, and with
it define the acoustic impedance of the perforated sheet.
  Results: The proposed method decouples the effects that are dominant on
different scales: (a) viscous and incompressible flow at the scale of one hole,
(b) inviscid and incompressible flow at the scale of the hole pattern, and (c)
inviscid and compressible flow at the scale of the wave-length. With the method
of matched asymptotic expansions we couple the different scales and eventually
obtain effective impedance conditions on the macroscopic scale. For this the
effective Rayleigh conductivity results by numerical solution of an
instationary Stokes problem in frequency domain around one hole with prescribed
pressure at infinite distance to the aperture. It depends on hole shape,
frequency, mean density and viscosity divided by the area of the periodicity
cell. This enables us to estimate dissipation losses and transmission
properties, that we compare with acoustic measurements in a duct acoustic test
rig with a circular cross-section by DLR Berlin.
  Conclusions: A precise and reasonable definition of an effective Rayleigh
conductivity at the scale of one hole is proposed and impedance conditions for
the macroscopic pressure or velocity are derived in a systematic procedure. The
comparison with experiments shows that the derived impedance conditions give a
good prediction of the dissipation losses.

of the top priorities for the VLTI. As of today, the VLTI routinely achieves
contrasts of a few 10$^{-3}$ in the near-infrared with PIONIER (H band) and
GRAVITY (K band). Nulling interferometers in the northern hemisphere and
non-redundant aperture masking experiments have, however, demonstrated that
contrasts of at least a few 10$^{-4}$ are within reach using specific beam
combination and data acquisition techniques. In this paper, we explore the
possibility to reach similar or higher contrasts on the VLTI. After reviewing
the state-of-the-art in high-contrast infrared interferometry, we discuss key
features that made the success of other high-contrast interferometric
instruments (e.g., integrated optics, nulling, closure phase, and statistical
data reduction) and address possible avenues to improve the contrast of the
VLTI by at least one order of magnitude. In particular, we discuss the
possibility to use integrated optics, proven in the near-infrared, in the
thermal near-infrared (L and M bands, 3-5 $\mu$m), a sweet spot to image and
characterize young extra-solar planetary systems. Finally, we address the
science cases of a high-contrast VLTI imaging instrument and focus particularly
on exoplanet science (young exoplanets, planet formation, and exozodiacal
disks), stellar physics (fundamental parameters and multiplicity), and
extragalactic astrophysics (active galactic nuclei and fundamental constants).
Synergies and scientific preparation for other potential future instruments
such as the Planet Formation Imager are also briefly discussed.

major goals of modern astronomy. One way to make progress towards these goals
is to obtain high-quality spectra of a large number of exoplanets over a broad
range of wavelengths. While concepts currently investigated in the United
States are focused on visible/NIR wavelengths, where the planets are probed in
reflected light, a compelling alternative to characterize planetary atmospheres
is the mid-infrared waveband (5-20~$\mu$m). Indeed, mid-infrared observations
provide key information on the presence of an atmosphere, the surface
conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, habitability), and the atmospheric
composition in important species such as H$_2$O, CO$_2$, O$_3$, CH$_4$, and
N$_2$O. This information is essential to investigate the potential habitability
of exoplanets and to make progress towards the search for life in the universe.
Obtaining high-quality mid-infrared spectra of exoplanets from the ground is
however extremely challenging due to the overwhelming brightness and turbulence
of Earth's atmosphere. In this paper, we present a concept of space-based
mid-infrared interferometer that can tackle this observing challenge and
discuss the main technological developments required to launch such a
sophisticated instrument.

with a competitive precision from observing a multiply imaged quasar. The
success of this technique relies upon a robust modeling of the lens mass
distribution. Unfortunately strong degeneracies between density profiles that
lead to almost the same lensing observables may bias precise estimate for the
Hubble constant. The source position transformation (SPT), which covers the
well-known mass sheet transformation (MST) as a special case, defines a new
framework to investigate these degeneracies. In this paper, we present pySPT, a
Python package dedicated to the SPT. We describe how it can be used to evaluate
the impact of the SPT on lensing observables. We review most of its
capabilities and elaborate on key features that we used in a companion paper
regarding SPT and time delays. pySPT also comes with a sub-package dedicated to
simple lens modeling. It can be used to generate lensing related quantities for
a wide variety of lens models, independently from any SPT analysis. As a first
practical application, we present a correction to the first estimate of the
impact on time delays of the SPT, which has been experimentally found in
Schneider and Sluse (2013) between a softened power-law and a composite
(baryons + dark matter) lenses. We find that the large deviations predicted in
Schneider and Sluse (2014) have been overestimated due to a minor bug (now
fixed) in the public lens modeling code lensmodel (v1.99). We conclude that the
predictions for the Hubble constant deviate by $\sim 7$\%, first and foremost
caused by an MST. The latest version of pySPT is available at
https://github.com/owertz/pySPT. We also provide tutorials to describe in
detail how making the best use of pySPT at

better than 2% is required in order to understand the nature of dark energy.
However, the two most accurate methods to do it, the cosmic microwave
background and the distance scale ladder are inconsistent today, which is
refereed as the ""tension"". One of the key to resolve this tension is related to
the calibration of the period-luminosity (PL) of Cepheids : what is its
zero-point ? Is it metallicity dependent ? Can we reduce the dispersion of the
PL relation ? The eclipsing binaries method was recently used to determine the
distance to LMC with a 2.2% accuracy, which is crucial to constrain the
zero-point of the PL relation and to study the impact of metallicity. However,
this method is based on the hypothesis that stars are perfect blackbody, which
is not always the case as shown by inconsistencies in the surface brightness -
color relations of early type stars for instance, that are actually useful for
the distance determination of eclipsing binaries in distant galaxies (i.e. M31,
M33). On the other hand, it is now possible to apply the Baade-Wesselink method
to Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds, however the value of the projection
factor and its dependence with the period of Cepheids remains a key issue.
Understanding the dynamical structure of the atmosphere of Cepheids (p-factor,
k-factor) and their environment cannot be circumvented in order to determine
the distance in the universe. This is even more true that the environment of
Cepheids could increase the dispersion of the PL relation. The next generation
of interferometers (MATISSE, SPICA), the Gaia parallaxes, in the context of
JWST, PLATO, and ELT will help to resolve these fundamental issues.

using a Fokker-Planck approach with a focus on the linear response and
time-correlation functions. In particular, we compare different methods to
compute these functions including the unified colored noise approximation
(UCNA). The AOUP model, described by the position of the particle and the
active force acting on it, is usually mapped into a Markovian process,
describing the motion of a fictitious passive particle in terms of its position
and velocity, where the effect of the activity is transferred into a
position-dependent friction. We show that the form of the response function of
the AOUP depends on whether we put the perturbation on the position and keep
unperturbed the active force in the original variables or perturb the position
and maintain unperturbed the velocity in the transformed variables. Indeed, as
a result of the change of variables the perturbation on the position becomes a
perturbation both on the position and on the fictitious velocity. We test these
predictions by considering the response for three types of convex potentials:
quadratic, quartic and double-well potential. Moreover, by comparing the
response of the AOUP model with the corresponding response of the UCNA model we
conclude that although the stationary properties are fairly well approximated
by the UCNA, the non equilibrium properties are not, an effect which is not
negligible when the persistence time is large.

covering the disk of M~33 is explored in detail.The clouds were found using
CPROPS and were subsequently catalogued in terms of their star-forming
properties as non-star-forming (A), with embedded star formation (B), or with
exposed star formation C.We find that the size-linewidth relation among the
M~33 clouds is quite weak but, when comparing with clouds in other nearby
galaxies, the linewidth scales with average metallicity.The linewidth and
particularly the line brightness decrease with galactocentric distance.The
large number of clouds makes it possible to calculate well-sampled cloud mass
spectra and mass spectra of subsamples.As noted earlier, but considerably
better defined here, the mass spectrum steepens (i.e. higher fraction of small
clouds) with galactocentric distance.A new finding is that the mass spectrum of
A clouds is much steeper than that of the star-forming clouds.Further dividing
the sample, this difference is strong at both large and small galactocentric
distances and the A vs C difference is a stronger effect than the inner/outer
disk difference in mass spectra.Velocity gradients are identified in the clouds
using standard techniques.The gradients are weak and are dominated by prograde
rotation; the effect is stronger for the high signal-to-noise clouds.A
discussion of the uncertainties is presented.The angular momenta are low but
compatible with at least some simulations.The cloud and galactic gradients are
similar; the cloud rotation periods are much longer than cloud lifetimes and
comparable to the galactic rotation period.The rotational kinetic energy is
1-2\% of the gravitational potential energy and the cloud edge velocity is well
below the escape velocity, such that cloud-scale rotation probably has little
influence on the evolution of molecular clouds.

constitutes an $O(\delta)$ perturbation, where $\delta$ is the boundary-layer

the wavelength and the minimum radius of curvature of the wall is much larger

assess the model in the case of sound propagation through a compression driver,

the presence of shallow chambers and thin slits in the device, it is crucial to
include modeling of visco-thermal losses in the acoustic analysis. The

by direct coupling analysis (DCA), have recently gained popularity in
particular due to their capacity to accurately predict residue-residue contacts
from sequence information alone, and thereby to facilitate tertiary and
quaternary protein structure prediction. More recently, they have also been
used to predict fitness effects of amino-acid substitutions in proteins, and to
predict evolutionary conserved protein-protein interactions. These models are
based on two currently unjustified hypotheses: (a) correlations in the
amino-acid usage of different positions are resulting collectively from
networks of direct couplings; and (b) pairwise couplings are sufficient to
capture the amino-acid variability. Here we propose a highly precise inference
scheme based on Boltzmann-machine learning, which allows us to systematically
address these hypotheses. We show how correlations are built up in a highly
collective way by a large number of coupling paths, which are based on the
protein's three-dimensional structure. We further find that pairwise
coevolutionary models capture the collective residue variability across
homologous proteins even for quantities which are not imposed by the inference
procedure, like three-residue correlations, the clustered structure of protein
families in sequence space or the sequence distances between homologs. These
findings strongly suggest that pairwise coevolutionary models are actually
sufficient to accurately capture the residue variability in homologous protein
families.

thus leads to three-dimensional electron flux in metallic materials.
Temperature gradients in combination with material magnetization generate
thermomagnetic voltages. The interplay between these direction-dependent
temperature gradients and the magnetization along with their control enable to
manipulate the generated voltages, e.g. in magnetic nanodevices. We identify
the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) generated on a nanometer length scale by
micrometer sized temperature gradients in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). In
a systematic study, we extract the ANE by analyzing the influence of in-plane
temperature gradients on the tunnel magneto-Seebeck effect (TMS) in three
dimensional devices. To investigate these effects, we utilize in-plane
magnetized MTJs based on CoFeB electrodes with an MgO tunnel barrier. Due to
our measurement configuration, there is no necessity to disentangle the ANE
from the spin Seebeck effect in inverse spin-Hall measurements. The temperature
gradients are created by a tightly focused laser spot. The spatial extent of
the measured effects is defined by the MTJ size, while the spatial resolution
is given by the laser spot size and the step size of its lateral translation.
This method is highly sensitive to low voltages and yields an ANE coefficient
of $K_N\approx 1.6\cdot 10^{-8}\,\mathrm{V/TK}$ for CoFeB. In general, TMS
investigations in MTJs are motivated by the usage of otherwise wasted heat in
magnetic memory devices for read/write operations. Here, the additionally
generated ANE effect allows to expand the MTJs' functionality from simple
memory storage to nonvolatile logic devices and opens new application fields
such as direction dependent temperature sensing with the potential for further
downscaling.

test facility by using a gas-filled capillary plasma source composed of a
dielectric capillary. The electron can reach GeV energy in a few centimeters,
with an accelerating gradient orders of magnitude larger than provided by
conventional techniques. In this acceleration scheme, wake fields produced by
passing electron beams through dielectric structures can determine a strong
beam instability that represents an important hurdle towards the capability to
focus high-current electron beams in the transverse plane. For these reasons,
the estimation of the transverse wakefield amplitudes assumes a fundamental
role in the implementation of the plasma wake-field acceleration. In this work,
it presented a study to investigate which parameters affect the wake-field
formation inside a cylindrical dielectric structure, both the capillary
dimensions and the beam parameters, and it is introduced a quantitative
evaluation of the longitudinal and transverse electric fields.

  Missing Data",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a simple and efficient estimation procedure for the model
with non-ignorable missing data studied by Morikawa and Kim (2016). Their
semiparametrically efficient estimator requires explicit nonparametric
estimation and so suffers from the curse of dimensionality and requires a
bandwidth selection. We propose an estimation method based on the Generalized
Method of Moments (hereafter GMM). Our method is consistent and asymptotically
normal regardless of the number of moments chosen. Furthermore, if the number
of moments increases appropriately our estimator can achieve the semiparametric
efficiency bound derived in Morikawa and Kim (2016), but under weaker
regularity conditions. Moreover, our proposed estimator and its consistent
covariance matrix are easily computed with the widely available GMM package. We
propose two data-based methods for selection of the number of moments. A small
scale simulation study reveals that the proposed estimation indeed out-performs
the existing alternatives in finite samples.

onboard the PROBA-3 mission of ESA. The external occulter (EO) will be placed
on one satellite ~150 m ahead of the second satellite with an optical
instrument. During part of each orbit, the satellites will fly in a precise
formation, constituting a giant externally occulted coronagraph. Large distance
between the EO and the primary objective will allow observations of the
white-light solar corona starting already from ~1.1RSun. We analyze influence
of shifts of the satellites and misalignments of optical elements on diffracted
light. Based on the quantitative influence of misalignments on diffracted
light, we will provide a ""recipe"" for choosing the size of the internal
occulter (IO) to achieve a trade-off between the minimal height of observations
and sustainability to possible misalignments. We implement a numerical model of
the diffracted light and its propagation through the optical system, and
compute intensities of diffracted light throughout the instrument. Our
numerical model extends axi-symmetrical model of Rougeot et al. 2017 to
non-symmetrical cases. The computations fully confirm main properties of the
diffracted light obtained from semi-analytical consideration. Results: relative
influences of various misalignments are significantly different. We show that:
the IO with R=1.1RSun is large enough to compensate possible misalignments in
ASPIICS, apodizing the edge of the IO leads to additional suppression of the
diffracted light. Conclusions: the most important misalignment is the tilt of
the telescope WRT the line connecting the center of the EO and the entrance
aperture. Special care should be taken to co-align the EO and the coronagraph,
i.e. co-aligning the diffraction fringe from the EO and the IO. We suggest that
the best orientation strategy is to point the coronagraph to the center of the
EO.

Minkowski conformal blocks. Starting with a t-channel OPE, it leads to an
expansion for an s-channel scattering amplitude in terms of t-channel
exchanges. By contrasting with Euclidean conformal blocks we see a precise
relationship between conformal blocks in the two limits without preforming an
explicit analytic continuation. We discuss a generic feature for a CFT
correlation function having singular $F^{(M)}(u,v)\sim {u}^{-\delta}\,$,
$\delta>0$, in the limit $u \rightarrow 0$ and $v\rightarrow 1$. Here,
$\delta=(\ell_{eff}-1)/2$, with $\ell_{eff}$ serving as an effective spin and
it can be determined through an OPE. In particular, it is bounded from above,
$\ell_{eff} \leq 2$, for all CFTs with a gravity dual, and it can be associated
with string modes interpolating the graviton in AdS. This singularity is
historically referred to as the Pomeron. This bound is nearly saturated by
SYK-like effective $d=1$ CFT, and its stringy and thermal corrections have
piqued current interests. Our analysis has been facilitated by dealing with
Wightman functions. We provide a direct treatment in diagonalizing dynamical
equations via harmonic analysis over physical scattering regions. As an example
these methods are applied to the SYK model.

programmability and low cost. However, they suffer from cosmic
radiation-induced Single Event Upsets (SEUs). Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR)
is a well-known technique to mitigate SEUs in FPGAs that is often used with
another SEU mitigation technique known as configuration scrubbing. Traditional
TMR provides protection against a single fault at a time, while partitioned TMR
provides improved reliability and availability. In this paper, we present a
methodology to analyze TMR partitioning at early design stage using
probabilistic model checking. The proposed formal model can capture both single
and multiple-cell upset scenarios, regardless of any assumption of equal
partition sizes. Starting with a high-level description of a design, a Markov
model is constructed from the Data Flow Graph (DFG) using a specified number of
partitions, a component characterization library and a user defined scrub rate.
Such a model and exhaustive analysis captures all the considered failures and
repairs possible in the system within the radiation environment. Various
reliability and availability properties are then verified automatically using
the PRISM model checker exploring the relationship between the scrub frequency

I discuss the plausibility and reasonability of their hypotheses, the
applicability and implications of the theorems, as well as the theorems
themselves. The consequences usually extracted from them, some of them without
the necessary rigour, are widely and carefully analysed with many clarifying
examples and alternative views.

axiomatic systems for thermodynamics, supports the construction of conserved

entropy exhibits both information and thermodynamic aspects. Although our
axioms are not based upon probabilistic concepts, a natural and highly useful
concept of probability emerges from the entropy function itself. Our abstract

zero external pressure and temperature. Utilizing the MIT bag model description
of magnetized SQM under charge neutrality and beta equilibrium conditions, the

extraction stage, we propose to augment spatio-temporal cubes with deep
appearance features extracted from the last convolutional layer of a

from the training video containing only normal events, we apply k-means
clustering to find clusters representing different types of normal motion and
appearance features. In the first stage, we consider that clusters with fewer
samples (with respect to a given threshold) contain mostly outliers, and we
eliminate these clusters altogether. In the second stage, we shrink the borders
of the remaining clusters by training a one-class SVM model on each cluster. To
detected abnormal events in the test video, we analyze each test sample and
consider its maximum normality score provided by the trained one-class SVM
models, based on the intuition that a test sample can belong to only one
cluster of normality. If the test sample does not fit well in any narrowed
normality cluster, then it is labeled as abnormal. We compare our method with
several state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark data sets. The empirical
results indicate that our abnormal event detection framework can achieve better
results in most cases, while processing the test video in real-time at 24

mutations, is one of the central concepts in evolution. In recent years a large
body of work has focused on the origins, mechanisms, and consequences of
robustness in a wide range of biological systems. In particular, research on
ncRNAs studied the ability of sequences to maintain folded structures against
single-point mutations. In these studies, the structure is merely a reference.
However, recent work revealed evidence that structure itself contributes to the
genetic robustness of ncRNAs. We follow this line of thought and consider
sequence-structure pairs as the unit of evolution and introduce the spectrum of
inverse folding rates (IFR-spectrum) as a measurement of genetic robustness.
Our analysis of the miRNA let-7 family captures key features of

compressing data points in a trajectory to a set of continuous line segments.

  Radio Systems with Statistical Interference Constraints","GC 2013",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we adopt a multiobjective optimization approach to jointly
optimize the rate and power in OFDM-based cognitive radio (CR) systems. We
propose a novel algorithm that jointly maximizes the OFDM-based CR system
throughput and minimizes its transmit power, while guaranteeing a target bit
error rate per subcarrier and a total transmit power threshold for the
secondary user (SU), and restricting both co-channel and adjacent channel
interferences to existing primary users (PUs) in a statistical manner. Since
the interference constraints are met statistically, the SU transmitter does not
require perfect channel-state-information (CSI) feedback from the PUs
receivers. Closed-form expressions are derived for bit and power allocations
per subcarrier. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the proposed
algorithm and compare it to the case of perfect CSI. Further, the results show
that the performance of the proposed algorithm approaches that of an exhaustive
search for the discrete global optimal allocations with significantly reduced
computational complexity.

better understanding of Frobenius lifts and their connection with p-derivations
in the sense of Buium \cite{Buium-Main}. In this way ""numbers {\em are}

structure deformation problems as arithmetic differential equations as in
\cite{Buium-Manin}, and providing a cohomological interpretation to Buium
calculus via Hochschild cohomology which controls deformations of algebraic
structures.
  Applications to p-adic periods are considered, including to the classical
Euler gamma and beta functions and their p-adic analogues, from a cohomological
point of view.
  Connections between various methods for computing scattering amplitudes are
related to the moduli space problem and period domains.

that: Given three points in R^2 and a positive real number (weight) which
correspond to each point , find the point (weighted Fermat-Torricelli point)
such that the sum of the weighted distances to these three points is minimized.
By applying the mechanical device of Pick and Polya the oscillatory tree

given isosceles triangle with corresponding two equal weights at the vertices
of the base segment. it is worth mentioning that after time t the oscillatory
knot of the mechanical system passes from the weighted Fermat-Torricelli point

Here, we present a new concept of rational choice as a hyper-rational choice
which in this concept, the actor thinks about profit or loss of other actors in
addition to his personal profit or loss and then will choose an action which is
desirable to him. We implement the hyper-rational choice to generalize and
expand the game theory. Results of this study will help to model the behavior
