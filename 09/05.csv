Perkins, Oklahoma (35.97, -97.04) at 2013 UTC. Two infrasound microphones with
a 59-m separation and a regional Doppler radar station were located 18.7 km and
70 km from the tornado, respectively. Elevated infrasound levels were observed
starting 7 minutes before the verified tornado. Infrasound data below ~5 Hz was
contaminated with wind noise, but in the 5-50 Hz band the infrasound was
independent of wind speed with a bearing angle that was consistent with the
movement of the storm core that produced the tornado. During the tornado, a 75
dB peak formed at ~8.3 Hz, which was 18 dB above pre-tornado levels. This
fundamental frequency had overtones (18, 29, 36, and 44 Hz) that were linearly
related to mode number. Analysis of a larger period of time associated with two
infrasound bursts (the tornado occurred during the first event) shows that the
spectral peaks from the tornado were present from 4 minutes before to 40
minutes after tornadogenesis. This suggests that the same geophysical
process(es) was active during this entire window.

in [1]. The model identification problem for asymptotically stable linear time
invariant systems is considered. The system output is affected by an additive
noise with unknown bound, and a finite set of data is available for parameter
estimation. The goal is to derive a model with guaranteed simulation error
bounds for all predicted time steps, up to a finite horizon of choice. This is
achieved in three steps. At first, the noise bound, system order, and impulse
response decay rate are estimated from data. Then, the estimated quantities are
used to refine the sets of all possible multi-step predictors compatible with
data and prior assumptions (Feasible Parameter Sets, FPSs). The FPSs allow one
to derive, in a Set Membership framework, guaranteed error bounds for any given
multi-step predictor, including the one obtained by simulating the system
model. Finally, the wanted model parameters are identified by numerical
optimization, imposing the constraints provided by the FPSs and using one of
two proposed optimality criteria, namely to minimize the worst-case error bound
over the considered simulation horizon, or to minimize a standard simulation
error criterion. Numerical simulations illustrate the validity of the approach.

novel data-driven approach dubbed JobComposer to automate career path planning

maximize the sum of payoffs attainable by following a career path. At its
heart, JobComposer features a decomposition-based multicriteria utility
learning procedure to achieve the best tradeoff among different payoff criteria

dielectric environment above, below, and between the two TMD layers as well as
polarization effects in the transition metal layer and in the chalcogen layers
of the TMD layers. We calculate the interlayer exciton binding energy and
average in-plane interparticle distance for different TMD heterostructures. The
effect of different dielectric environments on the exciton binding energy is
investigated and a remarkable dependence on the dielectric constant of the
barrier between the two layers is found, resulting from competing effects as a
function of the in-plane and out-of-plane dielectric constants of the barrier.
The polarization effects in the chalcogen layers, which in general reduce the
exciton binding energy, can lead to an increase in binding energy in the
presence of strong substrate effects by screening the substrate. The excitonic
absorbance spectrum is calculated and we show that the interlayer exciton peak
depends linearly on a perpendicular electric field, which agrees with recent

connect a massive amount of high capacity small cells (SCs) to the network.
Because having an optical connection to each SC might be infeasible,
mmWave-based (e.g. 60 GHz) BH links are an interesting alternative due to their
large available bandwidth. To cope with the increased path loss, mmWave links
require directional antennas that should be able to direct their beams to
different neighbors, to dynamically change the BH topology, in case new nodes
are powered on/off or the traffic demand has changed. Such BH adaptation needs
to be orchestrated to minimize the impact on existing traffic. This paper
develops a Software-defined networking-based framework that guides the optimal
reconfiguration of mesh BH networks composed by mmWave links, where antennas
need to be mechanically aligned. By modelling the problem as a Mixed Integer
Linear Program (MILP), its solution returns the optimal ordering of events
necessary to transition between two BH network configurations. The model
creates backup paths whenever it is possible, while minimizing the packet loss
of ongoing flows. A numerical evaluation with different topologies and traffic
demands shows that increasing the number of BH interfaces per SC from 2 to 4
can decrease the total loss by more than 50%. Moreover, when increasing the
total reconfiguration time, additional backup paths can be created,
consequently reducing the reconfiguration impact on existing traffic.

symmetric coupling leads to ferro- and antiferromagnetism, antisymmetric
coupling has attracted significant interest owing to its major role in
promoting topologically non-trivial spin textures that promise high-speed and
energy-efficient devices. So far, the antisymmetric exchange coupling rather
short-ranged and limited to a single magnetic layer has been demonstrated,
while the symmetric coupling also leads to long-range interlayer exchange
coupling. Here, we report the missing component of the long-range antisymmetric
interlayer exchange coupling in perpendicularly magnetized synthetic
antiferromagnets with parallel and antiparallel magnetization alignments.
Asymmetric hysteresis loops under an in-plane field unambiguously reveal a
unidirectional and chiral nature of this novel interaction, which cannot be
accounted for by existing coupling mechanisms, resulting in canted
magnetization alignments. This can be explained by spin-orbit coupling combined
with reduced symmetry in multilayers. This new class of chiral interaction
provides an additional degree of freedom for engineering magnetic structures
and promises to enable a new class of three-dimensional topological structures.

Myr-old Upper Sco region, in polarized scattered light with VLT/SPHERE at
near-infrared wavelengths, reaching an angular resolution of ~0.037"" (~6 au).
We obtained two datasets, one with a 145 mas diameter coronagraph, and the
other without, enabling us to probe the disk structure down to an angular
separation of ~0.06"" (~10 au). In our observations, the disk of HD 143006 is
clearly resolved up to ~0.5"" and shows a clear large-scale asymmetry with the
eastern side brighter than the western side. We detect a number of additional
features, including two gaps and a ring. The ring shows an overbrightness at a
position angle (PA) of ~140 deg, extending over a range in position angle of
~60 deg, and two narrow dark regions. The two narrow dark lanes and the overall
large-scale asymmetry are indicative of shadowing effects, likely due to a
misaligned inner disk. We demonstrate the remarkable resemblance between the
scattered light image of HD 143006 and a model prediction of a warped disk due
to an inclined binary companion. The warped disk model, based on the
hydrodynamic simulations combined with 3D radiative transfer calculations,
reproduces all major morphological features. However, it does not account for
the observed overbrightness at PA~140 deg. Shadows have been detected in
several protoplanetary disks, suggesting that misalignment in disks is not
uncommon. However, the origin of the misalignment is not clear.
As-yet-undetected stellar or massive planetary companions could be responsible
for them, and naturally account for the presence of depleted inner cavities.

identifying transitive aligned vertices between graphs, and transforms
arbitrary sized graphs into fixed-sized aligned vertex grid structures. In
order to learn representative graph characteristics, a new quantum spatial
graph convolution is proposed and employed to extract multi-scale vertex
features, in terms of quantum information propagation between grid vertices of
each graph. Since the quantum spatial convolution preserves the grid structures
of the input vertices (i.e., the convolution layer does not change the original

employ the traditional convolutional neural network architecture to further
learn from the global graph topology, providing an end-to-end deep learning
architecture that integrates the graph representation and learning in the
quantum spatial graph convolution layer and the traditional convolutional layer
for graph classifications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed

We aim to use new Chandra observations of 30 Dor C to resolve the synchrotron
shell in unprecedented detail and to estimate the magnetic ($B$) field in the
postshock region, a key discriminator between TeV $\gamma$-ray emission
mechanisms. We extracted radial profiles in the 1.5-8 keV range from various
sectors around the synchrotron shell and fitted these with a projected and
point spread function convolved postshock volumetric emissivity model to
determine the filament widths. We then calculated the postshock magnetic field
strength from these widths. We found that most of the sectors were well fitted
with our postshock model and the determined $B$-field values were low, all with
best fits $\lesssim 20~\mu$G. Upper limits on the confidence intervals of three
sectors reached $\gtrsim 30~\mu$G though these were poorly constrained. The
generally low $B$-field values suggests a leptonic-dominated origin for the TeV
$\gamma$-rays. Our postshock model did not provide adequate fits to two
sectors. We found that one sector simply did not provide a clean enough radial
profile, while the other could be fitted with a modified model where the
projected profile falls off abruptly below $\sim0.8$ times the shell radius,
yielding a postshock $B$-field of 4.8 (3.7-11.8) $\mu$G which is again
consistent with the leptonic TeV $\gamma$-ray mechanism. Alternatively, the
observed profiles in these sectors could result from enhancements around a
shock-cloud interaction as suggested in previous works. The average $B$-field
determined around the X-ray synchrotron shell of 30 Dor C suggests the leptonic
scenario as the dominant emission mechanism for the TeV $\gamma$-rays.

these frequencies to compensate for high isotropic pathloss. This reliance on
di- rectional beamforming, however, makes the cell discovery (cell search)
challenging since both base station (gNB) and user equipment (UE) jointly
perform a search over angular space to locate potential beams to initiate
communication. In the cell discovery phase, sequential beam sweeping is
performed through the angular coverage region in order to transmit
synchronization signals. The sweeping pattern can either be a linear rotation
or a hopping pattern that makes use of additional information. This paper
proposes beam sweeping pattern prediction, based on the dynamic distribution of
user traffic, using a form of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) called Gated
Recurrent Unit (GRU). The spatial distribution of users is inferred from data
in call detail records (CDRs) of the cellular network. Results show that the

and magnetic and kinetic energy densities from our numerical model of the
interstellar medium, based on three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equations
in a shearing box $1 \times 1 \times 2 \, {\rm kpc}$ in size. The interstellar
medium is highly compressible, as the turbulence is transonic or supersonic; it
is thus an excellent context in which to explore the use of smoothing to
represent physical variables in a compressible medium in terms of their mean
and fluctuating parts. Unlike alternative averaging procedures, such as
horizontal averaging, Gaussian smoothing retains the three-dimensional
structure of the mean fields. Although Gaussian smoothing does not obey the
Reynolds rules of averaging, physically meaningful and mathematically sound
central statistical moments are defined as suggested by Germano (1992). We
discuss methods to identify an optimal smoothing scale $\ell$ and the effects
of this choice on the results. From spectral analysis of the magnetic, density
and velocity fields, we find a suitable smoothing length for all three fields,
of $\ell \approx 75 \, {\rm pc}$. Such a smoothing scale is likely to be
sensitive to the choice of simulation parameters; this may be considered in
future work, but here we just explore the methodology. We discuss the
properties of third-order statistical moments in fluctuations of kinetic energy
density in compressible flows, and suggest their physical interpretation. The
mean magnetic field, amplified by a mean-field dynamo, significantly alters the
distribution of kinetic energy in space and between scales, reducing the
magnitude of kinetic energy at intermediate scales. This intermediate-scale
kinetic energy is a useful diagnostic of the importance of SN-driven outflows.

liquid form a gas that can move as a whole with respect to the center of mass
of the system. This internal motion attenuates at exponentially long time
scales. As a result, in a broad range of frequencies the liquid is described by
two-fluid hydrodynamics, and the system supports two sound modes. The physical
nature of the two sounds depends on whether the particles forming the quantum
liquid have a spin degree of freedom. For particles with spin, the modes are
analogous to the first and second sound modes in superfluid $^4$He, which are
the waves of density and entropy, respectively. When dissipative processes are
taken into account, we find that at low frequencies the second sound is
transformed into heat diffusion, while the first sound mode remains weakly
damped and becomes the ordinary sound. In a spinless liquid the entropy and
density oscillations are strongly coupled, and the resulting sound modes are
hybrids of the first and second sound. As the frequency is lowered and
dissipation processes become important, the crossover to single-fluid regime
occurs in two steps. First the hybrid modes transform into predominantly
density and entropy waves, similar to the first and second sound, and then the
density wave transforms to the ordinary sound and the entropy wave becomes a
heat diffusion mode. Finally, we account for the dissipation due to viscosity
and intrinsic thermal conductivity of the gas of excitations, which controls
attenuation of the sound modes at high frequencies.

decouple and solution modes approach pairs of light and acoustic waves as well
as a number of purely damped (non-propagating) modes. In the opposite (ideal)

with a pair of fast magnetosonic, a pair of slow and Alfv\'en modes, as
expected. In addition, the contact mode is always present and it is unaffected
by the conductivity. For finite values of the conductivity, the dispersion
relation gives rise to either pairs of opposite complex conjugate roots or
purely imaginary (damped) modes. In all cases, the system is dissipative and
also dispersive as the phase velocity depends nonlineary on the wavenumber.

obtained from the Gaia, UCAC4, and LBA data. We also determined the distance to
1FGL J1018.6-5856 to be $6.4_{-0.7}^{+ 1.7}$ kpc. Together with the radial
velocity of the source we computed its three-dimensional proper and peculiar
motion within the Galaxy. We obtained a peculiar motion on its regional
standard of rest (RSR) frame of $|u| = 45_{-9}^{+30}$ km s$^{-1}$, with the
system moving away from the Galactic plane. In the simplest scenario of a
symmetric stellar core collapse we estimate a mass loss of $ 4 \lesssim \Delta

J1018.6-5856 exhibits compact radio emission similar to that detected in other

\textsc{HMcode}. We construct mock tomographic shear power spectra from four
hydrodynamical simulations, and run simulated likelihood analyses with
\textsc{CosmoLike} assuming LSST-like survey statistics. With an angular scale
cut of $\ell_{\rm max}<2000$, both methods successfully remove the biases in
cosmological parameters due to the various baryonic physics scenarios, with the
PCA method causing less degradation in the parameter constraints than
\textsc{HMcode}. For a more aggressive $\ell_{\rm max}=$5000, the PCA method
performs well for all but one baryonic physics scenario, requiring additional
training simulations to account for the extreme baryonic physics scenario of
Illustris; \textsc{HMcode} exhibits tensions in the 2D posterior distributions
of cosmological parameters due to lack of freedom in describing the power
spectrum for $k > 10\ h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. We investigate variants of the PCA
method and improve the bias mitigation through PCA by accounting for the noise
properties in the data via Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix. Our
improved PCA method allows us to retain more statistical constraining power
while effectively mitigating baryonic uncertainties even for a broad range of
baryonic physics scenarios.

tantalizing preview of the properties expected in the NEAs they produce. So
far, primitive asteroids in the inner belt fall into two spectral groups. The

spun-down to a state of synchronous rotation, including temperate ones. Studies
about the atmospheric and surface processes occurring on such planets thus
assume that the day/night sides are fixed with respect to the surface over
geological timescales. Here we show that this should not be the case for many
synchronous exoplanets. This is due to True Polar Wander (TPW), a well known
process occurring on Earth and in the Solar System that can reorient a planet
without changing the orientation of its rotational angular momentum with
respect to an inertial reference frame. As on Earth, convection in the mantle
of rocky exoplanets should continuously distort their inertia tensor, causing
reorientation. Moreover, we show that this reorientation is made very efficient
by the slower rotation rate of synchronous planets. This is due to the weakness
of their combined rotational/tidal bulge---the main stabilizing factor limiting
TPW. Stabilization by an elastic lithosphere is also shown to be inefficient.
We thus expect the axes of smallest and largest moment of inertia to change
continuously over time but to remain closely aligned with the star-planet and
orbital axes, respectively.

resolve large-scale outflow structure, we extensively expand a simulation box
to cover the space of $3000 r_{\rm S}$ (with $r_{\rm S}$ being the
Schwarzschild radius), larger than those in most previous studies, so that we
can put relatively large angular momentum to the gas injected from the outer
simulation boundary. The adopted Keplerian radius, at which the centrifugal
force balances with the gravitational force, is $r_{\rm K}=300 r_{\rm S}$. The
injected mass first falls and is accumulated at around this radius and then
slowly accretes towards the central black hole via viscosity. We simulate such
accretion processes, taking inverse and bulk Compton scattering into account.
The simulated accretion flow is in a quasi-steady state inside $r_{\rm qss}\sim
200 r_{\rm S}$. Within this radius the flow properties are, as a whole, in good
agreement with those described by the slim disk model except that the radial
density profile of the underlying disk is much flatter, $\rho\propto r^{-0.73}$

scale where baryons are most efficiently converted into stars. This model
assumes that central galaxies are quenched by AGN feedback when hot halo gas
accretes onto a supermassive black hole. Nevertheless, we find that supernova
(SN) feedback sets both mass scales. As haloes grow above a threshold mass, SNe
can no longer eject material so their hot gas content increases, enhancing the
cooling rate onto the central galaxy, its cold gas content, its star formation
rate and the growth rate of its central black hole. Strong AGN feedback
terminates this short-lived phase by suppressing the fuel supply for star
formation. Despite strong evolution of the halo mass - temperature relation,
quenching occurs at a redshift-independent halo and stellar mass which
coincides with the mass where baryons have been converted into stars with
maximal efficiency. These regularities and coincidences are a result of the
specific parameters selected by MCMC tuning of the model to fit the observed
abundance and passive fraction of galaxies over the redshift range 0<z<3. Thus
they are required by the observed evolution of the galaxy population, at least

that the molecular outflow mass is 3-6 times larger than the lower limit

internal structure of high-redshift galaxies. One way to study these clumps in
detail with a higher spatial resolution is by exploiting the power of strong
gravitational lensing which stretches images on the sky. In this work, we
present an analysis of the clumpy galaxy A68-HLS115 at $z=1.5858$, located
behind the cluster Abell 68, but strongly lensed by a cluster galaxy member.
Resolved observations with SINFONI/VLT in the near-infrared show Ha, Hb, [NII],
and [OIII] emission lines. Combined with images covering the B band to the
far-infrared and CO(2-1) observations, this makes this galaxy one of the only
sources for which such multi-band observations are available and for which it
is possible to study the properties of resolved star-forming clumps and to
perform a detailed analysis of the integrated properties, kinematics, and
metallicity. We obtain a stability of $\upsilon_{rot}/\sigma_0 = 2.73$ by
modeling the kinematics, which means that the galaxy is dominated by rotation,
but this ratio also indicates that the disk is marginally stable. We find a
high intrinsic velocity dispersion of $80\pm10$ km s$^{-1}$ that could be
explained by the high gas fraction of $f_{gas}=0.75\pm0.15$ observed in this
galaxy. This high $f_{gas}$ and the observed sSFR of $\rm 3.12 \, Gyr^{-1}$
suggest that the disk turbulence and instabilities are mostly regulated by
incoming gas. The direct measure of the Toomre stability criterion of
$Q_{crit}=0.70$ could also indicate the presence of a quasi-stable thick disk.
Finally, we identify three clumps in the Ha map which have similar velocity
dispersions, metallicities, and seem to be embedded in the rotating disk. These
three clumps contribute together to $40\%$ on the SFR(Ha) of the galaxy and
show a SFR density about $100$ times higher than HII regions in the local
Universe.

recent infall of satellite galaxies from the cluster environment. Previous work
has shown that the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of the stars and globular
clusters in the extended halo of NGC 3311 rises up to the value of the cluster
velocity dispersion. We performed multi-object spectroscopic observations of
the diffuse stellar halo of NGC 3311 using VLT/FORS2 in MXU mode to mimic a
coarse `IFU'. We use pPXF to extract the kinematic information. We find a
homogeneous velocity and velocity dispersion field within r<10 kpc. Beyond this
radius, both the velocities and dispersions start to depend on azimuth angle
and show a significant intrinsic scatter. The inner spheroid of NGC 3311 can be
described as a slow rotator. Outside 10 kpc the cumulative angular momentum is
rising. If the radial dependence alone is considered, the velocity dispersion
does not simply rise but fills an increasingly large range of values with two
well defined envelopes. The lower envelope is about constant at 200 km/s. The
upper envelope rises smoothly, joining the velocity dispersion of the outer
cluster galaxies. We interpret this behaviour as the superposition of tracer
populations with increasingly shallower radial distributions between the
extremes of the inner stellar populations and the cluster galaxies. Simple
Jeans models illustrate that a range of of mass profiles with different
anisotropies can account for all observed velocity dispersions, including
radial MOND models. Jeans models using one tracer population with a unique
density profile are not able to explain the large range of the observed
kinematics. Previous claims about the cored dark halo of NGC 3311 are therefore
probably not valid. This may in general apply to central cluster galaxies with
rising velocity dispersion profiles, where infall processes are important.

in more massive clusters, $M_{\rm cl} \sim 10^{5.7}M_{\odot}$. The clusters
which dominate the production of black hole binaries are similar in age and
metallicity to the entire population. Finally, we estimate an approximate
cosmic black hole merger rate of dynamically assembled binaries using the mean
black hole mass for each cluster given its metallicity. We find an intrinsic
rate of $\sim 6\,\mathrm{Gpc\,yr^{-1}}$ at $z=0$, a weakly increasing merger
rate out to $z=1.5$, and then a decrease out to $z=4$. Our results can be used

winds. For the first time, we demonstrate that the mass fraction probability
distribution functions (PDFs) of individual metal species in the ISM are well
described by a piecewise log-normal and power-law distribution. The PDF
properties vary within each ISM phase. Hot gas is dominated by recent
enrichment, with a significant power-law tail to high metal fractions, while
cold gas is predominately log-normal. In addition, elements dominated by
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) wind enrichment (e.g. N and Ba) mix less
efficiently than elements dominated by supernova enrichment (e.g. $\alpha$
elements and Fe). This result is driven by the differences in source energetics
and source locations, particularly the higher chance compared to massive stars
for AGB stars to eject material into cold gas. Nearly all of the produced
metals are ejected from the galaxy (only 4% are retained), but over 20% of
metals dominated by AGB enrichment are retained. In dwarf galaxies, therefore,
elements synthesized predominately through AGB winds should be both
overabundant and have a larger spread compared to elements synthesized in

submillimetre waveband, with submillimetre surveys tending to select galaxies
on the curve of the Galaxy Sequence, which have the highest ratios of
submillimetre-to-optical luminosity. This effect, working in reverse, causes
galaxies on the curve of the Galaxy Sequence to be underrepresented in optical
samples, deepening the green valley. The green valley is therefore not evidence

  METHODS. We analyse data collected by the Fermi LAT during its first 8.5
years of operation in the energy range 0.1-300 GeV.
  RESULTS. We reveal 23 sources with a test statistic greater than 25
(corresponding to $\sim$ 4.6-$\sigma$) out of 42, with 3 sources not detected
in the 3LAC catalogue, and fluxes between $3.5\times 10^{-10}$ and
$7.4\times10^{-8}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The majority of the sources have hard
spectra ($\Gamma \leq 2$), with only four having values in the range 2.1-2.4.
The three newly detected sources have fluxes in the range between
$0.54\times10^{-9}$ and $1.35\times10^{-9}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, and photon
index 1.7-1.9. Among the 23 LAT-detected sources, 19 are included in the 3FHL,
with a spectrum that connects relatively smoothly from 0.1 GeV to 2 TeV.
LAT-detected BL Lacs are more luminous on parsec scales with respect to
non-LAT-detected sources and have larger core dominance according to the
unified models.
  CONCLUSIONS. The LAT-detected BL Lacs seem to be composed of a bulk of
""classical"" sources dominated by Doppler boosting and characterised by compact
and bright radio emission as well as hard $\gamma$-ray spectra. Moreover, we
have identified a possible population of low-luminosity BL Lacs not detected by
LAT, lacking a VLBI core, and with a small Doppler factor. Furthermore, three
LAT-detected sources show non-classical properties for $\gamma$-ray emitting BL
Lacs (no evidence of relativistic jet, low Doppler factor in radio images,
relatively low core dominance) and three other sources, while showing radio
emission on parsec scales, are not detected in $\gamma$ rays so far.

created between two modes of the system using the fast dissipation of the third
mode. These correlations result in a directional form of entanglement, called
quantum or EPR steering. We illustrate this on examples of the interactions
among damped radiation modes in an optomechanical three-mode system. By
assuming that one of the modes undergoes fast dissipation, we show that the
coupling of that mode to one or two other modes of the system may result in
one- or two-way quantum steering. Explicit analytical results are given for the
steering parameters. We find that two modes coupled by the parametric-type
interaction and damped with the same rates can be entangled but cannot exhibit
quantum steering. When, in addition, one of the modes is coupled to a fast
damped mode, steering correlations are created and the modes then exhibit
one-way steering. The creation of the steering correlations is interpreted in
the context of the variances of the quadrature components of the modes that the
steering correlations result from an asymmetry in the variances of the
quadrature components of the modes induced by the auxiliary mode. It is found
that the fluctuations act directionally that quantum steering may occur only
when the variance of the steering mode is larger that the variance of the
steered mode. The scheme is shown to be quite robust against the thermal
excitation of the modes if the fluctuations of the steering mode are larger
than the fluctuations of the steered mode.

produce the observed population of accreting sources remain to be determined.
It is a challenge to uniquely disentangle signatures of seeding from fueling
and dynamics that shapes the assembly history of growing black holes. To
address this, we use a semi-analytic model developed to track the growth of
supermassive black holes adopting multiple prescriptions for accretion. In
contrast with earlier treatments, we explore the interplay between seeding
models and two accretion modes. We find that signatures of the initial seeding
do survive in the following observational probes: the black hole occupation
fraction; contribution to the unresolved X-ray background; low-luminosity and
high-redshift luminosity functions; and in gravitational wave event signatures.
We find that the behaviour of the low-mass end of the M-sigma relation is
dominated by uncertainties in the adopted accretion prescriptions and does not
offer clear discrimination between seeding models. We make concrete predictions
for future surveys, particularly for the Lynx X-ray surveyor and LISA (The
Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) mission, which will each provide different
and yet strong constraints on the seed population. Black hole coalescences
detected by LISA and high-redshift quasar luminosity functions observed by Lynx
will offer the sharpest seeding discriminants. Although the signatures of the
black hole seeding mechanism that persist remain linked to our understanding of
black hole accretion and dynamics, we offer new insights on how these upcoming
multi-wavelength observations could be leveraged to effectively disentangle
them.

electromagnetic decays that inject lower energies, between 1-100 MeV. We
compute the electromagnetic cascade from such injections and we show that it
can deviate significantly from the universal spectrum commonly used in BBN
calculations. For electron injection below 100 MeV, we find that the final

spectro-interferometric observations of the multicomponent outer atmosphere of

Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) at 2.28--2.31 micron with a spectral
resolution of 12000 and at projected baselines of 7.3, 14.6, and 21.8 m. The
high spectral resolution of the VLTI/AMBER instrument allowed us to spatially
resolve Arcturus in the individual CO lines. Comparison of the observed
interferometric data with the MARCS photospheric model shows that the star
appears to be significantly larger than predicted by the model. It indicates
the presence of an extended component that is not accounted for by the current
photospheric models for this well-studied star. We found out that the observed
AMBER data can be explained by a model with two additional CO layers above the
photosphere. The inner CO layer is located just above the photosphere, at 1.04
+/- 0.02 stellar radii, with a temperature of 1600 +/- 400 K and a CO column
density of 10^{20 +/- 0.3} cm^-2. On the other hand, the outer CO layer is
found to be as extended as to 2.6 +/- 0.2 stellar radii with a temperature of
1800 +/- 100 K and a CO column density of 10^{19 +/- 0.15} cm^-2. The
properties of the inner CO layer are in broad agreement with those previously
inferred from the spatially unresolved spectroscopic analyses. However, our
AMBER observations have revealed that the quasi-static cool molecular component
extends out to 2--3 stellar radii, within which region the chromospheric wind

anatomical features in the heart, and anatomy induced drift. The fact that
anatomy and structural anisotropy of the heart is consistent within a species
suggested its possible functional effect on spontaneous drift of cardiac
re-entry. A comparative study of the anatomy induced drift could be used in
order to predict evolution of atrial arrhythmia, and improve low-voltage
defibrillation protocols and ablation strategies. Here, in micro-CT based model
of rat pulmonary vein wall, and in sheep atria models based on high resolution
serial histological sections, we demonstrate effects of heart geometry and
anisotropy on cardiac re-entry anatomy induced drift, its pinning to
fluctuations of thickness in the layer. The data sets of sheep atria and rat
pulmonary vein wall are incorporated into the BeatBox High Performance
Computing simulation environment. Re-entry is initiated at prescribed locations
in the spatially homogeneous mono-domain models of cardiac tissue. Excitation
is described by FitzHugh-Nagumo kinetics. In the in-silico models, isotropic
and anisotropic conduction show specific anatomy effects and the interplay
between anatomy and anisotropy of the heart. The main objectives are to
demonstrate the functional role of the species hearts geometry and anisotropy
on cardiac re-entry anatomy induced drift. In case of the rat pulmonary vein
wall with ~90 degree transmural fibre rotation, it is shown that the joint
effect of the PV wall geometry and anisotropy turns a plane excitation wave
into a re-entry pinned to a small fluctuation of thickness in the wall.

Feynman's rules. The automated evaluation of BMBPT diagrams of order $p$ relies
both on the application of algebraic Feynman's rules and on the identification
of a powerful diagrammatic rule providing the result of the remaining $p$-tuple

similar to that of a single vortex, except for the smallest velocities which
involve contributions from many distant vortices; the result is a truncated
$5/3$-stable distribution with variance (and mean energy) linear in the vortex
volume fraction $\phi$. The distribution has an inner core with a width scaling
as $\phi^{3/5}$, then long tails with power law $|u|^{-8/3}$, and finally a
fixed cutoff (independent of $\phi$) above which the probability density scales
as $|u|^{-5}$, where $u$ is a component of the velocity. We argue that this

gravitational wave observatories to phase transitions associated with dark
matter. This is because there are few parameters and those fixing the relic
density also determine the effective potential establishing the strength of the
phase transition. Particularly promising for LISA and even the Einstein
Telescope is the super-cool dark matter regime, with DM masses above

commonly observed in AGN but the low intrinsic spatial resolution of

properties. The MAGNUM survey aims at overcoming these limitations by focusing
on the nearest AGN, including NGC 1365, a nearby Seyfert galaxy (D~17 Mpc),
hosting a low-luminosity AGN (Lbol ~ 2x10^43 erg/s). We want to obtain a
detailed picture of the ionized gas in the central ~5 kpc of NGC 1365 in terms
of physical properties, kinematics, and ionization mechanisms. We also aim to
characterize the warm ionized outflow as a function of distance from the
nucleus and its relation with the nuclear X-ray wind. We employed VLT/MUSE
optical integral field spectroscopic observations to investigate the warm
ionized gas and Chandra ACIS-S X-ray data for the hot highly-ionized phase. We
obtained flux, kinematic, and diagnostic maps of the optical emission lines,
which we used to disentangle outflows from disk motions and measure the gas
properties down to a spatial resolution of ~70 pc. [OIII] emission mostly
traces an AGN-ionized kpc-scale biconical outflow with velocities up to ~200
km/s. H{\alpha} emission traces instead star formation in a circumnuclear ring
and along the bar, where we detect non-circular motions. Soft X-rays are mostly
due to thermal emission from the star-forming regions, but we could isolate the
AGN photoionized component which matches the [OIII] emission. The mass outflow
rate of the extended ionized outflow matches that of the nuclear X-ray wind and
then decreases with radius. However, the hard X-ray emission from the
circumnuclear ring suggests that star formation might contribute to the
outflow. The integrated mass outflow rate, kinetic energy rate, and outflow
velocity are broadly consistent with the typical relations observed in more
luminous AGN.

molecular species and the magnitude of reaction rates can vary in a wide range.
This diversity leads to hybrid models that combine deterministic and stochastic
modeling approaches. To reveal this multi-scale nature, we proposed
jump-diffusion approximation in a previous study. The key idea behind the model
was to partition reactions into fast and slow groups, and then to combine
Markov chain updating scheme for the slow set with diffusion (Langevin)
approach updating scheme for the fast set. Then, the state vector of the model
was defined as the summation of the random time change model and the solution
of the Langevin equation. In this study, we have proved that the joint
probability density function of the jump-diffusion approximation over the
reaction counting process satisfies the hybrid master equation, which is the
summation of the chemical master equation and the Fokker-Planck equation. To
solve the hybrid master equation, we propose an algorithm using the moments of
reaction counters of fast reactions given the reaction counters of slow
reactions. Then, we solve a constrained optimization problem for each
conditional probability density at the time point of interest utilizing the
maximum entropy approach. Based on the multiplication rule for joint
probability density functions, we construct the solution of the hybrid master
equation. To show the efficiency of the method, we implement it to a canonical
model of gene regulation.

from DR2 of the LEGA-C survey. Interpreting index variations in terms of
equivalent single stellar population age, we find that the median stellar
population is younger for larger galaxies at fixed stellar mass. The effect is
significant, yet small; the ages of the larger and the smaller subsets differ
by only $<500$ Myr, much less than the age variation among individual galaxies
($\sim1.5$ Gyr). At the same time, quiescent galaxies with the strongest
H$\delta$ absorption --- those experienced recent and rapid quenching events
--- tend to be smaller than the average. These co-existing trends unify
seemingly contradictory results in the literature; the complex correlations
between size and age indicators revealed by our large sample of galaxies with
high-quality spectra suggest that there are multiple evolutionary pathways to
quiescence. Regardless of the specific physical mechanisms responsible for the
cessation of star formation in massive galaxies, the large scatter in D$_n$4000
and EW(H$\delta$) immediately implies that galaxies follow a large variety in
evolutionary pathways. On the one hand, we see evidence for a process that
slowly shuts off star-formation and transforms star-forming galaxies to
quiescent galaxies without necessarily changing their structures. On the other
hand, there is likely a mechanism that rapidly quenches galaxies, an event that
coincides with dramatic structural changes, producing small post-starburst
galaxies.

  Risk Bounding Functions","33 pages, 12 figures. In review",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Chance Constrained Markov Decision Processes maximize reward subject to a
bounded probability of failure, and have been frequently applied for planning
with potentially dangerous outcomes or unknown environments. Solution
algorithms have required strong heuristics or have been limited to relatively
small problems with up to millions of states, because the optimal action to
take from a given state depends on the probability of failure in the rest of
the policy, leading to a coupled problem that is difficult to solve. In this
paper we examine a generalization of a CCMDP that trades off probability of
failure against reward through a functional relationship. We derive a
constraint that can be applied to each state history in a policy individually,
and which guarantees that the chance constraint will be satisfied. The approach
decouples states in the CCMDP, so that large problems can be solved
efficiently. We then introduce Vulcan, which uses our constraint in order to
apply Monte Carlo Tree Search to CCMDPs. Vulcan can be applied to problems
where it is unfeasible to generate the entire state space, and policies must be
returned in an anytime manner. We show that Vulcan and its variants run tens to
hundreds of times faster than linear programming methods, and over ten times
faster than heuristic based methods, all without the need for a heuristic, and
returning solutions with a mean suboptimality on the order of a few percent.
Finally, we use Vulcan to solve for a chance constrained policy in a CCMDP with
over $10^{13}$ states in 3 minutes.

acceleration and deceleration, the optimal merge position is determined from
simulations of linear combinations of the deviation of the headway from

addresses learning subtler and more complex underlying temporal dynamics in

improve upon these recent advances, by adopting concepts from the field of

consists in treating the network parameters as latent variables with a prior

standard practice of postulating Gaussian priors. Indeed, to allow for handling
outliers, which are prevalent in long observed sequences of multivariate data,
multivariate t-exponential distributions are imposed. On this basis, we proceed
to infer corresponding posteriors; these can be used for inference and
prediction at test time, in a way that accounts for the uncertainty in the
available sparse training data. Specifically, to allow for our approach to best
exploit the merits of the t-exponential family, our method considers a new

organic crystal widely used in cryopreservation. We find that cholesterol --
which is also a substantial component of cell membranes -- is an ice nucleating
agent more potent than many inorganic substrates, including the mineral
feldspar (one of the most active ice nucleating material in the atmosphere).
Scanning electron microscopy measurements reveal a variety of morphological
features on the surfaces of cholesterol crystals: this suggests that the
topography of the surface is key to the broad range of ice nucleating activity
observed (from -4 to -20 C\degree). In addition, we show via molecular
simulations that cholesterol crystals aid the formation of ice nuclei in a
unconventional fashion. Rather than providing a template for a flat ice-like
contact layer (as found in the case of many inorganic substrates), the
flexibility of the cholesterol surface and its low density of hydrophilic
functional groups leads to the formation of molecular cages involving both
water molecules and terminal hydroxyl groups of the cholesterol surface. We
argue that the phenomenal ice nucleating activity of steroids such as
cholesterol (and potentially of many other organic crystals) is due to (i) the
ability of flexible hydrophilic surfaces to form unconventional ice-templating
structures and (ii) the different nucleation sites offered by the diverse
topography of the crystalline surfaces.

pairs over confident pairs. Also, we propose another priority quantization
loss, which prioritizes hard-to-quantize examples for generation of nearly
lossless hash codes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DPH can generate
high-quality hash codes and yield state-of-the-art image retrieval results on

The NDR is implemented within a microscopic traffic simulation (S-Paramics) for

amounts to a simulation-based optimization aiming to reduce delay, CO2 and

different levels of network saturation. The results suggest that the NDR is an

allows to give a representation of the interior (resp. exterior) normal trace
of the field on the boundary of any given open set as the limit of classical
normal traces over the boundaries of interior (resp. exterior) smooth
approximations of the open set. In the particular case of open sets with

characterized by using a regularized distance. We also show that any open set
with Lipschitz boundary has a regular Lipschitz deformable boundary from the

suitable scalar functions are presented, and the connection between these
product rules and the representation of the normal trace of the field as a
Radon measure is explored. With these formulas at hand, we introduce the notion

then the Kronecker graphs generated by this initiator can be quantum searched

critical jumping rate of the walk that enables this. Second, for any fixed

generated by it are quantum searched in $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ time. This greatly
extends the number of Kronecker graphs on which quantum walks are known to

better than classical computer's $O(N)$ runtime if the initiator has more than

halo, which are dominated by a very massive early-type galaxy and lack of L*
objects. FGs are indeed characterized by a large magnitude gap between their
central and surrounding galaxies. This is explained by either speculating that
FGs are failed groups that formed without bright satellite galaxies and did not
suffer any major merger, or by suggesting that FGs are very old systems that
had enough time to exhaust their bright satellite galaxies through multiple
major mergers. Since major mergers leave signatures in the stellar populations
of the resulting galaxy, we study the stellar population parameters of the
brightest central galaxies (BCGs) of FGs as a benchmark against which the
formation and evolution scenarios of FGs can be compared. We present long-slit
spectroscopic observations along different axes of NGC 6482 and NGC 7556, which
are the BCGs of two nearby FGs. The measurements include spatially resolved
stellar kinematics and radial profiles of line-strength indices, which we
converted into stellar population parameters using single stellar-population
models. NGC 6482 and NGC 7556 are very massive and large galaxies and host a
centrally concentrated stellar population, which is significantly younger and
more metal rich than the rest of the galaxy. The age gradients of both galaxies
are somewhat larger than those of the other FG BCGs studied so far, whereas
their metallicity gradients are similarly negative and shallow. They have
negligible gradients of alpha-element abundance ratio. The measured metallicity
gradients are less steep than those predicted for massive galaxies that formed
monolithically and evolved without experiencing any major merger. We conclude
that the observed FGs formed through major mergers rather than being failed
groups that lacked bright satellite galaxies from the beginning.

and the data available at neighboring users via an imitation process. Such a
collaborative learning process prevents the users from exchanging their data
directly via the cellular network's limited backhaul links and, thus, allows
them to improve their cell association policy collaboratively with minimum
computing. To solve this problem, a neural Q-learning learning algorithm is
proposed that enables the users to predict their reward function using a neural
network whose input is the SBSs selected by neighboring users and the local

for all bipartite graphs $H$, quasirandom graphs contain asymptotically the
minimum number of copies of $H$ taken over all graphs with the same order and
edge density. This conjecture has attracted considerable interest over the last
decade and is now known to hold for a broad range of bipartite graphs, with the
overall trend saying that a graph satisfies the conjecture if it can be built
from simple building blocks such as trees in a certain recursive fashion.
  Our contribution here, which goes beyond this paradigm, is to show that the
conjecture holds for any bipartite graph $H$ with bipartition $A \cup B$ where
the number of vertices in $B$ of degree $k$ satisfies a certain divisibility
condition for each $k$. As a corollary, we have that for every bipartite graph
$H$ with bipartition $A \cup B$, there is a positive integer $p$ such that the
blow-up $H_A^p$ formed by taking $p$ vertex-disjoint copies of $H$ and gluing
all copies of $A$ along corresponding vertices satisfies the conjecture.
Another way of viewing this latter result is that for every bipartite $H$ there
is a positive integer $p$ such that an $L^p$-version of Sidorenko's conjecture
holds for $H$.

in long-baseline infrared interferometry. It allows access to the photosphere
in giant and super-giant stars relatively free from opacities of molecular
bands. The J-band can potentially be used for imaging spots in the 1350 nm
ionised iron line on slowly rotating magnetically-active stars through
spectro-interferometry. In addition, the access to the 1080 nanometres He I
line may probe outflows and funnel-flows in T-Tauri stars and allow the study
of the star-disk interaction.
  We present the progress in the development of a six-inputs, J-band
interferometric beam combiner based on the discrete beam combiner (DBC)
concept. DBCs are periodic arrays of evanescent coupled waveguides which can be
used to retrieve simultaneously the complex visibility of every baseline from a
multi-aperture interferometer. Existing, planned or future interferometric
facilities combine or will combine six or more telescopes at the time, thus
increasing the snapshot uv coverage from the interferometric measurements. A
better uv coverage will consequently enhance the accuracy of the image
reconstruction.
  The component we are currently developing is manufactured in borosilicate
glass using the technique of multi-pass ultrafast laser inscription (ULI),
using a mode-locked Yb:KYW laser at the wavelength of 1030 nm, pulse duration
of 300 fs and repetition rate of 1 MHz. After annealing, the written components
showed a propagation loss less than 0.3 dB/cm and a negligible birefringence at
a wavelength of 1310 nm, which makes the components suitable for un-polarized
light operation. A single mode fiber-to-component insertion loss of 0.9 dB was
measured. Work is currently in progress to characterize the components in
spectro-interferometric mode with white light covering the J-band spectrum.

DeepHunter performs metamorphic mutation to generate new semantically preserved

the test generation from different perspectives. To be scalable towards
practical-sized DNNs, DeepHunter maintains multiple tests in a batch, and
prioritizes the tests selection based on active feedback. The effectiveness of
DeepHunter is extensively investigated on 3 popular datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10,

can (1) significantly boost the coverage with guidance; (2) generate useful
tests to detect erroneous behaviors and facilitate the DNN model quality
evaluation; (3) accurately capture potential defects during DNN quantization
for platform migration.

uniform prior on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ in [0.05, 0.5]. The precision of our
cosmographic measurement with the doubly imaged quasar SDSS 1206+4332 is
comparable with those of quadruply imaged quasars and opens the path to perform
on selected doubles the same analysis as anticipated for quads. Our analysis is
based on a completely independent lensing code than our previous three H0LiCOW
systems and the new measurement is fully consistent with those. We provide the
analysis scripts paired with the publicly available software to facilitate
independent analysis. The consistency between blind measurements with
independent codes provides an important sanity check on lens modelling
systematics. By combining the likelihoods of the four systems under the same
prior, we obtain $H_0 = 72.5^{+2.1}_{-2.3}$kms$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$. This
measurement is independent of the distance ladder and other cosmological
probes.

application of the general algorithm, we show that the distributed geometric

the PoA and the bicriteria, another measure of the inefficiency due to selfish
routing. We find these bounds depend on: 1) the degree of the polynomial in the
road cost function and 2) the degree of asymmetry, the difference in how
human-driven and autonomous traffic affect congestion. We demonstrate that
these bounds recover the classical bounds when no asymmetry exists. We show the

Meanwhile, it also enables the wide dissemination of fake news, i.e., news with
intentionally false information, which brings significant negative effects to
the society. Thus, fake news detection is attracting increasing attention.
However, fake news detection is a non-trivial task, which requires multi-source
information such as news content, social context, and dynamic information.
First, fake news is written to fool people, which makes it difficult to detect
fake news simply based on news contents. In addition to news contents, we need
to explore social contexts such as user engagements and social behaviors. For
example, a credible user's comment that ""this is a fake news"" is a strong
signal for detecting fake news. Second, dynamic information such as how fake
news and true news propagate and how users' opinions toward news pieces are
very important for extracting useful patterns for (early) fake news detection
and intervention. Thus, comprehensive datasets which contain news content,
social context, and dynamic information could facilitate fake news propagation,
detection, and mitigation; while to the best of our knowledge, existing
datasets only contains one or two aspects. Therefore, in this paper, to
facilitate fake news related researches, we provide a fake news data repository

content, social context, and dynamic information. We present a comprehensive
description of datasets collection, demonstrate an exploratory analysis of this
data repository from different perspectives, and discuss the benefits of

discovered from the analysis of the KMT-2017-BLG-0165 microlensing event, which
has an obvious short-term deviation from the underlying light curve produced by
the host of the planet. Although the fit improvement with the microlens
parallax effect is relatively low, one component of the parallax vector is
strongly constrained from the light curve, making it possible to narrow down
the uncertainties of the lens physical properties. A Bayesian analysis yields
that the planet has a super-Neptune mass $(M_{2}=34_{-12}^{+15}~M_{\oplus})$
orbiting a Sun-like star $(M_{1}=0.76_{-0.27}^{+0.34}~M_{\odot})$ located at
$4.5~{\rm kpc}$. The blended light is consistent with these host properties.
The projected planet-host separation is $a_{\bot}={3.45_{-0.95}^{+0.98}}~{\rm

i.e., $a_{sl}\sim2.1~{\rm AU}$. KMT-2017-BLG-0165Lb is the sixteenth
microlensing planet with mass ratio $q<3\times10^{-4}$. Using the fifteen of
these planets with unambiguous mass-ratio measurements, we apply a likelihood
analysis to investigate the form of the mass-ratio function in this regime. If
we adopt a broken power law for the form of this function, then the break is at
$q_{\rm br}\simeq0.55\times10^{-4}$, which is much lower than previously
estimated. Moreover, the change of the power law slope, $\zeta>3.3$ is quite
severe. Alternatively, the distribution is also suggestive of a ""pile-up"" of
planets at Neptune-like mass ratios, below which there is a dramatic drop in
frequency.

from the orbital MR (OMR), instead of the negative MR as expected in the chiral
anomaly effect. In contrast, the absence of negative MR indicates that the
large OMR dominates over the chiral anomaly effect. This explains why it is

hence leads to an automatic smooth decoupling between low-momentum and
high-momentum components of the interaction, which is important for
finite-space shell-model calculations. Two-body interaction matrix elements,
single-particle energies and the core energy of the shell model can be
determined by the unified Gogny force. The analytical form of the Gogny force
is advantageous to treat cross-shell cases, while it is difficult to determine
the cross-shell matrix elements and single-particle energies using an empirical

develop {\em non-asymptotic convergence theory} for the SPOS framework (related
to SVGD), characterizing algorithm convergence in terms of the 1-Wasserstein
distance w.r.t.\! the numbers of particles and iterations. Somewhat
surprisingly, with the same number of updates (not too large) for each
particle, our theory suggests adopting more particles does not necessarily lead
to a better approximation of a target distribution, due to limited
computational budget and numerical errors. This phenomenon is also observed in
SVGD and verified via an experiment on synthetic data. Extensive experimental
results verify our theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
framework.

solid-phase particles applied in modern astrophysics codes designed for
modeling gas-dust circumstellar disks has been carried out for the first time.
The motion of grains whose velocities are determined mainly by the gas drag,
that is, for which the stopping time or relaxation time for the velocity of the
dust to the velocity of the gas t_{stop} is less than or comparable to the
rotation period, are considered. The methods are analyzed from the point of
view of their stability for computing the motions of small bodies, including
dust grains less than 1 micron, which are strongly coupled to the gas. Two test
problems are with analytical solutions. Fast first order accurate methods that
make it possible to avoid additional restriction on the time step due to gas
drag in computations of the motion of grains of any size are presented. For the
conditions of a circumstellar disks, the error in the velocity computations
obtained when using some stable methods become unacceptably large when the time
step size \tau>t_{stop}. For the radial migration of bodies that exhibit drifts
along nearly Keplerian orbits, an asymptotic approximation, sometimes called
the short friction time approximation or drift flux model, gives a relative
error for the radial velocity equals to St^2 where St is the Stokes number, the
ratio of the stopping time of the body to some fraction of the rotation period
(dynamical time scale) in the disk.

qubits, called magic states, which enable reliable error-corrected computation.
We present the first detailed designs of hardware functional units that
implement space-time optimized magic-state factories for surface code
error-corrected machines. Interactions among distant qubits require surface
code braids (physical pathways on chip) which must be routed. Magic-state
factories are circuits comprised of a complex set of braids that is more
difficult to route than quantum circuits considered in previous work [1]. This
paper explores the impact of scheduling techniques, such as gate reordering and
qubit renaming, and we propose two novel mapping techniques: braid repulsion
and dipole moment braid rotation. We combine these techniques with graph
partitioning and community detection algorithms, and further introduce a
stitching algorithm for mapping subgraphs onto a physical machine. Our results
show a factor of 5.64 reduction in space-time volume compared to the best-known
previous designs for magic-state factories.

comparing these to existing results of heat conductivity, we find that $D_E\ll

two-setting, two-outcome Bell test, we derive modified Bell inequalities that
relax measurement independence, for either or both observers, while remaining
locally causal. We describe the loss of measurement independence for each
observer using the parameters $M_1$ and $M_2$, as defined by Hall in 2010, and
also by a more complete description that adds two new parameters, which we call
$\hat{M}_1$ and $\hat{M}_2$, deriving a modified Bell inequality for each

work as special cases, and quantify how much the assumption of measurement
independence needs to be relaxed in order for a locally causal model to produce
a given violation of the standard Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (Bell-CHSH)
inequality. We show that both relaxed Bell inequalities are tight bounds on the
CHSH parameter by constructing locally causal models that saturate them. For
any given Bell inequality violation, the new two-parameter and four-parameter
models each require significantly less mutual information between the hidden
variables and measurement settings than previous models. We conjecture that the
new models, with optimal parameters, require the minimum possible mutual
information for a given Bell violation. We further argue that, contrary to
various claims in the literature, relaxing freedom of choice need not imply
superdeterminism.

Compared to 2D camera image, 3D data contains more information of distance and
direction. Therefore, 3D sensors are more suitable to be used in surgical scene
monitoring. However, each 3D sensor has its own limitations. For example, Lidar
(Light Detection and Ranging) can detect large-scale environment with high
precision, but the point clouds or depth maps are very sparse. As for commodity
RGBD sensors, such as Kinect, can accurately capture denser data, but limited
to a small range from 0.5 to 4.5m. So, a proper method which can address these
problems for fusing different modalities data is important. In this paper, we
proposed a method which can fuse different modalities 3D data to get a
large-scale and dense point cloud. The key contributions of our work are as
follows. First, we proposed a 3D data collecting system to reconstruct the
medical scenes. By fusing the Lidar and Kinect data, a large-scale medical
scene with more details can be reconstructed. Second, we proposed a

for learning about species distributions over a region. We illuminate the
fundamental modeling differences between the two types of data. Most simply,
locations are considered as fixed under presence/absence data; locations are
random under presence-only data. The definition of ""probability of presence"" is
incompatible between the two. So, we take issue with modeling strategies in the
literature which ignore this incompatibility, which assume that
presence/absence modeling can be induced from presence-only specifications and
therefore, that fusion of presence-only and presence/absence data sources is
routine. We argue that presence/absence data should be modeled at point level.
That is, we need to specify a surface which provides the probability of
presence at any location in the region. A realization from this surface is a
binary map yielding the results of Bernoulli trials across all locations.
Presence-only data should be modeled as a point pattern driven by specification
of an intensity function. We further argue that, with just presence/absence
data, preferential sampling, using a shared process perspective, can improve
our estimated presence/absence surface and prediction of presence. We also
argue that preferential sampling can enable a probabilistically coherent fusion
of the two data types. We illustrate with two real datasets, one
presence/absence, one presence-only for invasive species presence in New
England in the United States. We demonstrate that potential bias in sampling
locations can affect inference with regard to presence/absence and show that
inference can be improved with preferential sampling ideas. We also provide a
probabilistically coherent fusion of the two datasets to again improve
inference with regard to presence/absence.

transactions in blocks through user-defined scripts known as smart contracts.
To append a correct block into blockchain, miners execute these transactions of
smart contracts sequentially. Later the validators serially re-execute the
smart contract transactions of the block to validate it. If validation is
successful then the block is added to the blockchain using a consensus protocol
and miner gets the incentive. In the current era of multi-core processors, by
employing the serial execution of the transactions, the miners and validators
fail to utilize the cores properly and as a result, have poor throughput. By
entitling concurrency to smart contracts execution, we can achieve better
efficiency and higher throughput. In this proposal, we develop a novel and
efficient technique to execute the smart contract transactions concurrently by
miner using optimistic Software Transactional Memory systems (STMs). The miner
proposes a block which consists of the set of transactions, conflict graph,
hash of previous block and final state of each shared data-objects. Later, we
propose concurrent validator which re-executes the same smart contracts
concurrently and deterministically with the help of conflict graph given by

appended into the blockchain and miner gets the incentive. We consider a
benchmarks from solidity documentation. We execute the smart contract

Recently a promising approach has been the use of agent based models (ABMs) to
simulate aggregate market dynamics. A key aspect of these models is the
endogenous emergence of critical transitions between equilibria, i.e. market
collapses, caused by multiple equilibria and changing market parameters.
Several research themes have developed microeconomic based models that include
multiple equilibria: social decision theory (Brock and Durlauf), quantal
response models (McKelvey and Palfrey), and strategic complementarities
(Goldstein). A gap that needs to be filled in the literature is a unified
analysis of the relationship between these models and how aggregate criticality
emerges from the individual agent level. This article reviews the agent-based
foundations of markets starting with the individual agent perspective of
McFadden and the aggregate perspective of catastrophe theory emphasising
connections between the different approaches. It is shown that changes in the
uncertainty agents have in the value of their interactions with one another,
even if these changes are one-sided, plays a central role in systemic market
risks such as market instability and the twin crises effect. These interactions
can endogenously cause crises that are an emergent phenomena of markets.

computational data that is built around a distributed linear forest-of-octrees
data structure. Such octrees are frequently used in element-based numerical
simulations; they store the leaves of the tree that are local in the curent
parallel partition.
  We proceed in three stages. First, we prune all elements whose bounding box
is not visible by a parallel top-down traversal, and repartition the remaining
ones for load-balancing. Second, we intersect each element with every ray
passing its box to derive color and opacity values for the ray segment. To
reduce data, we aggregate the segments up the octree in a strictly distributed
fashion in cycles of coarsening and repartition. Third, we composite all
remaining ray segments to a tiled partition of the image and write it to disk
using parallel I/O.
  The scalability of the method derives from three concepts: By exploiting the
space filling curve encoding of the octrees and by relying on recently
developed tree algorithms for top-down partition traversal, we are able to
determine sender/receiver pairs without handshaking and/or collective
communication. Furthermore, by partnering the linear traversal of tree leaves
with the group action of the attenuation/emission ODE along each segment, we
avoid back-to-front sorting of elements throughout. Lastly, the method is
problem adaptive with respect to the refinement and partition of the elements
and to the accuracy of ODE integration.

for infinite dimensional independent increment processes defined on some
abstract Banach space $B$. It is similar in nature to the polynomial preserving

offers an infinite dimensional generalisation. However, while polynomials are
defined using the multiplication operator and as such require a Banach algebra
structure, the multilinearity preserving property we prove here holds even for
processes defined on a Banach space which is not necessary a Banach algebra. In
the special case of $B$ being a commutative Banach algebra, we show that
independent increment processes are polynomial processes in a sense that
coincides with a canonical extension of polynomial processes from the finite
dimensional case. The assumption of commutativity is shown to be crucial and in
a non-commutative Banach algebra the multilinearity concept arises naturally.
Some of our results hold beyond independent increment processes and thus shed
light on infinite dimensional polynomial processes in general.

of these algorithms, however, need to include some proximal term in the
augmented Lagrangian function such that the resulting algorithm can be

the convergence speed because it forces the current solution to stay close to
the solution obtained in the previous iteration. To address this issue, in this
paper, we first introduce the notion of simplest bipartite graph, which is
defined as a bipartite graph that has a minimum number of edges to keep the
graph connected. A simple two-step message passing-based procedure is proposed
to find a simplest bipartite graph associated with the original graph. We show
that the simplest bipartite graph has some interesting properties. By utilizing
these properties, an ADMM without involving any proximal terms can be developed
to perform decentralized composite optimization over the simplest bipartite
graph. Simulation results show that our proposed method achieves a much faster

crucial for a wide variety of applications. Since the matting problem is
severely under-constrained, most previous methods require user interactions to
take user designated trimaps or scribbles as constraints. This user-in-the-loop

employ implicit semantic constraints learned from data and propose an automatic
human matting algorithm (SHM). SHM is the first algorithm that learns to
jointly fit both semantic information and high quality details with deep
networks. In practice, simultaneously learning both coarse semantics and fine

gives a probabilistic estimation of the alpha matte. We also construct a very
large dataset with high quality annotations consisting of 35,513 unique
foregrounds to facilitate the learning and evaluation of human matting.
Extensive experiments on this dataset and plenty of real images show that SHM
achieves comparable results with state-of-the-art interactive matting methods.

Properties that cannot be identified by either method are not. Our results
provide an initial indication that semantic properties relevant for the way

here we investigate possible scenarios of ocean circulations on exoplanets

planetary rotation rate, wind stress, fluid eddy viscosity and land structure
(a closed basin vs. a reentrant channel) influence the pattern and strength of
wind-driven ocean circulations. The meridional variation of the Coriolis force,
arising from planetary rotation and the spheric shape of the planets, induces
the western intensification of ocean circulations. Our simulations confirm that
in a closed basin, changes of other factors contribute to only enhancing or
weakening the ocean circulations (e.g., as wind stress decreases or fluid eddy
viscosity increases, the ocean circulations weaken, and vice versa). In a
reentrant channel, just as the Southern Ocean region on the Earth, the ocean
pattern is characterized by zonal flows. In the quasi-linear case, the
sensitivity of ocean circulations characteristics to these parameters is also
interpreted using simple analytical models. This study is the preliminary step
for exploring the possible ocean circulations on exoplanets, future work with

transport in granular media requires an improved fundamental understanding. In
this study, the effects of packing structure on heat transfer in granular media
are evaluated at macro- and grain-scales. At the grain-scale, a gas-solid
coupling heat transfer model is adapted into a discrete-element-method to
simulate this transport phenomenon. The numerical framework is validated by
experimental data obtained using a plane source technique, and the
Smoluschowski effect of the gas phase is found to be captured by this
extension. By considering packings of spherical SiO2 grains with an
interstitial helium phase, vibration induced ordering in granular media is
studied, using the simulation methods developed here, to investigate how
disorder-to-order transitions of packing structure enhance effective thermal
conductivity. Grain-scale thermal transport is shown to be influenced by the
local neighbourhood configuration of individual grains. The formation of an
ordered packing structure enhances both global and local thermal transport.
This study provides a structure approach to explain transport phenomena, which
can be applied in properties modification for granular media.

has been deeply studied during the four decades elapsed since its discovery.
However, observations at very high radio frequencies with good angular
resolution are still very scarce in the literature. The present paper tries to
partially fill this gap using archival data of the source obtained with the
Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). Aims. We aim to study the SS 433 jet
properties at radio frequencies corresponding to millimetre wavelengths where
the synchrotron emitting particles are expected to lose their energy much
faster than at lower frequencies of centimetre wavelengths. Results. A resolved
view of the SS 433 radio core and jets is presented. In addition to spectral
index and magnetic field measurements, we are able to estimate the age of the
oldest visible ejecta still radiating significantly at millimetre wavelengths.
By combining our findings with those of previous authors at lower frequencies,
we confirm that the energy loss of the radiating electrons is dominated by
adiabatic expansion instead of synchrotron radiative losses. In addition, we
find suggestive evidence for the previously proposed period of slowed expansion
within the first months of the ejecta flow, needed to simultaneously match the
radiative lifetime observed in the centimetre domain. Our results argue for the
need for future coordinated millimetre and centimetre interferometric
observations with good time sampling throughout the SS 433 precessional cycle
to better understand energetic processes in stellar relativistic jets.

sources. We focus on chiral solutions where only the left-moving sector is

to solving the $\mathcal{A}_{N-1}$ Toda equations with delta function sources,

this monodromy problem is equivalent to the monodromy problem for a particular
$\mathcal{W}_N$ vacuum conformal block at large central charge. Therefore,

our geometric approach. For instance, the real part of the spectral curve is
geometrically realized as the motion of the monodromy axis when varying total
torsion. This insight provides a new explicit formula for the hierarchy of
Hamiltonians. We also interpret the complex spectral curve in terms of curves
in hyperbolic space and Darboux transforms. Furthermore, we complete the
hierarchy of Hamiltonians by adding area and volume. These allow for the
characterization of elastic curves as solutions to an isoperimetric problem:
elastica are the critical points of length while fixing area and volume.

but the origin of this phenomenon is still debated. We investigate the role
cool supergiants may have played. To do this, we combine two investigative
methods: state-of-the-art massive stellar evolution and calculations of the
hydrodynamic structure of the cluster-gas. This approach allows us to study how
star-formation in young massive clusters depends on the energy- and mass-input
of the first-generation of stars, while predicting the chemical composition of
the second-generation. We find that the presence of massive (9-500 M$_{\odot}$)
metal-poor supergiants in the young cluster leads to a star-formation episode
within the first 4 Myr of the cluster's lifetime, that is, before the first
core-collapse supernovae explode or the gas is expelled. The stellar winds
accumulate in the cluster center, forming the second-generation there. Its
composition is predicted to show variations in O & Na abundances, consistently
with observations. The abundance of helium is, similarly to other scenarios
involving massive stars, higher than what is referred from observations.
Supposing dynamical removal of stars from the outskirts of the cluster, or
applying a top-heavy initial-mass-function, we can predict a number ratio of
the second-generation as high as 20-80%. The effect of metallicity is shown to
be important, as the most luminous supergiants are only predicted at
low-metallicity, thus limiting $-$ but not excluding $-$ the extent of a
polluted second-generation at high-metallicity. These massive stars becoming
black-holes suggests globular-clusters hosting gravitational-wave progenitors.
Our scenario predicts a correlation between the mass of the cluster and the
extent of the multiple population phenomenon.

determining which exoplanets are potentially habitable and for designing future
telescopes to observe them. Here, we explore differences in estimating the
inner edge among seven one-dimensional (1D) radiative transfer models: two
line-by-line codes (SMART and LBLRTM) as well as five band codes (CAM3,
CAM4_Wolf, LMDG, SBDART, and AM2) that are currently being used in global
climate models. We compare radiative fluxes and spectra in clear-sky conditions
around G- and M-stars, with fixed moist adiabatic profiles for surface
temperatures from 250 to 360 K. We find that divergences among the models arise
mainly from large uncertainties in water vapor absorption in the window region
(10 um) and in the region between 0.2 and 1.5 um. Differences in outgoing
longwave radiation increase with surface temperature and reach 10-20 Wm^-2;
differences in shortwave reach up to 60 Wm^-2, especially at the surface and in
the troposphere, and are larger for an M-dwarf spectrum than a solar spectrum.
Differences between the two line-by-line models are significant, although
smaller than among the band models. Our results imply that the uncertainty in
estimating the insolation threshold of the inner edge (the runaway greenhouse
limit) due only to clear-sky radiative transfer is ~10% of modern Earth's solar
constant (i.e., ~34 Wm^-2 in global mean) among band models and ~3% between the
two line-by-line models. These comparisons show that future work is needed
focusing on improving water vapor absorption coefficients in both shortwave and
longwave, as well as on increasing the resolution of stellar spectra in
broadband models.

firstly introduces graph database, power system graph modeling and potential
graph computing applications in power systems. Two iterative methods based on

Vertex contraction is proposed to improve the performance by eliminating

this paper, a novel solution is proposed that enables the non-orthogonal

Nodes (ENs), while eMBB communications are handled centrally at a cloud
processor as in a Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN) system. This solution
guarantees the low-latency requirements of the URLLC service by means of edge

transmitters, rate adaptation for eMBB transmitters, finite fronthaul capacity,
and different coexistence strategies, such as puncturing.

binaries enables direct measurement of the properties of the black holes. An
individual observation allows measurement of the black-hole masses, but only
limited information about either the magnitude or orientation of the black hole
spins is available, primarily due to the degeneracy between measurements of
spin and binary mass ratio. Using the first six black-hole merger observations,
we are able to constrain the distribution of black-hole spins. We perform model
selection between a set of models with different spin population models
combined with a power-law mass distribution to make inferences about the spin
distribution. We assume a fixed power-law mass distribution on the black holes,
which is supported by the data and provides a realistic distribution of binary
mass-ratio. This allows us to accurately account for selection effects due to
variations in the signal amplitude with spin magnitude, and provides an
improved inference on the spin distribution. We conclude that the first six
LIGO and Virgo observations (Abbott et al. 2016a, 2017a,b,c) disfavour highly
spinning black holes against low spins by an odds-ratio of 15:1; thus providing
strong constraints on spin magnitudes from gravitational-wave observations.
Furthermore, we are able to rule out a population of binaries with completely
aligned spins, even when the spins of the individual black holes are low, at an
odds ratio of 22,000:1, significantly strengthening earlier evidence against
aligned spins (Farr et al. 2017). These results provide important information
that will aid in our understanding on the formation processes of black-holes.

and the black hole information problem taught by Dieter L\""ust during the

relativity, which describes gravity in terms of the curvature of space-time,
and examines the properties of black holes. These are central objects in
general relativity which arise when sufficient energy is compressed into a
finite volume, so that even light cannot escape its gravitational pull. We will
see that black holes exhibit a profound connection with thermodynamic systems.
Indeed, by quantizing a field theory on curved backgrounds, one can show that
black holes emit thermal (Hawking) radiation, so that the connection with
thermodynamics is more than a formal similarity. Hawking radiation gives rise
to an apparent conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics known
as the black hole information problem. If a black hole formed from a pure
quantum state evaporates to form thermal radiation, which is in a mixed state,
then the unitarity postulate of quantum mechanics is violated. We will examine
the black hole information problem, which has plagued the physics community for
over four decades, and consider prominent examples of proposed solutions, in
particular, the string theoretical construction of the Tangherlini black hole,
and the infinite number of asymptotic symmetries given by BMS-transformations.

partial order on the symmetric group: the weak order. This partial order is,
among other things, a semidistributive lattice. As a consequence, every
permutation has a canonical representation as a join of other permutations.
Combinatorially, these canonical join representations can be modeled in terms
of arc diagrams. Moreover, these arc diagrams also serve as a model to
understand quotient lattices of the weak order. A particularly well-behaved
quotient lattice of the weak order is the well-known Tamari lattice, which
appears in many seemingly unrelated areas of mathematics. The arc diagrams
representing the members of the Tamari lattices are better known as noncrossing
partitions. Recently, the Tamari lattices were generalized to parabolic
quotients of the symmetric group. In this article, we undertake a structural
investigation of these parabolic Tamari lattices, and explain how modified arc
diagrams aid the understanding of these lattices.

image analysis suffers from a chronic lack of labeled data and skewed class

skin lesions could act as a reliever for the aforementioned problems.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been successfully used to
synthesize realistically looking medical images, however limited to low
resolution, whereas machine learning models for challenging tasks such as skin
lesion segmentation or classification benefit from much higher resolution data.
In this work, we successfully synthesize realistically looking images of skin
lesions with GANs at such high resolution. Therefore, we utilize the concept of
progressive growing, which we both quantitatively and qualitatively compare to
other GAN architectures such as the DCGAN and the LAPGAN. Our results show that
with the help of progressive growing, we can synthesize highly realistic

not only by a planet's current stellar insolation and atmospheric properties,

icy planets and moons become habitable after their initial ice shield melts as
their host stars brighten. Here we show from global climate model simulations
that a habitable state is not achieved in the climatic evolution of those icy
planets and moons that possess an inactive carbonate-silicate cycle and low
concentrations of greenhouse gases. Examples for such planetary bodies are the
icy moons Europa and Enceladus, and certain icy exoplanets orbiting G and F
stars. We find that the stellar fluxes that are required to overcome a planet's
initial snowball state are so large that they lead to significant water loss
and preclude a habitable planet. Specifically, they exceed the moist greenhouse
limit, at which water vapour accumulates at high altitudes where it can readily
escape, or the runaway greenhouse limit, at which the strength of the
greenhouse increases until the oceans boil away. We suggest that some icy
planetary bodies may transition directly to a moist or runaway greenhouse
without passing through a habitable Earth-like state.

were fitted by the two models, including the Fe I fluorescence and the Compton

the WD mass and mass accretion rate, are in a reasonable range in comparison to
their classical WD binary counterparts. Additional pieces of evidence in the
X-ray spectra (partial covering, Fe L lines, and Fe I fluorescence) were not
conclusive enough to classify these two sources into a sub-class of accreting

of vibrational modes of macroscopic mechanical resonators, the manipulation of

standard mechanism relies on the cavity photons directly modifying the state of
the mechanical resonator. Hybrid cavity optomechanics provides an alternative
approach by coupling mechanical objects to quantum emitters, either directly or
indirectly via the common interaction with a cavity field mode. While many
approaches exist, they typically share a simple effective description in terms
of a single force acting on the mechanical resonator. More generally, one can
study the interplay between various forces acting on the mechanical resonator
in such hybrid mechanical devices. This interplay can lead to interference
effects that may, for instance, improve cooling of the mechanical motion or
lead to generation of entanglement between various parts of the hybrid device.
Here, we provide such an example of a hybrid optomechanical system where an
ensemble of quantum emitters is embedded into the mechanical resonator formed
by a vibrating membrane. The interference between the radiation pressure force
and the mechanically modulated Tavis--Cummings interaction leads to enhanced
cooling dynamics in regimes in which neither force is efficient by itself. Our
results pave the way towards engineering novel optomechanical interactions in
hybrid optomechanical systems.

applications in future wireless networks by smartly reconfiguring the signal
propagation for performance enhancement. Specifically, an IRS consists of a
large number of low-cost passive elements each reflecting the incident signal
with a certain phase shift to collaboratively achieve beamforming and suppress
interference at one or more designated receivers. In this paper, we study an
IRS-enhanced point-to-point multiple-input single-output (MISO) wireless system
where one IRS is deployed to assist in the communication from a multi-antenna
access point (AP) to a single-antenna user. As a result, the user
simultaneously receives the signal sent directly from the AP as well as that
reflected by the IRS. We aim to maximize the total received signal power at the
user by jointly optimizing the (active) transmit beamforming at the AP and
(passive) reflect beamforming by the phase shifters at the IRS. We first
propose a centralized algorithm based on the technique of semidefinite
relaxation (SDR) by assuming the global channel state information (CSI)
available at the IRS. Since the centralized implementation requires excessive
channel estimation and signal exchange overheads, we further propose a
low-complexity distributed algorithm where the AP and IRS independently adjust
the transmit beamforming and the phase shifts in an alternating manner until
the convergence is reached. Simulation results show that significant
performance gains can be achieved by the proposed algorithms as compared to
benchmark schemes. Moreover, it is verified that the IRS is able to drastically
enhance the link quality and/or coverage over the conventional setup without
the IRS.

partition the computation tasks into various parts for local execution and

subject to the so-called energy neutrality constraints, such that their energy

jointly optimizing the transmit energy beamforming at the ET, as well as the
communication and computation resource allocations at both the user and

regular grid and aim to live in a neighborhood that matches the minimum desired
fraction of members of the same ethnicity. The model shows that observed
segregation can be the emergent result of people interacting under spatial
constraints in pursuit of such homophily preferences. Even mild homophily
preferences can generate high degrees of segregation at the macro level. In
modern, ethnically diverse societies people might not define similarity based
on ethnicity. Instead, shared tolerance towards ethnic diversity might play a
more significant role, impacting segregation and integration patterns in
societies. Bearing this consideration in mind, we extend Schelling's model by
dividing the population of agents into value-oriented and ethnicity-oriented
agents. Using parameter sweeping, we explore the consequences that the mutual
adaptation of these two types of agents has on ethnic segregation, value
segregation, and population density in the neighborhood. Such consequences are
examined for equally sized ethnic groups and for majority-minority conditions.
The introduction of value-oriented agents reduces total ethnic segregation when
compared to Schelling's original model, but the new phenomenon of value
segregation appears to be more pronounced than ethnic segregation. Furthermore,
due to cross-contagion, stronger ethnic homophily preferences lead not only to
greater ethnic segregation but also to more value segregation. Stronger
value-orientation of the tolerant agents similarly leads to increased ethnic
segregation of the ethnicity-oriented agents. Also, value-oriented agents tend
to live in neighborhoods with more agents than ethnicity-oriented agents. In
majority-minority settings, such effects appear to be more drastic for the
minority than the majority ethnicity.

effective in many physical relevant situations. The mathematical justifications
of such approximations rely generally on specific considerations which depend
too much on the model and on the initial states of the system which are
required to be well-prepared. In this article, using the method of Wigner
measures, we prove in a fairly complete generality the accuracy of the
mean-field approximation. Roughly speaking, we show that the dynamics of a
many-boson system are well approximated, in the limit of a large number of
particles, by a one particle mean-field equation if the following general
principles are satisfied: $\bullet$ The Hamiltonian is in a mean-field regime
(i.e.: The interaction and the free energy parts are of the same order with
respect to the number of particles). $\bullet$ The interaction is relatively
compact with respect to a one particle and it is dominated by the free energy
part. $\bullet$ There exists at most one weak solution for the mean-field
equation for each initial condition.The convergence towards the mean field
limit is described in terms of Wigner (probability) measures and it holds for
any initial quantum states with a finite free energy average. The main novelty
of this article lies in the use of fine properties of uniqueness for the

the response of graphene to electromagnetic fluctuations is described in the

the Euclidean plane is replace by an arbitrary analytic Riemannian manifold

problem under model uncertainty. We develop a continuous time framework for
taking into account ambiguity aversion about both expected return rates and
correlation matrix of the assets, and for studying the join effects on
portfolio diversification. The dynamic setting allows us to consider time
varying ambiguity sets, which include the cases where the drift and correlation
are estimated on a rolling window of historical data or when the investor takes
into account learning on the ambiguity. In this context, we prove a general
separation principle for the associated robust control problem, which allows us
to reduce the determination of the optimal dynamic strategy to the parametric
computation of the minimal risk premium function. Our results provide a
justification for under-diversification, as documented in empirical studies and
in the static models [16], [34]. Furthermore, we explicitly quantify the degree
of under-diversification in termsof correlation bounds and Sharpe ratios
proximities, and emphasize the different features induced by drift and
correlation ambiguity. In particular, we show that an investor with a poor
confidence in the expected return estimation does not hold any risky asset, and
on the other hand, trades only one risky asset when the level of ambiguity on
correlation matrix is large. We also provide a complete picture of the
diversification for the optimal robust portfolio in the three-asset case JEL

define the optimization of a cost on the validation set subject to another
optimization on the training set. The overfitting is controlled by introducing
weights on each mini-batch in the training set and by choosing their values so
that they minimize the error on the validation set. In practice, these weights
define mini-batch learning rates in a gradient descent update equation that
favor gradients with better generalization capabilities. Because of its

for the basis-set error of wave-function theory (WFT). One of the key ideas
developed here is to define a range-separation parameter which automatically
adapts to a given basis set. The derivation of the exact equations are based on
the Levy-Lieb formulation of DFT, which helps us to define a complementary
functional which corrects uniquely for the basis-set error of WFT. The coupling
of DFT and WFT is done through the definition of a real-space representation of
the electron-electron Coulomb operator projected in a one-particle basis set.
Such an effective interaction has the particularity to coincide with the exact
electron-electron interaction in the limit of a complete basis set, and to be
finite at the electron-electron coalescence point when the basis set is
incomplete. The non-diverging character of the effective interaction allows one
to define a mapping with the long-range interaction used in the context of
range-separated DFT and to design practical approximations for the unknown
complementary functional. Here, a local-density approximation is proposed for
both full-configuration-interaction (FCI) and selected
configuration-interaction approaches. Our theory is numerically tested to
compute total energies and ionization potentials for a series of atomic
systems. The results clearly show that the DFT correction drastically improves
the basis-set convergence of both the total energies and the energy
differences. For instance, a sub kcal/mol accuracy is obtained from the
aug-cc-pVTZ basis set with the method proposed here when an aug-cc-pV5Z basis
set barely reaches such a level of accuracy at the near FCI level.

endogenous social division of labour. The theory is founded on the notion of a
""consumer-producer"", who consumes as well as produces commodities. First, we
show that the Core of such an economy with an endogenous social division of
labour can be founded on deviations of coalitions of arbitrary size, extending
the seminal insights of Vind and Schmeidler for pure exchange economies.
Furthermore, we establish the equivalence between the Core and the set of
competitive equilibria for continuum economies with an endogenous social
division of labour. Our analysis also concludes that self-organisation in a
social division of labour can be incorporated into the Edgeworthian barter
process directly. This is formulated as a Core equivalence result stated for a
Structured Core concept based on renegotiations among fully specialised
economic agents, i.e., coalitions that use only fully developed internal
divisions of labour. Our approach bridges the gap between standard economies
with social production and coalition production economies. Therefore, a more
straightforward and natural interpretation of coalitional improvement and the
Core can be developed than for coalition production economies.

white dwarf mergers in the intermediate mass range ($0.4<M_{tot}<1.1$
M$_{\odot}$). After a merger, a He envelope surrounds a CO core, and a
short-lived supergiant phase starts. RCBs correspond to that phase. They are
known to be hydrogen-deficient and carbon-rich supergiant stars. They are rare;
They are also highly diverse in chemical abundances, brightness and photosphere
temperature. To understand their evolutionary path, constrain their spatial
distribution and test their formation rate, we aim to increase significantly
the number of known RCBs. To do so, we need first to create a list of targets
of interest rich in RCB stars, that will be subsequently followed-up
spectroscopically to reveal their true nature. Fortunately, RCBs are producing
dust and are therefore surrounded by warm circumstellar dust shells. Using the
all-sky 2MASS and WISE infrared surveys, our goal is to discriminate RCBs among
other dust-producing stars. A series of selection criteria was applied to
colour-colour diagrams and to the brightness of all objects catalogued. The
criteria were designed using all 102 known RCB stars. RCB SED models were also
used to understand the limits of the criteria and the possible bias in terms of
shell temperature selected. The analysis was complicated by the unpredictable
photometric declines that RCB stars are known to undergo. With a detection
efficiency of about 85\%, our analysis selected only 2356 targets among the 563
million objects catalogued in the WISE All-Sky survey. This short list of
targets of interest supersedes a previously published one made from the
preliminary WISE data release. This list, published in the CDS Vizier database,
will allow us to increase significantly the number of known RCB stars.

our Universe can not be a cosmological constant, but mostly the potential
energy of an evolving quintessence scalar field. As the dark energy includes
the effects of the electroweak symmetry breaking and the QCD chiral symmetry
breaking, if the dS swampland conjecture is applicable for the low energy
quintessence potential, it can be applied for the Higgs and pion potential
also. On the other hand, the Higgs and pion potential has the well-known dS
extrema, and applying the dS swampland conjecture to those dS extrema may
provide stringent constraints on the viable quintessence, as well as on the
conjecture itself. We examine this issue and find that the pion dS extremum at
$\cos(\pi_0/f_\pi)=-1$ implies $c\lesssim {\cal O}(10^{-2}-10^{-5})$ for
$arbitrary$ form of the quintessence potential and couplings, where the weaker
bound ($10^{-2}$) is available $only$ for a specific type of quintessence whose
couplings respect the equivalence principle, while the stronger bound
($10^{-5}$) applies for generic quintessence violating the equivalence
principle. We also discuss the possibility to relax this bound with an
additional scalar field, e.g. a light modulus which has a runaway behavior at
the pion dS extremum. We argue that such possibility is severely constrained by
a variety of observational constraints which do not leave a room to
significantly relax the bound. We make a similar analysis for the Higgs dS
extremum at $H=0$, which results in a weaker bound on $c$.

regions, as waves in ice influence many phenomena such as ice drift, ice
breaking, and ice formation. However, the models presented so far in the
literature are limited in a number of regards, and more insights are required
from either laboratory experiments or fieldwork for these models to be
validated and improved. Unfortunately, performing detailed measurements of wave
propagation in grease ice, either on the field or in the laboratory, is
challenging. As a consequence, laboratory data are relatively scarce, and often
consist of only a couple of wave elevation measurements along the length of the
wave tank. We present combined measurements of wave elevation using an array of
ultrasonic probes, and water kinematics using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV),
in a small-scale wave tank experiment. Experiments are performed over a wider
frequency range than what has been previously investigated. The wave elevation
measurements are used to compute the wave number and exponential damping
coefficient. By contrast with a previous study in grease ice, we find that the
wave number is consistent with the mass loading model, i.e. it increases
compared with the open water case. Wave attenuation is compared with a series
of one-layer models, and we show that they satisfactorily describe the viscous
damping that is taking place. PIV data are also consistent with exponential
wave amplitude attenuation, and a POD analysis reveals the existence of mean
flows under the ice that are a consequence of the displacement and packing of
the ice induced by the gradient in the wave-induced stress. Finally, we show
that the dynamics of grease ice can generate eddy structures that inject eddy
viscosity in the water under the grease ice, which would lead to enhanced
mixing and participating in energy dissipation.

long-range order consistent with an observed reduction of the monopole energy

addition of a model for explaining the decay of the mass density $\varrho$ of

Elementary particles contain information about which laws of nature they obey,
but not what exactly these are. Most likely, the laws are not followed by
obedience to a categorical imperative. Rather, it is assumed, that from the
very beginning the information about them is coded in submicroscopic patches of
the space-time. The initial density $\varrho_i$ is supposed to belong to the
unimpaired cosmological constant obtained from elementary particle theory. Due
to its huge value it causes an extremely fast spatial expansion by which
continuously new space-time elements are created. To them, the information
about the physical laws must be transmitted from the already present
space-time. This process needs time which with ever-increasing expansion
velocity is getting scarcer and scarcer. It is concluded that this impedes the
expansion through a friction-like process which can be described by a term
proportional to the expansion-velocity. This term is subtracted from the
expansion-acceleration. It is shown that the solutions thus obtained are also
solutions of the cosmological standard equations employing a scalar field
$\Phi$. In consequence, the present model can be considered as a
re-interpretation of results which can be obtained with acknowledged methods.

orbifolds for the ""trivial"" defect TQFT associated to vect, (ii) $G$-crossed
extensions of $\mathcal{C}$ give group orbifolds for any finite group $G$, and
(iii) we construct orbifolds from commutative $\Delta$-separable symmetric
Frobenius algebras in $\mathcal{C}$. We also explain how the Turaev-Viro state
sum construction fits into our framework by proving that it is isomorphic to
the orbifold of case (i). Moreover, we treat the cases (ii) and (iii) in the
more general setting of ribbon tensor categories. For case (ii) we show how
Morita equivalence leads to isomorphic orbifolds, and we discuss
Tambara-Yamagami categories as particular examples.

aim at retrieving the community structure directly. The paper shows that
communities can be detected by applying a spectral method to the covariance

performance depends on a `low-pass' property of the graph filter. We also show
that the performance can be improved via a low-rank matrix plus sparse
decomposition method when the latent parameter vectors are known. Numerical

investigated by exploiting the unfolding of Meijer's $G$-function when the
electrical SNR of FSO link approaches infinity. Finally, Monte-Carlo simulation

characteristics and resulting light emission properties of cavities containing
two distinct exciton sub-populations within the same semiconductor. Ultrastrong
coupling for disordered glassy-phase excitons is observed from angle-resolved
reflectivity measurements, with Rabi splitting energies in excess of 1.05 eV

introduction of $\beta$-phase excitons and increases with their growing

polariton branch, allowing conformational control to be exerted over the
emission energy and its angular variation. Dispersion-free cavities with highly
saturated blue-violet emission are thus enabled. Experimental results are
discussed in terms of the full Hopfield Hamiltonian generalized to the case of
two exciton oscillators. The importance of taking account of the molecular

support testing resource allocations by using data of the previous releases of
the same project for predicting which software components are likely to be
defective. A validation technique, hereinafter technique defines a specific way
to split available data in training and test sets to measure a classifier
accuracy. Time-series techniques have the unique ability to preserve the
temporal order of data; i.e., preventing the testing set to have data
antecedent to the training set. [Aim] The aim of this paper is twofold: first
we check if there is a difference in the classifiers accuracy measured by
time-series versus non-time-series techniques. Afterward, we check for a
possible reason for this difference, i.e., if defect rates change across
releases of a project. [Method] Our method consists of measuring the accuracy,
i.e., AUC, of 10 classifiers on 13 open and two closed projects by using three
validation techniques, namely cross validation, bootstrap, and walk-forward,
where only the latter is a time-series technique. [Results] We find that the
AUC of the same classifier used on the same project and measured by 10-fold
varies compared to when measured by walk-forward in the range [-0.20, 0.22],
and it is statistically different in 45% of the cases. Similarly, the AUC
measured by bootstrap varies compared to when measured by walk-forward in the
range [-0.17, 0.43], and it is statistically different in 56% of the cases.
[Conclusions] We recommend choosing the technique to be used by carefully
considering the conclusions to draw, the property of the available datasets,
and the level of realism with the classifier usage scenario.

SOXS (Son Of X-Shooter) is the new wideband, medium resolution (R>4500)
spectrograph for the ESO 3.58m NTT telescope expected to start observations in
2021 at La Silla. The spectroscopic capabilities of SOXS are assured by two
different arms. The UV-VIS (350-850 nm) arm is based on a novel concept that
adopts the use of 4 ion-etched high efficiency transmission gratings. The NIR
(800- 2000 nm) arm adopts the '4C' design (Collimator Correction of Camera
Chromatism) successfully applied in X-Shooter. Other optical sub-systems are
the imaging Acquisition Camera, the Calibration Unit and a pre-slit Common
Path. We describe the optical design of the five sub-systems and report their
performance in terms of spectral format, throughput and optical quality. This
work is part of a series of contributions describing the SOXS design and
properties as it is about to face the Final Design Review.

of behaviors of liquids--splashing, squirting, gushing, sloshing, soaking,
dripping, draining, trickling, pooling, and pouring--despite tremendous
variability in their material and dynamical properties. Here we propose and
test a computational model of how people perceive and predict these liquid
dynamics, based on coarse approximate simulations of fluids as collections of
interacting particles. Our model is analogous to a ""game engine in the head"",
drawing on techniques for interactive simulations (as in video games) that
optimize for efficiency and natural appearance rather than physical accuracy.
In two behavioral experiments, we found that the model accurately captured
people's predictions about how liquids flow among complex solid obstacles, and
was significantly better than two alternatives based on simple heuristics and
deep neural networks. Our model was also able to explain how people's
predictions varied as a function of the liquids' properties (e.g., viscosity
and stickiness). Together, the model and empirical results extend the recent
proposal that human physical scene understanding for the dynamics of rigid,
solid objects can be supported by approximate probabilistic simulation, to the
more complex and unexplored domain of fluid dynamics.

state. Two-dimensional bootstrap percolation models have three rough
universality classes, the most studied being the `critical' one. For this class
the scaling of the quantity of greatest interest -- the critical probability --
was determined by Bollob\'as, Duminil-Copin, Morris and Smith in terms of a
simply defined combinatorial quantity called `difficulty', so the subject
seemed closed up to finding sharper results. However, the computation of the
difficulty, was never considered. In this paper we provide the first algorithm
to determine this quantity, which is, surprisingly, not as easy as the
definition leads to thinking. The proof also provides some explicit upper
bounds, which are of use for bootstrap percolation. On the other hand, we also
prove the negative result that computing the difficulty of a critical model is
NP-hard. This two-dimensional picture contrasts with an upcoming result of
Balister, Bollob\'as, Morris and Smith on uncomputability in higher dimensions.
The proof of NP-hardness is achieved by a technical reduction to the Set Cover

making the spectrograms complement each other. In the framework, a single CNN
architecture is applied onto multiple spectrograms for feature extraction. The
deep features extracted from multiple spectrograms are then fused to
discriminate the acoustic scenes. Moreover, motivated by the inter-class

simple algebraic and differential operators that can be applied recursively to
derive a complete set of invariants starting from the basic known local and
nonlocal invariants are constructed. Second, these operators are used to derive
infinite hierarchies of local and nonlocal invariants for both adiabatic fluids
and isentropic fluids that are either incompressible, or compressible with
barotropic and non-barotropic equations of state. Each hierarchy is complete in
the sense that no further invariants can be generated from the basic local and
nonlocal invariants. All of the resulting new invariants are related to Ertel's
invariant, the Ertel-Rossby invariant, and Hollmann's invariant. In particular,
for incompressible fluid flow in which the density is non-constant across
different fluid streamlines, a new variant of Ertel's invariant and several new
variants of Hollmann's invariant are derived, where the entropy gradient is
replaced by the density gradient. Third, the physical meaning of these new

the RV technique. Despite many efforts in trying to mitigate the effect of
stellar activity using empirical and statistical techniques, it seems that we
are facing an obstacle that will be extremely difficult to overcome using
current techniques. In this paper, we investigate a novel approach to derive
precise RVs considering the wealth of information present in high-resolution
spectra. This new method consists in building a master spectrum from all
observations and measure the RVs of each spectral line in a spectrum relative
to it. When analysing several spectra, the final product is the RVs of each
line as a function of time. We demonstrate on three stars intensively observed
with HARPS that our new method gives RVs that are extremely similar to the ones
derived from the HARPS data reduction software. Our new approach to derive RVs
demonstrates that the non-stability of daily HARPS wavelength solution induces
night-to-night RV offsets with an standard deviation of 0.4 m/s, and we propose
a solution to correct for this systematic. Finally, and this is probably the
most astrophysically relevant result of this paper, we demonstrate that some
spectral lines are strongly affected by stellar activity while others are not.
By measuring the RVs on two carefully selected subsample of spectral lines, we
demonstrate that we can boost by a factor of 2 or mitigate by a factor of 1.6
the red noise induced by stellar activity in the 2010 RVs of Alpha Cen B. By
measuring the RVs of each spectral line, we are able to reach the same RV
precision as other approved techniques. In addition, this new approach allows
to demonstrate that each line is differently affected by stellar activity.
Preliminary results show that studying in details the behaviour of each
spectral line is probably the key to overcome stellar activity.

based on the standard AM1.5G spectrum, but in practice, the incident radiation
on a solar cell can be very different from this standard due to the effects of
the sun's location in the sky, atmospheric conditions, total diffuse element
etc. The resulting deviations in spectral content from optimum conditions lead
to current mismatch between tandem cell layers that adversely affects the
device's performance. To investigate the impact of this issue the energy yield
(%) of tandem solar cells comprising a III-V wide-bandgap solar cell connected
electrically and optically in series with a silicon bottom cell was simulated
over a full year using measured spectral data from Denver, CO. Top cells with
bandgaps from 1.5-1.9 eV were modelled using an external radiative efficiency
method. The predicted annual energy yields were as high as 31% with an optimum
1.8 eV top cell, only 2.8% lower (absolute) than the AM1.5G predicted
efficiency. The annual energy yield of tandem cells with no current-matching
constraint, i.e. parallel-connected devices, was also simulated. Here the
difference between series and parallel connections were only significant for
non-optimum bandgap combinations. Our results indicate that AM1.5G based
optimization of sub-cells can be effectively employed to achieve high energy
yields of >25% for III-V/Si tandem solar cells in mid-latitude US locations,

regardless of student gender or ethnic group. Given the highly interactive

further explore students' changes in self-efficacy as a function of three
centrality measures (i.e., relational positions in the classroom social

by periodically asking students to list the names of peers with whom they had
meaningful interactions. While controlling for PRE scores on the SOSESC-P,
bootstrapped linear regressions revealed post-self-efficacy scores to be
predicted by PageRank centrality. When disaggregated by the sources of
self-efficacy, PageRank centrality was shown to be directly related to

be modeled as a sequence of linear motions and compliances. The focus of this
paper is the learning of a single linear primitive, many of which can be
sequenced to perform more complex tasks. The presented method learns from
demonstrations only, without any prior information, how to take advantage of
mechanical gradients in in-contact tasks, such as assembly, both for
translations and rotations. The method assumes there exists a desired linear
direction in 6-D which, if followed by the manipulator, leads the robot's
end-effector to the goal area shown in the demonstration, either in free space
or by leveraging contact through compliance. First, demonstrations are gathered
where the teacher explicitly shows the robot how the mechanical gradients can
be used as guidance towards the goal. From the demonstrations, a set of
directions is computed which would result in the observed motion at each
timestep during a demonstration of a single primitive. By observing which
direction is included in all these sets, we find a single desired direction
which can reproduce the demonstrated motion. Finding the number of compliant
axes and their directions in both rotation and translation is based on the
assumption that in the presence of a desired direction of motion, all other
observed motion is caused by the contact force of the environment, signalling
the need for compliance. We evaluate the method on a KUKA LWR4+ robot with test
setups imitating typical tasks where a human would use compliance to cope with
positional uncertainty. Results show that the method can successfully learn and
reproduce compliant motions by taking advantage of the geometry of the task,
therefore reducing the need for localization accuracy.

  https://github.com/marcelampc/d3net_depth_estimation",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Depth estimation is of critical interest for scene understanding and accurate
3D reconstruction. Most recent approaches in depth estimation with deep
learning exploit geometrical structures of standard sharp images to predict
corresponding depth maps. However, cameras can also produce images with defocus
blur depending on the depth of the objects and camera settings. Hence, these
features may represent an important hint for learning to predict depth. In this
paper, we propose a full system for single-image depth prediction in the wild
using depth-from-defocus and neural networks. We carry out thorough experiments
to test deep convolutional networks on real and simulated defocused images
using a realistic model of blur variation with respect to depth. We also
investigate the influence of blur on depth prediction observing model
uncertainty with a Bayesian neural network approach. From these studies, we
show that out-of-focus blur greatly improves the depth-prediction network
performances. Furthermore, we transfer the ability learned on a synthetic,
indoor dataset to real, indoor and outdoor images. For this purpose, we present
a new dataset containing real all-focus and defocused images from a Digital
Single-Lens Reflex (DSLR) camera, paired with ground truth depth maps obtained
with an active 3D sensor for indoor scenes. The proposed approach is
successfully validated on both this new dataset and standard ones as NYUv2 or
Depth-in-the-Wild. Code and new datasets are available at

cases that are infeasible, system configurations that have no solution. In this
paper, we use the circuit theoretic approach based on adjoint networks to
evaluate the feasibility of a power flow test case and further locate and
quantify the source of infeasibility in the cases operating beyond the tip of
the nose curve. By creating infeasibility current source models that are added
to each node of the system model and further coupling each source to its
corresponding node of the adjoint network, any locations of insufficient real
or reactive power are captured by a non-zero response of the adjoint network.
Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed joint simulation of power flow and
its adjoint network models provide the optimally minimized currents that can be
later utilized to inform corrective actions to restore the feasibility of power
flow problems.

programming results with the degree of certainty that is required for

relies on a rational branch-and-bound certificate produced by an exact integer
programming solver, SCIP, in order to circumvent floating-point roundoff errors
present in most state-of-the-art solvers for mixed-integer programs. The
resulting certificates are self-contained and checker software exists that can
verify their correctness independently of the integer programming solver used
to produce the certificate. This acts as a safeguard against programming errors
that may be present in complex solver software. The viability of this approach
is tested by applying it to finite cases of Chv\'atal's conjecture, a
long-standing open question in extremal combinatorics. We take particular care
to verify also the correctness of the input for this specific problem, using
the Coq formal proof assistant. As a result, we are able to provide a first
machine-assisted proof that Chv\'atal's conjecture holds for all downsets whose
union of sets contains seven elements or less.

Auger analysis, we did not optimize the parameter values but kept them fixed to
the best-fit values found by Auger, namely 9.7% for the anisotropic fraction of
cosmic rays assumed to originate from the SBGs in the list and 12.9{\deg} for
the angular scale of the correlations. The energy threshold we adopted is 43
EeV, corresponding to 39 EeV in Auger when taking into account the energy-scale
difference between two experiments. We find that the TA data is compatible with
isotropy to within 1.1{\sigma} and with the Auger result to within 1.4{\sigma},
meaning that it is not capable to discriminate between these two hypotheses.

modelling the point spread function (PSF), which captures the optical
distortions entailed by the image formation process. The PSF limits the spatial
resolution attainable for a given microscope. However, recent applications
require a higher resolution, and have prompted the development of
super-resolution techniques to achieve sub-pixel accuracy. This requirement
restricts the class of suitable PSF models to analog ones. In addition,
deblurring is computationally intensive, hence further requiring
computationally efficient models. A custom candidate fitting both requirements
is the Gaussian model. However, this model cannot capture the rich tail
structures found in both theoretical and empirical PSFs. In this paper, we aim
at improving the reconstruction accuracy beyond the Gaussian model, while
preserving its computational efficiency. We introduce a new class of analog PSF
models based on Gaussian mixtures. The number of Gaussian kernels controls both
the modelling accuracy and the computational efficiency of the model: the lower
the number of kernels, the lower accuracy and the higher efficiency. To explore
the accuracy--efficiency trade-off, we propose a variational formulation of the
PSF calibration problem, where a convex sparsity-inducing penalty on the number
of Gaussian kernels allows trading accuracy for efficiency. We derive an
efficient algorithm based on a fully-split formulation of alternating split
Bregman. We assess our framework on synthetic and real data and demonstrate a
better reconstruction accuracy in both geometry and photometry in point source

agent-infant interaction. The ultimate purpose of this research is to help
infants learn a visual sign language by engaging them in naturalistic and
socially contingent conversations during an early-life critical period for
language development (ages 6 to 12 months) as initiated by an artificial agent.
As a first step, we focus on creating and maintaining agent-infant engagement
that elicits appropriate and socially contingent responses from the baby. Our
system includes two agents, a physical robot and an animated virtual human. The
system's multimodal perception includes an eye-tracker (measures attention) and
a thermal infrared imaging camera (measures patterns of emotional arousal). A
dialogue policy is presented that selects individual actions and planned
multiparty sequences based on perceptual inputs about the baby's internal
changing states of emotional engagement. The present version of the system was
evaluated in interaction with 8 babies. All babies demonstrated spontaneous and
sustained engagement with the agents for several minutes, with patterns of
conversationally relevant and socially contingent behaviors. We further
performed a detailed case-study analysis with annotation of all agent and baby
behaviors. Results show that the baby's behaviors were generally relevant to
agent conversations and contained direct evidence for socially contingent
responses by the baby to specific linguistic samples produced by the avatar.
This work demonstrates the potential for language learning from agents in very
young babies and has especially broad implications regarding the use of
artificial agents with babies who have minimal language exposure in early life.

central processing unit (CPU) gathers measurements of the Rician
$K$-factor---reflecting the line-of-sight (LOS) condition of the user equipment
(UE)---as well as the DL reference signal receive power (RSRP) for both 2.6 GHz

(SVM) algorithm. The CPU finally stops the measurements of mmWave definitely,
and apply the trained SVM algorithm on the 2.6 GHz data to blindly predict the
target frequencies and access points (APs) that can be independently used for
the UL and DL. The accuracy score of the proposed classifier reaches $95\%$ for
few training samples.

advances in dynamic AFM methodologies. A calibration factor is required to
convert the electrical readout to a mechanical oscillation amplitude in order
to extract quantitative information about the surface. We propose a new
calibration technique for the oscillation amplitude of electrically driven
probes, which is based on measuring the electrical energy input to maintain the
oscillation amplitude constant. We demonstrate the application of the new
technique with quartz tuning fork including the qPlus configuration, while the
same principle can be applied to other piezoelectric resonators such as length
extension resonators, or piezoelectric cantilevers. The calibration factor
obtained by this technique is found to be in agreement with using thermal noise
spectrum method for capsulated, decapsulated tuning forks and tuning forks in
the qPlus configuration.

we show that this is the case for the algebras $\mathrm{CV}_p(G)$ of
$p$-convolvers and $\mathrm{PM}_p(G)$ of $p$-pseudomeasures, for $p\neq 2$.
More generally, we show that if $\mathrm{CV}_p(G)$ is isometrically isomorphic
to $\mathrm{CV}_q(H)$, with $p,q\neq 2$, then $G$ must be isomorphic to $H$ and
$p$ and $q$ are either equal or conjugate. This implies that there is no
$L^p$-version of Connes' uniqueness of the hyperfinite II$_1$-factor. Similar
results apply to the algebra $\mathrm{PF}_p(G)$ of $p$-pseudofunctions,
generalizing a classical result of Wendel. We also show that other
$L^p$-rigidity results for groups can be easily recovered and extended using
our main theorem.
  Our results answer questions originally formulated in the work of Herz in the

allows us to predict not only the correct scalings for the elastic material
properties, but also the precise {\em magnitudes} for bulk modulus and shear
modulus discontinuities at the rigidity transition as well as the magnitude of
the Poynting effect. We also predict from first principles that the ratio of
the excess shear modulus to the shear stress should be inversely proportional
to the critical strain with a prefactor of three, and propose that this factor

dynamics of fluorescence markers along curvilinear biological compartments.
These objects have a sin- gular geometry, thus kymograph reconstruction is
inherently an analog image processing task. However, the existing approaches
are essentially digital: the kymograph photometry is sampled directly from the
time-lapse images. As a result, such kymographs rely on raw image data that
suffer from the degradations entailed by the image formation process and the
spatio-temporal resolution of the imaging setup. In this work, we address these
limitations and introduce a well-grounded Bayesian framework for the analog
reconstruction of kymographs. To handle the movement of the object, we
introduce an intrinsic description of kymographs using differential geometry: a
kymograph is a photometry defined on a parameter space that is embedded in
physical space by a time-varying map that follows the object geometry. We model
the kymograph photometry as a L\'evy innovation process, a flexible class of
non-parametric signal priors. We account for the image formation process using
the virtual microscope framework. We formulate a computationally tractable
representation of the associated maximum a posteriori problem and solve it
using a class of efficient and modular algorithms based on the alternating
split Bregman. We assess the performance of our Bayesian framework on synthetic
data and apply it to reconstruct the fluorescence dynamics along microtubules
in vivo in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae. We demonstrate that our framework
allows revealing patterns from single time-lapse data that are invisible on
standard digital kymographs.

performed with Sentinel-1 allow other research the ability to redo the
experiments and either validate or falsify presented findings. Based on current
state-of-art research we have chosen to provide a service for researchers in

local conditions by using the Sentinel-1 information combined with a priori
knowledge from broad acre fields. Correlating processed Sentinel-1 to the
actual conditions is still a task the individual researchers must perform to
benefit from the service. In this paper, we presented our methodology in
translating sentinel-1 data to a level that is more accessible to researchers
in the agricultural field. The goal here was to make the data more easily
available, so the primary focus can be on correlating and comparing to
measurements collected in the broadacre fields. We illustrate the value of the
service with three examples of the possible application areas. The presented
application examples are all based on Denmark, where we have processed all

Medicaid and healthcare audits. The goal of these audits is to examine a
population of claims submitted by a healthcare provider for reimbursement by a
third party payer to determine the total amount of money which is erroneously
claimed. For large audit populations, conclusions about the total amount of
reimbursement claimed erroneously are often based on sample data. Often, sample
size determination must be made in the absence of pilot study data and existing
methods for doing so typically rely on restrictive assumptions. This includes
the `all-or-nothing errors' assumption which assumes the error in a claim is
either the entire claim amount or none of it. Under the all-or-nothing errors
assumption, Roberts (1978) has derived estimates of the variances needed for
sample size calculations under simple expansion and ratio estimation. Some
audit populations, however, will contain claims which are partially in error.
We broaden existing methodology to handle this scenario by proposing an error
model which allows for partial errors by modeling the line-item error
mechanism. We use this model to derive estimates of the variances needed for
sample size determination under simple expansion and ratio estimation in the
presence of partial errors. In the absence of certain error-rate parameter
estimates needed to implement our method, we show that conservative sample
sizes can be determined using the claim data alone. We further show that, under
all-or-nothing errors, ratio estimation will tend to outperform simple
expansion and that optimal stratification is independent of the population
error rate under ratio estimation. The proposed sample design methods are
illustrated on three simulated audit populations.

chronological spacetimes that satisfy what we call a `past null focusing'
condition. Such a condition forces all null geodesics with future endpoint to
develop a pair of conjugate points if past complete. By the Einstein field
equations, such a condition will be satisfied if the density of matter fields
remains sufficiently high towards the past of the spacetime, as may be expected
in certain cosmological scenarios. The theorem obtained doesn't make starting
assumptions about the spacetime's topology, such as the existence of a compact
achronal slice, and if in addition to a `past null focusing' condition we
assume the timelike convergence condition, then further consequences pertaining
to the existence of CMC foliations and the character of the singularity are
obtained. With the addition of the timelike convergence condition, we obtain
the conclusion that all timelike geodesics are past incomplete, which is much
stronger than the usual single incomplete non-spacelike geodesic.

renting out single rooms or whole apartments. The impact of Airbnb listings on
local neighborhoods has been controversially discussed in many cities around
the world. The platform's widespread adoption led to changes in urban life, and
in particular urban tourism. We argue that urban tourism space can no longer be
understood as a fixed, spatial entity. Instead, we follow a constructionist
approach and argue that urban tourism space is (re-)produced digitally and
collaboratively on online platforms such as Airbnb. We relate our work to a
CSCW research direction that is concerned with the role of digital technologies
in the production and appropriation of urban space and use the concept of
representations as a theoretical lens for our empirical study. In that study,
we qualitatively analyzed how the two Berlin neighborhoods Kreuzk\""olln and
City West are digitally constructed by Airbnb hosts in their listing
descriptions. Moreover, we quantitatively investigated to what extend mentioned
places differ between Airbnb hosts and visitBerlin, the city's destination
management organization (DMO). In our qualitative analysis, we found that hosts
primarily focus on facilities and places in close proximity to their apartment.
In the traditional urban tourism hotspot City West, hosts referred to many
places also mentioned by the DMO. In the neighborhood of Kreuzk\""olln, in
contrast, hosts reframed everyday places such as parks or an immigrant food
market as the must sees in the area. We discuss how Airbnb hosts contribute to
the discursive production of urban neighborhoods and thus co-produce them as
tourist destinations. With the emergence of online platforms such as Airbnb,
power relations in the construction of tourism space might shift from DMOs
towards local residents who are now producing tourism space collaboratively.

high-efficiency power-to-gas, which mitigates the renewable curtailment by
transforming wind or solar energy into fuels. Different from low-temperature
electrolysis, a considerable amount of the input energy is consumed by
auxiliaries in an HTE system for maintaining the temperature, so the studies on
systematic description and parameter optimization of HTE are essentially
required. A few published studies investigated HTE's systematic optimization
based on simulation, yet there is not a commonly used analytical optimization
model which is more suitable for integration with power grid. To fill in this
blank, a concise analytical operation model is proposed in this paper to
coordinate the necessary power consumptions of auxiliaries under various
loading conditions of an HTE system. First, this paper develops a comprehensive
energy flow model for an HTE system based on the fundamentals extracted from
the existing work, providing a quantitative description of the impacts of
condition parameters, including the temperature and the feedstock flow rates. A
concise operation model is then analytically proposed to search for the optimal
operating states that maximize the hydrogen yield while meeting the desired
system loading power by coordinating the temperature, the feedstock flows and
the electrolysis current. The evaluation of system performance and the
consideration of constraints caused by energy balances and necessary stack
requirements are both included. In addition, analytical optimality conditions
are obtained to locate the optimal states without performing nonlinear
programming by further investigating the optimization method. A numerical case
of an HTE system is employed to validate the proposed operation model, which
proves to not only improve the conversion efficiency but also enlarge the

  minimized batch effect","30 Pages, 8 figures, 6 tables",,"10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.09.194",,"physics.app-ph cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Values of water permeability for cementitious materials reported in the
literature show a large scatter. This is partially attributed to the fact that
materials used in different studies are different. To eliminate the effects of
cements, specimen preparation, curing conditions and other batch effects, this
study employs a long cylindrical cement paste to prepare all specimens for a
variety of permeability determination methods, such as beam bending,
sorptivity, Katz Thompson and Kozeny Carman equations. Permeabilities
determined by these methods are then used in a moisture transport model.
Compared with the measured mass loss curves, we found that permeability
determined by the beam bending method provides much closer results to the
measured ones than other methods. The difference results from that the
saturated specimen is used in the beam bending method while specimens in other
methods are dried (or rewetted). As already shown in the literature, the
microstructure of the dried or rewetted specimens is altered and different to
the original microstructure of the water saturated specimens.

  Years",,,,,"q-fin.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Little is known about how different types of advertising affect brand
attitudes. We investigate the relationships between three brand attitude
variables (perceived quality, perceived value and recent satisfaction) and
three types of advertising (national traditional, local traditional and
digital). The data represent ten million brand attitude surveys and $264
billion spent on ads by 575 regular advertisers over a five-year period,
approximately 37% of all ad spend measured between 2008 and 2012. Inclusion of
brand/quarter fixed effects and industry/week fixed effects brings parameter
estimates closer to expectations without major reductions in estimation
precision. The findings indicate that (i) national traditional ads increase
perceived quality, perceived value, and recent satisfaction; (ii) local
traditional ads increase perceived quality and perceived value; (iii) digital
ads increase perceived value; and (iv) competitor ad effects are generally
negative.

avenue for low power spike event based computation. However, the spike
generation function is non-differentiable and therefore not directly compatible
with the standard error backpropagation algorithm. In this paper, we introduce
a new general backpropagation mechanism for learning synaptic weights and
axonal delays which overcomes the problem of non-differentiability of the spike
function and uses a temporal credit assignment policy for backpropagating error
to preceding layers. We describe and release a GPU accelerated software
implementation of our method which allows training both fully connected and
convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. Using our software, we
compare our method against existing SNN based learning approaches and standard
ANN to SNN conversion techniques and show that our method achieves state of the
art performance for an SNN on the MNIST, NMNIST, DVS Gesture, and TIDIGITS
datasets.
