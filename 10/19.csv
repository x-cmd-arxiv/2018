$\min\left\{\frac{4}{3}\dim_{\mathcal{H}}(E)-\frac{2}{3}-\epsilon, 1\right\}$,

stabilizability of discrete-time parameterized uncertain systems. Contrary to
an intuition, it shows that the growth rate of a discrete-time stabilizable
system with linear parameterization is not necessarily to be small all the
time. More specifically, to achieve the stabilizability, the system function
$f(x)=O(|x|^b)$ with $b<4$ is only required for a very tiny fraction of $x$ in
$\mathbb{R}$, even if it grows exponentially fast for the other $x$. The
proportion of the mentioned set in $\mathbb{R}$, where the system fulfills the
growth rate $ O(|x|^b)$ has also been computed, for both the stabilizable and
unstabilizable cases. This proportion, as indicated herein, could be
arbitrarily small, while the corresponding system is stabilizable.

low-energy regime of Quantum Gravity. Defining the microcausality relations of
a scalar quantum field theory on the $\kappa$-Minkowski noncommutative
spacetime allows us to define for the first time a notion of light-cone in a
quantum spacetime. This allows us to reach two conclusions. First, the majority
of the literature on $\kappa$-Minkowski suggests that this spacetime allows
superluminal propagation of particles. The structure of the light-cone we
introduced allows to rule this out, thereby excluding the possibility of
constraining the relevant models with observations of in-vacuo dispersion of
Gamma Ray Burst photons. Second, we are able to reject a claim made in [Phys.

$\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime has a ""blurry"" region of Planck-length thickness,
independently of the distance of the two events considered. Such an effect
would be hopeless to measure. Our analysis reveals that the thickness of the
region where the notion of timelike and spacelike separations blurs grows like
the square root of the distance. This magnifies the effect, e.g. in the case of
cosmological distances, by 30 orders of magnitude.

high-level semantic features of texts, and finds the subtle distribution
differences in the semantic space before and after embedding the secret

large text steganalysis(CT-Steg) dataset, which contains a total number of
216,000 texts with various lengths and various embedding rates. Experimental
results show that the proposed model can achieve nearly 100\% precision and

can even estimate the capacity of the hidden information inside. These results
strongly support that using the subtle changes in the semantic space before and
after embedding the secret information to conduct text steganalysis is feasible

heterogeneity are being increasingly used in biostatistical and applied
research. Specifically, unmeasured covariates whose lack of inclusion in the
model would lead to biased, inefficient results are commonly modelled by
including a subject-specific (or cluster-specific) frailty term that follows a
given distribution (e.g. Gamma or log-Normal). Despite that, in the context of
parametric frailty models little is known about the impact of misspecifying the
baseline hazard, the frailty distribution, or both. Therefore, our aim is to
quantify the impact of such misspecification in a wide variety of clinically
plausible scenarios via Monte Carlo simulation, using open source software
readily available to applied researchers. We generate clustered survival data
assuming various baseline hazard functions, including mixture distributions
with turning points, and assess the impact of sample size, variance of the
frailty, baseline hazard function, and frailty distribution. Models compared
include standard parametric distributions and more flexible spline-based
approaches; we also included semiparametric Cox models. The resulting bias can
be clinically relevant. In conclusion, we highlight the importance of fitting
models that are flexible enough and the importance of assessing model fit. We
illustrate our conclusions with two applications using data on diabetic
retinopathy and bladder cancer. Our results show the importance of assessing
model fit with respect to the baseline hazard function and the distribution of
the frailty: misspecifying the former leads to biased relative and absolute
risk estimates while misspecifying the latter affects absolute risk estimates
and measures of heterogeneity.

Weyl$^2$ plus Einstein supergravity theory is a special kind of a bimetric
gravity theory and consists of a massless graviton multiplet plus an additional
massive spin-two supermultiplet. Here, we argue that the additional spin-two
field and its superpartners originate from massive excitations in the open
string sector; just like the ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills gauge fields, they
are localized on the world volume of D3-branes. The ghost structure of the Weyl
action should be considered as an artifact of the truncation of the infinitely
many higher derivative terms underlying the massive spin 2 action. In field
theory, ${\cal N}=4$ Weyl$^2$ supergravity exhibits superconformal invariance
in the limit of vanishing Planck mass. In string theory the additional spin-two
fields become massless in the tensionless limit. Therefore low string scale
scenarios with large extra dimensions provide (almost) superconformal field
theories with almost massless open string spin-two fields. The full ${\cal
N}=4$ scalar potential including the Yang-Mills matter multiplets is presented
and the supersymmetric vacua of Einstein Supergravity are shown, as expected,
to be vacua of massive Weyl supergravity. Other vacua are expected to exist
which are not vacua of Einstein supergravity. Finally, we identify certain
spin-four operators on the 4-dimensional boundary theory that could be the
holographic duals of spin-four fields in the bulk.

multistationarity of chemical reaction networks. A particular focus is on the
case of reaction networks whose steady states admit a monomial parametrization.
For such systems we show that in the space of total concentrations
multistationarity is scale invariant: if there is multistationarity for some
value of the total concentrations, then there is multistationarity on the
entire ray containing this value (possibly for different rate constants) -- and
vice versa. Moreover, for these networks it is possible to decide about
multistationarity independent of the rate constants by formulating
semi-algebraic conditions that involve only concentration variables. These
conditions can easily be extended to include total concentrations. Hence
quantifier elimination may give new insights into multistationarity regions in
the space of total concentrations. To demonstrate this, we show that for the
distributive phosphorylation of a protein at two binding sites
multistationarity is only possible if the total concentration of the substrate
is larger than either the total concentration of the kinase or the total
concentration of the phosphatase. This result is enabled by the chamber
decomposition of the space of total concentrations from polyhedral geometry.
Together with the corresponding sufficiency result of Bihan et al. this yields
a characterization of multistationarity up to lower dimensional regions.

substantially reduce exploration of sub-optimal arms. This approach enables us

pulls only a subset of the sub-optimal arms $O(\log T)$ times while the other
sub-optimal arms (referred to as non-competitive arms) are pulled $O(1)$ times.
As a result, in cases where all sub-optimal arms are non-competitive, which can
happen in many practical scenarios, the proposed algorithms achieve bounded
regret. We also conduct simulations on the Movielens recommendations dataset to

required to measure image quality efficiently and reliably. The neglect of the

bad quality, which is inconsistent with human perception. Therefore, in this
paper, we tackle this problem by exploiting the high-level semantics and
propose a novel no-reference image quality assessment method for realistic blur
images. Firstly, the whole image is divided into multiple overlapping patches.
Secondly, each patch is represented by the high-level feature extracted from
the pre-trained deep convolutional neural network model. Thirdly, three
different kinds of statistical structures are adopted to aggregate the
information from different patches, which mainly contain some common statistics
(i.e., the mean\&standard deviation, quantiles and moments). Finally, the
aggregated features are fed into a linear regression model to predict the image
quality. Experiments show that, compared with low-level features, high-level
features indeed play a more critical role in resolving the aforementioned
challenging problem for quality estimation. Besides, the proposed method
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two realistic blur
image databases and achieves comparable performance on two synthetic blur image
databases.

This improves upon the previous $O(d^2/\epsilon^2)$ bound (SODA'03), and
bypasses an $\Omega(d^2/\epsilon^2)$ lower bound of (KDD'14) which holds if the
algorithm is required to read a submatrix. Our algorithm is the first such
algorithm which does not read a submatrix, and instead reads a carefully
selected non-adaptive pattern of entries in rows and columns of $A$. We
complement our algorithm with a matching query complexity lower bound for
non-adaptive testers over any field. We also give tight bounds of
$\widetilde{\Theta}(d^2)$ queries in the sensing model for which query access
comes in the form of $\langle X_i, A\rangle:=tr(X_i^\top A)$; perhaps
surprisingly these bounds do not depend on $\epsilon$.
  We next develop a novel property testing framework for testing numerical
properties of a real-valued matrix $A$ more generally, which includes the
stable rank, Schatten-$p$ norms, and SVD entropy. Specifically, we propose a
bounded entry model, where $A$ is required to have entries bounded by $1$ in

quantitatively reproduces the rates of medium-induced parton splitting

over tasks in meta-learning. The goal of meta-learning is to learn a model for
an agent adapting rapidly when presented with previously unseen tasks. Tasks
are sampled from a specific distribution which is assumed to be similar for
both seen and unseen tasks. We focus on a family of meta-learning methods
learning initial parameters of a base model which can be fine-tuned quickly on
a new task, by few gradient steps (MAML). Our approach is based on pushing the
parameters of the model to a direction in which tasks have more agreement upon.
If the gradients of a task agree with the parameters update vector, then their
inner product will be a large positive value. As a result, given a batch of
tasks to be optimized for, we associate a positive (negative) weight to the
loss function of a task, if the inner product between its gradients and the
average of the gradients of all tasks in the batch is a positive (negative)
value. Therefore, the degree of the contribution of a task to the parameter
updates is controlled by introducing a set of weights on the loss function of
the tasks. Our method can be easily integrated with the current meta-learning
algorithms for neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that it yields
models with better generalization compared to MAML and Reptile.

resemble the near criticality region of the Ising model. In the special case of
the vanishing magnetic field the trained RBM converges to the critical point of
the Renormalization Group (RG) flow of the lattice model. Our results suggest
an alternative explanation of how the machine identifies the physical phase

Now, suppose that additional vacancies (""holes"", or ""impurities"") are created,
independently, with some small probability, i.e. the parameter $p_c$ is
replaced by $p_c - \varepsilon$, for some small $\varepsilon > 0$. A celebrated
result by Kesten says, informally speaking, that on scales below the
characteristic length $L(p_c - \varepsilon)$, the connection probabilities
remain of the same order as before. We prove a substantial and subtle
generalization to the case where the impurities are not only microscopic, but
allowed to be ""mesoscopic"".
  This generalization, which is also interesting in itself, was motivated by
our study of models of forest fires (or epidemics). In these models, all
vertices are initially vacant, and then become occupied at rate $1$. If an
occupied vertex is hit by lightning, which occurs at a (typically very small)
rate $\zeta$, its entire occupied cluster burns immediately, so that all its
vertices become vacant.
  Our results for percolation with impurities turn out to be crucial for
analyzing the behavior of these forest fire models near and beyond the critical
time (i.e. the time after which, in a forest without fires, an infinite cluster
of trees emerges). In particular, we prove (so far, for the case when burnt
trees do not recover) the existence of a sequence of ""exceptional scales""

of fires does not vanish in the limit as $\zeta \searrow 0$.

interesting features of the Ly{\alpha} line can be understood in terms of the
galaxy's star formation history. The time variability, spatial morphology, and
anisotropy of Ly{\alpha} properties are consistent with current observations.
For example, the rest frame equivalent width has a ${\rm EW}_{{\rm Ly}\alpha,0}
> 20 {\rm \AA}$ duty cycle of 62% with a non-negligible number of sightlines
with $> 100 {\rm \AA}$, associated with outflowing regions of a starburst with
greater coincident UV continuum absorption, as these conditions generate
redder, narrower (or single peaked) line profiles. The lowest equivalent widths
correspond to cosmological filaments, which have little impact on UV continuum
photons but efficiently trap Ly{\alpha} and produce bluer, broader lines with
less transmission through the IGM. We also show that in dense self-shielding,
low-metallicity filaments and satellites Ly{\alpha} radiation pressure can be
dynamically important. Finally, despite a significant reduction in surface

further discriminating characteristic. These properties give rise to a wide
range of distinct semimetal phases such as Dirac or Weyl semimetals, point or
line node semimetals, and type-I or type-II semimetals. In this review we give
a general description of various families of topological semimetals with an
emphasis on proposed material realizations from first-principles calculations.
The conceptual framework for studying topological gapless electronic phases is
reviewed, with a particular focus on the symmetry requirements of energy band
crossings, and the relation between the different families of topological
semimetals is elucidated. In addition to the paradigmatic Dirac and Weyl
semimetals, we pay particular attention to more recent examples of topological
semimetals, which include nodal line semimetals, multifold fermion semimetals,
triple-point semimetals. Less emphasis is placed on their surface state
properties, responses to external probes, and recent experimental developments.

during low-traffic periods, in order to reduce the delivery load during
peak-traffic hours. In turn, there exists a fundamental trade-off between the
delivery load on the server and the cache sizes at the users. In this paper, we
study this trade-off in a multicast network where the server is connected to
users with unequal cache sizes and the number of users is less than or equal to
the number of library files. We propose centralized uncoded placement and
linear delivery schemes which are optimized by solving a linear program.
Additionally, we derive a lower bound on the delivery memory trade-off with
uncoded placement that accounts for the heterogeneity in cache sizes. We
explicitly characterize this trade-off for the case of three end-users, as well
as an arbitrary number of end-users when the total memory size at the users is
small, and when it is large. Next, we consider a system where the server is
connected to the users via rate limited links of different capacities and the
server assigns the users' cache sizes subject to a total cache budget. We
characterize the optimal cache sizes that minimize the delivery completion time
with uncoded placement and linear delivery. In particular, the optimal memory
allocation balances between assigning larger cache sizes to users with low
capacity links and uniform memory allocation.

model learns the specific nature of sequences for different types of objects

visibility domains with respect to the Kobayashi distance. We provide a

visibility in the context of CAT(0) spaces. However, this is an imperfect
analogy because, given a bounded domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{C}^n$, $n\geq 2$,
it is, in general, not even known whether the metric space $(\Omega,{\sf

stellar companions through the single-degenerate channel have reigned for
decades as the leading explanation of Type Ia supernovae. Yet, a comprehensive
theoretical explanation has not yet emerged to explain the expected properties
of the canonical near-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf model. A simmering phase
within the convective core of the white dwarf leads to the ignition of one or
more flame bubbles scattered across the core. Consequently,
near-Chandrasekhar-mass single-degenerate SNe Ia are inherently stochastic, and
are expected to lead to a range of outcomes, from subluminous SN 2002cx-like
events, to overluminous SN 1991T-like events. However, all prior simulations of
the single-degenerate channel carried through the detonation phase have set the
ignition points as free parameters. In this work, for the first time, we place
ignition points as predicted by {\it ab initio} models of the convective phase
leading up to ignition, and follow through the detonation phase in fully
three-dimensional simulations. Single-degenerates in this framework are
characteristically overluminous. Using a statistical approach, we determine the
$^{56}$Ni mass distribution arising from stochastic ignition. While there is a
total spread of $\gtrsim 0.2 M_{\odot}$ for detonating models, the distribution
is strongly left-skewed, and with a narrow standard deviation of $\simeq 0.03
M_{\odot}$. Conversely, if single-degenerates are not overluminous but
primarily yield normal or failed events, then the models require fine-tuning of
the ignition parameters, or otherwise require revised physics or progenitor
models. We discuss implications of our findings for the modeling of
single-degenerate SNe Ia.

history and metallicity evolution of the Milky Way, we analyze the evolution of
binaries containing compact objects (COs) in orbit around GSs with properties
similar to 2M0521. We find ~100-1000 CO-GS binaries in the Milky Way observable

analogs to white dwarf post-CE binaries. We further show how the component
masses of 2M0521-like binaries depend strongly on the supernova-engine model we

radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of two molecular clouds self-consistently
forming from a turbulent, multi-phase ISM. The clouds have similar initial
masses of few 10$^4$ M$_{\odot}$, escape velocities of ~5 km s$^{-1}$, and a
similar initial energy budget. We follow the formation of star clusters with a
sink based model and the impact of radiation from individual massive stars with
the tree-based radiation transfer module TreeRay. Photo-ionizing radiation is
coupled to a chemical network to follow gas heating, cooling and molecule
formation and dissociation. For the first 3 Myr of cloud evolution we find that
the overall star formation effciency is considerably reduced by a factor of ~4
to global cloud values of < 10 % as the mass accretion of sinks that host
massive stars is terminated after <1 Myr. Despite the low effciency, star
formation is triggered across the clouds. Therefore, a much larger region of
the cloud is affected by radiation and the clouds begin to disperse. The time
scale on which the clouds are dispersed sensitively depends on the cloud
substructure and in particular on the amount of gas at high visual extinction.
The damage of radiation done to the highly shielded cloud (MC1) is delayed. We
also show that the radiation input can sustain the thermal and kinetic energy
of the clouds at a constant level. Our results strongly support the importance
of ionizing radiation from massive stars for explaining the low observed star
formation effciency of molecular clouds

observational constraints on key observables related to the EoR, such as the
midpoint and duration of reionization. Although upcoming observations of the 21
cm power spectrum with next-generation radio interferometers such as the
Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) and the Square Kilometre Array
(SKA) are expected to provide information about the midpoint of reionization
readily, extracting the duration from the power spectrum alone is a more
difficult proposition. As an alternative method for extracting information
about reionization, we present an application of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) to images of reionization. These images are two-dimensional in the plane
of the sky, and extracted at a series of redshift values to generate ""image
cubes"" that are qualitatively similar to those of the HERA and the SKA will
generate in the near future. Additionally, we include the impact that the
bright foreground signal from the the Milky Way imparts on such image cubes
from interferometers, but do not include the noise induced from observations.
We show that we are able to recover the duration of reionization $\Delta$z to
within 5% using CNNs, assuming that the midpoint of reionization is already
relatively well constrained. These results have exciting impacts for estimating
$\tau$, the optical depth to the cosmic microwave background, which can help
constrain other cosmological parameters.

accreting satellites as the fossil parameter increases and the scale radius

Carnegie Supernova Project-II (CSP-II), to follow up nearby SNe Ia in both the
optical and the NIR. In particular, this paper focuses on the CSP-II NIR
spectroscopy program, describing the survey strategy, instrumental setups, data
reduction, sample characteristics, and future analyses on the data set. In
collaboration with the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA)

451 NIR spectra of 90 SNe Ia have corresponding CSP-II follow-up light curves.
Such a sample will allow detailed studies of the NIR spectroscopic properties

(RDI) using numerical simulations. The acoustic RDI is excited in a dust-gas
mixture when dust grains stream through gas, interacting with sound waves to
cause a linear instability. We study this process in a periodic box by
accelerating neutral dust with an external driving force. The instability grows
as predicted by linear theory, eventually breaking into turbulence and
saturating. As in linear theory, the non-linear behavior is characterized by
three regimes - high, intermediate, and low wavenumbers - the boundary between
which is determined by the dust-gas coupling strength and the dust-to-gas mass
ratio. The high and intermediate wavenumber regimes behave similarly to one
another, with large dust-to-gas ratio fluctuations while the gas remains
largely incompressible. The saturated state is highly anisotropic: dust is
concentrated in filaments, jets, or plumes along the direction of acceleration,
with turbulent vortex-like structures rapidly forming and dissipating in the
perpendicular directions. The low-wavenumber regime exhibits large fluctuations
in gas and dust density, but the dust and gas remain more strongly coupled in
coherent 'fronts' perpendicular to the acceleration. These behaviors are
qualitatively different from those of dust 'passively' driven by external
hydrodynamic turbulence, with no back-reaction force from dust onto gas. The
virulent nature of these instabilities has interesting implications for
dust-driven winds in a variety of astrophysical systems, including around
cool-stars, in dusty torii around active-galactic-nuclei, and in and around
giant molecular clouds.

dark matter component of this model is both strongly self-interacting and leads
to a suppression of matter density perturbations at small scales, allowing to

number of discrete level sets around the source points from which distance
information propagates. To appropriately implement our method on GPUs taking
into account memory coalescence problems, we take advantage of a graph
representation based on a breadth-first search traversal that works
harmoniously with our parallel front propagation approach. We report
experiments that show how our method scales with the size of the problem. We
compare the mean error and processing time obtained by our method with such
measures computed using other methods. Our method produces results in
competitive times with almost the same accuracy, especially for large meshes.
We also demonstrate its use for solving two classical geometry processing
problems: the regular sampling problem and the Voronoi tessellation on meshes.

states for which the leading corrections to ballistic transport are
subdiffusive rather than diffusive. These initial states are natural to realize
experimentally and include the domain wall initial condition that has been the
object of much recent scrutiny. Upon performing numerical matrix product state
simulations in the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain, we find that such states can exhibit
subdiffusive $t^{1/3}$ scaling of fronts of spin, energy and entanglement
entropy across the entire range of anisotropies. This demonstrates that
Tracy-Widom scaling is not incompatible with model interactions, as was
previously believed.

very low undersampled rate. This can practically benefit patient due to reduced
time of MRI scan, but it is also challenging since quality of reconstruction
may be compromised. Currently, deep learning based methods dominate MRI
reconstruction over traditional approaches such as Compressed Sensing, but they
rarely show satisfactory performance in the case of low undersampled k-space

equally, which results in degraded representation ability of the neural
network. To solve this problem, we propose a new model called MRI Cascaded
Channel-wise Attention Network (MICCAN), highlighted by three components: (i) a
variant of U-net with Channel-wise Attention (UCA) module, (ii) a long skip
connection and (iii) a combined loss. Our model is able to attend to salient
information by filtering irrelevant features and also concentrate on
high-frequency information by enforcing low-frequency information bypassed to
the final output. We conduct both quantitative evaluation and qualitative
analysis of our method on a cardiac dataset. The experiment shows that our
method achieves very promising results in terms of three common metrics on the
MRI reconstruction with low undersampled k-space data.

fields are applied only to qubits that interact strongly with resonant
excitation pulses. Here we use this approach to indirectly control the nuclear
spins of an NV center, using microwave pulses to drive the electron spin,
combined with free precession periods optimized for generating logical gate
operations on the nuclear spins. The scheme provides universal control and we
present two typical applications: polarizing the nuclear spin and measuring
nuclear spin free induction decay signals, both without applying
radio-frequency pulses. This scheme is versatile as it can be implemented over
a wide range of magnetic field strengths and at any temperature.

the region. We find that at the longer wavelengths, the inferred magnetic field
configuration matches the `hourglass' configuration seen in previous studies,
indicating magnetically-regulated star formation. The field morphology differs
at the shorter wavelengths. The magnetic field inferred at these wavelengths
traces the bipolar structure of the explosive Becklin-Neugebauer
(BN)/Kleinman-Low (KL) outflow emerging from OMC-1 behind the Orion Nebula.
Using statistical methods to estimate the field strength in the region, we find
that the explosion dominates the magnetic field near the center of the feature.
Farther out, the magnetic field is close to energetic equilibrium with the
ejecta and may be providing confinement to the explosion. The correlation
between polarization fraction and the local polarization angle dispersion
indicates that the depolarization as a function of unpolarized intensity is a
result of intrinsic field geometry as opposed to decreases in grain alignment
efficiency in denser regions.

of some prominent substructures for which previous estimates were not
available, and we estimate the stellar mass budget of the outer halo of M31. We
revisit the problem of quantifying the properties of a highly structured
dataset; specifically, we use the OPTICS clustering algorithm to quantify the
hierarchical structure of M31's stellar halo, and identify three new faint
structures. M31's halo, in projection, appears to be dominated by two
`mega-structures', that can be considered as the two most significant branches
of a merger tree produced by breaking M31's stellar halo into smaller and
smaller structures based on the stellar spatial clustering. We conclude that
OPTICS is a powerful algorithm that could be used in any astronomical

by us that there is a significant time lag between the infall timescales of two
components in the Two-Component Advective Flow (TCAF) paradigm, where a
standard slow moving Keplerian disc is surrounded by a fast moving halo. The
time lag is clearly due to the difference in viscosity in the flow components
and the size of the Keplerian disc may be considered to be proportional to the
arrival time lag. In this paper, using RXTE/ASM (1.5-12 keV) data, we examine
eight successive outbursts of the low-mass X-ray binary H 1743-322 since 2003
from a new angle. A dynamic photon index, {\Theta} indicates that the size of
the Keplerian disc is biggest during the brightest outburst of 2003. The size
diminishes thereafter during subsequent weaker outbursts. These results are
corroborated when two energy fluxes corresponding to the two flows are
cross-correlated with reference to {\Theta}. Moreover, {\Theta} decides
spectral transitions of any outburst. We show from the behaviour of {\Theta}
alone that the outburst of October 2008 was an anomalous outburst. In fact,
each normal outburst was either preceded or followed by an otherwise premature
outburst. This makes H 1743-322 an enigmatic source and a subject of further
study.

Counter Array (PCA) data (2.5-25 keV) as well as All Sky Monitor (ASM) data

TCAF solution. We compare this time delay from the spectral fits with the TCAF
solution of the transient low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) e.g., GX 339-4, H

Cyg X-1 the delay is negligible. We interpret the large delay to be due to the
viscous delay of a large Keplerian component to reach the inner region as
compared to nearly free-fall time taken by the low angular momentum halo
component. The delay is of the order of a few days for the low mass X-ray
binaries (LMXBs) where the feeding is primarily through the Roche-lobe.
However, it is negligible in a wind-fed system like Cyg X-1 since a very small

This nearly inviscid and dominant sub-Keplerian flow falls almost freely
towards the black hole. A standard Keplerian disc can form out of this
sub-Keplerian matter in presence of a significant viscosity and could be small
in size. However, in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), highly viscous and larger
Keplerian accretion disc is expected to form inside the sub-Keplerian disc due
to the Roche-lobe overflow. Due to two viscous timescales in these two
components, it is expected to have a larger lag between the times-of-arrival of
these components in LMXBs than that in HMXBs. Direct cross-correlation between
the photon fluxes will not reveal this lag/delay since they lack linear
dependence; however, they are coupled through the viscous processes which bring
in both matter. To quantify the aforesaid time lag, we introduce an index
({\Theta}), which is a proxy of the usual photon index ({\Gamma}). Thus, when
{\Theta}, being dynamically responsive to both fluxes, is considered as a
reference, the arrival time lag between the two fluxes in LMXBs is found to be
much larger than that in HMXBs. Our result establishes the presence of two
dynamical components in accretion and shows that the Keplerian disc size indeed
is smaller in HMXBs as compared to that in LMXBs.

learning algorithms trained using these data can produce poor out-of-sample

to pre-process the training data, producing an adjusted dataset that is
statistically independent of the nuisance variables with minimum information

decomposition. The resulting dataset can then be used in any predictive

optimality. The method is illustrated on some simulation examples and applied
to two case studies: removing machine-specific correlations from brain scan

predict recidivism. That the motivation for removing undesirable correlations
is quite different in the two applications illustrates the broad applicability

level of precision. As a consequence, the theoretical error is now starting to
lag behind the experimental one, and a ceaseless effort is required to reduce
the theory uncertainty to match the precision of the data. At hadron colliders,
QCD predictions are obtained by convoluting perturbative parton-level results
with non-perturbative PDFs, whose precise determination is crucial to reach
percent-accurate theoretical predictions. At the parton level, cross sections
are obtained through a perturbative expansion in the strong coupling. In some
cases, large terms appear at all orders and spoil the convergence of the
series. The perturbative description is rescued by resumming the series to all
orders, thereby making theory calculations accurate in regions where a
fixed-order treatment is not sufficient. In this thesis I first present two
global PDF sets where fixed-order calculations are supplemented by threshold
and high-energy resummation, respectively. In the first case, it is found that
including resummation into PDFs can compensate for the enhancement in the
partonic cross sections, with implications for high-mass resonance searches. In
the second case, resummation quantitatively improves the description of the
HERA structure functions, thus providing evidence of the onset of a new
dynamical regime of QCD in the HERA data. I then focus on Higgs production in
gluon fusion. The effect of threshold resummation on the total cross section is
found to significantly improve the convergence of the perturbative series and
to provide a robust method for estimating missing higher order uncertainty.
Finally, I present predictions for the Higgs transverse-momentum spectrum both
in the inclusive case and within fiducial cuts, exploiting a novel approach
where transverse-momentum resummation is performed in direct space.

develop the corresponding semi-parametric representation for potential outcomes

extend the definition of two popular classes of causal estimands, marginal and
average causal effects, to the case of network interference. We characterize
the bias and variance one incurs when combining classical randomization
strategies (namely, Bernoulli, Completely Randomized, and Cluster Randomized
designs) and estimators (namely, difference-in-means and Horvitz-Thompson) used

misspecification due to interference. We illustrate how difference-in-means
estimators can have arbitrarily large bias when estimating average causal
effects, depending on the form and strength of interference, which is unknown
at design stage. Horvitz-Thompson (HT) estimators are unbiased when the correct
weights are specified. Here, we derive the HT weights for unbiased estimation

importantly, we show that HT estimators are in-admissible for a large class of

spectral state, and is subject to a burst which rises to a peak luminosity of
$10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in $2.05$ s. At the peak of the burst, the temperature
of the disk has dropped by more than three orders of magnitude and its scale
height has gone down by more than one order of magnitude. The simulations show
that these effects predominantly happen due to Compton cooling of the hot
plasma, and clearly illustrate the potential cooling effects of bursts on
accretion disk coronae. In addition, we demonstrate the presence of
Poynting-Robertson drag, though it only enhances the mass accretion rate onto
the neutron star by a factor of $\sim 3$-$4$ compared to a simulation with no

large sample size $n$ but under a limited memory constraint, where the memory
can only store a small batch of data of size $m$. A natural method is the
na\""ive divide-and-conquer approach, which splits data into batches of size
$m$, computes the local QR estimator for each batch, and then aggregates the
estimators via averaging. However, this method only works when $n=o(m^2)$ and
is computationally expensive. This paper proposes a computationally efficient
method, which only requires an initial QR estimator on a small batch of data
and then successively refines the estimator via multiple rounds of
aggregations. Theoretically, as long as $n$ grows polynomially in $m$, we
establish the asymptotic normality for the obtained estimator and show that our
estimator with only a few rounds of aggregations achieves the same efficiency
as the QR estimator computed on all the data. Moreover, our result allows the
case that the dimensionality $p$ goes to infinity. The proposed method can also
be applied to address the QR problem under distributed computing environment
(e.g., in a large-scale sensor network) or for real-time streaming data.

$J_0$ underlying the geometry, which makes the manifold toric K$\ddot{a}$hler.
We find the other generalized complex structure besides the symplectic one is
always a B-transform of a generalized complex structure induced from a
$J_0$-holomorphic Poisson structure $\beta$ characterized by an anti-symmetric
constant matrix. Stimulated by the above results, we introduce a
\emph{generalized Delzant construction} which starts from a Delzant polytope

approaches have started emerging recently. In this paper, we investigate the
problem of sparsely representing discrete surfaces and propose a new
representation that is capable of providing tools for solving different
geometry processing problems. The sparse discrete surface representation is
obtained by combining innovative approaches into an integrated method. First,
to deal with irregular mesh domains, we devised a new way to subdivide discrete
meshes into a set of patches using a feature-aware seed sampling. Second, we
achieve good surface approximation with over-fitting control by combining the
power of a continuous global dictionary representation with a modified
Orthogonal Marching Pursuit. The discrete surface approximation results
produced were able to preserve the shape features while being robust to
over-fitting. Our results show that the method is quite promising for
applications like surface re-sampling and mesh compression.

disconnecting the swarm network, this paper develops a constructive strategy to
dynamically modulate the interconnections of, and the locally injected damping
at, all slave robots. By Lyapunov-based set invariance analysis, the explicit
law for updating that control gains has been rigorously proven to synchronize
the slave swarm while preserving all interaction links in the tree network. By
properly limiting the impact of the user command rather than rejecting it

on recycled millisecond pulsars. We have analyzed a 38-pulsar sub-set of the 45

pulse profile stability. The most variability, on any timescale, is seen in

long-timescale pulse profile changes is seen in PSRs B1937+21 and J1643-1224.
We have focused our analyses on these four pulsars in an attempt to elucidate
the causes of their profile variability. Effects of scintillation seem to be
responsible for the profile modifications of PSR J2145-0750. We see evidence
that imperfect polarization calibration contributes to the profile variability

changes are detrimental to the accuracy of pulsar timing and must be

(only in two dimensions) of order $\log \|x\|$. This result was found in the

the problem of getting stronger fluctuation bounds: to show that $T(0,x)$ is
with high probability not contained in an interval of size $o(\log

statements have been proved for special edge-weight distributions, and here we
obtain such bounds for general edge-weight distributions. The methods involve
inducing a fluctuation in the number of edges in a box whose weights are of

  of antibiotic use","Comments, as well as future collaborations, are extremely welcome",,,,"q-bio.PE physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The rise and spread of antibiotic resistance causes worsening medical cost
and mortality especially for life-threatening bacteria infections, thereby
posing a major threat to global health. Prescribing behavior of physicians is
one of the important factors impacting the underlying dynamics of resistance
evolution. It remains unclear when individual prescribing decisions can lead to
the overuse of antibiotics on the population level, and whether population
optimum of antibiotic use can be reached through an adaptive social learning
process that governs the evolution of prescribing norm. Here we study a
behavior-disease interaction model, specifically incorporating a feedback loop
between prescription behavior and resistance evolution. We identify the
conditions under which antibiotic resistance can evolve as a result of the
tragedy of the commons in antibiotic overuse. Furthermore, we show that fast
social learning that adjusts prescribing behavior in prompt response to
resistance evolution can steer out cyclic oscillations of antibiotic usage
quickly towards the stable population optimum of prescribing. Our work
demonstrates that provision of prompt feedback to prescribing behavior with the
collective consequences of treatment decisions and costs that are associated
with resistance helps curb the overuse of antibiotics.

parton interactions or MPIs), that $p$-$p$ centrality is relevant and that
color reconnection (CR) strongly influences fragmentation to jets. An
alternative description is provided by the two-component (soft + hard) model
(TCM) of hadron production. TCM analysis of $p$-Pb ensemble-mean-$p_t$ data
reveals centrality trends quite different from those estimated via a geometric
Glauber model based on the eikonal approximation. Glauber estimates of
binary-collision number are three times TCM estimates. Detailed study of $p$-Pb
data conflicts with a basic Glauber assumption -- that a projectile proton may
interact simultaneously with multiple target nucleons. Instead, in both $p$-$p$
and $p$-A collisions, a $p$-N collision once initiated is exclusive of other
possible interactions (during that collision), and within the collision any
pair of participant partons may interact -- a $p$-N collision is thus ""all or
nothing."" In this presentation the PMC is challenged by an assortment of
contradictory data, and evidence for $p$-N exclusivity is reviewed to make a
case for the ""preoccupied proton"" of the title.

be obtained in very small constant time, and is inherently far more useful than
results obtained by repeated execution of this tool. For example, armed with
such a specification one can ask how close an anomaly is to being deemed
normal, and can validate this answer not by exhaustively testing the algorithm

experiences a performance loss in comparison to the near-optimal Per-Group
Precoding within groups (PGP-WG), it is much simpler to implement than PGP-WG.
The method works extremely well in conjunction with Combined Frequency and
Space Division and Multiplexing (CFSDM) in correlated channels or in cases in
which the group's total number of antennas is greater than the group's
available Virtual Channel Model Beams (VCMB) number. As we show by multiple

with massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) and Joint Spatial Division
and Multiplexing for Finite Alphabets (JSDM-FA) type hybrid precoding or CFSDM
a very efficient, near-optimal design with reduced complexity at the UEs is
achieved, while each UE decodes its received data independently, without
interference from data destined for other UEs. Due to JSDM-FA Statistical
Channel State Information (SCSI) inner beamforming, the groups are easily
identified. We show that the combined ZF-PGP scheme achieves very high gains in
comparison to ZF and Regularized ZF (RZF) precoding and other modified
sub-optimal techniques investigated, while its complexity is still relatively
low due to PGP-WG. We also demonstrate the robustness of the proposed precoding

between a feature space and a semantic space (e.g. attribute space). Key to ZSL
is thus to learn a projection function that is robust against the often large

  Zero-Shot Learning","Submitted to IJCV",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to transfer knowledge from seen classes to
unseen ones so that the latter can be recognised without any training samples.
This is made possible by learning a projection function between a feature space
and a semantic space (e.g. attribute space). Considering the seen and unseen
classes as two domains, a big domain gap often exists which challenges ZSL.
Inspired by the fact that an unseen class is not exactly `unseen' if it belongs
to the same superclass as a seen class, we propose a novel inductive ZSL model
that leverages superclasses as the bridge between seen and unseen classes to
narrow the domain gap. Specifically, we first build a class hierarchy of
multiple superclass layers and a single class layer, where the superclasses are
automatically generated by data-driven clustering over the semantic
representations of all seen and unseen class names. We then exploit the
superclasses from the class hierarchy to tackle the domain gap challenge in two
aspects: deep feature learning and projection function learning. First, to
narrow the domain gap in the feature space, we integrate a recurrent neural
network (RNN) defined with the superclasses into a convolutional neural network
(CNN), in order to enforce the superclass hierarchy. Second, to further learn a
transferrable projection function for ZSL, a novel projection function learning
method is proposed by exploiting the superclasses to align the two domains.
Importantly, our transferrable feature and projection learning methods can be
easily extended to a closely related task -- few-shot learning (FSL). Extensive
experiments show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art alternatives in both ZSL and FSL tasks.

unique history of individual cities. And yet, recent empirical evidences and
theoretical models have amounted to the universal patterns, mostly
size-dependent, thereby expressing many of urban quantities as a set of simple
scaling laws. Here, we provide a mathematical framework to integrate repeated
cross-sectional data, each of which freezes in time dimension, into a frame of

cross-sectional regularity. Larger cities are not only scaled-up versions of
their smaller peers but also of their past. In addition, our model shows that
both specialization and diversification are attributed to the distribution of

ZSL is thus to learn a projection that is robust against the often large domain
gap between the seen and unseen class domains. In this work, this is achieved
by unseen class data synthesis and robust projection function learning.
Specifically, a novel semantic data synthesis strategy is proposed, by which
semantic class prototypes (e.g., attribute vectors) are used to simply perturb
seen class data for generating unseen class ones. As in any data
synthesis/hallucination approach, there are ambiguities and uncertainties on
how well the synthesised data can capture the targeted unseen class data
distribution. To cope with this, the second contribution of this work is a
novel projection learning model termed competitive bidirectional projection
learning (BPL) designed to best utilise the ambiguous synthesised data.
Specifically, we assume that each synthesised data point can belong to any
unseen class; and the most likely two class candidates are exploited to learn a
robust projection function in a competitive fashion. As a third contribution,
we show that the proposed ZSL model can be easily extended to few-shot learning

estimates of the channel parameters, which we define as the angle of arrival,

manner poses a challenge because it requires estimation of parameters from a
high-dimensional measurement -- particularly for multi-carrier systems since
each subcarrier must be estimated separately. Additionally, channel parameter
estimation must be able to handle hybrid beamforming, which uses a combination
of digital and analog beamforming to reduce the number of required analog to
digital converters. This paper introduces a channel parameter estimation
technique based on the multilinear singular value decomposition (MSVD), a
tensor analog of the singular value decomposition, for massive multiple input
multiple output (MIMO) multi-carrier systems with hybrid beamforming. The MSVD
tensor estimation approach provides a computationally efficient method and is
shown to closely match the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of parameter estimates

programming (LP) formulation, for the problems is not new. However, the
previous works have limitations, for example, that they are classified as
offline scheduling techniques since they establish a flow network model or an
LP problem considering a very long time interval. In this study, we propose how
to construct the flow network model for online scheduling periodic real-time
tasks on multiprocessors. Our key idea is to construct the flow network only
for the active instances of tasks at the current scheduling time, while
guaranteeing the existence of an optimal schedule for the future instances of
the tasks. The optimal scheduling is here defined to ensure that all real-time
tasks meet their deadlines when the total utilization demand of the given tasks
does not exceed the total processing capacity. We then propose the flow network
model-based polynomial-time scheduling algorithms. Advantageously, the flow
network model allows the task workload to be collected unfairly within a
certain time interval without losing the optimality. It thus leads us to
designing three unfair-but-optimal scheduling algorithms on both continuous and
discrete-time models. Especially, our unfair-but-optimal scheduling algorithm
on a discrete-time model is, to the best of our knowledge, the first in the
problem domain. We experimentally demonstrate that it significantly alleviates
the scheduling overheads, i.e., the reduced number of preemptions with the
comparable number of task migrations across processors.

show that the microscopic Maxwell-TDDFT scheme provides a satisfactory
description incorporating the electronic structure of thin films in the
first-principles level, multiple reflections of the electromagnetic fields at

distributions of binary-valued random variables [Borcea, Branden, Liggett JAMS
09]. Recently, these distributions have played a crucial role in the analysis
of algorithms for fundamental graph problems, e.g. Traveling Salesman Problem
[Gharan, Saberi, Singh FOCS 11]. We prove a new matrix Chernoff bound for
Strongly Rayleigh distributions.
  As an immediate application, we show that adding together the Laplacians of
$\epsilon^{-2} \log^2 n$ random spanning trees gives an $(1\pm \epsilon)$
spectral sparsifiers of graph Laplacians with high probability. Thus, we
positively answer an open question posed in [Baston, Spielman, Srivastava, Teng
JACM 13]. Our number of spanning trees for spectral sparsifier matches the
number of spanning trees required to obtain a cut sparsifier in [Fung,
Hariharan, Harvey, Panigraphi STOC 11]. The previous best result was by naively
applying a classical matrix Chernoff bound which requires $\epsilon^{-2} n \log
n$ spanning trees. For the tree averaging procedure to agree with the original
graph Laplacian in expectation, each edge of the tree should be reweighted by
the inverse of the edge leverage score in the original graph. We also show that
when using this reweighting of the edges, the Laplacian of single random tree
is bounded above in the PSD order by the original graph Laplacian times a
factor $\log n$ with high probability, i.e. $L_T \preceq O(\log n) L_G$.
  We show a lower bound that almost matches our last result, namely that in
some graphs, with high probability, the random spanning tree is $\it{not}$
bounded above in the spectral order by $\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}$ times the
original graph Laplacian. We also show a lower bound that in $\epsilon^{-2}
\log n$ spanning trees are necessary to get a $(1\pm \epsilon)$ spectral

convolutional neural network (CNN) and deep forest. Firstly, remote sensing
images are segmented into super-pixels through the combination of SLIC and
SEEDS. Structured forests is carried out to compute edge probability of each
pixel, based on which super-pixels are segmented more precisely. Segmented
super-pixels compose a super-pixel level remote sensing database. Though cloud
detection is essentially a binary classification problem, our database is
labeled into four categories: thick cloud, cirrus cloud, building and other
culture, to improve the generalization ability of our proposed models.
Secondly, super-pixel level database is used to train our cloud detection
models based on CNN and deep forest. Considering super-pixel level remote
sensing images contain less semantic information compared with general object
classification database, we propose a Hierarchical Fusion CNN (HFCNN). It takes
full advantage of low-level features like color and texture information and is
more applicable to cloud detection task. In test phase, every super-pixel in
remote sensing images is classified by our proposed models and then combined to
recover final binary mask by our proposed distance metric, which is used to
determine ambiguous super-pixels. Experimental results show that, compared with
conventional methods, HFCNN can achieve better precision and recall.

generating a Casimir thrust force on a rotating chiral particle, which will
push or pull the particle along the rotation axis. The Casimir thrust force
comes from two origins: i) the rotation-induced symmetry-breaking in the vacuum
and thermal fluctuation and ii) the chiral cross-coupling between electric and
magnetic fields and dipoles, which can convert the vacuum spin angular momentum
(SAM) to the vacuum force. Using the fluctuation dissipation theorem (FDT), we
derive the analytical expressions for the vacuum thrust force in dipolar
approximation and the dependences of the force on rotation frequency,
temperature and material optical properties are investigated. The work reveals
a new mechanism to generate a vacuum force, which opens a new way to exploit
zero-point energy of vacuum.

MG-control layer and a NMG-control layer. In the MG layer, the primary and
distrib-uted secondary control realize accurate power sharing among distributed
generators (DGs) and the frequency/voltage reference following within each MG.
In the NMG layer, the tertiary control enables regulation of the power flowing
through the point of common coupling (PCC) of each MG in a decentralized
manner. Furthermore, the distributed quaternary control restores system
frequency and critical bus voltage to their nominal values and ensures accurate
power sharing among MGs. A small-signal dynamic model is developed to evaluate
dynamic performance of NMG systems with the proposed control method.
Time-domain simulations as well as experiments on NMG test systems are
performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

points. We study the profiles of the six triadic time series. The six motif
occurrence frequencies are derived for uncorrelated time series, which are
approximately linear functions of the length of the time series. The
corresponding motif profile thus converges to a constant vector
$(0.2,0.2,0.1,0.2,0.1,0.2)$. These analytical results have been verified by
numerical simulations. For fractional Gaussian noises, numerical simulations
unveil the nonlinear dependence of motif occurrence frequencies on the Hurst
exponent. Applications of the time series motif analysis uncover that the motif
occurrence frequency distributions are able to capture the different dynamics
in the heartbeat rates of healthy subjects, congestive heart failure (CHF)
subjects, and atrial fibrillation (AF) subjects and in the price fluctuations
of bullish and bearish markets. Our method shows its potential power to
classify different types of time series and test the time irreversibility of
time series.

classification problem in the field of high energy physics (HEP). In many HEP
researches, great efforts are made to increase the signal significance with the
presence of huge background and various systematical uncertainties. Why not
develop a BDT method targeting the significance directly? Indeed, the
significance plays a central role in this new method. It is used to split a
node in building a tree and to be also the weight contributing to the BDT
score. As the systematical uncertainties can be easily included in the
significance calculation, this method is able to learn about reducing the
effect of the systematical uncertainties via training. Taking the search of the
rare radiative Higgs decay in proton-proton collisions $pp \to h + X \to
\gamma\tau^+\tau^-+X$ as example, QBDT and the popular Gradient BDT (GradBDT)
method are compared. QBDT is found to reduce the correlation between the signal
strength and systematical uncertainty sources and thus to give a better
significance. The contribution to the signal strength uncertainty from the
systematical uncertainty sources using the new method is 50-85~\% of that using
the GradBDT method.

analysing the mass distribution in a humanoid-like body, we find relations
between limb movement and their respective CoM positions. A full pose of a
humanoid robot is then described with five point-masses, with one attached to
the trunk and the remaining four assigned to each limb. The weighted sum of
these masses in combination with a contact point form an inverted pendulum. We
then generate statically stable poses by specifying a desired upright pendulum
orientation, and any desired trunk orientation. Limb and trunk placement
strategies are utilised to meet the reference CoM position. A set of these
poses is interpolated to achieve stable whole body motions. The approach is
evaluated by performing several motions with an igus Humanoid Open Platform
robot. We demonstrate the extendability of the approach by applying basic
feedback mechanisms for disturbance rejection and tracking error minimisation.

as promising templates for sensing applications, because of their intrinsically
extremely sensitive response to external perturbations. However, this applies
equally to the impact of fabrication imperfections and fluctuations in the

by inevitable (thermal) noise and show that the exceptional-point eigenstate is
not stable in its presence. To this end, we derive an effective differential
equation for the mean time evolution operator averaged over all realizations of
the noise field and via numerical analysis we find that the presence of noise
leads to exponential divergence of any initial state after some characteristic
period of time. We therefore show that it is rather demanding to design sensor

this work, we investigate for the first time the transition from asymmetric to

time-dependent generator coordinate method (TDGCM). We choose here the
transition in neutron-rich Fermium isotopes, which was the first to be observed
experimentally in the late seventies and is often used as a benchmark for
theoretical studies. We compute the primary fission fragment mass and charge

framework for graph-based deep neural networks (GNNs). NGra presents a new
SAGA-NN model for expressing deep neural networks as vertex programs with each
layer in well-defined (Scatter, ApplyEdge, Gather, ApplyVertex) graph operation
stages. This model not only allows GNNs to be expressed intuitively, but also
facilitates the mapping to an efficient dataflow representation. NGra addresses
the scalability challenge transparently through automatic graph partitioning

$k$-colorable graphs and $(1 + \varepsilon)$-stable instances on planar graphs.
For general graphs, we present a strong lower bound showing that there are no

investigated. Subsequently, the error induced by the tensor decomposition of

calculated via second-order many-body perturbation theory is benchmarked. With
the aid of the factorized Hamiltonian, the second-order perturbative correction
to ground-state energies is decomposed and the scaling properties of the
underlying tensor network are discussed. The employed tensor formats are found
to lead to an efficient data compression of two-body matrix elements of the
nuclear Hamiltonian. In particular, the sophisticated \emph{tensor
hypercontraction} (THC) scheme yields low tensor ranks with respect to both
harmonic-oscillator and Hartree-Fock single-particle bases. It is found that
the tensor rank depends on the two-body total angular momentum $J$ for which
one performs the decomposition, which is itself directly related to the
sparsity the corresponding tensor. Furthermore, including normal-ordered
two-body contributions originating from three-body interactions does not
compromise the efficient data compression. Ultimately, the use of factorized
matrix elements authorizes controlled approximations of the exact second-order
ground-state energy corrections. In particular, a small enough error is

Based on phase behaviour the drifting population was classified into four
groups : coherent phase-modulated drifting, switching phase-modulated drifting,
diffuse phase-modulated drifting and low-mixed phase-modulated drifting. We
have re-established the previous assertion that the subpulse drifting is
primarily associated with the conal components in pulsar profile. The core
components generally do not show the drifting phenomenon. However, in core
emission of certain pulsars longer periodic fluctuations are seen, which are
similar to periodic nulling, and likely arise due to a different physical
phenomenon. In general the nature of the phase variations of the drifting
features across the pulsar profile appears to be associated with specific
pulsar profile classes, but we also find several examples that show departures
from this trend. It has also been claimed in previous works that the spin-down
energy loss is anti-correlated with the drifting periodicity. We have verified

with these problems, training detectors from scratch is a feasible solution.
However, the detectors trained from scratch generally perform worse than the

paper, we explore to train object detectors from scratch robustly. By analysing
the previous work on optimization landscape, we find that one of the overlooked
points in current trained-from-scratch detector is the BatchNorm. Resorting to
the stable and predictable gradient brought by BatchNorm, detectors can be
trained from scratch stably while keeping the favourable performance
independent to the network architecture. Taking this advantage, we are able to
explore various types of networks for object detection, without suffering from
the poor convergence. By extensive experiments and analyses on downsampling

  Registration of Volume Images",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objective: Deformable image registration is a fundamental problem in medical
image analysis, with applications such as longitudinal studies, population
modeling, and atlas based image segmentation. Registration is often phrased as
an optimization problem, i.e., finding a deformation field that is optimal
according to a given objective function. Discrete, combinatorial, optimization
techniques have successfully been employed to solve the resulting optimization
problem. Specifically, optimization based on $\alpha$-expansion with minimal
graph cuts has been proposed as a powerful tool for image registration. The
high computational cost of the graph-cut based optimization approach, however,
limits the utility of this approach for registration of large volume images.
Methods: Here, we propose to accelerate graph-cut based deformable registration
by dividing the image into overlapping sub-regions and restricting the
$\alpha$-expansion moves to a single sub-region at a time. Results: We
demonstrate empirically that this approach can achieve a large reduction in
computation time -- from days to minutes -- with only a small penalty in terms
of solution quality. Conclusion: The reduction in computation time provided by
the proposed method makes graph cut based deformable registration viable for
large volume images. Significance: Graph cut based image registration has
previously been shown to produce excellent results, but the high computational
cost has hindered the adoption of the method for registration of large medical
volume images. Our proposed method lifts this restriction, requiring only a
small fraction of the computational cost to produce results of comparable
quality.

cluster's mass or other key features. To investigate this approach we use the
\textsc{MACSIS} sample of simulated hydrodynamical galaxy clusters to train a
variety of ML models, mimicking different datasets. We find that compared to
predicting the cluster mass from the $\sigma -M$ relation, the scatter in the
predicted-to-true mass ratio is reduced by a factor of 4, from $0.130\pm0.004$
dex (${\simeq} 35$ per cent) to $0.031 \pm 0.001$ dex (${\simeq} 7$ per cent)

Interestingly, omitting line-of-sight galaxy velocities from the training set
has no effect on the scatter when the galaxies are taken from within
$r_{200c}$. We also train ML models to reproduce estimated masses derived from
mock X-ray and weak lensing analyses. While the weak lensing masses can be
recovered with a similar scatter to that when training on the true mass, the
hydrostatic mass suffers from significantly higher scatter of ${\simeq} 0.13$
dex (${\simeq} 35$ per cent). Training models using dark matter only
simulations does not significantly increase the scatter in predicted cluster
mass compared to training on simulated clusters with hydrodynamics. In summary,
we find ML techniques to offer a powerful method to predict masses for large
samples of clusters, a vital requirement for cosmological analysis with future

fermions, forming an unconstrained Z2 lattice gauge theory (LGT) which
possesses dynamical proximity effect controlled by the entanglement structure
of the initial state. We expand the machinery of interaction-driven
localization to the realm of LGTs such that for any starting product state, the
matter fields exhibits emergent statistical bubble localization, which is
driven solely by the cluster interaction, having no topologically trivial
non-interacting peer, and thus is of pure dynamical many-body effect. In this
vein, our proposed setting provides possibly the minimal model dropping all the
conventional assumptions regarding the existence of many-body localization.
Through projective measurement of local constituting species, we also identify
the coexistence of the disentangled nonergodic matter and thermalized gauge
degrees of freedom which stands completely beyond the standard established
phenomenology of quantum disentangled liquids. As a by product of
self-localization of the proximate fermions, the spin subsystem hosts the
long-lived topological edge zero modes, which are dynamically decoupled from
the thermalized background Z2 charges of the bulk, and hence remains cold at
arbitrary high-energy density. This provides a convenient platform for strong
protection of the quantum bits of information which are embedded at the edges
of completely ergodic sub-system; the phenomenon that in the absence of such
proximity-induced self-localization could, at best, come about with a
pre-thermal manner in translational invariant systems. Finally, by breaking
local Z2 symmetry of the model, we argue that such admixture of particles no
longer remains disentangled and the ergodic gauge degrees of freedom act as a
""small bath"" coupled to the localized components.

derive a model atmosphere that can reproduce the observed spectra by
undertaking several physical assumptions.
  The most advanced approaches involve a depth-stratified model atmosphere
described by temperature, line-of-sight velocity, turbulent velocity, the three
components of the magnetic field vector, and gas and electron pressure. The
parameters of the radiative transfer equation are computed from a solid ground
of physical principles. To apply these techniques to spectral lines that sample
the chromosphere, NLTE effects must be included in the calculations.
  We developed a new inversion code STiC to study spectral lines that sample
the upper chromosphere. The code is based the RH synthetis code, which we
modified to make the inversions faster and more stable. For the first time,
STiC facilitates the processing of lines from multiple atoms in non-LTE, also
including partial redistribution effects. Furthermore, we include a
regularization strategy that allows for model atmospheres with a complex
stratification, without introducing artifacts in the reconstructed physical
parameters, which are usually manifested in the form of oscillatory behavior.
This approach takes steps toward a node-less inversion, in which the value of
the physical parameters at each grid point can be considered a free parameter.

the description of the model atmosphere, and the optimizations that we applied
to the code. We carry out some numerical experiments to show the performance of

leads to very specific properties. The simultaneous treatment of unpolarized
and polarized Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) allows a determination of
thermodynamical potentials (the master parameters of the model) which drive
their behavior and as a consequence those of the structure functions. The
existence of a possible relation between the gluon and a $q~\bar q$ pair leads
to define a toy model for the unpolarized and polarized gluon. In view of
forthcoming experimental results in the large $x$ region specific predictions
made by the model are presented.

Poisson-Lichnerowicz cohomology, an object encapsulating the building blocks
for the theory of deformations of Hamiltonian operators. A local scalar
difference Hamiltonian operator is a polynomial in the shift operator and its
inverse, with coefficients in the algebra of difference functions, endowing the
space of local functionals with the structure of a Lie algebra. Its
Poisson-Lichnerowicz cohomology carries the information about the center, the
symmetries and the admissible deformations of such algebra. The analogue notion
for the differential case has been widely investigated: the first and most
important result is the triviality of all but the lowest cohomology for first
order Hamiltonian differential operators, due to Getzler arXiv:math/0002164 .
We study the Poisson-Lichnerowicz cohomology for the operator $K_0 =
\mathcal{S} - \mathcal{S}^{-1}$, which is the normal form for $(-1,1)$ order
scalar difference Hamiltonian operators; we obtain the same result as Getzler
did, namely $H^p(K_0)=0$ $\forall p > 1$, and explicitly compute $H^0(K_0)$ and
$H^1(K_0)$. We then apply our main result to the classification of lower order

a number of applications in coronal seismology. Determination of the polytropic

oscillations in temperature and density corresponding to a slow
magneto-acoustic wave, the polytropic index in the solar corona has been
calculated and based on the obtained value it has been inferred that thermal
conduction is highly suppressed in a very hot loop in contrast to an earlier
report of high thermal conduction in a relatively colder loop. In this study,
using SDO/AIA data, we analysed slow magneto-acoustic waves propagating along
sunspot fan loops from 30 different active regions and computed polytropic
indices for several loops at multiple spatial positions. The obtained $\gamma$
values vary from 1.04$\pm$0.01 to 1.58$\pm$0.12 and most importantly display a
temperature dependence indicating higher $\gamma$ at hotter temperatures. This
behaviour brings both the previous studies to agreement and perhaps implies a
gradual suppression of thermal conduction with increase in temperature of the
loop. The observed phase shifts between temperature and density oscillations,
however, are substantially larger than that expected from a classical thermal
conduction and appear to be influenced by a line-of-sight integration effect on
the emission measure.

through their direct impact on star formation and stellar feedback-induced
turbulence. However, their co-evolution with these processes has still not been
thoroughly investigated, and the possible effect of the initial conditions is
largely unknown. This letter presents the first results from a series of
high-resolution numerical models, aimed at deciphering the effect of the
initial conditions and of stellar feedback on the evolution of the galactic
magnetic field in isolated, Milky-Way-like galaxies. The models start with an
ordered, either poloidal or toroidal, magnetic field of varying strength, and
are evolved with and without supernova feedback. They include a dark matter
halo, a stellar and a gaseous disk, as well as the appropriate cooling and
heating processes for the interstellar medium. Independently of the initial
conditions, the galaxies develop a turbulent velocity field and a random
magnetic field component in under 15 Myrs. Supernova feedback is extremely
efficient in building a random magnetic field component up to large galactic
heights. However, a random magnetic field emerges even in runs without
feedback, which points to an inherent instability of the ordered component.
Supernova feedback greatly affects the velocity field of the galaxy up to large
galactic heights, and helps restructure the magnetic field up to 10 kpc above
the disk, independently of the initial magnetic field morphology. On the other
hand, the initial morphology of the magnetic field can accelerate the
development of a random component at large heights. These effects have
important implications for the study of the magnetic field evolution in galaxy
simulations.

The SF is thought to be fed by metal-poor gas recently accreted. Since the gas
accretion is stochastic, there should be galaxies with all the properties of a
host but without the low metallicity starburst. These galaxies have not been
identified yet. The exception may be UGC 2162, a nearby ultra-diffuse galaxy
(UDG) which combines low surface brightness and relatively high metallicity. We
confirm the high metallicity of UGC 2162 (12 + log(O/H) = 8.52+0.27-0.24 )
using spectra taken with the 10-m GTC telescope. GC2162 has the stellar mass,
metallicity, and star-formation rate (SFR) surface density expected for a host
galaxy in between outbursts. This fact suggests a physical connection between
some UDGs and metal-poor galaxies, which may be the same type of object in a
different phase of the SF cycle. UGC 2162 is a high-metallicity outlier of the

the convergence rate of general fixed point iterations. AA has been used for
decades to speed up nonlinear solvers in many applications, however a rigorous
mathematical justification of the improved convergence rate has remained
lacking. The key ideas of the analysis presented here are relating the
difference of consecutive iterates to residuals based on performing the
inner-optimization in a Hilbert space setting, and explicitly defining the gain
in the optimization stage to be the ratio of improvement over a step of the
unaccelerated fixed point iteration. The main result we prove is that AA
improves the convergence rate of a fixed point iteration to first order by a
factor of the gain at each step. In addition to improving the convergence rate,
our results indicate that AA increases the radius of convergence. Lastly, our
estimate shows that while the linear convergence rate is improved, additional
quadratic terms arise in the estimate, which shows why AA does not typically
improve convergence in quadratically converging fixed point iterations. Results
of several numerical tests are given which illustrate the theory.

some energy levels that anticross and others that cross as function of the
impurity strength Z{\alpha}. The anticrossings are more pronounced and move to
higher charges Z{\alpha} when the length of the dipole decreases. These energy
levels turn into atomic collapse states when they enter the positive (or
negative) energy continuum. A smooth transition from the single-impurity
behavior to the dipole one is observed: The states diving towards the continuum
in the single-impurity case are gradually replaced by a series of anticrossings
that represent a continuation of the diving states in the single-impurity case.

the series of anticrossings persist in the positive and negative continuum.

via a multidimensional jump-diffusion process with a multivariate compound
Poisson process with dependent components, which allows to model claims that
occur in different lines simultaneously. Using Lagrangian convex duality
techniques, we provide a general verification-type result for
investment-underwriting strategies that maximize expected utility from the

the precautionary effect on earnings retention of risk aversion, prudence,

mean curvature flow of surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Namely, if the flow has a
spherical or cylindrical singularity at a space-time point $X=(x,t)$, then
there exists a positive $\varepsilon=\varepsilon(X)>0$ such that the flow is
mean convex in a space-time neighborhood of size $\varepsilon$ around $X$. The
major difficulty is to promote the infinitesimal information about the
singularity to a conclusion of macroscopic size. In fact, we prove a more
general classification result for all ancient low entropy flows that arise as
potential limit flows near $X$. Namely, we prove that any ancient,
unit-regular, cyclic, integral Brakke flow in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with entropy at
most $\sqrt{2\pi/e}+\delta$ is either a flat plane, a round shrinking sphere, a
round shrinking cylinder, a translating bowl soliton, or an ancient oval. As an
application, we prove the uniqueness conjecture for mean curvature flow through
spherical or cylindrical singularities. In particular, assuming Ilmanen's
multiplicity one conjecture, we conclude that for embedded two-spheres the mean
curvature flow through singularities is well-posed.

investigated for binary hypothesis testing problems in the presence of a
behavioral decision-maker. By utilizing prospect theory, a behavioral
decision-maker is modeled to cognitively distort probabilities and costs based
on some weight and value functions, respectively. It is proved that the LRT may
or may not be an optimal decision rule for prospect theory based binary
hypothesis testing and conditions are derived to specify different scenarios.
In addition, it is shown that when the LRT is an optimal decision rule, it
corresponds to a randomized decision rule in some cases; i.e., nonrandomized
LRTs may not be optimal. This is unlike Bayesian binary hypothesis testing in
which the optimal decision rule can always be expressed in the form of a
nonrandomized LRT. Finally, it is proved that the optimal decision rule for
prospect theory based binary hypothesis testing can always be represented by a
decision rule that randomizes at most two LRTs. Two examples are presented to
corroborate the theoretical results.

Disc Spirals and Low Surface Brightness galaxies on the basis of [Karukes_2017]

accelerations present in McGaugh et al. (2016) and span different Hubble Types.
We found, in our samples, that the $g$ vs $g_b$ relation has a very different
profile and also other intrinsic novel properties, among those, the dependence
on a second variable: the galactic radius, normalised to the optical radius
$R_{opt}$, at which the two accelerations are measured. We show that the new
far than trivial $g$ vs $(g_b, r/R_{opt})$ relationship is nothing else than a
direct consequence of the complex, but coordinated mass distributions of the
baryons and the dark matter (DM) in disc systems. Our analysis shows that the

major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may
yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities
may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In
our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25% of the communities are
badly connected and up to 16% are disconnected. To address this problem, we
introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields
communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that,
when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition
in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned.
Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm
runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the
Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that
the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better
partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.

vary, one obtains a family of nested graphs, each equipped with a natural
action by a symmetric group $S_n$, such that these actions are compatible.
Collections of graphs of this type are common in algebraic combinatorics and
include families such as the Johnson Graphs, Crown Graphs and Rook Graphs. In
previous work, the authors systematically studied families of this type using
the language of representation stability and FI-modules. In that work, it is
shown that such families of graphs exhibit a large variety of asymptotic
regular behaviors.
  The present work applies the theory developed in that previous work, later
refined in work of the authors and Speyer, to study random walks on the graphs
of such families. We show that the moments of hitting times exhibit rational
function behavior asymptotically. By consequence we conclude similar facts
about the entries of the discrete Green's functions, as defined by Chung and
Yau. Finally, we illustrate how the algebro-combinatorial structure of the
graphs in these families give bounds on the mixing times of random walks on
those graphs. We suggest some possible directions for future study, including
of the appearance, or not, of the cut-off phenomenon, originally presented by
Diaconis.

demonstrating very promising accuracies on public benchmarks. However, these
models are very heavy and generally suffer from low inference speed, which
limits their application scenarios in practice. Meanwhile, existing fast
segmentation models usually fail to obtain satisfactory segmentation accuracies
on public benchmarks. In this paper, we propose a teacher-student learning
framework that transfers the knowledge gained by a heavy and better performed
segmentation network (i.e. teacher) to guide the learning of fast segmentation
networks (i.e. student). Specifically, both zero-order and first-order
knowledge depicted in the fine annotated images and unlabeled auxiliary data
are transferred to regularize our student learning. The proposed method can
improve existing fast segmentation models without incurring extra computational
overhead, so it can still process images with the same fast speed. Extensive
experiments on the Pascal Context, Cityscape and VOC 2012 datasets demonstrate
that the proposed teacher-student learning framework is able to significantly
boost the performance of student network.

transport in a silica-gallium nitride nanocomposite. A surprising enhancement
of the thermal conductivity for crystalline volume fractions larger than 5% is
found, which cannot be predicted by an effective medium approach, not even
including percolation effects, the model systematically leading to an
underestimation of the effective thermal conductivity. The behavior can instead
be reproduced if an effective volume fraction twice larger than the real one is
assumed, which translates in a percolation effect surprisingly stronger than
the usual one. Such scenario can be understood in terms of a phonon tunneling
between inclusions, enhanced by the iso-orientation of all particles. Indeed,
if a misorientation is introduced, the thermal conductivity strongly decreases.
We also show that a percolating nanocomposite clearly stand in a different
position than other nanocomopsites, where thermal transport is domimnated by
the interface scattering, and where parameters such as the interface density
play a major role, differently from our case.

originating from well below the horizon. This is puzzling, because (i) no
Standard Model (SM) particle is expected to survive passage through Earth at
such energies and incident angles, and (ii) no such events were reported by
IceCube. In this paper, we address both these issues by invoking a beyond SM
interpretation of the EeV events as due to the decay of a long-lived bino in
the R-parity violating (RPV) supersymmetry. In particular, a TeV-scale
slepton/squark can be resonantly produced through the interaction of the EeV
neutrino with electrons/nucleons inside Earth, that decays to a light,
long-lived bino, which survives the propagation through Earth matter before
decaying back to neutrinos, leptons and/or quarks, thus producing upgoing air
showers in the atmosphere near ANITA. We find that the ANITA events can be
explained with a GeV-scale bino and ${\cal O}(0.1)$ RPV couplings, which are
consistent with all existing high and low-energy constraints. We also find that
an isotropic neutrino flux is inadequate for a beyond the SM explanation of
this kind, and an anisotropic flux must be invoked. Finally, we also address
the apparent tension of these observations with IceCube. Various aspects of our
interpretation are testable in the near future at different frontiers, such as
by the LHC, Belle II, ANITA-IV and IceCube.

constrain the scaling factor between the observed and maximum number of

on quantum Heisenberg manifolds $D^c_{\mu\nu}$, where the Yang-Mills functional
is defined on the set of all compatible linear connections on finitely
generated projective modules over the QHMs. A compatible linear connection
which is both a critical point and minimizer of YM is called a Yang-Mills
connection. In this paper, we investigate Yang-Mills connections with constant
curvature. We are interested in Yang-Mills connections on the following classes
of modules over the QHMs: (i) Abadie's module $\Xi$ of trace $2\mu$ and its
submodules; (ii) modules $\Xi^\prime$ of trace $2\nu$; (iii) tensor product
modules of the form $P E^c_{\mu\nu}\otimes \Xi$, where $E^c_{\mu\nu}$ is Morita
equivalent to $D^c_{\mu\nu}$ and $P$ is a projection in $E^c_{\mu\nu}$. We
present a characterization of critical points and minimizers of YM, and provide
a class of new Yang-Mills connections with constant curvature via concrete
examples. In particular, we show that every Yang-Mills connection $\nabla$ on
$\Xi$ over $D^c_{\mu\nu}$ with constant curvature should have a certain form of
the curvature such that $\Theta_\nabla(X,Y)=\Theta_\nabla(X,Z)=0$ and
$\Theta(Y,Z)=\frac{\pi i}{\mu} Id_E$. Also we show that these Yang-Mills
connections with constant curvature do not provide global minima but only local
minima, and give two other examples which show that the critical points and
minimizers of YM depend crucially on the geometric structure of the QHMs and of
the projective modules over them. Furthermore, we construct the Grassmannian
connection on the projective modules $\Xi^\prime$ with trace $2\nu$ over the
QHMs and compute its corresponding curvature, and we construct a tensor product
connections on $P E^c_{\mu\nu}\otimes \Xi$ whose coupling constant is $2\nu$
and characterize the critical points of YM for this projective module.

Influence of the disorder are studied in detail by use of large supercells with

more pronounced in Fe-Ni alloys compared to Fe-Co alloys. In particular, the
magnon spectrum at room temperature in Permalloy (Fe$_{20}$Ni$_{80}$) is found
to be rather diffuse in a large energy interval while in Fe$_{75}$Co$_{25}$ it

understood. Synchronization in neuronal networks have attracted much attention
in recent years with the main focus on transition type. Whether one obtains
explosive transition or a continuous transition is an important feature of the
neuronal network which can depend on network structure as well as synaptic
types. In this study we consider the effect of synaptic interaction (electrical
and chemical) as well as structural connectivity on synchronization transition
in network models of Izhikevich neurons which spike regularly with beta
rhythms. We find a wide range of behavior including continuous transition,
explosive transition, as well as lack of global order. The stronger electrical
synapses are more conducive to synchronization and can even lead to explosive
synchronization. The key network element which determines the order of
transition is found to be the clustering coefficient and not the small world
effect, or the existence of hubs in a network. These results are in contrast to
previous results which use phase oscillator models such as the Kuramoto model.
Furthermore, we show that the patterns of synchronization changes when one goes
to the gamma band. We attribute such a change to the change in the refractory
period of Izhikevich neurons which changes significantly with frequency.

attraction, the condensate collapses into a small bright spot. Its position and
momentum variances approach the Heisenberg quantum limit. The self-trapping
does not require either a resonant driving force or a presence of defects. The
trapped state is stabilized by the phonon-assisted stimulated scattering of
excitons into the polariton condensate. While the formation mechanism of the
observed self-trapped state is similar to the Landau-Pekar polaron model, this

derived an asymptotic fluid model for multicomponent plamas from kinetic
theory, yielding a rigorous description of the dissipative effects. The
governing equations and consistent transport properties are obtained using a
multiscale Chapman-Enskog perturbative solution to the Boltzmann equation based
on a non-dimensional analysis. The mass disparity between the electrons and
heavy particles is accounted for, as well as the influence of the
electromagnetic field. We couple this model to the Maxwell equations for the
electromagnetic field and derive the generalized Ohm's law for multicomponent
plasmas. The model inherits a well-identified mathematical structure leading to
an extended range of validity for the Sun chromosphere conditions. We compute
consistent transport properties by means of a spectral Galerkin method using
the Laguerre-Sonine polynomial approximation. Two non-vanishing polynomial
terms are used when deriving the transport systems for electrons, whereas only
one term is retained for heavy particles. In a simplified framework where the
plasma is fully ionized, we compare the transport properties for the Sun
chromosphere to conventional expressions for magnetized plasmas due to
Braginskii, showing a good agreement between both results. For more general
partially ionized conditions, representative of the Sun chromosphere, we
compute the muticomponent transport properties corresponding to the species
diffusion velocities, heavy-particle and electron heat fluxes, and viscous
stress tensor of the model, for a Helium-Hydrogen mixture in local
thermodynamic equilibrium. The model is assessed for the 3D radiative
magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a pore, in the highly turbulent upper layer

expected to play an important role in (small signal) radio frequency
electronics. Among other, graphene devices based on Klein tunneling phenomena
are already envisioned. The connection between the Klein tunneling times of
electrons and cut-off frequencies of graphene devices is not obvious. We argue
in this paper that the trajectory-based Bohmian approach gives a very natural
framework to quantify Klein tunneling times in linear band graphene devices
because of its ability to distinguish, not only between transmitted and
reflected electrons, but also between reflected electrons that spend time in
the barrier and those that do not. Without such distinction, typical
expressions found in the literature to compute dwell times can give unphysical
results when applied to predict cut-off frequencies. In particular, we study
Klein tunneling times for electrons in a two-terminal graphene device
constituted by a potential barrier between two metallic contacts. We show that
for a zero incident angle (and positive or negative kinetic energy), the
transmission coefficient is equal to one, and the dwell time is roughly equal
to the barrier distance divided by the Fermi velocity. For electrons incident
with a non-zero angle smaller than the critical angle, the transmission
coefficient decreases and dwell time can still be easily predicted in the
Bohmian framework. The main conclusion of this work is that, contrary to
tunneling devices with parabolic bands, the high graphene mobility is roughly
independent of the presence of Klein tunneling phenomena in the active device
region.

for decades. An important area of research is to study how well real networks
can be described with a small selection of metrics, furthermore how well
network models can capture the relations between graph metrics observed in real
networks. In this paper, we apply machine learning techniques to investigate
the aforementioned problems. We study 500 real-world networks along with 2,000
synthetic networks generated by four frequently used network models with
previously calibrated parameters to make the generated graphs as similar to the
real networks as possible. This paper unifies several branches of data-driven
complex network analysis, such as the study of graph metrics and their
pair-wise relationships, network similarity estimation, model calibration, and
graph classification. We find that the correlation profiles of the structural
measures significantly differ across network domains and the domain can be
efficiently determined using a small selection of graph metrics. The structural
properties of the network models with fixed parameters are robust enough to
perform parameter calibration. The goodness-of-fit of the network models highly
depends on the network domain. By solving classification problems, we find that
the models lack the capability of generating a graph with a high clustering
coefficient and relatively large diameter simultaneously. On the other hand,
models are able to capture exactly the degree-distribution-related metrics.

significant threat to human health and well-being. However, the same population

Since Low-Dose CT (LDCT) has been shown to significantly improve the lung

predict the all-cause mortality for lung cancer patients to take corresponding
actions. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based method, which takes
both chest LDCT image patches and coronary artery calcification risk scores as

proposed method is called Hybrid Risk Network (HyRiskNet) for mortality risk

demonstrates the feasibility of using deep learning techniques for all-cause
lung cancer mortality prediction from chest LDCT images. The experimental

a few kiloparsecs of the nucleus. A separate HI component is kinematically
distinct and has a very narrow line width ($\Delta{v}_{\rm FWHM} \lesssim 5$ km
s$^{-1}$), consistent with a single diffuse cloud of cold ($T_{\rm k} \sim 100$

shopping records and movie ratings) to predict personal preferences, and
thereby provides users high-quality recommendation services, which expose the
risk of leakage of user privacy. Differential privacy, as a provable privacy
protection framework, has been applied widely to recommendation systems. It is
common that different individuals have different levels of privacy requirements
on items. However, traditional differential privacy can only provide a uniform
level of privacy protection for all users.
  In this paper, we mainly propose a probabilistic matrix factorization
recommendation scheme with personalized differential privacy (PDP-PMF). It aims
to meet users' privacy requirements specified at the item-level instead of
giving the same level of privacy guarantees for all. We then develop a modified
sampling mechanism (with bounded differential privacy) for achieving PDP. We
also perform a theoretical analysis of the PDP-PMF scheme and demonstrate the
privacy of the PDP-PMF scheme. In addition, we implement the probabilistic
matrix factorization schemes both with traditional and with personalized
differential privacy (DP-PMF, PDP-PMF) and compare them through a series of
experiments. The results show that the PDP-PMF scheme performs well on
protecting the privacy of each user and its recommendation quality is much
better than the DP-PMF scheme.

design of large distributed storage systems as they allow a small number of

thus been carried out to understand the optimal rate-distance tradeoff, but
only recently the size of the alphabet has been taken into account. In this
paper, a novel definition of locality is proposed to keep track of the precise
number of nodes required for a local repair when the repair sets do not yield
MDS codes. Then, a new alphabet-dependent bound is derived, which applies both
to the new definition and the initial definition of locality. The new bound is
based on consecutive residual codes and intrinsically uses the Griesmer bound.
A special case of the bound yields both the extension of the Cadambe-Mazumdar
bound and the Singleton-type bound for codes with locality $(r, {\delta})$,
implying that the new bound is at least as good as these bounds. Furthermore,
an upper bound on the asymptotic rate-distance tradeoff of LRCs is derived, and
yields the tightest known upper bound for large relative minimum distances.
Achievability results are also provided by deriving the locality of the family
of Simplex codes together with a few examples of optimal codes.

subsurface geology and assisting activities in various domains, such as
environmental engineering and petroleum exploration. However, most of the
existing interpretation techniques are designed for interpreting a certain
seismic pattern (e.g., faults and salt domes) in a given seismic dataset at one
time; correspondingly, the rest patterns would be ignored. Interpreting all the
important seismic patterns becomes feasible with the aid of multiple
classification techniques. When implementing them into the seismic domain,
however, the major drawback is the low efficiency particularly for a large
dataset, since the classification need to be repeated at every seismic sample.
To resolve such limitation, this study first present a seismic pattern
interpretation dataset (SpiDat), which tentatively categorizes 12
commonly-observed seismic patterns based on their signal intensity and lateral
geometry, including these of important geologic implications such as faults,
salt domes, gas chimneys, and depositional sequences. Then we propose a seismic
pattern interpretation network (SpiNet) based on the state-of-the-art
deconvolutional neural network, which is capable of automatically recognizing
and annotating the 12 defined seismic patterns in real time. The impacts of the
proposed SpiNet come in two folds. First, applying the SpiNet to a seismic cube
allows interpreters to quickly identify the important seismic patterns as input
to advanced interpretation and modeling. Second, the SpiNet paves the
foundation for deriving more task-oriented seismic interpretation networks,
such as fault detection. It is concluded that the proposed SpiNet holds great
potentials for assisting the major seismic interpretation challenges and
advancing it further towards cognitive seismic data analysis.

logarithmic derivative with respect to the gauge coupling, or the logarithmic
derivative with respect to the renormalization-group (RG) invariant scale, of
an $n$-point correlator of local operators in one side to an $n+1$-point
correlator with the insertion of $Tr F^2$ at zero momentum in the other side.
Our computation involves the operator product expansion (OPE) of the scalar
glueball operator, $Tr F^2$, in massless QCD, worked out perturbatively in
arXiv:1209.1516 -- and in its RG-improved form in the present paper -- by means
of which we extract both the perturbative divergences and the nonperturbative
UV asymptotics in both sides. We also discuss the role of the contact terms in
the OPE, both finite and divergent, discovered some years ago in
arXiv:1209.1516, in relation to the low-energy theorem. Besides, working the
other way around by assuming the low-energy theorem for any 2-point correlator
of a multiplicatively renormalizable gauge-invariant operator, we compute in a
massless QCD-like theory the corresponding perturbative OPE to the order of
$g^2$ and nonperturbative asymptotics. The low-energy theorem has a number of
applications: to the renormalization in asymptotically free QCD-like theories,
both perturbatively and nonperturbatively in the large-$N$ 't Hooft and
Veneziano expansions, and to the way the open/closed string duality may or may
not be realized in the would-be solution by canonical string theories for

texture are consistent with the input image. MsCGAN is a multi-scale

the two generators are then merged into a synthetic, discriminant and
high-resolution image. On the other hand, the synthetic image is downsampled to
multiple resolutions as the input to multi-scale discriminator networks. The

  Product","Submitted to FAT* 2019",,,,"cs.CY cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent studies on disparate impact in machine learning applications have
sparked a debate around the concept of fairness along with attempts to
formalize its different criteria. Many of these approaches focus on reducing
prediction errors while maximizing sole utility of the institution. This work
seeks to reconceptualize and critically frame the existing discourse on
fairness by underlining the implicit biases embedded in common understandings
of fairness in the literature and how they contrast with its corresponding
economic and legal definitions. This paper expands the concept of utility and
fairness by bringing in concepts from established literature in welfare
economics and game theory. We then translate these concepts for the algorithmic
prediction domain by defining a formalization of Nash Welfare Product that
seeks to expand utility by collapsing that of the institution using the
prediction tool and the individual subject to the prediction into one function.
We then apply a modulating function that makes the fairness and welfare
trade-offs explicit based on designated policy goals and then apply it to a
temporal model to take into account the effects of decisions beyond the scope
of one-shot predictions. We apply this on a binary classification problem and
present results of a multi-epoch simulation based on the UCI Adult Income
dataset and a test case analysis of the ProPublica recidivism dataset that show
that expanding the concept of utility results in a fairer distribution
correcting for the embedded biases in the dataset without sacrificing the
classifier accuracy.

which determines the possible matchings between the various types of supply and

queues, which induces a holding cost. We model this problem as a Markov
Decision Process and study the discounted cost and the average cost problem. We
fully characterize the optimal matching policy for complete matching graphs and
for the N -shaped matching graph. In the former case, the optimal policy
consists of matching everything and, in the latter case, it prioritizes the
matchings in the extreme edges and is of threshold type for the diagonal edge.
In addition, for the average cost problem, we compute the optimal threshold
value. For more general graphs, we need to consider some assumptions on the
cost of the nodes. For complete graphs minus one edge, we provide conditions on
the cost of the nodes such that the optimal policy of the N-shaped matching
graph extends to this case. For acyclic graphs, we show that, when the cost of
the extreme edges is large, the optimal matching policy prioritizes the
matchings in the extreme edges. We also study the W-shaped matching graph and,

photometric binaries relative to one another and to non-photometric binary
stars. In Upper Sco and the Pleiades, these low mass binary stars have periods
that are much shorter on average and much closer to each other than would be
true if drawn at random from the M dwarf single stars. In Upper Sco, this
difference correlates strongly with the presence or absence of infrared
excesses due to primordial circumstellar disks -- the single star population
includes many stars with disks, and their rotation periods are distinctively
longer on average than their binary star cousins of the same mass. By Praesepe
age, the significance of the difference in rotation rate between the single and

relationships across diseases and clinical cohorts. The framework is first
tested on synthetic data and then applied to multi-centric, multi-database

the approach for further applications in distributed analysis of multi-centric

industries. The mechanical parts such as a motor, gear, bearings are the major
components of a process industry and any fault in them may cause a total
shutdown of the whole process, which may result in serious losses. Therefore,
it is very crucial to predict any approaching defects before its occurrence.
Several methods exist for this purpose and many research are being carried out
for better and efficient models. However, most of them are based on the
processing of raw sensor signals, which is tedious and expensive. Recently,
there has been an increase in the feature based condition monitoring, where
only the useful features are extracted from the raw signals and interpreted for
the prediction of the fault. Most of these are handcrafted features, where
these are manually obtained based on the nature of the raw data. This of course
requires the prior knowledge of the nature of data and related processes. This
limits the feature extraction process. However, recent development in the
autoencoder based feature extraction method provides an alternative to the
traditional handcrafted approaches; however, they have mostly been confined in
the area of image and audio processing. In this work, we have developed an
automated feature extraction method for on-line condition monitoring based on
the stack of the traditional autoencoder and an on-line sequential extreme
learning machine(OSELM) network. The performance of this method is comparable
to that of the traditional feature extraction approaches. The method can
achieve 100% detection accuracy for determining the bearing health states of
NASA bearing dataset. The simple design of this method is promising for the
easy hardware implementation of Internet of Things(IoT) based prognostics
solutions.

investigate the plan quality effects of decreasing the number of sliding-window

exact formulation, we interpret an algorithm previously suggested in the
literature as a heuristic method for solving this optimization problem. By
first making a generalization, we suggest a modification of this algorithm for
better handling of plans with fewer sweeps. In a numerical study involving one
prostate and one lung case, plans with varying treatment times and number of
sweeps are generated. It is observed that, as the treatment time restrictions
become tighter, fewer sweeps may lead to better plan quality. Performance of
the original and the modified version of the algorithm is evaluated in
parallel. Applying the modified version results in better objective function
values and less dose discrepancies between optimized and accurate dose, and the
advantages are pronounced with decreasing number of sweeps.

(Conservation of Hartley-Shannon Information) probability distribution. In
previous papers we have verified various predictions of this using the Uniprot
database but here we explore a novel predicted relationship between the longest
proteins and evolutionary time. We demonstrate from both theory and experiment
that the longest protein and the total number of proteins are intimately
related by Information Theory and we give a simple formula for this. We stress
that no evolutionary explanation is necessary; it is an intrinsic property of a
CoHSI system. While the CoHSI distribution favors the appearance of proteins
with fewer than 750 amino acids (characteristic of most functional proteins or
their constituent domains) its intrinsic asymptotic power-law also favors the
appearance of unusually long proteins; we predict that there are as yet
undiscovered proteins longer than 45,000 amino acids. In so doing, we draw an
analogy between the process of protein folding driven by favorable pathways (or
funnels) through the energy landscape of protein conformations, and the
preferential information pathways through which CoHSI exerts its constraints in
discrete systems.
  Finally, we show that CoHSI predicts the recent appearance in evolutionary
time of the longest proteins, specifically in eukaryotes because of their
richer unique alphabet of amino acids, and by merging with independent
phylogenetic data, we confirm a predicted consistent relationship between the
longest proteins and documented and potential undocumented mass extinctions.

$\alpha$, we will mainly focus on discussing the measurable angle of the light
ray $\psi$ at the position of the observer in Kerr--de Sitter spacetime which
includes the cosmological constant $\Lambda$. We will investigate the
contributions of the radial and transverse motions of the observer which are
connected with the radial velocity $v^r$ and transverse velocity $bv^{\phi}$
($b$ is the impact parameter) as well as the spin parameter $a$ of the central
object which induces the gravitomagnetic field or frame dragging and the
cosmological constant $\Lambda$. The general relativistic aberration equation
is employed to take into account the influence of the motion of the observer on
the measurable angle $\psi$. The measurable angle $\psi$ derived in this paper
can be applied to the observer placed within the curved and finite-distance
region in the spacetime. The equation of the light trajectory will be obtained
in such a way that the background is de Sitter spacetime instead of Minkowski
spacetime. If we assume that the lens object is the typical galaxy, the static
terms ${\cal O}(\Lambda bm, \Lambda ba)$ are basically comparable with the
second order deflection term ${\cal O}(m^2)$, and they are almost one order
smaller that of the Kerr deflection $-4ma/b^2$. The velocity-dependent terms
${\cal O}(\Lambda bm v^r, \Lambda bav^r)$ for radial motion and ${\cal
O}(\Lambda b^2mv^{\phi}, \Lambda b^2av^{\phi})$ for transverse motion are at
most two orders of magnitude smaller than the second order deflection ${\cal
O}(m^2)$. We also find that even when the radial and transverse velocities have
the same sign, their asymptotic behavior as $\phi$ approaches $0$ is differs,
and each diverges to the opposite infinity.

condition is imposed on the complement of our domain $\Omega$. It is remarkable
that the local gradient estimates has been proved firstly by G. Mingione in

such result to global ones was also proposed in the same paper. Later, the
global Lorentz-Morrey and Morrey regularities were obtained by N.C.Phuc in

particularly restrict ourselves to the singular case $\frac{3n-2}{2n-1}<p\le

good-$\lambda$ type bounds in previous work \cite{MP2018}, where the local

diabetic macular edema (ci-DME). However, center-involved diabetic macular
edema is diagnosed using optical coherence tomography (OCT), which is not
generally available at screening sites because of cost and workflow
constraints. Instead, screening programs rely on the detection of hard exudates
in color fundus photographs as a proxy for DME, often resulting in high false
positive or false negative calls. To improve the accuracy of DME screening, we
trained a deep learning model to use color fundus photographs to predict
ci-DME. Our model had an ROC-AUC of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.87-0.91), which corresponds
to a sensitivity of 85% at a specificity of 80%. In comparison, three retinal
specialists had similar sensitivities (82-85%), but only half the specificity
(45-50%, p<0.001 for each comparison with model). The positive predictive value
(PPV) of the model was 61% (95% CI: 56-66%), approximately double the 36-38% by

  Activity During Ictogenesis In Epileptic Patients","9 pages; 1 figure",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Epilepsy creates a persistent increase in the probability of spontaneous
seizures. An ictal episode evolves due to acute disturbance of the fine-tuned
balance between excitatory vs. inhibitory inputs within a neural network in
favor of excitation. The current literature that proposes the
activity-dependent disinhibition as a valid mechanism of chronic epilepsy, does
not provide clues on why this mechanism emerges only in epileptic patients and
how the vicious circle resulting of an activity-dependent disinhibition in
over-active ictogenic network would end. A new model, which presents chronic
epilepsy as a disease of faulty architecture of the neural circuit, is
discussed. Wherein; variable genetic or acquired predisposing factors drive
abnormalities in the construction of multiple neural circuits resulting in an
activity-dependent positive feedback excitatory loops which transform normal
neural circuits into ictal foci. Such new mechanism, for igniting an
activity-dependent unstable excitation with subsequent relatively stable
disinhibition, leads to an ictal escape rhythm. The propagation of such
bursting activity occurs either electrochemically via synaptic communication to
remote susceptible circuits, or chemically via a trigger wave which recruits
the non-connected proximal neurons. Termination occurs abruptly when the
inhibitory interneurons functionally recover and reimpose their inhibitory
effect on the ictogenic circuit to transform the escape rhythm into a normal,
under-control output. The proposed model elucidates various enigmatic features
of the disease; and illustrates both the end-result ictogenic mechanism arising
from the wide variety of etiologies of human spontaneous and acquired epilepsy,
and the timing of episodic transitions from normal activity to seizures.

atomic diffraction patterns is emerging as a powerful technique for probing
intricate details of atomic structure and atomic electric fields. However,
efficient processing and interpretation of large volumes of data remain
challenging, especially for two-dimensional or light materials because the
diffraction signal recorded on the pixelated arrays is weak. Here we employ
data-driven manifold leaning approaches for straightforward visualization and
exploration analysis of the 4D-STEM datasets, distilling real-space neighboring
effects on atomically resolved deflection patterns from single-layer graphene,
with single dopant atoms, as recorded on a pixelated detector. These extracted
patterns relate to both individual atom sites and sublattice structures,
effectively discriminating single dopant anomalies via multi-mode views. We
believe manifold learning analysis will accelerate physics discoveries coupled
between data-rich imaging mechanisms and materials such as ferroelectric,
topological spin and van der Waals heterostructures.

  Study",,,"10.1016/j.commatsci.2019.02.021",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graphene-water interaction has been under scrutiny ever since graphene
discovery and realization of its exceptional properties. Several computational
and experimental reports exist that have tried to look into the interactions
involved, however, none of them addresses the issue in its entirety. We have
tested the inherent hydrophobic behavior of a small graphene in water droplet
by the means of MD simulations. The analysis has been extended to multiple
graphene flakes in water and their respective size dependent responses to water
droplet. Graphene retreats from water droplet to encapsulate it from the
surface. This response was highly dependent upon graphene size with respect to
water content. Additionally, we also report self-assembly of multilayered
graphene in water by means of MD simulations, an observation which can be
utilized to synthesize such structures in a cost-effective way by
experimentalists. To fully comprehend graphene behavior in water, graphene
deformation was analyzed in the presence of water molecules. It was noticed
that graphene wrinkled to wrap around water molecules and resisted complete
failure, one that is seen in case of a sole graphene sheet. Our work will not
only address the question about whether graphene is hydrophobic or hydrophilic
but also provide insight into the behavior of graphene surface and mobility
when exposed to water which can be exploited in numerous applications.

designs with a large number of parameters to be simultaneously optimized.
Recent methodologies employing optimization algorithms commonly focus on a
single design objective, provide isolated designs, and do not describe how the
design parameters influence the device behaviour. Here we propose and
demonstrate a machine-learning-based approach to map and characterize the
multi-parameter design space of nanophotonic components. Pattern recognition is
used to reveal the relationship between an initial sparse set of optimized
designs through a significant reduction in the number of characterizing
parameters. This defines a design sub-space of lower dimensionality that can be
mapped faster by orders of magnitude than the original design space. As a
result, multiple performance criteria are clearly visualized, revealing the
interplay of the design parameters, highlighting performance and structural
limitations, and inspiring new design ideas. This global perspective on
high-dimensional design problems represents a major shift in how modern
nanophotonic design is approached and provides a powerful tool to explore
complexity in next-generation devices.

It is known as the External
Energy Paradigm. The paradigm asserts that all energies of a black hole are
external quantities; they are absent inside the horizon. These energies include
constituent mass, gravitational energy, electrostatic energy, rotational
energy, heat energy, etc. As a result, quantum particles with charges and spins
cannot exist inside the black hole. To validate the conclusion, we derive the
moment of inertia of a Schwarzschild black hole and find that it is exactly
equal to $mass \times (Schwarzschild \,\,\, radius)^{2}$, indicating that all
mass of the black hole is located at the horizon. This remarkable result can
resolve several long-standing paradoxes in black hole theory; such as why
entropy is proportional to area and not to volume, the singularity problem, the
information loss problem, and the perplexing firewall controversy.
