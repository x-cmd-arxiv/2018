closely related to the appraisal of the internal bodily state and external
stimuli. This helps us to respond quickly to the environment. Another important
perspective in human intelligence is the role of emotions in decision-making.
Moreover, the social aspect of emotions is also very important. Therefore, if
the mechanism of emotions were elucidated, we could advance toward the
essential understanding of our natural intelligence. In this study, a model of
emotions is proposed to elucidate the mechanism of emotions through the
computational model. Furthermore, from the viewpoint of partner robots, the
model of emotions may help us to build robots that can have empathy for humans.
To understand and sympathize with people's feelings, the robots need to have
their own emotions. This may allow robots to be accepted in human society. The
proposed model is implemented using deep neural networks consisting of three
modules, which interact with each other. Simulation results reveal that the
proposed model exhibits reasonable behavior as the basic mechanism of emotion.

Mech., 12(1):53-84, 2020","10.3934/jgm.2020004",,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The purpose of this paper is to compare a classical non-holonomic system---a
sphere rolling against the inner surface of a vertical cylinder under
gravity---and a class of discrete dynamical systems known as no-slip billiards
in similar configurations. A well-known notable feature of the non-holonomic
system is that the rolling sphere does not fall; its height function is bounded
and oscillates harmonically up and down. The central issue of the present work
is whether similar bounded behavior can be observed in the no-slip billiard
counterpart. Our main results are as follows: for circular cylinders in
dimension $3$, the no-slip billiard has the bounded orbits property, and very
closely approximates rolling motion, for a class of initial conditions which we
call transversal rolling impact. When this condition does not hold,
trajectories undergo vertical oscillations superimposed to an overall downward
acceleration. Considering cylinders with different cross-section shapes, we
show that no-slip billiards between two parallel hyperplanes in Euclidean space
of arbitrary dimension are always bounded even under a constant force parallel
to the plates; for general cylinders, when the orbit of the transverse system
(a concept that depends on a factorization of the motion into transversal and
longitudinal components) has period two---a very common occurrence in planar
no-slip billiards---the motion in the longitudinal direction, under no forces,
is generically not bounded. This is shown using a formula for a longitudinal
linear drift that we prove in arbitrary dimensions. While the systems for which
we can prove the existence of bounded orbits have relatively simple transverse
dynamics, we also briefly explore numerically a no-slip billiard system, namely
the stadium cylinder billiard, that can exhibit chaotic transversal dynamics.

function of surface area, volume, and size. The A/V$\times$L of a sphere is
invariably 6, which is placed in the denominator of the formula, and therefore
M indicates a relative morphological irregularity compared to the sphere. The
minimum possible value of M is clearly one, and M may range approximately to
three for coarse-grained mineral particles. Furthermore, the proposed formula,
M = A/V$\times$L/6, enables to graphically preserve the four parameters'
relations when plotting the geometry parameter distributions. This study
demonstrates the approach with two plot spaces that represent (i) L vs. M and
(ii) A/V vs. V, where A/V works as the messenger between these two spaces as
A/V = M/L$\times$6. Therefore, this approach helps comprehensively address the
four-dimensional aspects of the 3D particle geometry and better understand the

transformed into an equivalent system solved in time derivative. We show that
the scheme in this paper applies to both solved and nonsolved systems and gives
same results. One usually adds a nonphysical term to render the system
hyperbolic. However, explicit solutions and well posedness of the Cauchy
problem for some nonlinear nonhyperbolic systems of physics have been obtained
in some events by [B. Keyfitz et al.]. We also show that our scheme applies
equally well to both versions, with and without the additional term, whether
solved in time derivative or not, which provides four versions of the system.
We observe that the nonhyperbolic and the hyperbolic systems give very close
but slightly different results: the step values are always the same but peaks
in gas and liquid velocities are observed in the nonhyperbolic model, which is
typically observed in experimental results concerning the gas kick phenomenon
though we are unable to say if this result is related or not. The numerical
quality of the hyperbolic solved in time derivative system is better, therefore
our results (same pressure and temperatures, and same step values in volume
fraction and velocities besides the isolated peaks) provide a justification of
the additional term that renders it hyperbolic. Another difficulty lies in that
these systems are in nonconservative form and therefore its discontinuous
solutions cannot make sense in the theory of distributions and it has been
observed that different numerical schemes can lead to different discontinuous

flexible and easy-to-implement nonparametric tool for mean regression
estimation. The bagging technique is an elegant way to form WNN estimators with
weights automatically generated to the nearest neighbors; we name the resulting
estimator as the distributional nearest neighbors (DNN) for easy reference.
Yet, there is a lack of distributional results for such estimator, limiting its
application to statistical inference. Moreover, when the mean regression
function has higher-order smoothness, DNN does not achieve the optimal
nonparametric convergence rate, mainly because of the bias issue. In this work,
we provide an in-depth technical analysis of the DNN, based on which we suggest
a bias reduction approach for the DNN estimator by linearly combining two DNN
estimators with different subsampling scales, resulting in the novel two-scale
DNN (TDNN) estimator. The two-scale DNN estimator has an equivalent
representation of WNN with weights admitting explicit forms and some being
negative. We prove that, thanks to the use of negative weights, the two-scale
DNN estimator enjoys the optimal nonparametric rate of convergence in
estimating the regression function under the fourth-order smoothness condition.
We further go beyond estimation and establish that the DNN and two-scale DNN
are both asymptotically normal as the subsampling scales and sample size
diverge to infinity. For the practical implementation, we also provide variance
estimators and a distribution estimator using the jackknife and bootstrap
techniques for the two-scale DNN. These estimators can be exploited for
constructing valid confidence intervals for nonparametric inference of the
regression function. The theoretical results and appealing finite-sample
performance of the suggested two-scale DNN method are illustrated with several

quasiprobability decomposition through nonclassical distributions and
pure-state operators, our technique results in classical probabilities and
nonpositive semidefinite operators, defining the notion of quasistates, that
carry the information about the nonclassical characteristics of the system.
Therefore, our method presents a complementary approach to prominent
quasiprobability representations. We explore the usefulness of our technique
with several examples, including applications for quantum state reconstruction
and the representation of nonclassical light. In addition, using our framework,
we also demonstrate that inseparable quantum correlations can be described in
terms of classical joint probabilities and tensor-product quasistates for an
unambiguous identification of quantum entanglement.

free-surface generates a complex horseshoe vortex (HSV) system, which is
composed of a set of vortices exhibiting a rich variety of dynamics.
  The present experimental study examines such flow structure and characterizes
precisely, using PIV measurements, the evolution of the HSV geometrical and
dynamical properties over a wide range of dimensionless parameters (Reynolds
number $Re_h \in [750, 8300]$, boundary layer development ratio $h/\delta \in
[1.25, 4.25]$ and obstacle aspect ratio $W/h \in [0.67, 2.33]$).
  The dynamical study of the HSV is based on the categorization of the HSV
vortices motion into an enhanced specific bi-dimensional typology, separating a
coherent (due to vortex-vortex interactions) and an irregular evolution (due to
appearance of small-scale instabilities).
  This precise categorization is made possible thanks to the use of vortex
tracking methods applied on PIV measurements,
  A semi-empirical model for the HSV vortices motion is then proposed to
highlight some important mechanisms of the HSV dynamics, as (i) the influence
of the surrounding vortices on a vortex motion and (ii) the presence of a phase
shift between the motion of all vortices.
  The study of the HSV geometrical properties (vortex position and
characteristic lengths and frequencies) evolution with the flow parameters
shows that strong dependencies exist between the streamwise extension of the
HSV and the obstacle width, and between the HSV vortex number and its
elongation.
  Comparison of these data with prior studies for immersed obstacles reveals
that emerging obstacles lead to greater adverse pressure gradients and
down-flows in front of the obstacle.

This is accomplished by fitting all the planetary signals simultaneously,

be regarded as a discrete counter-part of the work by Fujishige (1980) on the
lexicographically optimal base and the principal partition of a base-polyhedron
in continuous variables. The objective of Part II is two-fold. The first is to
offer structural views from discrete convex analysis (DCA) on the results of
Part I obtained by the constructive and algorithmic approach. The second
objective is to pave the way of DCA approach to discrete decreasing
minimization on other discrete structures such as the intersection of M-convex
sets, flows, and submodular flows.
  We derive the structural results in Part I from fundamental facts on M-convex
sets and M-convex functions in DCA. A direct characterization is given to the
canonical partition, which was constructed by an iterative procedure in Part I.
This reveals the precise relationship between the canonical partition for the
discrete case and the principal partition for the continuous case. Moreover,
this result entails a proximity theorem, stating that every decreasingly
minimal element is contained in the small box containing the (unique)
fractional decreasingly minimal element (the minimum-norm point), leading
further to a continuous relaxation algorithm for finding a decreasingly minimal
element of an M-convex set. Thus the relationship between the continuous and
discrete cases is completely clarified.
  Furthermore, we present DCA min-max formulas for network flows, the
intersection of two M-convex sets, and submodular flows.

model to infer implicit networks from grouped observations. The hub model
assumes independence between groups, which sometimes is not valid in practice.
In this article, we generalize the idea of the hub model into the case of
grouped observations with temporal dependence. As in the hub model, we assume
that the group at each time point is gathered by one leader. Unlike in the hub
model, the group leaders are not sampled independently but follow a Markov
chain, and other members in adjacent groups can also be correlated.
  An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is developed for this model and a
polynomial-time algorithm is proposed for the E-step. The performance of the
new model is evaluated under different simulation settings. We apply this model
to a data set of the Kibale Chimpanzee Project.

comparatively little attention in relation to its cousin, image inpainting
(completion). Accordingly, we present a deep learning approach based on Iizuka
et al. for adversarially training a network to hallucinate past image
boundaries. We use a three-phase training schedule to stably train a DCGAN
architecture on a subset of the Places365 dataset. In line with Iizuka et al.,
we also use local discriminators to enhance the quality of our output. Once
trained, our model is able to outpaint $128 \times 128$ color images relatively
realistically, thus allowing for recursive outpainting. Our results show that
deep learning approaches to image outpainting are both feasible and promising.

due to its superior capacity in representation learning. But its applicability
is limited by the reliance on annotated examples, which are difficult to
produce at scale. Indirect supervision has emerged as a promising direction to
address this bottleneck, either by introducing labeling functions to
automatically generate noisy examples from unlabeled text, or by imposing
constraints over interdependent label decisions. A plethora of methods have
been proposed, each with respective strengths and limitations. Probabilistic
logic offers a unifying language to represent indirect supervision, but
end-to-end modeling with probabilistic logic is often infeasible due to
intractable inference and learning. In this paper, we propose deep
probabilistic logic (DPL) as a general framework for indirect supervision, by
composing probabilistic logic with deep learning. DPL models label decisions as
latent variables, represents prior knowledge on their relations using weighted
first-order logical formulas, and alternates between learning a deep neural
network for the end task and refining uncertain formula weights for indirect
supervision, using variational EM. This framework subsumes prior indirect
supervision methods as special cases, and enables novel combination via
infusion of rich domain and linguistic knowledge. Experiments on biomedical
machine reading demonstrate the promise of this approach.

dual-polarization pixels, respectively. Each pixel is made up of two crossed
microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs). These arrays are cooled to 275
mK in a cryogenic receiver. Each MKID has a different resonant frequency,
allowing hundreds of resonators to be read out on a single transmission line.
This inherent ability to be frequency-domain multiplexed simplifies the
cryogenic readout hardware, but requires careful optical testing to map out the
physical location of each resonator on the focal plane. Receiver-level optical
testing was carried out using both a cryogenic source mounted to a movable

transient. Its high brightness, rapid rise and decay and initially nearly
featureless spectrum are unprecedented and difficult to explain using models
for similar burst sources. We present evidence for faint gamma-ray emission
continuing for at least 8 days, and featureless spectra in the ultraviolet
bands -- both unusual for eruptive sources. The X-ray variability of the source
has a burst-like character. The UV-optical spectrum does not show any CNO line
but is well described by a blackbody. We demonstrate that a model invoking the
tidal disruption of a 0.1 - 0.4 Msun Helium White Dwarf (WD) by a 100,000 to
one million solar mass Black Hole (BH) located in the outskirts of galaxy
Z~137-068 could provide an explanation for most of the characteristics shown in
the multi-wavelength observations. A blackbody-like emission is emitted from an
opaque photosphere, formed by the debris of the WD disruption. Broad features
showing up in the optical/infrared spectra in the early stage are probably
velocity broadened lines produced in a transient high-velocity outward moving
cocoon. The asymmetric optical/infrared lines that appeared at a later stage
are emission from an atmospheric layer when it detached from thermal
equilibrium with the photosphere, which undergoes more rapid cooling. The
photosphere shrinks when its temperature drops, and the subsequent infall of
the atmosphere produced asymmetric line profiles. Additionally, a non-thermal
jet might be present, emitting X-rays in the 10-150 keV band.

distance between any two vertices. There are no known very efficient algorithms
for computing the Diameter exactly. Thus, much research has been devoted to how
fast this parameter can be approximated. Chechik et al. showed that the
diameter can be approximated within a multiplicative factor of $3/2$ in
$\tilde{O}(m^{3/2})$ time. Furthermore, Roditty and Vassilevska W. showed that
unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) fails, no
$O(n^{2-\epsilon})$ time algorithm can achieve an approximation factor better
than $3/2$ in sparse graphs. Thus the above algorithm is essentially optimal
for sparse graphs for approximation factors less than $3/2$. It was, however,
completely plausible that a $3/2$-approximation is possible in linear time. In
this work we conditionally rule out such a possibility by showing that unless
SETH fails no $O(m^{3/2-\epsilon})$ time algorithm can achieve an approximation
factor better than $5/3$.
  Another fundamental set of graph parameters are the Eccentricities. The
Eccentricity of a vertex $v$ is the distance between $v$ and the farthest
vertex from $v$. Chechik et al. showed that the Eccentricities of all vertices
can be approximated within a factor of $5/3$ in $\tilde{O}(m^{3/2})$ time and
Abboud et al. showed that no $O(n^{2-\epsilon})$ algorithm can achieve better
than $5/3$ approximation in sparse graphs. We show that the runtime of the
$5/3$ approximation algorithm is also optimal under SETH. We also show that no
near-linear time algorithm can achieve a better than $2$ approximation for the
Eccentricities and that this is essentially tight: we give an algorithm that
approximates Eccentricities within a $2+\delta$ factor in $\tilde{O}(m/\delta)$
time for any $0<\delta<1$. This beats all Eccentricity algorithms in Cairo et
al.

by first identifying three root causes of the low execution efficiency of

respective optimization schemes for rectifying the identified conditions.
Finally, we apply these optimization schemes to FEther, and demonstrate that
its execution efficiency has been improved significantly.

proposes a novel self-organizing deep FNN, namely DEVFNN. Fuzzy rules can be
automatically extracted from data streams or removed if they play limited role
during their lifespan. The structure of the network can be deepened on demand
by stacking additional layers using a drift detection method which not only
detects the covariate drift, variations of input space, but also accurately
identifies the real drift, dynamic changes of both feature space and target
space. DEVFNN is developed under the stacked generalization principle via the
feature augmentation concept where a recently developed algorithm, namely
gClass, drives the hidden layer. It is equipped by an automatic feature
selection method which controls activation and deactivation of input attributes
to induce varying subsets of input features. A deep network simplification
procedure is put forward using the concept of hidden layer merging to prevent
uncontrollable growth of dimensionality of input space due to the nature of
feature augmentation approach in building a deep network structure. DEVFNN
works in the sample-wise fashion and is compatible for data stream
applications. The efficacy of DEVFNN has been thoroughly evaluated using seven
datasets with non-stationary properties under the prequential test-then-train
protocol. It has been compared with four popular continual learning algorithms

determine its values. A meta-analysis using maximum-likelihood methods is
reported of the literature values of the coefficient in sixty-one datasets.
Weak dependence is found on composition and bulk strength. Clear dependence is
found on the elastic anisotropy of the different metals and on their stacking
fault energies. Surprisingly, no dependence is found on plastic strain, and the
strongest dependence is found on the average grain size of each study.
Combining these effects accounts for the reported values of about 80% of the

dependence indicate that the Hall-Petch coefficient is an artefact arising from
incorrect fitting of the data. Moreover, the grain-size dependence implies a

optical emission line fluxes are used allowing one to separate main ionization
sources: young stars in the H II regions, active galactic nuclei, and shock
waves. In the intermediate cases, when the contributions of radiation from OB
stars and from shock waves mix, identification becomes uncertain, and the issue
remains unresolved on what determines the observed state of the diffuse ionized
gas (DIG) including the one on large distances from the galactic plane. Adding
of an extra parameter - the gas line-of-sight velocity dispersion - to
classical diagnostic diagrams helps to find a solution. In the present paper,
we analyze the observed data for several nearby galaxies: for UGC 10043 with
the galactic wind, for the star forming dwarf galaxies VII Zw 403 and Mrk 35,
for the galaxy Arp 212 with a polar ring. The data on the velocity dispersion
are obtained at the 6-m SAO RAS telescope with the Fabry-Perot scanning
interferometer, the information on the relation of main emission-line fluxes -
from the published results of the integral-field spectroscopy (the CALIFA
survey and the MPFS spectrograph). A positive correlation between the radial
velocity dispersion and the contribution of shock excitation to gas ionization
are observed. In particular, in studying Arp 212, ""BPT-sigma relation"" allowed
us to confirm the assumption on a direct collision of gaseous clouds on the
inclined orbits with the main disk of the galaxy.

design, rather than just limiting to certain high frequency bands, such as
millimeter wave (mmWave) or terahertz bands or relying on the sparsity of some
specific wireless channels. In the proposed framework, analog and digital parts
of a transceiver, either linear or nonlinear, are jointly optimized. Based on
matrix-monotonic optimization, we demonstrate that the combination of the
optimal analog precoders and processors are equivalent to eigenchannel
selection for various optimal hybrid MIMO transceivers. From the optimal
structure, several effective algorithms are derived to compute the analog
transceivers under unit modulus constraints. Furthermore, in order to reduce
computation complexity, a simple random algorithm is introduced for analog
transceiver optimization. Once the analog part of a transceiver is determined,
the closed-form digital part can be obtained. Numerical results verify the
advantages of the proposed design.

experts need to understand what has occurred in the training process and why

model the rain streak interference with its motion blur mechanism. Then, our
framework starts with learning the motion blur kernel, which is determined by
two factors including angle and length, by a plain neural network, denoted as
parameter net, from a patch of the texture component. Then, after a
dimensionality stretching operation, the learned motion blur kernel is
stretched into a degradation map with the same spatial size as the rainy patch.
The stretched degradation map together with the texture patch is subsequently
input into a derain convolutional network, which is a typical ResNet
architecture and trained to output the rain streaks with the guidance of the
learned motion blur kernel. Experiments conducted on extensive synthetic and

computation formula of $N_{\mathcal F}^{\mathcal G}$ for any $(1+1)$-mode
Gaussian states is presented and an estimation of $N_{\mathcal F}^{\mathcal G}$
for any $(n+m)$-mode Gaussian states is given. For any $(1+1)$-mode Gaussian
states, $N_{\mathcal F}^{\mathcal G}$ does not increase after performing a
local Gaussian channel on the unmeasured subsystem. Comparing $N_{\mathcal

Gaussian geometric discord for two-mode symmetric squeezed thermal states
reveals that $N_{\mathcal F}^{\mathcal G}$ is much better in detecting quantum
correlations of Gaussian states.

fluid flows, which is applicable to the fluids with a full range of interfacial
tensions, especially in near-critical and critical states. An interfacial force
for N-phase systems is derived based on the previously developed perturbation
operator and is then introduced into the model using a body force scheme, which
helps reduce spurious velocities. A generalized recoloring algorithm is applied
to produce phase segregation and ensure immiscibility of three different
fluids, where a novel form of segregation parameters is proposed by considering
the existence of Neumann's triangle and the effect of equilibrium contact angle
in three-phase junction. The proposed model is first validated with three
typical examples, namely the interface capturing for two separate static
droplets, the Young-Laplace test for a compound droplet, and the spreading of a
droplet between two stratified fluids. This model is then used to study the
structure and stability of double droplets in a static matrix. Consistent with
the theoretical stability diagram, seven possible equilibrium morphologies are
successfully reproduced by adjusting two ratios of the interfacial tensions. By
simulating Janus droplets in various geometric configurations, the model is
shown to be accurate when three interfacial tensions satisfy a Neumann's
triangle. In addition, we also simulate the near-critical and critical states
of double droplets where the outcomes are very sensitive to the model accuracy.
Our results show that the present model is advantageous to three-phase flow
simulations, and allows for accurate simulation of near-critical and critical
states.

contribution to the production function; we also value each unemployed
individual by the potential marginal contribution the person would make if the
market hired the individual. We then use the aggregate individual value to
distribute the net production to the unemployment welfare and the employment
benefits. Using real-time balanced-budget rule as a constraint and policy
stability as an objective, we derive a scientific formula which describes a
fair, debt-free, and asymptotic risk-free tax rate for any given unemployment
rate and national spending level. The tax rate minimizes the asymptotic mean,
variance, semi-variance, and mean absolute deviation of the underlying
posterior unemployment rate. The allocation rule stimulates employment and
boosts productivity. Under some symmetry assumptions, we even find that an

goes with this welfare equality. The tool employed is the cooperative game
theory in which we assume many players. The players are randomly bipartitioned,

measurements. Heat capacity measurements revealed a second-order phase
transition accompanies an apparent single peak at 96 K. However, a clear ST

difference, Ts - TN, was attributed to strong magnetic coupling in the
inter-layer direction owing to CaFeAsH having the shortest lattice constant c

fractal symmetry. In a second experiment (two-alternative forced choice
procedure), they had to express their preference for one of two shapes from the
series. The shape pairs were presented successively in random order. Results
show that the smallest possible fractal deviation from ""symmetry of things in a
thing"" significantly reduces the perceived attractiveness of such shapes. The
potential of future studies where different levels of complexity of fractal
patterns are weighed against different degrees of symmetry is pointed out in
the conclusion.

incorporating the Raman sample between two phase-sensitive parametric

Seeding the interferometer with classical coherent light stimulates the Raman

squeezing-enhanced versions of CARS and SRS, where the quantum enhancement is
achieved on top of the classical stimulation.

cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image segmentation. However, most approaches
have focused on learning image intensity features for segmentation, whereas the
incorporation of anatomical shape priors has received less attention. In this
paper, we combine a multi-task deep learning approach with atlas propagation to
develop a shape-constrained bi-ventricular segmentation pipeline for short-axis
CMR volumetric images. The pipeline first employs a fully convolutional network
(FCN) that learns segmentation and landmark localisation tasks simultaneously.
The architecture of the proposed FCN uses a 2.5D representation, thus combining
the computational advantage of 2D FCNs networks and the capability of
addressing 3D spatial consistency without compromising segmentation accuracy.
Moreover, the refinement step is designed to explicitly enforce a shape
constraint and improve segmentation quality. This step is effective for
overcoming image artefacts (e.g. due to different breath-hold positions and
large slice thickness), which preclude the creation of anatomically meaningful
3D cardiac shapes. The proposed pipeline is fully automated, due to network's
ability to infer landmarks, which are then used downstream in the pipeline to
initialise atlas propagation. We validate the pipeline on 1831 healthy subjects
and 649 subjects with pulmonary hypertension. Extensive numerical experiments
on the two datasets demonstrate that our proposed method is robust and capable
of producing accurate, high-resolution and anatomically smooth bi-ventricular
3D models, despite the artefacts in input CMR volumes.

classical physics, with only modest progress made in the last few decades
beyond the so-called `log law', which describes only the intermediate region in
wall-bounded turbulence, i.e., $30-50 y^+ \text{ to } 0.1-0.2 R^+$ (in wall

based on fractional calculus to model the {\em entire} mean velocity profile

Reynolds stresses with a non-local fractional derivative of {\em variable
order} that decays with the distance from the wall. Surprisingly, we find that
this variable fractional order has a universal form for all Reynolds numbers
and for three different flow types, i.e., channel flow, Couette flow, and pipe
flow. We first use existing data bases from direct numerical simulations (DNS)
to learn the variable fractional order function, and subsequently we test it
against other DNS data and experimental measurements, including the Princeton
superpipe experiments. Taken together, our findings reveal the continuous and
decaying change of rate of turbulent diffusion from the wall as well as the
strong non-locality of turbulent interactions that intensify away from the

presenting this structure is communication in long-range impassable links or
some specific atmospheric conditions under which RF connection becomes easily
disrupted. Although these effects could be mitigated by consuming more power or
adding processing complexity, but a small user mobile phone cannot deserve more
complexity or power supply. The fact that FSO and RF links are complementary of
each other brings a new solution in mind; an access point that amplifies
received signal via short-range RF link and forwards it to via long-range FSO
link, could solve the mentioned problem. This scenario is exactly implemented
at the first part of the proposed structure. At the second part, a multi-hop
hybrid parallel FSO / RF link is implemented to connect source and destination
Base Stations. It is the first time that in a multi-hop FSO / RF system,
multi-user scheme, signal selection at each hop, known and un-known CSI in
amplify and forward relaying, and saturate atmospheric turbulence with the
effect of pointing error are considered. New expressions are derived in
closed-form for Bit Error Rate (BER) and Outage Probability of the proposed
structure and verified by MATLAB simulations. The proposed structure has
advantages of FSO, RF, relay-assisted, and multi-user systems at the same time.
Results indicate that it has low dependence on number of users and number of
relays. Therefore, it is suitable for areas with varying population and
long-range links. This structure offers independent performance without
additional power consumption, processing latency, and complexity.

leading thus to piecewise linear (PL) 4-manifold invariants. We show that some
- but not all! - of the known nontrivial cohomologies can be obtained from a
single integral bilinear form corresponding to a PL 4-manifold by using a
Frobenius homomorphism for a half of `color' variables (or different Frobenius
homomorphisms for both halves). This form can be regarded as a sophisticated
analogue of the manifold's intersection form.

this is the fact that there are very few abnormal data and the normal ones are
insufficient for the training of any kinds of machine learning model. To tackle
these problems, we proposed the solution of using a deep autoencoder network
trained solely through augmented data considered as normal. By generating
artificial abnormal trajectories, our method is tested on four different
outdoor urban users scenes and performs better compared to some classical
outlier detection methods.

which seeks to recover both the object and the probe simultaneously. Based on
alternating minimization by Douglas-Rachford splitting, AMDRS is a blind
ptychographic algorithm informed by the uniqueness theory, the Poisson noise
model and the stability analysis. Enhanced by the initialization method and the
use of a randomly phased mask, AMDRS converges globally and geometrically.
Three boundary conditions are considered in the simulations: periodic,
dark-field and bright-field boundary conditions. The dark-field boundary
condition is suited for isolated objects while the bright-field boundary
condition is for non-isolated objects. The periodic boundary condition is a
mathematically convenient reference point. Depending on the avail- ability of
the boundary prior the dark-field and the bright-field boundary conditions may
or may not be enforced in the reconstruction. Not surprisingly, enforcing the
boundary condition improves the rate of convergence, sometimes in a significant
way. Enforcing the bright-field condition in the reconstruction can also remove
the linear phase ambiguity.

$Z^d$ constructed with finite-rank perturbations in the spirit of Klopp
\cite{klopp}. These are applied to prove that the local eigenvalue statistics
$\xi^\omega_{E}$ and $\xi^\omega_{E^\prime}$, associated with two energies $E$
and $E'$ in the localization region and satisfying $|E - E'| > 4d$, are
independent. That is, if $I,J$ are two bounded intervals, the random variables
$\xi^\omega_{E}(I)$ and $\xi^\omega_{E'}(J)$, are independent and distributed
according to a compound Poisson distribution whose L\'evy measure has finite
support. We also prove that the extended Minami estimate implies that the
eigenvalues in the localization region have multiplicity at most the rank of
the perturbation. The method of proof contains new ingredients that simplify
the proof of the rank one case \cite{klopp,shirley,trinh}, extends to models
for which the eigenvalues are degenerate, and applies to models for which the
potential is not sign definite \cite{tautenhahn-veselic1} in dimensions $d \geq

such knowledge is increasingly challenging to obtain in an efficient manner. We
address this challenge by proposing a novel methodology to analyze large sets
of EHRs using a modified Count Sketch data streaming algorithm termed DreamNLP.
By using DreamNLP, we generate a dictionary of frequently occurring terms or
heavy hitters in the EHRs using low computational memory compared to
conventional counting approach other NLP programs use. We demonstrate the
extraction of the most important breast diagnosis features from the EHRs in a
set of patients that underwent breast imaging. Based on the analysis,
extraction of these terms would be useful for defining important features for
downstream tasks such as machine learning for precision medicine.

grouped into densely connected communities. Community detection is one of the
most popular and best-studied research topics in network science and has
attracted attention in many different fields, including computer science,
statistics, social sciences, among others. Numerous approaches for community
detection have been proposed in literature, from ad-hoc algorithms to
systematic model-based approaches. The large number of available methods leads
to a fundamental question: whether a certain method can provide consistent
estimates of community labels. The stochastic blockmodel (SBM) and its variants
provide a convenient framework for the study of such problems. This article is
a survey on the recent theoretical advances of community detection. The authors
review a number of community detection methods and their theoretical
properties, including graph cut methods, profile likelihoods, the
pseudo-likelihood method, the variational method, belief propagation, spectral
clustering, and semidefinite relaxations of the SBM. The authors also briefly
discuss other research topics in community detection such as robust community
detection, community detection with nodal covariates and model selection, as
well as suggest a few possible directions for future research.
