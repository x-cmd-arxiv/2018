instability of spinning black holes triggered in the presence of such fields.
The instability taps angular momentum from and limits the maximum spin of
astrophysical black holes. We compute, for the first time, the spectrum of the
most unstable modes of a massive vector (Proca) field for generic black-hole
spin and Proca mass. The observed stability of the inner disk of stellar-mass
black holes can be used to derive \emph{direct} constraints on the mass of dark
photons in the mass range $ 10^{-13}\,{\rm eV}\lesssim m_V \lesssim 3\times
10^{-12}\,{\rm eV}$. By including also higher azimuthal modes, similar
constraints apply to axion-like particles in the mass range
$6\times10^{-13}\,{\rm eV}\lesssim m_{\rm ALP} \lesssim 10^{-11}\, {\rm eV}$.
Likewise, mass and spin distributions of supermassive BHs --~as measured

well-defined Chern numbers, contains gapless edge modes in the gaps. It is
shown that the behavior of gapless edge modes is described within the framework
of the Kitaev chain where the tunneling of Majorana fermions is determined by
effective hopping of Majorana fermions between chains. The proposed approach
makes it possible to study the fermion spectrum in the case of an irrational

inherently coupled, and should be determined according to the task and
environment. In an increasing number of applications, data-driven and
learning-based approaches, such as deep reinforcement learning, have proven
effective at designing control policies. For most tasks, the only way to
evaluate a physical design with respect to such control policies is
empirical--i.e., by picking a design and training a control policy for it.
Since training these policies is time-consuming, it is computationally
infeasible to train separate policies for all possible designs as a means to
identify the best one. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing
a method that performs simultaneous joint optimization of the physical design
and control network. Our approach maintains a distribution over designs and
uses reinforcement learning to optimize a control policy to maximize expected
reward over the design distribution. We give the controller access to design
parameters to allow it to tailor its policy to each design in the distribution.
Throughout training, we shift the distribution towards higher-performing
designs, eventually converging to a design and control policy that are jointly
optimal. We evaluate our approach in the context of legged locomotion, and
demonstrate that it discovers novel designs and walking gaits, outperforming
baselines in both performance and efficiency.

optimization usually presupposes existence of a detailed dynamics model for the

methodology which optimizes hot water production. The proposed methodology is
completely generalizable, and does not require an offline step or human domain

Occupant preferences too are learnt on the fly. The proposed system is applied
to a set of 32 houses in the Netherlands where it reduces energy consumption
for hot water production by roughly 20% with no loss of occupant comfort.
Extrapolating, this translates to absolute savings of roughly 200 kWh for a
single household on an annual basis. This performance can be replicated to any
domestic hot water system and optimization objective, given that the fairly
minimal requirements on sensor data are met. With millions of hot water systems

reference mass and this closed-loop control effectively transfers the low
acceleration-noise of the reference mass to the platform. A high loop gain also
reduces non-linear couplings and dynamic range requirements in the
soft-suspension mechanics and the interferometric sensing.

algorithm combining ideas from Bayesian optimization with concepts from
Bayesian kernel density estimation. We propose an inexpensive acquisition
function balancing the explorative and exploitative behavior of the algorithm.
This acquisition function enables intuitive sampling strategies for an
efficient parallel search of global minima. The performance of PHOENICS is
assessed via an exhaustive benchmark study on a set of 15 discrete,
quasi-discrete and continuous multidimensional functions. Unlike optimization
methods based on Gaussian processes (GP) and random forests (RF), we show that
PHOENICS is less sensitive to the nature of the co-domain, and outperforms GP
and RF optimizations. We illustrate the performance of PHOENICS on the
Oregonator, a difficult case-study describing a complex chemical reaction

and quantitatively the target dynamic behavior of this nonlinear reaction
dynamics. We recommend PHOENICS for rapid optimization of scalar, possibly
non-convex, black-box unknown objective functions.

It is found that the incorporation of the water bridge diagram function is

habitability in many ways. Very metal-poor regions of the Galaxy, or those
largely devoid of atoms more massive than H and He, are thought to be unable to
form habitable planets. Moreover, if such planets do form, the young system is
subjected to close stellar passages while it resides in its stellar birth
cluster. Various potential hazards remain after clusters disperse. For
instance, central galactic regions may present risks to habitability via nearby
supernovae, gamma ray bursts (GRBs), and frequent comet showers. In addition,
planets residing within very wide binary star systems are affected by the
Galaxy, as local gravitational perturbations from the Galaxy can increase the
binary's eccentricity until it destabilizes the planets it hosts. Here we
review the most recent work on the main galactic influences over planetary
habitability. Although there must be some metallicity limit below which rocky
planets cannot form, recent exoplanet surveys show that they form around stars
with a very large range of metallicities. Once formed, the probability of star
clusters destabilizing planetary systems only becomes high for rare, extremely
long-lived clusters. Regarding threats to habitability from supernovae, GRBs,
and comet showers, many recent studies suggest that their hazards are more
limited than originally thought. Finally, denser regions of the Galaxy enhance
the threat that very wide binary companions pose to planetary habitability, but
the probability that a very wide binary star disrupts habitability will always
be substantially below 100% for any environment. While some Milky Way regions
must be more hospitable to habitable planets than others, it is difficult to
state that habitable planets are confined to any well-defined region of the
Galaxy or that any other particular region of the Galaxy is uninhabitable.

weighting using the theory uncertainties deduced from the factorization

provides an evaluation of the theoretical uncertainty of the matched cross

star spot studies, and it is particularly significant for a future polarimetric

models for a center-to-limb variation of the intensity and polarization in

late-type stars of different gravity, effective temperature, and spottedness.
We developed a code that simulates various spot configurations or uses

reliance (MCR) as the range of VI values across all well-performing model in a
prespecified class. Thus, MCR gives a more comprehensive description of
importance by accounting for the fact that many prediction models, possibly of
different parametric forms, may fit the data well. In the process of deriving
MCR, we show several informative results for permutation-based VI estimates,
based on the VI measures used in Random Forests. Specifically, we derive
connections between permutation importance estimates for a single prediction
model, U-statistics, conditional variable importance, conditional causal
effects, and linear model coefficients. We then give probabilistic bounds for
MCR, using a novel, generalizable technique. We apply MCR to a public data set
of Broward County criminal records to study the reliance of recidivism
prediction models on sex and race. In this application, MCR can be used to help
inform VI for unknown, proprietary models.

inference generically involves simulating mock data and comparing to the
observed data; this comparison in data-space suffers from the curse of
dimensionality and requires compression of the data to a small number of
summary statistics to be tractable. In this paper we use massive
asymptotically-optimal data compression to reduce the dimensionality of the
data-space to just one number per parameter, providing a natural and optimal
framework for summary statistic choice for likelihood-free inference. Secondly,
we present the first cosmological application of Density Estimation
Likelihood-Free Inference (\textsc{delfi}), which learns a parameterized model
for joint distribution of data and parameters, yielding both the parameter
posterior and the model evidence. This approach is conceptually simple,
requires less tuning than traditional Approximate Bayesian Computation
approaches to likelihood-free inference and can give high-fidelity posteriors
from orders of magnitude fewer forward simulations. As an additional bonus, it
enables parameter inference and Bayesian model comparison simultaneously. We
demonstrate Density Estimation Likelihood-Free Inference with massive data
compression on an analysis of the joint light-curve analysis supernova data, as
a simple validation case study. We show that high-fidelity posterior inference
is possible for full-scale cosmological data analyses with as few as $\sim

the ISF tracing its high-density material and velocity structure down to scales
of 0.009 pc. From the analysis of the gas kinematics, we identify a total of 55
dense fibers in the central region of the ISF. Independently of their location,
these fibers are characterized by transonic internal motions, lengths of ~0.15
pc, and masses per-unit-length close to those expected in hydrostatic
equilibrium. The ISF fibers are spatially organized forming a dense bundle with
multiple hub-like associations likely shaped by the local gravitational
potential. Within this complex network, the ISF fibers show a compact radial
emission profile with a median FWHM of 0.035 pc systematically narrower than
the previously proposed universal 0.1 pc filament width. Our ALMA observations
reveal complex bundles of fibers in the ISF, suggesting strong similarities
between the internal substructure of this massive filament and previously
studied lower-mass objects. The fibers show identical dynamic properties in
both low- and high-mass regions, and their widespread detection suggests a
preferred organizational mechanism of gas in which the physical fiber
dimensions (width and length) are self-regulated depending on their intrinsic
gas density. Combined with previous works, we identify a systematic increase of
the surface density of fibers as a function of the total mass per-unit-length
in filamentary clouds. Based on this empirical correlation, we propose a
unified star-formation scenario where the observed differences between low- and
high-mass clouds emerge naturally from the initial concentration of fibers.

$(\mu_\alpha \cos\delta , \mu_\delta) = (-3.238 \pm 0.028, -6.716 \pm 0.043)$

of the multiple stellar populations of the globular cluster $\omega$ Centauri
in one of the parallel Hubble Space Telescope (HST) fields, located at about
3.5 half-light radii from the center of the cluster. Thanks to the over
15-year-long baseline and the exquisite astrometric precision of the HST
cameras, well-measured stars in our proper-motion catalog have errors as low as
$\sim 10\ \mu$as yr$^{-1}$, and the catalog itself extends to near the
hydrogen-burning limit of the cluster. We show that second-generation (2G)
stars are significantly more radially anisotropic than first-generation (1G)
stars. The latter are instead consistent with an isotropic velocity
distribution. In addition, 1G have excess systemic rotation in the plane of the
sky with respect to 2G stars. We show that the six populations below the
main-sequence (MS) knee identified in our first paper are associated to the
five main population groups recently isolated on the upper MS in the core of
cluster. Furthermore, we find both 1G and 2G stars in the field to be far from
being in energy equipartition, with $\eta_{\rm 1G}=-0.007\pm0.026$ for the
former, and $\eta_{\rm 2G}=0.074\pm0.029$ for the latter, where $\eta$ is
defined so that the velocity dispersion $\sigma_\mu$ scales with stellar mass
as $\sigma_\mu \propto m^{-\eta}$. The kinematical differences reported here
can help constrain the formation mechanisms for the multiple stellar
populations in $\omega$ Centauri and other globular clusters. We make our
astro-photometric catalog publicly available.

measure cosmological parameters, especially the Hubble constant ($H_0$). Recent
studies show that by combining just three multiply-imaged AGN systems, one can
determine $H_0$ to 2.4% precision. Furthermore, the number of time-delay lens
systems is growing rapidly, enabling the determination of $H_0$ to 1% precision
in the near future. However, as the precision increases it is important to
ensure that systematic errors and biases remain subdominant. For this purpose,
challenges with simulated datasets are a key component in this process.
Following the experience of the past challenge on time delay, where it was
shown that time delays can indeed be measured precisely and accurately at the
sub-percent level, we now present the ""Time Delay Lens Modeling Challenge""
(TDLMC). The goal of this challenge is to assess the present capabilities of
lens modeling codes and assumptions and test the level of accuracy of inferred
cosmological parameters given realistic mock datasets. We invite scientists to
model a set of simulated HST observations of 50 mock lens systems. The systems
are organized in rungs, with the complexity and realism increasing going up the
ladder. The goal of the challenge is to infer $H_0$ for each rung, given the
HST images, the time delay, and stellar velocity dispersion of the deflector
for a fixed background cosmology. The TDLMC challenge starts with the mock data
release on 2018 January 8th. The deadline for blind submission is different for
each rung. The deadline for Rung 0-1 is 2018 September 8; the deadline for Rung
2 is 2019 April 8 and the one for Rung 3 is 2019 September 8. This first paper
gives an overview of the challenge including the data design, and a set of
metrics to quantify the modeling performance and challenge details.

insight into the strength and geometry of stellar magnetic fields and the

the first model capable of predicting radio emission through the electron
cyclotron maser instability using observed stellar magnetic maps of low-mass

using spectropolarimetric observations of the surface magnetic fields and the
X-ray emission measure. We then model the emission of photons from the
locations within the corona that satisfy the conditions for electron cyclotron
maser emission. Our model predicts the frequency, and intensity of radio
photons from within the stellar corona.
  We have benchmarked our model against the low-mass star V374 Peg. This star
has both radio observations from the Very Large Array and a nearly simultaneous
magnetic map. Using our model we are able to fit the radio observations of V374
Peg, providing additional evidence that the radio emission observed from
low-mass stars may originate from the electron cyclotron maser instability. Our
model can now be extended to all stars with observed magnetic maps to predict
the expected frequency and variability of stellar radio emission in an effort
to understand and guide future radio observations of low-mass stars.

separated by ~14-45 kpc from the quasar hosts, and we interpret them as major

major mergers may be important drivers for rapid, early SMBH growth. However,
the fact that not all high-SFR quasar hosts are accompanied by interacting
SMGs, and their ordered gas kinematics observed by ALMA, suggest that other
processes may be fueling these systems. Our analysis thus demonstrates the
diversity of host galaxy properties and gas accretion mechanisms associated
with early and rapid SMBH growth.

resolve the corona heating problem, may also trigger the larger solar flares.
The arguments are based on the model where emission of extreme ultra violet
(EUV) radiation and soft x-rays from the Sun are powered externally by incident
dark matter particles within the Axion Quark Nugget (AQN) Dark Matter Model.
The corresponding annihilation events of the AQNs with the solar material are
identified with nanoflares. This model was originally invented as a natural
explanation of the observed ratio $\Omega_{\rm dark} \sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$
when the DM and visible matter densities assume the same order of magnitude
values. This model gives a very reasonable intensity of EUV radiation without
adjustments of any parameters in the model. When the same nuggets enter the
regions with high magnetic field they serve as the triggers igniting the
magnetic reconnections which eventually may lead to much larger flares.
Technically, the magnetic reconnection is ignited due to the shock wave which
inevitably develops when the dark matter nuggets enter the solar atmosphere
with velocity $v_{\rm AQN}\sim ~600~ {\rm km/s}$ which is much higher than the
speed of sound $c_s$, such that the Mach number $M=v_{\rm AQN}/c_s\gg 1$. These
shock waves generate very strong and very short impulses expressed in terms of
pressure $\Delta p/p\sim M^2$ and temperature $\Delta T/T\sim M^2$ in vicinity
of (would be) magnetic reconnection area. The mechanism is consistent with the
observed scaling of the flare distribution $dN\sim W^{-\alpha}dW$ as a function
of the flare's energy $W$. We also speculate that the same nuggets may trigger
the sunquakes which are known to be correlated with large flares.

heliospheric shocks. Energetic particles can be effectively reflected and
accelerated regardless of shock inclination via a process that we call
\emph{diffusive shock re-acceleration}. We find that reaccelerated seeds can
drive the streaming instability in the shock upstream and produce effective
magnetic field amplification. This can eventually trigger the injection of
thermal protons even at oblique shocks that ordinarily cannot inject thermal
particles. We characterize the current in reflected seeds, finding that it
tends to a universal value $J\simeq e n_{cr} v_{sh}$, where $e n_{cr}$ is the
seed charge density and $v_{sh}$ is the shock velocity. When applying our
results to SNRs, we find that the re-acceleration of Galactic CRs can excite
the Bell instability to non-linear levels in less than $\sim 10$ yr, thereby
providing a minimum level of magnetic field amplification for any SNR shock.
Finally, we discuss the relevance of diffusive shock re-acceleration also for
other environments, such as heliospheric shocks, Galactic superbubbles, and
clusters of galaxies.

turbulence and outflows in rapidly star-forming galaxies. Recent studies focus
on the highly optically-thick limit relevant to the densest ultra-luminous
galaxies and super star clusters, where reprocessed infrared photons provide
the dominant source of electromagnetic momentum. However, even among starburst
galaxies, the great majority instead lie in the so-called ""single-scattering""
limit, where the system is optically-thick to the incident starlight, but
optically-thin to the re-radiated infrared. In this paper we present a
stability analysis and multidimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations
exploring the stability and dynamics of isothermal dusty gas columns in this
regime. We describe our algorithm for full angle-dependent radiation transport
based on the discontinuous Galerkin finite element method. For a range of
near-Eddington fluxes, we show that the medium is unstable, producing
convective-like motions in a turbulent atmosphere with a scale height
significantly inflated compared to the gas pressure scale height and
mass-weighted turbulent energy densities of $\sim 0.01-0.1$ of the midplane
radiation energy density, corresponding to mass-weighted velocity dispersions
of Mach number $\sim 0.5-2$. Extrapolation of our results to optical depths of
$10^3$ implies maximum turbulent Mach numbers of $\sim20$. Comparing our
results to galaxy-averaged observations, and subject to the approximations of
our calculations, we find that radiation pressure does not contribute
significantly to the effective supersonic pressure support in star-forming
disks, which in general are substantially sub-Eddington. We further examine the
time-averaged vertical density profiles in dynamical equilibrium and comment on
implications for radiation-pressure-driven galactic winds.

small range of Galactocentric radius ($7.9 \leq R_\mathrm{GC} \leq 9.5$ kpc),
but extend up to 4 kpc in height from the Galactic plane, and several kpc in
the direction of Galactic anti-rotation (at longitude $260 ^\circ \leq \ell
\leq 280^\circ$). This allows us to reliably measure the vertical density and
abundance profiles of the chemically and kinematically defined `thick' and
`thin' disks of the Galaxy. The thin disk (low-$\alpha$ population) exhibits a
steep negative vertical metallicity gradient, at d[M/H]/d$z=-0.18 \pm 0.01$ dex
kpc$^{-1}$, which is broadly consistent with previous studies. In contrast, its
vertical $\alpha$-abundance profile is almost flat, with a gradient of
d[$\alpha$/M]/d$z$ = $0.008 \pm 0.002$ dex kpc$^{-1}$. The steep vertical
metallicity gradient of the low-$\alpha$ population is in agreement with models
where radial migration has a major role in the evolution of the thin disk. The
thick disk (high-$\alpha$ population) has a weaker vertical metallicity
gradient d[M/H]/d$z = -0.058 \pm 0.003$ dex kpc$^{-1}$. The $\alpha$-abundance
of the thick disk is nearly constant with height, d[$\alpha$/M]/d$z$ = $0.007
\pm 0.002$ dex kpc$^{-1}$. The negative gradient in metallicity and the small
gradient in [$\alpha$/M] indicate that the high-$\alpha$ population experienced
a settling phase, but also formed prior to the onset of major SNIa enrichment.
We explore the implications of the distinct $\alpha$-enrichments and narrow
[$\alpha$/M] range of the sub-populations in the context of thick disk
formation.

state(s) wave function, we introduce a new quantum information tool, coined the
information convex, to capture the bulk and boundary topological excitations of
a 2D topological order. Defined as a set of reduced density matrices that
minimizes the energy in a subsystem, the information convex encodes not only
the bulk anyons but also the gapped boundaries of 2D topological orders. Using
untwisted gapped boundaries of non-Abelian quantum doubles as an example, we
show how the information convex reveals and characterizes deconfined bulk and

Interference experiments in cold atoms provide potential measurements for the

growth conditions in all spinel ferrite thin films. The presence of APBs in
epitaxial films of the inverse spinel Fe3O4 alters their electronic and
magnetic properties due to strong antiferromagnetic (AF) interactions across
these boundaries. The effect of using in-situ electric field assisted growth on
the migration of APBs in hetero epitaxial Fe3O4(100)/MgO(100) thin films have
been explored in the present work. The electric field assisted growth is found
to reduce the AF interactions across APBs and as a consequence APBs free thin
film like properties are obtained, which have been probed by electronic,
magnetic and structural characterization. An increase in energy associated with
the nucleation and/or early stage of the growth and, therefore, a corresponding
increase in surface mobility of the ad-atoms play a critical role in
controlling the density of APBs. This innovative technique can be employed to
grow epitaxial spinel thin films with controlled AF interactions across APBs.

support. By using posterior sampling algorithms, one can quantify uncertainty
without relying on asymptotic approximations. However, sharply constrained
priors are (a) not necessary in some settings; and (b) tend to limit modeling
scope to a narrow set of distributions that are tractable computationally.
Inspired by the vast literature that replaces the slab-and-spike prior with a
continuous approximation, we propose to replace the sharp indicator function of
the constraint with an exponential kernel, thereby creating a
close-to-constrained neighborhood within the Euclidean space in which the
constrained subspace is embedded. This kernel decays with distance from the
constrained space at a rate depending on a relaxation hyperparameter. By
avoiding the sharp constraint, we enable use of off-the-shelf posterior
sampling algorithms, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, facilitating automatic
computation in broad models. We study the constrained and relaxed distributions

illustrate the method through multiple novel modeling examples.

10^(-7) of the original space. Additional sets of biologically relevant
experimental data, each of size 5, reduce the size of this space by a further
three and two orders of magnitude respectively. Hence, we provide insight into

have revealed the presence of a high thermal pressure (P ~ 10^7-10^8 K cm-3)
thin compressed layer at the PDR surface where warm molecular tracer emission
(e.g. CH+, SH+, high-J CO, H2,...) originate. These high pressures (unbalanced
by the surrounding environment) and a correlation between pressure and incident
FUV field (G0) seem to indicate a dynamical origin with the radiation field
playing an important role in driving the dynamics. We investigate whether
photoevaporation of the illuminated edge of a molecular cloud could explain
these high pressures and pressure-UV field correlation. We developed a 1D
hydrodynamical PDR code coupling hydrodynamics, EUV and FUV radiative transfer
and time-dependent thermo-chemical evolution. We applied it to a 1D
plane-parallel photoevaporation scenario where a UV-illuminated molecular cloud
can freely evaporate in a surrounding low-pressure medium. We find that
photoevaporation can produce high thermal pressures and the observed P-G0
correlation, almost independently from the initial gas density. In addition, we
find that constant-pressure PDR models are a better approximation to the
structure of photoevaporating PDRs than constant-density PDR models, although
moderate pressure gradients are present. Strong density gradients from the
molecular to the neutral atomic region are found, which naturally explain the
large density contrasts (1-2 orders of magnitude) derived from observations of
different tracers. The photoevaporating PDR is preceded by a low velocity shock
(a few km/s) propagating into the molecular cloud. Photoevaporating PDR models
offer a promising explanation to the recent observational evidence of dynamical
effects in PDRs.

says that given any $(X,d_X)$ there exists a \emph{tree metric} $t_X$ on $X$
such that $\|d_X-t_X\|_\infty$ is bounded above by twice $\mathrm{hyp}(X)\cdot
\log(2\,|X|)$. Here $\mathrm{hyp}(X)$ is the \emph{hyperbolicity} of $X$, a
quantity that measures the \emph{treeness} of $4$-tuples of points in $X$. This
bound is known to be asymptotically tight.
  We improve this bound by restricting ourselves to metric spaces arising from
filtered posets. By doing so we are able to replace the cardinality appearing
in Gromov's bound by a certain poset theoretic invariant (the maximum length of
fences in the poset) which can be much smaller thus significantly improving the
approximation bound.
  The setting of metric spaces arising from posets is rich: For example, save
for the possible addition of new vertices, every finite metric graph can be
induced from a filtered poset. Since every finite metric space can be
isometrically embedded into a finite metric graph, our ideas are applicable to
finite metric spaces as well.
  At the core of our results lies the adaptation of the Reeb graph and Reeb
tree constructions and the concept of hyperbolicity to the setting of posets,

natural use of eye tracking in comparison to a use in which the eye tracker
directly substitutes control input devices, such as gamepads. The study was
conducted on a custom endless runner FPS, Zombie Runner, using an affordable
eye tracker. Evaluation sessions showed that the proposed use of eye tracking
provides a more challenging and immersive experience to the player, when
compared to its absence. However, a strong correlation between eye tracker
calibration problems and player's overall experience was found. This means that
eye tracking technology still needs to evolve but also means that once
technology gets mature enough players are expected to benefit greatly from the
inclusion of eye tracking in their gaming experience.

serious challenge in its theoretical and numerical studies. A common strategy
in theoretical studies is to utilize the pressure formulation of the equation
where a new variable called the mathematical pressure is introduced. It is
known that the new variable has much better regularity than the original one
and Darcy's law for the movement of the free boundary can be expressed
naturally in this new variable. The pressure formulation has not been used in
numerical studies. The goal of this work is to study its use in the adaptive
finite element solution of the porous medium equation. The MMPDE moving mesh
strategy is employed for adaptive mesh movement while linear finite elements
are used for spatial discretization. The free boundary is traced explicitly by
integrating Darcy's law with the Euler scheme. Numerical results are presented
for three two-dimensional examples. The method is shown to be second-order in
space and first-order in time in the pressure variable. Moreover, the
convergence order of the error in the location of the free boundary is almost
second-order in the maximum norm. However, numerical results also show that the
convergence order of the method in the original variable stays between
first-order and second-order in the $L^1$ norm or between 0.5th-order and
first-order in the $L^2$ norm. Nevertheless, the current method can offer some
advantages over numerical methods based on the original formulation for
situations with large exponents or when a more accurate location of the free
boundary is desired.

near black holes. However, a specific mechanism is still a matter of debate; it
is very likely that different processes dominate under various conditions. In
particular, for the acceleration of particles and their collimation in jets, an
ordered component of the magnetic field seems to be essential. Here we discuss
the role of large-scale magnetic fields in transporting the charged particles
and dust grains from the bound orbits in the equatorial plane of a rotating
(Kerr) black hole and the resulting acceleration along trajectories escaping
the system in a direction parallel to the symmetry axis (perpendicular to the
accretion disk). We consider a specific scenario of destabilization of circular
geodesics of initially neutral matter by charging (e.g., due to
photoionization). Some particles may be set on escaping trajectories and attain
relativistic velocity. The case of charged particles differs from charged dust
grains by their charge-to-mass ratio, but the acceleration mechanism operates
in a similar manner. It appears that the chaotic dynamics controls the outflow
and supports the formation of near-horizon escape zones. We employ the
technique of recurrence plots to characterize the onset of chaos in the
outflowing medium. We investigate the system numerically and construct the
basin-boundary plots, which show the location and the extent of the escape
zones. The effects of black hole spin and magnetic field strength on the
formation and location of escape zones are discussed, and the maximal escape

validated using F1000 and HCP data. We detected novel sex differences in
resting-state connectivity that were not previously reported. This current
study more thoroughly examined sex differences as a function of age and their
clinical correlates, with findings supporting a basal configuration framework.
To this end, we found that men and women do not significantly differ in the
22-25 age range. However, these same non-significant differences attained
statistical significance in the 26-30 age group, while becoming highly
statistically significant in the 31-35 age group. At the most global level,
areas of diverging sex difference include parts of the prefrontal cortex and
the temporal lobe, amygdala, hippocampus, inferior parietal lobule, posterior

interact with age and the basal configuration between sexes. In sum, our study

shifting away from simple concepts, and towards thinking globally and
probabilistically how the brain exhibits dynamic sex-specific connectivity

process by the Pop III stars, we carry out a series of numerical simulations
including the feedback effects of photoionization and supernovae (SNe) of Pop
III stars with a range of masses of minihaloes (MHs), M_halo , and Pop III
stars, M_PopIII . We find that the metal-rich ejecta reaches neighbouring
haloes and external enrichment (EE) occurs when the halo binding energy is
sufficiently below the SN explosion energy, E_SN . The neighbouring haloes are
only superficially enriched, and the metallicity of the clouds is [Fe/H] < -5.
Otherwise, the SN ejecta falls back and recollapses to form enriched cloud,
i.e. internal enrichment (IE) process takes place. In case that a Pop III star
explodes as a core-collapse SNe (CCSNe), MHs undergo IE, and the metallicity in
the recollapsing region is -5 < [Fe/H] < -3 in most cases. We conclude that IE
from a single CCSN can explain the formation of EMP stars. For pair-instability
SNe (PISNe), EE takes place for all relevant mass range of MHs, consistent with
no observational sign of PISNe among EMP stars.

unsupervised, depend on the quality of the input characteristics to generate a
good model. The amount of these variables is also important, since performance
tends to decline as the input dimensionality increases, hence the interest in
using feature fusion techniques, able to produce feature sets that are more
compact and higher level. A plethora of procedures to fuse original variables
for producing new ones has been developed in the past decades. The most basic
ones use linear combinations of the original variables, such as PCA (Principal
Component Analysis) and LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis), while others find
manifold embeddings of lower dimensionality based on non-linear combinations,
such as Isomap or LLE (Linear Locally Embedding) techniques.
  More recently, autoencoders (AEs) have emerged as an alternative to manifold
learning for conducting nonlinear feature fusion. Dozens of AE models have been
proposed lately, each with its own specific traits. Although many of them can
be used to generate reduced feature sets through the fusion of the original
ones, there also AEs designed with other applications in mind.
  The goal of this paper is to provide the reader with a broad view of what an
AE is, how they are used for feature fusion, a taxonomy gathering a broad range
of models, and how they relate to other classical techniques. In addition, a
set of didactic guidelines on how to choose the proper AE for a given task is
supplied, together with a discussion of the software tools available. Finally,
two case studies illustrate the usage of AEs with datasets of handwritten
digits and breast cancer.

analysis. Two of its major limitations are scalability and generalization of
the spectral embedding (i.e., out-of-sample-extension). In this paper we
introduce a deep learning approach to spectral clustering that overcomes the
above shortcomings. Our network, which we call SpectralNet, learns a map that
embeds input data points into the eigenspace of their associated graph
Laplacian matrix and subsequently clusters them. We train SpectralNet using a
procedure that involves constrained stochastic optimization. Stochastic
optimization allows it to scale to large datasets, while the constraints, which
are implemented using a special-purpose output layer, allow us to keep the
network output orthogonal. Moreover, the map learned by SpectralNet naturally
generalizes the spectral embedding to unseen data points. To further improve
the quality of the clustering, we replace the standard pairwise Gaussian
affinities with affinities leaned from unlabeled data using a Siamese network.
Additional improvement can be achieved by applying the network to code
representations produced, e.g., by standard autoencoders. Our end-to-end
learning procedure is fully unsupervised. In addition, we apply VC dimension
theory to derive a lower bound on the size of SpectralNet. State-of-the-art
clustering results are reported on the Reuters dataset. Our implementation is

Moreover, it is not practical to try out as many different hyperparameter

evaluating each single hyperparameter configuration in deep learning would mean
training a deep neural network, which usually takes quite long time. Hyperband
algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on various hyperparameter

to determine the quantum efficiency (QE) and double photoelectron emission

of $\textrm{(32.4$\pm$2.9)%}$ at room temperature, we find a relative
improvement of $\textrm{(17.9$\pm$5.2)%}$ upon cooling (where uncertainty
values refer to the sample standard deviation). The mean DPE probability in
response to single vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photons is
$\textrm{(22.6$\pm$2.0)%}$ at low temperature; the DPE increase relative to
room temperature, measured here for the first time, was
$\textrm{(12.2$\pm$3.9)%}$. Evidence of a small triple photoelectron emission

are established between these parameters and the QE as measured by the

sampling clock offset (SCO) is estimated by using the training symbols reserved

feasibility of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by means of numerical

radiation. Additionally, in response to the abrupt variation in flow and
non-linear Bogoliubov dispersion relation, evanescent solutions of the

Multi-Channel Moving Window Codes (MC-MWC) for multi-channel multi-session

throughput: we show that MC-MWC achieves order-optimal throughput in the
many-user many-channel asymptotic regime. Moreover, the number of channels
required by a conventional channel-allocation based scheme is shown to be
doubly-exponentially larger than that required by MC-MWC. (ii) Low delay: using
large deviations theory, we show that the delay of MC-MWC decreases linearly
with the number of channels, while the delay reduction of conventional schemes
is no more than a finite constant. (iii) Low feedback overhead: the feedback
overhead of MC-MWC is a constant that is independent of both the number of
receivers in each session and the number of sessions in the network. Finally,
our trace-driven simulation and numerical results validate the analytical
results and show that the implementation complexity of MC-MWC is low.

accelerators. It is still an open issue when and how young SNRs, which
typically exhibit strong synchrotron X-rays and GeV and TeV gamma-rays, undergo
the state transition to middle-aged SNRs dominated by thermal X-rays and GeV
gamma-rays. The SNR N132D in the Large Magellanic Cloud is an ideal target to
study such a transition, exhibiting bright X-rays and gamma-rays, and with the
expected age of ~2500 yrs. In this paper we present results of NuSTAR and
Suzaku spectroscopy. We reveal that N132D has a nearly equilibrium plasma with
a temperature of > 5 keV or a recombining plasma with a lower temperature (~1.5
keV) and a recombining timescale (net) of 8.8 (7.0--10.0)e12 cm^-3s. Together
with the center filled morphology observed in the iron K line image, our
results suggest that N132D is now at transition stage from a young SNR to
middle-aged. We have constrained the tight upper-limit of nonthermal X-rays.
Bright gamma-rays compared to faint nonthermal X-rays suggest that the
gamma-rays are hadronic in origin. The spectral energy distribution from radio
to gamma-rays shows a proton cut-off energy of ~30 TeV. These facts confirm
that N132D is in the transition from young to middle-aged SNR. The large
thermal energy of > 10^51 erg and accelerated proton energy of ~ 10^50 erg
suggest the supernova explosion might have been very energetic.

functionality, blockchains have been proposed as one possible solution. Yet
public blockchains are energy inefficient, hard to scale and suffer from
limited throughput and high latencies, while permissioned blockchains depend on
specially designated nodes, potentially leak meta-information, and also suffer
from scale and performance bottlenecks.
  This paper presents CreDB, a datastore that provides blockchain-like
guarantees of integrity using trusted execution environments. CreDB employs
four novel mechanisms to support a new class of applications. First, it creates
a permanent record of every transaction, known as a witness, that clients can
then use not only to audit the database but to prove to third parties that
desired actions took place. Second, it associates with every object an
inseparable and inviolable policy, which not only performs access control but
enables the datastore to implement state machines whose behavior is amenable to
analysis. Third, timeline inspection allows authorized parties to inspect and
reason about the history of changes made to the data. Finally, CreDB provides a
protected function evaluation mechanism that allows integrity-protected
computation over private data. The paper describes these mechanisms, and the
applications they collectively enable, in detail. We have fully implemented a
prototype of CreDB on Intel SGX. Evaluation shows that CreDB can serve as a
drop-in replacement for other NoSQL stores, such as MongoDB while providing
stronger integrity guarantees.

convergence in population-based optimization methods. Island model is widely
considered as a major approach to achieve this because of its flexibility and
high efficiency. The model maintains a group of sub-populations on different
islands and allows sub-populations to interact with each other via predefined
migration policies. However, current island model has some drawbacks. One is
that after a certain number of generations, different islands may retain quite
similar, converged sub-populations thereby losing diversity and decreasing
efficiency. Another drawback is that determining the number of islands to
maintain is also very challenging. Meanwhile initializing many sub-populations
increases the randomness of island model. To address these issues, we proposed
a dynamic island model~(DIM-SP) which can force each island to maintain
different sub-populations, control the number of islands dynamically and starts
with one sub-population. The proposed island model outperforms the other three
state-of-the-art island models in three baseline optimization problems

environment are also self-consistently taken into account. We find that the
slowly rotating flows at large radii can significantly deviate from Bondi
accretion when radiation heating and cooling are considered. We further find
that when the temperature of environment gas is low (e.g. $T=2\times 10^7$K),
the luminosity of hot accretion flows is high. When the temperature of gas is
high (e.g. $T\geq4\times 10^7$K), the luminosity of hot accretion flow
significantly deceases. The environment gas density can also significantly
influence the luminosity of accretion flows. When density is higher than $\sim
4\times 10^{-22}\text{g} \text{cm}^{-3}$ and temperature is lower than $2\times
10^7$K, hot accretion flow with luminosity lower than $2\%L_{\text{Edd}}$ is
not present. Therefore, the pc-scale environment density and temperature are
two important parameters to determine the luminosity. The results are also
useful for the sub-grid models adopted by the cosmological simulations.

their potential capabilities of regulating microscopic turbulences and
associated anomalous transport. This article reviews linear and nonlinear
theories of GAM; with emphases on kinetic treatment, system nonuniformity and
realistic magnetic geometry, in order to reflect the realistic experimental
conditions. Specifically, in the linear physics, the resonant wave-particle
interactions are discussed, with the application to resonant excitation by
energetic particles (EPs). The theory of EP-induced GAM (EGAM) is applied to
realistic devices for the interpretation of experimental observations, and
global effects due to coupling to GAM continuum are also discussed. Meanwhile,
in the nonlinear physics, the spontaneous GAM excitation by microscale
turbulences is reviewed, including the effects of various system
nonuniformities. A unified theoretical framework of GAM/EGAM is then
constructed based on our present understandings. The first-principle-based
GAM/EGAM theories reviewed here, thus, provide the tools needed for the
understanding and interpretation of experimental/numerical results.

remarkable quantum phenomena in topological orders with symmetry, i.e.,
symmetry-enriched topological phases. While much progress has been
theoretically and experimentally made in 2D, the understanding on SF in 3D is
far from complete. A long-standing challenge is to understand SF on looplike
topological excitations which are spatially extended objects. In this work, we
construct a powerful topological-field-theoretical framework approach for 3D
topological orders, which leads to a systematic characterization and
classification of SF. For systems with Abelian gauge groups ($G_g$) and Abelian
symmetry groups ($G_s$), we successfully establish equivalence classes that
lead to a finite number of patterns of SF, although there are notoriously
infinite number of Lagrangian-descriptions of the system. We compute
topologically distinct types of fractional symmetry charges carried by
particles. Then, for each type, we compute topologically distinct statistical
phases of braiding processes among loop excitations and external symmetry
fluxes. As a result, we are able to unambiguously list all physical observables
for each pattern of SF. We present detailed calculations on many concrete
examples. As an example, we find that the SF in an untwisted
$\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order with $\mathbb{Z}_2$
symmetry is classified by $ (\mathbb{Z}_2)^6\oplus (\mathbb{Z}_2)^2\oplus
(\mathbb{Z}_2)^2\oplus (\mathbb{Z}_2)^2$. If the topological order is twisted,
the classification reduces to $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^6$ in which particle excitations
always carry integer charge. Pure algebraic formalism of the classification is
given by: $ \bigoplus_{\nu_i} \mathcal H^4 ( G_g\leftthreetimes_{\nu_i}G_s, U

universality of fermion masses is guaranteed by the fact that Higgs boson is
originally gauge boson in this scenario and also the quantized exponents may be
attributed to the well-known quantization condition of magnetic charge of the

Because of the presence of the magnetic monopole, we get a chiral theory and

term resulting from equipartition of potential energy among the active degrees
of freedom and a wave vector transfer dependent term resulting from the elastic
energy stored by the protein during the neutron scattering event. The elastic
potential energy involves a new elastobaric coefficient that is proportional to
the product of two factors: one factor depends on universal constants and the
other on the incident neutron wave vector per degree of freedom. The ELM was
tested for dry protein samples with an elastobaric coefficient corresponding to
3 degrees of freedom. A discussion of the data requirements for additional
tests of ELM is presented resulting in a call for published data that have not
been preprocessed by temperature and wave-vector dependent normalizations.

deep learning approaches such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Long

methods based on linguistic feature engineering. In this paper, we propose an
attention based neural matching model for ranking short answer text. We adopt
value-shared weighting scheme instead of position-shared weighting scheme for
combining different matching signals and incorporate question term importance
learning using question attention network. Using the popular benchmark TREC QA
data, we show that the relatively simple aNMM model can significantly
outperform other neural network models that have been used for the question

classical partition identities of Euler, Rogers, Ramanujan and Gordon. As a
large part in his paper, Andrews considered the partitions by restricting the
parity of occurrences of even numbers or odd numbers in the
Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon type. The Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon type partition was
defined by Gordon in 1961 as a combinatorial generalization of the
Rogers-Ramaujan identities with odd moduli.
  In 1974, Andrews derived an identity which can be considered as the
generating function counterpart of the Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon theorem, and
since then it has been called the Andrews--Gordon identity. By revisting the
Andrews--Gordon identity Andrews extended his results by considering some
additional restrictions involving parities to obtain some
Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon type theorems and Andrews--Gordon type identities. In
the end of Andrews' paper, he posed $15$ open problems. Most of Andrews' $15$
open problems have been settled, but the $11$th that ""extend the parity indices

the overpartition analogues of the Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon theorem and the
Andrews-Gordon identity. In this paper, we post some parity restrictions on
these overpartitions analogues to get some Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon type
overpartition theorems.

14 about $1\,\mathrm{Myr}$ ago and marks the transition from HII regions to
photo-dissociation regions. With the state-of-the-art Meudon PDR code, we
successfully derive the physical conditions, which include the thermal pressure
($P$) and the scaling factor of radiation fields ($G_{\mathrm{UV}}$), from the
observed CO spectral line energy distributions~(SLEDs) in the observed region.
The derived $G_{\mathrm{UV}}$ values generally show an excellent agreement with
the UV radiation fields created by nearby OB-stars and thus confirm that the
main excitation source of the observed CO emission are the UV-photons provided
by the massive stars. The derived thermal pressure is between
$0.5-3\,\times\,10^{8}\,\mathrm{K\,cm^{-3}}$ with the highest values found
along the ionization front in Car I-E region facing Trumpler 14, hinting that
the cloud structure is similar to the recent observations of the Orion Bar.

Importantly, the only detectable change due to the growth of FeSe films is the

quasiparticles in AC-driven quantum conductors. By incorporating the
Bloch-Messiah reduction into the scattering theory approach to quantum
transport, we construct the many-body state from the scattering matrix, within
which the wave function of quasiparticles can be extracted. We find that two
kinds of quasiparticles can be excited, while both of them are superpositions
of particle and hole states in the Fermi sea. Due to the electron number
conservation, the quasiparticles are always created in pairs, resulting in
particle-hole pair excitations in quantum conductors. We apply our approach to
compare these particle-hole pairs excited in perfectly transparent quantum
contacts and mesoscopic capacitors with single-level quantum dot. For the
quantum contacts, multiple pairs can be excited, while the excitation
probability of each pair increases as the strength of the driving field
increasing. The particle(hole) components are always in phase (180 degrees out
of phase) with the driving field. These features agree with the results
obtained via the extended Keldysh-Green's function technique. For the
mesoscopic capacitors, only one particle-hole pair can be excited, while the
corresponding excitation probability undergoes an oscillation as the strength
of the driving field increasing. A nonzero phase delay between the
particle(hole) component and the driving field exists, which can be tuned via
the dot-lead coupling in the mesoscopic capacitor. These features are very
distinct from the case of quantum contacts, which can be attributed to the
finite dwell time of electrons in the mesoscopic capacitor. We also find that
our approach can also offer a general way to extract the wave function of
quasiparticles from the Wigner function, making it helpful for the signal
processing of relevant experiments in electron quantum optics.

structural brain networks are intrinsically directed because of the nature of
chemical synapses, which comprise most neuronal connections. Due to limitations
of non-invasive imaging techniques, the directionality of connections between
structurally connected regions of the human brain cannot be confirmed. Hence,
connections are represented as undirected, and it is still unknown how this
lack of directionality affects brain network topology. Using six directed brain
networks from different species and parcellations (cat, mouse, C. elegans, and
three macaque networks), we estimate the inaccuracies in network measures
(degree, betweenness, clustering coefficient, path length, global efficiency,
participation index, and small worldness) associated with the removal of the
directionality of connections. We employ three different methods to render
directed brain networks undirected: (i) remove uni-directional connections,
(ii) add reciprocal connections, and (iii) combine equal numbers of removed and
added uni-directional connections. We quantify the extent of inaccuracy in
network measures introduced through neglecting connection directionality for
individual nodes and across the network. We find that the coarse division
between core and peripheral nodes remains accurate for undirected networks.
However, hub nodes differ considerably when directionality is neglected.
Comparing the different methods to generate undirected networks from directed
ones, we generally find that the addition of reciprocal connections (false
positives) causes larger errors in graph-theoretic measures than the removal of
the same number of directed connections (false negatives). These findings
suggest that directionality plays an essential role in shaping brain networks
and highlight some limitations of undirected connectomes.

function of N55 clearly show a turnover below 200M$_{\odot}$, separating the
low-mass end from the high-mass end. The low-mass end of the $^{12}$CO mass

atmospheric band. This, however, makes the latter appealing for balloon and
space observations from above (most of) the Earth's atmosphere. We estimate the
residual effect of the O$_2$ band on the K I $D_2$ line at altitudes typical
for stratospheric balloons. Our aim is to study the feasibility of observing
the 770 nm window. Specifically, this paper serves as a preparation for the
third flight of the Sunrise balloon-borne observatory. The results indicate
that the absorption by O$_2$ is still present, albeit much weaker, at the
expected balloon altitude. We applied the obtained O$_2$ transmittance to K I
$D_2$ synthetic polarimetric spectra and found that in the absence of
line-of-sight motions, the residual O$_2$ has a negligible effect on the K I
$D_2$ line. On the other hand, for Doppler-shifted K I $D_2$ data, the residual
O$_2$ might alter the shape of the Stokes profiles. However, the residual O$_2$
absorption is sufficiently weak at stratospheric levels that it can be divided
out if appropriate measurements are made, something that is impossible at
ground level. Therefore, for the first time with Sunrise III, we will be able
to perform polarimetric observations of the K I $D_2$ line and, consequently,
we will have improved access to the thermodynamics and magnetic properties of
the upper photosphere from observations of the K I lines.

proposed in which only a single dual variable is communicated with the

algorithm is simple and no specific initialization is necessary, and this in
turn allows on-line change of network structure, demand, generation

quantum dots attached to the spin-polarized leads. The principle of operation
of the demon is based on the coherent oscillations between the spin states of
the system which act as a quantum iSWAP gate. Due to the operation of the iSWAP
gate one of the dots acts as a feedback controller which blocks the transport
with the bias in the other dot, thus inducing the electron pumping against the
bias; this leads to the locally negative entropy production. Operation of the
demon is associated with the information transfer between the dots, which is
studied quantitatively by mapping the analyzed setup onto the thermodynamically
equivalent auxiliary system. The calculated entropy production in a single
subsystem and information flow between the subsystems are shown to obey a local
form of the second law of thermodynamics, similar to the one previously derived
for classical bipartite systems.

social-media users, which captures the political leaning of the content shared

a large degree, exposed to political opinions that agree with their own. We
also find that users who try to bridge the echo chambers, by sharing content

'gatekeepers', users who consume content with diverse leaning but produce
partisan content (with a single-sided leaning), in the formation of echo

strong-backscattering phase function, i.e., a negative scattering asymmetry
parameter $g$, is of great interest which can possibly achieve unusual
radiative transport phenomena, for instance, Anderson localization of light.
Based on the multipole expansion of Foldy-Lax equations and quasicrystalline
approximation (QCA), we have rigorously derived analytical expressions for
effective propagation constant and scattering phase function for a random
system containing dual-dipolar particles, by taking the effect of structural
correlations into account. Here we demonstrate that by utilizing structural
correlations and the second Kerker condition for a disordered medium composed
of randomly distributed silicon nanoparticles, a strongly negative scattering
asymmetry factor ($g\sim-0.5$) for multiple light scattering can be realized in
the near-infrared. As concentration of scattering particles rises, the
backscattering is also enhanced. Moreover, we show that in this circumstance,
transport mean free path is largely reduced and even smaller than that
predicted by independent scattering approximation. We further explored the
dependent scattering effects, including the modification of electric and
magnetic dipole excitations and far-field interference effect, both induced by
the structural correlations, for volume fraction of particles up to

capable of estimating the internal forces based solely on inertial motion
capture (IMC) input and a ground reaction force and moment (GRF&M) prediction

against an equally constructed musculoskeletal model driven by OMC and FP
system. The sagittal plane joint angles of ankle, knee, and hip presented
excellent Pearson correlations (\rho = 0.95, 0.99, and 0.99, respectively) and
root-mean-squared differences (RMSD) of 4.1 $\pm$ 1.3$\circ$, 4.4 $\pm$

RMSD=5.5 $\pm$ 1.2 %BW, sagittal: \rho = 0.91, RMSD=1.6 $\pm$ 0.6 %BW*BH), and
strong correlations for mediolateral (\rho = 0.80, RMSD=2.1 $\pm$ 0.6%BW ) and
transverse (\rho = 0.82, RMSD=0.2 $\pm$ 0.1 %BW*BH). The proposed IMC-based
method removes the complexity and space-restrictions of OMC and FP systems and
could enable applications of musculoskeletal models in either monitoring

nearly 100% conversion efficiency. A small threshold energy, as low as twice
the bandgap, was achieved, marking an onset of quantum yield with enhanced

problem. However, existing solutions to this problem rely on human experts to
define features and often miss many vulnerabilities (i.e., incurring high false
negative rate). In this paper, we initiate the study of using deep
learning-based vulnerability detection to relieve human experts from the
tedious and subjective task of manually defining features. Since deep learning
is motivated to deal with problems that are very different from the problem of
vulnerability detection, we need some guiding principles for applying deep
learning to vulnerability detection. In particular, we need to find
representations of software programs that are suitable for deep learning. For
this purpose, we propose using code gadgets to represent programs and then
transform them into vectors, where a code gadget is a number of (not
necessarily consecutive) lines of code that are semantically related to each
other. This leads to the design and implementation of a deep learning-based
vulnerability detection system, called Vulnerability Deep Pecker
(VulDeePecker). In order to evaluate VulDeePecker, we present the first
vulnerability dataset for deep learning approaches. Experimental results show
that VulDeePecker can achieve much fewer false negatives (with reasonable false
positives) than other approaches. We further apply VulDeePecker to 3 software
products (namely Xen, Seamonkey, and Libav) and detect 4 vulnerabilities, which
are not reported in the National Vulnerability Database but were ""silently""
patched by the vendors when releasing later versions of these products; in
contrast, these vulnerabilities are almost entirely missed by the other
vulnerability detection systems we experimented with.

which the objective is to reconfigure a swarm of labeled convex objects by a

target arrangement. Problems of this type can be traced back to the classic
work of Schwartz and Sharir (1983), who gave a method for deciding the
existence of a coordinated motion for a set of disks between obstacles; their
approach is polynomial in the complexity of the obstacles, but exponential in
the number of disks. Other previous work has largely focused on {\em
sequential} schedules, in which one robot moves at a time.
  We provide constant-factor approximation algorithms for minimizing the
execution time of a coordinated, {\em parallel} motion plan for a swarm of
robots in the absence of obstacles, provided some amount of separability.
  Our algorithm achieves {\em constant stretch factor}: If all robots are at
most $d$ units from their respective starting positions, the total duration of
the overall schedule is $O(d)$. Extensions include unlabeled robots and
different classes of robots. We also prove that finding a plan with minimal
execution time is NP-hard, even for a grid arrangement without any stationary
obstacles. On the other hand, we show that for densely packed disks that cannot
be well separated, a stretch factor $\Omega(N^{1/4})$ may be required. On the
positive side, we establish a stretch factor of $O(N^{1/2})$ even in this case.

consider in order to obtain reliable results. For example, seasonality is often
accounted for in statistical models because climatic oscillations occurring
every year have an obvious impact on river flow. Further sources of alteration
could be caused by changes in reservoir management, instrumentation or even
unexpected shifts in climatic conditions. When these changes are ignored the
statistical results can be strongly misleading. This paper develops an
automatic procedure to estimate number and locations of changepoints in
Periodic AutoRegressive models. These latter have been extensively used for
modelling seasonality in hydrology, climatology, economics and electrical
engineering, but there are very few papers devoted also to changepoints
detection, moreover being limited to changes in mean or variance. In our
proposal we allow the model structure as a whole to change, and estimation is
performed by optimizing an objective function derived from the Information
Criterion using Genetic Algorithms. The proposed methodology is brought out
through the example of three river flows, for which we built models with
possible changepoints and evaluated their forecasting accuracy by means of Root
Mean Square Error, Mean Absolute Error and Mean Absolute Percentage Error. The
last years of data sets have been omitted from the selection and estimation
procedure and were then used to forecast. Comparisons with literature on river

in Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)- secured communication through using rapidly
rekeyed Internet Protocol security (IPsec) links. QKD is a cutting-edge
security technology that provides mathematically proven security by using
quantum physical effects and information theoretical axioms to generate a
guaranteed non-disclosed stream of encryption keys. Although it has been a
field of theoretical research for some time, it has only been producing
market-ready solutions for a short period of time. The downside of this
technology is that its key generation rate is only around 52,000 key bits per
second over a distance of 50 km. As this rate limits the data throughput to the
same rate, it is substandard for normal modern communications, especially for
securely interconnecting networks. IPsec, on the other hand, is a well-known
security protocol that uses classical encryption and is capable of exactly
creating site-to-site virtual private networks. This paper presents a solution
that combines the performance advantages of IPsec with QKD. The combination
sacrifices only a small portion of QKD security by using the generated keys a
limited number of times instead of just once. As a part of this, the solution
answers the question of how many data bits per key bit make sensible upper and
lower boundaries to yield high performance while maintaining high security.
While previous approaches complement the Internet Key Exchange protocol (IKE),
this approach simplifies the implementation with a new key synchronization
concept, proposing a lightweight protocol that uses relatively few, slim
control messages and sparse acknowledgement. Furthermore, it provides a

to capture a given percentage of the total intra-individual variability. Also,
if more precise time scales can be obtained in future, these may aid the
characterization of physiological processes underlying various EEG measures.
Heterogeneity of the subject group was constrained by testing only healthy
males in a narrow age range (mean = 22.3 years, sd = 2.7). Resting eyes-closed
EEGs of 32 subjects were recorded at weekly intervals over an approximately
six-week period. Of these, 13 subjects had follow-up recordings spanning up to
a year. QEEG measures, computed from Cz spectra, were powers in five frequency
bands, alpha peak frequency, and spectral entropy. Of these, theta, alpha, and
beta band powers were most reproducible. Of nine model parameters obtained by
fitting model predictions to experiment, the most reproducible ones quantified
the total power and the time delay between cortex and thalamus. About 95% of
the maximum change in spectral parameters was reached within minutes of
recording time, implying that repeat recordings are not necessary to capture
the bulk of the variability in EEG spectra likely to occur in the resting

methodology, the Spectral Graph Forge, for generating random graphs that
preserves community structure from a real network of interest, in terms of

matrix representations of a graph encodes global information about community
structure. The Spectral Graph Forge uses a low-rank approximation of the
modularity matrix to generate synthetic graphs that match a target modularity
within user-selectable degree of accuracy, while allowing other aspects of
structure to vary. We show that the Spectral Graph Forge outperforms
state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy in targeting the modularity

availability of large-scale real-world image annotations obtained by cumbersome
human labors. Moreover, the perception performance often drops significantly
for new scenarios, due to the poor generalization capability of models trained
on limited and biased annotations. In this work, we resort to transfer
knowledge from automatically rendered scene annotations in virtual-world to
facilitate real-world visual tasks. Although virtual-world annotations can be
ideally diverse and unlimited, the discrepant data distributions between
virtual and real-world make it challenging for knowledge transferring. We thus
propose a novel Semantic-aware Grad-GAN (SG-GAN) to perform virtual-to-real
domain adaption with the ability of retaining vital semantic information.
Beyond the simple holistic color/texture transformation achieved by prior
works, SG-GAN successfully personalizes the appearance adaption for each
semantic region in order to preserve their key characteristic for better
recognition. It presents two main contributions to traditional GANs: 1) a soft
gradient-sensitive objective for keeping semantic boundaries; 2) a
semantic-aware discriminator for validating the fidelity of personalized
adaptions with respect to each semantic region. Qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our SG-GAN in scene adaption over
state-of-the-art GANs. Further evaluations on semantic segmentation on
Cityscapes show using adapted virtual images by SG-GAN dramatically improves
segmentation performance than original virtual data. We release our code at

Feynman diagrams contain propagators with different mass scales and decoupling
scales must be chosen appropriately to absorb threshold corrections. On the
other hand, in the two-scalar model, the mass matrix of the scalar fields is a
function of their field values $(\varphi, h)$ and the resultant running
couplings obey different RGEs on a different point of the field space. By
solving the RGEs, we can obtain the RG improved effective action in the whole

alternative from a multitude of options. Evaluating pairwise comparisons breaks
down such complex decision problems into tractable ones. Pairwise comparison
matrices (PCMs) are regularly used to solve multiple-criteria decision-making
(MCDM) problems, for example, using Saaty's analytic hierarchy process (AHP)
framework. However, there are two significant drawbacks of using PCMs. First,
humans evaluate PCMs in an inconsistent manner. Second, not all entries of a
large PCM can be reliably filled by human decision makers. We address these two
issues by first establishing a novel connection between PCMs and
time-irreversible Markov processes. Specifically, we show that every PCM
induces a family of dissipative maximum path entropy random walks (MERW) over
the set of alternatives. We show that only `consistent' PCMs correspond to
detailed balanced MERWs. We identify the non-equilibrium entropy production in
the induced MERWs as a metric of inconsistency of the underlying PCMs. Notably,
the entropy production satisfies all of the recently laid out criteria for
reasonable consistency indices. We also propose an approach to use incompletely
filled PCMs in AHP. Potential future avenues are discussed as well.

relevant information carried by the input is the combinatorial configuration of
the points: the orientation of each triple of points in the set (clockwise,
counterclockwise, or collinear). This information is called the order type of
the point set. In the dual, realizable order types and abstract order types are
combinatorial analogues of line arrangements and pseudoline arrangements. Too
often in the literature we analyze algorithms in the real-RAM model for
simplicity, putting aside the fact that computers as we know them cannot handle
arbitrary real numbers without some sort of encoding. Encoding an order type by
the integer coordinates of some realizing point set is known to yield doubly
exponential coordinates in some cases. Other known encodings can achieve
quadratic space or fast orientation queries, but not both. In this
contribution, we give a compact encoding for abstract order types that allows
efficient query of the orientation of any triple: the encoding uses O(n^2) bits
and an orientation query takes O(log n) time in the word-RAM model. This
encoding is space-optimal for abstract order types. We show how to shorten the
encoding to O(n^2 (loglog n)^2 / log n) bits for realizable order types, giving
the first subquadratic encoding for those order types with fast orientation
queries. We further refine our encoding to attain O(log n/loglog n) query time
without blowing up the space requirement. In the realizable case, we show that
all those encodings can be computed efficiently. Finally, we generalize our
results to the encoding of point configurations in higher dimension.

Quantification (UQ) is the process to inversely quantify input uncertainties

Bayesian analysis to establish the inverse UQ formulation, with systematic and
rigorously derived metamodels constructed by Gaussian Process (GP). Due to
incomplete or inaccurate underlying physics, as well as numerical approximation
errors, computer models always have discrepancy/bias in representing the
realities, which can cause over-fitting if neglected in the inverse UQ process.
The model discrepancy term is accounted for in our formulation through the
""model updating equation"". We provided a detailed introduction and comparison

out their limitations when extrapolated to the validation/prediction domain.

perturbations such as quantum dots or excitons in 2D materials. For
illustration purposes, we analytically evaluate our expressions for some simple

resonance. Finally, we show how the perturbation of a periodic system with a

this provides an avenue to perturbatively treat quite general material loss

the past years. To meet all future claims rising from policies, it is requisite
to quantify the outstanding loss liabilities. Loss reserving methods based on
aggregated data from run-off triangles are predominantly used to calculate the
claims reserves. Conventional reserving techniques have some disadvantages:
loss of information from the policy and the claim's development due to the
aggregation, zero or negative cells in the triangle; usually small number of
observations in the triangle; only few observations for recent accident years;
and sensitivity to the most recent paid claims.
  To overcome these dilemmas, granular loss reserving methods for individual
claim-by-claim data will be derived. Reserves' estimation is a crucial part of
the risk valuation process, which is now a front burner in economics. Since
there is a growing demand for prediction of total reserves for different types
of claims or even multiple lines of business, a time-varying copula framework
for granular reserving will be established.

known as the Price of Fairness ($PoF$). In wireless scheduling, $PoF$ increases
when serving users with very poor channel quality because the scheduler wastes
resources trying to be fair. This paper proposes a novel resource allocation
framework to rigorously address this issue. We introduce selective fairness:
being fair only to selected users, and improving $PoF$ by momentarily blocking
the rest. We study the associated admission control problem of finding the user
selection that minimizes $PoF$ subject to selective fairness, and show that
this combinatorial problem can be solved efficiently if the feasibility set
satisfies a condition; in our model it suffices that the wireless channels are
stochastically dominated. Exploiting selective fairness, we design a stochastic
framework where we minimize $PoF$ subject to an SLA, which ensures that an
ergodic subscriber is served frequently enough. In this context, we propose an
online policy that combines the drift-plus-penalty technique with
Gradient-Based Scheduling experts, and we prove it achieves the optimal $PoF$.
Simulations show that our intelligent blocking outperforms by 40$\%$ in
throughput previous approaches which satisfy the SLA by blocking low-SNR users.

tools of quadratic optomechanical interactions, as one of the prominent domains
of contemporary nonlinear quantum optics. Emphasis has been put here first to
show what types of nonlinear interactions do exist, and what physical
interpretations follow each. The standard quadratic interactions between light
and mechanical motion is expressed as the product of cavity light intensity and
squared mirror position. However, there exists a non-standard quadratic
optomechanical interaction as well, which assumes a mathematically different
form and appears as the squared product of field and mirror momenta. This
non-standard type of quadratic interaction originates from two corrections: the
momentum exchange and conservation among mirror and field, as well as
relativistic corrections due to different mechanisms. Both these types of
non-standard interactions become relevant when the ratio of mechanical to
optical frequency is no longer negligible. Next, we turn to the solution
technique of such interactions, and introduce a formal higher-order operator
method to tackle the nonlinear evolution of quantum systems. This enables one
to accurately study any type of quantum nonlinear interaction using the
analysis tools of linear algebra. In order to employ the analytical power of
higher-order operator method, one first needs to identify a closed Lie algebra,
which should satisfy closedness property under commutation either exactly or
approximately, and is referred to as the basis. Having the basis of
higher-order operators known, one may proceed to construct the corresponding
Langevin equations, which can be now conveniently analyzed using the existing
mathematical toolbox of linear algebra to yield the spectral densities,
moments, and expectation values.

  We first show that in symmetric networks a Greedy policy, which transmits the

three low-complexity scheduling policies: a randomized policy, a Max-Weight

and compared with autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models that use the
differences between DALMP and RTLMP on their forecasting capability. A
generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model is
implemented to further improve the forecasting by accounting for the price
volatility. The models are trained and evaluated using real market data in the
Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) region. The evaluation results
indicate that the ARMAX-GARCH model, where an exogenous time series indicates
weekend days, improves the short-term electricity price prediction accuracy and
outperforms the other proposed ARIMA models

with a fluctuational nonunitary counterpart of the latter. Fundamental
nonunitarity can be seen as arising from the interaction of the physical

for the system as a whole takes place, with a small modulation induced on the
relative entanglement entropy of the two particles. Besides, the simulation
shows explicitly how fundamental gravity-induced entropy can be clearly

combine traffic flow theory with neural networks and thus improve the accuracy

Networks (LSTM NNs) which capture correlation in time and space among traffic
flow and traffic density. One of the LSTM NNs, called a discriminative network,
aims to maximize the probability of assigning correct labels to both true
traffic state matrices (i.e., traffic flow and traffic density within a given
spatial-temporal area) and the traffic state matrices generated from the other
neural network. The other LSTM NN, called a generative network, aims to
generate traffic state matrices which maximize the probability that the
discriminative network assigns true labels to them. The two LSTM NNs are
trained simultaneously such that the trained generative network can generate
traffic matrices similar to those in the training data set. Given a traffic
state matrix with missing values, we use back-propagation on three defined loss
functions to map the corrupted matrix to a latent space. The mapping vector is
then passed through the pre-trained generative network to estimate the missing
values of the corrupted matrix. The proposed GAA is compared with the existing
Bayesian network approach on loop detector data collected from Seattle,
Washington and that collected from San Diego, California. Experimental results
indicate that the GAA can achieve higher accuracy in traffic state estimation

discretization. The proposed ADI scheme is validated by considering benchmark
examples with exact solutions and by solvation analysis of real biomolecules
with various sizes. Numerical results are in good agreement with the

hypothesize that the use of pixel coordinates will lead to (a) Resolution
invariant performance. Here, by resolution we mean the spacing between the
pixels rather than the size of the image matrix. (b) Overall improvement in
classification accuracy in comparison with network models trained without local
pixel coordinates. This is due to position coordinates enabling the network to
learn relationship between parts of objects, mimicking the human vision system.
We demonstrate our hypothesis using empirical results and intuitive
explanations of the feature maps learnt by deep neural networks. Specifically,
our approach showed improvements in MNIST digit classification and beats state
of the results on the SVHN database. We also show that the performance of our
networks is unaffected despite training the same using blurred images of the
MNIST database and predicting on the high resolution database.

  Opportunities","Survey of Automatic Comment Generation for Source Code",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Researches have shown that most effort of today's software development is
maintenance and evolution. Developers often use integrated development
environments, debuggers, and tools for code search, testing, and program
understanding to reduce the tedious tasks. One way to make software development
more efficient is to make the program more readable. There have been many
approaches proposed and developed for this purpose. Among these approaches,
comment generation for source code is gaining more and more attention and has
become a popular research area. In this paper, the state of art in comment
generation research area are summarized and the challenges and future
opportunities are discussed.

\emph{superrationality}. We start by defining superrationally justifiable
actions, and study them in symmetric games. We then model the beliefs of the
players, in a way that leads them to different choices than the usual
assumption of rationality by restricting the range of conceivable choices.
These beliefs are captured in the formal notion of \emph{type} drawn from
epistemic game theory. The theory of coalgebras is used to frame type spaces
and to account for the existence of some of them. We find conditions that
guarantee superrational outcomes.
