manipulation of resources in quantum information processing such as

quantum measurements. Given a certain state or measurement, one can ask whether
there is a task in which it performs better than any resourceless state or

NuSTAR data, thus allowing us to constrain with unprecedented quality important
spectral parameters such as the obscuring torus line-of-sight column density
(N_{H, z}), the average torus column density (N_{H, tor}) and the torus
covering factor (f_c). We compare the best-fit results obtained with the widely
used MyTorus (Murphy et al. 2009) model with those of the recently published
borus02 model (Balokovic et al. 2018) used in the same geometrical
configuration of MyTorus (i.e., with f_c=0.5). We find a remarkable agreement
between the two, although with increasing dispersion in N_{H, z} moving towards
higher column densities. We then use borus02 to measure f_c. High-f_c sources
have, on average, smaller offset between N_{H, z} and N_{H, tor} than low-f_c
ones. Therefore, low f_c values can be linked to a ""patchy torus"" scenario,
where the AGN is seen through an over-dense region in the torus, while high-f_c
objects are more likely to be obscured by a more uniform gas distribution.
Finally, we find potential evidence of an inverse trend between f_c and the AGN
2-10 keV luminosity, i.e., sources with higher f_c values have on average lower

capabilities of ones with a single neuron type. We study inhibitory networks of
concave leaky (LIF) and convex ""anti-leaky"" (XIF) integrate-and-fire neurons

with simple conductance-based synapses for XIF neurons, our networks can
generate a balanced state of irregular asynchronous spiking as well. We
determine the voltage probability distributions and self-consistent firing

compute the full spectrum of Lyapunov exponents (LEs) and the covariant
Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) specifying the corresponding perturbation directions.
We find that there is approximately one positive LE for each XIF neuron. This
indicates in particular that a single XIF neuron renders the network dynamics

the CLVs, explains the finding. As an application, we propose a spike-based

investigated potential heating sources by comparing our measurements to models

different distance measures and representations can be inferred from different

traditional and powerful tool to investigate some of the basic properties of

quasinormal modes, the scattering and the production of waves in a process of
gravitational collapse. Since long ago, the physical interpretation of the
linear fluctuations in the metric of spherically symmetric black holes has been
established. In a multipolar expansion, it is known that polar perturbations of
a monopole type ($l=0$) can only increase the black-hole mass, axial
perturbations of a dipole type ($l=1$) induce a slow rotation in the system,
and perturbations with $l\geq 2$ always lead to the production of gravitational
waves. However, in relation to the planar Schwarzschild anti--de Sitter black
holes (or black branes, for short), there is still no conclusive study on some
aspects of the physical meaning of these perturbations. In particular, there is
some controversy concerning the polar sector of fluctuations with zero wave
number $(k=0)$. Some authors claim that this kind of perturbations causes only
a variation in the black-brane mass parameter, while others obtained also
evidence for the existence of gravitational waves associated to such modes. The
present study aims to contribute to the resolution of this controversy by
revealing the physical meaning of the gravitational perturbations of anti--de
Sitter black branes. In this work we use the Chandrasekhar's gauge formalism to
evaluate the linear variations in the complex Weyl scalars in terms of the
Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli gauge-invariant quantities. Then we use the Szekeres'
proposal for the meaning of the Weyl scalars and the Pirani's criterion for the
existence of gravitational radiation in order to give a physical interpretation

large games that arise from, e.g., social networks and advertising, we initiate
the study of sublinear time property testing algorithms for existence and
verification problems under several notions of coalition stability in a model
of hedonic games represented by graphs with bounded degree. In graph property
testing, one shall decide whether a given input has a property (e.g., a game
admits a stable coalition structure) or is far from it, i.e., one has to modify
at least an $\epsilon$-fraction of the input (e.g., the game's preferences) to
make it have the property. In particular, we consider verification of
perfection, individual rationality, Nash stability, (contractual) individual
stability, and core stability. While there is always a Nash-stable coalition
structure (which also implies individually stable coalitions), we show that the
existence of a perfect coalition structure is not tautological but can be
tested. All our testers have one-sided error and time complexity that is

introduces a general framework for multiple inference in linear mixed models
for cluster specific predictors. Consistent confidence sets for multiple

Furthermore, it is shown that, remarkably, corresponding multiple marginal

More generally, the description of baryons made out of predominantly one flavor
within the Skyrmion model is unsatisfactory. We propose a model for such
baryons, where the baryons are interpreted as quantum Hall droplets. An
important element in our construction is an extended, 2+1 dimensional,
meta-stable configuration of the $\eta'$ particle. Baryon number is identified
with a magnetic symmetry on the 2+1 dimensional sheet. If the sheet has a
boundary, there are finite energy chiral excitations which carry baryon number.
These chiral excitations are analogous to the electron in the fractional
quantum Hall effect. Studying the chiral vertex operators we are able to
determine the spin, isospin, and certain excitations of the droplet. In
addition, balancing the tension of the droplet against the energy stored at the
boundary we estimate the size and mass of the baryons. The mass, size, spin,

While their bias is well understood in the case of a simple Universe composed
dominantly of dark matter, the relation becomes more complex in the presence of
massive neutrinos. Indeed massive neutrinos introduce rich dynamics in the
process of structure formation leading to scale-dependent bias. We study this
process from the perspective of general relativity employing a simple spherical
collapse model. We find a characteristic signature at the neutrino
free-streaming scale in addition to a large-scale feature from general
relativity. The scale-dependent halo bias opposes the suppression in the matter
distribution due to neutrino free-streaming and leads to corrections of a few
percent in the halo power spectrum. It is not only sensitive to the sum of the
neutrino-masses, but respond to the individual masses. Accurate models for the
neutrino bias are a crucial ingredient for the future data analysis and play an
important role in constraining the neutrino masses.

to the ab initio description of the electronic structure of carbon
nanomaterials, such as graphene. Such low-dimensional Hubbard models are
advantageously studied with Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, such as Hybrid

performs continuous, global updates of the lattice degrees of freedom, it
provides superior scaling with system size relative to local updating methods.
A potential drawback of HMC is its susceptibility to ergodicity problems due to
so-called exceptional configurations, for which the fermion operator cannot be
inverted. Recently, ergodicity problems were found in some formulations of HMC
simulations of the Hubbard model. Here, we address this issue directly and
clarify under what conditions ergodicity is maintained or violated in HMC

the fermion operator and provide explicit, representative calculations for
small systems, often comparing to exact results. We show that a fermion
operator can be found which is both computationally convenient and free of

calculated for arbitrary CSS codes with the experimentally important constraint
of using only transversal static linear-optical BMs on the physical
single-photon qubit level. For this purpose, we utilize the codes' description
in terms of stabilizers in order to calculate general efficiencies for the
loss-free case, but also for specific cases including photon loss. These
efficiencies can be, for instance, used for obtaining transmission rates of
all-optical quantum repeaters. In the loss-free case, we demonstrate that the
important class of CSS codes with identical physical-qubit support for the two
logical Pauli ($Z$ and $X$) operators can only achieve a logical BM efficiency
of $\frac{1}{2}$ if one always employs the same ancilla-free static linear
optical BMs on the physical level. We apply our methods to various CSS codes
including two-dimensional planar color and planar surface codes. We then find
that in many cases, the fixed use of the standard linear optical BM for all
physical BMs is suboptimal and performing linear optical transformations before
doing the standard linear optical BM (still without any ancillary photons and
without any feedforward) can increase the efficiency enormously. In fact, using
this generalization in the no-loss (or sometimes also in the low-loss) case
allows us, on the one hand, to improve the logical BM efficiency of quantum
parity codes compared to previously known results and, on the other hand, it
also enables us to enhance the efficiency of two-dimensional planar color
codes, whose efficiency is otherwise subject to the above $\frac{1}{2}$ bound,
to arbitrarily close to unity.

derivation of LAD in 1938. We present a candidate for new equations of motion

that Dirac's derivation relies on an unjustified application of Stokes' theorem

charge model that does allow for the application of Stokes' theorem and enables
us to find an explicit equation of motion by adapting Parrott's derivation,
thus avoiding a Taylor expansion. The result are second order differential
delay equations, which describe the radiation reaction force for the charge

multiresolution bases are used in adaptive algorithms so that basis functions
are selected from a fixed collection of functions, large enough as to
approximate solutions within any user-selected accuracy.
  Our new method achieves adaptivity without using a multiresolution basis.
Instead, as a part of an iteration to solve nonlinear equations, our algorithm
selects the ""best"" subset of linearly independent terms of a Gaussian mixture
from a collection that is much larger than any possible basis since the
locations and shapes of the Gaussian terms are not fixed in advance.
Approximating an orbital within a given accuracy, our algorithm yields
significantly fewer terms than methods using multiresolution bases.
  We demonstrate our approach by solving the Hartree-Fock equations for two
diatomic molecules, HeH+ and LiH, matching the accuracy previously obtained
using multiwavelet bases.

retarded finite-temperature correlation functions of a dual quantum field
theory in the limit of infinite number of relevant degrees of freedom such as
colours. For asymptotically anti-de Sitter backgrounds, the spectra form a
characteristic pattern in the complex frequency plane, colloquially known as
the ""Christmas tree"". At infinite coupling, the tree has only one pair of
branches. At large but finite coupling, the branches become more dense and lift
up towards the real axis, consistent with the expectation of forming a branch
cut in the limit of zero coupling. However, it is known that at zero coupling,
the corresponding correlators generically have not one but multiple branch cuts
separated by intervals proportional to the Matsubara frequency. This suggests
the existence of multiple branches of the ""Christmas tree"" spectrum in dual
gravity. In this note, we show numerically how these additional branches of the
spectrum can emerge from the dual gravitational action with higher-derivative
terms. This phenomenon appears to be robust, yet, reproducing the expected weak
coupling behaviour of the correlators quantitatively implies the existence of
certain constraints on the coefficients of the higher-derivative terms of the
dual gravity theory.

they can suitably represent the behavior of gravitational interaction in the

cosmological effects which could be important to describe the dark energy
behavior. In particular, exponential forms of the distortion function seem
particularly useful for this purpose. Using Noether Symmetries, it can be shown
that the only non-trivial form of the distortion function is the exponential
one, which is working not only for cosmological mini-superspaces, but also in a
spherically symmetric spacetime. Taking this result into account, we study the
weak field approximation of this type of non-local gravity, and comparing with
the orbits of S2 stars around the Galactic center (NTT/VLT data), we set
constraints on the parameters of the theory. Non-local effects do not play a
significant role on the orbits of S2 stars around Sgr A*, but give richer
phenomenology at cosmological scales than the $\Lambda$CDM model. Also, we show
that non-local gravity model gives better agreement between theory and

rank, in the context of classical and quantum exact communication complexity.
In particular, we consider two types of communication problems that we call
promise equality and list problems. For both of these, it was already known
that the one-round classical and one-round quantum complexities are
characterized by the chromatic number and orthogonal rank of a certain graph,
respectively.
  In a promise equality problem, Alice and Bob must decide if their inputs are
equal or not. We prove that classical protocols for such problems can always be
reduced to one-round protocols with no extra communication. In contrast, we
give an explicit instance of a promise equality problem that exhibits an
exponential gap between the one- and two-round exact quantum communication
complexities. Whereas the chromatic number thus fully captures the complexity
of promise equality problems, the hierarchy of ""quantum chromatic numbers""
(starting with the orthogonal rank) giving the quantum communication complexity
for every fixed number of communication rounds turns out to enjoy a much richer
structure.
  In a list problem, Bob gets a subset of some finite universe, Alice gets an
element from Bob's subset, and their goal is for Bob to learn which element
Alice was given. The best general lower bound (due to Orlitsky) and upper bound
(due to Naor, Orlitsky, and Shor) on the classical communication complexity of
such problems differ only by a constant factor. We exhibit an example showing
that, somewhat surprisingly, the four-round protocol used in the bound of Naor
et al. can in fact be optimal. Finally, we pose a conjecture on the
orthogonality rank of a certain graph whose truth would imply an intriguing
impossibility of round elimination in quantum protocols for list problems,
something that works trivially in the classical case.

measurements of TSI by space borne sensors have been carried out since late

aperture, but this construction flaw can be corrected for. At the AGU 2018
meeting, a new TSI composite has been proposed based on a novel mathematical
method vetted by representatives from all current and most past TSI
instruments. Although an 'official' release of the dataset has not been offered
yet, a preliminary version is available. Anticipating that any last-minute
changes might be minor, I compare this new version with the magnetic flux
composite. It is clear that we have two TSI populations: values before 1993
that are seriously too low and values from 1993 onwards. I elect to normalize
the magnetic flux (the driver of variations of TSI) to a New TSI using the
regression equation for the recent population with the smallest uncertainty.
With this normalization, there is now total agreement between the variation of
the magnetic flux and of the New TSI as well as with the F10.7 and Group Number
proxies. We now have two choices: (1) the Sun underwent a dramatic change in
how its magnetic field drives variation of TSI or (2) the New Consensus TSI
reconstruction does not work and the new dataset is premature and not useful
neither for solar nor for climate research. Following David Hume, we should
always believe whatever would be the lesser miracle, which in our case would be
choice (2).

geometrical phase, associated with the energy-momentum band structure. The
quantization of the Berry phase, and the associated wavefunction polarization,
manifest themselves as remarkably robust physical observables, such as
quantized Hall conductivity and disorder-insensitive photonic transport.
Recently, a novel class of topological phases, called higher-order topological
phases, were proposed by generalizing the fundamental relationship between the
Berry phase and the quantized polarization, from dipole to multipole moments.
Here, we demonstrate the first photonic realization of the quantized quadrupole
topological phase, using silicon photonics. In this 2nd-order topological
phase, the quantization of the bulk quadrupole moment in a two-dimensional
system manifests as topologically robust corner states. We unambiguously show
the presence of localized corner states and establish their robustness against
certain defects. Furthermore, we contrast these topological states against
topologically-trivial corner states, in a system without bulk quadrupole
moment, and observe no robustness. Our photonic platform could enable the
development of robust on-chip classical and quantum optical devices with
higher-order topological protection.

predicted dose for each axial slice independently. One predicted dose as a RGB

third GAN model predicted scalar doses for the full 3D CT image at once,
considering correlations between adjacent CT slices. For all models, we also
investigated the impact of scaling the GAN predictions before optimization.
Each GAN model was trained on 130 previously delivered oropharyngeal treatment
plans. Performance was tested on 87 out-of-sample plans, by evaluating using
clinical planning criteria and compared to their corresponding clinical plans.
  The best performing KBAP plans were generated with the 3D GAN, which
predicted dose values followed by scaling. These plans satisfied close to 77%
of all clinical criteria, compared to the clinical plans, which satisfied 64%
of all criteria. Additionally, these KBAP plans satisfied the same criteria as
the clinical plans 84% more frequently compared to the 2D GAN model using RGB
dose prediction. The 3D GAN predictions were also more similar to the final
plan compared to the other approaches, as it better captured the vertical
dosimetric relationship between adjacent axial slices. The deliverable plans
better captured implicit constraints associated with physical deliverability.
Overall, our final plans had superior performance in satisfying clinical

equation in an infinite-dimensional space ${\cal V}$ of analytic functions of a
single complex variable. We argue that in a unitary theory, functions in ${\cal

basis for ${\cal V}$, consisting of bulk and boundary conformal blocks with
scaling dimensions which appear in OPEs of the mean field theory correlator.
Our main achievement is an explicit expression for the action of the dual basis

The practical merit of our basis is that it trivializes the study of
perturbations around mean field theory. Our results are equivalent to a BCFT
version of the Polyakov bootstrap. Our derivation of the expressions for the
functionals relies on the identification of the Polyakov blocks with (suitably
improved) boundary and bulk Witten exchange diagrams in $AdS_{d+1}$. We also
provide another conceptual perspective on the Polyakov block expansion and the

source and show that, upon Bose-Einstein condensation, there is an emergent
long-range interaction between sources. This interaction becomes long-range in
the limit of vanishing self-interaction between Bose-Einstein constituents.
More generally, the range is given by $\ell^{-1}\propto \sqrt{\lambda n/m}$,
with $\lambda$ being the 2-body self-interaction coupling constant, $n$ the
particle number density in the condensate, and $m$ the mass of the condensed
particles. Naively this may sound surprising since in $\lambda\rightarrow 0$
limit gapless excitations of the condensate have dispersion relation
$\omega_k=k^2/2m$, yet for the mediated force we have $F\propto 1/r^2$. The
reason behind this seemingly counterintuitive result lies in the fact that the
force is being mediated by the phonon, which happens to acquire a nontrivial
derivative interaction with the source. We discuss the potential ramifications

general approach to systematically remove biases, such as position bias, from
learning-to-rank models. The method takes two steps - estimating click
propensities and using them to train unbiased models. Most common methods
proposed in the literature for estimating propensities involve some degree of
intervention in the live search engine. An alternative approach proposed
recently uses an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate
propensities by using ranking features for estimating relevances. In this work
we propose a novel method to directly estimate propensities which does not use
any intervention in live search or rely on modeling relevance. Rather, we take
advantage of the fact that the same query-document pair may naturally change
ranks over time. This typically occurs for eCommerce search because of change
of popularity of items over time, existence of time dependent ranking features,
or addition or removal of items to the index (an item getting sold or a new
item being listed). However, our method is general and can be applied to any
search engine for which the rank of the same document may naturally change over
time for the same query. We derive a simple likelihood function that depends on
propensities only, and by maximizing the likelihood we are able to get
estimates of the propensities. We apply this method to eBay search data to
estimate click propensities for web and mobile search and compare these with
estimates using the EM method. We also use simulated data to show that the
method gives reliable estimates of the ""true"" simulated propensities. Finally,
we train an unbiased learning-to-rank model for eBay search using the estimated
propensities and show that it outperforms both baselines - one without position
bias correction and one with position bias correction using the EM method.

However, many neuron models are stochastic, mimicking fluctuations in the input
from unknown parts of the brain or the spiking nature of signals. Noise changes
the dynamics with respect to the deterministic model; in particular bifurcation
theory cannot be applied. We formulate stochastic neuronal dynamics in the
Martin-Siggia-Rose de Dominicis-Janssen (MSRDJ) formalism and present the
fluctuation expansion of the effective action and the functional
renormalization group (fRG) as two systematic ways to incorporate corrections
to the mean dynamics and time-dependent statistics due to fluctuations in the
presence of nonlinear neuronal gain. To formulate self-consistency equations,
we derive a fundamental link between the effective action in the
Onsager-Machlup(OM) formalism, which allows the study of phase transitions, and
the MSRDJ effective action, which is computationally advantageous. These
results in particular allow the derivation of an OM effective action for
systems with non-Gaussian noise. This approach naturally leads to effective
deterministic equations for the first moment of the stochastic system; they
explain how nonlinearities and noise cooperate to produce memory effects.
Moreover, the MSRDJ formulation yields an effective linear system that has
identical power spectra and linear response. Starting from the better known
loopwise approximation, we then discuss the use of the fRG as a method to
obtain self-consistency beyond the mean. We present a new efficient truncation
scheme for the hierarchy of flow equations for the vertex functions by adapting
the Blaizot, M\'endez and Wschebor approximation from the derivative expansion
to the vertex expansion. The methods are presented by means of the simplest
possible example of a stochastic differential equation that has generic
features of neuronal dynamics.

relation has presented an interesting class of material bodies, for which
strains remain bounded (even infinitesimal) while stresses can become
arbitrarily large. The nonlinearity and material heterogeneities can create
multiscale features in the solution, and multiscale methods are therefore
necessary. To handle the resulting nonlinear monotone quasilinear elliptic
equation, we use linearization based on the Picard iteration. We consider two
types of basis functions, offline and online basis functions, following the
general framework of GMsFEM. The offline basis functions depend nonlinearly on
the solution. Thus, we design an indicator function and we will recompute the
offline basis functions when the indicator function predicts that the material
property has significant change during the iterations. On the other hand, we
will use the residual based online basis functions to reduce the error
substantially when updating basis functions is necessary. Our numerical results
show that the above combination of offline and online basis functions is able

minicircles and to measure DNA bendability. The cyclization probability of
short DNA (< 150 bp) has a strong length dependence, but how it depends on the
rotational positioning of the sticky ends around the helical axis is less
clear. To shed light upon the determinants of the cyclization probability of
short DNA, we measured cyclization and decyclization rates of ~100-bp DNA with
sticky ends over two helical periods using single-molecule Fluorescence
Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). The cyclization rate increases monotonically
with length, indicating no excess twisting, while the decyclization rate
oscillates with length, higher at half-integer helical turns and lower at
integer helical turns. The oscillation profile is kinetically and
thermodynamically consistent with a three-state cyclization model in which
sticky-ended short DNA first bends into a torsionally-relaxed teardrop, and
subsequently transitions to a more stable loop upon terminal base stacking. We
also show that the looping probability density (the J factor) extracted from
this study is in good agreement with the worm-like chain model near 100 bp. For
shorter DNA, we discuss various experimental factors that prevent an accurate
measurement of the J factor.

remain planar imposes compatibility. Compatibility for structures with
prescribed lengths and its linearization is considered. For triangulated
structures, compatibility is expressed as a polynomial equation in the lengths
of edges of the star domain surrounding each interior node. The continuum

compatibility equations may be summed along a closed curve to give conditions
analogous to Gauss-Bonnet integral formula. There are rigid trusses without
compatibility conditions in contrast to continuous materials. The compatibility

with respect to heavy tails, we focus on sign-based statistical procedures,
that is, on procedures that involve the observations only through their
direction from the center of the distribution. We actually consider the generic
problem of testing the null hypothesis that the first principal direction
coincides with a given direction of $\mathbb{R}^p$. We first focus on weak
identifiability setups involving single spikes (that is, involving spectra for
which the smallest eigenvalue has multiplicity $p-1$). We show that,
irrespective of the degree of weak identifiability, such setups offer local
alternatives for which the corresponding sequence of statistical experiments
converges in the Le Cam sense. Interestingly, the limiting experiments depend
on the degree of weak identifiability. We exploit this convergence result to
build optimal sign tests for the problem considered. In classical asymptotic
scenarios where the spectrum is fixed, these tests are shown to be
asymptotically equivalent to the sign-based likelihood ratio tests available in
the literature. Unlike the latter, however, the proposed sign tests are robust
to arbitrarily weak identifiability. We show that our tests meet the asymptotic
level constraint irrespective of the structure of the spectrum, hence also in
possibly multi-spike setups. We fully characterize the non-null asymptotic
distributions of the corresponding test statistics under weak identifiability,

parameters with broad relevance for consumer electronics, surveillance systems,
remote sensing, or medical imaging. However, resolution is physically limited
by the optics and sensor characteristics. In addition, practical and economic
reasons often stipulate the use of out-dated or low-cost hardware.
Super-resolution is a class of retrospective techniques that aims at
high-resolution imagery by means of software. Multi-frame algorithms approach
this task by fusing multiple low-resolution frames to reconstruct
high-resolution images. This work covers novel super-resolution methods along
with new applications in medical imaging.

Dragan","Human-AI Learning Performance in Multi-Armed Bandits","Artificial Intelligence, Ethics and Society (AIES) 2019",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  People frequently face challenging decision-making problems in which outcomes
are uncertain or unknown. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms exist that
can outperform humans at learning such tasks. Thus, there is an opportunity for
AI agents to assist people in learning these tasks more effectively. In this
work, we use a multi-armed bandit as a controlled setting in which to explore
this direction. We pair humans with a selection of agents and observe how well
each human-agent team performs. We find that team performance can beat both
human and agent performance in isolation. Interestingly, we also find that an
agent's performance in isolation does not necessarily correlate with the
human-agent team's performance. A drop in agent performance can lead to a
disproportionately large drop in team performance, or in some settings can even
improve team performance. Pairing a human with an agent that performs slightly
better than them can make them perform much better, while pairing them with an
agent that performs the same can make them them perform much worse. Further,
our results suggest that people have different exploration strategies and might
perform better with agents that match their strategy. Overall, optimizing
human-agent team performance requires going beyond optimizing agent
performance, to understanding how the agent's suggestions will influence human
decision-making.

normalized Euclidean distance of attitude error is trapped to initially start
within a large set and converge systematically and asymptotically to the origin
from almost any initial condition. The convergence rate is guaranteed to be
less than the prescribed value and the steady-state error does not exceed a

a rate gyroscope measurement and two or more vectorial measurements. These
filters provide good attitude estimates with superior convergence properties

the proposed attitude filters with guaranteed performance considering high

dimensional systems in non-vanishing magnetic fields which possess so-called
non-subgroup type integrals. The presence of such integrals means that the
system possesses a pair of integrals of motion in involution which are (at
most) quadratic in momenta and whose leading order terms, that are necessarily
elements of the enveloping algebra of the Euclidean algebra, are not quadratic
Casimir operators of a chain of its subalgebras. By imposing in addition that
one of the integrals has the leading order term $L_z^2$ we can consider three
such commuting pairs: circular parabolic, oblate spheroidal and prolate
spheroidal. We find all possible integrable systems possessing such structure
of commuting integrals and describe their Hamiltonians and their integrals.
  We show that our assumptions imply the existence of a first order integral
$L_z $, i.e. rotational invariance, of all such systems. As a consequence, the
Hamilton--Jacobi equation of each of these systems with magnetic field
separates in the corresponding coordinate system, as it is known to be the case
for all quadratically integrable systems without magnetic field, and in
contrast with the subgroup type, i.e. Cartesian, spherical and cylindrical,
cases, with magnetic fields.
  We also look for superintegrable systems within the circular parabolic
integrable class. Assuming the additional integral to be first order we
demonstrate that only previously known systems exist. However, for a particular
second order ansatz for the sought integral ($L^2+\ldots$) we find a minimally
quadratically superintegrable system. It is not quadratically maximally
superintegrable but appears to possess bounded closed trajectories, hinting at
hypothetical higher order superintegrability.

automatically detect malware through their dynamic behaviors. These approaches
have achieved significant improvement in detection rates and lower false
positive rates at large scale compared with traditional malware analysis
methods. ML in threat detection has demonstrated to be a good cop to guard
platform security. However it is imperative to evaluate - is ML-powered
security resilient enough?
  In this paper, we juxtapose the resiliency and trustworthiness of ML
algorithms for security, via a case study of evaluating the resiliency of
ransomware detection via the generative adversarial network (GAN). In this case
study, we propose to use GAN to automatically produce dynamic features that
exhibit generalized malicious behaviors that can reduce the efficacy of
black-box ransomware classifiers. We examine the quality of the GAN-generated
samples by comparing the statistical similarity of these samples to real
ransomware and benign software. Further we investigate the latent subspace
where the GAN-generated samples lie and explore reasons why such samples cause
a certain class of ransomware classifiers to degrade in performance. Our focus
is to emphasize necessary defense improvement in ML-based approaches for
ransomware detection before deployment in the wild. Our results and discoveries
should pose relevant questions for defenders such as how ML models can be made
more resilient for robust enforcement of security objectives.

turbulence and transport phenomena. In order to design surfaces for these
applications, it is desirable to characterise non-smooth and porous materials
by their ability to exchange mass and momentum with flowing fluids. While the
underlying physics of the tangential (slip) velocity at a fluid-solid interface
is well understood, the importance and treatment of normal (transpiration)
velocity and normal stress is unclear. We show that, when slip velocity varies
at an interface above the texture, a non-zero transpiration velocity arises
from mass conservation. The ability of a given surface texture to accommodate
for a normal velocity of this kind is quantified by a transpiration length. We
further demonstrate that normal momentum transfer gives rise to a pressure
jump. For a porous material, the pressure jump can be characterised by so
called resistance coefficients. By solving five Stokes problems, the introduced
measures of slip, transpiration and resistance can be determined for any
anisotropic non-smooth surface consisting of regularly repeating geometric
patterns. The proposed conditions are a subset of effective boundary conditions
derived from formal multi-scale expansion. We validate and demonstrate the
physical significance of the effective conditions on two canonical problems --
a lid-driven cavity and a turbulent channel flow, both with non-smooth bottom
surfaces.

recombination, radiation, and momentum exchange in detachment. Neither momentum
or power losses by themselves are found to be sufficient to produce a reduction
in target ion flux in detachment (flux rollover); radiative power losses are
required to a) limit and reduce the ionization source and b) access low-target
temperature, T_target, conditions for volumetric momentum losses. Recombination
is found to play little role at flux rollover, but as T_target drops to
temperatures around 1eV, it becomes a strong ion sink. In the case where
radiative losses are dominated by hydrogen, the detachment threshold is
identified as a minimum gradient of the energy cost per ionisation with respect
to T_target. This is also linked to thresholds in T_target and in the ratio of
upstream pressure to power flux.
  A system of determining the detached condition is developed such that the
divertor solution at a given T_target (or lack of one) is determined by the
simultaneous solution of two equations for target ion current - one dependent
on power losses and the other on momentum. Depending on the detailed momentum
and power loss dependence on temperature there are regions of T_target where
there is no solution and the plasma 'jumps' from high to low T_target states.
The novel analysis methods developed here provide an intuitive way to
understand complex detachment phenomena, and can potentially be used to predict
how changes in the seeding impurity used or recycling aspects of the divertor
can be utilised to modify the development of detachment.

elements, hydrogen or helium. Because of their surface high gravitational
field, heavy elements diffuse downwards in a very short timescale compared to
the evolutionary timescale, leaving the lightest ones on the top of the
envelope. This results in the main classification of white dwarfs as hydrogen
rich or helium rich. But many helium rich white dwarfs show also the presence
of hydrogen traces in their atmosphere, whose origin is still unsettled. Here
we study, by means of full evolutionary calculations, the case for a
representative model of the ""He-H-Z"" white dwarfs, a sub-group of helium rich

all of these data, and utilizing Gaia DR2, we find that the planet has a radius

limitations. Namely, dealers face the problem of the illiquidity of instruments
used for hedging it, hence forced to warehouse credit risk. As a result,
dealers tend to offer a limited OTC derivatives market to highly risky
counterparties. Consequently, those highly risky entities rarely have access to
hedging services precisely when they need them most. In this paper we propose a
method to overcome this limitation. We propose to extend the CVA risk-neutral
framework to compute an initial margin (IM) specific to each counterparty,
which depends on the credit quality of the entity at stake, transforming the
effective credit rating of a given netting set to AAA, regardless of the credit
rating of the counterparty. By transforming CVA requirement into IM ones, as
proposed in this paper, an institution could rely on the existing mechanisms
for posting and calling of IM, hence ensuring the operational viability of this
new form of managing warehoused risk. The main difference with the currently
standard framework is the creation of a Specific Initial Margin, that depends
in the credit rating of the counterparty and the characteristics of the netting
set in question. In this paper we propose a methodology for such transformation
in a sound manner, and hence this method overcomes some of the limitations of
the CVA framework.

generalizability since the results are: non-comparable to other password
systems (e.g. PINs), harder to reproduce, and attacker-dependent. Strong
statements about the security of a password system use an analysis of the
statistical distribution of the password space, which models a best-case
attacker who guesses passwords in order of most likely to least likely.
  Estimating the distribution of recognition passwords is challenging because
many different trials need to map to one password. In this paper, we solve this
difficult problem by: (1) representing a recognition password of continuous
data as a discrete alphabet set, and (2) estimating the password distribution
through modeling the unseen passwords. We use Symbolic Aggregate approXimation
(SAX) to represent time series data as symbols and develop Markov chains to
model recognition passwords. We use a partial guessing metric, which
demonstrates how many guesses an attacker needs to crack a percentage of the

Experimental active matter systems of biological or synthetic molecules are

In contrast, CNNs can correctly recognize AN images but mistakenly classify AI

functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain activity evoked by
regular and adversarial images in the human brain, and compare it to the
activity of artificial neurons in a prototypical CNN-AlexNet. In the human
brain, we find that the representational similarity between regular and
adversarial images largely echoes their perceptual similarity in all early
visual areas. In AlexNet, however, the neural representations of adversarial
images are inconsistent with network outputs in all intermediate processing
layers, providing no neural foundations for perceptual similarity. Furthermore,
we show that voxel-encoding models trained on regular images can successfully
generalize to the neural responses to AI images but not AN images. These
remarkable differences between the human brain and AlexNet in the

  fluids","23 pages, 24 figures",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose an efficient threshold dynamics method for topology optimization
for fluids modeled with the Stokes equation. The proposed algorithm is based on
minimization of an objective energy function that consists of the dissipation
power in the fluid and the perimeter approximated by nonlocal energy, subject
to a fluid volume constraint and the incompressibility condition. We show that
the minimization problem can be solved with an iterative scheme in which the
Stokes equation is approximated by a Brinkman equation. The indicator functions
of the fluid-solid regions are then updated according to simple convolutions
followed by a thresholding step. We demonstrate mathematically that the
iterative algorithm has the total energy decaying property. The proposed
algorithm is simple and easy to implement. A simple adaptive time strategy is
also used to accelerate the convergence of the iteration. Extensive numerical
experiments in both two and three dimensions show that the proposed iteration
algorithm converges in much fewer iterations and is more efficient than many
existing methods. In addition, the numerical results show that the algorithm is
very robust and insensitive to the initial guess and the parameters in the
model.

hydraulic conductivity in highly-heterogeneous media often results in a
high-dimensional inverse problem. In this study, a deep autoregressive neural
network-based surrogate method is developed for the forward model to allow us
to solve efficiently such high-dimensional inverse problems. The surrogate is
trained using limited evaluations of the forward model. Since the relationship
between the time-varying inputs and outputs of the forward transport model is
complex, we propose an autoregressive strategy, which treats the output at the
previous time step as input to the network for predicting the output at the
current time step. We employ a dense convolutional encoder-decoder network
architecture in which the high-dimensional input and output fields of the model
are treated as images to leverage the robust capability of convolutional
networks in image-like data processing. An iterative local updating ensemble
smoother (ILUES) algorithm is used as the inversion framework. The proposed
method is evaluated using a synthetic contaminant source identification problem
with 686 uncertain input parameters. Results indicate that, with relatively
limited training data, the deep autoregressive neural network consisting of 27
convolutional layers is capable of providing an accurate approximation for the
high-dimensional model input-output relationship. The autoregressive strategy
substantially improves the network's accuracy and computational efficiency. The
application of the surrogate-based ILUES in solving the inverse problem shows
that it can achieve accurate inversion results and predictive uncertainty

describes an objectively indefinite reality at the quantum level. In
particular, the mathematics of wave propagation is shown to also be the math of
the evolution of indefinite states that do not change the degree of
indistinctness between states. This corrects the historical wrong turn of
seeing QM as ""wave mechanics"" rather than the mechanics of particles with
indefinite/definite properties. For example, the so-called ""wave-particle

directed graphs (i.e., tournaments) is explored. We optimize $H_{\alpha}$ when
$\alpha = 2$ and $3$, and find that as $\alpha$ increases $H_{\alpha}$'s
sensitivity to what we refer to as `regularity' increases as well. A regular
tournament on $n$ vertices is one with each vertex having out-degree
$\frac{n-1}{2}$, but there is a lot of diversity in terms of structure among
the regular tournaments; for example, a regular tournament may be such that
each vertex's out-set induces a regular tournament (a doubly-regular
tournament) or a transitive tournament (a rotational tournament). As $\alpha$
increases, on the set of regular tournaments, $H_{\alpha}$ has maximum value on
doubly regular tournaments and minimum value on rotational tournaments. The
more `regular', the higher the entropy. We show, however, that $H_2$ and $H_3$

tournament. We also provide a calculation that is equivalent to the von Neumann
entropy, but may be applied to any directed or undirected graph and shows that
the von Neumann entropy is a measure of how quickly a random walk on the graph

prove that if the communication topology of the Energy Internet contains a

an important separation principle: The optimal scheduling strategy and the
optimal sampling strategy are independent of each other. In particular, we
prove that, for any given sampling strategy, the Maximum Age First (MAF)
scheduling strategy provides the best age performance among all scheduling
strategies. This transforms our overall optimization problem into an optimal
sampling problem, given that the decision policy follows the MAF scheduling

it does not always minimize the TaA. We use Dynamic Programming (DP) to
investigate the optimal sampling problem for minimizing the TaA. Finally, we

masses of the 260 ETGs from the ATLAS3D survey, using fits to their spectral
energy distributions primarily constructed from AKARI measurements. We also
used literature measurements of the cold (CO and HI) and X-ray gas phases. Our
ETGs show no correlation between their dust and stellar masses, suggesting
inefficient dust production by stars and/or dust destruction in X-ray gas. The
global dust-to-gas mass ratios of ETGs are generally lower than those of
late-type galaxies, likely due to dust-poor HI envelopes in ETGs. They are also
higher in Virgo Cluster ETGs than in group and field ETGs, but the same ratios
measured in the central parts of the galaxies only are independent of galaxy
environment. Slow-rotating ETGs have systematically lower dust masses than
fast-rotating ETGs. The dust masses and X-ray luminosities are correlated in
fast-rotating ETGs, whose star formation rates are also correlated with the
X-ray luminosities. The correlation between dust and X-rays in fast-rotating
ETGs appears to be caused by residual star formation, while slow-rotating ETGs
are likely well evolved, and thus exhausting their dust. These results appear
consistent with the postulated evolution of ETGs, whereby fast-rotating ETGs
form by mergers of late-type galaxies and associated bulge growth, while
slow-rotating ETGs form by (dry) mergers of fast-rotating ETGs. Central cold
dense gas appears to be resilient against ram pressure stripping, suggesting
that Virgo Cluster ETGs may not suffer strong related star formation
suppression.

main sublingual veins gives information of the blood circulation. Therefore, it
is necessary to segment the main sublingual veins from the tongue
automatically. In general, the dataset in the medical field is small, which is
a challenge for training the deep learning model. In order to train the model
with a small data set, the proposed method for automatically segmenting the
sublingual veins is to re-train U-net model with different sets of the limited
number of labels for the same training images. With pre-knowledge of the
segmentation, the loss of the trained model will be convergence easier. To
improve the performance of the segmentation further, a novel strategy of data
augmentation was utilized. The operation for masking output of the model with
the input was randomly switched on or switched off in each training step. This
approach will force the model to learn the contrast invariance and avoid
overfitting. Images of dataset were taken with the developed device using eight
near infrared LEDs. The final segmentation results were evaluated on the
validation dataset by the IoU metric.

here an arbitrary relationship between the widths of soliton and external

purchase in online shops and social networking service information.
Bi-clustering such relational count data reveals the latent structure of the
relationship between objects such as household items or people. When relational
count data observed at multiple time points are available, it is worthwhile
incorporating the time structure into the bi-clustering result to understand
how objects move between the cluster over time. In this paper, we propose two
bi-clustering methods for analyzing time-varying relational count data. The
first model, the dynamic Poisson infinite relational model (dPIRM), handles
time-varying relational count data. In the second model, which we call the
dynamic zero-inflated Poisson infinite relational model, we further extend the
dPIRM so that it can handle zero-inflated data. Proposing both two models is
important as zero-inflated data are often encountered, especially when the time
intervals are short. In addition, by explicitly deriving the relevant full
conditional distributions, we describe the features of the estimated parameters
and, in turn, the relationship between the two models. We show the
effectiveness of both models through a simulation study and a real data
example.

with similar approaches, we do not extract the embedding of an utterance from
the mean reduction of the temporal dimension. Our system replaces the mean by a
phrase alignment model to keep the temporal structure of each phrase which is
relevant in this application since the phonetic information is part of the
identity in the verification task. Moreover, we can apply a convolutional
neural network as front-end, and thanks to the alignment process being
differentiable, we can train the whole network to produce a supervector for
each utterance which will be discriminative with respect to the speaker and the
phrase simultaneously. As we show, this choice has the advantage that the
supervector encodes the phrase and speaker information providing good
performance in text-dependent speaker verification tasks. In this work, the
process of verification is performed using a basic similarity metric, due to
simplicity, compared to other more elaborate models that are commonly used. The
new model using alignment to produce supervectors was tested on the

competitive results compared to similar size networks using the mean to extract

with $f_{0.5-2.0 \,{\rm keV}} > 2.4 \times 10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$,
drawn from the ROSAT Bright Survey catalog. Cross-matching the sample with
infrared data taken from Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, we investigate
the relation between the rest-frame 6 $\mu$m luminosity ($L_{\rm 6}$) and the
rest-frame 2--10 keV luminosity ($L_{\rm X}$), where $L_{\rm 6}$ is corrected
for the contamination of host galaxies by using the spectral energy
distribution fitting technique. We confirm that $L_{\rm 6}$ and $L_{\rm X}$ are
correlated over four orders of magnitude, in the range of $L_{\rm X} =
10^{42-46}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We investigate what kinds of physical parameters
regulate this correlation. We find that $L_{\rm X}$/$L_{\rm 6}$ clearly depends
on the Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$) as $\log \lambda_{\rm Edd} =
-(0.56 \pm 0.10) \log \, (L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm 6}) - (1.07 \pm 0.05)$, even taking
into account quasars that are undetected by ROSAT as well as those detected by
XMM-Newton in the literature. We also add hyper-luminous quasars with $L_{\rm
6}$ $>$ 10$^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the literature and perform a correlation
analysis. The resultant correlation coefficient is $-0.41 \pm 0.07$, indicating
a moderately tight correlation between $L_{\rm X}$/$L_{\rm 6}$ and
$\lambda_{\rm Edd}$. This means that AGNs with high Eddington ratios tend to
have lower X-ray luminosities with respect to the mid-infrared luminosities.
This dependence can be interpreted as a change in the structure of the
accretion flow.

We focus on two areas where, as we have found, employing RP techniques can
improve deep models: training neural networks on high-dimensional data and
initialization of network parameters. Training deep neural networks (DNNs) on
sparse, high-dimensional data with no exploitable structure implies a network
architecture with an input layer that has a huge number of weights, which often
makes training infeasible. We show that this problem can be solved by
prepending the network with an input layer whose weights are initialized with
an RP matrix. We propose several modifications to the network architecture and
training regime that makes it possible to efficiently train DNNs with learnable
RP layer on data with as many as tens of millions of input features and
training examples. In comparison to the state-of-the-art methods, neural
networks with RP layer achieve competitive performance or improve the results

where the application of RP techniques can be beneficial for training deep

room temperature is one of the cornerstones of modern nanophotonics. Achieving
this goal will enable new platforms for potential applications such as quantum
information processing, quantum light sources and even quantum metrology.
Materials like transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) and in particular
tungsten disulfide (WS$_2$) possess large transition dipole moments comparable
to semiconductor-based quantum dots, and strong exciton binding energies
allowing the detailed exploration of light-matter interactions at room
temperature. Additionally, recent works have shown that coupling TMDCs to
plasmonic nanocavities with light tightly focused on the nanometer scale can
reach the strong-coupling regime at ambient conditions. Here, we use ultra-thin
single-crystalline gold nanodisks featuring large in-plane electromagnetic
dipole moments aligned with the exciton transition-dipole moments located in
monolayer WS$_2$. Through scattering and reflection spectroscopy we demonstrate
strong coupling at room temperature with a Rabi splitting of $\sim$108 meV. In
order to go further into the strong-coupling regime and inspired by recent
experimental work by St\""uhrenberg et al., we couple these nanodisks to
multilayer WS$_2$. Due to an increase in the number of excitons coupled to our
nanodisks, we achieve a Rabi splitting of $\sim$175 meV, a major increase of
62%. To our knowledge, this is the highest Rabi splitting reported for TMDCs
coupled to open plasmonic cavities. Our results suggest that ultra-thin
single-crystalline gold nanodisks coupled to WS$_2$ represent an exquisite
platform to explore light-matter interactions.

restored lossless. In this paper, A high-capacity RDHEI algorithm is proposed.
At first, the Most Significant Bits (MSB) of each pixel was predicted

space. Since all codes tend to follow the same prior, it often suffers the
so-called ""posterior collapse"". To avoid this, this paper introduces the class
specific distribution for the latent code. But different from CVAE, we present
a method for disentangling the latent space into the label relevant and
irrelevant dimensions, $\bm{\mathrm{z}}_s$ and $\bm{\mathrm{z}}_u$, for a
single input. We apply two separated encoders to map the input into
$\bm{\mathrm{z}}_s$ and $\bm{\mathrm{z}}_u$ respectively, and then give the
concatenated code to the decoder to reconstruct the input. The label irrelevant
code $\bm{\mathrm{z}}_u$ represent the common characteristics of all inputs,
hence they are constrained by the standard Gaussian, and their encoder is
trained in amortized variational inference way, like VAE. While
$\bm{\mathrm{z}}_s$ is assumed to follow the Gaussian mixture distribution in
which each component corresponds to a particular class. The parameters for the
Gaussian components in $\bm{\mathrm{z}}_s$ encoder are optimized by the label
supervision in a global stochastic way. In theory, we show that our method is
actually equivalent to adding a KL divergence term on the joint distribution of
$\bm{\mathrm{z}}_s$ and the class label $c$, and it can directly increase the
mutual information between $\bm{\mathrm{z}}_s$ and the label $c$. Our model can
also be extended to GAN by adding a discriminator in the pixel domain so that
it produces high quality and diverse images.

systems are sufficient in nature, and consequently, their violation does not
conclude instability of a switched system. The study of instability is,
however, important for obvious reasons. Our contributions are twofold: Firstly,
we propose a class of switching signals under which a continuous-time switched
linear system is unstable. Our characterization of instability depends solely
on the asymptotic behaviour of frequency of switching, frequency of transition
between subsystems, and fraction of activation of subsystems. Secondly, we show
that our class of destabilizing switching signals is a strict subset of the
class of switching signals that does not satisfy asymptotic characterization of
stability recently proposed in the literature. This observation identifies a
gap between asymptotic characterizations of stabilizing and destabilizing
switching signals for switched linear systems. The main apparatus for our
analysis is multiple Lyapunov-like functions.

carefully characterize the viscoelastic properties of two families of dilute

velocimetry method to measure with a high accuracy the dynamics of particles
focusing in flow for Weissenberg numbers Wi ranging from $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-1}$

employs a two-stage method where the first stage finds the most certain sources

parameter maps) are called inessential.
  For a directed space, one may consider various categories whose objects are

linear time preprocessing (in the input tree), we can enumerate answers with
linear delay (in each answer). We allow updates on the tree to take place at

  Our result follows our previous circuit-based enumeration algorithms based on

recent tree balancing scheme by Niewerth, so that our enumeration structure
supports updates to the underlying tree in logarithmic time (with leaf
insertions, leaf deletions, and node relabelings). Our result implies that, for
MSO queries with free first-order variables, we can enumerate the results with
linear preprocessing and constant-delay and update the underlying tree in
logarithmic time, which improves on several known results for words and trees.
  Building on lower bounds from data structure research, we also show
unconditionally that up to a doubly logarithmic factor the update time of our

  This need is particularly apparent in the realm of Hierarchical Reinforcement

action or state structures, modern RL algorithms still exhibit great difficulty
in solving domains that necessitate hierarchical modeling and action planning,
even when such domains are seemingly trivial. These difficulties highlight both
the need for more focus on HRL algorithms themselves, and the need for new
testbeds that will encourage and validate HRL research.
  Existing HRL testbeds exhibit a Goldilocks problem; they are often either too
simple (e.g. Taxi) or too complex (e.g. Montezuma's Revenge from the Arcade

new flexible, scalable, and fully implemented testing domain for HRL that
bridges the ""moderate complexity"" gap left behind by existing alternatives. ERD
is open-source and freely available through GitHub, and conforms to widely-used

little work on the confined systems, especially on general curved surfaces. In
this work, we developed a linear surface finite element method, which has a
rigorous mathematical theory to guarantee numerical precsion, to study the

several distinct curved surfaces, including five closed surfaces and an

new width is sandwiched between the submodular and the fractional hypertree

proportional to #subw and respectively to the relaxed version of #subw.

how to choose proper neighbors for graph construction and explore the spatial
information of HSI data. In this paper, we proposed an unsupervised
dimensionality reduction algorithm termed spatial-spectral manifold
reconstruction preserving embedding (SSMRPE) for HSI classification. At first,
a weighted mean filter (WMF) is employed to preprocess the image, which aims to
reduce the influence of background noise. According to the spatial consistency
property of HSI, the SSMRPE method utilizes a new spatial-spectral combined
distance (SSCD) to fuse the spatial structure and spectral information for
selecting effective spatial-spectral neighbors of HSI pixels. Then, it explores
the spatial relationship between each point and its neighbors to adjusts the
reconstruction weights for improving the efficiency of manifold reconstruction.
As a result, the proposed method can extract the discriminant features and
subsequently improve the classification performance of HSI. The experimental
results on PaviaU and Salinas hyperspectral datasets indicate that SSMRPE can
achieve better classification accuracies in comparison with some
state-of-the-art methods.

Entangled photons have become a standard tool in quantum information and

pairs, explained heuristically through the correlations implied by a common
birth zone and momentum conservation. However, these arguments entirely neglect
the importance of the `quantumness', i.e. coherence, of the driving force
behind the generation mechanism. We study theoretically and experimentally how
the correlations depend on the coherence of the pump of nonlinear
down-conversion. In the extreme case - a truly incoherent pump - only position
correlations exist. By increasing the pump's coherence, correlations in momenta
emerge until their strength is sufficient to produce entanglement. Our results

mRNA translation and turnover in eukaryotes. miRNAs, in particular, interact
with their target RNAs through protein-mediated, sequence-specific binding,
giving rise to extended and highly heterogeneous miRNA-RNA interaction
networks. Within such networks, competition to bind miRNAs can generate an
effective positive coupling between their targets. Competing endogenous RNAs
(ceRNAs) can in turn regulate each other through miRNA-mediated crosstalk.
Albeit potentially weak, ceRNA interactions can occur both dynamically,
affecting e.g. the regulatory clock, and at stationarity, in which case ceRNA
networks as a whole can be implicated in the composition of the cell's
proteome. Many features of ceRNA interactions, including the conditions under
which they become significant, can be unraveled by mathematical and in silico
models. We review the understanding of the ceRNA effect obtained within such
frameworks, focusing on the methods employed to quantify it, its role in the
processing of gene expression noise, and how network topology can determine its
reach.

antiferromagnets driven by a spin-orbit field. For a DW with the width of a few
lattice constants, we identify a Peierls-like pinning effect, with the
depinning field exponentially decaying with the DW width, so that a spin-orbit
field moderately larger than the threshold can drive the propagation of an
atomic DW in a step-wise manner. For a broad DW, the Peierls pinning is
negligibly small. However, the external spin-orbit field can induce a fast DW
propagation, accompanied by a significant shrinking of its width down to atomic
scales. Before stepping into the pinning region, noticeable spin waves are
emitted at the tail of the DW. The spin-wave emission event not only broadens
the effective width of the DW, but also pushes the DW velocity over the
magnonic barrier, which is generally believed to be the relativistic limit of
the DW speed. While the existing dynamic theory based on the continuum
approximation fails in the atomic scale, we develop an energy conversion theory
to interpret the DW dynamics beyond the relativistic limit.

US. Readmission within 30 days after a HF hospitalization is both a recognized
indicator for disease progression and a source of considerable financial burden
to the healthcare system. Consequently, the identification of patients at risk
for readmission is a key step in improving disease management and patient
outcome. In this work, we used a large administrative claims dataset to
(1)explore the systematic application of neural network-based models versus
logistic regression for predicting 30 days all-cause readmission after
discharge from a HF admission, and (2)to examine the additive value of
patients' hospitalization timelines on prediction performance. Based on data
from 272,778 (49% female) patients with a mean (SD) age of 73 years (14) and
343,328 HF admissions (67% of total admissions), we trained and tested our
predictive readmission models following a stratified 5-fold cross-validation
scheme. Among the deep learning approaches, a recurrent neural network (RNN)
combined with conditional random fields (CRF) model (RNNCRF) achieved the best
performance in readmission prediction with 0.642 AUC (95% CI, 0.640-0.645).
Other models, such as those based on RNN, convolutional neural networks and CRF
alone had lower performance, with a non-timeline based model (MLP) performing
worst. A competitive model based on logistic regression with LASSO achieved a
performance of 0.643 AUC (95%CI, 0.640-0.646). We conclude that data from
patient timelines improve 30 day readmission prediction for neural
network-based models, that a logistic regression with LASSO has equal
performance to the best neural network model and that the use of administrative
data result in competitive performance compared to published approaches based
on richer clinical datasets.

each two decades of decrement of power noise on the receiver photodiode. The
best clipping factor is obtained through the analysis of locator accuracy and
transmission capacity for each simulated system. Finally, the numerical results
also demonstrate effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of the proposed

model in hydrodynamics. The long-time behaviour of solutions is largely
unknown; statistical mechanics predicts a steady vorticity configuration, but
detailed numerical results in the literature contradict this theory, yielding
instead persistent unsteadiness. Such numerical results were obtained using
artificial hyperviscosity to account for the cascade of enstrophy into smaller
scales. Hyperviscosity, however, destroys the underlying geometry of the phase
flow (such as conservation of Casimir functions), and therefore might affect
the qualitative long-time behaviour. Here we develop an efficient numerical
method for long-time simulations that preserve the geometric features of the
exact flow, in particular conservation of Casimirs. Long-time simulations on a
non-rotating sphere then reveal three possible outcomes for generic initial
conditions: the formation of either 2, 3, or 4 coherent vortex structures.
These numerical results contradict the statistical mechanics theory and show
that previous numerical results, suggesting 4 coherent vortex structures as the
generic behaviour, display only a special case. Through integrability theory
for point vortex dynamics on the sphere we present a theoretical model which
describes the mechanism by which the three observed regimes appear. We show
that there is a correlation between a first integral $\gamma$ (the ratio of
total angular momentum and the square root of enstrophy) and the long-time
behaviour: $\gamma$ small, intermediate, and large yields most likely 4, 3, or
2 coherent vortex formations. Our findings thus suggest that the likely
long-time behaviour can be predicted from the first integral $\gamma$.

developed flow is studied by means of an experimental investigation carried out
in a straight, smooth-walled duct.The presence of a coherent perturbation, such
as an acoustic wave in a turbulent confined flow, generates the oscillation of
the wall shear stress. In this circumstance a shear wave is excited and
superimposed on the sound wave. The turbulent shear stress is modulated by the
shear wave and the wall shear stress is strongly affected by the turbulence.
From the experimental point of view, it results in a measured damping strictly
connected to the ratio between the thickness of the acoustic sublayer, which is
frequency dependent, and the thickness of the viscous sublayer of the turbulent
mean flow, the last one being dependent on the Mach number. By reducing the
turbulence, the viscous sublayer thickness increases and the wave propagation
is mainly dominated by convective effects. In the present work, the damping and
wall impedance have been extracted from the measured complex wavenumber, which
represents the most important parameter used to characterize the wave
propagation. An experimental approach, referred to as iterative plane wave
decomposition, has been used in order to obtain the results. The investigations
have been carried out at low Mach number turbulent flows, low Helmholtz numbers
and low shear wavenumbers. The aim is to overcome a certain lack of
experimental results found by the authors of the most recent models for the
plane wave propagation in turbulent flows, such as Knutsson et al. (The effect
of turbulence damping on acoustic wave propagation in tubes, Journal of Sound

less energy-consuming sleeping states to save energy. To this end, we first
represent the overall SCN traffic by a new load variable, and analyze its

algorithms exploiting this load variable in centralized and distributed
fashions. We show that proposed load based OOS algorithms can lead to as high
as 50\% of energy savings without sacrificing the average SCN throughput. In
addition, load based strategies are shown to work well under high SCN traffic
and delay-intolerant circumstances, and can be implemented efficiently using
the load statistics. We also show that the performance of load based algorithms
gets maximized for certain length of sleeping periods, where assuming short
sleep periods is as energy-inefficient as keeping SBSs in sleep states for very

distribution into composition, structural and selection effects. Composition
effects have increased wages at all quantiles while the impact of the
structural effects varies by time period and quantile. Changes in the role of
selection only appear at the lower quantiles of the wage distribution. The
evidence suggests that there is positive selection in the 1970s which
diminishes until the later 1990s. This reduces wages at lower quantiles and
increases wage inequality. Post 2000 there appears to be an increase in
positive sorting which reduces the selection effects on wage inequality.

experiments are performed. The temperature dependence of heat capacity
(normalized) at glass transition temperature (Tg), exhibits fluctuations for
samples with higher AgI concentration. This specific quality attributes to
fragile glass. The wide range of composition accommodates both the fragile and
strong glasses, and therefore a fragility threshold. The heat capacity
(absolute) values, at Tg when plotted over the whole range of compositions,
exhibits an abrupt sign shift, from negative to positive, revealing the
fragility threshold. The appearance of negative heat capacity has been
corroborated with the thermodynamic behavior of nanoclusters. This technique
has been identified as a novel method to recognize the existence of
nanoclusters in this type of glasses. The photoelectron spectroscopy study
shows the formation of essential covalent structural units, [- Mo - O - Ag - O

the non-reversing enthalpy profile has been studied over the whole composition

metallic and insulating extended systems using the optimal basis method
originally proposed by E. L. Shirley in 1996. Two different approaches for the
evaluation of the complex dielectric function are implemented: (i) the
independent-particle approximation considering both interband and intraband
contributions for metals and (ii) the Bethe-Salpeter equation for insulators.
Since, notably, the optimal basis set is systematically improvable, accurate
results can be obtained at a strongly reduced computational cost. Moreover, the
simplicity of the method allows for a straightforward use of the code;
improvement of the optimal basis and thus the overall precision of the
simulations is simply controlled by one (for metals) or two (for insulators)
input thresholds. The code is extensively tested, in terms of verification and
performance, on bulk silver for metals and on bulk silicon for insulators.

criterion 3 and 4 of the ABET engineering accreditation guidelines, which are
arguably the most important, documentation-intensive and complex requirements
in the entire process. Users can systematically manage large amounts of
assessment data, conveniently run various queries and reports using
pre-specified filters, and use them in analyzing the strengths, weaknesses and
critical areas of the educational program. For closing the assessment cycle
loop, the electronic tool also provides the ability to manage verbal feedback
and observations for planning remedial actions and continually improving the
program. The use of the application is demonstrated through illustrative
examples on data gathered over multiple academic terms. The program and its
user guide are available to educators and evaluators.

as well as objectiveness of hand bone age assessment. These approaches make
predictions according to the whole X-ray images, which include other objects
that may introduce distractions. Instead, our framework is inspired by the
clinical workflow (Tanner-Whitehouse) of hand bone age assessment, which
focuses on the key components of the hand. The proposed framework is composed
of two components: a Mask R-CNN subnet of pixelwise hand segmentation and a
residual attention network for hand bone age assessment. The Mask R-CNN subnet
segments the hands from X-ray images to avoid the distractions of other objects
(e.g., X-ray tags). The hierarchical attention components of the residual
attention subnet force our network to focus on the key components of the X-ray
images and generate the final predictions as well as the associated visual
supports, which is similar to the assessment procedure of clinicians. We
evaluate the performance of the proposed pipeline on the RSNA pediatric bone
age dataset and the results demonstrate its superiority over the previous
methods.

analyze and further propose a modification of the Albritton-
Williams-Bernstein-Swartz collision operator Phys. Rev. Lett 57, 1887 (1986)
for the nonlocal electron transport under conditions relevant to ICF. The
electron distribution function provided by this modification exhibits some very
desirable properties when compared to the full Fokker- Planck operator in the
local diffusive regime, and also performs very well when benchmarked against
Vlasov-Fokker-Planck and collisional PIC codes in the nonlocal transport
regime, where we find that the effect of the electric field via the nonlocal
Ohms law is an essential ingredient in order to capture the electron kinetics
properly.

field to sense the environment and send collected data to a base station for
processing; these sensors depend on non-rechargeable batteries, so the routing
protocols for such network of sensors need to be efficient. LEACH is one of
these protocols which is a hierarchical routing protocol and helps in saving
energy in wireless sensor networks. Enhanced LEACH depends on a mathematical
model to calculate the estimated average energy in each round. consequently,
utilizing the node remaining energy to ensure rotating cluster head role over
all the nodes. It also depends on a mathematical model to calculate base
station distance from work field whereas LEACH does not take into its account
any consideration for remaining energy of node. In this paper, we enhance LEACH
(work efficiency in homogeneous networks) to adapt with base-station distance,
thus more energy saving for certain distances from base-station. The obtained
simulation results show that enhanced LEACH saves energy better than LEACH and
increase network stability and reliability when base-station is inside working
field and consume the same energy as LEACH when base-station is outside work
field.

field-effect transistors (FETs) that enable the detection of pH changes with
~75-fold higher sensitivity (4.4 V/pH) over the Nernst value of 59 mV/pH at
room temperature when used as a biosensor. The transistors, which are
fabricated from a monolayer of MoS2 with a room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL)
in place of a conventional oxide gate dielectric, exhibit very low intrinsic
noise resulting in a pH limit of detection (LOD) of 92x10^-6 at 10 Hz. This
high device performance, which is a function of the structure of our device, is
achieved by remotely connecting the gate to a pH sensing element allowing the
FETs to be reused. Because pH measurements are fundamentally important in
biotechnology, the low limit of detection demonstrated here will benefit
numerous applications ranging from pharmaceutical manufacturing to clinical
diagnostics. As an example, we experimentally quantified the function of the
kinase Cdk5, an enzyme implicated in Alzheimer's disease, at concentrations
that are 5-fold lower than physiological values, and with sufficient
time-resolution to allow the estimation of both steady-state and kinetic
parameters in a single experiment. The high sensitivity, low LOD and fast
turnaround time of the measurements will allow the development of early
diagnostic tools and novel therapeutics to detect and treat neurological
conditions years before currently possible.

into account the bottom and the high-level crossover and mutation, ie., the
boundary of the hierarchical genetic algorithm. Operators and optimal
individuals based on optional annealing are designed. Based on the numerous
versions of genetic algorithm, the boundary evolution approach with crossover
and mutation has been tested on the SAT problem and compared with two competing
methods: a traditional genetic algorithm and another traditional hierarchical
genetic algorithm, and among some others. The results of the comparative
experiments in solving SAT problem have proved that the new hierarchical
genetic algorithm based on simulated annealing and optimal individuals (BEA)
can improve the success rate and convergence speed considerably for SAT problem
due to its avoidance of both divergence and loss of optimal individuals, and by
coronary, conducive to NP problem. Though more extensive comparisons are to be
made on more algorithms, the consideration of the boundary elasticity of
hierarchical genetic algorithm is an implication of evolutionary algorithm.

using the amplitude mode expansion method, which is based on eigenmode
expansion and introduction of losses in form of loss factors. The measurement
reproduced almost all the calculated resonances from the numerical models with
fairly good agreement. The cause of the differences between the measured and
the simulated resonances are explained. In addition, the amplitude mode
expansion simulation model is established as a quicker and computationally less
demanding photoacoustic simulation alternative to the viscothermal model. The
resonance frequencies obtained from the two models deviate by less than 1.8%.
It was noted that the relative height of the amplitudes of the two models
depended on the location of the antinodes within the resonator.
