X-ray binary Cen X-4 in order to constrain the inclination of the system and
mass of the neutron star. Near-IR photometric monitoring was performed in May
2008 over a period of three nights at Magellan using PANIC. We obtain J, H and
K lightcurves of Cen X-4 using differential photometry. An ellipsoidal modeling
code was used to fit the phase folded light curves. The lightcurve fit which
makes the least assumptions about the properties of the binary system yields an
inclination of 34.9 (+4.9, -3.6) degrees, which is consistent with previous
determinations of the system's inclination but with improved statistical
uncertainties. When combined with the mass function and mass ratio, this
inclination yields a neutron star mass of 1.51 (+0.40, -0.55) M_sun. This model
allows accretion disk parameters to be free in the fitting process. Fits that
do not allow for an accretion disk component in the near-IR flux gives a
systematically lower inclination between approximately 33 and 34 degrees,
leading to a higher mass neutron star between approximately 1.7 M_sun and 1.8
M_sun. We discuss the implications of other assumptions made during the
modeling process as well as numerous free parameters and their effects on the
resulting inclination.

via a specific ultrasound vibro-elastography (UVE) technique. This study builds
upon our prior investigation, in which UVE was used to evaluate the
viscoelastic properties of the corpus cavernosa in the flaccid and erect
states. A two-dimensional poroviscoelastic finite element model (FEM) was
developed to simulate wave propagation in the penile tissue according to our
experimental setup. Various levels of EP were applied to the corpus cavernosa,
and the relationship between shear wave speed in the corpus cavernosa and EP
was investigated. Results demonstrated non-linear, positive correlations
between shear wave speeds in the corpus cavernosa and increasing EP at
different vibration frequencies (100-200 Hz). These findings represent the
first report of the impact of EP on shear wave speed and validates the use of
UVE in the evaluation of men with erectile dysfunction. Further evaluations are
warranted to determine the clinical utility of this instrument in the diagnosis
and treatment of men with erectile dysfunction.

The domain is assumed to have a Lipschitz boundary with small Lipschitz

thermalization, the correlations between occupation numbers increase in time
resulting in the emergence of the Bose-Einstein distribution. We show, both
analytically and numerically, that before saturation the two-point correlation
function increases quadratically in time. This time dependence is at variance
with the exponential increase of the number of principal components of the wave
function, recently discovered and explained in Ref.\cite{BIS18}. We also
demonstrate that the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) increases
algebraically in time but not exponentially as predicted in many publications.
Our results, that can be confirmed experimentally in traps with interacting

exploitation of parallelism and, as a high-level language, Prolog is also often
used as a means to explicitly control concurrent tasks. Tabling is a powerful
implementation technique that overcomes some limitations of traditional Prolog
systems in dealing with recursion and redundant sub-computations. Given these
advantages, the question that arises is if tabling has also the potential for
the exploitation of concurrency/parallelism. On one hand, tabling still
exploits a search space as traditional Prolog but, on the other hand, the
concurrent model of tabling is necessarily far more complex since it also
introduces concurrency on the access to the tables. In this paper, we summarize
Yap's main contributions to concurrent tabled evaluation and we describe the
design and implementation challenges of several alternative table space designs
for implicit and explicit concurrent tabled evaluation which represent
different trade-offs between concurrency and memory usage. We also motivate for
the advantages of using fixed-size and lock-free data structures, elaborate on
the key role that the engine's memory allocator plays on such environments, and
discuss how Yap's mode-directed tabling support can be extended to concurrent
evaluation. Finally, we present our future perspectives towards an efficient

families (or households), which are within small areas, from a population-based

individuals with a specific character for each area. To accommodate the binary
data and important features of all sampled individuals, we use a hierarchical
Bayesian logistic regression model with each family (not area) having its own
random effect. This modeling helps to correct for overshrinkage so common in
small area estimation. Because there are numerous families, the computational
time on the joint posterior density using standard Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) methods is prohibitive. Therefore, the joint posterior density of the
hyper-parameters is approximated using an integrated nested normal
approximation (INNA) via the multiplication rule. This approach provides a
sampling-based method that permits fast computation, thereby avoiding very
time-consuming MCMC methods. Then, the random effects are obtained from the
exact conditional posterior density using parallel computing. The unknown
nonsample features and household sizes are obtained using a nested Bayesian
bootstrap that can be done using parallel computing as well. For relatively
small data sets (e.g., 5000 families), we compare our method with a MCMC method
to show that our approach is reasonable. We discuss an example on health
severity using the Nepal Living Standards Survey (NLSS).

atmospheres for a sample of 49 nearby X-ray and optically bright elliptical
galaxies using {\it Chandra} X-ray data. We focus on the connection between the
properties of the hot X-ray emitting gas and the cooler H$\alpha$+[NII]
emitting phase, and the possible role of the latter in the AGN (Active Galactic
Nuclei) feedback cycle. We do not find evident correlations between the
H$\alpha$+[NII] emission and global properties such as X-ray luminosity, mass
of hot gas, and gas mass fraction. We find that the presence of H$\alpha$+[NII]
emission is more likely in systems with higher densities, lower entropies,
shorter cooling times, shallower entropy profiles, lower values of min($t_{\rm
cool}/t_{\rm ff}$), and disturbed X-ray morphologies (linked to turbulent
motions). However, we see no clear separations in the observables obtained for
galaxies with and without optical emission line nebulae. The AGN jet powers of
the galaxies with X-ray cavities show hint of a possible weak positive
correlation with their H$\alpha$+[NII] luminosities. This correlation and the
observed trends in the thermodynamic properties may result from chaotic cold
accretion (CCA) powering AGN jets, as seen in some high-resolution hydrodynamic
simulations.

three-manifold with string-like defects into the space of flat connections on a
so-called 2d Heegaard surface, we propose a novel way to define gauge invariant
bases for (3+1)d lattice gauge theories and gauge models of topological phases.
In particular, this method reconstructs the spin network basis and yields a
novel dual spin network basis. While the spin network basis allows to interpret
states in terms of electric excitations, on top of a vacuum sharply peaked on a
vanishing electric field, the dual spin network basis describes magnetic (or
curvature) excitations, on top of a vacuum sharply peaked on a vanishing
magnetic field (or flat connection). This technique is also applicable for
manifolds with boundaries. We distinguish in particular a dual pair of boundary
conditions, namely of electric type and of magnetic type. This can be used to
consider a generalization of Ocneanu's tube algebra in order to reveal the
algebraic structure of the excitations associated with certain 3d manifolds.

a general VQE protocol because the calculation will invariably collapse to a

avoided by introducing necessary constraints directing VQE to the electronic

targets with high sky density motivates a desire for simultaneous speckle
imaging over large FOVs, however it is currently impractical to attain this by
covering the entire focal plane with fast readout detectors. An alternative
approach is to connect a relatively small number of detector pixels to multiple
interesting targets spanning a large FOV through the use of optical fibers, a
technique employed in spectroscopy for decades. However, for imaging we require
the use of coherent fiber bundles (CFBs). We discuss various design
considerations for coherent fiber speckle imaging with an eye toward a
multiplexed system using numerous configurable CFBs, and we test its viability

we study the problem of secure distributed matrix multiplication from
distributed untrustworthy servers. This problem falls in the category of secure
function computation and has received significant attention in the cryptography
community. However, the fundamental limits of information-theoretically secure
matrix multiplication remain an open problem. We focus on
information-theoretically secure distributed matrix multiplication with the
goal of characterizing the minimum communication overhead. The capacity of
secure matrix multiplication is defined as the maximum possible ratio of the
desired information and the total communication received from $N$ distributed
servers. In particular, we study the following two models where we want to
multiply two matrices $A\in\mathbb{F}^{m\times n}$ and $B\in\mathbb{F}^{n\times
p}$: $(a)$ one-sided secure matrix multiplication with $\ell$ colluding
servers, in which $B$ is a public matrix available at all servers and $A$ is a
private matrix. $(b)$ fully secure matrix multiplication with $\ell$ colluding
servers, in which both $A$ and $B$ are private matrices. The goal is to
securely multiply $A$ and $B$ when any $\ell$ servers can collude. For model
$(a)$, we characterize the capacity as
$C_{\text{one-sided}}^{(\ell)}=(N-\ell)/N$ by providing a secure matrix
multiplication scheme and a matching converse. For model $(b)$, we propose a
novel scheme that lower bounds the capacity, i.e.,
$C_{\text{fully}}^{(\ell)}\geq (\lceil \sqrt{N}-\ell \rceil)^2/(\lceil

Significantly, the current systems include a crucial role for close-in
planetary satellites analogous to the role played by the Galilean satellites
around Jupiter. We present the first radio observations of the seven-planet
TRAPPIST-1 system using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, looking for both
highly circularly polarized radio emission and/or persistent quiescent
emissions. We measure a broadband upper flux density limit of <8.1 $\mu$Jy
across 4-8 GHz, and place these observations both in the context of
expectations for stellar radio emission, and the possible electrodynamic
engines driving strong radio emissions in very-low mass stars and brown dwarfs,
with implications for future radio surveys of TRAPPIST-1 like planet-hosts. We
conclude that magnetic activity of TRAPPIST-1 is predominantly coronal and does
not behave like the strong radio emitters at the stellar/sub-stellar boundary.
We further discuss the potential importance of magnetic field topology and
rotation rates, demonstrating that a TRAPPIST-1 like planetary system around a
rapidly rotating very-low mass star can generate emission consistent with the
observed radio luminosities of very-low mass stars and brown dwarfs.

passive fractions can be obtained only by assuming that cooling can continue on
satellites, at the rate predicted considering halo properties at infall, even
after their parent dark matter substructure is stripped below the resolution of

supernovae explosions and stellar winds with respect to previous versions of

these two clumps have comparable UV, infrared, [OIII], and [CII] luminosities.
Based on these results, we argue that B14-65666 is a starburst galaxy induced

specific star-formation rate (defined as the star-formation rate per unit

contributes to its high dust temperature and the [OIII]-to-[CII] luminosity
ratio.

whose velocity dispersions are damped by drag from circumstellar disc gas.
Accretion cross-sections can approach maximal Hill-sphere scales for particles
whose Stokes numbers approach unity. While fast, pebble accretion is also
lossy. Gas drag brings pebbles to protocores but also sweeps them past; those
particles with the largest accretion cross-sections also have the fastest
radial drift speeds and are the most easily drained out of discs. We present a
global model of planet formation by pebble accretion that keeps track of the
disc's mass budget. Cores, each initialized with a lunar mass, grow from discs
whose finite stores of mm-cm sized pebbles drift inward across all radii in
viscously accreting gas. For every 1 $M_\oplus$ netted by a core, at least 10
$M_\oplus$ and possibly much more are lost to radial drift. Core growth rates
are typically exponentially sensitive to particle Stokes number, turbulent Mach
number, and solid surface density. This exponential sensitivity, when combined
with disc migration, tends to generate binary outcomes from 0.1-30 AU: either
sub-Earth cores remain sub-Earth, or explode into Jupiters, with the latter
migrating inward to varying degrees. When Jupiter-breeding cores assemble from
mm-cm sized pebbles, they do so in discs where such particles drain out in
$\sim$10$^5$ yr or less; such fast-draining discs do not fit mm-wave
observations.

between different interactions so that small uncertainties in microscopic

such a bound for the conventional phonon-mediated mechanism of pairing with
strongly retarded interactions, i.e. in the case in which $\hbar\bar \omega \ll
E_F$ where $\bar \omega$ is an appropriate characteristic phonon frequency and
$E_F$ is the Fermi energy. Specifically, drawing on both empirical results

from the top layers of the convection zone to the corona, are analyzed. Using

formation of organized horizontal magnetic sheets covering whole granules. Our
approach is twofold, calculating statistical properties of the system, like
joint probability density functions (JPDFs), and pursuing individual events via
visualization tools. We conclude that the small magnetic loops surfacing within
individual granules in the observations may originate from sites at or near the
downflows in the granular and mesogranular levels, probably in the first 1 or
1.5 Mm below the surface. We also document the creation of granule-covering
magnetic sheet-like structures through the sideways expansion of a small

the interiors, or dispersing from them. We compute the spatially-resolved mass
accretion/dispersal rate across all clumps, and map the local flow timescale.
While these flows are not clearly correlated with clump structures, the
inferred accretion rate is a statistically strong function of the local mass
surface density $\Sigma$, suggesting near-exponential growth or loss of mass
over effective timescales $\sim$30-50 Myr. At high enough $\Sigma$, accretion
dominates, suggesting gravity plays an important role in both processes. If
confirmed by numerical simulations, this sedimentation picture would support
arguments for long clump lifetimes mediated by pressure confinement, with a

this paper, we study the repair bandwidth and sub-packetization size of RS
codes. The repair bandwidth is defined as the amount of transmitted information
from surviving nodes to a failed node. The RS code can be viewed as a
polynomial over a finite field $GF(q^\ell)$ evaluated at a set of points, where
$\ell$ is called the sub-packetization size. Smaller bandwidth reduces the
network traffic in distributed storage, and smaller $\ell$ facilitates the
implementation of RS codes with lower complexity. Recently, Guruswami and
Wootters proposed a repair method for RS codes when the evaluation points are
the entire finite field. While the sub-packization size can be arbitrarily
small, the repair bandwidth is higher than the minimum storage regenerating
(MSR) bound. Tamo, Ye and Barg achieved the MSR bound but the sub-packetization
size grows faster than the exponential function of the number of the evaluation
points. In this work, we present code constructions and repair schemes that
extend these results to accommodate different sizes of the evaluation points.
In other words, we design schemes that provide points in between. These schemes
provide a flexible tradeoff between the sub-packetization size and the repair
bandwidth. In addition, we generalize our schemes to manage multiple failures.

(TEM) experiments. Here, a windowless system consisting of polymer nanoreactors
deposited via scanning probe block copolymer lithography (SPBCL) on an
amorphous carbon film is used to investigate the coarsening of ultrafine (1-3
nm) Au-Pt bimetallic nanoparticles as a function of solvent evaporation. In
such reactors, homogeneous Au-Pt nanoparticles are synthesized from metal ion
precursors in situ under electron irradiation. The non-uniform evaporation of
the thin polymer film not only concentrates the nanoparticles, but also
accelerates the coalescence kinetics at the receding polymer edges. Qualitative
analysis of the particle forces influencing coalescence suggests that capillary
dragging by the polymer edges plays a significant role in accelerating this
process. Taken together, this work: 1) provides fundamental insight into the
role of solvents in the chemistry and coarsening behavior of nanoparticles
during the synthesis of polyelemental nanostructures, 2) provides insight into
how particles form via the SPBCL process, and 3) shows how SPBCL-generated
domes, instead of liquid cells, can be used to study nanoparticle formation.
More generally, it shows why conventional models of particle coarsening, which
do not take into account solvent evaporation, cannot be used to describe what
is occurring in thin film, liquid-based syntheses of nanostructures.

We introduce a tool that allows us to do this even when the likelihood is not

Explicitly defining the likelihood often entails making heavy-handed

such assumptions. Our tool, which we call spectral backpropagation, allows us
to optimize it in much greater generality than what has been attempted before.
GANs can also be viewed as a technique for optimizing implicit likelihoods. We
study them using spectral backpropagation in order to demonstrate robustness
for high-dimensional problems, and identify two novel properties of the

very high likelihood, and (2) the eigenvectors of the metric induced by G over

by combining phase field models, which impose first-order dynamics, with
elasticity, to traverse a free energy landscape in search of minima.

surrogate optimization, sensitivity analysis and multifidelity modelling as an
alternate framework to explore phenomena controlled by energy extremization.
This combination of data-driven methods offers an alternative to the imposition
of first-order dynamics via phase field methods, and represents one approach to

The new concept is called ""Inductively Coupled Array"": INCA. Here, the physical
mechanism behind the collisionless (stochastic) heating is investigated by two
analytical models. Firstly, the electron heating rate in an array field
structure with an exponential spatial decay of the field in the direction
perpendicular to the plane is investigated by stochastically averaging single
electron trajectories. The approach is similar to the Lieberman model for the
classical stochastic heating in standard inductively coupled plasmas. This
analysis shows that classical stochastic heating by thermal motion along the
vertical direction makes a negligible contribution. However, there is a strong
collisonless non-local heating effect in the plane. In conclusion, heating is
non-local in the plane but local in the vertical direction. This insight allows
a straightforward solution of the collisionless Boltzmann equation which not
only confirms the results of the Lieberman model but provides also explicit
expressions for the complex conductivity. Based on the conductivity an
effective stochastic collision frequency, the complex damping coefficient and
the related field penetration of the field into the plasma is calculated.
Finally, elastic collisions with neutral background atoms are included in the
model and a condition for dominance of stochastic heating over Ohmic heating is
derived.

collision, in which the Moon accreted from the impact-generated debris disk.
However, such giant impacts are rare, and during its evolution the Earth
experienced many more smaller impacts, producing smaller satellites that
potentially coevolved. In the multiple-impact hypothesis of lunar formation,
the current Moon was produced from the mergers of several smaller satellites
(moonlets), each formed from debris disks produced by successive large impacts.
In the Myrs between impacts, a pre-existing moonlet tidally evolves outward
until a subsequent impact forms a new moonlet, at which point both moonlets
will tidally evolve until a merger or system disruption. In this work, we
examine the likelihood that pre-existing moonlets survive subsequent impact
events, and explore the dynamics of Earth-moonlet systems that contain two
moonlets generated Myrs apart. We demonstrate that pre-existing moonlets can
tidally migrate outward, remain stable during subsequent impacts, and later
merge with newly created moonlets (or re-collide with the Earth). Formation of
the Moon from the mergers of several moonlets could therefore be a natural
byproduct of the Earth's growth through multiple impacts. More generally, we
examine the likelihood and consequences of Earth having prior moons, and find
that the stability of moonlets against disruption by subsequent impacts implies
that several large impacts could post-date Moon formation.

which previous approaches based on small ball probabilities fail. We propose a
novel definition of generalized modes based on the concept of approximating
sequences, which reduce to the classical mode in certain situations that
include Gaussian priors but also exist for a more general class of priors. The
latter includes the case of priors that impose strict bounds on the admissible
parameters and in particular of uniform priors. For uniform priors defined by
random series with uniformly distributed coefficients, we show that generalized
MAP estimates -- but not classical MAP estimates -- can be characterized as
minimizers of a suitable functional that plays the role of a generalized
Onsager--Machlup functional. This is then used to show consistency of nonlinear
Bayesian inverse problems with uniform priors and Gaussian noise.

surface scattering experiments and, most recently, microscopy. The high
ionization potential of neutral helium atoms makes it difficult to build
efficient detectors. Therefore, it is important to develop beam sources with a
high centre line intensity. Several approaches for predicting the centre line
intensity exist, with the quitting surface model incorporating the largest
amount of physical dependencies. However, until now only a limited amount of
experimental data has been available. Here we present a study where we compare
the quitting surface model with an extensive set of experimental data. In the
quitting surface model the source is described as a sphere from where the
particles leave in a molecular flow determined by Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics.
We use numerical solutions of the Boltzmann equation to determine its
properties. The centre-line intensity is then calculated using an analytical
integral. This integral can be reduced to two cases, one which assumes a
continuously expanding beam until the skimmer aperture, and another which
assumes a quitting surface placed before the aperture. We compare the two cases
to experimental data with a nozzle diameter of 10 micron, skimmer diameters
ranging from 4 micron to 390 micron, a source pressure range from 2 to 190 bar,
and nozzle-skimmer distances between 17.3 mm and 5.3 mm. To support the two
analytical approaches, we have also performed equivalent ray tracing
simulations. We conclude that the quitting surface model predicts the centre
line intensity well for skimmers with a diameter larger than 120 micron when
using a beam expanding until the skimmer aperture. For the case of smaller
skimmers the trend is correct, but the absolute agreement not as good. We
propose several explanations for this, and test the ones that can be
implemented analytically.

events indicate a transition to a new regime of market behavior, particularly
given the dramatic fluctuations --- both gains and losses --- in the weeks
since. To illuminate this matter, we can apply a model grounded in the science
of complex systems, a model that demonstrated considerable success at
unraveling the stock-market dynamics from the 1980s through the 2000s. By using
large-scale comovement of stock prices as an early indicator of unhealthy
market dynamics, this work found that abrupt drops in a certain parameter $U$
provide an early warning of single-day panics and economic crises. Decreases in
$U$ indicate regimes of ""high co-movement"", a market behavior that is not the
same as volatility, though market volatility can be a component of co-movement.

significantly lower than for the period before. This decrease entered the

shown in the literature to have good statistical properties in a variety of

FORCE, a new algorithm to solve this SDP relaxation. Compared to the naive
interior point method, our method reduces the computational complexity of
solving the SDP from $\tilde{O}(d^7\log\epsilon^{-1})$ to
$\tilde{O}(d^{6}K^{-2}\epsilon^{-1})$ arithmetic operations for an
$\epsilon$-optimal solution. Our method combines a primal first-order method
with a dual optimality certificate search, which when successful, allows for
early termination of the primal method. We show for certain variable clustering
problems that, with high probability, FORCE is guaranteed to find the optimal
solution to the SDP relaxation and provide a certificate of exact optimality.
As verified by our numerical experiments, this allows FORCE to solve the P-W
SDP with dimensions in the hundreds in only tens of seconds. For a variation of
the P-W SDP where $K$ is not known a priori a slight modification of FORCE
reduces the computational complexity of solving this problem as well: from
$\tilde{O}(d^7\log\epsilon^{-1})$ using a standard SDP solver to
$\tilde{O}(d^{4}\epsilon^{-1})$.

a reservoir sampling procedure to maintain an external memory consisting of a
fixed number of past states. The algorithm allows a deep reinforcement learning
agent to learn online to preferentially remember those states which are found
to be useful to recall later on. Critically this method allows for efficient
online computation of gradient estimates with respect to the write process of
the external memory. Thus unlike most prior mechanisms for external memory it
is feasible to use in an online reinforcement learning setting.

  Exploitation",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CY stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Online learning algorithms, widely used to power search and content
optimization on the web, must balance exploration and exploitation, potentially
sacrificing the experience of current users for information that will lead to
better decisions in the future. Recently, concerns have been raised about
whether the process of exploration could be viewed as unfair, placing too much
burden on certain individuals or groups. Motivated by these concerns, we
initiate the study of the externalities of exploration - the undesirable side
effects that the presence of one party may impose on another - under the linear
contextual bandits model. We introduce the notion of a group externality,
measuring the extent to which the presence of one population of users impacts
the rewards of another. We show that this impact can in some cases be negative,
and that, in a certain sense, no algorithm can avoid it. We then study
externalities at the individual level, interpreting the act of exploration as
an externality imposed on the current user of a system by future users. This
drives us to ask under what conditions inherent diversity in the data makes
explicit exploration unnecessary. We build on a recent line of work on the
smoothed analysis of the greedy algorithm that always chooses the action that
currently looks optimal, improving on prior results to show that a greedy
approach almost matches the best possible Bayesian regret rate of any other
algorithm on the same problem instance whenever the diversity conditions hold,
and that this regret is at most $\tilde{O}(T^{1/3})$. Returning to group-level
effects, we show that under the same conditions, negative group externalities
essentially vanish under the greedy algorithm. Together, our results uncover a
sharp contrast between the high externalities that exist in the worst case, and
the ability to remove all externalities if the data is sufficiently diverse.

essential in non-invasive investigation for neuroanatomy. Historically,
multi-atlas segmentation (MAS) has been regarded as the de facto standard
method for whole brain segmentation. Recently, deep neural network approaches
have been applied to whole brain segmentation by learning random patches or 2D
slices. Yet, few previous efforts have been made on detailed whole brain
segmentation using 3D networks due to the following challenges: (1) fitting
entire whole brain volume into 3D networks is restricted by the current GPU
memory, and (2) the large number of targeting labels (e.g., > 100 labels) with
limited number of training 3D volumes (e.g., < 50 scans). In this paper, we
propose the spatially localized atlas network tiles (SLANT) method to
distribute multiple independent 3D fully convolutional networks to cover
overlapped sub-spaces in a standard atlas space. This strategy simplifies the
whole brain learning task to localized sub-tasks, which was enabled by combing
canonical registration and label fusion techniques with deep learning. To
address the second challenge, auxiliary labels on 5111 initially unlabeled
scans were created by MAS for pre-training. From empirical validation, the
state-of-the-art MAS method achieved mean Dice value of 0.76, 0.71, and 0.68,

laboratories for study of the low-metallicity stars we expect to encounter at
early epochs. But as our understanding of the $z>6$ universe has improved, it
has become clear that the majority of known XMPs within 100 Mpc host
significantly less prominent massive star populations than their
reionization-era counterparts, severely limiting their utility as testbeds for
interpreting spectral features found at the highest redshifts. Here we present
a new photometric selection technique designed to identify nearby XMPs
dominated by young stellar populations comparable to those expected in the
reionization era. We apply our technique to uncover candidate XMPs in SDSS
imaging at magnitudes $16<i'<23$, extending significantly below the
completeness limits of the SDSS spectroscopic survey. Spectroscopic
observations with the MMT confirm that 32 of the 53 uniformly metal-poor and
high specific star formation rate targets we observed have gas-phase oxygen

range of the lowest-metallicity galaxies known, $Z/Z_\odot<0.05$. Our
observations shed new light onto the longstanding mystery of He II emission in
star-forming galaxies: we find that the equivalent width of the He II $\lambda
4686$ high-ionization emission line does not scale with that of H$\beta$ in our
sample, suggesting that binary evolution or other processes on $>10$ Myr
timescales contribute substantially to the $\mathrm{He^+}$-ionizing photon
budget in this metallicity regime. Applying such selection techniques coupled
with deep spectroscopy to next-generation photometric surveys like LSST may
eventually provide a basis for an empirical understanding of metal-poor massive

The astrophysical processes responsible for the nucleosynthesis in stars often
take place far from the valley of stability, where experimental masses are not
known. In such cases, missing nuclear information must be provided by
theoretical predictions using extreme extrapolations. Bayesian machine learning
techniques can be applied to improve predictions by taking full advantage of
the information contained in the deviations between experimental and calculated
masses. We consider 10 global models based on nuclear Density Functional Theory
as well as two more phenomenological mass models. The emulators of S2n
residuals and credibility intervals defining theoretical error bars are
constructed using Bayesian Gaussian processes and Bayesian neural networks. We
consider a large training dataset pertaining to nuclei whose masses were
measured before 2003. For the testing datasets, we considered those exotic
nuclei whose masses have been determined after 2003. We then carried out
extrapolations towards the 2n dripline. While both Gaussian processes and
Bayesian neural networks reduce the rms deviation from experiment
significantly, GP offers a better and much more stable performance. The
increase in the predictive power is quite astonishing: the resulting rms
deviations from experiment on the testing dataset are similar to those of more
phenomenological models. The empirical coverage probability curves we obtain
match very well the reference values which is highly desirable to ensure
honesty of uncertainty quantification, and the estimated credibility intervals
on predictions make it possible to evaluate predictive power of individual

actions to find rewards. But these approaches struggle on sparse-reward domains
like Montezuma's Revenge where the probability that any random action sequence
leads to reward is extremely low. Recent algorithms have performed well on such
tasks by encouraging agents to visit new states or perform new actions in
relation to all prior training episodes (which we call across-training
novelty). But such algorithms do not consider whether an agent exhibits
intra-life novelty: doing something new within the current episode, regardless
of whether those behaviors have been performed in previous episodes. We
hypothesize that across-training novelty might discourage agents from
revisiting initially non-rewarding states that could become important stepping
stones later in training. We introduce Deep Curiosity Search (DeepCS), which
encourages intra-life exploration by rewarding agents for visiting as many
different states as possible within each episode, and show that DeepCS matches
the performance of current state-of-the-art methods on Montezuma's Revenge. We
further show that DeepCS improves exploration on Amidar, Freeway, Gravitar, and
Tutankham (many of which are hard exploration games). Surprisingly, DeepCS
doubles A2C performance on Seaquest, a game we would not have expected to
benefit from intra-life exploration because the arena is small and already
easily navigated by naive exploration techniques. In one run, DeepCS achieves a
maximum training score of 80,000 points on Seaquest, higher than any methods
other than Ape-X. The strong performance of DeepCS on these sparse- and
dense-reward tasks suggests that encouraging intra-life novelty is an
interesting, new approach for improving performance in Deep RL and motivates

corrects those eigenpairs by solving a hierarchy of linear problems in the

surfaces -- the sonic, Alfv\'en, and first plasma-$\beta$ unity surfaces --

transformations. Global numerical simulations and remote sensing observations
offer a natural mode for the study of these surfaces at large scales, thus
providing valuable context for the high-resolution in-situ measurements
expected from the soon-to-be-launched Parker Solar Probe (PSP). The present
study utilizes global three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the
solar wind to characterize the critical surfaces and investigate the flow in
propinquitous regions. Effects of solar activity are incorporated by varying
source magnetic dipole tilts and employing magnetogram-based boundary
conditions. A magnetohydrodynamic turbulence model is self-consistently coupled
to the bulk flow equations, enabling investigation of turbulence properties of
the flow in the vicinity of critical regions. The simulation results are
compared with a variety of remote sensing observations. A simulated PSP
trajectory is used to provide contextual predictions for the spacecraft in
terms of the computed critical surfaces. Broad agreement is seen in the
interpretation of the present results in comparison with existing remote
sensing results, both from heliospheric imaging and from radio scintillation
studies. The trajectory analyses show that the period of time that PSP is
likely to spend inside the $\beta=1$, sonic and Alfv\'en surfaces depends
sensitively on the degree of solar activity and the tilt of the solar dipole
and location of the heliospheric current sheet.

criterion for infinite crystals is consistently established at both continuum
and atom level under frameworks of a higher-order phenomenological theory. The
established criterion could consistently reproduce the well-known strain-based
lattice instability criteria, such as modified Born criterion,
{\Lambda}-criterion, as well as a higher-order one proposed by Bardenhagen et
al. Our results show that modified Born criterion is not as precise as the
{\Lambda}-criterion under heterogeneous stress states. Different from the
higher-order criterion, contributions from the third order gradients of
displacements are considered so that the well-known sign paradox in the first
strain-gradient theory could be reproduced. According to microscopic
comprehensions on the higher-order phenomenological theory, the sign paradox is
well clarified. Finally, the established criterion is employed to investigate
the elastic stabilities of single crystalline copper and aluminum. The obtained
results could well explain the singularities of elastic responses of the two

computer vision and artificial intelligence due to its challenges and wide
applications. State-of-the-art recurrent neural networks (RNN) based models map
an input sequence to a variable length output sequence, but are usually applied
in a black box manner and lack of transparency for further improvement, and the
maintaining of the entire past hidden states prevents parallel computation in a
sequence. In this paper, we investigate the intrinsic characteristics of text
recognition, and inspired by human cognition mechanisms in reading texts, we
propose a scene text recognition method with sliding convolutional attention
network (SCAN). Similar to the eye movement during reading, the process of SCAN
can be viewed as an alternation between saccades and visual fixations. Compared
to the previous recurrent models, computations over all elements of SCAN can be
fully parallelized during training. Experimental results on several challenging
benchmarks, including the IIIT5k, SVT and ICDAR 2003/2013 datasets, demonstrate
the superiority of SCAN over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both the

perturbations to the input images are sufficient to fool the most powerful deep
neural networks. Various defense methods have been proposed to address this
issue. However, they either require knowledge on the process of generating
adversarial examples, or are not robust against new attacks specifically
designed to penetrate the existing defense. In this work, we introduce
key-based network, a new detection-based defense mechanism to distinguish
adversarial examples from normal ones based on error correcting output codes,
using the binary code vectors produced by multiple binary classifiers applied
to randomly chosen label-sets as signatures to match normal images and reject
adversarial examples. In contrast to existing defense methods, the proposed
method does not require knowledge of the process for generating adversarial
examples and can be applied to defend against different types of attacks. For
the practical black-box and gray-box scenarios, where the attacker does not
know the encoding scheme, we show empirically that key-based network can
effectively detect adversarial examples generated by several state-of-the-art
attacks.

significantly, by up to 55% for neural networks trained for highly skewed
non-IID data, where each client device trains only on a single class of data.
We further show that this accuracy reduction can be explained by the weight
divergence, which can be quantified by the earth mover's distance (EMD) between
the distribution over classes on each device and the population distribution.
As a solution, we propose a strategy to improve training on non-IID data by
creating a small subset of data which is globally shared between all the edge

dimensionality of the nanostructure -- while the rate of intraband and
inter-valence-band transitions can be slowed down by the inverse factor,
$(a_B/L)^{N}$. Adding a hitherto underexplored degree of freedom to engineer
excitonic transition rates, this size dependence is of interest for various
opto-electronic applications. It also offers an interpretation of the

made in medical image computing, these deep models often suffer from degraded
performance when being applied to new test datasets with domain shift. In this
paper, we present a novel unsupervised domain adaptation approach for
segmentation tasks by designing semantic-aware generative adversarial networks
(GANs). Specifically, we transform the test image into the appearance of source
domain, with the semantic structural information being well preserved, which is
achieved by imposing a nested adversarial learning in semantic label space. In
this way, the segmentation DNN learned from the source domain is able to be
directly generalized to the transformed test image, eliminating the need of
training a new model for every new target dataset. Our domain adaptation
procedure is unsupervised, without using any target domain labels. The
adversarial learning of our network is guided by a GAN loss for mapping data
distributions, a cycle-consistency loss for retaining pixel-level content, and
a semantic-aware loss for enhancing structural information. We validated our
method on two different chest X-ray public datasets for left/right lung
segmentation. Experimental results show that the segmentation performance of
our unsupervised approach is highly competitive with the upper bound of
supervised transfer learning.

Assuming for simplicity that the quasidilaton scalar is on an attractor at the

perform a model calculation on a single-level quantum dot with Lorentzian

enhancement of the spin current in the transient regime is observed. In

the longer a certain behaviour has been going on, the less likely changes
becomes. This is a well-known sociological phenomenon observed in employment,
residence, addiction, criminal activity, wars, etc. Fundamentally, these all
exhibit a growing resistance to change over time. However, quantifying the
strength of this inertia is an ongoing challenge. Here we uncover anomalous
cumulative inertia (ACI), ubiquitous across human behavioural patterns, with a
much stronger memory dependence than previously anticipated. The behaviours
undergo substantially stronger inertia, invalidating classical predictions for
recovery, reconciliation, or rehabilitation times. We propose alternative
models for predictions of continued anomalous behaviour, and provide means of
identifying whether such behaviour is present. The result is a paradigm shift
in our understanding of human activity from burstiness to inertia. Our results
demonstrate how non-equilibrium models using fractional calculus aptly describe
resistance to behavioural change, and produce novel predictions for e.g.
rehabilitation of convicted individuals. The presence of anomalous cumulative
inertia qualitatively affects the predictions which can be made for behavioural
change, and thus forecasts which of these are more or less changeable. These
findings are critically important for e.g. recidivism studies and public policy
making, by determining more successful intervention strategies and populations
where these interventions are most likely to succeed.

superfluid density. Mutual inductance is a highly sensitive method for
characterizing thin films; however, in traditional mutual inductance
measurements, the measured response is a non-trivial average over the area of
the mutual inductance coils, which are typically of millimeter size. Here we
image localized, isolated features in the diamagnetic susceptibility of
{\delta}-doped SrTiO3, the 2-DES at the interface between LaAlO3 and SrTiO3,
and Nb superconducting thin film systems using scanning superconducting quantum
interference device susceptometry, with spatial resolution as fine as 0.7
{\mu}m. We show that these features can be modeled as locally suppressed
superfluid density, with a single parameter that characterizes the strength of
each feature. This method provides a systematic means of finding and
quantifying submicron defects in two-dimensional superconductors.

various physical processes on lattices. In the continuum limit, master
equations lead to Fokker-Planck partial differential equations that represent
the dynamics of physical systems in continuous spaces. Over the last few
decades, nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations have become very popular in
condensed matter physics and in statistical physics. Numerical solutions of
these equations require the use of discretization schemes. However, the
discrete evolution equation obtained by the discretization of a Fokker-Planck
partial differential equation depends on the specific discretization scheme. In
general, the discretized form is different from the master equation that has
generated the respective Fokker-Planck equation in the continuum limit.
Therefore, the knowledge of the master equation associated with a given
Fokker-Planck equation is extremely important for the correct numerical
integration of the latter, since it provides a unique, physically motivated
discretization scheme. This paper shows that the Kinetic Interaction Principle
(KIP) that governs the particle kinetics of many body systems, introduced in
[G. Kaniadakis, Physica A, 296, 405 (2001)], univocally defines a very simple
master equation that in the continuum limit yields the nonlinear Fokker-Planck

inspired by the human memory models in the field of cognitive neuroscience to
enhance information processing and transmission between adjacent RNNs' units.
The proposed framework for RNNs consists of three stages that is working
memory, forget, and long-term store. The first stage includes taking input data
into sensory memory and transferring it to working memory for preliminary
treatment. And the second stage mainly focuses on proactively forgetting the
secondary information rather than the primary in the working memory. And
finally, we get the long-term store normally using some kind of RNN's unit. Our
framework, which is generalized and simple, is evaluated on 6 datasets which
fall into 3 different tasks, corresponding to text classification, image
classification and language modelling. Experiments reveal that our framework
can obviously improve the performance of traditional recurrent neural networks.
And exploratory task shows the ability of our framework of correctly forgetting
the secondary information.

presented in the Coulomb blockade regime of electron transport. The model
magnetic shuttle device considered comprises a movable metallic grain suspended
between two magnetic leads, which are kept at different temperatures and
assumed to be fully spin polarized with antiparallel magnetizations. For a
given temperature difference shuttling is found to occur for a region of
external magnetic fields between a lower and an upper critical field strength,
which separate the shuttling regime from normal small-amplitude ""vibronic""

constant value in the high temperature limit and that the shuttle instability
domain expands with a decrease of the temperature, (ii) the lower critical
magnetic field depends not only on the temperature independent phenomenological
friction coefficient used in the model but also on intrinsic friction (which
vanishes in the high temperature limit) caused by magnetic exchange forces and
electron tunneling between the quantum dot and the leads. The feasibility of

$M_{i,j}=0$ for every distinct non-adjacent vertices $i$ and $j$ in $G$. For an
integer $n$, a graph $H$, and a field $\mathbb{F}$, let $g(n,H,\mathbb{F})$
denote the maximum possible minrank over $\mathbb{F}$ of an $n$-vertex graph
whose complement contains no copy of $H$. In this paper we study this quantity
for various graphs $H$ and fields $\mathbb{F}$. For finite fields, we prove by
a probabilistic argument a general lower bound on $g(n,H,\mathbb{F})$, which
yields a nearly tight bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n}/\log n)$ for the triangle
$H=K_3$. For the real field, we prove by an explicit construction that for

increasingly being used in the context of binary classification. These complex
performance measures are typically not even decomposable, that is, the loss
evaluated on a batch of samples cannot typically be expressed as a sum or
average of losses evaluated at individual samples, which in turn requires new
theoretical and methodological developments beyond standard treatments of
supervised learning. In this paper, we advance this understanding of binary
classification for complex performance measures by identifying two key
properties: a so-called Karmic property, and a more technical
threshold-quasi-concavity property, which we show is milder than existing
structural assumptions imposed on performance measures. Under these properties,
we show that the Bayes optimal classifier is a threshold function of the
conditional probability of positive class. We then leverage this result to come
up with a computationally practical plug-in classifier, via a novel threshold
estimator, and further, provide a novel statistical analysis of classification
error with respect to complex performance measures.

freely via particle-hole exchange, subject to both on-site exclusion and
prohibition of A-B nearest-neighbor pairs. As an athermal system, the overall
densities are the only control parameters. As the densities increase, an
entropically driven phase transition occurs, leading to ordered states with A-
and B-rich domains separated by hole-rich interfaces. Using Monte Carlo
simulations, we analyze the effect of imposing a drive on this system, biasing
particle moves along one direction. Our study parallels that for a driven Ising
lattice gas -- the Katz-Lebowitz-Spohn (KLS) model, which displays atypical
collective behavior, e.g., structure factors with discontinuity singularities
and ordered states with domains only parallel to the drive. Here, other novel
features emerge, including structure factors with kink singularities (best
fitted to |q|), maxima at non-vanishing wavevector values, oscillating
correlation functions, and ordering into multiple striped domains perpendicular
to the drive, with a preferred wavelength depending on density and drive
intensity. Moreover, the (hole-rich) interfaces between the domains are
statistically rough (whether driven or not), in sharp contrast with those in
the KLS model, in which the drive suppresses interfacial roughness. Defining a
novel order parameter (to account for the emergence of multistripe states), we
map out the phase diagram in the density-drive plane and present preliminary
evidence for a critical phase in this driven lattice gas.

antibunching microscopy or super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI),
provides superresolution through a correlation analysis of antibunching of

For correlation order $m$ the PSF in the signal is effectively taken to the
$m$th power, and is thus directly shrunk by the factor $\sqrt{m}$. Combined
with deconvolution a close to linear resolution improvement of factor $m$ can
be obtained. Yet, analysis of high correlation orders is challenging, what
limits the achievable resolutions. Here we propose to use three dimensional
structured illumination along with $m$th-order correlation analysis to obtain
an enhanced scaling of up to $m+m=2m$. Including the stokes shift or plasmonic
sub-wavelength illumination enhancements beyond $2m$ can be achieved. Hence,
resolutions far below the diffraction limit in full 3D imaging can potentially
be achieved already with low correlation orders. Since ICM operates in the
linear regime our approach may be particularly promising for enhancing the
resolution in biological imaging at low illumination levels.

characterized by a gradual swelling of the overlying streamer, lasting hours to
days, followed by a slow, wide CME, generally exhibiting a 3-part structure,
which leaves the streamer significantly depleted in its wake. We identify 909
SBO events in the LASCO/C2 observations between 1996 and 2015. The average
blowout lasts for 40.5 hours but the evacuation can take days for some events.
SBO-CMEs are wider and more massive than the average CME. Their properties
generally vary during and between solar cycles. Their minimum (maximum) monthly
occurrence rate of one (six) events in cycle 23 has doubled in cycle 24---a
probable manifestation of the weaker global fields in the current cycle. The
locations of SBOs follow the tilt of the global dipole (but not from 2014

morphology at a much higher rate (61%) than regular CMEs (40%). We propose that
these characteristics are consistent with SBOs arising from extended polarity
inversion lines outside active regions (e.g. quiet sun and polar crown
filaments) through the release, via reconnection, of magnetic energy, likely
accumulated via differential rotation.

neutron-capture elements follow a low-metallicity s-process pattern, while the
heavier neutron-capture elements above Eu follow an r-process pattern. The Pb
abundance is high, in line with an s-process origin. Thorium is also detected,
as expected from an r-process origin, as Th is not produced in the s-process.
We employ nucleosynthesis model predictions that take an initial r-process
enhancement into account, and then determine the mass transfer of carbon and
s-process material from a putative more massive companion onto the observed
star. The resulting abundances agree well with the observed pattern. We
conclude that J0949-1617 is the first bonafide CEMP-r+s star identified. This

neutron-capture element patterns that originate from neither the r- or
s-process alone. We speculate that J0949-1617 formed in an environment similar
to those of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies like Tucana III and Reticulum II, which

osmosis, as the movement of fluids is called in biology. Indeed, the movement
of fluids through channel proteins (that have a hole down their middle) is
fluidics on an atomic scale. Ionic fluids are complex fluids, with energy
stored in many ways. Ionic fluids flow driven by gradients of concentration,
chemical and electrical potential, and hydrostatic pressure. Each flow is
classically described by its own field theory, independent of the others, but
of course, in reality every gradient drives every kind of flow to a varying
extent. Combining field equations is tricky and so the theory of complex fluids
derives the equations, rather than assumes their interactions. When field
equations are derived, rather than assumed, their variables are consistent.
That is to say all variables satisfy all equations under all conditions with
one set of parameters. Here we treat a classical osmotic cell in this spirit,
using a sharp interface method to derive boundary conditions consistent with
all flows and fields. We allow volume to change with concentration, since
changes of volume are a property of ionic solutions known to all who make them
in the laboratory. We consider flexible and inflexible membranes. We show how
to combine the energetics of the membrane with the energetics of the
surrounding complex fluids. The results seem general but need application to
specific situations of technological, biological and experimental importance
before the consequences of consistency can be understood.

attribute of interest from a free text input. Most past related work on
extraction of missing attribute values work with a closed world assumption with
the possible set of values known beforehand, or use dictionaries of values and
hand-crafted features. How can we discover new attribute values that we have
never seen before? Can we do this with limited human annotation or supervision?
We study this problem in the context of product catalogs that often have
missing values for many attributes of interest.
  In this work, we leverage product profile information such as titles and
descriptions to discover missing values of product attributes. We develop a
novel deep tagging model OpenTag for this extraction problem with the following
contributions: (1) we formalize the problem as a sequence tagging task, and
propose a joint model exploiting recurrent neural networks (specifically,
bidirectional LSTM) to capture context and semantics, and Conditional Random
Fields (CRF) to enforce tagging consistency, (2) we develop a novel attention
mechanism to provide interpretable explanation for our model's decisions, (3)
we propose a novel sampling strategy exploring active learning to reduce the
burden of human annotation. OpenTag does not use any dictionary or hand-crafted
features as in prior works. Extensive experiments in real-life datasets in
different domains show that OpenTag with our active learning strategy discovers
new attribute values from as few as 150 annotated samples (reduction in 3.3x
amount of annotation effort) with a high F-score of 83%, outperforming
state-of-the-art models.

learning a useful model in the approximate setting is challenging. In this
context, an important question is the loss function used for model learning as
varying the loss function can have a remarkable impact on effectiveness of
planning. Recently Farahmand et al. (2017) proposed a value-aware model
learning (VAML) objective that captures the structure of value function during
model learning. Using tools from Asadi et al. (2018), we show that minimizing
the VAML objective is in fact equivalent to minimizing the Wasserstein metric.
This equivalence improves our understanding of value-aware models, and also
creates a theoretical foundation for applications of Wasserstein in model-based
reinforcement~learning.

methods for reward estimation by using expert state trajectories and action
pairs. However, there are cases where complete or good action information
cannot be obtained from expert demonstrations. We propose a novel reinforcement
learning method in which the agent learns an internal model of observation on
the basis of expert-demonstrated state trajectories to estimate rewards without
completely learning the dynamics of the external environment from state-action
pairs. The internal model is obtained in the form of a predictive model for the
given expert state distribution. During reinforcement learning, the agent
predicts the reward as a function of the difference between the actual state
and the state predicted by the internal model. We conducted multiple
experiments in environments of varying complexity, including the Super Mario

placed on the transient and scattering boundary conditions within the

dimensional analysis and the application of probability density functions,
which allows for a timescale separation. Stationary in-cylinder pressure
measurements are used as input values and, according to the transient behavior,
modified with an own part-load model. A turbocharged SI race engine is equipped
with 70 thermocouples at various positions in proximity to the combustion
chamber. Differentiating from already published works, the method deals with
the transient engine behavior during a race lap, which undergoes a frequency
range of 0.1-1 Hz. This includes engine speed build-ups under gear changes,
torque variations, or the transition from fired to coasting conditions.
Different thermal behaviors of various measuring positions can be simulated
successfully. Additionally, cylinder individual temperature effects resulting
from an unsymmetrical ignition sequence and different volumetric efficiencies
with unequal residual gas can be predicted. Up to a few percent, the energy
balance of the water jacket is fulfilled and variations of water inlet
temperatures can be simulated accurately enough.
