partial differential equations. We provide both in deterministic and stochastic
case the existence of a maximal defined solution for the problem and we provide
suitable blow-up criterion. The key idea is the use of the paradifferential
operator calculus in order to reduce the fully nonlinear problem into an
abstract quasilinear (stochastic) parabolic equation. This allows us to use
some recent results on abstract quasilinear (stochastic) evolution equations in
Banach spaces. To do so, we analyse the properties of the paradifferential
operator, in light of known results on the boundedness of the
$\mathcal{H}^{\infty}$-calculus for pseudodifferential operator. Finally, we
extend the theory just developed to cover high order fully nonlinear parabolic
(S)PDEs.

achieving perfect secrecy without requiring a secret key has been receiving
growing attention within the past decade. The vast majority of the existing
studies in the area of physical layer security focus exclusively on the
scenarios where the channel inputs are Gaussian distributed. However, in
practice, the signals employed for transmission are drawn from discrete signal
constellations such as phase shift keying and quadrature amplitude modulation.
Hence, understanding the impact of the finite-alphabet input constraints and
designing secure transmission schemes under this assumption is a mandatory step
towards a practical implementation of physical layer security. With this
motivation, this article reviews recent developments on physical layer security
with finite-alphabet inputs. We explore transmit signal design algorithms for
single-antenna as well as multi-antenna wiretap channels under different
assumptions on the channel state information at the transmitter. Moreover, we
present a review of the recent results on secure transmission with discrete
signaling for various scenarios including multi-carrier transmission systems,
broadcast channels with confidential messages, cognitive multiple access and
relay networks. Throughout the article, we stress the important behavioral
differences of discrete versus Gaussian inputs in the context of the physical

Gaussian and fading wiretap channels, and we discuss some open problems and

developed, which is applicable to different DNN types, sizes, and application

achieve a fine-grained tradeoff between accuracy and compression ratio. It
applies to both fully-connected and convolutional layers and contains a
mathematically rigorous proof of the effectiveness of the method. The proposed
algorithm reduces computational complexity per layer from O($n^2$) to O($n\log
n$) and storage complexity from O($n^2$) to O($n$), both for training and
inference. The hardware part consists of highly efficient Field Programmable

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves at least
152X speedup and 71X energy efficiency gain compared with IBM TrueNorth

maturation, a cyclic process of mutation and selection. At the end of affinity
maturation, a number of cells sharing the same ancestor (i.e. in the same
""clonal family"") are released from the germinal center, their amino acid
frequency profile reflects the allowed and disallowed substitutions at each
position. These clonal-family-specific frequency profiles, called ""substitution
profiles"", are useful for studying the course of affinity maturation as well as
for antibody engineering purposes. However, most often only a single sequence
is recovered from each clonal family in a sequencing experiment, making it
impossible to construct a clonal-family-specific substitution profile. Given
the public release of many high-quality large B cell receptor datasets, one may
ask whether it is possible to use such data in a prediction model for
clonal-family-specific substitution profiles. In this paper, we present the
method ""Substitution Profiles Using Related Families"" (SPURF), a penalized
tensor regression framework that integrates information from a rich assemblage
of datasets to predict the clonal-family-specific substitution profile for any
single input sequence. Using this framework, we show that substitution profiles
from similar clonal families can be leveraged together with simulated
substitution profiles and germline gene sequence information to improve
prediction. We fit this model on a large public dataset and validate the
robustness of our approach on an external dataset. Furthermore, we provide a
command-line tool in an open-source software package

prediction using our pre-fit models.

case is when the Stokes lines emanate from phase space caustics of a complex
trajectory manifold. In this case, symmetry determines that to second order
there is a double coverage of the space, one portion of which is unphysical.
Building on the seminal but laconic findings of Adachi, we show that the
deviation from second order can be used to rigorously determine the Stokes
lines and therefore the region of the space that should be removed. The method
has applications to wavepacket reconstruction from complex valued classical
trajectories. With a rigorous method in hand for removing unphysical
divergences, we demonstrate excellent wavepacket reconstruction for the Morse,
Quartic, Coulomb and Eckart systems.

irregulars and dwarfs. Of these, we could use $\sim$490 LSBGs to study their HI
and stellar masses, colours and colour magnitude diagrams, and local
environment, compare them with normal, High Surface Brightness (HSB) galaxies
and determine the differences between the three morphological classes. We found
that LSB and HSB galaxies span a similar range in HI and stellar masses, and
have a similar $M_{\rm HI}$/$M_{\star}$--$M_{\star}$ relationship. Among the
LSBGs, as expected, the spirals have the highest average HI and stellar masses,
both of about 10$^{9.8}$ $M_\odot$. The LSGBs' ($g$--$r$) integrated colour is
nearly constant as function of HI mass for all classes. In the colour magnitude
diagram, the spirals are spread over the red and blue regions whereas the
irregulars and dwarfs are confined to the blue region. The spirals also exhibit
a steeper slope in the $M_{\rm HI}$/$M_{\star}$--$M_{\star}$ plane. Within
their local environment we confirmed that LSBGs are more isolated than HSB
galaxies, and LSB spirals more isolated than irregulars and dwarfs.
Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical tests on the HI mass, stellar mass and number of
neighbours indicates that the spirals are a statistically different population
from the dwarfs and irregulars. This suggests that the spirals may have
different formation and HI evolution than the dwarfs and irregulars.

indicative of primordial circumstellar disks. We present here the resulting
comprehensive sample of 288 young disk-bearing stars from B through M spectral
types and analysis of their associated $K2$ light curves. Using statistics of
periodicity and symmetry, we categorize each light curves into eight different
variability classes, notably including ""dippers"" (fading events), ""bursters""
(brightening events), stochastic, and quasi-periodic types. Nearly all (96\%)
of disk-bearing YSOs are identified as variable at 30-minute cadence with the
sub-1\% precision of {\em K2}. Combining our variability classifications with
(circum)stellar properties, we find that the bursters, stochastic sources, and
the largest amplitude quasi-periodic stars have larger infrared colors, and
hence stronger circumstellar disks. They also tend to have larger H$\alpha$
equivalent widths, indicative of higher accretion rates. The dippers, on the
other hand, cluster toward moderate infrared colors and low H$\alpha$. Using
resolved disk observations, we further find that the latter favor high
inclinations, apart from a few notable exceptions with close to face-on disks.
These observations support the idea that YSO time domain properties are
dependent on several factors including accretion rate and view angle.

measure the arising magnetization due to the circulation of electrons in the
bulk and the occurrence of topologically protected edge channels due to the
emergent field of a skyrmion crystal. Both observables quantify the topological
Hall effect and distinguish skyrmions from antiskyrmions by sign. Additionally,
we predict a magnetoelectric effect in skyrmion crystals, which is the
generation of a magnetization (polarization) by application of an electric
(magnetic) field. This effect is quantified by spin toroidization and
magnetoelectric polarizability. The dependence of the transverse
magnetoelectric effect on the skyrmion helicity fits that of the classical
toroidal moment of the spin texture and allows to differentiate skyrmion
helicities: it is largest for Bloch skyrmions and zero for Neel skyrmions. We

function method, the expressions of Andreev reflection coefficient and
conductance are obtained. A strong magnetoanisotropic spin-triplet Andreev
reflection is shown, and the magnetoanisotropic period is $\pi$ instead of
$2\pi$ as in the conventional magnetoanisotropic system. We demonstrate a
significant increase of the spin-triplet Andreev reflection for the single-band
Ising superconductor. Furthermore, the dependence of the Andreev reflection on
the incident energy and incident angle are also investigated. A complete
Andreev reflection can occur when the incident energy is equal to the
superconductor gap, regardless of the Fermi energy (spin polarization) of the
ferromagnet. For the suitable oblique incidence, the spin-triplet Andreev
reflection can be strongly enhanced. In addition, the conductance
spectroscopies of both zero bias and finite bias are studied, and the influence
of gate voltage, exchange energy, and spin-orbit coupling on the conductance
spectroscopy are discussed in detail. The conductance reveals a strong
magnetoanisotropy with period $\pi$ as the Andreev reflection coefficient. When
the magnetization direction is parallel to the junction plane, a large
conductance peak always emerges at the superconductor gap. This work offers a
comprehensive and systematic study of the spin-triplet Andreev reflection, and
has underlying application of $\pi$-periodic spin valve in spintronics.

computing an MWT is NP-hard, Beirouti and Snoeyink showed in 1998 that
computing provably optimal solutions for MWT instances of up to 80,000
uniformly distributed points is possible, making use of clever heuristics that
are based on geometric insights. We show that these techniques can be refined
and extended to instances of much bigger size and different type, based on an
array of modifications and parallelizations in combination with more efficient
geometric encodings and data structures. As a result, we are able to solve MWT
instances with up to 30,000,000 uniformly distributed points in less than 4
minutes to provable optimality. Moreover, we can compute optimal solutions for
a vast array of other benchmark instances that are not uniformly distributed,
including normally distributed instances (up to 30,000,000 points), all point
sets in the TSPLIB (up to 85,900 points), and VLSI instances with up to 744,710

as well as the huge reality gap between simulation and real world. To bridge
the reality gap, we introduce a Sim-to-Real framework to directly transfer
learning from simulation to real world via graph convolutional neural network
(CNN) - by abstracting partially observable mobile network into graph, then
distilling domain-variant irregular graph into domain-invariant tensor in
locally Euclidean space as input to CNN -, domain randomization and multi-task
learning. We use a novel self-play mechanism to encourage competition among DRL
agents for best record on multiple tasks via simulated annealing, just like
athletes compete for world record in decathlon. We also propose a decentralized
multi-agent, competitive and cooperative DRL method to coordinate the actions
of multi-cells to maximize global reward and minimize negative impact to
neighbor cells. Using 6 field trials on commercial mobile networks, we
demonstrate for the first time that a DRL agent can successfully transfer

Superthermal photon bunching has been reported for a number of optical
microcavity systems that exhibit processes like superradiance or mode
competition. We show that a superthermal photon number distribution cannot be
constructed from the principle of maximum entropy, if only the intensity and
the second-order autocorrelation are given. However, for bimodal systems an
unbiased superthermal distribution can be constructed from second-order
correlations and the intensities alone. Our findings suggest modeling
superthermal single-mode distributions by a mixture of a thermal and a lasing
like state and thus reveal a generic mechanism in the photon probability
distribution responsible for creating superthermal photon bunching. We relate
our general considerations to a physical system, a (single-emitter) bimodal
laser, and show that its statistics can be approximated and understood within
our proposed model. Furthermore the excellent agreement of the statistics of
the bimodal laser and our model reveal that the bimodal laser is an ideal
source of bunched photons, in the sense that it can generate statistics that
contain no other features but the superthermal bunching.

  triangulations whose building blocks are balls","38 pages, generous quantity of figures",,,,"math.CO gr-qc math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Colored triangulations offer a generalization of combinatorial maps to higher
dimensions. Just like maps are gluings of polygons, colored triangulations are
built as gluings of special, higher-dimensional building blocks, such as
octahedra, which we call colored building blocks and known in the dual as
bubbles. A colored building block is determined by its boundary triangulation,
which in the case of polygons is simply characterized by its length. In three
dimensions, colored building blocks are labeled by some 2D triangulations and
those homeomorphic to the 3-ball are labeled by the subset of planar ones.
Similarly to Euler's formula in 2D which provides an upper bound to the number
of vertices at fixed number of polygons with given lengths, we look in three
dimensions for an upper bound on the number of edges at fixed number of given
colored building blocks. In this article we solve this problem when all colored
building blocks, except possibly one, are homeomorphic to the 3-ball. To do
this, we find a characterization of the way a colored building block
homeomorphic to the ball has to be glued to other blocks of arbitrary topology
in a colored triangulation which maximizes the number of edges. This local
characterization can be extended to the whole triangulation as long as there is
at most one colored building block which is not a 3-ball. The triangulations
obtained this way are in bijection with trees. The number of edges is given as
an independent sum over the building blocks of such a triangulation. In the
case of all colored building blocks being homeomorphic to the 3-ball, we show
that these triangulations are homeomorphic to the 3-sphere. Those results were
only known for the octahedron and for melonic building blocks before. This
article is self-contained and can be used as an introduction to colored
triangulations and their bubbles from a purely combinatorial point of view.

spectrally stable with respect to their nonlinear modulation equations under

obstacle vertically mounted on the cathode tray acts as an obstacle to the flow
of dust particles. The controlled dust flow is generated by reducing the mass
flow of the neutrals through a mass flow controller. The flowing dust particles
are repelled by the electrostatic field of the negatively charged sphere and a
microparticle free region (dust void) is formed surrounding the obstacle. The
far particles are attracted towards the floating obstacle and reflected back
when they have arrived at a minimum distance, causing a ring shaped structure
around the obstacle. We characterize the shape of this structure over a range
of dust flow speeds and obstacle biases. For a supersonic flow of dust fluid
around a negatively biased obstacle, a bow shock is formed on the upstream side
of the sphere, while the generation of wave structures is observed on the
downstream side for a particular range of flow velocities. Reynolds numbers in
this case is estimated as $R_e \gtrsim 50$. This wave structure reminds of the

modified measure theory, the theory that does not use the determinant of the
metric to construct the invariant volume element. As the outcome of this
theory, the string tension is not placed ad hoc but is derived. When the
charges are presented, the tension undergoes alterations. In the string meson
model there are one string and two opposite charges at the endpoints. In the
string baryon model there are two strings, two pairs of opposite charges at the
endpoints and one additional charge at the intersection point, the point where
these two strings are connected. The application of the modified measure theory
is justified because the Neumann boundary conditions are obtained dynamically
at every point where the charge is located and Dirichlet boundary conditions
arise naturally at the intersection point. In particular, the Neumann boundary
conditions that are obtained at the intersection point differ from that
considered before by 't Hooft in [hep-th/0408148] and are stronger, which
appears to solve the nonlocality problem that was encountered in the standard
measure approach. The solutions of the equations of motion are presented.
Assuming that each endpoint is the dynamical massless particle, the Regge
trajectory with the slope parameter that depends on three different tensions is
obtained.

algorithm for non-convex Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) through the lens of
metastability, adopting some techniques from Berglund and Gentz (2003.
  For a particular local optimum of the empirical risk, with an arbitrary
initialization, we show that, with high probability, at least one of the
following two events will occur: (1) the Langevin trajectory ends up somewhere
outside the $\varepsilon$-neighborhood of this particular optimum within a
short recurrence time; (2) it enters this $\varepsilon$-neighborhood by the
recurrence time and stays there until a potentially exponentially long escape
time. We call this phenomenon empirical metastability.
  This two-timescale characterization aligns nicely with the existing
literature in the following two senses. First, the effective recurrence time
(i.e., number of iterations multiplied by stepsize) is dimension-independent,
and resembles the convergence time of continuous-time deterministic Gradient
Descent (GD). However unlike GD, the Langevin algorithm does not require strong
conditions on local initialization, and has the possibility of eventually
visiting all optima. Second, the scaling of the escape time is consistent with
the Eyring-Kramers law, which states that the Langevin scheme will eventually
visit all local minima, but it will take an exponentially long time to transit
among them. We apply this path-wise concentration result in the context of
statistical learning to examine local notions of generalization and optimality.

problem. Given a set of n items with different weights and values, it asks to
pick the most valuable subset whose total weight is below a capacity threshold
T. Despite its wide applicability in various areas in Computer Science,
Operations Research, and Finance, the best known running time for the problem
is O(Tn). The main result of our work is an improved algorithm running in time
O(TD), where D is the number of distinct weights. Previously, faster runtimes
for Knapsack were only possible when both weights and values are bounded by M
and V respectively, running in time O(nMV) [Pisinger'99]. In comparison, our
algorithm implies a bound of O(nM^2) without any dependence on V, or O(nV^2)
without any dependence on M. Additionally, for the unbounded Knapsack problem,
we provide an algorithm running in time O(M^2) or O(V^2). Both our algorithms
match recent conditional lower bounds shown for the Knapsack problem [Cygan et
al'17, K\""unnemann et al'17].
  We also initiate a systematic study of general capacitated dynamic
programming, of which Knapsack is a core problem. This problem asks to compute
the maximum weight path of length k in an edge- or node-weighted directed
acyclic graph. In a graph with m edges, these problems are solvable by dynamic
programming in time O(km), and we explore under which conditions the dependence
on k can be eliminated. We identify large classes of graphs where this is
possible and apply our results to obtain linear time algorithms for the problem
of k-sparse Delta-separated sequences. The main technical innovation behind our
results is identifying and exploiting concavity that appears in relaxations and
subproblems of the tasks we consider.

increasingly available imaging technique for ophthalmic microsurgery that
provides high-resolution cross-sectional information of the surgical scene. We
propose to build on its desirable qualities and present a method for tracking
the orientation and location of a surgical needle. Thereby, we enable direct
analysis of instrument-tissue interaction directly in OCT space without complex
multimodal calibration that would be required with traditional instrument
tracking methods. Method. The intersection of the needle with the iOCT scan is
detected by a peculiar multi-step ellipse fitting that takes advantage of the
directionality of the modality. The geometric modelling allows us to use the
ellipse parameters and provide them into a latency aware estimator to infer the
5DOF pose during needle movement. Results. Experiments on phantom data and
ex-vivo porcine eyes indicate that the algorithm retains angular precision
especially during lateral needle movement and provides a more robust and

The objective of this review is to provide a general framework and terminology
for particle resuspension while highlighting the future developments needed to
deepen our understanding of these phenomena. For that purpose, the manuscript
is organized with respect to three mechanisms identified in particle
resuspension, namely: the incipient motion of particles (i.e. how particles are
set in motion), their migration on the surface (i.e. rolling or sliding motion)
and their re-entrainment in the flow (i.e. their motion in the near-wall region
after detachment). Recent measurements and simulations of particle resuspension
are used to underline our current understanding of each mechanism for particle
resuspension. These selected examples also highlight the limitations in the
present knowledge of particle resuspension, while providing insights into
future developments that need to be addressed. In particular, the paper
addresses the issue of adhesion forces between complex surfaces - where more
detailed characterizations of adhesion force distributions are needed - and the
issue of particle sliding/rolling motion on the surface - which can lead to
particles halting/being trapped in regions with high adhesion forces.

the disc $D^8$ to the space $\Sigma ^{4}\mathbb{R} P^2$ by the generator of the

$(G_{5,2}/G_{4,2})/T^5$ is homotopy equivalent to $\partial \Delta _{5,2}\ast

  interests-Social Contents Modeling","ACM Multimedia",,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Exponential growth of social media consumption demands effective user
interests-social contents modeling for more personalized recommendation and
social media summarization. However, due to the heterogeneous nature of social
contents, traditional approaches lack the ability of capturing the hidden
semantic correlations across these multi-modal data, which leads to semantic
gaps between social content understanding and user interests. To effectively
bridge the semantic gaps, we propose a novel deep learning framework for user
interests-social contents modeling. We first mine and parse data, i.e. textual
content, visual content, social context and social relation, from heterogeneous
social media feeds. Then, we design a two-branch network to map the social
contents and users into a same latent space. Particularly, the network is
trained by a large margin objective that combines a cross-instance distance
constraint with a within-instance semantic-preserving constraint in an end-to-
end manner. At last, a Deep Semantic-Preserving Embedding (D-Sempre) is
learned, and the ranking results can be given by calculating distances between
social contents and users. To demonstrate the effectiveness of D-Sempre in user
interests-social contents modeling, we construct a Twitter dataset and conduct
extensive experiments on it. As a result, D-Sempre effectively integrates the
multi-modal data from heterogeneous social media feeds and captures the hidden
semantic correlations between users' interests and social contents.

translating instances in a highly-structured latent space. Specifically, we
jointly learn a deep attention encoder, and the instancelevel correspondences

attentional resources should be allocated to maximize performance. Here, we
investigate the optimal strategy for allocating a fixed resource budget E among
N items when on each trial, only one item gets probed. We develop an efficient
algorithm that, for any concave utility function, reduces the N-dimensional

resource to items with a nonzero probability of being probed. Our work opens
the door to normatively guided studies of attentional allocation.

refine a base binary vector by progressively adding binary residual vectors to
meet the desired accuracy. The refined vector enables efficient implementation
of exhaustive similarity computation with bit-wise operations, followed by a

proposed algorithms are integrated into an end-to-end multi-GPU system that
retrieves thousands of top items from over a billion candidates in real-time.
The RBE model and the retrieval system were evaluated with data from a major

representation and the full precision model for semantic embedding, RBE
significantly outperformed the former, and filled in over 80% of the AUC gap

a simple setup to test compositional behaviour and show that it is
theoretically possible for a standard RNN to learn to behave compositionally in
this domain when trained with standard gradient descent and provided with
additional supervision. We then remove this additional supervision and perform
a search over a large number of model initializations to investigate the
proportion of RNNs that can still converge to a compositional solution. We
discover that a small but non-negligible proportion of RNNs do reach partial
compositional solutions even without special architectural constraints. This
suggests that a combination of gradient descent and evolutionary strategies
directly favouring the minority models that developed more compositional
approaches might suffice to lead standard RNNs towards compositional solutions.

patients' simulation. Dixon reconstructed water, fat and in-phase images
obtained from a conventional dual gradient-recalled echo sequence were used to
generate sCT images. A conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) was
trained in a paired fashion on 2D transverse slices of 32 prostate cancer
patients. The trained network was tested on the remaining patients to generate
sCT images. For 30 patients in the test set, dose recalculations of the
clinical plan were performed on sCT images. Dose distributions were evaluated
comparing voxel-based dose differences, gamma and dose-volume histogram (DVH)
analysis. The sCT generation required 5.6 s and 21 s for a single patient

results will then be used to predict the mechanical equilibria of suspended
fluid enclosures (generically referred to as 'droplets') in a bulk with active
particles being present either inside the bulk fluid or within the suspended
droplets. We show that, while droplets containing active particles and
suspended in a normal bulk behave in accordance with standard capillary
paradigms, those containing a normal fluid exhibit anomalous behaviors when
suspended in an active bulk. In the latter case, the excess swim pressure
results in non-monotonic dependence of the inside droplet pressure on the
droplet radius. As a result, we find a regime of anomalous capillarity for a
single droplet, where the inside droplet pressure increases upon increasing the
droplet size. In the case of two interconnected droplets, we show that
mechanical equilibrium can occur also when they have different sizes. We
further identify a regime of anomalous ripening, where two unequal-sized
droplets can reach a final state of equal sizes upon interconnection, in stark
contrast with the standard Ostwald ripening phenomenon, implying shrinkage of
the smaller droplet in favor of the larger one.

a focusing matrix nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation which models condensates in
the case of attractive mean field interactions and ferromagnetic spin-exchange
interactions. In particular, we show that, when no background is present, all
one-soliton solutions are reducible via unitary transformations to a

BECs. On the other hand, we show that, when a non-zero background is present,
not all matrix one-soliton solutions are reducible to a simple combination of
scalar solutions. We show that some solitons are topological ones and others
are dark-bright solitons. Finally, by taking suitable limits of all the
solutions on a non-zero background we also obtain three families of rogue-wave
(i.e., rational) solutions, two of which are novel to the best of our

different risks and risk factors are also identified. Extensive experimental

a minimization problem for the $H^2$ norm of the difference between the
transfer functions of the original and new agent systems, under the assumption
that the leader agents to be demoted are fixed. The leader demotion problem is
that of finding optimal leader agents to be demoted, and is formulated using
the global optimal solution to the leader selection problem. We prove that a
global optimal solution to the leader selection problem is the set of the
original leader agents except for those that are demoted to followers. To this
end, we relax the original problem into a differentiable problem. Then, by
calculating the gradient and Hessian of the objective function of the relaxed

which is a finite combinatorial optimization problem. Furthermore, we prove
that any set of leader agents to be demoted subject to a fixed number of

choose new leader agents from the original ones except for those specified by
the set of leader agents to be demoted, then the relative $H^2$ error between
the transfer functions of the original and new agent systems is completely
determined by the numbers of original leader agents and leader agents that are
demoted to follower agents. That is, we reveal that the relative $H^2$ error
does not depend on the number of agents on the graph. Finally, we verify the
solutions using a simple example.

many different implementations and applications. A lot of language
specifications have been defined in order-sorted algebra frameworks such as the
language specifications in K (an order-sorted algebra framework). The biggest
problem in a lot of the order-sorted algebra frameworks is that even if they
might allow developers to write programs and language specifications easily,
but they do not have a large set of tools to provide reasoning infrastructures
to reason about the specifications built on the frameworks, which are very
common in some many-sorted algebra framework such as Isabelle/HOL, Coq and FDR.
This fact brings us the necessity to marry the worlds of order-sorted algebras
and many sorted algebras. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to translate a
strictly sensible order-sorted algebra to a many-sorted one in a restricted
domain by requiring the order-sorted algebra to be strictly sensible. The key
idea of the translation is to add an equivalence relation called core equality
to the translated many-sorted algebras. By defining this relation, we reduce
the complexity of translating a strictly sensible order-sorted algebra to a
many-sorted one, make the translated many-sorted algebra equations only
increasing by a very small amount of new equations, and keep the number of
rewrite rules in the algebra in the same amount. We then prove the order-sorted
algebra and its translated many-sorted algebra are bisimilar. To the best of
our knowledge, our translation and bisimilar proof is the first attempt in
translating and relating an order-sorted algebra with a many-sorted one in a
way that keeps the size of the translated many-sorted algebra relatively small.

spaces are, however, infinite in general. Thus, we propose some conditions for
equivalence relations to preserve the result of the membership problem, then we
identify two vertices as the same under the relation. In this sense, dependency
spaces possibly result in a finite graph. We show some examples having infinite
dependency spaces which are reducible to finite graphs by equivalence

show the soundness of the procedure. We also implement the procedure using an

recommender system as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and leverage
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to automatically learn the optimal strategies via
recommending trial-and-error items and receiving reinforcements of these items
from users' feedback. Users' feedback can be positive and negative and both
types of feedback have great potentials to boost recommendations. However, the
number of negative feedback is much larger than that of positive one; thus
incorporating them simultaneously is challenging since positive feedback could
be buried by negative one. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to
incorporate them into the proposed deep recommender system (DEERS) framework.
The experimental results based on real-world e-commerce data demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework. Further experiments have been

have brought opportunities for studying composite quantum systems with
different spin-statistics. The binary atomic mixtures can exhibit a structural
transition from a mixture into phase separation as the boson-fermion
interaction increases. By using a path-integral formalism to evaluate the grand
partition function and thermodynamic grand potential, we obtain the effective
potential of binary Bose-Fermi mixtures. Thermodynamic quantities in a broad
range of temperatures and interactions are also derived. The structural
transition can be identified as a loop of the effective potential curve, and
the volume fraction of phase separation can be determined by the lever rule.
For $^6$Li-$^7$Li and $^6$Li-$^{41}$K mixtures, we present the phase diagrams
of the mixtures in a box potential at zero and finite temperatures. Due to the
flexible densities of atomic gases, the construction of phase separation is
more complicated when compared to conventional liquid or solid mixtures where
the individual densities are fixed. For harmonically trapped mixtures, we use
the local density approximation to map out the finite-temperature density
profiles and present typical trap structures, including the mixture, partially

set has a proper c-coloring. In this paper, we study the problem of finding a
step-by-step transformation (reconfiguration) between two c-colorable sets in
the same graph. This problem generalizes the well-studied Independent Set
Reconfiguration problem. As the first step toward a systematic understanding of
the complexity of this general problem, we study the problem on classes of
perfect graphs. We first focus on interval graphs and give a combinatorial
characterization of the distance between two c-colorable sets. This gives a
linear-time algorithm for finding an actual shortest reconfiguration sequence
for interval graphs. Since interval graphs are exactly the graphs that are
simultaneously chordal and co-comparability, we then complement the positive
result by showing that even deciding reachability is PSPACE-complete for
chordal graphs and for co-comparability graphs. The hardness for chordal graphs
holds even for split graphs. We also consider the case where c is a fixed
constant and show that in such a case the reachability problem is
polynomial-time solvable for split graphs but still PSPACE-complete for
co-comparability graphs. The complexity of this case for chordal graphs remains
unsettled. As by-products, our positive results give the first polynomial-time
solvable cases (split graphs and interval graphs) for Feedback Vertex Set

modulation design for SWIPT has however been scarcely addressed. In this paper,
a modulation scheme based on asymmetric phase-shift keying (PSK) is considered,
which improves the SWIPT rate-energy tradeoff region significantly. The
nonlinear rectifier model, which accurately models the energy harvester, is
adopted for evaluating the output direct current (DC) power at the receiver.
The harvested DC power is maximized under an average power constraint at the
transmitter and a constraint on the rate of information transmitted via a
multi-carrier signal over a flat fading channel. As a consequence of the
rectifier nonlinearity, this work highlights that asymmetric PSK modulation
provides benefits over conventional symmetric PSK modulation in SWIPT and opens
the door to systematic modulation design tailored for SWIPT.

individually convex for a fixed receiver filter while optimizing the waveform,

optimization, and are referred to biconvex programs. Alternating minimization
(AM) is perhaps the most popu- lar, effective, and simplest algorithm that can
deal with bi-convexity. In this paper we consider new perspectives on this
problem via older, well established problems in the optimization literature. It
is shown here specifically that the radar waveform optimization may be cast as
constrained least squares, semi-definite programs (SDP), and quadratically
constrained quadratic programs (QCQP). The bi-convex constraint introduces sets
which vary for each iteration in the alternat- ing minimization. We prove
convergence of alternating minimization for biconvex problems with biconvex
constraints by showing the equivalence of this to a biconvex problem with
constrained Cartesian product convex sets but for convex hulls of small

change exerts a force on the wall which plays the role of boundary of the

developed to model the neurodegenerative diseases, associating biomarkers,
especially non-intrusive neuroimaging markers, with key clinical scores
measuring the cognitive status of patients. Multi-task learning (MTL) has been
commonly utilized by these studies to address high dimensionality and small
cohort size challenges. However, most existing MTL approaches are based on
linear models and suffer from two major limitations: 1) they cannot explicitly
consider upper/lower bounds in these clinical scores; 2) they lack the
capability to capture complicated non-linear interactions among the variables.
In this paper, we propose Subspace Network, an efficient deep modeling approach
for non-linear multi-task censored regression. Each layer of the subspace
network performs a multi-task censored regression to improve upon the
predictions from the last layer via sketching a low-dimensional subspace to
perform knowledge transfer among learning tasks. Under mild assumptions, for
each layer the parametric subspace can be recovered using only one pass of
training data. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed subspace network
quickly picks up the correct parameter subspaces, and outperforms
state-of-the-arts in predicting neurodegenerative clinical scores using

framework differs from classical Bayesian optimal design of experiments (ODE)
in the following sense: we seek experimental designs that minimize the
posterior uncertainty in the experiment end-goal, e.g., a quantity of interest
(QoI), rather than the estimated parameter itself. This is suitable for
scenarios in which the solution of an inverse problem is an intermediate step
and the estimated parameter is then used to compute a QoI. In such problems, a
GOODE approach has two benefits: the designs can avoid wastage of experimental
resources by a targeted collection of data, and the resulting design criteria
are computationally easier to evaluate due to the often low-dimensionality of
the QoIs. We present two modified design criteria, A-GOODE and D-GOODE, which
are natural analogues of classical Bayesian A- and D-optimal criteria. We
analyze the connections to other ODE criteria, and provide interpretations for
the GOODE criteria by using tools from information theory. Then, we develop an
efficient gradient-based optimization framework for solving the GOODE
optimization problems. Additionally, we present comprehensive numerical
experiments testing the various aspects of the presented approach. The driving
application is the optimal placement of sensors to identify the source of

the quantum fluctuation energy scale ($\omega$) as one of its axes. A relation

Due to
its long-period orbit, this system is an interesting target to test the
adiabatic wind shock model. The goal is to improve our knowledge of the orbital
and stellar parameters of HD54662 and to analyze its X-ray emission to test the
theoretical scaling of the X-ray emission with orbital separation for adiabatic
wind shocks. We applied a spectral disentangling code to optical spectra to
determine the radial velocities and the individual spectra of each star. The
individual spectra were analyzed using the CMFGEN model atmosphere code. We
fitted two X-ray spectra using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm and
compared them to the emission expected from adiabatic shocks. We determine an
orbital period of 2103.4days, a low orbital eccentricity of 0.11, and a mass
ratio m2/m1=0.84. Combined with the orbital inclination inferred in a previous
astrometric study, we obtain surprisingly low masses of 9.7 and 8.2Msun. From
the individual spectra, we infer O6.5 spectral types for both stars and a
brightness ratio of l1/l2~2. The softness of the X-ray spectra, the very small
variation of spectral parameters, and the comparison of the X-ray-to-bolometric
luminosity ratio with the canonical value for O-type stars allow us to conclude
that X-ray emission from the wind interaction region is quite low. We cannot
confirm the runaway status previously attributed to HD54662 and we find no
X-ray emission associated with the bow shock detected in the infrared. The lack
of hard X-ray emission from the wind-shock region suggests that the mass-loss
rates are lower than expected and/or that the pre-shock wind velocities are
much lower than the terminal wind velocities. The bow shock associated with
HD54662 possibly corresponds to a wind-blown arc created by the interaction of
the stellar winds with the ionized gas of CMa OB1. (abridged)

underlying the appearance of a chiral response is very different in all these
methods, the enantio-sensitive and dichroic observable in all cases has a
unique form. It is a polar vector given by the product of (i) a molecular
pseudoscalar and (ii) a field pseudovector specified by the configuration of
the electric fields interacting with the isotropic ensemble of chiral
molecules. The molecular pseudoscalar is a rotationally invariant property,
which is composed from different molecule-specific vectors and in the simplest
case is a triple product of such vectors. The key property that enables the
chiral response is the non-coplanarity of the vectors forming such triple
product. The key property that enables chiral detection without relying on the
chirality of the electromagnetic fields is the vectorial nature of the
enantio-sensitive observable. Our compact and general expression for this
observable shows what ultimately determines the efficiency of the chiral signal
and if, or when, it can reach 100%. We also discuss the differences between the
two phenomena, which rely on the bound states, PXCD and EMWS, and the two
phenomena using the continuum states, PECD and PXECD. Finally, we extend these
methods to arbitrary polarizations of the electric fields used to induce and

unique features and functionalities. It is generally assumed that life started
from a random pool of oligonucleotides sequences, generated by a prebiotic
polymerization of nucleotides. The mechanism that initially facilitated the
emergence of sequences that code for the function of the first species from
such a random pool of sequences remains unknown. It is a central problem of the
origin of life. An interesting option would be a self-selection mechanism by
spontaneous symmetry breaking. Initial concentration fluctuations of specific
sequence motifs would have been amplified and outcompeted less abundant
sequences, enhancing the signal to noise to replicate and select functional
sequences. Here, we demonstrate with experimental and theoretical findings that
templated ligation would provide such a self-selection. In templated ligation,
two adjacent single sequences strands are chemically joined when a third
complementary strand sequence brought them in close proximity. This simple
mechanism was a likely side-product of a prebiotic polymerization chemistry
once the strands reach the length to form double stranded species. As shown
here, the ligation gave rise to a nonlinear replication process by the
cooperative ligation of matching sequences which self-promoted their own
elongation. This led to a cascade of enhanced template binding and faster
ligation reactions. A requirement was the reshuffling of the strands by thermal
cycling, enabled for example by microscale convection. Assuming that templated
ligation was driven by the same chemical mechanism that generated prebiotic
polymerization of oligonucleotides, the mechanism could function as a missing
link between polymerization and the self-stabilized replication, offering a
pathway to the autonomous emergence of Darwinian evolution for the origin of
life.

(Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker) cosmological spacetimes, or small
perturbations thereof. However, the abstract notion of luminosity distance is
actually much more robust than this, and can be defined non-perturbatively in
almost arbitrary spacetimes. Some quite general results are already known, in
terms of $dA_\mathrm{observer}/d\Omega_\mathrm{source}$, the cross-sectional
area per unit solid angle of a null geodesic spray emitted from some source and
subsequently detected by some observer. We shall reformulate these results in
terms of a suitably normalized null geodesic affine parameter and the van Vleck
determinant, $\Delta_{vV}$. The contribution due to the null geodesic affine
parameter is effectively the inverse square law for luminosity, and the van
Vleck determinant can be viewed as providing a measure of deviations from the
inverse square law. This formulation is closely related to the so-called Jacobi
determinant, but the van Vleck determinant has somewhat nicer analytic
properties and wider and deeper theoretical base in the general relativity,
quantum physics, and quantum field theory communities. In the current article
we shall concentrate on non-perturbative results, leaving near-FLRW
perturbative investigation for future work.

arriving jobs to resources is often regulated by a dispatcher, also known as
load balancer. A fundamental problem consists in designing a load balancing
algorithm that minimizes the delays experienced by jobs. During the last two
decades, the power-of-$d$-choice algorithm, based on the idea of dispatching
each job to the least loaded server out of $d$ servers randomly sampled at the
arrival of the job itself, has emerged as a breakthrough in the foundations of
this area due to its versatility and appealing asymptotic properties. In this
paper, we consider the power-of-$d$-choice algorithm with the addition of a
local memory that keeps track of the latest observations collected over time on
the sampled servers. Then, each job is sent to a server with the lowest
observation. We show that this algorithm is asymptotically optimal in the sense
that the load balancer can always assign each job to an idle server in the
large-system limit. This holds true if and only if the system load $\lambda$ is
less than $1-\frac{1}{d}$. If this condition is not satisfied, we show that
queue lengths are tightly bounded by $\left\lceil - \frac{ \log
(1-\lambda)}{\log (\lambda d +1)} \right\rceil$. This is in contrast with the
classic version of the power-of-$d$-choice algorithm, where at the fluid scale
a strictly positive proportion of servers containing $i$ jobs exists for all
$i\ge 0$, in equilibrium. Our results quantify and highlight the importance of
using memory as a means to enhance performance in randomized load balancing.

In this case, the orthogonality of the eigenvectors of the total (Hermitian)
system must be sustained, despite the eigenvectors of the subsystem
(non-Hermitian) satisfy the bi-orthogonal condition. Therefore, one can predict
that there must exist some remarkable processes that relate the non-Hermitian
subsystem and the rest part, and ultimately preserve the Hermiticity of the
total system. In this paper, we study such processes in open elliptical
microcavities. The inner part of the cavity is a non-Hermitian system, and the
outer part is the coupled bath in FPO formalism. We investigate the correlation
between the inner- and the outer-part behaviors associated with the avoided
resonance crossings (ARCs), and analyze the results in terms of a trade-off
between the relative difference of self-energies and collective Lamb shifts.
These results come from the conservation of the orthogonality in the total
Hermitian quantum system.

on product rating websites for making purchase decisions. The reliability of
online ratings, however, is potentially compromised by the so-called herding
effect: when rating a product, customers may be biased to follow other
customers' previous ratings of the same product. This is problematic because it
skews long-term customer perception through haphazard early ratings. The study
of herding poses methodological challenges. In particular, observational
studies are impeded by the lack of counterfactuals: simply correlating early
with subsequent ratings is insufficient because we cannot know what the
subsequent ratings would have looked like had the first ratings been different.
The methodology introduced here exploits a setting that comes close to an
experiment, although it is purely observational---a natural experiment. Our key
methodological device consists in studying the same product on two separate
rating sites, focusing on products that received a high first rating on one
site, and a low first rating on the other. This largely controls for confounds
such as a product's inherent quality, advertising, and producer identity, and
lets us isolate the effect of the first rating on subsequent ratings. In a case
study, we focus on beers as products and jointly study two beer rating sites,
but our method applies to any pair of sites across which products can be
matched. We find clear evidence of herding in beer ratings. For instance, if a
beer receives a very high first rating, its second rating is on average half a
standard deviation higher, compared to a situation where the identical beer
receives a very low first rating. Moreover, herding effects tend to last a long
time and are noticeable even after 20 or more ratings. Our results have
important implications for the design of better rating systems.

parts of Air Traffic Management (ATM). The goal of ATFCM is to make airport and
airspace capacity meet traffic demand and, when capacity opportunities are
exhausted, optimise traffic flows to meet the available capacity. One of the
key enablers of ATFCM is the accurate estimation of future traffic demand. The
available information (schedules, flight plans, etc.) and its associated level
of uncertainty differ across the different ATFCM planning phases, leading to
qualitative differences between the types of forecasting that are feasible at
each time horizon. While abundant research has been conducted on tactical
trajectory prediction (i.e., during the day of operations), trajectory
prediction in the pre-tactical phase, when few or no flight plans are
available, has received much less attention. As a consequence, the methods
currently in use for pre-tactical traffic forecast are still rather
rudimentary, often resulting in suboptimal ATFCM decision making. This paper
proposes a machine learning approach for the prediction of airlines route
choices between two airports as a function of route characteristics, such as
flight efficiency, air navigation charges and expected level of congestion.
Different predictive models based on multinomial logistic regression and
decision trees are formulated and calibrated with historical traffic data, and
a critical evaluation of each model is conducted. We analyse the predictive
power of each model in terms of its ability to forecast traffic volumes at the
level of charging zones, proving significant potential to enhance pre-tactical
traffic forecast. We conclude by discussing the limitations and room for
improvement of the proposed approach, as well as the future developments
required to produce reliable traffic forecasts at a higher spatial and temporal
resolution.

angular spectrum with unprecedented accuracy, and these results are likely to
remain the state-of-the art for a decade or more. Since these measurements are
going to be used to forecast Euclid's ability to test alternative dark matter
models, we aim to set the final CMB constraint on the cross section of dark
matter-photon scattering in the early universe. As the formalism has not been
published in the literature yet, we present the key steps to derive the full
set of linearized Einstein and Boltzmann equations and elucidate necessary
modifications to the line of sight and the tight coupling approximation. These
approximation schemes are commonly used in Boltzmann codes to reduce
computational costs, but the tight coupling regime has been neglected in
previous works related to dark matter-photon interactions. Our computations
account for a dark matter sound speed, which was neglected in previous work. We
find that its effect is negligible on the CMB spectra but fairly important on
the linear matter power spectrum. We then analyze the Planck data, with and
without the 2015 polarization data at high multipoles. In both cases our
constraint on the ratio of the elastic scattering cross section to the dark
matter mass becomes more stringent with respect to previous constraints. The
change is about 35\% when the full Planck dataset is added (which includes
E-mode polarization at high multipoles and the lensing potential power
spectrum) and about 20\%. when we only account for the polarization data at low
multipoles and the full temperature spectrum. Our most conservative limit reads

forecasting service StormFocus during 2011--2016. The service was implemented
in 2011 at SpaceWeather.Ru and predicts the expected strength of geomagnetic
storms as measured by $Dst$ index several hours ahead. The forecast is based on
L1 solar wind and IMF measurements and is updated every hour. The solar maximum
of cycle 24 is weak, so most of the statistics are on rather moderate storms.
We verify quality of selection criteria, as well as reliability of real-time
input data in comparison with the final values, available in archives. In
real-time operation 87% of storms were correctly predicted while the reanalysis
running on final OMNI data predicts successfully 97% of storms. Thus the main
reasons for prediction errors are discrepancies between real-time and final
data (Dst, solar wind and IMF) due to processing errors, specifics of datasets.

the question of whether it is appropriate to process the inputs in combination,
as if they originated from the same event, or separately, as if they originated
from distinct events. Furthermore, it must also have a mechanism through which
it can keep sensory inputs calibrated to maintain the accuracy of its internal
representations. We have developed a neural network architecture capable of i)
approximating optimal multisensory spatial integration, based on Bayesian
causal inference, and ii) recalibrating the spatial encoding of sensory
systems. The architecture is based on features of the dorsal processing
hierarchy, including the spatial tuning properties of unisensory neurons and
the convergence of different sensory inputs onto multisensory neurons.
Furthermore, we propose that these unisensory and multisensory neurons play
dual roles in i) encoding spatial location as separate or integrated estimates
and ii) accumulating evidence for the independence or relatedness of
multisensory stimuli. We further propose that top-down feedback connections
spanning the dorsal pathway play key a role in recalibrating spatial encoding
at the level of early unisensory cortices. Our proposed architecture provides
possible explanations for a number of human electrophysiological and
neuroimaging results and generates testable predictions linking neurophysiology
with behaviour.

valence electrons, these correlated electron pairs can form a metastable energy
band above the corresponding single-electron band separated by an energy gap.
In order to determine if these metastable electron pairs can be stabilized, we
calculate the many-electron exchange-correlation renormalization and the
polaron correction to the two-band system with single electrons and electron
pairs. We find that the electron-phonon interaction is essential to
counterbalance the Coulomb repulsion and to stabilize the electron pairs. The
interplay of the electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions, manifested
in the exchange-correlation energies, polaron effects, and screening, is
responsible for the formation of electron pairs (bipolarons) that are located

various problems in modern physics. This includes theoretical as well as
phenomenological aspects, such as the unification of the fundamental
interactions or the hierarchy problem. Based on the seminal works by Kaluza and
Klein that were published nearly 100 years ago, we denote theories with at
least one compact periodic dimension as Kaluza-Klein theories. From a
gravitational point of view the question arises, what are the fundamental
solutions to Einstein's field equations of general relativity under these
assumptions. In particular, in this work we are concerned with black hole
solutions in Kaluza-Klein theory. Considering only the static case without
electric charge, it turns out that there is a much richer phase space than in
the usual four-dimensional theory, where only the Schwarzschild solution
exists. There are at least two types of solutions with a completely different
horizon topology: localized black holes with an ordinary spherical horizon and
black strings with a horizon that wraps the compact dimension. Several
arguments favor the conjecture that the solution branches of both types are
connected via a singular topology changing solution that is controlled by the
so-called double-cone metric. We study the regime close to this singular
transit solution in five and six spacetime dimensions with the help of a highly
accurate numerical scheme that we describe in detail. Consequently, for the
first time we are able to show that in this regime the black objects exhibit a
critical behavior, indicating that physical quantities are governed by
universal critical exponents. Such exponents were already derived from the
double-cone metric. We show that our data confirms these values extremely well.
This provides compelling evidence in favor of the double-cone metric as the
local model of the transit solution.

conductivities of the same sign. However, there is a critical value of the

concentrate on the hidden superalgebras underlying $D=11$ and $D=7$
supergravities, exploring the symmetries hidden in the theories and the
physical role of the nilpotent fermionic generators naturally appearing in the
aforementioned superalgebras. After that, we move to the pure algebraic and

proving the equivalence of describing the systems through the transfer matrix
formalism and a Fokker-Planck equation for a distribution evolving in space.
The Fokker-Planck equation is known to be equivalent to a stochastic
differential (It\={o}) equation. The latter is very suitable for computer
simulations, allowing the calculation of any desired correlation function. As
an illustration, we apply our method to the case of two tunnel-coupled
quasi-condensates of bosonic atoms. The results are compared to the predictions
of the sine-Gordon model for which we develop analytic expressions directly

planet-disc interactions and gravitational instability (GI) most prominently.
Though they have been examined thoroughly in two-dimensional simulations, their
vertical structures in the non-linear regime are somewhat unexplored. This
neglect is unwarranted given that any strong vertical motions associated with
these waves could profoundly impact dust dynamics, dust sedimentation, planet
formation, and the emissivity of the disc surface. In this paper we combine
linear calculations and shearing box simulations in order to investigate the
vertical structure of spiral waves for various polytropic stratifications and
wave amplitudes. For sub-adiabatic profiles we find that spiral waves develop a
pair of counter-rotating poloidal rolls. Particularly strong in the nonlinear
regime, these vortical structures issue from the baroclinicity supported by the
background vertical entropy gradient. They are also intimately connected to the
disk's g-modes which appear to interact nonlinearly with the density waves.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the poloidal rolls are ubiquitous in
gravitoturbulence, emerging in the vicinity of GI spiral wakes, and potentially
transporting grains off the disk midplane. Other than hindering sedimentation
and planet formation, this phenomena may bear on observations of the disk's
scattered infrared luminosity. The vortical features could also impact on the
turbulent dynamo operating in young protoplanetary discs subject to GI, or
possibly even galactic discs.

recurrence classification is known, but we prove new results on existence and
non-existence of moments of return times. If $\mu_i (x) \to d_i$ for $d_i \neq

lensing, using a suite of high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations, Evolution
and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) project. We introduce
the simulation and analysis pipeline and present the first set of results from
our analysis of early-type galaxies. We identify and extract an ensemble of
simulated lens galaxies and use the GLAMER ray-tracing lensing code to create
mock lenses similar to those observed in the SLACS and SL2S surveys, using a
range of source parameters and galaxy orientations, including observational
effects such as the Point-Spread-Function (PSF), pixelization and noise levels,
representative of single-orbit observations with the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) using the ACS-F814W filter. We subsequently model these mock lenses using
the code LENSED, treating them in the same way as observed lenses. We also
estimate the mass model parameters directly from the projected surface mass
density of the simulated galaxy, using an identical mass model family. We
perform a three-way comparison of all the measured quantities with real lenses.
We find the average total density slope of EAGLE lenses, $t=2.26\; (0.25\;
\rm{rms})$ to be higher than SL2S, $t=2.16$ or SLACS, $t=2.08$. We find a very
strong correlation between the external shear ($\gamma$) and the complex
ellipticity ($\epsilon$), with $\gamma \sim \epsilon/4$. This correlation
indicates a degeneracy in the lens mass modeling. We also see a dispersion
between lens modeling and direct fitting results, indicating systematical
biases.

Such structure features two plasmon dipole modes, associated with electronic

inner plasmon leads to switching between this state and a Fano resonance (Fano
switching). Once the external light intensity exceeds the critical value, the
bistability zones of both eigen modes overlap yielding optical tristability

nitride-based MXenes. More importantly, nearly free electron states are
observed to exist outside the surfaces of -OH functionalized carbide/nitride
based MXenes, especially in Tin+1Nn(OH)2, which provide almost perfect
transmission channels without nuclear scattering for electron transport. The
overall electrical conductivity of nitride-based MXenes is determined to be
higher than that of carbide-based MXenes. The exceptional properties of
titanium nitride-based MXenes, including strong surface adsorption, high
elastic constant and Young's modulus, and good metallic conductivity, make them
promising materials for catalysis and energy storage applications.

algorithm, however, each transmitter must know an estimate of the gradient
matrix of the local utility. The knowledge of the gradient matrix at the
transmitters incurs a high signaling overhead especially that the matrix size
increases with the dimension of the action matrix. In this paper, we therefore
investigate two strategies in order to decrease the informational exchange per
iteration of the algorithm. In the first strategy, each receiver sends at each
iteration part of the elements of the gradient matrix with respect to a certain
probability. In the second strategy, each receiver feeds back sporadically the
whole gradient matrix. We focus on the analysis of the convergence of the MXL
algorithm to optimum under these two strategies. We prove that the algorithm
can still converge to optimum almost surely. Upper bounds of the average
convergence rate are also derived in both situations with general step-size

Galactic globular clusters is not generally found in other systems like dwarf
galaxies and open clusters, and at the moment no model can fully explain its

the variation of its extent in the space of cluster mass, age, metallicity, and
compactness has proven to be a fruitful line of investigation. In the framework
of a larger project to search for multiple population in open clusters, based
on literature and survey data, I found peculiar chemical abundance patterns in
a sample of intermediate age open clusters with publicly available data. More
specifically, fast rotating dwarf stars (v sini > 50km/s) belonging to four
clusters display a bimodality in either [Na/Fe], [O/Fe] or both. Additionally,
two clusters show a Na-O anticorrelation in the fast rotating stars and one
cluster shows a large [Mg/Fe] variation among the stars with high [Na/Fe],
reaching the extreme Mg depletion observed in NGC 2808. Even considering that
the sample sizes are small, these patterns call for attention in the light of a
possible connection with the multiple population phenomenon of globular
clusters. The specific chemistry observed in these fast rotating dwarf stars is
thought to be produced by a complex interplay of different diffusion and mixing
mechanisms, like rotational mixing and mass loss, in turn influenced by
metallicity, binarity, mass, age, variability, and so on. However, with the
sample in hand, it was not possible to identify which stellar parameters cause
the observed Na and O bimodality and Na-O anticorrelation, suggesting that
other stellar properties might be important besides stellar rotation.

joint knowledge of a star's physical parameters, detailed element abundances,
and precise age. For cool main-sequence (MS) stars the abundances of many
elements can be measured from spectroscopy, but ages are very hard to
determine. The situation is different if the MS star has a white dwarf (WD)
companion and a known distance, as the age of such a binary system can then be
determined precisely from the photometric properties of the cooling WD. As a
pilot study for obtaining precise age determinations of field MS stars, we
identify nearly one hundred candidates for such wide binary systems: a faint WD
whose GPS1 proper motion matches that of a brighter MS star in Gaia/TGAS with a
good parallax ($\sigma_\varpi/\varpi\le 0.05$). We model the WD's multi-band
photometry with the BASE-9 code using this precise distance (assumed to be
common for the pair) and infer ages for each binary system. The resulting age
estimates are precise to $\le 10\%$ ($\le 20\%$) for $42$ ($67$) MS-WD systems.
Our analysis more than doubles the number of MS-WD systems with precise
distances known to date, and it boosts the number of such systems with precise
age determination by an order of magnitude. With the advent of the Gaia DR2
data, this approach will be applicable to a far larger sample, providing ages
for many MS stars (that can yield detailed abundances for over 20 elements),
especially in the age range 2 to 8\,\Gyr, where there are only few known star
clusters.

large enough to induce convergence of the estimator. Furthermore, we show under

exhibit arbitrary patterns as a function of K. Second, we establish that the
K-MD estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal for all K. For a
specific weight matrix, the K-MD estimator has the same asymptotic distribution
as the K-PML estimator. Our main result provides an optimal sequence of weight

result is especially unexpected given the findings in Aguirregabiria and Mira

In other words, additional policy iterations do not provide asymptotic

transmission at millimeter waves. To implement it in a transceiver, many
references optimally adapt to a high-dimensional multi-antenna channel but more
or less ignore the complexity of the channel estimation. Realizing that
received coupling coefficients of the channel and pairs of possible analog
beamforming vectors can be used for analog beam selection, we further propose a
low-complexity scheme that exploits the coupling coefficients to implement
hybrid beamforming. Essentially, the coupling coefficients can be regarded as
implicit channel state information (CSI), and the estimates of these coupling
coefficients yield alternatives of effective channel matrices of much lower
dimension. After calculating the Frobenius norm of these effective channel
matrices, it turns out that the effective channel having the largest value of
the Frobenius norm provides the solution to hybrid beamforming problem.

the anticanonical class of a (smooth) projective toric variety is the sum of
invariant prime divisors, corresponding to the rays in its fan (or facets in

To this end, we suggest an analogue of the notion of anticanonical class (of a
compact complex manifold) for linear families of convex polytopes. This is
inspired by the Serre duality for smooth projective varieties as well as the
Ehrhart-Macdonald reciprocity for rational polytopes. The main examples we have

machine learning and combinatorial optimization to computational physics and
biology. A central class of sampling algorithms is the \emph{Markov Chain Monte
Carlo} method, based on the construction of a Markov chain with the desired
sampling distribution as its stationary distribution. Many of the traditional
Markov chains, such as the \emph{Glauber dynamics}, do not scale well with
increasing dimension. To address this shortcoming, we propose a simple local
update rule based on the Glauber dynamics that leads to efficient parallel and
distributed algorithms for sampling from Gibbs distributions.
  Concretely, we present a Markov chain that mixes in $O(\log n)$ rounds when
Dobrushin's condition for the Gibbs distribution is satisfied. This improves
over the \emph{LubyGlauber} algorithm by Feng, Sun, and Yin [PODC'17], which
needs $O(\Delta \log n)$ rounds, and their \emph{LocalMetropolis} algorithm,
which converges in $O(\log n)$ rounds but requires a considerably stronger
mixing condition. Here, $n$ denotes the number of nodes in the graphical model
inducing the Gibbs distribution, and $\Delta$ its maximum degree. In
particular, our method can sample a uniform proper coloring with $\alpha
\Delta$ colors in $O(\log n)$ rounds for any $\alpha>2$, which almost matches
the threshold of the sequential Glauber dynamics and improves on the $\alpha>2

on the scale length of the particle diameter are not in agreement with the
prediction that the spatial variation in MSD should mimic the spatial variation
in density. The predicted behavior is derived from the expectation that the MSD
of a particle depends on the system density and the assumption that the force
acting on a particle is a point function of position. The experimental data
come from studies of the MSDs of particles in narrow ribbon channels and
between narrowly spaced parallel plates, and from new data, reported herein, of
the radial and azimuthal MSDs of a colloid particle in a dense colloid
suspension confined to a small circular cavity. In each of these geometries a
dense colloid suspension exhibits pronounced density oscillations with spacing
of a particle diameter. We remove the discrepancy between prediction and
experiment using the Fisher-Methfessel interpretation of how local equilibrium
in an inhomogeneous system is maintained to argue that the force acting on a
particle is delocalized over a volume with radius equal to a particle diameter.
Our interpretation has relevance to the relationship between the scale of
inhomogeneity and the utility of translation of the particle MSD into a
position dependent diffusion coefficient, and to the use of a spatially
dependent diffusion coefficient to describe mass transport in a heterogeneous
system.

the Galactic disk during the last 5 Gyrs. Due to the spatial extent of the
MWSC, we consider spatial variations of the age distribution along
galactocentric radius $R_G$, and along $Z$-axis. For the analysis of the age
distribution we use 2242 clusters, which all lie within roughly 2.5 kpc of the
Sun. To connect the observed age distribution to the cluster formation history
we build an analytical model based on simple assumptions on the cluster initial
mass function and on the cluster mass-lifetime relation, fit it to the
observations, and determine the parameters of the cluster formation law.
Comparison with the literature shows that earlier results strongly
underestimated the number of evolved clusters with ages $t\gtrsim 100$ Myr.
Recent studies based on all-sky catalogues agree better with our data, but
still lack the oldest clusters with ages $t\gtrsim 1$ Gyr. We do not observe a
strong variation in the age distribution along $R_G$, though we find an
enhanced fraction of older clusters ($t>1$ Gyr) in the inner disk. In contrast,
the distribution strongly varies along $Z$. The high altitude distribution
practically does not contain clusters with $t<1$ Gyr. With simple assumptions
on the cluster formation history, cluster initial mass function and cluster
lifetime we can reproduce the observations. Cluster formation rate and cluster
lifetime are strongly degenerate, which does not allow us to disentangle
different formation scenarios. In all cases the cluster formation rate is
strongly declining with time, and the cluster initial mass function is very
shallow at the high mass end. (abridged)

We find that, by detecting a fast and forward neutron in the final state, an
almost on-shell $\bar{K}$ is guaranteed, which is essential to make a bound
state with two nucleons from ${}^{3} \text{He}$. Then, this almost on-shell
$\bar{K}$ can bring a signal of the $\bar{K} N N$ bound state in the $\Lambda

above the $\bar{K} N N$ threshold as well. As a consequence, we predict two
peaks across the $\bar{K} N N$ threshold in the spectrum: the lower peak coming
from the $\bar{K} N N$ bound state, and the higher one originating from the

plane are considered rare and not conventional sites of star formation.
Contrary to this, the recent discovery of high latitude embedded Clusters can
possibly change our understanding of the Galaxy formation, evolution and
dynamics and the role of the halo in the Galactic evolutionary process. This
article reviews a study of nine embedded clusters (ECs) reported in recent
literature with ages less than 5 Myr and vertical distances from the galactic
disc ranging from 1.8 to 5 kpc. It discusses the processes that could cause
star formation within low density and extraplanar environments in the halo and
discuss the possible origins of these clusters. Are these episodic events or is
star cluster formation a systematic phenomenon in the Galactic halo? Two of
these objects will be observed by us with Astrosat, so we shall comment on the
possible results we expect to get with Astrostat UV and Xray data.

  and Recovery based on LWT and FNN",,,,,"cs.CR cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a novel method for tamper detection and recovery using
semi-fragile data hiding, based on Lifting Wavelet Transform (LWT) and
Feed-Forward Neural Network (FNN). In TRLF, first, the host image is decomposed
up to one level using LWT, and the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is applied
to each 2*2 blocks of diagonal details. Next, a random binary sequence is
embedded in each block as the watermark by correlating $DC$ coefficients. In
authentication stage, first, the watermarked image geometry is reconstructed by
using Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) algorithm and extract watermark bits by
using FNN. Afterward, logical exclusive-or operation between original and
extracted watermark is applied to detect tampered region. Eventually, in the
recovery stage, tampered regions are recovered by image digest which is
generated by inverse halftoning technique. The performance and efficiency of
TRLF and its robustness against various geometric, non-geometric and hybrid
attacks are reported. From the experimental results, it can be seen that TRLF
is superior in terms of robustness and quality of the digest and watermarked
image respectively, compared to the-state-of-the-art fragile and semi-fragile
watermarking methods. In addition, imperceptibility has been improved by using
different correlation steps as the gain factor for flat (smooth) and texture
(rough) blocks.

revealed preferences and the construction of a consistent utility function.
However, modeling agent's choices over preference orderings is not always
practical and demands strong assumptions on human rationality and
data-acquisition abilities. Therefore, we propose a simple generative choice
model where agents are assumed to generate the choice probabilities based on
latent factor matrices that capture their choice evaluation across multiple
attributes. Since the multi-attribute evaluation is typically hidden within the
agent's psyche, we consider a signaling mechanism where agents are provided
with choice information through private signals, so that the agent's choices
provide more insight about his/her latent evaluation across multiple
attributes. We estimate the choice model via a novel multi-stage matrix
factorization algorithm that minimizes the average deviation of the factor
estimates from choice data. Simulation results are presented to validate the
estimation performance of our proposed algorithm.

language for describing individual player actions on the pitch and (2) a
framework for valuing any type of player action based on its impact on the game
outcome while accounting for the context in which the action happened. By
aggregating soccer players' action values, their total offensive and defensive

turbulence strengthens, low power consumption is required for maintenance of
the system performance. Hence the proposed structure is particularly suitable

increase activity by incentivizing a few influential users to take more

Companies such as Uber and Lyft are continuing to grow at a considerable pace
while providing their platform as an organizing medium for ridesharing
services, increasing consumer utility as well as employing thousands in
part-time positions. However, many challenges remain in the modeling of
ridesharing services, many of which are not currently under wide consideration.
In this paper, an agent-based model is developed to simulate a ridesharing
service in the Washington D.C. metropolitan region. The model is used to
examine levels of utility gained for both riders (customers) and drivers
(service providers) of a generic ridesharing service. A description of the
Individual Agent Metro-Washington Area Ridesharing Model (IAMWARM) is provided,
as well as a description of a typical simulation run. We investigate the
financial gains of drivers for a 24-hour period under two scenarios and two
spatial movement behaviors. The two spatial behaviors were random movement and
Voronoi movement, which we describe. Both movement behaviors were tested under
a stationary run conditions scenario and a variable run conditions scenario. We
find that Voronoi movement increased drivers' utility gained but that emergence
of this system property was only viable under variable scenario conditions.
This result provides two important insights: The first is that driver movement
decisions prior to passenger pickup can impact financial gain for the service
and drivers, and consequently, rate of successful pickup for riders. The second
is that this phenomenon is only evident under experimentation conditions where
variability in passenger and driver arrival rates are administered.

discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for the resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
equations on three-dimensional curvilinear unstructured hexahedral meshes.
Compared to other fluid dynamics systems such as the shallow water equations or
the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, the resistive MHD equations need
special considerations because of the divergence-free constraint on the
magnetic field. For instance, it is well known that for the symmetrization of
the ideal MHD system as well as the continuous entropy analysis a
non-conservative term proportional to the divergence of the magnetic field,
typically referred to as the Powell term, must be included. As a consequence,
the mimicry of the continuous entropy analysis in the discrete sense demands a
suitable DG approximation of the non-conservative terms in addition to the
ideal MHD terms.
  This paper focuses on the resistive MHD equations: Our first contribution is
a proof that the resistive terms are symmetric and positive-definite when
formulated in entropy space as gradients of the entropy variables. This enables
us to show that the entropy inequality holds for the resistive MHD equations.
This continuous analysis is the key for our DG discretization and guides the
path for the construction of an approximation that discretely mimics the
entropy inequality, typically termed entropy stability. Our second contribution
is a detailed derivation and analysis of the discretization on
three-dimensional curvilinear meshes. The discrete analysis relies on the
summation-by-parts property, which is satisfied by the DG spectral element
method (DGSEM) with Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) nodes. Although the
divergence-free constraint is included in the non-conservative terms, the
resulting method has no particular treatment of the magnetic field divergence
errors...

important and challenging problem. Standard techniques for this task, including
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), suffer from
inherent drawbacks. Mainly, the Markov assumption implies that, given the
immediate past, future alignment decisions are independent of further history.
The separation between similarity computation and alignment decision also
prevents end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end neural
architecture where alignment actions are implemented as moving data between
stacks of Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) blocks. This flexible architecture
supports a large variety of alignment tasks, including one-to-one, one-to-many,
skipping unmatched elements, and (with extensions) non-monotonic alignment.
Extensive experiments on semi-synthetic and real datasets show that our
algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

spectrum compensation is presented in this paper for noisy speeches in adverse
environments involving non-stationary noise and medium to low levels of SNR.
The magnitude of the noisy speech spectrum is modified in the first step of the
proposed method by a spectral subtraction approach, where a new noise
estimation method based on the low frequency information of the noisy speech is
introduced. We argue that this method of noise estimation is capable of
estimating the non-stationary noise accurately. The phase spectrum of the noisy
speech is modified in the second step consisting of phase spectrum
compensation, where an SNR-dependent approach is incorporated to determine the
amount of compensation to be imposed on the phase spectrum. A modified complex
spectrum is obtained by aggregating the magnitude from the spectral subtraction
step and modified phase spectrum from the phase compensation step, which is
found to be a better representation of enhanced speech spectrum. Speech files
available in the NOIZEUS database are used to carry extensive simulations for
evaluation of the proposed method.

do the similar investigation for the Fej\'er means. Furthermore, we investigate
some N\""orlund means but only in the case when their coefficients are monotone.
Some well-know examples of N\""orlund means are Fej\'er means, Ces\`aro means
and N\""orlund logarithmic means. In addition, we consider Riesz logarithmic
means, which are not example of N\""orlund means. It is also proved that these

  Classification",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is widely conjectured that the reason that training algorithms for neural
networks are successful because all local minima lead to similar performance,
for example, see (LeCun et al., 2015, Choromanska et al., 2015, Dauphin et al.,
2014). Performance is typically measured in terms of two metrics: training
performance and generalization performance. Here we focus on the training
performance of single-layered neural networks for binary classification, and
provide conditions under which the training error is zero at all local minima
of a smooth hinge loss function. Our conditions are roughly in the following
form: the neurons have to be strictly convex and the surrogate loss function
should be a smooth version of hinge loss. We also provide counterexamples to
show that when the loss function is replaced with quadratic loss or logistic
loss, the result may not hold.

  simulations",,,"10.1016/j.pepi.2018.02.001",,"physics.geo-ph astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the nature of the dynamo bifurcation in a configuration
applicable to the Earth's liquid outer core. Numerical studies on the stability
domain of dipolar magnetic fields found a dichotomy between non-reversing
dipole-dominated dynamos and the reversing non-dipole-dominated multipolar
solutions. We show that, by considering weak initial fields, the above
transition disappears and is replaced by a region of bistability. Such a result
was also observed in models with free-slip boundaries in which the geostrophic
zonal flow can develop and participate to the dynamo mechanism for non-dipolar
fields. We show that a similar process develops in no-slip models when viscous
effects are reduced sufficiently.
  The following three regimes are distinguished: (i) Close to the onset of
convection ($Ra_c$) with only the most critical convective mode (wave number)
being present, dynamos set in supercritically and are dipole-dominated. (ii) in
the range $3<Ra/Ra_c<Ra_c$, the bifurcations are subcritical and only
dipole-dominated dynamos exist. (iii) $(Ra/Ra_c>10)$, the relative importance
of zonal flows increases with $Ra$ in non-magnetic models. The field topology
depends on the magnitude of the initial magnetic field. The dipolar branch has
a subcritical behavior whereas the multipolar branch has a supercritical
behavior. By approaching more realistic parameters, the extension of this
bistable regime increases. A hysteretic behavior questions the common
interpretation for geomagnetic reversals.
  Far above the dynamo threshold (by increasing the magnetic Prandtl number),
Lorentz forces contribute to the first order force balance, as predicted for
planetary dynamos. When $Ra$ is sufficiently high, dipolar fields affect
significantly the flow speed, the flow structure and heat transfer which is
reduced by the Lorentz force regardless of the field strength.

accelerating training has received relatively little attention so far. Based on
an in-depth analysis of the key computational patterns in state-of-the-art
gradient-based training methods, we propose an efficient near-memory
acceleration engine called NTX that can be used to train state-of-the-art deep
convolutional neural networks at scale. Our main contributions are: (i) a loose
coupling of RISC-V cores and NTX co-processors reducing offloading overhead by
7x over previously published results; (ii) an optimized IEEE754 compliant data
path for fast high-precision convolutions and gradient propagation; (iii)
evaluation of near-memory computing with NTX embedded into residual area on the
Logic Base die of a Hybrid Memory Cube; and (iv) a scaling analysis to meshes
of HMCs in a data center scenario. We demonstrate a 2.7x energy efficiency
improvement of NTX over contemporary GPUs at 4.4x less silicon area, and a
compute performance of 1.2 Tflop/s for training large state-of-the-art networks
with full floating-point precision. At the data center scale, a mesh of NTX
achieves above 95% parallel and energy efficiency, while providing 2.1x energy
savings or 3.1x performance improvement over a GPU-based system.

who select and then implement actions in the system. The system has an operator
with a centralized objective. The agents, on the other hand, are selfinterested
and strategic in the sense that each agent optimizes its own individual
objective. The operator aims to mitigate this misalignment by designing an
incentive scheme for the agents. The problem is difficult due to the cost
functions of the agents being coupled, the objective of the operator not being
social welfare, and the operator having no direct control over actions being
implemented by the agents. This problem has been studied in many fields,
particularly in mechanism design and cost allocation. However, mechanism design
typically assumes that the operator has knowledge of the cost functions of the
agents and the actions being implemented by the operator. On the other hand,
cost allocation classically assumes that agents do not anticipate the effect of
their actions on the incentive that they obtain. We remove these assumptions
and present an incentive rule for this setup by bridging the gap between
mechanism design and classical cost allocation. We analyze whether the proposed
design satisfies various desirable properties such as social optimality, budget
balance, participation constraint, and so on. We also analyze which of these
properties can be satisfied if the assumptions of cost functions of the agents
being private and the agents being anticipatory are relaxed.
