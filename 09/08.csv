recommended at its recent meeting in Vienna. However, the resolution in favour
of a renamed law is problematic in so far as concerns its arguments based on
the history of cosmology in the relevant period from about 1927 to the early
1930s. A critical examination of the resolution reveals flaws of a non-trivial

Accepted for publication in ApJ Letters",,"10.3847/2041-8213/aadf87",,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present polarimetric data of CW Tau and DG Tau, two well-known Class II
disk/jet systems, obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array at 870 $\mu$m and 0.""2 average resolution. In CW Tau, the total and
polarized emission are both smooth and symmetric, with polarization angles
almost parallel to the minor axis of the projected disk. In contrast, DG Tau
displays a structured polarized emission, with an elongated brighter region in
the disk's near side and a belt-like feature beyond about 0.""3 from the source.
At the same time the total intensity is spatially smooth, with no features. The
polarization pattern, almost parallel to the minor axis in the inner region,
becomes azimuthal in the outer belt, possibly because of a drop in optical
depth. The polarization fraction has average values of 1.2% in CW Tau and 0.4%
in DG Tau. Our results are consistent with polarization from self-scattering of
the dust thermal emission. Under this hypothesis, the maximum size of the
grains contributing to polarization is in the range 100 - 150 $\mu$m for CW Tau
and 50 - 70 $\mu$m for DG Tau. The polarization maps combined with dust opacity
estimates indicate that these grains are distributed in a geometrically thin
layer in CW Tau, representing a settling in the disk midplane. Meanwhile, such
settling is not yet apparent for DG Tau. These results advocate polarization
studies as a fundamental complement to total emission observations, in
investigations of the structure and the evolution of protoplanetary disks.

role for the stabilization and control of chirality of skyrmion textures in

less studied aspect of the DMI is that this interaction is believed to be
operative in the vicinity of lattice imperfections in crystalline magnetic
materials, due to the local structural inversion symmetry breaking. If this
scenario leads to an effect of sizable magnitude, it implies that the DMI
introduces chirality into a very large class of magnetic
materials---defect-rich systems such as polycrystalline magnets. Here, we show
experimentally that the microstructural-defect-induced DMI gives rise to a
polarization-dependent asymmetric term in the small-angle neutron scattering
(SANS) cross section of polycrystalline ferromagnets with a centrosymmetric
crystal structure. The results are supported by theoretical predictions using
the continuum theory of micromagnetics. This effect, conjectured already by
Arrott in 1963, is demonstrated for nanocrystalline terbium and holmium (with a
large grain-boundary density), and for mechanically-deformed microcrystalline
cobalt (with a large dislocation density). Analysis of the scattering asymmetry
allows one to determine the defect-induced DMI constant, $D = 0.45 \pm 0.07 \,
\mathrm{mJ/m^2}$ for Tb at $100 \, \mathrm{K}$. Our study proves the generic
relevance of the DMI for the magnetic microstructure of defect-rich
ferromagnets with vanishing intrinsic DMI. Polarized SANS is decisive for
disclosing the signature of the defect-induced DMI, which is related to the
unique dependence of the polarized SANS cross section on the chiral
interactions. The findings open up the way to study defect-induced skyrmionic
magnetization textures in disordered materials.

coasts. The eastern North Atlantic is found to be influenced by the combination
of low-frequency forcing (>10 day bandpassed winds) contributing up to 60% and

Killing vector field. This proves a conjecture by Moncrief and Isenberg from
1983 under the assumption on the surface gravity and generalises previous

generators of the Cauchy horizon were closed or densely filled a 2-torus.
Consequently, the maximal globally hyperbolic vacuum development of generic
initial data cannot be extended across a compact Cauchy horizon with surface
gravity that can be normalised to a non-zero constant. Our result supports,
thereby, the validity of the strong cosmic censorship conjecture in the
considered special case. The proof consists of two main steps. First, we show
that the Killing equation can be solved up to any order at the Cauchy horizon.
Second, by applying a recent result of the first author on wave equations with
initial data on a compact Cauchy horizon, we show that this Killing vector

photons that have not ""seen"" the object. Traditionally this phenomenon has
required initially correlated but spatially separated photons, e.g., one to
interact with the object and the other to form the image, and has been observed
in many physical situations, spanning both the quantum and classical regimes.
To date, all instances of ghost imaging record an image with the same contrast
as the object, i.e., where the object is bright, the image is also bright, and
vice versa. Here we observe ghost imaging in a new system - a system based on
photons that have never interacted. We utilise entanglement swapping between
independent pairs of spatially entangled photons to establish position
correlations between two initially independent photons. As a consequence of an
anti-symmetric projection in the entanglement swapping process, the recorded
image is the contrast reversed version of the object, i.e., where the object is
bright, the image is dark, and vice versa. The results highlight the importance
of state projection in this ghost imaging process and provides a pathway to
teleporting images across a quantum network.

a configuration of pebbles and may make pebbling moves by removing 2 pebbles
from one vertex and placing one at an adjacent vertex to eventually have one
pebble reach a predetermined vertex. The pebbling number, $\pi(G)$, is the
minimum number of pebbles such that regardless of their exact configuration,
the player can use pebbling moves to have a pebble reach any predetermined
vertex.
  Previous work has related $\pi(G)$ to the diameter of $G$. Clarke, Hochberg,
and Hurlbert demonstrated that every connected undirected graph on $n$ vertices
with diameter 2 has $\pi(G) = n$ unless it belongs to an exceptional family of
graphs, consisting of those that can be constructed in a specific manner; in
which case $\pi(G) = n +1$. By generalizing a result of Chan and Godbole,
Postle showed that for a graph with diameter $d$, $\pi(G) \le n 2^{\lceil
\frac{d}{2} \rceil} (1+o_n(1))$.
  In this article, we continue this study relating pebbling and diameter with a
focus on directed graphs. This leads to some surprising results. First, we show
that in an oriented directed graph $G$ (in the sense that if $i \to j$ then we
cannot have $j \to i$), it is indeed the case that if $G$ has diameter 2,
$\pi(G) = n$ or $n + 1$, and if $\pi(G) = n+1$, the directed graph has a very
particular structure. In the case of general directed graphs (that is, if $i
\to j$, we may or may not have an arc $j \to i$) with diameter 2, we show that
$\pi(G)$ can be as large as $\frac32 n + 1$, and further, this bound is sharp.
More generally, we show that for general directed graphs, $\pi(G) \le 2^d n / d
+ f(d)$ where $f(d)$ is some function of only $d$.

estimate spectra or discriminate between spectra of minuscule amounts of

suffer from detrimental inherent noise. This strong noise masks to the weak
signal and results in a very low signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, the noise
model is usually complex and unknown, which renders the data processing of the
measurement results very complicated. Hence, spectra discrimination is hard to
achieve and in particular, it is difficult to reach the optimal discrimination.
In this work we present strong indications that this difficulty can be overcome
by deep learning (DL) algorithms. The DL algorithms can mitigate the
adversarial effects of the noise efficiently by effectively learning the noise
model. We show that in the case of frequency discrimination DL algorithms reach
the optimal discrimination without having any pre-knowledge of the physical
model. Moreover, the DL discrimination scheme outperform Bayesian methods when
verified on noisy experimental data obtained by a single Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV)
center. In the case of frequency resolution we show that this approach
outperforms Bayesian methods even when the latter have full pre-knowledge of
the noise model and the former has none. These DL algorithms also emerge as
much more efficient in terms of computational resources and run times. Since in
many real-world scenarios the noise is complex and difficult to model, we argue
that DL is likely to become a dominant tool in the field.

linear theory of warped accretion discs to find the disc shape when the stream
produced by the disrupted star provides a source of mass and angular momentum
that is misaligned with the black hole. The evolution of the surface density
and aspect ratio is found from a one dimensional vertically averaged model.
  We extend previous work which assumed a quasi-stationary disc to allow
unrestricted dynamical propagation of disc tilt and twist through time
dependent backgrounds. We consider a smaller value of the viscosity parameter,
$\alpha =0.01,$ finding the dynamics varies significantly.
  At early times the disc inclination is found to be nearly uniform at small
radii where the aspect ratio is large. However, since torques arise from the
Lense-Thirring effect and the stream there is non uniform precession. We
propose a simple model for this requiring only the background surface density
and aspect ratio.
  At these times the $\alpha \sim 0.01$ disc exhibits a new feature. An
inclined hot inner region joins an outer low inclination cool region via a thin
transition front propagating outwards with a speed exceeding that of bending
waves in the cool region. These waves accumulate where the propagation speeds
match producing an inclination spike separating inner and outer discs. At late
times a sequence of quasi-stationary configurations approximates disc shapes at
small radii. We discuss observational implications of our results.

second-scale Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) in burst source sizes and
orientation with simultaneous QPOs in intensity. The observed oscillations in

and a cavity mode satisfies the criteria for a quantum non-demolition (QND)
measurement only if the coupling between the qubit and cavity is much less than
their mutual detuning. This can put significant limits on the speed of the
measurement, requiring trade-offs in the circuit design between coupling,
detuning, and decoherence introduced by the cavity mode. Here, we study a
circuit in which the qubit-cavity and the cavity-feedline coupling can be
turned on and off, which helps to isolate the qubit. We do not rely on the
rotating-wave or dispersive approximations, but solve the full transverse
interaction between the qubit and the cavity mode. We show that by carefully
choosing the detuning and interaction time, we can exploit a recurrence in the
qubit-cavity dynamics in a way that makes it possible to perform very fast,
high fidelity, QND measurements. Here, the qubit measurement is performed more
like a gate operation between the qubit and the cavity, where the cavity state
can be amplified, squeezed, and released in a time-sequenced fashion. In
addition, we also show that the non-demolition property of the off-resonant
approximation breaks down much faster than its dispersive property, suggesting

of visible light for high-speed wireless communication. Since each VLC access
point covers a small area, handovers of mobile users are inevitable. In order
to deal with these handovers, developing fast and effective resource allocation
algorithms is a challenge. This paper introduces the problem of mobility-aware
optimization of resources in VLC networks using the T-step look-ahead policy
and employing the notion of handover efficiency. It is shown that the handover
efficiency can correlate the overall performance of the network with future
actions based on the mobility of users. Due to the stationary nature of indoor
optical wireless channels, future channel state information (CSI) can be
predicted by anticipating the future locations of users. A resource allocation
algorithm is thus proposed, which uses CSI to dynamically allocate network
resources to users. To solve this mathematically intractable problem, a novel
relaxation method is proposed, which proves to be a useful tool to develop
efficient algorithms for network optimization problems with a proportional
fairness utility function. The resulting algorithm is extremely faster than the
previous method and awareness of mobility enhances the overall performance of
the network in terms of rate and fairness utility function.

accelerating the convolutional layers in deep neural networks. The core idea is
to decompose convolution into two stages, which first reduce the spatial
resolution of the feature map, and then restore it to the desired size. This
operation decreases the sampling density in the spatial domain, which is
independent yet complementary to network acceleration approaches in the channel
domain. Using different sampling rates, we can tradeoff between recognition
accuracy and model complexity.
  As a basic building block, spatial bottleneck can be used to replace any
single convolutional layer, or the combination of two convolutional layers. We
empirically verify the effectiveness of spatial bottleneck by applying it to
the deep residual networks. Spatial bottleneck achieves 2x and 1.4x speedup on
the regular and channel-bottlenecked residual blocks, respectively, with the
accuracies retained in recognizing low-resolution images, and even improved in
recognizing high-resolution images.

Fermi-Dirac statistics of bosons and fermions, was proposed by Haldane[1]. The
relevant past studies had considered only anyon systems without any physical
boundary but boundaries often appear in real-life materials. When fusion of
anyons is involved, certain `pseudo-species' anyons appear in the exotic
statistical weights of non-Abelian anyon systems; however, the meaning and
significance of pseudo-species remains an open problem. In this paper, we
propose an extended anyon exclusion statistics on surfaces with gapped
boundaries, introducing mutual exclusion statistics between anyons as well as
the boundary components. Motivated by Refs. [2, 3], we present a formula for
the statistical weight of many-anyon states obeying the proposed statistics. We
develop a systematic basis construction for non-Abelian anyons on any Riemann
surfaces with gapped boundaries. From the basis construction, we have a
standard way to read off a canonical set of statistics parameters and hence
write down the extended statistical weight of the anyon system being studied.
The basis construction reveals the meaning of pseudo-species. A pseudo-species
has different `excitation' modes, each corresponding to an anyon species. The
`excitation' modes of pseudo-species corresponds to good quantum numbers of
subsystems of a non-Abelian anyon system. This is important because often
(e.g., in topological quantum computing) we may be concerned about only the
entanglement between such subsystems.

statistical analysis has been studied to efficiently obtain approximate
estimates by analyzing only a small but representative subset of the system's
behavior. In this paper we propose a hybrid statistical estimation method that
combines precise and statistical analyses to estimate mutual information,
Shannon entropy, and conditional entropy, together with their confidence
intervals. We show how to combine the analyses on different components of a
discrete system with different accuracy to obtain an estimate for the whole
system. The new method performs weighted statistical analysis with different
sample sizes over different components and dynamically finds their optimal
sample sizes. Moreover, it can reduce sample sizes by using prior knowledge
about systems and a new abstraction-then-sampling technique based on
qualitative analysis. To apply the method to the source code of a system, we
show how to decompose the code into components and to determine the analysis
method for each component by overviewing the implementation of those techniques
in the HyLeak tool. We demonstrate with case studies that the new method

cluster with a massive, central black hole, this approximation reproduces the
familiar Bahcall-Wolf quasistatic density cusp for the stars bound to the black
hole and shows how the cusp halts the ""gravothermal catastrophe"" and causes the
cluster to re-expand. An SIDM halo with an initial black hole central density
spike that matches onto to an exterior NFW profile relaxes to a core-halo
structure with a central density cusp determined by the velocity dependence of
the SIDM interaction cross section. The success and relative simplicity of the

geometric progression work very well both for short-range and long-range
behavior of the few-body wave functions. Use of Gaussians with complex ranges
gives much more accurate solution when the wave function has many oscillations.

used to probe the structure of the radiative zone where is near the outer
boundary of the convective core and constrain the chemical mixing in stellar
interiors. In SPB stars, the period spacing periodically varies with periods.
It has regarded as a signature of the chemical composition gradient beyond the
convective core. Based on theoretical calculations, we find that the variation
frequency of the period spacings ($f_{\Delta P}$) is related to the width of
the $\mu$-gradient region on the buoyancy radius ($\Lambda_{\mu}$) with the
relation of $f_{\Delta P}\sim0.5\Lambda_{\mu}$. This indicates that the
variation frequency $f_{\Delta P}$ is sensitive to the central hydrogen mass
fraction $X_{\rm C}$ (i.e., the evolutionary status). Finally, we find that the
variation frequency $f_{\Delta P}$ and the means of the period spacings
$\langle\Delta P\rangle$ can be used to construct a new C-D-like diagram
($f_{\Delta P}$ vs. $\langle\Delta P\rangle$) which can be used to roughly
decide the stellar evolutionary stages and to approximately determine stellar

differential operators that are polynomials in the variables and their partial

to a specific solution of the non-homogeneous differential equation, which can
be measured to reveal features of the solution. The algorithm consists of three
stages: preparing fixed resource states in ancillary systems, performing
Hamiltonian simulation, and measuring the ancilla systems. The algorithm can be
carried out using standard methods for gate decompositions, but we improve this
in two ways. First, we show that for a wide class of differential operators, it
is possible to derive exact decompositions for the gates employed in
Hamiltonian simulation. This avoids the need for costly commutator
approximations, reducing gate counts by orders of magnitude. Additionally, we
employ methods from machine learning to find explicit circuits that prepare the

spectrum ($\sigma$) can be much lighter than the vector state ($\rho$) and
nearly degenerate with the PNGBs ($\pi$) over a large range of quark masses.
The EFT incorporates this feature. We highlight the crucial role played by the
terms in the potential that explicitly break chiral symmetry. The explicit
breaking can be large enough so that a limited set of additional terms in the
potential can no longer be neglected, with the EFT still weakly coupled in this
new range. The additional terms contribute importantly to the scalar and pion

disturbing function describing the secular evolution of coplanar objects, which
is explicitly related (via one-dimensional, convergent integrals) to the disk
surface density and eccentricity profiles without using any ad hoc softening of
the potential. Our analytical framework is verified via direct orbit
integrations, which show it to be accurate in the low-eccentricity limit for a
variety of disk models (for disk eccentricity < 0.1-0.2). We find that free
precession in the potential of a disk with a smooth surface density
distribution can naturally change from prograde to retrograde within the disk.
Sharp disk features - edges and gaps - are the locations where this tendency is
naturally enhanced, while the precession becomes very fast. Radii where free
precession changes sign are the locations where substantial (formally singular)
growth of the forced eccentricity of the orbiting objects occurs. Based on our

One of the key challenges lies in the difficulty of ensuring semantic validity
in context. For examples, in molecular graphs, the number of bonding-electron
pairs must not exceed the valence of an atom; whereas in protein interaction
networks, two proteins may be connected only when they belong to the same or
correlated gene ontology terms. These constraints are not easy to be
incorporated into a generative model. In this work, we propose a regularization
framework for variational autoencoders as a step toward semantic validity. We
focus on the matrix representation of graphs and formulate penalty terms that
regularize the output distribution of the decoder to encourage the satisfaction
of validity constraints. Experimental results confirm a much higher likelihood
of sampling valid graphs in our approach, compared with others reported in the
literature.

conductance and negative differential resistance in the vicinity of zero
interlayer bias, which stem from energy- and momentum-conserving tunneling.
Because the spin-orbit coupling leads to coupled spin-valley degrees of

conservation of spin-valley degree of freedom in tunneling. In heterostructures
where the two WSe2 monolayers have a 180{\deg} relative twist, such that the
Brillouin zone of one layer is aligned with the time-reversed Brillouin zone of

been slightly deformed in an arbitrary way. Setting up a perturbation series up
to second order, we derive both the frequency shifts and modified linewidths.
Our theory is applicable, for example, to freely levitated liquid drops or
solid spheres, which are deformed by thermal surface vibrations, centrifugal
forces or arbitrary surface waves. A dielectric sphere is effectively an open
system whose description requires the introduction of non-Hermitian operators
characterized by complex eigenvalues and not normalizable eigenfunctions. We
avoid these difficulties using the Kapur-Peierls formalism which enables us to
extend the popular Rayleigh-Schr\""{o}dinger perturbation theory to the case of
electromagnetic Debye's potentials describing the light fields inside and
outside the near-spherical dielectric object. We find analytical formulas,
valid within certain limits, for the deformation-induced first- and
second-order corrections to the central frequency and bandwidth of a resonance.
As an application of our method, we compare our results with preexisting ones

InAs. The propagation of a plasmonic wave through this structure is
investigated numerically. By calculation of normalized localization length for
systems with different disorder strengths, it is determined whether or not the
system is in the localized regime. For some frequencies, depending on the
disorder level, Anderson localization occurs for plasmonic waves propagating
through the graphene layer. Furthermore, the effect of optical loss on the
localization length is studied. By calculating the localization length at
different temperatures, it is observed that Anderson localization of graphene
plasmons is temperature dependent and can be controlled by changing the
temperature. In the transmission spectrum for each random realization, there
are some resonance peaks which are blue-shifted with increasing the
temperature. Finally, the effects of Fermi energy level of the graphene layer
and width of air gaps on the individual transmission resonances are examined.

for the thermoelectric figure of merit: the temperature variations of the
direct gap and the difference in energies of the two topmost valence band
maxima located at L and $\Sigma$. We account for the energy shift of the
electronic states due to thermal expansion, as well as electron-phonon
interaction computed using the non-adiabatic Allen-Heine-Cardona formalism
within density functional perturbation theory and the local density
approximation. We capture the increase of the direct gap with temperature in
very good agreement with experiment. We also predict that the valence band
maxima at L and $\Sigma$ become aligned at $\sim 600-700$ K. We find that both
thermal expansion and electron-phonon interaction have a considerable effect on
these temperature variations. The Fan-Migdal and Debye-Waller terms are of
almost equal magnitude but have an opposite sign, and the delicate balance of
these terms gives the correct band shifts. The electron-phonon induced
renormalization of the direct gap is produced mostly by high-frequency optical
phonons, while acoustic phonons are also responsible for the alignment of the
valence band maxima at L and $\Sigma$.

electron-paramagnetic-resonance (CW EPR) measurements versus applied magnetic

terms.
  We also compare this approach with Ehrhard's theory of program approximation
based on the Taylor expansion of lambda terms, translating each lambda term
into a possibly infinite set of so-called resource terms. We provide sufficient
and necessary conditions for a set of resource terms in order to be the Taylor
expansion of a lambda term. Finally, we show that the normal form of the Taylor
expansion of a lambda term can be computed by performing a normalized Taylor
expansion of its B\""ohm tree. From this it follows that two lambda terms have
the same B\""ohm tree if and only if the normal forms of their Taylor expansions
coincide.

stellar kinematics. The analysis of its star formation history indicates that
the quenching process lasted for a few Gyr and that the star formation declined

galaxy is characterised by a two-component stellar disk with an extended gas
disk that formed a few 10^8 yr ago, most likely as a consequence of gas
accretion. The third member is a spiral galaxy at the edges of the group, but
embedded in a filament. We hypothesise that the compression exerted by the
sparse intergalactic medium on the dense circumgalactic gas switches on star
formation in a number of clouds surrounding the galaxy (""cosmic web

Finally, the fourth galaxy is a spiral with a truncated ionised gas disk and an

researched by the optical and microwave communities over the past century and
until today. However, due to the diverging wave impedances of TE (s) and TM (p)
polarizations with increasing incident angle, it is impossible to achieve
perfect matching simultaneously for both polarizations at an oblique incident
angle with a single conventional matching layer. In this paper, we show that
simultaneous perfecting matching of an arbitrary substrate at an arbitrary
incident angle from air is possible with a single uniaxial metamaterial
matching layer (UMML) that possesses specific permittivity and permeability
tensors. We demonstrate this concept by synthesizing a physical UMML to match a
high-index ({\epsilon}r= 10.2) substrate at 45{\deg}. The required permittivity
and permittivity tensors of the UMML are achieved through the judicious control
of the tangential and longitudinal electric and magnetic responses. Around -30
dB reflections are observed for both polarizations at the design angle.
Building on the UMML concept, we design a novel radome in microwave regime with
a near omni-directional matching performance. For incident angles from
0{\deg}-85{\deg}, reflections remain below -14 dB for both polarizations. To
our best knowledge, this is the widest angular range that has been achieved
while maintaining less than 5% power reflection for both polarizations. The
proposed UMML concept offers a new paradigm for designing high-performance
microwave, terahertz, and optical devices.

phonon dynamics. The measurements were underpinned by ab initio lattice
dynamical calculations. Good agreement was found between the measured and

$\alpha_a$=-21.2 $\times$ 10$^{-6}$ K$^{-1}$ and
$\alpha_c$=+14.6$\times$10$^{-6}$K$^{-1}$, leading to an overall volume

parameters shows that optic modes around 12 and 40 meV make a significant
contribution to NTE. These modes involve localized rotational motions of the
[NiC$_4$] and/or [ZnN$_4$] rigid units, echoing what has previously been
observed in Zn(CN)$_2$ and Ni(CN)$_2$. However, in ZnNi(CN)$_4$, modes below 10
meV have the most negative Gr\""uneisen parameters. Analysis of their
eigenvectors reveals that a large transverse motion of the Ni atom in the
direction perpendicular to its square-planar environment induces a distortion
of the units. This mode is a consequence of the Ni atom being constrained only
in 2D within a 3D framework. Hence, although rigid-unit modes account for some
of the NTE-driving phonons, the added d-o-f compared with Zn(CN)$_2$ results in
modes with twisting motions, capable of inducing greater NTE.

  Retrieval","12 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most existing works of adversarial samples focus on attacking image
recognition models, while little attention is paid to the image retrieval task.
In this paper, we identify two inherent challenges in applying prevailing image
recognition attack methods to image retrieval. First, image retrieval demands
discriminative visual features, which is significantly different from the
one-hot class prediction in image recognition. Second, due to the disjoint and
potentially unrelated classes between the training and test set in image
retrieval, predicting the query category from predefined training classes is
not accurate and leads to a sub-optimal adversarial gradient. To address these
limitations, we propose a new white-box attack approach, Opposite-Direction
Feature Attack (ODFA), to generate adversarial queries. Opposite-Direction
Feature Attack (ODFA) effectively exploits feature-level adversarial gradients
and takes advantage of feature distance in the representation space. To our
knowledge, we are among the early attempts to design an attack method
specifically for image retrieval. When we deploy an attacked image as the
query, the true matches are prone to receive low ranks. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that (1) only crafting adversarial queries is sufficient
to fool the state-of-the-art retrieval systems; (2) the proposed attack method,
ODFA, leads to a higher attack success rate than classification attack methods,
validating the necessity of leveraging characteristics of image retrieval; (3)
the adversarial queries generated by our method have good transferability to
other retrieval models without accessing their parameters, i.e.,the black-box
setting.

local $f$ spins at high temperatures dissolve into the sea of quantum
conduction electrons at low temperatures, where they become mobile excitations.
Once mobile, the spins acquire charge, forming electrons of heavy mass, known
as heavy fermions. In turn, the incorporation of heavy charges into the
conduction sea leads to an increase in the volume of the Fermi surface. This
process, called Kondo scattering, is accompanied by a dramatic, temperature
dependent transformation of the electronic interactions and masses. Since the
Kondo phenomena is controlled by quantum fluctuations, here we ask, at which
point does the Fermi surface change character? A priori, the answer is not
clear, since near its onset, the Kondo effect cannot be described as a simple
hybridization of electronic eigenstates. Conventional descriptions of this
Kondo scattering process consider that hybridization, Fermi volume change, and
$f$-electron mobility occur simultaneously. However, using angle resolved
photoemission spectroscopy to measure the evolution of excitations, we find
that the changes of the Fermi surface emerge at temperatures an order of
magnitude higher than the opening of the hybridization gap, and two orders of
magnitude higher than the onset of the coherent character of the $f$-electrons.
We suggest that the large changes in Fermi volume, driven by electronic
fluctuations, occur at temperatures where the various $\Gamma_x \to \Gamma_y$
crystal field-split $f$ levels become accessible to conduction states of the
corresponding symmetries. The separation of these energy scales significantly
modifies the conventional description of the Kondo lattice effect, which still
lacks a full theoretical description.

problems with new consumption models. A common goal is to share a resource,
such as CPU or I/O bandwidth, among distinct users with different demand
patterns as well as different quality of service requirements. To ensure these
service requirements, cloud offerings often come with a service level agreement
(SLA) between the provider and the users. An SLA specifies the amount of a
resource a user is entitled to utilize. In many cloud settings, providers would
like to operate resources at high utilization while simultaneously respecting
individual SLAs. There is typically a tradeoff between these two objectives;
for example, utilization can be increased by shifting away resources from idle
users to ""scavenger"" workload, but with the risk of the former then becoming
active again. We study this fundamental tradeoff by formulating a resource
allocation model that captures basic properties of cloud computing systems,
including SLAs, highly limited feedback about the state of the system, and
variable and unpredictable input sequences. Our main result is a simple and
practical algorithm that achieves near-optimal performance on the above two
objectives. First, we guarantee nearly optimal utilization of the resource even
if compared to the omniscient offline dynamic optimum. Second, we
simultaneously satisfy all individual SLAs up to a small error. The main
algorithmic tool is a multiplicative weight update algorithm, and a primal-dual
argument to obtain its guarantees. We also provide numerical validation on real
data to demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in practical applications.

are self-enforcing pieces of software, which reside and run over a hosting
blockchain. Using blockchain-based smart contracts for secure and transparent
management to govern interactions (authentication, connection, and transaction)
in Internet-enabled environments, mostly IoT, is a niche area of research and
practice. However, writing trustworthy and safe smart contracts can be
tremendously challenging because of the complicated semantics of underlying

incidents that indicate blockchain smart contracts could contain various
code-security vulnerabilities, instigating financial harms. When it involves
security of smart contracts, developers embracing the ability to write the

vulnerabilities, before deploying them to the immutable environments on

conservative semi-discretizations with different forms of Hamiltonian

up to 20 MeV, were measured by the stacked-foil technique and high resolution
gamma spectrometry using U-120M cyclotron of the Center of Accelerators and
Nuclear Analytical Methods (CANAM) of the Nuclear Physics Institute of the

strengthens for the first time their consistent account provided that (i) a
suitable BU and DR assessment is completed by (ii) the assumption of PE and CN

Conclusions: The suitable description of nuclear mechanisms involved within

construct new formulas for the operations in each individual layer so that they
can handle multi-dimensional edge features. Third, for the proposed new

Our evaluation metrics leads to some interesting understandings of recent

Chemistry that offers an attractive trade off between the cost and accuracy of
quantum chemical computations. The electron density plays a key role in DFT. In
this work, we explore whether machine learning - more specifically, deep neural
networks (DNNs) - can be trained to predict electron densities faster than DFT.
First, we choose a practically efficient combination of a DFT functional and a
basis set (PBE0/pcS-3) and use it to generate a database of DFT solutions for
more than 133,000 organic molecules from a previously published database QM9.
Next, we train a DNN to predict electron densities and energies of such
molecules. The only input to the DNN is an approximate electron density
computed with a cheap quantum chemical method in a small basis set (HF/cc-VDZ).
We demonstrate that the DNN successfully learns differences in the electron
densities arising both from electron correlation and small basis set artifacts
in the HF computations. All qualitative features in density differences,
including local minima on lone pairs, local maxima on nuclei, toroidal shapes
around C-H and C-C bonds, complex shapes around aromatic and cyclopropane rings
and CN group, etc. are captured by the DNN. Accuracy of energy predictions by
the DNN is ~ 1 kcal/mol, on par with other models reported in the literature,
while those models do not predict the electron density. Computations with the
DNN, including HF computations, take much less time that DFT computations (by a
factor of ~20-30 for most QM9 molecules in the current version, and it is clear
how it could be further improved).

challenges that arise in the study of anomalous human trajectories: 1) a lack
of ground truth data on what defines an anomaly and 2) the dependence of
existing methods on significant pre-processing and feature engineering. While
generative adversarial networks seem like a natural fit for addressing these
challenges, we find that existing GAN based anomaly detection algorithms
perform poorly due to their inability to handle multimodal patterns. For this
purpose we introduce an infinite Gaussian mixture model coupled with
(bi-directional) generative adversarial networks, IGMM-GAN, that is able to
generate synthetic, yet realistic, human mobility data and simultaneously
facilitates multimodal anomaly detection. Through estimation of a generative
probability density on the space of human trajectories, we are able to generate
realistic synthetic datasets that can be used to benchmark existing anomaly
detection methods. The estimated multimodal density also allows for a natural
definition of outlier that we use for detecting anomalous trajectories. We
illustrate our methodology and its improvement over existing GAN anomaly
detection on several human mobility datasets, along with MNIST.

temporarily enhance the D-region of the ionosphere and attenuate low-frequency
radio waves. To track these Sudden Ionospheric Disturbances (SIDs), which
disrupt communication signals and perturb satellite orbits, Scherrer et al.
(2008) developed an international, ground-based network of around 500 SID
monitors that measure the signal strength of low-frequency radio waves.
However, these monitors suffer from a host of noise contamination issues that
preclude their use for rigorous scientific analysis. As such, we attempt to
create an algorithm to automatically identify noisy, contaminated SID data sets
from clean ones. To do so, we develop a set of features to characterize times
series measurements from SID monitors and use these features, along with a
binary classifer called a support vector machine, to automatically assess the
quality of the SID data. We compute the True Skill Score, a metric that
measures the performance of our classifier, and find that it is ~0.75+/-0.06.
We find features characterizing the difference between the daytime and
nighttime signal strength of low-frequency radio waves most effectively discern
noisy data sets from clean ones.

  Background","8 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  3D point cloud generation by the deep neural network from a single image has
been attracting more and more researchers' attention. However,
recently-proposed methods require the objects be captured with relatively clean
backgrounds, fixed viewpoint, while this highly limits its application in the
real environment. To overcome these drawbacks, we proposed to integrate the
prior 3D shape knowledge into the network to guide the 3D generation. By taking
additional 3D information, the proposed network can handle the 3D object
generation from a single real image captured from any viewpoint and complex
background. Specifically, giving a query image, we retrieve the nearest shape
model from a pre-prepared 3D model database. Then, the image together with the
retrieved shape model is fed into the proposed network to generate the
fine-grained 3D point cloud. The effectiveness of our proposed framework has
been verified on different kinds of datasets. Experimental results show that
the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art accuracy compared to other
volumetric-based and point set generation methods. Furthermore, the proposed
framework works well for real images in complex backgrounds with various view
angles.

properties. Two fundamental challenges are: (i) it is not trivial to generate
valid molecules in a controllable way due to hard chemical constraints such as
the valency conditions, and (ii) it is often costly to evaluate a property of a
novel molecule, and therefore, the number of property evaluations is limited.
These challenges are to some extent alleviated by a combination of a
variational autoencoder (VAE) and Bayesian optimization (BO). VAE converts a
molecule into/from its latent continuous vector, and BO optimizes a latent
continuous vector (and its corresponding molecule) within a limited number of
property evaluations. While the most recent work, for the first time, achieved
100% validity, its architecture is rather complex due to auxiliary neural
networks other than VAE, making it difficult to train. This paper presents a
molecular hypergraph grammar variational autoencoder (MHG-VAE), which uses a
single VAE to achieve 100% validity. Our idea is to develop a graph grammar
encoding the hard chemical constraints, called molecular hypergraph grammar
(MHG), which guides VAE to always generate valid molecules. We also present an
algorithm to construct MHG from a set of molecules.

switched discrete and continuous systems with multiple equilibria. It is shown
that if each subsystem of the switched system is Input-to-State Stable (ISS),
then under switching signals that satisfy an average dwell-time bound, the
solutions are ultimately bounded within a compact set. Furthermore, the size of
this set varies monotonically with the supremum norm of the disturbance signal.
It is observed that when the subsystems share a common equilibrium, ISS is
recovered for solutions of the corresponding switched system; hence, the
results in this paper are a natural generalization of classical results in
switched systems that exhibit a common equilibrium. Additionally, we provide a
method to analytically compute the average dwell time if each subsystem
possesses a quadratic ISS-Lyapunov function. Our motivation for studying this
class of switched systems arises from certain motion planning problems in
robotics, where primitive motions, each corresponding to an equilibrium point
of a dynamical system, must be composed to realize a task. However, the results

low power wireless communications. In this article, we propose an optimal and
low-complexity dynamic spectrum access framework for RF-powered ambient
backscatter system. In this system, the secondary transmitter not only harvests
energy from ambient signals (from incumbent users), but also backscatters these
signals to its receiver for data transmission. Under the dynamics of the
ambient signals, we first adopt the Markov decision process (MDP) framework to
obtain the optimal policy for the secondary transmitter, aiming to maximize the
system throughput. However, the MDP-based optimization requires complete
knowledge of environment parameters, e.g., the probability of a channel to be
idle and the probability of a successful packet transmission, that may not be
practical to obtain. To cope with such incomplete knowledge of the environment,
we develop a low-complexity online reinforcement learning algorithm that allows
the secondary transmitter to ""learn"" from its decisions and then attain the
optimal policy. Simulation results show that the proposed learning algorithm
not only efficiently deals with the dynamics of the environment, but also
improves the average throughput up to 50% and reduces the blocking probability
and delay up to 80% compared with conventional methods.

However, due to the complexities of this phenomenon, accurate and yet simple
models of such lane change maneuvers are hard to develop. In this work, we
present a macroscopic model for predicting the number of vehicles that bypass
at a traffic diverge. We take into account the selfishness of vehicles in
selecting their lanes; every vehicle selects lanes such that its own cost is
minimized. We discuss how we model the costs experienced by the vehicles. Then,
taking into account the selfish behavior of the vehicles, we model the lane
choice of vehicles at a traffic diverge as a Wardrop equilibrium. We state and
prove the properties of Wardrop equilibrium in our model. We show that there
always exists an equilibrium for our model. Moreover, unlike most nonlinear
asymmetrical routing games, we prove that the equilibrium is unique under mild
assumptions. We discuss how our model can be easily calibrated by running a
simple optimization problem. Using our calibrated model, we validate it through
simulation studies and demonstrate that our model successfully predicts the
aggregate lane change maneuvers that are performed by vehicles for bypassing at
a traffic diverge. We further discuss how our model can be employed to obtain
the optimal lane choice behavior of the vehicles, where the social or total
cost of vehicles is minimized. Finally, we demonstrate how our model can be
utilized in scenarios where a central authority can dictate the lane choice and
trajectory of certain vehicles so as to increase the overall vehicle mobility
at a traffic diverge. Examples of such scenarios include the case when both
human driven and autonomous vehicles coexist in the network. We show how

consider the impact of previous environments prior to cluster infall, namely
preprocessing. We use YZiCS, a hydrodynamic high-resolution zoom-in simulation
of 15 clusters, and focus on the tidal stripping suffered by the dark matter
halos of cluster members due to preprocessing. We find ~48% of today's cluster
members were once satellites of other hosts. This is slightly higher than
previous estimates, in part, because we consider not just group-mass hosts, but
hosts of all masses also. Thus, we find the preprocessed fraction is poorly
correlated with cluster mass and is instead related to each cluster's recent
mass growth rate. Hosts less massive than groups are significant contributors,
providing more than one-third of the total preprocessed fraction. We find that
halo mass loss is a clear function of the time spent in hosts. However, two
factors can increase the mass loss rate considerably; the mass ratio of a
satellite to its host, and the cosmological epoch when the satellite was
hosted. The latter means we may have previously underestimated the role of high
redshift groups. From a sample of heavily tidally stripped members in clusters
today, nearly three quarters were previously in a host. Thus, visibly disturbed
cluster members are more likely to have experienced preprocessing. Being hosted
before cluster infall enables cluster members to experience tidal stripping for
extended durations compared to direct cluster infall and at earlier epochs when
hosts were more destructive.

change the fate of $s$-wave superfluids with strong Zeeman field and give rise
to topological superfluids and associated Majorana zero modes. It also
dramatically changes the thermodynamic properties of the superfluids. Here we
report the anomalous isothermal compressibility $\kappa_T$ in this superfluids
with both SOC and Zeeman field. We formulate this quantity from the Gibbs-Duhem
equation and show that the contribution of $\kappa_T$ comes from the explicit
contribution of chemical potential and implicit contribution of order

is determined by the density of state near the Fermi surface; while in the Bose
Einstein condensate (BEC) regime it is determined by the scattering length.
Between these two limits, we find that the anomalous peaks can only be found in
the gapless Weyl phase regime. This anomalous behavior can be regarded as a
remanent effect of phase separation. The similar physics can also be found in
the lattice model away from half filling. These predictions can be measured
from the anomalous response of sound velocity and fluctuation of carrier
density.

Fortunately KIC 832227 was observed in 2003 as part of the NASA Ames pre-Kepler
Vulcan Project to search for transiting exoplanets. We find that the Vulcan
timing measurement does not agree with the previous exponential decay model.
This led us to re-evaluate the other early epoch non-Kepler data sets, the
Northern Sky Variability Survey (NSVS) and Wide Angle Search for Planets (WASP)
survey. We find that the WASP times are in good agreement with the previous
prediction, but the NSVS eclipse time differs by nearly an hour. The very large
disagreement of the Vulcan and NSVS eclipse times with an exponentially
decaying model forces us to reject the merger hypothesis. Although period
variations are common in contact binaries, the physical cause of the period
changes in KIC 9832227 remains unexplained; a third star scenario is unlikely.
This study shows the data collected by the Vulcan photometer to be extremely
valuable for extending the baseline for measurements of variable stars in the

models. Most recent works on adversarial examples for image classification
focus on directly modifying pixels with minor perturbations. A common
requirement in all these works is that the malicious perturbations should be
small enough (measured by an L_p norm for some p) so that they are
imperceptible to humans. However, small perturbations can be unnecessarily
restrictive and limit the diversity of adversarial examples generated. Further,
an L_p norm based distance metric ignores important structure patterns hidden
in images that are important to human perception. Consequently, even the minor
perturbation introduced in recent works often makes the adversarial examples
less natural to humans. More importantly, they often do not transfer well and
are therefore less effective when attacking black-box models especially for
those protected by a defense mechanism. In this paper, we propose a
structure-preserving transformation (SPT) for generating natural and diverse
adversarial examples with extremely high transferability. The key idea of our
approach is to allow perceptible deviation in adversarial examples while
keeping structure patterns that are central to a human classifier. Empirical
results on the MNIST and the fashion-MNIST datasets show that adversarial
examples generated by our approach can easily bypass strong adversarial
training. Further, they transfer well to other target models with no loss or
little loss of successful attack rate.

proposed challenging task for image forensics, which investigates two input
suspected images and identifies whether one image has suspected regions pasted
from the other. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial learning
framework to train the deep matching network for CISDL. Our framework mainly
consists of three building blocks: 1) the deep matching network based on atrous
convolution (DMAC) aims to generate two high-quality candidate masks which
indicate the suspected regions of the two input images, 2) the detection
network is designed to rectify inconsistencies between the two corresponding
candidate masks, 3) the discriminative network drives the DMAC network to
produce masks that are hard to distinguish from ground-truth ones. In DMAC,
atrous convolution is adopted to extract features with rich spatial
information, the correlation layer based on the skip architecture is proposed
to capture hierarchical features, and atrous spatial pyramid pooling is
constructed to localize tampered regions at multiple scales. The detection
network and the discriminative network act as the losses with auxiliary
parameters to supervise the training of DMAC in an adversarial way. Extensive
experiments, conducted on 21 generated testing sets and two public datasets,
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the superior
performance of DMAC.

repositories and versioned text collections - has become an important problem
since the turn of the millennium. A relevant compressibility measure for
repetitive texts is r, the number of runs in their Burrows-Wheeler Transforms

FM-index, used O(r) space and was able to efficiently count the number of
occurrences of a pattern of length m in the text (in loglogarithmic time per
pattern symbol, with current techniques). However, it was unable to locate the
positions of those occurrences efficiently within a space bounded in terms of
r. In this paper we close this long-standing problem, showing how to extend the
Run-Length FM-index so that it can locate the occ occurrences efficiently
within O(r) space (in loglogarithmic time each), and reaching optimal time, O(m
+ occ), within O(r log log w ({\sigma} + n/r)) space, for a text of length n
over an alphabet of size {\sigma} on a RAM machine with words of w =
{\Omega}(log n) bits. Within that space, our index can also count in optimal

locate in O(dm log({\sigma})/we) and O(dm log({\sigma})/we + occ) time, which
is optimal in the packed setting and had not been obtained before in compressed
space. We also describe a structure using O(r log(n/r)) space that replaces the
text and extracts any text substring of length ` in almost-optimal time
O(log(n/r) + ` log({\sigma})/w). Within that space, we similarly provide direct

In social networks, we may pay special attention to user privacy, and would

but current imaging techniques lack either functional contrast or necessary
microscopic resolution. The retina is the only part of the central nervous
system (CNS) that allows us direct optical access. Not only ophthalmic
diseases, but also many degenerative disorders of the CNS go along with
pathological changes in the retina. Consequently, functional analysis of
retinal neurons could lead to an earlier and better diagnosis and understanding
of those diseases. Recently, we showed that an activation of photoreceptor
cells could be visualized in humans using a phase sensitive evaluation of
optical coherence tomography data. The optical path length of the outer
segments changes by a few hundred nanometers in response to optical
stimulation. Here, we show simultaneous imaging of the activation of
photoreceptor and ganglion cells. The signals from the ganglion cells are
ten-fold smaller than those from the photoreceptor cells and were only visible
using new algorithms for suppressing motion artifacts. This allowed us to
generate a wiring diagram showing functional connections between photoreceptors
and ganglion cells. We present a theoretical model that explains the observed
intrinsic optical signals by osmotic volume changes, induced by ion influx or
efflux. Since all neuronal activity is associated with ion fluxes, imaging
osmotic induced size changes with nanometer precision should visualize
activation in any neuron.

some of the cultures, human interests, and public concerns that exist only in
the perceptions of people. Cities are frequently mentioned in news articles,
and two or more cities may co-occur in the same article. Such co-occurrence
often suggests certain relatedness between the mentioned cities, and the
relatedness may be under different topics depending on the contents of the news
articles. We consider the relatedness under different topics as semantic
relatedness. By reading news articles, one can grasp the general semantic
relatedness between cities, yet, given hundreds of thousands of news articles,
it is very difficult, if not impossible, for anyone to manually read them. This
paper proposes a computational framework which can ""read"" a large number of
news articles and extract the semantic relatedness between cities. This
framework is based on a natural language processing model and employs a machine
learning process to identify the main topics of news articles. We describe the
overall structure of this framework and its individual modules, and then apply
it to an experimental dataset with more than 500,000 news articles covering the
top 100 U.S. cities spanning a 10-year period. We perform exploratory

over multiple years. We also analyze the impact of geographic distance on
semantic relatedness and find varied distance decay effects. The proposed

advertisements posted on local-oriented websites, such as Craigslist, where
local place names are often mentioned. The proposed framework consists of two
stages: natural language processing (NLP) and geospatial clustering. The NLP
stage examines the textual content of housing advertisements, and extracts
place name candidates. The geospatial stage focuses on the coordinates
associated with the extracted place name candidates, and performs multi-scale
geospatial clustering to filter out the non-place names. We evaluate our
framework by comparing its performance with those of six baselines. We also
compare our result with four existing gazetteers to demonstrate the

input-queued switch is completely different from the well-understood
delay-unconstrained one and thus poses new challenges. We focus on three
fundamental problems centering around the performance metric of timely
throughput: (i) how to characterize the capacity region? (ii) how to design a
feasibility/throughput-optimal scheduling policy? and (iii) how to design a
network-utility-maximization scheduling policy? We use three different
approaches to solve these three fundamental problems. The first approach is
based on Markov Decision Process (MDP) theory, which can solve all three
problems. However, it suffers from the curse of dimensionality. The second
approach breaks the curse of dimensionality by exploiting the combinatorial
features of the problem. It gives a new capacity region characterization with
only a polynomial number of linear constraints. The third approach is based on
the framework of Lyapunov optimization, where we design a polynomial-time
maximum-weight T-disjoint-matching scheduling policy which is proved to be
feasibility/throughput-optimal. Our three approaches apply to the
frame-synchronized traffic pattern but our MDP-based approach can be extended
to more general traffic patterns.

that is, for the first time, at the same level as the experimental error. The
uncertainty of the semileptonic determination is now similar to that from
leptonic decays and the ratio $f_{K^+}/f_{\pi^+}$, which uses $|V_{ud}|$ as
input. Our value of $|V_{us}|$ is in tension at the 2--$2.6\sigma$ level both
with the determinations from leptonic decays and with the unitarity of the CKM
matrix. In the test of CKM unitarity in the first row, the current limiting
factor is the error in $|V_{ud}|$, although a recent determination of the
nucleus-independent radiative corrections to superallowed nuclear $\beta$
decays could reduce the $|V_{ud}|^2$ uncertainty nearly to that of
$|V_{us}|^2$. Alternative unitarity tests using only kaon decays, for which
improvements in the theory and experimental inputs are likely in the next few
years, reveal similar tensions. As part of our analysis, we calculated the
correction to $f_+^{K\pi}(0)$ due to nonequilibrated topological charge at
leading order in chiral perturbation theory, for both the full-QCD and the
partially-quenched cases. We also obtain the combination of low-energy
constants in the chiral effective Lagrangian
$[C_{12}^r+C_{34}^r-(L_5^r)^2](M_\rho)=(2.92\pm0.31)\cdot10^{-6}$.

interaction between an inert alpha-particle and a neutron. In general case, the
Yakubovsky scheme for the solution of the five-body system leads to a set of
four coupled equations related to four independent configurations, which can be
restricted to two coupled ones, to describe the effective alpha-nucleon
structure model, namely an inert four-body alpha-core and a nucleon. Hence, in
such a model, the other configurations will not be taken into account. To
calculate the binding energies of the five-body system in the model of alpha-
nucleon structure, the two coupled equations are represented in the momentum
space on the basis of the Jacobi momenta. After an explicit evaluation of the
two coupled integral equations in a partial-wave analysis, the obtained
equations are the starting point for a numerical calculation as an eigenvalue
equation form, using typical iteration method. In the first step to the
calculations, i.e. applying some spin-independent potential models, some
obtained binding energy differences between the four-body as an alpha-particle
and the five-body as an alpha-nucleon systems suggest that a simple effective
interaction between an inert alpha-particle and a nucleon is attractive and of
about 13 MeV. In addition, the represented binding energy results with respect
to the regarded spin-independent potentials are in fair agreement with the

increasing research focus, the save on resource consumption always comes with a
decrease in accuracy. To both increase accuracy and decrease resource
consumption, we explore an environment information, called class skew, which is
easily available and exists widely in daily life. Since the class skew may
switch as time goes, we bring up probability layer to utilize class skew
without any overhead during the runtime. Further, we observe class skew
dichotomy that some class skew may appear frequently in the future, called hot
class skew, and others will never appear again or appear seldom, called cold
class skew. Inspired by techniques from source code optimization, two modes,
i.e., interpretation and compilation, are proposed. The interpretation mode
pursues efficient adaption during runtime for cold class skew and the
compilation mode aggressively optimize on hot ones for more efficient
deployment in the future. Aggressive optimization is processed by
class-specific pruning and provides extra benefit. Finally, we design a
systematic framework, SECS, to dynamically detect class skew, processing
interpretation and compilation, as well as select the most accurate
architectures under the runtime resource budget. Extensive evaluations show
that SECS can realize end-to-end classification speedups by a factor of 3x to

crucial for treatment decision support. However, it is challenging to train an
automatic method for predicting the ATR rehabilitation outcome from treatment
data, due to a massive amount of missing entries in the data recorded from ATR
patients, as well as complex nonlinear relations between measurements and
outcomes. In this work, we design an end-to-end probabilistic framework to
impute missing data entries and predict rehabilitation outcomes simultaneously.
We evaluate our model on a real-life ATR clinical cohort, comparing with
various baselines. The proposed method demonstrates its clear superiority over
traditional methods which typically perform imputation and prediction in two
separate stages.
