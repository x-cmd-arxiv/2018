provide a thorough description of the overall catalytic activity, enabling a
deep understanding of the relative importance of every elementary reaction.
Most importantly, we formulate a simple expression to describe accurately the
apparent activation energy of the TOF, valid even when adsorbate-adsorbate

and mimetic properties of diagonal-norm, summation-by-parts, and
simultaneous-approximation-term operators, and is a generalization of previous
works on discontinuous interface coupling [1] and solid wall boundary
conditions [2]. Using the method of lines, a semi-discrete entropy estimate for
the entire domain is obtained when the proposed numerical imposition of
boundary conditions are coupled with an entropy-conservative or entropy-stable
discrete interior operator. The resulting estimate mimics the global entropy
estimate obtained at the continuous level. The boundary data at the wall are
weakly imposed using a penalty flux approach and a
simultaneous-approximation-term technique for both the conservative variables
and the gradient of the entropy variables. Discontinuous spectral collocation
operators (mass lumped nodal discontinuous Galerkin operators), on high-order
unstructured grids, are used for the purpose of demonstrating the robustness
and efficacy of the new procedure for weakly enforcing boundary conditions.
Numerical simulations confirm the non-linear stability of the proposed
technique, with applications to three-dimensional subsonic and supersonic
flows. The procedure described is compatible with any diagonal-norm
summation-by-parts spatial operator, including finite element, finite
difference, finite volume, discontinuous Galerkin, and flux reconstruction
schemes.

giving raise to a combinatorial number of possible biochemical species. The
time-dependent evolution of concentrations of the species is commonly described
by a system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs). However, the
analysis of such high-dimensional, non-linear system of equations is often
computationally expensive and even prohibitive in practice. The major challenge
towards reducing such models is providing the guarantees as to how the solution
of the reduced model relates to that of the original model, while avoiding to
solve the original model. In this paper, we have designed and tested an
approximation method for ODE models of biochemical reaction systems, in which
the guarantees are our major requirement. Borrowing from tropical analysis
techniques, dominance relations among terms of each species' ODE are exploited
to simplify the original model, by neglecting the dominated terms. As the
dominant subsystems can change during the system's dynamics, depending on which
species dominate the others, several possible modes exist. Thus, simpler models
consisting of only the dominant subsystems can be assembled into hybrid,
piecewise smooth models, which approximate the behavior of the initial system.
By combining the detection of dominated terms with symbolic bounds propagation,
we show how to approximate the original model by an assembly of simpler models,
consisting in ordinary differential equations that provide time-dependent lower
and upper bounds for the concentrations of the initial models species. Our
method provides sound interval bounds for the concentrations of the chemical
species, and hence can serve to evaluate the faithfulness of
tropicalization-based reduction heuristics for ODE models of biochemical
reduction systems. The method is tested on several case studies.

stationary jets, where the jet expansion is not associated with net work. Here,
we study jet solutions without them, assuming that adiabatic losses are
balanced by electron reacceleration. The absence of effective adiabatic losses
makes electron advection along the jet an important process, and we solve the
electron kinetic equation including that process. We find analytical solutions
for the case of conical jets with advection and synchrotron losses. We show
that accounting for adiabatic losses in the case of sources showing soft
partially self-absorbed spectra with the spectral index of $\alpha<0$ in the
radio-to-IR regime requires deposition of large amounts of energy at large
distances in the jet. On the other hand, such spectra can be accounted for by
advection of electrons in the jet. We compare our results to the quiescent
spectrum of the blazar Mrk 421. We find its soft radio-IR spectrum can be
fitted either by a model without adiabatic losses and advection of electrons or
by one with adiabatic losses, but the latter requires injection of a very large
power at large distances.

trace-norm $\times$ 1 on the trace-class ideal C 1 (H). In this case the limit

problem naturally arises in the study of nonlocal population dynamics models
defined in a space-time varying environment encoding the influence of a climate
change through a spatial shift of the coefficient. In such models, working
directly in a moving frame that matches the spatial shift leads to consider a
problem where the dispersal of the population is modeled by a nonlocal operator
with a drift term. Assuming that the drift q is a positive function, for rather
general assumptions on J and a, we prove the existence of a principal eigenpair

  Centralized Radio Access Network",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The limited fronthaul capacity imposes a challenge on the uplink of
centralized radio access network (C-RAN). We propose to boost the fronthaul
capacity of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) aided C-RAN by
globally optimizing the power sharing between channel estimation and data
transmission both for the user devices (UDs) and the remote radio units (RRUs).
Intuitively, allocating more power to the channel estimation will result in
more accurate channel estimates, which increases the achievable throughput.
However, increasing the power allocated to the pilot training will reduce the
power assigned to data transmission, which reduces the achievable throughput.
In order to optimize the powers allocated to the pilot training and to the data
transmission of both the UDs and the RRUs, we assign an individual power
sharing factor to each of them and derive an asymptotic closed-form expression
of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise for the massive MIMO aided C-RAN
consisting of both the UD-to-RRU links and the RRU-to-baseband unit (BBU)
links. We then exploit the C-RAN architecture's central computing and control
capability for jointly optimizing the UDs' power sharing factors and the RRUs'
power sharing factors aiming for maximizing the fronthaul capacity. Our
simulation results show that the fronthaul capacity is significantly boosted by
the proposed global optimization of the power allocation between channel
estimation and data transmission both for the UDs and for their host RRUs. As a
specific example of 32 receive antennas (RAs) deployed by RRU and 128 RAs
deployed by BBU, the sum-rate of 10 UDs achieved with the optimal power sharing
factors improves 33\% compared with the one attained without optimizing power

investigate the effect of heterogeneous dislocation density on the transition
between quasi-elastic deformation and plastic flow in face-centered cubic
single crystals. By analyzing the stress-strain curves of samples with an
initial, axial dislocation density gradient, we arrive at the following
conclusions: (i) in the regime of quasi-elastic deformation before the onset of
plastic flow, the effective elastic modulus of the simulated samples falls
significantly below the value for a dislocation-free crystal. This modulus
reduction increases with decreasing dislocation density gradient: crystals with
homogeneous dislocation distribution are thus weakest in the quasi-elastic
regime; (ii) the transition towards plastic flow occurs first in regions of
reduced dislocation density. Therefore, the overall yield stress decreases with
increasing dislocation density gradient; (iii) crystals with dislocation
density gradient exhibit a more pronounced hardening stage during which stress
is re-distributed onto stronger regions with higher dislocation density until
the sample flows at a constant flow stress that is approximately independent on
dislocation density gradient. We interpret these findings in terms of a
continuum dislocation dynamics inspired model of dislocation density evolution
that accounts for inversive dislocation motions. The transition between
quasi-elastic and plastic deformation is interpreted as a transition from
inversive to non-inversive dislocation motion, and the initial differences in
elastic modulus are related to a density dependent polarizability of the
dislocation system. The subsequent plastic flow behavior is analyzed in terms
of a modified version of Mughrabi's composite model.

waves within them, yielding exceptional performance potential. Several
building-block technologies have been implemented and evaluated at the physical
layer. The present work contributes a network-layer scheme to configure such
environments for multiple users and objectives, and for any physical-layer
technology. Supported objectives include any combination of Quality of Service
and power transfer optimization, eavesdropping and Doppler effect mitigation,
in multi-cast or uni-cast settings. Additionally, a graph-based model of
programmable environments is proposed, which incorporates core physical
observations and efficiently separates physical and networking concerns.
Evaluation takes place in a specially developed, free simulation tool, and in a
variety of environments. Performance gains over regular propagation are
highlighted, reaching important insights on the user capacity of programmable

include mixing of WD material into the accreted material in a binary star

0.8-1.35M_sol simulations where 25% of the WD core matter mixes with 75% of the

these five presolar grains, less than 25% of solar system material is required
to be mixed with the CO nova ejecta to account for the grains' compositions.
Thus, our study reports evidence of pure CO nova ejecta material in meteorites.

changing amounts of solar radiation. However, in the upper thermosphere and
exosphere, the neutrals are also subject to ion precipitation. This can
increase the temperature in the region of precipitation, resulting in density
changes that might be seen in in situ data (Fang et al. 2013). Therefore, we
examine neutral density data from the MAVEN Neutral Gas and Ion Mass
Spectrometer (NGIMS) in Mars-Solar-Electric (MSE) coordinates, where location
is determined by the direction of the solar wind convective electric field,
resulting in a hemispherical asymmetry in the ion precipitation. By examining
densities in MSE coordinates (Hara et al. 2013) we are able to look for a
detectable effect in the region where ion precipitation is more likely. Using
the NGIMS neutral data and Key Parameters in situ solar wind data from February
2015 to August 2017 we look for asymmetries by constructing average density
maps in Mars-Solar-Orbital (MSO) and MSE coordinates near the exobase. The
NGIMS densities for O, Ar, and CO2 from 180-220 km altitude for each orbit are
averaged and then binned by location in MSO coordinates and transformed to MSE
coordinates. The resulting MSE map exhibits a small density increase in the
southern hemisphere, where one would expect to see enhanced precipitation.
Although suggestive, the change is not statistically significant, so that the
effect of ion precipitation, thought to be an important driver in the evolution

Revised after the first referee report",,"10.1093/mnras/stz044",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Theoretical modelling and observations of AGN jets suggest that the
non-thermal electrons emitting the observed radiation should (i) carry an
amount of energy comparable to the magnetic fields ($U_e\sim U_B$), which is
likely the case if the magnetic fields play a dynamically important role in the
jet's acceleration process; (ii) cool efficiently in a dynamical time ($t_{\rm
cool}\lesssim t_{\rm dyn}$), which is suggested by the fact that a large
fraction of the jet's kinetic energy is promptly converted into radiation.
These expectations are at odds with the results of the simplest one-zone
Self-Synchro-Compton (SSC) model for the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of
BL Lacs. Indeed, the model predicts $U_e\gg U_B$ and $t_{\rm cool}\gg t_{\rm
dyn}$ for most of the objects. Here we closely investigate one of the key
assumptions of this model, namely that the momentum distribution of the
non-thermal electrons is isotropic. We find that this assumption may be an
oversimplification. If the magnetic energy is dissipated via a turbulent MHD
cascade, the highest energy electrons may instead retain a small pitch angle.
Since the synchrotron emissivity is suppressed when the pitch angle is small,
this effect may importantly affect the modelling of the SED. As an illustrative
example, we present an anisotropic model for the electron momentum distribution
such that $U_e\sim U_B$ and $t_{\rm cool}\lesssim t_{\rm dyn}$ at the same
time. Our model manages to simultaneously solve the two problems with one only
more free parameter with respect to the usual isotropic one-zone SSC model.

frequent repeat purchases are essential since these products are one of the
main drivers of profits. However, buyer purchase patterns are extremely diverse
and sparse on a per-product level due to population heterogeneity as well as
dependence in purchase patterns across product categories. Traditional methods
in survival analysis have proven effective in dealing with censored data by
assuming parametric distributions on inter-arrival times. Distributional
parameters are then fitted, typically in a regression framework. On the other
hand, neural-network based models take a non-parametric approach to learn
relations from a larger functional class. However, the lack of distributional
assumptions make it difficult to model partially observed data. In this paper,
we model directly the inter-arrival times as well as the partially observed
information at each time step in a survival-based approach using Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNN) to model purchase times jointly over several products.
Instead of predicting a point estimate for inter-arrival times, the RNN outputs
parameters that define a distributional estimate. The loss function is the
negative log-likelihood of these parameters given partially observed data. This
approach allows one to leverage both fully observed data as well as partial
information. By externalizing the censoring problem through a log-likelihood
loss function, we show that substantial improvements over state-of-the-art

transformation between sensors. Calibration techniques require correspondence
registration in the measurements which is one of the main challenges in the
extrinsic calibration of heterogeneous sensors, since generally, each sensor

of individual sensors and the calibration is found by aligning these estimates.
Motion-based calibration is the most common approach in the online calibration

robustness as it can detect and adjust recalibration of the system in runtime,

last 25 years. In this approach SFA is a method to solve the TDSE using a
systematic perturbation theory in a part of the Hamiltonian describing
continuum-continuum transitions in the presence of the laser field. In this
review we focus on recent applications of SFA to HHG, ATI and NSMI from
multi-electron atoms and from multi-atom. The main novel part of the presented
theory concerns generalizations of SFA to: (i) time-dependent treatment of
two-electron atoms, allowing for studies of an interplay between Electron
Impact Ionization (EII) and Resonant Excitation with Subsequent Ionization
(RESI); (ii) time-dependent treatment in the single active electron (SAE)
approximation of ""large"" molecules and targets which are themselves undergoing
dynamics during the HHG or ATI process. In particular, we formulate the general
expressions for the case of arbitrary molecules, combining input from quantum
chemistry and quantum dynamics. We formulate also theory of time-dependent
separable molecular potentials to model analytically the dynamics of realistic
electronic wave packets for molecules in strong laser fields.

suspected malicious nodes. In reality, detection is always imperfect, and the
decision about which potentially malicious nodes to remove must trade off false
positives (erroneously removing benign nodes) and false negatives (mistakenly
failing to remove malicious nodes). However, in network settings this
conventional tradeoff must now account for node connectivity. In particular,
malicious nodes may exert malicious influence, so that mistakenly leaving some
of these in the network may cause damage to spread. On the other hand, removing
benign nodes causes direct harm to these, and indirect harm to their benign
neighbors who would wish to communicate with them.
  We formalize the problem of removing potentially malicious nodes from a
network under uncertainty through an objective that takes connectivity into
account. We show that optimally solving the resulting problem is NP-Hard. We
then propose a tractable solution approach based on a convex relaxation of the
objective. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms both a simple baseline that ignores network
structure, as well as a state-of-the-art approach for a related problem, on
both synthetic and real-world datasets.

that a spin-generated magnetic dipole field causes a (slight) bending to the
spacetime around particles, breaking its spherical symmetry. Motivated by the
apparent break of spherical symmetry, we propose a very general gedanken
experiment that does not rely on any specific theory of classical or quantum
gravity, and analyze this gedanken experiment in the context of quantum
information. We show that any spin-related deviation from spherical symmetry
would violate relativistic causality. To avoid the violation of causality, the
measurable spacetime around the particle's rest frame must remain spherically
symmetric, potentially as a back-action by the act of measurement. This way,
our gedanken experiment proves that there must be a censorship mechanism
preventing the possibility of spacetime-based spin detection, which sheds new
light on the interface between quantum mechanics and gravity. We emphasize that
our proposed gedanken experiment is independent of any theory and by allowing
spacetime to be quantized its purpose is to be used for testing present and
future candidate theories of quantum gravity.

the millimeter-to-centimeter large footprint of many foundry-ready photonic
electro-optic modulators significantly limits scaling density. Furthermore,
modulators bear a fundamental a frequency-response to energy-sensitive
trade-off, a limitation that can be overcome with coupling-based modulators
where the temporal response speed is decoupled from the optical cavity photo
lifetime. Thus, the coupling effect to the resonator is modulated rather then
tuning the index of the resonator itself. However, the weak electro-optic
response of silicon limits such coupling modulator performance, since the
micrometer-short overlap region of the waveguide-bus and a microring resonator
is insufficient to induce signal modulation. To address these limitations, here
we demonstrate a coupling-controlled electro-optic modulator by heterogeneously
integrating a dual-gated indium-tin-oxide (ITO) phase shifter placed at the
silicon microring-bus coupler region. Our experimental modulator shows about 4
dB extinction ratio on resonance, and a about 1.5 dB off resonance with a low
insertion loss of 0.15 dB for a just 4 {\mu}m short device demonstrating a
compact high 10:1 modulation-to-loss ratio. In conclusion we demonstrate a

component analysis (RPCA), where the goal is to recover the dominant
non-negative principal components of a data matrix precisely, where a number of
measurements could be grossly corrupted with sparse and arbitrary large noise.
Most of the known techniques for solving the RPCA rely on convex relaxation
methods by lifting the problem to a higher dimension, which significantly
increase the number of variables. As an alternative, the well-known
Burer-Monteiro approach can be used to cast the RPCA as a non-convex and
non-smooth $\ell_1$ optimization problem with a significantly smaller number of
variables. In this work, we show that the low-dimensional formulation of the
symmetric and asymmetric positive rank-1 RPCA based on the Burer-Monteiro
approach has benign landscape, i.e., 1) it does not have any spurious local
solution, 2) has a unique global solution, and 3) its unique global solution
coincides with the true components. An implication of this result is that
simple local search algorithms are guaranteed to achieve a zero global
optimality gap when directly applied to the low-dimensional formulation.
Furthermore, we provide strong deterministic and probabilistic guarantees for
the exact recovery of the true principal components. In particular, it is shown

sequencer reads is dependent on the proper choice of its configuration
parameters, such as the value of k in k-mer based techniques. In this work, we
target the problem of finding the best values of these configuration parameters
to optimize error correction. We perform this in a data-driven manner, due to
the observation that different configuration parameters are optimal for
different datasets, i.e., from different instruments and organisms. We use
language modeling techniques from the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain
in our algorithmic suite, Athena, to automatically tune the
performance-sensitive configuration parameters. Through the use of N-Gram and
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) language modeling, we validate the intuition
that the EC performance can be computed quantitatively and efficiently using
the perplexity metric, prevalent in NLP. After training the language model, we
show that the perplexity metric calculated for runtime data has a strong
negative correlation with the correction of the erroneous NGS reads. Therefore,
we use the perplexity metric to guide a hill climbing-based search, converging
toward the best $k$-value. Our approach is suitable for both de novo and
comparative sequencing (resequencing), eliminating the need for a reference
genome to serve as the ground truth. This is important because the use of a
reference genome often carries forward the biases along the stages of the
pipeline.

characteristics which testing techniques are built upon, and need to be
continuously improved to deliver useful solutions for researchers and
practitioners, and community as a whole.
  Objective. In this systematic review, we attempt to provide a broad picture
of existing mobile testing tools by collating and analysing their conceptual,
and also performance characteristics including an estimation of effectiveness,
efficiency, and practicality. Method. To achieve our objective, we specify 3
primary, and 14 secondary review questions, and conducted an analysis of 25
primary studies. We first individually analyse each primary study, and next
analyse the primary studies as a whole. We developed a review protocol which
defines all the details of our systematic review.
  Results. From effectiveness, we conclude that testing techniques which
implement model-checking, symbolic execution, constraint solving, and
search-based test generation approach tend to be more effective than those
implementing random test generation. From efficiency, we conclude that testing
techniques which implement code search-based testing approaches tend to be more
efficient than those implementing GUI model-based. From practicality, we
conclude that the more effective a testing technique is, the less efficient it
will be.
  Conclusion. For effectiveness, we observe that the existing automated testing
techniques are not effective enough, and currently they achieve nearly half of
the desired level of effectiveness. For efficiency, we observe that current
automated testing techniques are not efficient enough.

learning (ML) algorithms. In-memory acceleration has potential to address this
problem; however, it needs to address two challenges. First, in-memory
accelerator should be general enough to support a large set of different ML
algorithms. Second, it should be efficient enough to utilize bandwidth while
meeting limited power and area budgets of logic layer of a 3D-stacked memory.
We observe that previous work fails to simultaneously address both challenges.
We propose ORIGAMI, a heterogeneous set of in-memory accelerators, to support
compute demands of different ML algorithms, and also uses an off-the-shelf
compute platform (e.g.,FPGA,GPU,TPU,etc.) to utilize bandwidth without
violating strict area and power budgets. ORIGAMI offers a pattern-matching
technique to identify similar computation patterns of ML algorithms and
extracts a compute engine for each pattern. These compute engines constitute
heterogeneous accelerators integrated on logic layer of a 3D-stacked memory.
Combination of these compute engines can execute any type of ML algorithms. To
utilize available bandwidth without violating area and power budgets of logic
layer, ORIGAMI comes with a computation-splitting compiler that divides an ML
algorithm between in-memory accelerators and an out-of-the-memory platform in a
balanced way and with minimum inter-communications. Combination of pattern
matching and split execution offers a new design point for acceleration of ML
algorithms. Evaluation results across 12 popular ML algorithms show that
ORIGAMI outperforms state-of-the-art accelerator with 3D-stacked memory in
terms of performance and energy-delay product (EDP) by 1.5x and 29x (up to 1.6x

an application of these results, we deduce that the $\ast$-algebraic,

preserving vacuum expectation values (vev's) get mapped to distinct but
degenerate set of vev's under action of $D$ parity, leading to formation of
domain walls as topological pseudo-defects. The metastability of such walls can
make them relatively long lived and contradict standard cosmology. Thus we are
led to consider adding a nonrenormalisable Planck scale suppressed operator,
that breaks $\mathrm{SO}(10)$ symmetry but preserves Standard Model symmetry.
For a large range of right handed breaking scales $M_R$, this is shown to give
rise to the required pressure difference to remove the domain walls without
conflicting with consistent big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) while avoiding
gravitino overproduction. However, if the walls persist till the onset of weak

uncertainties in measurements of the fine structure constant. Estimating the
magnetic field strength is thus essential in this context. Here we model the
absorption profiles of a large number of atomic transitions in the white dwarf

equipped with an external memory, and are reported to be effective for tasks
requiring a large long-term memory and its selective use. The core module of a
MANN is called a controller, which is usually implemented as a recurrent neural
network (RNN) (e.g., LSTM) to enable the use of contextual information in
controlling the other modules. However, such an RNN-based controller often
allows a MANN to directly solve the given task by using the (small) internal
memory of the controller, and prevents the MANN from making the best use of the
external memory, thereby resulting in a suboptimally trained model. To address
this problem, we present a novel type of RNN-based controller that is partially
non-recurrent and avoids the direct use of its internal memory for solving the
task, while keeping the ability of using contextual information in controlling
the other modules. Our empirical experiments using Neural Turing Machines and
Differentiable Neural Computers on the Toy and bAbI tasks demonstrate that the
proposed controllers give substantially better results than standard RNN-based
controllers.

  (Extended Version)","This is an extended version of a submission to IEEE journal",,,,"cs.IT cs.LG math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The popularity of mobile devices results in the availability of enormous data
and computational resources at the network edge. To leverage the data and
resources, a new machine learning paradigm, called edge learning, has emerged
where learning algorithms are deployed at the edge for providing fast and
intelligent services to mobile users. While computing speeds are advancing
rapidly, the communication latency is becoming the bottleneck of fast edge
learning. To address this issue, this work is focused on designing a low
latency multi-access scheme for edge learning. We consider a popular framework,
federated edge learning (FEEL), where edge-server and on-device learning are
synchronized to train a model without violating user-data privacy. It is
proposed that model updates simultaneously transmitted by devices over
broadband channels should be analog aggregated ""over-the-air"" by exploiting the
superposition property of a multi-access channel. Thereby, ""interference"" is
harnessed to provide fast implementation of the model aggregation. This results
in dramatical latency reduction compared with the traditional orthogonal access
(i.e., OFDMA). In this work, the performance of FEEL is characterized targeting
a single-cell random network. First, due to power alignment between devices as
required for aggregation, a fundamental tradeoff is shown to exist between the
update-reliability and the expected update-truncation ratio. This motivates the
design of an opportunistic scheduling scheme for FEEL that selects devices
within a distance threshold. This scheme is shown using real datasets to yield
satisfactory learning performance in the presence of high mobility. Second,
both the multi-access latency of the proposed analog aggregation and the OFDMA
scheme are analyzed. Their ratio, which quantifies the latency reduction of the
former, is proved to scale almost linearly with device population.

those for which cancellation happens between a pre-existing large magnetic
feature of one polarity and a smaller feature of the other polarity that
emerged/appeared nearby. For Class II events cancellations occur between two
pre-existing, previously unconnected features that converge toward each other.
All studied events have an apparent cancellation time less than 10 minutes and
display a significant transient linear polarization signal along the polarity
inversion line. The cancellation events are characterized by a flux decay rate
of about 10$^{15}$~Mx s$^{-1}$. Horizontal convergence speeds of Class II pairs
fall between 0.3 and 1.22~km s$^{-1}$. The elements often do not converge
directly towards each other, so that the proper motion speeds of the individual
elements is higher, in the range of 1 - 2.7~km s$^{-1}$. We propose that these
cancellation events result from either field-line submergence (Class I), or
reconnection followed by submergence (Class II and/or Class I). Ohmic
dissipation of magnetic energy could also play a role for both classes. We
propose that, at least for the Class II events, the granular motions could
possibly be driving magnetic reconnection, rather than the supergranular
motions proposed for the larger cancellation events studied earlier. Specific
flux cancellation rates of the Class II events seem to indicate that they
belong to somewhat different category of cancellations when compared with those
studied in SOT/Hinode and MDI/SOHO data.

to overcome this limitation. The method uses passive filling and pinning of an
oil phase in hydrophobic channels to encapsulate electrokinetically separated
and focused analytes with a brief pressure pulse. The resulting encapsulated
sample droplet maintains its concentration over long periods of time without
requiring an electric field and can be manipulated for further analysis, either
on- or off- chip. We demonstrate the method by encapsulating DNA
oligonucleotides in a 240 pL aqueous segment after isotachophoresis (ITP)
focusing, and show that the concentration remains at 60% of the initial value
for tens of minutes, a 22-fold increase over free diffusion after 20 minutes.
Furthermore, we demonstrate manipulation of a single droplet by selectively
encapsulating amplicon after ITP purification from a polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) mix, and performing parallel off-chip detection reactions using the
droplet. We provide geometrical design guidelines for devices implementing the
encapsulation method, and show how the method can be scaled to multiple analyte

optimization method with use of the neural network. For theories with the sign
problem, integral in the complexified variable space is a promising approach to
obtain a finite (non-zero) average phase factor. In the path optimization
method, the imaginary part of variables are given as functions of the real
part, $y_i=y_i(\{x\})$, and are optimized to enhance the average phase factor.
The feedforward neural network can be used to give and to optimize functions
with many variables. The combined framework, the path optimization with use of
the neural network, is applied to the complex $\phi^4$ theory at finite
density, the 0+1 dimensional QCD at finite density, and the Polyakov loop
extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model, all of which have the sign problem.
In these cases, the average phase factor is found to be enhanced significantly.
In the complex $\phi^4$ theory, it is demonstrated that the number density is
calculated at a high precision. On the optimized path, the imaginary part is
found to have strong correlation with the real part on the temporal nearest
neighbor site. In the 0+1 dimensional QCD, we compare the results in two
different treatments of the link variable: optimization after the diagonal
gauge fixing and optimization without the diagonal gauge fixing. These two
methods show consistent eigenvalue distribution of the link variables. In the
PNJL model with homogeneous field ansatz, finite volume results approach the
mean field results as expected, and the phase transition behavior can be
described.

multigrid-reduction-in-time (MGRIT) as a generalization of previous two-grid
estimates. The framework provides a priori upper bounds on the convergence of
MGRIT V- and F-cycles, with different relaxation schemes, by deriving the
respective residual and error propagation operators. The residual and error
operators are functions of the time stepping operator, analyzed directly and
bounded in norm, both numerically and analytically. We present various upper
bounds of different computational cost and varying sharpness. These upper
bounds are complemented by proposing analytic formulae for the approximate
convergence factor of V-cycle algorithms that take the number of fine grid time
points, the temporal coarsening factors, and the eigenvalues of the time
stepping operator as parameters.
  The paper concludes with supporting numerical investigations of parabolic
(anisotropic diffusion) and hyperbolic (wave equation) model problems. We
assess the sharpness of the bounds and the quality of the approximate
convergence factors. Observations from these numerical investigations
demonstrate the value of the proposed multilevel convergence framework for
estimating MGRIT convergence a priori and for the design of a convergent
algorithm. We further highlight that observations in the literature are
captured by the theory, including that two-level Parareal and multilevel MGRIT
with F-relaxation do not yield scalable algorithms and the benefit of a
stronger relaxation scheme. An important observation is that with increasing
numbers of levels MGRIT convergence deteriorates for the hyperbolic model
problem, while constant convergence factors can be achieved for the diffusion
equation. The theory also indicates that L-stable Runge-Kutta schemes are more
amendable to multilevel parallel-in-time integration with MGRIT than A-stable
Runge-Kutta schemes.

mechanism for the onset of substorm and current disruption initiation in the
near-Earth magnetotail. Yet the stability of the kinetic ballooning mode (KBM)
in a global and realistic magnetotail configuration has not been well examined.
In this paper, the growth rate of the KBM is calculated from analytical theory
for the two-dimensional Voigt equilibrium within the framework of kinetic
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model. The growth rate of the KBM is found to be
strongly dependent on the field line stiffening factor $S$, which depends on
the trapped electron dynamics, the finite ion gyroradius, and the magnetic
drift motion of charged particles. Furthermore, calculations show that the KBM
is unstable in a finite intermediate range of equatorial $\beta_{eq}$ values
and the growth rate dependence on $\beta_{eq}$ is enhanced for larger $\rho_i$.
The KBM stability is further analyzed in a broad range of $k_y$ for different
values of ion Larmor radius $\rho_i$ and gradient ratio $\eta_j \equiv
d\ln(T_j)/d\ln(n_j)$, where $T_j$ is the particle temperature and $n_j$ is the
particle density. The KBM is found to be unstable for sufficiently high values
of $k_y$, where the growth rate first increases to a maximum value and then
decreases due to kinetic effects. The $k_y$ at the maximum growth rate
decreases exponentially with $\rho_i$. The current sheet thinning is found to
enhance the KBM growth rate and the unstable $\beta_{eq}$ regime in the
near-Earth magnetotail.

presented. The latter is also viewed as a normal form result for multiple-input

nonlinear symmetry transformations associated with the nonlinear symmetry group
of the simplest normal forms. Symbolic normal form transformation generators
are derived for computer algebra implementation. Further, the results are
efficiently implemented and verified using Maple for all three types of normal

This first model-independent mass for a directly imaged planet is inconsistent
with cold-start models given the age of the $\beta$ Pic moving group $(22\pm6$

We find a higher eccentricity $(0.24\pm0.06)$ for $\beta$ Pic b compared to
previous orbital fits. If confirmed by future observations, this eccentricity
may help explain inner edge, scale height, and brightness asymmetry of $\beta$
Pic's disk. It could also potentially signal that $\beta$ Pic b has migrated
inward to its current location, acquiring its eccentricity from interaction

of convergence to consensus of multi-agent networks is critical to ensure
cohesive, rapid response to external stimuli. The challenge is that increasing
the rate of convergence can require changes in the network connectivity, which
might not be always feasible. Note that current consensus-seeking control laws
can be considered as a gradient-based search over the graph's Laplacian
potential. The main contribution of this article is to improve the convergence
to consensus, by using an accelerated gradient-based search approach.
Additionally, this work shows that the accelerated-consensus approach can be
implemented in a distributed manner, where each agent applies a delayed self
reinforcement, without the need for additional network information or changes
to the network connectivity. Simulation results of an example networked system
are presented in this work to show that the proposed accelerated-consensus
approach with DSR can substantially improve synchronization during the
transition by about ten times, in addition to decreasing the transition time by
about half, when compared to the case without the DSR approach. This is shown
to improve formation control during transitions in networked multi-agent

homogeneous magnetic field $\alpha(\sigma, 0, 1)$. We consider the inviscid,
ideal conductor limit $\textbf{Re}^{-1}$, $\textbf{R}_m^{-1} \ll 1$ and prove
that for strong and suitably oriented background fields the Couette flow is
asymptotically stable to perturbations small in the Sobolev space $H^N$. More
precisely, we show that if $\alpha$ and $N$ are sufficiently large, $\sigma \in
\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$ satisfies a generic Diophantine condition, and
the initial perturbations $u_{in}$ and $b_{in}$ to the Couette flow and
magnetic field, respectively, satisfy $\|(u_{in},b_{in})\|_{H^N} = \epsilon \ll
\textbf{Re}^{-1}$, then the resulting solution to the 3D MHD equations is
global in time and the perturbation $(u(t,x+yt,y,z),b(t,x+yt,y,z))$ remains
$\mathcal{O}(\textbf{Re}^{-1})$ in $H^{N'}$ for some $N'(\sigma) < N$. Our
proof establishes enhanced dissipation estimates describing the decay of the
$x$-dependent modes on the timescale $t \sim \textbf{Re}^{1/3}$, as well as
inviscid damping of the velocity and magnetic field that agrees with the
optimal decay rate for the linearized system. In the Navier-Stokes case, high
regularity control on the perturbation in a coordinate system adapted to the
mixing of the Couette flow is known only under the stronger assumption
$\epsilon \ll \textbf{Re}^{-3/2}$. The improvement in the MHD setting is
possible because the magnetic field induces time oscillations that partially
suppress the lift-up effect, which is the primary transient growth mechanism
for the Navier-Stokes equations linearized around the Couette flow.

  humidity on the climate",,,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we derive a new formula for the global temperature change and
major feedback portions in the climate response. In our earlier paper we
calculated from the experimental values the sensitivity about ${\rm
0.058~K/(W/m^2)}$. This means the negative feedback which reduced the
sensitivity by factor $2.13$. In this paper we explain and derive the major
portions in the feedback coefficient using the observed energy budget at the
top of the climate and on the surface of the earth. The results also support
strongly our earlier results of the low climate sensitivity ($\Delta T_{\rm
2CO_2}\approx 0.24^{\circ}$C). The major portions in the negative feedback
coefficient in shortwave insolation are roughly clouds $63\%$, evaporation
cooling $28\%$, and water vapour $9\%$. The new sensitivity is ${\rm
0.0605~K/(W/m^2)}$ which is reduced by factor $2.00$. The changes in cloud
cover or in the relative humidity explain almost all the global temperature
changes. The result is confirmed with experimental observations. On the other
hand, the sun and the change in the vegetation are probably controlling most of
the changes in cloudiness and humidity.

Transfer Learning (TL) setting to leverage labeled data from a resource-rich
source domain. To achieve better performance, source domain data selection is
essential in this process to prevent the ""negative transfer"" problem. However,
the emerging deep transfer models do not fit well with most existing data
selection methods, because the data selection policy and the transfer learning
model are not jointly trained, leading to sub-optimal training efficiency.
  In this paper, we propose a novel reinforced data selector to select
high-quality source domain data to help the TL model. Specifically, the data
selector ""acts"" on the source domain data to find a subset for optimization of
the TL model, and the performance of the TL model can provide ""rewards"" in turn
to update the selector. We build the reinforced data selector based on the
actor-critic framework and integrate it to a DNN based transfer learning model,
resulting in a Reinforced Transfer Learning (RTL) method. We perform a thorough
experimental evaluation on two major tasks for text matching, namely,
paraphrase identification and natural language inference. Experimental results
show the proposed RTL can significantly improve the performance of the TL
model. We further investigate different settings of states, rewards, and policy
optimization methods to examine the robustness of our method. Last, we conduct
a case study on the selected data and find our method is able to select source
domain data whose Wasserstein distance is close to the target domain data. This
is reasonable and intuitive as such source domain data can provide more
transferability power to the model.

in the presence of a Deutschian closed timelike curve (D-CTC), one could
violate the Holevo bound. It is possible to utilize the Holevo bound violation
to encode $n$-bit classical information in a single qubit. Here we demonstrate
a new quantum cost efficient scheme, for storing and retrieving $n$-bit
classical information faithfully in the presence of a D-CTC in violation of the
Holevo bound. We also propose a new protocol for cloning a qubit in the
presence of a D-CTC. In both the schemes, the quantum cost is found to be of
order $O(n)$, which provides an advantage over the existing schemes having
quantum cost of exponential order.

matter scenario made of multiple electronic components, and competing quantum
phases is needed to grab the key physics of high critical temperature (Tc)
superconductivity in layered cuprates. While it is known that defects
self-organization controls Tc, the mechanism remains an open issue. Here we
focus on the theoretical prediction of the multi-band electronic structure and
the formation of broken Fermi surfaces generated by the self-organization of
oxygen interstitials O-i atomic wires in the spacer layers in HgBa2CuO4+y,
La2CuO4+y and La2NiO4+y, by means of self-consistent Linear Muffin-Tin Orbital
(LMTO) calculations. The electronic structure of a first phase of ordered O-i
atomic wires and of a second glassy phase made of disordered O-i impurities
have been studied through supercell calculations. We show the common features
of the influence of O-i wires in the electronic structure in three type of
materials. The ordering of O-i into wires lead to a separation of the
electronic states between the O-i ensemble and the rest of the bulk. The wires
formation produce first quantum confined localized states near the wire which
coexist with second delocalized states in the Fermi-surface (FS) of doped
cuprates. In this new scenario for high Tc superconductivity, Kitaev wires with
Majorana bound states are proximity-coupled to a 2D d-wave superconductor in
cuprates.

  scanning probes",,,,,"physics.app-ph physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objective: We aim to improve operational robustness of liquid scanning
probes. Two main failure modes to be addressed are an obstruction of the flow
path of the processing liquid and a deviation from the desired gap distance
between probe and sample. Methods: We introduce a multi-functional design
element, a microfluidic bypass channel, which can be operated in dc and in ac
mode, each preventing one of the two main failure modes. Results: In dc mode,
the bypass channel is filled with liquid and exhibits resistive behavior,
enabling the probe to passively react to an obstruction. In the case of an
obstruction of the flow path, the processing liquid is passively diverted
through the bypass to prevent its leakage and to limit the build-up of high
pressure levels. In ac mode, the bypass is filled with gas and has capacitive
characteristics, allowing the gap distance between the probe and the sample to
be monitored by observing a phase shift in the motion of two gas-liquid
interfaces. For a modulation of the input pressure at 4 Hz, significant changes
of the phase shift were observed up to a gap distance of 25 {\mu}m. Conclusion:
The presented passive design element counters both failure modes in a simple
and highly compatible manner. Significance: Liquid scanning probes enabling
targeted interfacing with biological surfaces are compatible with a wide range
of workflows and bioanalytical applications. An improved operational robustness
would facilitate rapid and widespread adoption of liquid scanning probes in
research as well as in diagnostics.

overcome the energy and performance challenges in computationally demanding
applications. If the case where the accuracy can be configured, the quality
level versus energy efficiency or delay also may be traded-off. For this
technique to be used, one needs to make sure a satisfactory user experience.
This requires employing error predictors to detect unacceptable approximation
errors. In this work, we propose a scheduling-aware feature selection method
which leverages the intermediate results of the hardware accelerator to improve
the prediction accuracy. Additionally, it configures the error predictors
according to the energy consumption and latency of the system. The approach
enjoys the flexibility of the prediction time for a higher accuracy. The
results on various benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in the
prediction accuracy compared to the prior works which used only the accelerator
inputs for the prediction.

scheme upon which access to the shared medium is regulated in many wireless
networks. With CSMA/CA a station willing to start a transmission has first to
find the channel free for a given duration otherwise it will go into
\emph{backoff}, i.e. refraining for transmitting for a randomly chosen delay.
Performance analysis of a wireless network employing CSMA/CA regulation is not
an easy task: except for simple network configuration analytical solution of
key performance indicators (KPI) cannot be obtained hence one has to resort to
formal modelling tools. In this paper we present a performance modelling study
targeting different kind of CSMA/CA based wireless networks, namely: the IEEE
802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) and the 802.11p Vehicular Ad Hoc
Networks (VANETs), which extends 802.11 with priorities over packets. The
modelling framework we introduce allows for considering: i) an arbitrarily
large number of stations, ii) different traffic conditions
(saturated/non-saturated), iii) different hypothesis concerning the shared
channel (ideal/non-ideal). We apply statistical model checking to assess KPIs
of different network configurations.

nanoporous alumina is a cylindrically anisotropic as well as a radially
inhomogeneous optical medium. Detailed structural characterization reveals that
the nanopore diameter varies linearly with the radius of the aluminium
microwire along the radial direction. Microcracks form on the alumina shell
during the anodization when sufficient thickness is formed due to volume
expansion and stress accumulation. The formation of the microcracks can be
monitored by the anodization current which shows sudden jumps when the cracks
are formed. After removing the remaining aluminium at the core of the anodised
wire the anisotropic and inhomogeneous alumina microtube is obtained. Such
nanoporous alumina microtubes form unique optical waveguides and are useful for
microscale heat transfer applications.

devices, where only a small region is dedicated to antenna design, and base
stations, where design space is not shared with other components. Both imply
different restrictions on what performance is realizable. In this paper
properties of both ends of the spectrum in terms of MIMO performance is
investigated. For electrically small antennas the size restriction dominates
the performance parameters. The regions dedicated to antenna design induce
currents on the rest of the device. Here a method for studying fundamental
bound on spectral efficiency of such configurations is presented. This bound is
also studied for $N$-degree MIMO systems. For electrically large structures the
number of degrees of freedom available per unit area is investigated for
different shapes. Both of these are achieved by formulating a convex
optimization problem for maximum spectral efficiency in the current density on
the antenna. A computationally efficient solution for this problem is
formulated and investigated in relation to constraining parameters, such as
