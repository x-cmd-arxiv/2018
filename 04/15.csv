In order
to identify the `cavity' electrons, we use maximally-localized Wannier
functions and `empty atom' technique. The estimation of magnetic coupling is
then performed based on magnetic force linear response theory. Both short- and
long-range magnetic interactions are calculated with a single self-consistent
calculation of a primitive cell. With this scheme we investigate four different
organic electrides whose magnetic properties have been partly unknown or under

work not only provides useful insight to understand magnetic electrides but
also suggests a new paradigm to study the related materials.

formation of massive galaxies. If merging is a non-negligible factor in the
growth of our Galaxy, evidence of such events should be encoded in its stellar
halo. Reliable identification of genuine halo stars is a challenging task
however. The 1st Gaia data release contains the positions, parallaxes and
proper motions for over 2 million stars, mostly in the Solar neighbourhood.
Gaia DR2 will enlarge this sample to over 1.5 billion stars, the brightest ~5
million of which will have a full phase-space information. Our aim is to
develop a machine learning model to reliably identify halo stars, even when
their full phase-space information is not available. We use the Gradient
Boosted Trees algorithm to build a supervised halo star classifier. The
classifier is trained on a sample extracted from the Gaia Universe Model
Snapshot, convolved with the errors of TGAS, as well as with the expected
uncertainties of the upcoming Gaia DR2. We also trained our classifier on the
cross-match between the TGAS and RAVE catalogues, where the halo stars are
labelled in an entirely model independent way. We then use this model to
identify halo stars in TGAS. When full phase- space information is available
and for Gaia DR2-like uncertainties, our classifier is able to recover 90% of
the halo stars with at most 30% distance errors, in a completely unseen test
set, and with negligible levels of contamination. When line-of-sight velocity
is not available, we recover ~60% of such halo stars, with less than 10%
contamination. When applied to the TGAS data, our classifier detects 337 high
confidence RGB halo stars. Although small, this number is consistent with the
expectation from models given the data uncertainties. The large parallax errors
are the biggest limitation to identify a larger number of halo stars in all the
cases studied.

unrestricted summoning tasks and the necessary conditions for specific types of

impossibility of cloning devices can be derived from the impossibility of
superluminal signalling and the projection postulate, together with assumptions
about the devices' location-independent functioning. In this qualified sense,
known summoning results follow from the causal structure of space-time and the

secure against some classes of post-quantum but non-signalling adversaries.

sparseness} -- the lack of feature overlap between a trained model and a test

classifiers trained for predicting missing features in a given instance, to
overcome the feature sparseness problem. Using a set of unlabeled training
instances, we first learn binary classifiers as feature predictors for
predicting whether a particular feature occurs in a given instance. Next, each
feature predictor is represented as a vertex $v_i$ in the ClassiNet where a
one-to-one correspondence exists between feature predictors and vertices. The
weight of the directed edge $e_{ij}$ connecting a vertex $v_i$ to a vertex
$v_j$ represents the conditional probability that given $v_i$ exists in an

generalize word co-occurrence graphs by considering implicit co-occurrences
between features. We extract numerous features from the trained ClassiNet to
overcome feature sparseness. In particular, for a given instance $\vec{x}$, we
find similar features from ClassiNet that did not appear in $\vec{x}$, and
append those features in the representation of $\vec{x}$. Moreover, we propose
a method based on graph propagation to find features that are indirectly
related to a given short-text. We evaluate ClassiNets on several benchmark
datasets for short-text classification. Our experimental results show that by

breaking of symmetry, considering the nano particles are half or less than half
immersed in an inhomogeneous dielectric background, i.e. at air-water
interface. Such reversals have been explained based on Fano resonance,
interference fields, unusual behavior of optical Lorentz force and image charge
theory. However, if the dimer set is placed over a dielectric interface or
fully inside a homogeneous medium, the sign of binding force does not reverse.
Our proposed configuration provides a generic mechanism of archiving binding
force reversal for both plasmonic and dielectric objects, which can be verified
by very simple experimental set-up.

necessary for proper function in neural networks. However, in principle, such
balance could be achieved by many possible configurations of excitatory and
inhibitory strengths, and relative numbers of excitatory and inhibitory
neurons. For instance, a given level of excitation could be balanced by either
numerous inhibitory neurons with weak synapses, or few inhibitory neurons with
strong synapses. Among the continuum of different but balanced configurations,
why should any particular configuration be favored? Here we address this
question in the context of the entropy of network dynamics by studying an
analytically tractable network of binary neurons. We find that entropy is
highest at the boundary between excitation-dominant and inhibition-dominant
regimes. Entropy also varies along this boundary with a trade-off between high
and robust entropy: weak synapse strengths yield high network entropy which is
fragile to parameter variations, while strong synapse strengths yield a lower,
but more robust, network entropy. In the case where inhibitory and excitatory
synapses are constrained to have similar strength, we find that a small, but
non-zero fraction of inhibitory neurons, like that seen in mammalian cortex,
results in robust and relatively high entropy.

the behaviour of the 12-bit fixed-point arithmetic when training a
convolutional neural network with the CIFAR-10 dataset is analysed, showing
that such arithmetic is not the most appropriate for the training phase. After
that, the paper presents and evaluates, under the same conditions, alternative
low-precision arithmetics, starting with the 12-bit floating-point arithmetic.
These two representations are then leveraged using local scaling in order to
increase accuracy and get closer to the baseline 32-bit floating-point
arithmetic. Finally, the paper introduces a simplified model in which both the
outputs and the gradients of the neural networks are constrained to
power-of-two values, just using 7 bits for their representation. The evaluation
demonstrates a minimal loss in accuracy for the proposed Power-of-Two neural
network, avoiding the use of multiplications and divisions and thereby,
significantly reducing the training time as well as the energy consumption and
memory requirements during the training and inference phases.

  Push-forward operators form one important class of examples of transfunctions

transfunctions are a generalization of measurable functions between measurable
spaces. Additionally, there are naturally arising transfunctions with nice
properties which are not measurable functions.
  Transfunctions which are weakly $\sigma$-additive (commutable with addition
over countable sequences of orthogonal measures) between second-countable
metric spaces are of particular interest and are primarily developed in this
paper. We study such transfunctions which are localized: sending source
measures carried by small open sets to target measures also carried by small
open sets.
  With the right settings and assumptions, we develop some theorems which
characterize continuous functions and measurable functions, and show that the
behavior of localized transfunctions can be approximated by measurable
functions and by continuous functions, but only up to some error. We also
characterize transfunctions that correspond to Markov operators.
  In our investigation of transfunctions we are motivated by several potential
applications, including Monge-Kantorovich transportation problem or population
dynamics that will be presented in some detail in this paper.

Following the line of work initiated by Hayes for sofic entropy, we show in a
certain precise manner that all positive entropy must come from portions of the
Koopman representation that embed into the left-regular representation. By
combining this result with the generalized factor theorem of the previous

the Koopman representation must be isomorphic to the countable direct sum of
the left-regular representation. This generalizes a theorem of Dooley--Golodets

generic occurrence of QAR in quantum systems. The vicinity of QAR is shown to
correspond semiclassically to SWC. A global spectral manifestation of SWC is
the fact that a scaled QE spectrum as function of $\hbar_{\rm s}$, at fixed
small value of $\kappa /\hbar_{\rm s}$, features an approximately ""doubled""
structure. In the case of standard (cosine) potentials, this structure is that
of a universal (parameters-independent) double Hofstadter butterfly. Also, for
standard potentials and for small $\hbar_{\rm s}$ (semiclassical regime), the
evolution of the kinetic-energy expectation value exhibits a relatively slow
quantum-diffusive behavior having universal features. These approximate
spectral and quantum-dynamical universalities agree with predictions from the

fragment as an anchor or target. Ideally, anchors provide good starting points
for navigation, and targets supplement anchors with additional details while
not distracting users with irrelevant, false and redundant information. The
problem is not trivial for intertwining relationship between data
characteristics and user expectation. Imagine that in a large dataset, there
are clusters of fragments spreading over the feature space. The nature of each
cluster can be described by its size (implying popularity) and structure
(implying complexity). A principle way of hyperlinking can be carried out by
picking centers of clusters as anchors and from there reach out to targets
within or outside of clusters with consideration of neighborhood complexity.
The question is which fragments should be selected either as anchors or
targets, in one way to reflect the rich content of a dataset, and meanwhile to
minimize the risk of frustrating user experience. This paper provides some
insights to this question from the perspective of hubness and local intrinsic

adapt a previously described demonstration-based learning algorithm to
synthesize a control funnel function as well as the associated feedback law. We
implement this law on top of a 1/8th scale autonomous vehicle called the

on-road safety in tomorrow's smart cities. Vehicles in an autonomous platoon
can exploit vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications to collect information,
such as velocity and acceleration, from surrounding vehicles so as to maintain
the target velocity and inter-vehicle distance. However, due to the dynamic
on-vehicle data processing rate and the uncertainty of the wireless channel,
V2V communications within a platoon will experience a delay. Such delay can
impair the vehicles' ability to stabilize the operation of the platoon. In this
paper, a novel framework is proposed to optimize a platoon's operation while
jointly consider the delay of the wireless network and the stability of the
vehicle's control system. First, stability analysis for the control system is
performed and the maximum wireless system delay requirements which can prevent
the instability of the control system are derived. Then, delay analysis is
conducted to determine the end-to-end delay, including queuing, processing, and
transmission delay for the V2V link in the wireless network. Subsequently,
using the derived delay, a lower bound and an approximated expression of the
reliability for the wireless system, defined as the probability that the
wireless system meets the control system's delay needs, are derived. Then, the
control parameters are optimized to maximize the derived wireless system
reliability. Simulation results corroborate the analytical derivations and
study the impact of parameters, such as the platoon size, on the reliability
performance of the vehicular platoon. More importantly, the simulation results
disclose the benefits of integrating control system and wireless network design
while providing guidelines for designing autonomous platoons so as to realize
the required wireless network reliability and control system stability.

abilities by utilizing a semantic concept space. A concept space is a
high-dimensional semantic space in which similar abstract concepts appear close

one-shot learning that builds on this idea. Our approach learns to map a novel
sample instance to a concept, relates that concept to the existing ones in the

to help learning. Instead of synthesizing new image instance, we propose to
directly synthesize instance features by leveraging semantics using a novel
auto-encoder network we call dual TriNet. The encoder part of the TriNet learns
to map multi-layer visual features of deep CNNs, that is, multi-level concepts,
to a semantic vector. In semantic space, we search for related concepts, which
are then projected back into the image feature spaces by the decoder portion of
the TriNet. Two strategies in the semantic space are explored. Notably, this
seemingly simple strategy results in complex augmented feature distributions in
the image feature space, leading to substantially better performance.

for its solution. This paper builds on the scope for usage of macroscopically
semi-empirical models for degradation cost in economic dispatch problems and
proves that these cost models derived from the existing semi-empirical capacity
fade equations for LiFePO4 cells are convex under some operating condi-tions.
The proposed non-linear model was tested on two data sets of varying size which
portray different trends of seasonality. The results show that the model
reflects the trends of seasonality existing in the data sets and it mini-mizes
the total fuel cost globally when compared to conventional systems of economic
dispatch. The results thus indicate that the model achieves a more accurate
estimate of fuel cost in the system and can be effectively utilized for cost

high-temperature superconductivity in the anomalous part, while it generates
Mott gap and pseudogap in the normal part. Here, we elucidate that
fractionalization of electrons, which is exactly hold in the Mott insulator in
the atomic limit, more generally produces the emergent Mott-gap fermion and
dark (hidden) fermions. It does not require any spontaneous symmetry breaking.
The two gaps are the consequences of the hybridization of these two fermions
with quasiparticles. We further propose that the Mott-gap fermion and dark
fermions are the fermionic component of Frenkel- and Wannier-type excitons,
respectively, which coexist in the doped Mott insulator. The Bose-Einstein
condensation of the Frenkel-type excitons allowed without spontaneous symmetry
breaking holds a key for understanding the unique pole structure and the
pseudogap through the instantaneous hybridization between the fractionalized
quasiparticle and the dark fermion in analogy with the Mott gap. We argue that
the high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity is ascribed to the dipole attraction of
the Wannier-type excitons. The gap formation mechanism is compared with that
caused by conventional spontaneous symmetry breaking known over condensed
matter and elementary particle physics including quantum chromodynamics. We

(NCC) of ultrasound radio-frequency (RF) data of the pre- and post-compressed
images is a popular technique for strain estimation due to its simplicity and
computational efficiency. Several papers have been published to increase the
accuracy and quality of displacement estimation based on NCC. All of these
methods use spatial windows to estimate NCC, wherein displacement magnitude is
assumed to be constant within each window. In this work, we extend this
assumption along the temporal domain to exploit neighboring samples in both
spatial and temporal directions. This is important since traditional and
ultrafast ultrasound machines are, respectively, capable of imaging at more
than 30 frame per second (fps) and 1000 fps. We call our method spatial

hyperspectral image (HSI) and a multispectral image (MSI) to produce a
super-resolution image (SRI) that has fine spatial and spectral resolution.
State-of-the-art methods approach the problem via low-rank matrix
approximations to the matricized HSI and MSI. These methods are effective to
some extent, but a number of challenges remain. First, HSIs and MSIs are
naturally third-order tensors (data ""cubes"") and thus matricization is prone to
loss of structural information--which could degrade performance. Second, it is
unclear whether or not these low-rank matrix-based fusion strategies can
guarantee identifiability or exact recovery of the SRI. However,
identifiability plays a pivotal role in estimation problems and usually has a
significant impact on performance in practice. Third, the majority of the
existing methods assume that there are known (or easily estimated) degradation
operators applied to the SRI to form the corresponding HSI and MSI--which is
hardly the case in practice. In this work, we propose to tackle the
super-resolution problem from a tensor perspective. Specifically, we utilize
the multidimensional structure of the HSI and MSI to propose a coupled tensor
factorization framework that can effectively overcome the aforementioned
issues. The proposed approach guarantees the identifiability of the SRI under
mild and realistic conditions. Furthermore, it works with little knowledge of
the degradation operators, which is clearly an advantage over the existing
methods. Semi-real numerical experiments are included to show the effectiveness
of the proposed approach.

tasks. Only the structure of the network is considered by a majority of the

  In this paper, we propose a nonnegative matrix factorization based
optimization framework, namely FSCNMF which considers both the network

regularizes structure based on content and vice versa to exploit the
consistency between the structure and content to the best possible extent. We
further extend the basic FSCNMF to an advanced method, namely FSCNMF++ to
capture the higher order proximities in the network. We conduct experiments on

Hydrogen by the coherent emission/absorption of axions causes a lowering of
their spin temperature and can explain the stronger than expected absorption of
21-cm light reported by the EDGES collaboration. We find the analogy of axion
interaction with the two level HI with the Jaynes-Cummings model of a two level
atom in a cavity and we derive the spin flip frequency in this formalism and
show that the coherent oscillations frequency $\Omega \propto 1/f_a$ in
contrast with the incoherent transitions between the HI hyperfine levels where
the transition rates $\propto 1/f_a^2$. The axion emission and absorption rates
are equal but the spin temperature is still lowered due to different selection
rules for the spin flip transitions compared to the photon process. We show
that the axion process goes in the right direction for explaining the EDGES
observation. For this mechanism to work we require a coherent field of
relativistic axions with energy $E_\nu$ peaked at the 21-cm spin-flip energy.
Such a coherent background of relativistic axions can arise from the decay of
cosmic strings if the decay takes place in the electroweak era.

investigate how the far-IR water ice features at 45 and 63 micron change with
key disk properties: disk size, grain sizes, disk dust mass, dust settling, and
ice thickness. In addition, a series of models is devised to calculate the
water ice emission features from warmup, direct deposit and cooldown scenarios
of the water ice in disks. Photodesorption from icy grains in disk surfaces
weakens the mid-IR water ice features by factors 4-5. The far-IR water ice
emission features originate from small grains at the surface snow line in disks
at distance of 10-100 au. Unless this reservoir is missing in disks (e.g.
transitional disks with large cavities), the feature strength is not changing.
Grains larger than 10 micron do not contribute to the features. Grain settling
(using turbulent description) is affecting the strength of the ice features by
at most 15%. The strength of the ice feature scales with the disk dust mass and
water ice fraction on the grains, but saturates for dust masses larger than
1.e-4 Msun and for ice mantles that increase the dust mass by more than 50%.
The various thermal histories of water ice leave an imprint on the shape of the
features (crystalline/amorphous) as well as on the peak strength and position
of the 45 micron feature. SOFIA/HIRMES can only detect crystalline ice features

(peaks) and minima (dips) identified in the smoothed distribution of halos and
dark matter (DM) on scales of $10-100$s Mpcs. The simulations include Gaussian
and local-type $f_{\rm NL}$ non-Gaussian initial conditions. The expression
derived in the literature for the abundance (irrespective of height) of peaks
for Gaussian fields is surprisingly accurate for the evolved halo and DM
density fields for all initial conditions considered. Furthermore, the height
distribution is very well fitted by a log-normal on quasi-linear scales. The
abundance as a function of scale depends on the cosmological parameters ($H_0$
and background matter densities) through the shape of the power spectrum, but
it is insensitive to the clustering amplitude. Further, the abundance in the
smoothed halo distribution is substantially different in the non-Gaussian from
the Gaussian simulations. The interpretation of this effect is straightforward
in terms of the scale dependence of halo bias in non-Gaussian models. The
abundance of extrema extracted from three-dimensional large galaxy redshift
surveys could be a competitive probe of the cosmological parameters and initial
non-Gaussianity. It breaks the degeneracy between $f_{\rm NL}$ and the
clustering amplitude, making it complementary to counts of galaxy clusters and
peaks in weak-lensing maps.

the network to contextualise local information useful for prediction. The
proposed attention mechanism is generic and it can be easily incorporated into
any existing classification architectures, while only requiring a few
additional parameters. We show that, when the base network has a high capacity,
the incorporated attention mechanism can provide efficient object localisation
while improving the overall performance. When the base network has a low

significantly reduces false positives. Lastly, the generated attention maps
allow us to understand the model's reasoning process, which can also be used
for weakly supervised object localisation.

successfully fitted by a power-law. The light curves and photon indices in the
three energy ranges are obtained. Then, light curves in three narrow energy
ranges, i.e., 0.2-0.5 GeV, 2-5 GeV and 20- 40 GeV, are constructed, and the
relative variability amplitudes in the three narrow energy ranges are

groups of photon indices in the energy ranges of 0.1-1 GeV, 1-10 GeV, and
10-300 GeV keep nearly constant; (iii) the ratio between relative variability
amplitudes in different narrow energy ranges are equal (within their errors) to

wireless connectivity for the UAVs as well as a secure operation, various
challenges need to be addressed such as interference management, mobility
management and handover, cyber-physical attacks, and authentication. In this
paper, the goal is to expose the wireless and security challenges that arise in
the context of UAV-based delivery systems, UAV-based real-time multimedia

been widely applied to modular datacenters. Optical technologies based on
Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) are gaining popularity for Data Center
Networks (DCNs) due to their technological strengths such as low communication
latency, low power consumption, and high link bandwidth. Therefore, it is worth
investigating optical techniques into the BCube architecture for future DCNs.
For this purpose, we study the forwarding and optical indices in an all-optical
BCube network. Consider an all-optical BCube network in which every host sets
up a connection with every other host. The optical index is the minimum number
of wavelengths required by the network to support such a host-to-host traffic,
under the restriction that each connection is assigned a wavelength that
remains constant in the network. A routing is a set of directed paths specified
for all host pairs. By defining the maximum link load of a routing as the
maximum number of paths passing through any link, the forwarding index is
measured to be the minimum of maximum link load over all possible routings. The
forwarding index turns out to be a natural lower bound of the optical index. In
this paper, we first compute the forwarding index of an all-optical BCube
network. Then, we derive an upper bound of the optical index by providing an
oblivious routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) schemes, which attains the
lower bound given by the forwarding index in some small cases. Finally, a
tighter upper bound is obtained by means of the chromatic numbers in Graph
Theory.

different global phase portraits on the Poincar\'{e} disk. We try to illustrate
that the noncanonical field will not expand the regime of inflation, but it
will increase the possibility of the occurrence of inflation as well and the

are consistent with the $\tau$-lepton decay origin. However, these events are
in contradiction with the standard neutrino-matter interaction models as well
as the $\rm EeV$ diffuse neutrino flux limits set by the IceCube and the cosmic
ray facilities like AUGER. In this paper, we have reinvestigated the
possibility of using sterile neutrino hypothesis to explain the ANITA anomalous
events. The diffuse flux of the sterile neutrinos is less constrained by the
IceCube and AUGER experiments due to the small active-sterile mixing
suppression. The quantum decoherence effect should be included for describing
the neutrino flux propagating in the Earth matter, because the interactions
between neutrinos and the Earth matter are very strong at the EeV scale. After
several experimental approximations, we show that the ANITA anomaly itself is
able to be explained by the sterile neutrino origin, but we also predict that
the IceCube observatory should have more events than ANITA. It makes the
sterile neutrino origin very unlikely to account for both of them
simultaneously. A more solid conclusion can be drawn by the dedicated ANITA
signal simulations.

Neuroevolution, however, has so far resisted the application of these

insight is that we can sidestep this problem by using kernel-based surrogate
models, which require only the definition of a distance measure between

these two ideas, we introduce a surrogate-assisted neuroevolution algorithm

overwhelmingly concentrate the attention by exhibiting real-space nano-optics

quasiparticles. Here we present the mid-infrared nanophotonics of talc, a
natural atomically flat layered material, and graphene-talc (G-talc)
heterostructures using broadband synchrotron infrared nano-spectroscopy. We
achieve wavelength tuning of the talc resonances, assigned to in- and
out-of-plane vibrations by changing the thickness of the crystals, which serves
as its infrared fingerprints. Moreover, we encounter coupling of the graphene
plasmons polaritons with surface optical phonons of talc. As in the case of the
G-hBN heterostructures, this coupling configures hybrid surface plasmon
phonon-polariton modes causing 30 % increase in intensity for the out-of-plane
mode, blue-shift for the in-plane mode and we have succeeded in altering the
amplitude of such hybridization by varying the gate voltage. Therefore, our
results promote talc and G-talc heterostructures as appealing materials for

  Nonsmooth Stochastic Convex Optimization",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Classical theory for quasi-Newton schemes has focused on smooth deterministic
unconstrained optimization while recent forays into stochastic convex
optimization have largely resided in smooth, unconstrained, and strongly convex
regimes. Naturally, there is a compelling need to address nonsmoothness, the
lack of strong convexity, and the presence of constraints. Accordingly, this
paper presents a quasi-Newton framework that can process merely convex and
possibly nonsmooth (but smoothable) stochastic convex problems. We propose a
framework that combines iterative smoothing and regularization with a
variance-reduced scheme reliant on using increasing sample-sizes of gradients.
We make the following contributions. (i) We develop a regularized and smoothed
variable sample-size BFGS update (rsL-BFGS) that generates a sequence of
Hessian approximations and can accommodate nonsmooth convex objectives by
utilizing iterative regularization and smoothing. (ii) In strongly convex
regimes with state-dependent noise, the proposed variable sample-size
stochastic quasi-Newton scheme admits a non-asymptotic linear rate of
convergence while the oracle complexity of computing an $\epsilon$-solution is
$\mathcal{O}(\kappa^{m+1}/\epsilon)$ where $\kappa$ is the condition number and
$m\geq 1$. In nonsmooth (but smoothable) regimes, using Moreau smoothing
retains the linear convergence rate. To contend with the possible
unavailability of Lipschitzian and strong convexity parameters, we also provide
sublinear rates; (iii) In merely convex but smooth settings, the regularized

showed their applicability to enable random access in DNA storage. In this work
we follow the research of Yazdi et al. and study MU codes along with their
extensions to correct errors and balanced codes. We first review a well known
construction of MU codes and study the asymptotic behavior of its cardinality.
This task is accomplished by studying a special class of run-length limited
codes that impose the longest run of zeros to be at most some function of the
codewords length. We also present an efficient algorithm for this class of
constrained codes and show how to use this analysis for MU codes. Next, we
extend the results on the run-length limited codes in order to study
$(d_h,d_m)$-MU codes that impose a minimum Hamming distance of $d_h$ between
different codewords and $d_m$ between prefixes and suffixes. In particular, we
show an efficient construction of these codes with nearly optimal redundancy.
We also provide similar results for the edit distance and balanced MU codes.
Lastly, we draw connections to the problems of comma-free and prefix

Incommensurate heterostructures with rotational symmetry but not translational

the interlayer interaction has often been assumed to be negligible due to the
lack of phase coherence. Here we report the successful growth of
quasicrystalline 30{\deg} twisted bilayer graphene (30{\deg}-tBLG) which is
stabilized by the Pt(111) substrate, and reveal its electronic structure. The
30{\deg}-tBLG is confirmed by low energy electron diffraction and the
intervalley double-resonance Raman mode at 1383 cm$^{-1}$. Moreover, the
emergence of mirrored Dirac cones inside the Brillouin zone of each graphene
layer and a gap opening at the zone boundary suggest that these two graphene
layers are coupled via a generalized Umklapp scattering mechanism, i.e.
scattering of Dirac cone in one graphene layer by the reciprocal lattice vector
of the other graphene layer. Our work highlights the important role of
interlayer coupling in incommensurate quasicrystalline superlattices, thereby

off-line ASR, since real-time/low-latency constraints inevitably hinder the use
of future information, that is known to be very helpful to perform robust

neural acoustic models with context windows that gather some future frames.
This introduces a latency which depends on the number of employed look-ahead
features. This paper explores a different approach, based on estimating the
future rather than waiting for it. Our technique encourages the hidden
representations of a unidirectional recurrent network to embed some useful
information about the future. Inspired by a recently proposed technique called
Twin Networks, we add a regularization term that forces forward hidden states
to be as close as possible to cotemporal backward ones, computed by a ""twin""
neural network running backwards in time. The experiments, conducted on a
number of datasets, recurrent architectures, input features, and acoustic
conditions, have shown the effectiveness of this approach. One important
advantage is that our method does not introduce any additional computation at
test time if compared to standard unidirectional recurrent networks.

replacement of the conventional aerospace-grade metal alloys (aluminum,
titanium, magnesium, etc.) with CFRP composites results in new challenges. For
example, an aircraft during flight is prone to be struck by lightning. To
withstand the injection of such massive amount of energy, adequate electrical
properties, mainly electrical conductivity, is required. In fact, electrical
conductance (or its reciprocal, resistance) is a critical parameter
representing any material change and it can be considered an index for health
monitoring. In this paper, AS4/8552 carbon/epoxy laminated composites were
injected with two types of electrical currents, impulse current and direct
current. The change in measured electrical resistance was recorded. A
significant resistance drop occurred after electrical current injections.
Furthermore, four-point flexural tests were performed on these composites to
correlate an electrical resistance change with a potential flexural property
change. There was no clear trend between a resistance change and flexural
strength/modulus change of the test coupons, regardless of current injection.
However, it was observed that the injection of the current affects the contact
resistance such that its resistance decreases.

probabilistic seismic hazard analysis. It is frequently estimated by the
Bayesian inference. This is a non-regular case and suffers some shortcomings in
contrast to the Bayesian inference for the regular case of likelihood function.
Here previous non-Bayesian inference methods are outlined and discussed as
alternatives including, the formulation of the corresponding confidence
distributions (confidence or credible interval). Furthermore, the consideration
of prior information is extended to non-Bayesian estimation methods. In
addition, two new estimation approaches with prior information are developed.
The performances of previous and new estimation methods and corresponding
confidence distributions were studied by using Monte Carlo simulations. The
mean squared error and bias were used as the main performance measures for the
point estimations. In summary, previous, and new alternatives overcome the
fundamental weakness of the Bayesian inference for the upper bound magnitude.
These alternatives are not perfect but extend the opportunities for the
estimation of the upper bound magnitude considerably, especially the
consideration of prior information. A prior distribution reduces the global
mean squared error but leads to a local bias...
