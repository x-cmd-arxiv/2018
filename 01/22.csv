effective field theory leads to a loss of information with a concomitant
increase in entropy. We obtain the effective field theory of a light scalar
field interacting with heavy fields after tracing out the heavy degrees of
freedom from the time evolved density matrix. The initial density matrix
describes the light field in its ground state and the heavy fields in
equilibrium at a common temperature $T$. For $T=0$, we obtain the reduced
density matrix in a perturbative expansion, it reveals an emergent mixed state
as a consequence of the entanglement between light and heavy fields. We obtain
the effective action that determines the time evolution of the \emph{reduced}
density matrix for the light field in a non-perturbative Dyson resummation of
one-loop correlations of the heavy fields. The Von-Neumann \emph{entanglement
entropy} associated with the reduced density matrix is obtained for the
non-resonant and resonant cases in the asymptotic long time limit. In the
non-resonant case the reduced density matrix displays an \emph{incipient}
thermalization albeit with a wave-vector, time and coupling dependent
\emph{effective temperature} as a consequence of memory of initial conditions.
The entanglement entropy is time independent and is the \emph{thermal entropy}
for this effective, non-equilibrium temperature. In the resonant case the light
field fully \emph{thermalizes} with the heavy fields, the reduced density
matrix looses memory of the initial conditions and the entanglement entropy
becomes the \emph{thermal entropy} of the light field. We discuss the relation
between the entanglement entropy ultraviolet divergences and renormalization.

  http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8247211/",,,,"cs.IT math.DS math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This letter proposes a novel UAV-enabled mobile jamming scheme to improve the
secrecy rate of ground wiretap channel. Specifically, a UAV is employed to
transmit jamming signals to combat against eavesdropping. Such a mobile jamming
scheme is particularly appealing since the UAV-enabled jammer can fly close to
the eavesdropper and opportunistically jam it by leveraging the UAV's mobility.
We aim to maximize the average secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the UAV's
trajectory and jamming power over a given flight period. To make the problem
more tractable, we drive a closed-form lower bound for the achievable secrecy
rate, based on which the UAV's trajectory and transmit power are optimized
alternately by an efficient iterative algorithm applying the block coordinate
descent and successive convex optimization techniques. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed joint design can significantly enhance the
secrecy rate of the considered wiretap system as compared to benchmark schemes.

achieved by the collective action of oppositely directed dynein and kinesin

to as {\em paradox of codependence} is inconsistent with the existing paradigm

dynein motors exhibit catchbonding, wherein the unbinding rates of these motors
decrease with increasing force on them. Incorporating this catchbonding

divergence of the two motors species manifests itself as an internal regulatory

analyse the processivity characteristics and probability distribution of run

Migration and dispersal of animals has evolved under control of natural

Darwinian fitness. We introduce new models of purposeful kinesis with diffusion
coefficient dependent on fitness. The local and instant evaluation of Darwinian
fitness is used, the reproduction coefficient. New models include one

a series of numerical experiments. It is demonstrated how kinesis could be
beneficial for assimilation of patches of food or of periodic fluctuations.
Kinesis based on local and instant estimations of fitness is not always

dust grains into the environment of an SN remnant (SNR) and trace their
trajectories by applying a 1D hydrodynamic description assuming spherical
symmetry to describe the plasma dynamics, and include a rudimentary, 3D
magnetic field description to examine its influence on charged dust grains. We
assume the interstellar medium (ISM) magnetic fields are turbulent, and are
amplified by the SNR shock, while the SN wind and ejecta fields are negligible.
We examine the various influences on the dust grains within the SNR to
determine when/if the dust decouples from the plasma, how much it is sputtered,
and where within the SNR the dust grains are located. We find that
Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities are important for dust survival, as they
influence the location of the SN's reverse shock. We find that the presence of
a magnetic field within the shocked ISM material limits the passage of SN dust
grains, with the field either reflecting or trapping the grains within the

platform companies like Facebook and Twitter have been summoned to testify
about bots as part of investigations into digitally-enabled foreign

from both the public and from legislators, these companies have been instructed
to crack down on apparently malicious bot accounts. But as this article
demonstrates, since the earliest writings on bots in the 1990s, there has been
substantial confusion as to exactly what a 'bot' is and what exactly a bot
does. We argue that multiple forms of ambiguity are responsible for much of the
complexity underlying contemporary bot-related policy, and that before
successful policy interventions can be formulated, a more comprehensive
understanding of bots --- especially how they are defined and measured --- will
be needed. In this article, we provide a history and typology of different
types of bots, provide clear guidelines to better categorize political
automation and unpack the impact that it can have on contemporary technology
policy, and outline the main challenges and ambiguities that will face both

scene-centric and object-centric knowledge (i.e. Places and ImageNet) in CNNs.
An earlier attempt, Hybrid-CNN, showed that incorporating ImageNet did not help
much. Here we propose an alternative method taking the scale into account,
resulting in significant recognition gains. By analyzing the response of
ImageNet-CNNs and Places-CNNs at different scales we find that both operate in
different scale ranges, so using the same network for all the scales induces
dataset bias resulting in limited performance. Thus, adapting the feature
extractor to each particular scale (i.e. scale-specific CNNs) is crucial to
improve recognition, since the objects in the scenes have their specific range
of scales. Experimental results show that the recognition accuracy highly
depends on the scale, and that simple yet carefully chosen multi-scale
combinations of ImageNet-CNNs and Places-CNNs, can push the state-of-the-art
recognition accuracy in SUN397 up to 66.26% (and even 70.17% with deeper

distance-independent force in $\mathcal{D}=1$. Under mild additional
assumptions regarding symmetry and fluctuations we investigate equilibrium
states of self-gravitating material clusters, in particular radial density
profiles for closed and open systems. We present exact analytic results in
several instances and high-precision numerical data in others. The density
profile of a cluster with finite mass is found to exhibit exponential decay in
$\mathcal{D}=1$ and power-law decay in $\mathcal{D}=2$ with
temperature-dependent exponents in both cases. In $\mathcal{D}=2$ the gas
evaporates in a continuous transition at a nonzero critical temperature. We
describe clusters of infinite mass in $\mathcal{D}=3$ with a density profile
consisting of three layers (core, shell, halo) and an algebraic large-distance
asymptotic decay. In $\mathcal{D}=3$ a cluster of finite mass can be stabilized
at $T>0$ via confinement to a sphere of finite radius. In some parameter
regime, the gas thus enclosed undergoes a discontinuous transition between
distinct density profiles. For the free energy needed to identify the
equilibrium state we introduce a construction of gravitational self-energy that
works in all $\mathcal{D}$ for the lattice gas. The decay rate of the density

this approach, we consider standard uncertainty quantification benchmark

developed is very good even though there is no underlying structure shared

intriguing population with large HI reservoirs associated with little current
star formation. These galaxies have stellar masses $M_{\star} >10^{10}$
M$_{\odot}$, and were identified as outliers in the gas fraction vs. NUV$-r$
color and stellar mass surface density scaling relations based on the GALEX
Arecibo SDSS Survey (GASS). We obtained HI interferometry with the GMRT, Keck
optical long-slit spectroscopy and deep optical imaging (where available) for
four galaxies. Our analysis reveals multiple possible reasons for the HI excess
in these systems. One galaxy, AGC 10111, shows an HI disk that is
counter-rotating with respect to the stellar bulge, a clear indication of
external origin of the gas. Another galaxy appears to host a Malin 1-type disk,
where a large specific angular momentum has to be invoked to explain the
extreme $M_{\rm HI}$/$M_{\star}$ ratio of 166$\%$. The other two galaxies have
early-type morphology with very high gas fractions. The lack of merger
signatures (unsettled gas, stellar shells and streams) in these systems
suggests that these gas-rich disks have been built several Gyr-s ago, but it
remains unclear how the gas reservoirs were assembled. Numerical simulations of
large cosmological volumes are needed to gain insight into the formation of
these rare and interesting systems.

symmetric spaces in the sense of Cartan. In this paper we use these models,
combined with results due to a number of authors concerning the Schubert
decomposition of Lie groups, symmetric spaces via the Cartan model together
with Iwasawa decomposition to give a cell decomposition of the global Milnor
fibers. The Schubert decomposition is in terms of ""unique ordered
factorizations"" of matrices in the Milnor fibers as products of ""

factorization has the form of iterated ""Cartan conjugacies"" by
pseudo-rotations. The ""Schubert cycles"" (the closures of the Schubert cells),
are images of products of suspensions of projective spaces (complex, real, or
quaternionic). For general or skew-symmetric matrices the Schubert cycles have
fundamental classes, and for symmetric matrices $\mod 2$ classes, giving a
basis for the homology, corresponding to the cohomology generators for the
symmetric spaces. For general matrices the duals of the Schubert cycles are
given as explicit monomials in the generators of the exterior cohomology
algebra; and for symmetric matrices they are related to Stiefel-Whitney classes
of an associated vector bundle. Furthermore, for any matrix singularity of
these types the pull-backs of these cohomolgy classes generate a characteristic
subalgebra of the cohomology of the Milnor fiber. These results extend to
exceptional orbit hypersurfaces, complements and links.

the Bragg peak region in water as well as by more energetic carbon ions. The
diffusion equation for low-energy electrons emitted from a finite-size
spherical source representing the surface of the metal core is solved to obtain
the electron number density as a function of radial distance and time.
Information on the atomistic structure and composition of the coating is
obtained from molecular dynamics simulations performed with the MBN Explorer

collective excitations of valence $d$ electrons in individual atoms of gold.
Diffusion coefficients and characteristic lifetimes of electrons propagating in
gold, water, and poly(ethylene glycol) are obtained from relativistic partial
wave analysis and the dielectric formalism, respectively. On this basis, the
number of electrons released through the organic coating into the surrounding
aqueous medium and the number of hydroxyl radicals produced are evaluated. The
largest increase of the radical yield due to low-energy electrons is observed
when the nanoparticle is excited by an ion with energy significantly exceeding

the most economic influence in an examined subset of the global economy. The
proposed method represents the indices as nodes in a directed graph, where the
edges' weights are estimates of the pair-wise causal influences, quantified
using the directed information functional. This method facilitates using a
relatively small number of samples from each index. The indices are then ranked
according to their net-flow in the estimated graph (sum of the incoming weights
subtracted from the sum of outgoing weights). Daily and minute-by-minute data
from nine indices (three from Asia, three from Europe and three from the US)
were analyzed. The analysis of daily data indicates that the US indices are the
most influential, which is consistent with intuition that the indices
representing larger economies usually exert more influence. Yet, it is also
shown that an index representing a small economy can strongly influence an
index representing a large economy if the smaller economy is indicative of a
larger phenomenon. Finally, it is shown that while inter-region interactions
can be captured using daily data, intra-region interactions require more
frequent samples.

1 AU) reaches tens or even hundreds of Earth masses already in the embedded
phase of star formation and even a greater amount of grown dust drifts in the
inner, unresolved 1 AU of the disk. Dust does not usually grow to radii greater
than a few cm. A notable exception are models with \alpha <= 10^{-3}, in which
case a zone with reduced mass transport develops in the inner disk and dust can
grow to meter-sized boulders in the inner 10 AU. Grown dust drifts inward and
accumulates in the inner disk regions. This effect is most pronounced in the
\alpha <= 10^{-3} models where several hundreds of Earth masses can be
accumulated in a narrow region of several AU from the star by the end of
embedded phase. (abridged).

the electronic and thermoelectric transport properties of Ca substituted Sr3SnO
(Sr3-xCaxSnO). The effects of Ca subtitution on bandgap are studied and
detailed mechanisms are proposed to explain the obtained results. We have found
that effective mass and thermopower of Sr3SnO redueces with the increase of
hole concentration. The optimum hole concentration has been obtained for
Sr2CaSnO and the corresponding Seebeck coefficient is 219 {\mu}V/K. The
electrical conductivity of Sr3SnO and its alloys exhibits semiconducting nature
which contradicts with experimental results in Ca3SnO. We have found that due
to the Ca-deficiency, the Ca3SnO shows the metallic conductivity and removes
this contradiction with our results. The lattice thermal conductivities (\kl)
of Sr3SnO and Ca3SnO have been calculated by using both PBE and GW functionals.
The lattice thermal conductivity obtained by PBE functional largely
underestimates the experimental value for Ca3SnO. The total thermal
conductivity (with kl obtained by GW) at 300K is 2.33 and 1.897 W/mK for Sr3SnO

1.707 W/mK for Ca3SnO. The dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) for Sr2CaSnO at
500 K is 0.6 and making it promising for thermoelectric applications.

three complementary transport techniques on underdoped

order of magnitude below the pseudogap temperature. Within the vortex liquid,
an unanticipated, insulatinglike region, but with strong superconducting

policy accounts for the model error between target and source. The main benefit
of this policy augmentation is generalizing policies across multiple related

by an anomalous suppression of long-wavelength (i.e., large-length-scale)
density fluctuations compared to those found in garden-variety disordered
systems, such as ordinary fluids and amorphous solids. All perfect crystals,
perfect quasicrystals and special disordered systems are hyperuniform. Thus,
the hyperuniformity concept enables a unified framework to classify and
structurally characterize crystals, quasicrystals and the exotic disordered
varieties. While disordered hyperuniform systems were largely unknown in the
scientific community over a decade ago, now there is a realization that such
systems arise in a host of contexts across the physical, materials, chemical,
mathematical, engineering, and biological sciences, including disordered ground
states, glass formation, jamming, Coulomb systems, spin systems, photonic and
electronic band structure, localization of waves and excitations,
self-organization, fluid dynamics, number theory, stochastic point processes,
integral and stochastic geometry, the immune system, and photoreceptor cells.
Such unusual amorphous states can be obtained via equilibrium or nonequilibrium
routes, and come in both quantum-mechanical and classical varieties. The
connections of hyperuniform states of matter to many different areas of
fundamental science appear to be profound and yet our theoretical understanding
of these unusual systems is only in its infancy. The purpose of this review
article is to introduce the reader to the theoretical foundations of
hyperuniform ordered and disordered systems. Special focus will be placed on
fundamental and practical aspects of the disordered kinds, including our
current state of knowledge of these exotic amorphous systems as well as their

approach for solving a wide spectrum of regularized stochastic minimization
problems, where the regularization term is composite with a linear function. It
has been recognized that solving this kind of problem is challenging since the
closed-form solution of the proximal mapping associated with the regularization
term is not available due to the imposed linear composition, and the
per-iteration cost of computing the full gradient of the expected objective
function is extremely high when the number of input data samples is
considerably large.
  Our new approach overcomes these issues by exploring the special structure of
the regularization term and sampling a few data points at each iteration.
Rather than analyzing the convergence in expectation, we provide the detailed
iteration complexity analysis for the cases of both uniformly and non-uniformly
averaged iterates with high probability. This strongly supports the good
practical performance of the proposed approach. Numerical experiments

to study the circumstellar environment of HH 250-IRS at 225 and 351 GHz with CO
(2-1) and CO (3-2) maps and 0.9 mm and 1.3 mm continuum images. The HH 250-IRS
source is resolved into a binary with 0''53 separation, corresponding to 120 AU
at the adopted distance of 225 pc. The individual components show heavily
veiled spectra with weak CO absorption indicative of late-type stars. Both are
Class I sources, but their spectral energy distributions between 1.5 $\mu$m and
19 $\mu$m differ markedly and suggest the existence of a large cavity around
one of the components. The millimeter interferometric observations indicate
that the gas mainly traces a circumbinary envelope or disk, while the dust
emission is dominated by one of the circumstellar envelopes. HH 250-IRS is a
new addition to the handful of multiple systems where the individual stellar
components, the circumstellar disks and a circumbinary disk can be studied in
detail, and a rare case among those systems in which a Herbig-Haro flow is
present.

translated modalities from given modalities in MR images without real

conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs). Our framework jointly
exploits the low-level features (pixel-wise information) and high-level
representations (e.g. brain tumors, brain structure like gray matter, etc.)
between cross modalities which are important for resolving the challenging
complexity in brain structures. Our framework can serve as an auxiliary method
in clinical diagnosis and has great application potential. Based on our
proposed framework, we first propose a method for cross-modality registration
by fusing the deformation fields to adopt the cross-modality information from
translated modalities. Second, we propose an approach for MRI segmentation,
translated multichannel segmentation (TMS), where given modalities, along with
translated modalities, are segmented by fully convolutional networks (FCN) in a
multichannel manner. Both of these two methods successfully adopt the
cross-modality information to improve the performance without adding any extra
data. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework advances the
state-of-the-art on five brain MRI datasets. We also observe encouraging
results in cross-modality registration and segmentation on some widely adopted
brain datasets. Overall, our work can serve as an auxiliary method in clinical

novel physics including superconductivity. Due to the Ising SOC, monolayer
NbSe$_2$ and gated MoS$_2$ of 2H structure can realize the Ising
superconductivity phase, which manifests itself with in-plane upper critical
field far exceeding Pauli paramagnetic limit. Surprisingly, we find that a

($H_{c2,//}$) which goes beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit. Importantly, the
in-plane upper critical field shows an emergent two-fold symmetry which is
different from the isotropic $H_{c2,//}$ in 2H structure TMDCs. We show that
this is a result of an asymmetric SOC in 1Td structure TMDCs. The asymmetric
SOC is very strong and estimated to be on the order of tens of meV. Our work
provides the first transport evidence of a new type of asymmetric SOC in TMDCs
which may give rise to novel superconducting and spin transport properties.
Moreover, our findings mostly depend on the symmetry of the crystal and apply
to a whole class of 1Td TMDCs such as 1Td-WTe$_2$ which is under intense study

the outer planet. The outer planet (K2-155d) is near the habitable zone, with
an insolation $1.67\pm 0.38$ times that of the Earth. The planet's radius falls
within the range between that of smaller rocky planets and larger gas-rich
planets. To assess the habitability of this planet, we present a series of 3D
global climate simulations assuming that K2-155d is tidally locked and has an
Earth-like composition and atmosphere. We find that the planet can maintain a
moderate surface temperature if the insolation proves to be smaller than $\sim
1.5$ times that of the Earth. Doppler mass measurements, transit spectroscopy,
and other follow-up observations should be rewarding, since K2-155 is one of
the optically brightest M dwarfs known to harbor transiting planets.

with proximity-induced superconductivity under an external magnetic field. An
applied magnetic field creates two Majorana bound states: a vortex Majorana
state localized inside a vortex core and an exterior Majorana state localized
along a circle centered at the vortex core. We calculate the spin-resolved
local density of states (LDOS) and demonstrate that the shrinking of the radius
of the exterior Majorana state, predicted in Ref. [R. S. Akzyanov et al., Phys.
Rev. B 94, 125428 (2016)], under a strong magnetic field can be seen in LDOS
without smeared out by non-zero-energy states. The spin-resolved LDOS further
reveals that the spin of the exterior Majorana state is strongly polarized.
Accordingly, the induced odd-frequency spin-triplet pairs are found to be
spin-polarized as well. In order to detect the exterior Majorana states,
however, the Fermi energy should be closed to the Dirac point to avoid
contributions from continuum levels. We also study a different two-dimensional
topological-superconducting system where a two-dimensional electron gas with
the spin-orbit coupling is sandwiched between an s-wave superconductor and a
ferromagnetic insulator. We show that the radius of an exterior Majorana state
can be tuned by an applied magnetic field. However, on the contrary to the
results at a TI surface, neither the exterior Majorana state nor the induced
odd-frequency spin-triplet pairs are spin-polarized. We conclude that the
spin-polarization of the Majorana state is attributed to the spin-polarized
Landau level which is characteristic for systems with the Dirac-like
dispersion.

challenges for 5G wireless systems will be handling the unprecedented spectrum
crunch. A potential solution has emerged in the form of spectrum sharing, which
deviates from a monopolistic spectrum usage system. This article investigates
the medium access control (MAC) as a means of increasing the viability of the
spectrum sharing technique. We first quantify the opportunity of spectrum
access in a probabilistic manner, a method referred to as opportunity
probability (OP). Based on the OP framework, we propose a random MAC algorithm
in which the access of a node is randomly determined with its own OP value. As
a possible application of our OP based random MAC, we propose a hybrid half
duplex (HD)/full duplex (FD) communication where each pair decides the
duplexing mode according to the OP values of the two pair nodes. This approach
fits well with the spectrum sharing system since it enables a flexible
operation for the spectrum access according to the spectrum usage level. From
the numerical analysis, we validate the feasibility and verify the performance
enhancements by implementing an FPGA based real-time prototype. Measurements
and numerical results confirm that the proposed architecture can achieve up to
4 times higher system throughput than conventional LTE-TDD (time division
duplex) systems.

  properties of Fe$_{2}$VAl and Fe$_{2}$TiSn compounds",,,,,"cond-mat.str-el","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  First-principles phonon calculations along with Kohn-Sham density functional
theory (DFT) is an essential tool to study the lattice dynamics,
thermodynamical properties and phase-transitions of materials. The two
full-Heusler compounds Fe$_{2}$VAl and Fe$_{2}$TiSn are studied for lattice
vibration dependent properties using finite displacement method and supercell
approach. For the investigation, four density functionals viz., LDA, PBE,
PBEsol and meta-GGA SCAN are employed. Using these functionals, phonon
dispersion, phonon density of states (DOS), partial density of states (PDOS)
thermal propertis and zero-point energy are calculated at equilibrum lattice
parameters under harmonic approximation. For the two compounds the Debye
temperatures are calculated from the obtained phonon DOS which are $\sim$660 K
and $\sim$540 K, respectively. The obtained results from different functionals
are compared among each other. The overall phonon energy in the dispersion is
found to be $\sim$15 meV higher in Fe$_{2}$VAl than the Fe$_{2}$TiSn compounds.
For the two compounds PBE is yielding the lowest phonon frequencies while LDA
or SCAN functional is giving the highest. The same pattern is observed in
phonon DOS plots of two compounds. The zero-point energy calculated is the
highest from SCAN (21.04 and 16.95 J) and the lowest from PBE functionals
(20.09 and 16.02 J) obeying the same trend as frequency for both compounds. A
general prediction of nature of lattice thermal conductivity is made based on
the velocities of acoustic phonons which is in agreement with the qualitative
behavior of reported experimental thermal conductivity of two compounds. Phonon
spectra obtained from PBE and SCAN have similar general features while those
from LDA and PBEsol have resembling features for Fe$_{2}$VAl, while this trend
is not observed for the compound Fe$_{2}$TiSn.

[A. Koliogiorgos et al., Comput. Mater. Sci. \textbf{138}, 92 (2017)], where MA
stands for the methylammonium cation, B is a divalent cation and X a halogen.
We expand our study in the case where Cs stands in place of the MA cation. Our
results suggest that the Cs-based compounds exhibit also a variety of lattice
constants and energy band gaps. The calculated equilibrium lattice constants
differ substantially from the experimental ones. The calculated energy gaps
also show large deviations for these lattice constants. Moreover, the use of
more sophisticated functionals leads to conflicting changes in the energy gap
values and its effect is materials dependent. Our results suggest that contrary
to the MA halide perovskites, the Cs halide perovskites consist a more delicate

Inflation, which postulates that the universe underwent a period of rapid
expansion an instant after its birth, provides convincing explanation for
cosmological observations. Recent advancements in detector technology have
opened opportunities to explore primordial gravitational waves generated by the
inflation through B-mode (divergent-free) polarization pattern embedded in the
Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropies. If detected, these signals would
provide strong evidence for inflation, point to the correct model for
inflation, and open a window to physics at ultra-high energies.
  LiteBIRD is a satellite mission with a goal of detecting
degree-and-larger-angular-scale B-mode polarization. LiteBIRD will observe at
the second Lagrange point with a 400 mm diameter telescope and 2,622 detectors.
It will survey the entire sky with 15 frequency bands from 40 to 400 GHz to
measure and subtract foregrounds.
  The U.S. LiteBIRD team is proposing to deliver sub-Kelvin instruments that
include detectors and readout electronics. A lenslet-coupled sinuous antenna
array will cover low-frequency bands (40 GHz to 235 GHz) with four frequency
arrangements of trichroic pixels. An orthomode-transducer-coupled corrugated
horn array will cover high-frequency bands (280 GHz to 402 GHz) with three
types of single frequency detectors. The detectors will be made with Transition
Edge Sensor (TES) bolometers cooled to a 100 milli-Kelvin base temperature by
an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator.The TES bolometers will be read out
using digital frequency multiplexing with Superconducting QUantum Interference
Device (SQUID) amplifiers. Up to 78 bolometers will be multiplexed with a
single SQUID amplidier.
  We report on the sub-Kelvin instrument design and ongoing developments for
the LiteBIRD mission.

  Theory and Data Quality Metrics",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Database normalization is the one of main principles for designing relational
databases. The benefits of normalization can be observed through improving data
quality and performance, among the other qualities. We explore a new context of
technical debt manifestation, which is linked to ill-normalized databases. This
debt can have long-term impact causing systematic degradation of database
qualities. Such degradation can be liken to accumulated interest on a debt. We
claim that debts are likely to materialize for tables below the fourth normal
form. Practically, achieving fourth normal form for all the tables in the
database is a costly and idealistic exercise. Therefore, we propose a pragmatic
approach to prioritize tables that should be normalized to the fourth normal
form based on the metaphoric debt and interest of the ill-normalized tables,
observed on data quality and performance. For data quality, tables are
prioritized using the risk of data inconsistency metric. Unlike data quality, a
suitable metric to estimate the impact of weakly or un-normalized tables on
performance is not available. We estimate performance degradation and its costs
using Input\Output (I\O) cost of the operations performed on the tables and we
propose a model to estimate this cost for each table. We make use of Modern
Portfolio Theory to prioritize tables that should be normalized based on the
estimated I\O cost and the likely risk of cost accumulation in the future. To
evaluate our methods, we use a case study from Microsoft, AdventureWorks. The
results show that our methods can be effective in reducing normalization debt
and improving the quality of the database.

of the probability generating function to do just that. Our results show that
different regimes exist for these asymptotics in case of light-tailed service

same decay ($\sim cn^{-3/2}R^{-n}$) as in the priority non-retrial queue and
the retrial rate only influences the constant $c$. In the `retrial regime', the
retrial rate also influences the sub-exponential factor of the asymptotics. In

$\alpha$-capture at all the measured energies. A simultaneous explanation of

after the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami of 2011 using Facebook Pages
with the aim of investigating the correlation between public sentiment and
people's actual needs in areas damaged by water disasters. In addition, we try
to analyze whether different types of disaster-related communication created
different kinds of relationships on people's activities in the physical world.
Our analysis reveals that sentiment of geo-info-related communication, which
might be affected by sentiment inside a damaged area, had a positive
correlation with the prices of used cars in the damaged area. On the other
hand, the sentiment of disaster-interest-based-communication, which might be
affected more by people who were interested in the disaster, but were outside
the damaged area, had a negative correlation with the prices of used cars. The
result could be interpreted to mean that when people begin to recover, used-car
prices rise because they become more positive in their sentiment. This study
suggests that, for long-term disaster-recovery analysis, we need to consider
the different characteristics of online communication posted by locals directly
affected by the disaster and non-locals not directly affected by the disaster.

The correctness of these applications highly depends on the resilience of the

application security, it is difficult to determine which inconsistencies can be
tolerated and which might lead to security breaches.
  In this paper, we discuss the problem of how to develop an access control
layer for applications using weakly consistent data stores without loosing the
performance benefits gained by using weaker consistency models. We present
ACGreGate, a Java framework for implementing correct access control layers for
applications using weakly consistent data stores. Under certain requirements on

correctly with respect to dynamically adaptable security policies. We used
ACGreGate to implement the access control layer of a student management system.
This case study shows that practically useful security policies can be

determining the topology of the bulk remains invariant, as long as the dynamics
is unitary. Nonetheless, the corresponding boundary attribute, the edge
current, displays interesting dynamics. For the case of sudden and adiabatic
quenches the post quench edge current is solely determined by the initial and
the final Hamiltonians, respectively. However for a finite time ($\tau$) linear
quench in a Haldane nano ribbon, we show that the evolution of the edge current
from the sudden to the adiabatic limit is not monotonic in $\tau$, and has a
turning point at a characteristic time scale $\tau=\tau_c$. For small $\tau$,
the excited states lead to a huge unidirectional surge in the edge current of
both the edges. On the other hand, in the limit of large $\tau$, the edge
current saturates to its expected equilibrium ground state value. This
competition between the two limits lead to the observed non-monotonic behavior.
Interestingly, $\tau_c$ seems to depend only on the Semenoff mass and the
Haldane flux. A similar dynamics for the edge current is also expected in other
systems with topological phases.

and population differences of atoms prepared in their clock states. Linear
birefringence of the atomic medium enables atom number detection via
polarisation homodyning, a form of common path interferometry. In order to
achieve low technical noise levels, we perform optical sideband detection after
adiabatic transformation of bare states into dressed states. The balanced
homodyne signal then oscillates independently of field fluctuations at twice
the dressing frequency, thus allowing for robust, phase-locked detection that
circumvents low-frequency noise. Using probe pulses of two optical frequencies,
we can detect both clock states simultaneously and obtain population difference
as well as the total atom number. The scheme also allows for difference
measurements by direct subtraction of the homodyne signals at the balanced
detector, which should technically enable quantum noise limited measurements
with prospects for the preparation of spin squeezed states. The method extends
to other Zeeman sublevels and can be employed in a range of atomic clock
schemes, atom interferometers, and other experiments using dressed atoms.

used to probe the inner regions of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Here, we
present the first measurements of the time delay between optical and
near-infrared (NIR) flux variations in H0507+164, a nearby Seyfert 1.5 galaxy
at z = 0.018. The observations in the optical V -band and NIR J, H and Ks bands
carried over 35 epochs during the period October 2016 to April 2017 were used
to estimate the inner radius of the dusty torus. From a careful reduction and
analysis of the data using cross-correlation techniques, we found delayed
responses of the J, H and Ks light curves to the V -band light curve. In the
rest frame of the source, the lags between optical and NIR bands are found to
be $27.1^{+13.5}_{-12.0}$ days (V vs. J), $30.4^{+13.9}_{-12.0}$ days (V vs. H)
and $34.6^{+12.1}_{-9.6}$ days (V vs. K ). The lags between the optical and
different NIR bands are thus consistent with each other. The measured lags
indicate that the inner edge of dust torus is located at a distance of 0.029 pc
from the central UV/optical AGN continuum. This is larger than the radius of
the broad line region of this object determined from spectroscopic monitoring
observations thereby supporting the unification model of AGN. The location of
H0507+164 in the {\tau} - MV plane indicates that our results are in excellent
agreement with the now known lag-luminosity scaling relationship for dust in
AGN.

contourlet domain image watermarking scheme for copyright protection. In the
embedding phase, we insert the watermark into the image using an additive
contourlet domain spread spectrum approach. In the detection phase, we design a
detector using likelihood ratio test (LRT). Since the performance of the LRT
detector is completely dependent on the accuracy of the employed statistical
model, we first study the statistical properties of the contourlet
coefficients. This study demonstrates the heteroscedasticity and heavy-tailed
marginal distribution of these coefficients. Therefore, we propose using two
dimensional generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity
(2D-GARCH) model that is compatible with the contourlet coefficients. Motivated
by the modeling results, we design a new watermark detector based on 2D-GARCH
model. Also, we analyze its performance by computing the receiver operating
characteristics. Experimental results confirm the high efficiency of the
proposed detector. Since a watermark detector for copyright protection should
be robust against attacks, we examine the robustness of the proposed detector

such a low latency, due to collisions and buffering at nodes. Hence, we propose
in this article to use a deterministic scheme for sending periodic messages
without collisions in the network thus saving the latency incurred by
buffering.
  We give several algorithms to compute such schemes for a common topology
where one link is shared by all antennas. We show that there is always a
solution when the routes are short or the load is small. When the parameters
are unconstrained, and some buffering is allowed in the processing units, we
propose an algorithm (PMLS) adapted from a classical scheduling method. The
experimental results show that even under full load, most of the time PMLS
finds a deterministic sending scheme with no latency.

light-matter coupling and tightly bound excitons. Moreover, large spin orbit
coupling in combination with circular dichroism allows for spin and valley
selective optical excitation. As atomically thin materials, they are very
sensitive to changes in the surrounding environment. This motivates a
functionalization approach, where external molecules are adsorbed to the
materials surface to tailor its optical properties. Here, we apply the density
matrix theory to investigate the potential of non-covalently functionalized
TMDs. Considering exemplary spiropyran molecules with a strong dipole moment,
we predict spectral redshifts and the appearance of an additional side peak in

influence the optical properties of TMDs, leaving a unique optical fingerprint

phase diagram and analyze magnetic properties of the spin-1/2 and spin-1
J1-J2-J3 Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice. Based on the SU(2) and
SU(3) symmetry representations of the Schwinger boson approach, which treats
disordered spin liquids and magnetically ordered phases on an equal footing, we
obtain the complete phase diagrams in the (J2,J3)plane. This is achieved using
a fully unrestricted approach which does not assume any pre-defined Ansatze.
For S=1/2, we find a quantum spin liquid (QSL) stabilized between the N\'eel,
spiral and collinear antiferromagnetic phases in agreement with previous
theoretical work. However, by increasing S from 1/2 to 1, the QSL is quickly
destroyed due to the weakening of quantum fluctuations indicating that the
model already behaves as a quasi-classical system. The dynamical structure
factors and temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility are obtained
in order to characterize all phases in the phase diagrams. Moreover, motivated
by the relevance of the single-ion anisotropy, D, to various S=1 honeycomb
compounds, we have analyzed the destruction of magnetic order based on a SU(3)
representation of the Schwinger bosons. Our analysis provides a unified
understanding of the magnetic properties of honeycomb materials realizing the
J1-J2-J3 Heisenberg model from the strong quantum spin regime at S=1/2 to the
S=1 case. Neutron scattering and magnetic susceptibility experiments can be
used to test the destruction of the QSL phase when replacing S=1/2 by S=1
localized moments in certain honeycomb compounds.

Existing predictive frameworks base their forecasts primarily on time series
analysis, as well as the judgments of experts. As a consequence, current
approaches are often biased and prone to error. In order to reduce forecast
errors, this paper presents an innovative methodology that extends lag
variables with unstructured data in the form of financial news: (1) we apply a
variety of models from machine learning to word counts as a high-dimensional
input. However, this approach suffers from low interpretability and
overfitting, motivating the following remedies. (2) We follow the intuition
that the economic climate is driven by general sentiments and suggest a
projection of words onto latent semantic structures as a means of feature
engineering. (3) We propose a semantic path model, together with estimation
technique based on regularization, in order to yield full interpretability of
the forecasts. We demonstrate the predictive performance of our approach by
utilizing 80,813 ad hoc announcements in order to make long-term forecasts of
up to 24 months ahead regarding key macroeconomic indicators. Back-testing

previous measurements from proton-nucleus and pp collisions over the full

agrees within uncertainties with measurements from nucleus-nucleus collisions.

capture small compact objects to form extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs).
Such systems emit gravitational waves (GWs) in the band of the Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and are ideal probes of the space-time
geometry of MBHs. Recently, we have shown that MBHs could also capture
stellar-mass binary black holes (about $10\,M_\odot$) to form binary-EMRIs
(b-EMRIs) and, interestingly, a large fraction of the binaries coalesce due to
the tidal perturbation by the MBHs. Here we further show that the coalescence
could be detected by LISA as glitches in EMRI signals. We propose an experiment
to use the multi-band ($10^2$ and $10^{-3}$ Hz) glitch signals to test gravity
theories. Our simulations suggest that the experiment could measure the mass
and linear momentum lost via GW radiation, as well as constrain the mass of
gravitons, to a precision that is one order of magnitude better than the
current limit.

network MIMO systems with much lower backhaul load than approaches such as
Cloud Radio Access Network (Cloud-RAN) and coordinated multipoint (CoMP). In
this paper, we present a design guideline of engineering applicable PNC to
fulfil the request of high user densities in 5G wireless RAN infrastructure.
Unlike compute-and-forward and PNC design criteria for two-way relay channels,
the proposed guideline is designed for uplink of network MIMO (N-MIMO) systems.
We show that the proposed design criteria guarantee that 1) the whole system
operates over binary system; 2) the PNC functions utilised at each access point
overcome all singular fade states; 3) the destination can unambiguously recover
all source messages while the overall backhaul load remains at the lowest
level. We then develop a two-stage search algorithm to identify the optimum PNC
mapping functions which greatly reduces the real-time computational complexity.
The impact of estimated channel information and reduced number of singular fade
states in different QAM modulation schemes is studied in this paper. In
addition, a sub-optimal search method based on lookup table mechanism to
achieve further reduced computational complexity with limited performance loss
is presented. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes achieve low
outage probability with reduced backhaul load.

class variables is proposed. This model assumes that the distribution of the
observed data can be factorized into several independent blocks of variables.
Each block is assumed to follow a latent class model ({\it i.e.,} mixture with
conditional independence assumption). The proposed model includes variable
selection, as a special case, and is able to cope with the mixed-data setting.
The simplicity of the model allows to estimate the repartition of the variables
into blocks and the mixture parameters simultaneously, thus avoiding to run EM
algorithms for each possible repartition of variables into blocks. For the
proposed method, a model is defined by the number of blocks, the number of
clusters inside each block and the repartition of variables into block. Model
selection can be done with two information criteria, the BIC and the MICL, for
which an efficient optimization is proposed. The performances of the model are
investigated on simulated and real data. It is shown that the proposed method
gives a rich interpretation of the dataset at hand ({\it i.e.,} analysis of the

We compare these models to the observed emission lines of 254 HII regions of 13

models are created using the combination of the Binary Population and Spectral
Synthesis (bpass) code with the photoionization code cloudy to study the
differences caused by the inclusion of interacting binary stars in the stellar
population. We obtain agreement with the observed emission line ratios from the
nearby star-forming regions and discuss the effect of binary star evolution
pathways on the nebular ionization of H II regions. We find that at population
ages above 10 Myr, single-star models rapidly decrease in flux and ionization
strength, while binary-star model still produce strong flux and high O
III/H\b{eta} ratios. Our models can reproduce the metallicity of H II regions
from spiral galaxies but we find higher metallicities than previously estimated
for the H II regions from dwarf galaxies. Comparing the equivalent width of
H\b{eta} emission between mod- els and observations, we find that accounting
for ionizing photon leakage can affect age estimates for HII regions. When it
is included, the typical age derived for HII regions is 5Myr from single-star
models, and up to 10Myr with binary-star models. This is due to the existence
of binary-star evolution pathways which produce more hot WR and helium stars at
older ages. For future reference, we calculate new BPASS binary maximal
starburst lines as a function of metallicity, and for the total model
population, and present these in Appendix A.

$R_e = 0.4-1.1$ kpc and average star formation rates of $\simeq100-1200$

account using a pseudo-potential that reproduces measured nucleon-nucleon phase
shifts, and we find that attractive s-wave interactions enhance the density
response and suppress the spin response of neutron matter. The net effect of
neutron correlations is to strongly suppress backscattering. Moreover, we find
nearly exact scaling laws for the response functions, valid for the range $T =
5 - 10$ MeV and q < 30 MeV, allowing us to obtain analytic results for the
dynamic structure factors at second-order in the fugacity of the neutron gas.
We find that the modification of scattering rates depends on the energy and
momentum exchanged, implying that dynamical structure factors are essential to
describe neutrino decoupling in supernovae and neutron star mergers.

optically allowed transition from valence band maxima to conduction band
minima. It also reduces the band gap significantly, bringing it well in the
visible region. Simulation reveals comparable/higher absorption coefficient and
solar efficiency with respect to the state of the art photovoltaic absorber

the so-called long-duration bursts, most probably consist of an intrinsic
core-collapse to a black hole inside a super massive star. We point out that
this collapse alone will give a generic gravitational wave burst. It has been
shown that the strength of this burst depends on the dimensionless spin
parameter of the collapsing object. Under descent assumptions the gamma-ray
burst's central engine powers the explosion electromagnetically due to the
rotation of the newly formed black hole. We argue that the peak luminosity and
the isotropic energy of the gamma-ray burst can be associated with the spin of
the black hole, due to this mechanism. Since, both gravitational and
electromagnetic emission depend on the spin, they can be correlated and thus
give a straight estimate for the gravitational wave burst, when we have in hand
a gamma-ray burst with known distance. We discuss detectability limits for

dispersal include kin competition, inbreeding avoidance and spatiotemporal
variation in resources or habitat suitability. These factors differ in whether
they promote male and female dispersal equally strongly, and often selection on
dispersal of one sex depends on how much the other disperses. For example, for
inbreeding avoidance it can be sufficient that one sex disperses away from the
natal site. Attempts to understand sex-specific dispersal evolution have
created a rich body of theoretical literature, which we review here. We
highlight an interesting gap between empirical and theoretical literature. The
former associates different patterns of sex-biased dispersal with mating
systems, such as female-biased dispersal in monogamous birds and male-biased
dispersal in polygynous mammals. The predominant explanation is traceable back
to Greenwood's (1980) ideas of how successful philopatric or dispersing
individuals are at gaining mates or resources required to attract them. Theory,
however, has developed surprisingly independently of these ideas: predominant
ideas in theoretical work track how immigration and emigration change
relatedness patterns and alleviate competition for limiting resources,
typically considered sexually distinct, with breeding sites and fertilisable
females limiting reproductive success for females and males, respectively. We
show that the link between mating system and sex-biased dispersal is far from
resolved: there are studies showing that mating systems matter, but the
oft-stated association between polygyny and male-biased dispersal is not a
straightforward theoretical expectation... (full abstract in the PDF)

start up, we show that there is an apparent steady state banding at large times
even for shear rates such that the steady state flow curve allows for a
homogeneous flow. Thus, for aging soft glassy materials, the shear rate for
achieving homogeneous flow is not necessarily given by the steady-state flow
curve. We also observe that the transient and apparent steady state shear
banding behavior is not correlated to negative slope of the stress-strain

applicable to a certain transmission, referred to as channel state information
(CSI), can only be learned after the transmission has taken place and is
thereby delayed (outdated). In such systems, hybrid automatic repeat request
(HARQ) protocols are often used to achieve high throughput with low latency.
This paper put forth the family of expandable message space (EMS) protocols
that generalize the HARQ protocol and allow for rate adaptation based on
delayed CSI at the transmitter (CSIT). Assuming a block-fading channel, the
proposed EMS protocols are analyzed using dynamic programming. When full
delayed CSIT is available and there is a constraint on the average decoding
time, it is shown that the optimal zero outage EMS protocol has a particularly
simple operational interpretation and that the throughput is identical to that
of the backtrack retransmission request (BRQ) protocol. We also devise EMS

along the spine of a book, and edges of $G$ on the pages so that no two edges
on the same page intersect. the minimum number of pages in which a graph can be
embedded is called the \emph{page number}. The book-embedding of graphs may be
important in several technical applications, e.g., sorting with parallel
stacks, fault-tolerant processor arrays design, and layout problems with
application to very large scale integration (VLSI). Bernhart and Kainen firstly
considered the book-embedding of the planar graph and conjectured that its page
number can be made arbitrarily large [JCT, 1979, 320-331]. Heath [FOCS84] found
that planar graphs admit a seven-page book embedding. Later, Yannakakis proved
that four pages are necessary and sufficient for planar graphs in [STOC86].
Recently, Bekos et al. [STACS14] described an $O(n^{2})$ time algorithm of
two-page book embedding for 4-planar graphs. In this paper, we embed 5-planar
graphs into a book of three pages by an $O(n^{2})$ time algorithm.

multi-valley systems based on the semiclassical theory. Then we will review
experimental evidence and theoretical understanding of magnetoresistance in an
archetypal multi-valley system, where the electric conductivity is set by the
sum of the contributions of different valleys. Bulk bismuth has three valleys
with an extremely anisotropic effective mass. As a consequence, the
magnetoconductivity in each valley is extremely sensitive to the orientation of
the magnetic field. Therefore, a rotating magnetic field plays the role of a
valley valve tuning the contribution of each valley to the total conductivity.
In addition to this simple semi-classical effect, other phenomena arise in the
high-field limit as a consequence of an intricate Landau spectrum. In the
vicinity of the quantum limit, the orientation of magnetic field significantly
affects the distribution of carriers in each valley, namely, the valley
polarization is induced by the magnetic field. Moreover, experiment has found
that well beyond the quantum limit, one or two valleys become totally empty.
This is the only case in condensed-matter physics where a Fermi sea is
completely dried up by a magnetic field without a metal-insulator transition.
There have been two long-standing problems on bismuth near the quantum limit:
the large anisotropic Zeeman splitting of holes, and the extra peaks in quantum
oscillations, which cannot be assigned to any known Landau levels. These
problems are solved by taking into account the interband effect due to the
spin-orbit couplings for the former, and the contributions from the twinned
crystal for the latter. Up to here, the whole spectrum can be interpreted
within the one-particle theory. Finally, we will discuss transport and
thermodynamic signatures of breaking of the valley symmetry in this system.

Planetary Scientists and Astrobiologists. Analysis of huge planetary data from
space missions such as CoRoT and Kepler is directed ultimately at finding a
planet similar to Earth- the Earth's twin, and looking for potential
habitability. The Earth Similarity Index (ESI) is defined to find the
similarity with Earth, which ranges from 1 (Earth) to 0 (totally dissimilar to
Earth). ESI can be computed using four physical parameters of a planet, namely
radius, density, escape velocity and surface temperature. The surface
temperature entering surface ESI is a non-observable quantity and what we know
is only equilibrium temperature of exoplanets. We have established a relation
between surface and equilibrium temperatures using the data available for the
solar system objects to address the difficulty in determining surface
temperature. From the ESI analysis, we have found 20 Earth-like exoplanets with
ESI value above 0.8, which is set as the threshold. We are also interested in
Mars-like planets to search for planets that may host the extreme life For
example, methane-specific extremophile life form metabolism, for which a new
approach, called Mars Similarity Index (MSI) is introduced. MSI is defined in
the range between 1 (present Mars) and 0 (dissimilar to present Mars) and uses
the same physical parameters as that of ESI. We introduced another new approach
to study the potential habitability of exoplanets based on Cobb-Douglas
Function, multi-parametric function. This did not yield any encouraging
results.

This softening is quantified as an anticorrelation between the spectral index

lower luminosities (i.e., $\sim$ a few $\times$ $10^{30}$ erg/s) for a larger
sample of XRBs. We find evidence for a significant anticorrelation between the
spectral index and the luminosity for a group of NS binaries in the luminosity

correlation i.e., -2.12 $\pm$ 0.63. In contrast, BH binaries do not exhibit the
same behavior. We examine the possible dichotomy between NS and BH binaries in
terms of a Comptonization model that assumes a feedback mechanism between an
optically thin hot corona and an optically thick cool source of soft photons.
We gauge the NS-BH dichotomy by comparing the extracted corona temperatures,
Compton-y parameters and the Comptonization amplification factors: The mean
temperature of the NS group is found to be significantly lower than the
equivalent temperature for the BH group. The extracted Compton-y parameters and
the amplification factors follow the theoretically predicted relation with the

direct evaluation of the inclusive cross sections as measured by experiments.
We extend the applicability of GFMC in the quasielastic region to intermediate
momentum transfers by performing the calculations in a reference frame that
minimizes nucleon momenta. Additional relativistic effects in the kinematics
are accounted for employing the two-fragment model. In addition, we developed a
novel algorithm, based on the concept of first-kind scaling, to compute the
inclusive electromagnetic cross section of $^4$He through an accurate and
reliable interpolation of the response functions. A very good agreement is
obtained between theoretical and experimental cross sections for a variety of

a precise measurement of the spin, astrometric and orbital characteristics of
PSR J1618$-$3921. This was done with timing observations made at the Nan\c{c}ay

the formation and evolution of galaxies. Most of the relations employed for the
derivation of gas abundances have so far been derived from observations of
outer disk HII regions, despite the known differences between inner and outer
regions. Aims. Using integral field spectroscopy (IFS) observations we aim to
perform a systematic study and comparison of two inner and outer HII regions
samples. The spatial resolution of the IFS, the number of objects and the
homogeneity and coherence of the observations allow a complete characterization
of the main observational properties and differences of the regions. Methods.
We analyzed a sample of 725 inner HII regions and a sample of 671 outer HII
regions, all of them detected and extracted from the observations of a sample
of 263 nearby, isolated, spiral galaxies observed by the CALIFA survey.
Results. We find that inner HII regions show smaller equivalent widths, greater
extinction and luminosities, along with greater values of
[NII]{\lambda}6583/H{\alpha} and [OII]{\lambda}3727/[OIII]{\lambda}5007
emission-line ratios, indicating higher metallicites and lower ionization
parameters. Inner regions have also redder colors and higher photometric and
ionizing masses, although Mion/Mphot is slighty higher for the outer regions.
Conclusions. This work shows important observational differences between inner
and outer HII regions in star forming galaxies not previously studied in
detail. These differences indicate that inner regions have more evolved stellar
populations and are in a later evolution state with respect to outer regions,
which goes in line with the inside-out galaxy formation paradigm.

Accordingly, researchers attach utmost importance to the problem of state

introduce security awareness among state estimation algorithms without
requiring specialized hardware, or cryptographic techniques. We apply SecSens

provides good performance at run-time several order of magnitude faster than
the state of art solutions under the presence of powerful attacks. Our
algorithms are evaluated on a testbed with static nodes and a mobile quadrotor

with HST ACS/WFC data, from low main sequence till horizontal branch, we
calibrate some free parameters that are important for the evolution of low mass

calibration significantly improves the prediction of the RGB bump brightness.
Comparison with the observed RGB and HB luminosity functions also shows that
the evolutionary lifetimes are correctly predicted. As a further result of this
calibration process, we derive the age, distance modulus, reddening, and the
red giant branch mass loss for 47 Tuc. We apply the new calibration and
alpha-enhanced mixtures of the two 47 Tuc populations ( [alpha/Fe] ~0.4 and

non-STEM fields. Nevertheless, questionnaire items related to visibility,
quality, image, usefulness and expertise determine the main differences between
clusters, rather than age, gender or domain. Clusters involving a positive view
of Wikipedia and at least some frequency of use clearly outnumber those with a
strictly negative stance. This goes against the common view that faculty
members are mostly sceptical about Wikipedia. Environmental factors such as
academic culture and colleagues opinion are more important than faculty
personal characteristics, especially with respect to what they think about
Wikipedia quality.

which is a weighted combination of L2 loss and Adversarial loss. L2 loss
minimizes the difference between real and fake staff-less image. Adversarial
loss helps to retrieve more high quality textures in generated images. Thus our

harmonic, the transport is ballistic. We also find that on a periodic ring with
nonequilibrium initial conditions and no reservoirs, the energy current
oscillates without decay. Lastly, Poincar\'e sections of the 3-body case
indicate that for all tested initial conditions, the dynamics occur on a
3-dimensional manifold. These observations suggest that the $N$-body Toda chain

which the heat flux is ballistic - contrary to all current expectations.

input training data. When undesired biases concerning demographic groups are in
the training data, well-trained models will reflect those biases. We present a
framework for mitigating such biases by including a variable for the group of
interest and simultaneously learning a predictor and an adversary. The input to
the network X, here text or census data, produces a prediction Y, such as an
analogy completion or income bracket, while the adversary tries to model a
protected variable Z, here gender or zip code.
  The objective is to maximize the predictor's ability to predict Y while
minimizing the adversary's ability to predict Z. Applied to analogy completion,
this method results in accurate predictions that exhibit less evidence of
stereotyping Z. When applied to a classification task using the UCI Adult
(Census) Dataset, it results in a predictive model that does not lose much
accuracy while achieving very close to equality of odds (Hardt, et al., 2016).
The method is flexible and applicable to multiple definitions of fairness as
well as a wide range of gradient-based learning models, including both
regression and classification tasks.

the funding and publication system as well as the indicators used to measure
the scientific output, its quality and the research performance. This report
sheds light on how astronomers define high-quality research and how they think
that creating knowledge of value is encouraged or hampered by the evaluation
processes. We found that astronomers are realists who define scientific quality
on the basis of ""truth"" and are driven by curiosity. These two factors make up
their intrinsic values and motivation to perform Astronomy. Publication
pressure, arising from the requirements of ""the system"", creates an extrinsic
motivation to perform. This results in premature publications, low readability
and replicability, risk aversion and a focus on quantity rather than quality.
Hence, indicators do not merely represent quality, but also co-constitute what
counts as good research. While we observe such constitutive effects of
indicator use on research behaviour and content, we do not see that the
astronomer's intrinsic values are co-constituted. This gives rise to a
discrepancy between what is being measured by indicators and what astronomers
define as scientific quality; the so-called ""evaluation gap"". Findings on
constitutive effects and the evaluation gap in Astronomy lays out the
conceptual groundwork for further empirical research and for policy advice on
alternative evaluation practices and innovative indicators with the aim of

character recognition due to the emergence of deep learning techniques.
However, previous research mostly treated each Chinese character as one class
without explicitly considering its inherent structure, namely the radical
components with complicated geometry. In this study, we propose a novel
trajectory-based radical analysis network (TRAN) to firstly identify radicals
and analyze two-dimensional structures among radicals simultaneously, then
recognize Chinese characters by generating captions of them based on the
analysis of their internal radicals. The proposed TRAN employs recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) as both an encoder and a decoder. The RNN encoder makes full
use of online information by directly transforming handwriting trajectory into
high-level features. The RNN decoder aims at generating the caption by
detecting radicals and spatial structures through an attention model. The
manner of treating a Chinese character as a two-dimensional composition of
radicals can reduce the size of vocabulary and enable TRAN to possess the
capability of recognizing unseen Chinese character classes, only if the
corresponding radicals have been seen. Evaluated on CASIA-OLHWDB database, the
proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
whole-character modeling approach with a relative character error rate (CER)
reduction of 10%. Meanwhile, for the case of recognition of 500 unseen Chinese
characters, TRAN can achieve a character accuracy of about 60% while the
traditional whole-character method has no capability to handle them.

reaction centers within a cell architecture. These interfaces have well defined
specific heats and compressibilities, hence energy can propagate along them
analogous to sound waves. Lipid monolayers prepared at the air-water interface
of a Langmuir trough present an excellent model system to study such
propagations. Here we propose that recent observations of two-dimensional shock
waves observed in lipid monolayers also provide the evidence for the detonation
of shock waves at such interfaces, i.e. chemical energy stored in the interface
can be absorbed by a propagating shock front reinforcing it in the process. To
this end, we apply the classical theory in shock waves and detonation in the
context of a lipid interface and its thermodynamic state. Based on these
insights it is claimed that the observed self-sustaining waves in lipid
monolayers represent a detonation like phenomena that utilizes the latent heat
of phase transition of the lipids. However, the general nature of these
equations allows that other possible sources of chemical energy can contribute
to the propagating shock wave in a similar manner. Consequently, the
understanding is applied to the nerve pulse propagation that is believed to
represent a similar phenomenon, to obtain a qualitative understanding of the
pressure and temperature dependence of amplitude and threshold for action
potentials. While we mainly discuss the case of a stable detonation, the
problem of initiation of detonation at interfaces and corresponding heat
exchange is briefly discussed, which also suggests a role for thunder like
phenomena in pulse initiation.

quickly, and achieves more than $1-\varepsilon$ of the performance obtained by

energy level crossings in a region of the coupling parameter space. Several key
properties of the model are discussed, which exhibit a clear dependence on
whether the particle number is even or odd.

K-type main-sequence star, a red dwarf, and a circumbinary Saturnian planet. As
part of our study, we describe the system's habitable zone based on different
climate models. We also report on stability investigations for possible
Earth-mass Trojans while expanding a previous study by B. L. Quarles and
collaborators given in 2012. For the climate models we carefully consider the
relevance of the system's parameters. Furthermore, we pursue new stability
simulations for the Earth-mass objects starting along the orbit of Kepler-16b.
The eccentricity distribution as obtained prefers values close to circular,
whereas the inclination distribution remains flat. The stable solutions are
distributed near the co-orbital Lagrangian points, thus enhancing the
plausibility that Earth-mass Trojans might be able to exist in the
Kepler-16(AB) system.

similar data elements within cluster according to some similarity measurement.
But, clustering algorithms suffer from some drawbacks. Among the main weakness
including, selecting the initial cluster centres and the appropriate clusters
number is normally unknown. These weaknesses are considered the most
challenging tasks in clustering algorithms. This paper introduces a
comprehensive review of metahueristic search to solve fuzzy clustering
algorithms problems.

1500 volcanoes are considered active, but half of these have no ground-based
monitoring. Alternatively, satellite radar (InSAR) can be employed to observe
volcanic ground deformation, which has shown a significant statistical link to
eruptions. Modern satellites provide large coverage with high resolution
signals, leading to huge amounts of data. The explosion in data has brought
major challenges associated with timely dissemination of information and
distinguishing volcano deformation patterns from noise, which currently relies
on manual inspection. Moreover, volcano observatories still lack expertise to
exploit satellite datasets, particularly in developing countries. This paper
presents a novel approach to detect volcanic ground deformation automatically
from wrapped-phase InSAR images. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are
employed to detect unusual patterns within the radar data.
