oscillator with two different orders of nonlinear position-dependent
dissipation. We study the stability of the stationary states by using the
eigenvalues of Jacobian and evaluate the stability threshold thereafter. In the
first order nonlinear damping model, we discover that the temporal evolution of
both gain and lossy oscillators attains a complete convergence towards the
stable stationary state leading to the emergence of oscillation and amplitude
deaths. Also, the system displays a remarkable manifestation of transient chaos
in the lossy oscillator while the gain counterpart exhibits blow-up dynamics
for certain choice of initial conditions and control parameters. Employing an
external driving force on the loss oscillator, we find that the blow-up
dynamics can be controlled and a pure aperiodic state is achievable. On the
other hand, the second order nonlinear damping model yields a completely
different dynamics on contrary to the first order where the former reveals a
conventional quasi-periodic route to chaos upon decreasing the natural
frequency of both gain and loss oscillators. An electronic circuit scheme for
the experimental realization of the proposed system has also been put forward.

GUTs, in which the asymptotic gaugino $M_{1,2,3}$ masses are generated through
a combination of gravity and mirage mediated supersymmetry breaking. Due to the
contributions from mirage mediation, $M_{3}$ is always lighter than M_{1} and
M_{2}, and consequently for the range of asymptotic masses considered, the
gluino mass at low scale is bounded from above at about 4 TeV. We realize two
different regions, one in which the MSSM $\mu-$term is less than about 3 TeV.
This region yields a stop mass up to 5 TeV, and the stop mass is nearly
degenerate with the LSP neutralino for mass around 0.8 to 1.7 TeV. A stau mass
can be realized up to about 5 TeV, and the stau mass is approximately
degenerate with the LSP neutralino for mass around 2 to 3 TeV. In addition, an
A-funnel solution $m_{A}$ with mass $\sim 1.4-1.8$ TeV is realized. A second
region, on the other hand, arises for gluino around 1.1 TeV. The $\mu-$term is
rather large than 20 TeV, and the LSP neutralino is a bino-wino mixture. The
gluino mass ($\sim 0.8-1.2$ TeV) is nearly degenerate with the LSP neutralino
mass and hence, the gluino-neutralino coannihilation processes play a role in
reducing the relic abundance of LSP neutralino down to ranges allowed by the
current WMAP measurements. The two regions above can be distinguished through
the direct detection experiments. The first region with relatively low $\mu$
values yields Higgsino-like DM, whose scattering on the nucleus typically has a
large cross-section. We find that such solutions are still allowed by the
current results from the LUX experiment, and they will be severely tested by
the LUX-Zeplin experiment. The second region contains bino-wino DM whose
scattering cross-section is relatively low. These solutions are harder to rule
out in the foreseeable future.

RNA (mRNA) that serves as the track for the motor-like forward stepping of
individual ribosomes. In each step, a ribosome elongates a protein by a single
unit using the track also as a template for protein synthesis. But,
pre-fabricated, functionally competent, ribosomes are not available to begin
synthesis of protein; a subunit directionally scans the mRNA in search of the
pre-designated site where it is supposed to bind with the other subunit and
begin the synthesis of the corresponding protein. However, because of `leaky'
scanning, a fraction of the scanning subunits miss the target site and continue
their search beyond the first target. Sometimes such scanners successfully
identify the site that marks the site for initiation of the synthesis of a
different protein. In this paper, we develop an exclusion model, with three
interconvertible species of hard rods, to capture some of the key features of
these biological phenomena and study the effects of the interference of the
flow of the different species of rods on the same lattice. More specifically,

component in the leading approaches to realizing scalable, fault-tolerant, and
universal quantum computation. Related to non-stabilizer state manipulation is
the resource theory of non-stabilizer states, for which one of the goals is to
characterize and quantify non-stabilizerness of a quantum state. In this paper,
we introduce the family of thauma measures to quantify the amount of
non-stabilizerness in a quantum state, and we exploit this family of measures
to address several open questions in the resource theory of non-stabilizer
states. As a first application, we establish the hypothesis testing thauma as
an efficiently computable benchmark for the one-shot distillable
non-stabilizerness, which in turn leads to a variety of bounds on the rate at
which non-stabilizerness can be distilled, as well as on the overhead of
magic-state distillation. We then prove that the max-thauma can be used as an
efficiently computable tool in benchmarking the efficiency of magic-state
distillation and that it can outperform pervious approaches based on mana.
Finally, we use the min-thauma to bound a quantity known in the literature as
the ""regularized relative entropy of magic."" As a consequence of this bound, we
find that two classes of states with maximal mana, a previously established
non-stabilizerness measure, cannot be interconverted in the asymptotic regime
at a rate equal to one. This result resolves a basic question in the resource
theory of non-stabilizer states and reveals a difference between the resource
theory of non-stabilizer states and other resource theories such as
entanglement and coherence.

attraction for investigations of the fractional quantum Hall (fQH) states with

Graphene in the strong-field regime were made through exploiting the universal
low-energy effective description of Dirac fermions emerging from the nearest
neighbor hopping model of electrons on a honeycomb lattice. We highlight that
accounting for the next-nearest-neighbor hopping terms in doped Graphene can
lead to a unique redistribution of magnetic fluxes within the unit cell of the
lattice. While this affects all the fQH states, it has a striking effect at a
half-filled Landau-level state: it leads to a composite fermion state that is
equivalent to the doped topological Chern insulator on a honeycomb lattice. At
energies comparable to the Fermi energy, this state possesses a Haldane gap in
the bulk proportional to the next-nearest-neighbor hopping and density of
dopants. We argue that this microscopically derived energy gap survives the
projection to the lowest band. We also conjecture that the gap should be
present in a microscopic theory giving the recently proposed particle-hole
symmetric Dirac composite fermion scenario of the half-filled Landau-level. The
proposed gap is lower than the chemical potential, and is predicted to be
parametrically separated from the Dirac point in the latter description.
Finally we conclude by proposing experiments to detect this gap; the associated
boundary mode; and encourage cold-atom setups to test other predictions of the
theory.

the systematic effects and red noise present in the time series in an effort to
measure the change of the planet-to-star radius ratio

together, we find a slope in the transmission spectrum showing an increase of
the planetary radius towards blue wavelengths. A closer inspection to the
transmission spectrum of the individual data sets reveals that the first
transit presents this slope while the transmission spectrum of the second data
set is flat. Additionally we detect hints of Na absorption in the first night,

absorption excess found in the first transit observation are caused by
unocculted stellar spots. Modeling the contribution of unocculted spots to

$\delta=0.62^{+0.20}_{-0.17}$ and a spot-to-photosphere temperature difference

  In this paper, we give upper and lower bounds for the face-to-face evacuation

demonstrated unprecedented efficiency in wavefront manipulation by means of
relatively simple structures. Conventional one-dimensional (1D) gratings have a
profile modulation in one direction and a translation symmetry in the other. In
1D metagratings, the translation invariant direction is engineered at a
subwavelength scale, which allows one to accurately control polarization line
currents and, consequently, the scattering pattern. In bright contrast to
metasurfaces, metagratings cannot be described by means of surface impedances
(or local reflection and transmission coefficients). In this paper, we present
a simulation-based design approach to construct metagratings in the ""unit cell
by unit cell"" manner. It represents an analog of the local periodic
approximation that has been used to design space-modulated metasurfaces and
allows one to overcome the limitations of straightforward numerical
optimization and semianalytical procedures that have been used to date to
design metagratings. Electric and magnetic metagrating structures responding
to, respectively, transverse electric and transverse magnetic incident plane
waves are presented to validate the proposed design approach.

deformation, we use an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation. As a
result, moving and deforming hexahedral grid elements are individually mapped
onto a cube in the fixed reference system of coordinates. The proposed scheme
is constructed by using the skew-symmetric form of the Navier-Stokes equations,
which are discretized by using summation-by-parts spectral collocation
operators that preserve the conservation properties of the original governing
equations. Furthermore, the metric coefficients are approximated such that the
geometric conservation laws (GCL) are satisfied exactly on both static and
dynamic grids. To make the scheme entropy stable, a new entropy conservative
flux is derived for the 3-D Euler and Navier-Stokes equations on dynamic
unstructured grids. The new flux preserves the design order of accuracy of the
original spectral collocation scheme and guarantees the entropy conservation on
moving and deforming grids. We present numerical results demonstrating design

the oldest open problems in physics. The problem originates in the emission of
radiation by an accelerated charge, which must result with a loss of energy and
recoil of the charge, adding a correction to the well-known Lorentz force. When
radiation reaction is neglected, it is well known that the dynamics of a charge
in a plane-wave laser field are inevitably periodic. Here we investigate the
long-time dynamics of a charge in a plane wave and show that all current models
of radiation reaction strictly forbid periodic dynamics. Consequently, we find
that the loss of energy due to radiation reaction actually causes particles to
asymptotically accelerate to infinite kinetic energy. Such a phenomenon
persists even in weak laser fields and puts forward the possibility of testing
the open problem of radiation reaction through long-duration weak-field
precision measurements, rather than through strong-field experiments. Our
findings suggest realistic conditions for such measurements through the
asymptotic frequency shift and energy loss of a charge, which for example can
be detected in electron energy loss spectrometers in electron microscopes.

incorporates different sources of uncertainties to compute the restoration

Our approach accommodates current restoration strategies employed in recovery

calculated using our techniques significantly outperform the current recovery

spaces converge when the underlying spaces converge with respect to the
Gromov-Hausdorff-vague topology, and a certain uniform recurrence condition is
satisfied. Such a theorem finds particularly nice applications if the
resistance metric measure space is a metric measure tree. To illustrate this,
we state functional limit theorems in old and new examples of suitably rescaled
random walks in random environment on trees. First, we take a critical
Galton-Watson tree conditioned on its total progeny and a non-lattice branching
random walk on $\mathbb{R}^d$ indexed by it. Then, conditional on that, we
consider a biased random walk on the range of the preceding. Here, by
non-lattice we mean that distinct branches of the tree do not intersect once
mapped in $\mathbb{R}^d$. This excludes the possibility that the random walk on
the range may jump from one branch to the other without returning to the recent
common ancestor. We prove, after introducing the bias parameter
$\beta^{n^{-1/4}}$, for some $\beta>1$, that the biased random walk on the
range of a large critical non-lattice branching random walk converges to a
Brownian motion in a random Gaussian potential on Aldous' continuum random tree
(CRT). Our second new result introduces the scaling limit of the
edge-reinforced random walk on a size-conditioned Galton-Watson tree with
finite variance as a Brownian motion in a random Gaussian potential on the CRT

spin wave excitations on honeycomb nanoribbons characterized by armchair edge

boundary conditions are established by requiring that the bulk and edge spins
precess with the same frequency for any given spin wave eigenmode in these
systems. A set of characteristic boundary equations, common for bulk and edge
spin wave modes, are hence derived. The equations of motion for the spin
dynamics are then solved to determine the propagating and evanescent exchange
spin wave modes. We prove in general that the bulk spin wave dynamics is
discretized due to the finite width of the nanoribbon. For an isotropic
magnetic nanoribbon, the Dirac cone is reduced to a single linear dispersion
curve due to this discretization. The number and wavelengths of allowed bulk
modes for isotropic and anisotropic nanoribbons are determined from the derived
characteristic boundary equations. As witnessed by our numerical results for
different examples it is shown that the characteristics of these modes depend
on the width of the nanoribbon and its antiferromagnetic anisotropy. Further,
anisotropic nanoribbons, even those with the slightest anisotropy, present
evanescent modes with non-linear dispersion relations. The spatial variation of
the amplitudes of the evanescent exchange spin waves across the finite widths
of the nanoribbons, is found to be strongly dependent on the system magnetic
anisotropy and its width. The developed theoretical approach is general and can
be applied for nanoribbons with all types of boundary edges.

global solutions corresponding to the near-horizon behavior of $(p,q)$-string
junctions. We identify the type of singularity in $\mathcal A_\pm$ needed at
the boundary of $\Sigma$ to match the solutions locally onto the classic
$(p,q)$-string solution. We construct solutions with multiple $(p,q)$-strings,
but the existence of geodesically complete solutions remains unsettled. In a
second part we construct multi-parameter families of non-compact globally
regular and geodesically complete solutions with asymptotic regions and an
$AdS_2$ throat which caps off smoothly.

to address this problem by learning better feature representations using

convergence range which could be improved greatly using learned approaches.
Based on this observation, we propose a novel end-to-end network, RegNet, to
learn the optimization of image-to-image pose registration. By jointly learning
feature representation for each pixel and partial derivatives that replace
handcrafted ones (e.g., numerical differentiation) in the optimization step,
the neural network facilitates end-to-end optimization. The energy landscape is
constrained on both the feature representation and the learned Jacobian, hence
providing more flexibility for the optimization as a consequence leads to more
robust and faster convergence. In a series of experiments, including a broad
ablation study, we demonstrate that RegNet is able to converge for
large-baseline image pairs with fewer iterations.

networks (ConvNets) to extract frame-wise deep features which are pooled
temporally to generate the video-level representations. However, 2D ConvNets
lose temporal input information immediately after the convolution, and a
separate temporal pooling is limited in capturing human motion in shorter
sequences. To this end, we present a \textit{global} video representation (3D
PersonVLAD), complementary to 3D ConvNets as a novel layer to capture the
appearance and motion dynamics in full-length videos. However, encoding each
video frame in its entirety and computing an aggregate global representation
across all frames is tremendously challenging due to occlusions and
misalignments. To resolve this, our proposed network is further augmented with

12268 within 36 hours from 2015 January 29 to 30, during which a flux rope was
formed and three M-class and three C-class flares were triggered without
coronal mass ejections. During the evolution of the active region, the flare
emission seen in the H$\alpha$ and ultraviolet wavebands changed from a
circular shape (plus an adjacent conjugated ribbon and a remote ribbon) to
three relatively straight and parallel ribbons. Based on a series of
reconstructed nonlinear force-free fields, we find sheared or twisted magnetic
field lines and a large-scale quasi-separatrix layer (QSL) associated with 3D
null points in a quadrupolar magnetic field. These features always existed and
constantly evolved during the two days. The twist of the flux rope was
gradually accumulated that eventually led to its instability. Around the flux
rope, there were some topological structures, including a bald patch, a
hyperbolic flux tube and a torus QSL. We discuss how the particular magnetic
structure and its evolution produce the flare emission. In particular, the
bifurcation of the flux rope can explain the transition of the flares from
circular to parallel ribbons. We propose a two-stage evolution of the magnetic
structure and its associated flares. In the first stage, sheared arcades under
the dome-like large-scale QSL were gradually transformed into a flux rope
through magnetic reconnection, which produced the circular ribbon flare. In the
second stage, the flux rope bifurcated to form the three relatively straight
and parallel flare ribbons.

considerably smaller than that of light hadrons ($\pi,K$ and $p$), but
comparable to that of hadrons containing multiple strange quarks
($\phi,\Xi^-$), indicating that $D^0$ mesons kinetically decouple from the

factors re-affirm that charm quarks suffer large amount of energy loss in the

expectation from model predictions that charm quarks gain sizable collective

growth is infeasible to form abrupt heterostructures with large
lattice-mismatch while mechanical-thermal bonding results in a high density of
interface defects and therefore severely limits device applications. Here we
show an ultra-thin oxide-interfaced approach for the successful formation of
lattice-mismatched semiconductor heterostructures. Following the depiction of a
theory on the role of interface oxide in forming the heterostructures, we
describe experimental demonstrations of Ge/Si (diamond lattices), Si/GaAs (zinc
blende lattice), GaAs/GaN (hexagon lattice), and Si/GaN heterostructures.
Extraordinary electrical performances in terms of ideality factor, current
on/off ratio, and reverse breakdown voltage are measured from p-n diodes
fabricated from the four types of heterostructures, significantly outperforming
diodes derived from other methods. Our demonstrations indicate the versatility
of the ultra-thin-oxide-interface approach in forming lattice-mismatched
heterostructures, open up a much larger possibility for material combinations
for heterostructures, and pave the way toward broader applications in

a causal set discretisation of a slab of 2d and 4d de Sitter spacetime, we find
the causal set SJ vacuum for a range of masses $m \geq 0$ of the free scalar
field. While our simulations are limited to a finite volume slab of global de
Sitter spacetime, they show good convergence as the volume is increased. We
find that the 4d causal set SJ vacuum shows a significant departure from the
continuum Motolla-Allen $\alpha$-vacua. Moreover, the causal set SJ vacuum is
well-defined for both the minimally coupled massless $m=0$ and the conformally
coupled massless $m=m_c$ cases. This is at odds with earlier work on the
continuum de Sitter SJ vacuum where it was argued that the continuum SJ vacuum
is ill-defined for these masses. Our results hint at an important tension
between the discrete and continuum behaviour of the SJ vacuum in de Sitter and
suggest that the former cannot in general be identified with the Mottola-Allen
$\alpha$-vacua even for $m>0$.

  Optimization",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Consider the minimization of a nonconvex differentiable function over a
polyhedron. A popular primal-dual first-order method for this problem is to
perform a gradient projection iteration for the augmented Lagrangian function
and then update the dual multiplier vector using the constraint residual.
However, numerical examples show that this approach can exhibit ""oscillation""
and may not converge. In this paper, we propose a proximal alternating
direction method of multipliers for the multi-block version of this problem. A
distinctive feature of this method is the introduction of a ""smoothed"" (i.e.,
exponentially weighted) sequence of primal iterates, and the inclusion, at each
iteration, to the augmented Lagrangian function a quadratic proximal term
centered at the current smoothed primal iterate. The resulting proximal
augmented Lagrangian function is inexactly minimized (via a gradient projection
step) at each iteration while the dual multiplier vector is updated using the
residual of the linear constraints. When the primal and dual stepsizes are
chosen sufficiently small, we show that suitable ""smoothing"" can stabilize the
""oscillation"", and the iterates of the new proximal ADMM algorithm converge to
a stationary point under some mild regularity conditions. Furthermore, when the
objective function is quadratic, we establish the linear convergence of the
algorithm. Our proof is based on a new potential function and a novel use of
error bounds.

architecture for modeling the entire translation process. The encoder
summarizes the representation of input sentence from scratch, which is
potentially a problem if the sentence is ambiguous. When translating a text,
humans often create an initial understanding of the source sentence and then
incrementally refine it along the translation on the target side. Starting from
this intuition, we propose a novel encoder-refiner-decoder framework, which
dynamically refines the source representations based on the generated
target-side information at each decoding step. Since the refining operations
are time-consuming, we propose a strategy, leveraging the power of
reinforcement learning models, to decide when to refine at specific decoding
steps. Experimental results on both Chinese-English and English-German
translation tasks show that the proposed approach significantly and
consistently improves translation performance over the standard encoder-decoder
framework. Furthermore, when refining strategy is applied, results still show
reasonable improvement over the baseline without much decrease in decoding

a subsequent selection of significant covariates, has cross-validation
performance slightly better than random forests. We also find that prediction

chiral condensate and spin polarization condensation for different values of
tensor coupling. Spin polarization in the case of 2+1 flavor is different from
two flavor case because of additional F$_8$ condensate associated with
$\lambda_8^f$ flavor generator. We find a non-zero value of the two spin
condensates in the chirally restored phase. Beyond a certain temperature the
spin polarization condensates vanish for rather large quark chemical
potentials. The spin condensates affect the chiral phase transition, quark
masses, and the quark dispersion relation. The spin polarization condensate
appears only in the chiral restored phase for light quarks. For large enough
tensor couplings, it is observed that the spin polarization condensate acts as
a catalyst for chiral symmetry restoration. Thermodynamic behavior of $F_3$ and
$F_8$ are found to be different and they affect the quark masses differently.

  Convolutional Neural Networks"", accepted at WACV 2018",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently there has been a lot of work on pruning filters from deep
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the intention of reducing
computations.The key idea is to rank the filters based on a certain criterion
(say, l1-norm) and retain only the top ranked filters. Once the low scoring
filters are pruned away the remainder of the network is fine tuned and is shown
to give performance comparable to the original unpruned network. In this work,
we report experiments which suggest that the comparable performance of the
pruned network is not due to the specific criterion chosen but due to the
inherent plasticity of deep neural networks which allows them to recover from
the loss of pruned filters once the rest of the filters are fine-tuned.
Specifically we show counter-intuitive results wherein by randomly pruning
25-50% filters from deep CNNs we are able to obtain the same performance as
obtained by using state-of-the-art pruning methods. We empirically validate our
claims by doing an exhaustive evaluation with VGG-16 and ResNet-50. We also
evaluate a real world scenario where a CNN trained on all 1000 ImageNet classes
needs to be tested on only a small set of classes at test time (say, only
animals). We create a new benchmark dataset from ImageNet to evaluate such
class specific pruning and show that even here a random pruning strategy gives
close to state-of-the-art performance. Unlike existing approaches which mainly
focus on the task of image classification, in this work we also report results
on object detection and image segmentation. We show that using a simple random
pruning strategy we can achieve significant speed up in object detection (74%
improvement in fps) while retaining the same accuracy as that of the original
Faster RCNN model. Similarly we show that the performance of a pruned
Segmentation Network (SegNet) is actually very similar to that of the original
unpruned SegNet.

neural networks based on fully convolutional architecture are trained on large

the fact that weak values are experimentally accessible (as an ensemble average

strengthens the idea that understanding the intrinsic (unperturbed) dynamics of
quantum systems is possible and useful in a given Modal theory. As examples of

single crystals and epitaxial thin films for exploring basic physical
quantities. Although several properties of FBS are similar to the cuprates
(large upper critical fields, resulting from a short coherence lengths, and
small carrier density), others are distinctly different. For instance, in FBS
the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter is most likely not a d-wave
but an s+-wave, depending on the stoichiometry, crystallographic system, and
doping level. Additionally, the critical current densities of FBS are less
sensitive to the presence of grain boundaries (GBs) than those of the high-Tc
cuprates. These features are highly beneficial for the realization of cheaper
conductors for high-field magnets at low temperatures. Indeed, several groups
have demonstrated FBS thin films on technical metallic substrates and
powder-in-tube processed FBS wires as proof-of-principle studies for conductor
applications. FBS on technical substrates also give many opportunities for
studying how GB networks affect the critical current and how uniaxial strain
impacts the superconducting properties. In this article, we review FBS thin
films, especially on technical metallic substrates, and focus on
application-relevant properties like pinning improvement by natural and
artificial defects as well as the transparency of GBs and GB networks. The
recent development of FBS thin films on technical substrates and their

not be guaranteed in practice. Furthermore, the channel estimation error is
applied to estimate the channel information wherein its priori of variance is
assumed to be known. The impact of the number of coordinated base stations
(BSs) on downlink CoMP NOMA is investigated. Users are classified into one of
two groups according to their position within the cell, namely cell-center user
(CCU) and cell-edge user (CEU). In this paper, ergodic capacity and sum
capacity for both CCU and CEU are derived as closed form. In addition, various
experiments are conducted with different parameters such as SNR, error
variance, and power allocation to show their impact on the CoMP method. The
results show that CoMP NOMA outperforms the CoMP orthogonal multiple access
(OMA) wherein the condition of the channel impacts the performance of CoMP NOMA
less. It is worth noting that a higher number of coordinated BSs enhances the
total capacity of CoMP NOMA. Finally, the performance analysis is validated due

there is a $d$-variate polynomial $P$ of degree at most $D$ so that each

Our approach exploits the technique of quantifier elimination combined with

induced in the vacuum. It was also shown that this ""magnetic Casimir effect"" of
the vacuum is closely related to another quantum effect of the vacuum, the Weyl
anomaly. Furthermore, the phenomena can be understood in terms of the
holography of the boundary system. In this paper, we generalize this four
dimensional effect to six dimensions. We use the AdS/BCFT holography to show
that in the presence of a 3-form magnetic field strength $H$,a string current
is induced in a six dimensional boundary conformal field theory. This allows us
to determine the gauge field contribution to the Weyl anomaly in six
dimensional conformal field theory in a $H$-flux background. For the (2,0)
superconformal field theory of $N$ M5-branes, the current has a magnitude
proportional to $N^3$ for large $N$. This suggests that the degree of freedoms
scales as $N^3$ in the (2,0) superconformal theory of $N$ multiple M5-branes.
The prediction we have for the Weyl anomaly is a new criteria that the (2,0)

travelling waves connecting a Lax shock for the underlying Euler system. The
existence of monotone profiles is proved for sufficiently small shocks; while
the case of large shocks leads to the (global) existence for an oscillatory
profile, where dispersion plays a significant role. The spectral analysis of
the linearized problem about a profile is also provided. In particular, we
derive a sufficient condition for the stability of the essential spectrum and
we estimate the maximum modulus of the eigenvalues in the unstable plane, using
a careful analysis of the Evans function.

fraction $\alpha$, while at high turbulence levels the enhancement in $D_{xx}$
is negligible. When normalizing by the time scale of successive bubble passage,
the effective diffusivity can be modelled as a sole function of the gas volume
fraction $\alpha^* \equiv \alpha/\alpha_c$, where $\alpha_c$ is a theoretically
estimated critical gas volume fraction. The present explorative study provides
insights into modeling the mixing induced by high Reynolds number bubbles in
turbulent flows.

hard-sphere [poly(methylmethacrylate)-poly(lauryl methacrylate) (PMMA-PLMA)]
colloids at a water-oil interface has a negligible unscreened-dipole
contribution, suggesting that models previously developed for charged particles
at liquid interfaces are not necessarily applicable to sterically stabilized
particles. Interparticle potentials, $U(r)$, are extracted from radial
distribution functions [$g(r)$, measured by fluorescence microscopy] via
Ornstein-Zernike inversion and via a reverse Monte Carlo scheme. The results
are then validated by particle tracking in a blinking optical trap. Using a
Bayesian model comparison, we find that our PMMA-PLMA data is better described
by a screened monopole only rather than a functional form having a screened
monopole plus an unscreened dipole term. We postulate that the long range
repulsion we observe arises mainly through interactions between neutral holes
on a charged interface, i.e., the charge of the liquid interface cannot, in
general, be ignored. In agreement with this interpretation, we find that the
interaction can be tuned by varying salt concentration in the aqueous phase.
Inspired by recent theoretical work on point charges at dielectric interfaces,
which we explain is relevant here, we show that a screened $\frac{1}{r^2}$ term
can also be used to fit our data. Finally, we present measurements for
poly(methyl methacrylate)-poly(12-hydroxystearic acid) (PMMA-PHSA) particles at
a water-oil interface. These suggest that, for PMMA-PHSA particles, there is an
additional contribution to the interaction potential. This is in line with our
optical-tweezer measurements for PMMA-PHSA colloids in bulk oil, which indicate
that they are slightly charged.

sequences of a person across multiple camera views. Generally, features
directly extracted from a single frame suffer from occlusion, blur,
illumination and posture changes. This leads to false activation or missing
activation in some regions, which corrupts the appearance and motion
representation. How to explore the abundant spatial-temporal information in
video sequences is the key to solve this problem. To this end, we propose a
Refining Recurrent Unit (RRU) that recovers the missing parts and suppresses
noisy parts of the current frame's features by referring historical frames.
With RRU, the quality of each frame's appearance representation is improved.
Then we use the Spatial-Temporal clues Integration Module (STIM) to mine the
spatial-temporal information from those upgraded features. Meanwhile, the
multi-level training objective is used to enhance the capability of RRU and
STIM. Through the cooperation of those modules, the spatial and temporal
features mutually promote each other and the final spatial-temporal feature
representation is more discriminative and robust. Extensive experiments are
conducted on three challenging datasets, i.e., iLIDS-VID, PRID-2011 and MARS.
The experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods of video-based person re-identification on iLIDS-VID

Each V poses a number of challenges that have implications on the energy
efficiency of the underlying networks carrying the big data. Addressing the
veracity of the data is a more serious challenge to data scientists, since they
need to distinguish between the meaningful data and the dirty data. In this
article, we investigate the impact of big data veracity on greening IP by
developing a Mixed Integer Linear Programming, MILP, model that encapsulates
the distinctive features of veracity. In our analyses, the big data network was
greened by cleansing the raw big data before processing and then progressively
processing the cleansed big data at strategic locations, dubbed processing
nodes, PNs. The PNs are built into the network along the path from the sources
to the centralized datacenters. At each PN, the cleansed data was processed and
smaller volume of useful information was extracted progressively, thereby,
reducing the network power consumption. Furthermore, a backup for the cleansed
data was stored in an optimally selected Backup Node, BN. We evaluated the
network power saving that can be achieved by a green big data network compared
to the classical non-progressive approach. We obtained up to 52 percent network
power savings, on average, in the green big data approach compared to the

in a wireless communication network comprised of a source, a destination , an
external jammer and an eavesdropper. In the covert communication, the level of
transmit power is low and hence a source with multiple antennas can be adopted
to send the information toward the single antenna destination while
concurrently, the jammer transmits an artificial noise signal. For this system
model, we consider a scenario where the source is forced to select one or
several of its antennas to transmit its confidential information due to its
limited RF chains. Furthermore, we consider two different jamming scenarios to
support our covert communication: 1) The destination is unable to cancel the
jamming signal, 2) The destination can subtract the jamming signal. For such a
communication network, our aim is to maximize the covert rate subject to power
constraint and covert communication requirement. In the first scenario, the
optimization problem is non-convex, and hence, it can be solved through using
Difference of Convex function (DC) method while the optimization problem of the
second scenario is intrinsically convex. Our numerical results show that the
higher the number of selected antennas at the transmitter, the higher the

poses unprecedented requirements on device control. Besides the residual
interaction with the environment, causing environment-induced decoherence,
uncontrolled parameters in the system itself -- disorder -- remains as a
substantial factor limiting the precision and thus the performance of devices.
These perturbations may arise, for instance, due to imperfect sample
production, stray fields, or finite accuracy of control electronics.
Disorder-dressed quantum evolution means a unifying framework, based on quantum
master equations, to analyze how these detrimental influences cause deviations
from the desired system dynamics. This description may thus contribute to
unveiling and mitigating disorder effects towards robust schemes. To
demonstrate the broad scope of this framework, we evaluate two distinct
scenarios: a central spin immersed in an isotropic spin bath, and a random mass
Dirac particle. In the former scenario, we demonstrate how the disorder average
reflects purity oscillations, indicating the time- and state-dependent severity
of the disorder impact. In the latter scenario, we discuss disorder-induced
backscattering and disorder-induced Zitterbewegung as consequences of the
breakup of spin-momentum locking.

the modeling of the behavioral reports into a sequence of words, along with
advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques
for automatic engineering of relevant security features to detect and attribute
malware without the investigator intervention. More precisely, we propose to

most medical images are acquired following standard protocols, thus organs in
the image are typically at a similar location and possess similar geometrical
characteristics (e.g. scale, aspect-ratio, etc.). Therefore, medical image
acquisition protocols hold critical localization and geometric information that
can be incorporated for faster and more accurate detection. This paper presents
a novel attention mechanism for the detection of organs by incorporating
imaging protocol information. Our novel selective attention approach (i)
effectively shrinks the search space inside the feature map, (ii) appends
useful localization information to the hypothesized proposal for the detection
architecture to learn where to look for each organ, and (iii) modifies the
pyramid of regression references in the RPN by incorporating organ- and
modality-specific information, which results in additional time reduction. We
evaluated the proposed framework on a dataset of 768 chest X-ray images

performance for the detection of the lung field compared to the

are more isolated than the ionized regions, this is the motivation for the

two-photon absorption (TPA) process, while tuning the excitation wavelength.
This phenomenon occurs when the incoming femtosecond (fs) laser photon energy
is higher than a threshold energy. Intriguingly, this phenomenon also occurs in
other kinds of iodide perovskite materials. Moreover, two more shorter
wavelength peaks exhibit and become prominent when the excitation photon energy
is being tuned in the high energy wavelength spectrum, while laser power is
remained constant. However, the spectral PL energy window between the original
material peak and the first high energy peak can vary based on the
optoelectronic properties of the prepared films. The same phenomenon of
reversible PL peak is also observed in various iodide based organic-inorganic
halides as well as all-inorganic perovskite single crystals and polycrystals.
We attribute to the reversible PL peak to the photoinduced structural
deformation and the associated change in optical bandgap of iodide perovskites
under the femtosecond laser excitation. Our findings will introduce a new
degree of freedom in future research as well as adding new functionalities to

\cite{ref1}. In this paper, this extended reconstruction method is utilized to
investigate the nature of the scalar potentials of the most extended action of
$F(T)$-gravity context. First, a general formalism is formulated and then it is
utilized for considering some well-known special cases including `Barotropic
Fluid', `Cosmological Constant', and `Modified Chaplygin Gas'. The analysis of
the results is carried out by the use of the $\mathfrak{B}\text{-function}$
method which has recently been suggested by the author. As we know, assuming a
proportional relation between the scale factor of the $x\text{-direction}$ and
the scale factors of $y$ and $z$ directions (i.e. $A=B^{m}$) in dealing with
LRS Bianchi-I background is prevalent. Pursuant to observational data, the
correct physical range of $m$ is extracted. It is demonstrated that, unlike
several papers, $m$ is very close to $1$. Some interesting discussions about
the modified and generalized Chaplygin gases are performed. The ranges of the
amounts of free parameters of the various types of Chaplygin gases are
corrected according to observational data. It is demonstrated that the
generalized Chaplygin gas model namely $P=-\sigma_{2}/\rho^{\nu}$ may be
developed as $P=-\sigma_{2}/\rho^{\nu(t)}$ (i.e. $\nu=const. \longrightarrow
\nu=\nu(t)$). Ultimately, by combining ref. \cite{ref1} and the current paper,
a general prescription is recommended for the reconstruction of the potentials

and the MicroMed sensor of the Dust Complex. As a part of the instruments
developing and the acquisition of martian analogous data, our team has carried
out various campaigns in the Sahara desert, to study the environment and the
lifting phenomena that are expected on Mars. We monitored the dust lifting
events by acquiring, for the first time in literature, synchronous measurement
of meteorological data, atmospheric electric field, saltation activity and
suspended dust concentration. Currently, this is the most complete data set
available for the study of the dust lifting processes. We worked on the
development of proper detection algorithms to individuate the dust events
acquired in the surveys, applicable also to the future martian missions. We
studied the characteristic of the observed dust storm and dust devils activity,
focusing on their electric proprieties. In particular, we obtained the first
experimental indications of how the induced electric field is related to the

realistic-looking fingerprint images, as they are not powerful enough to
capture the complicated texture representation in fingerprint images. In this
work, we present a machine learning framework based on generative adversarial
networks (GAN), which is able to generate fingerprint images sampled from a
prior distribution (learned from a set of training images). We also add a
suitable regularization term to the loss function, to impose the connectivity
of generated fingerprint images. This is highly desirable for fingerprints, as
the lines in each finger are usually connected. We apply this framework to two
popular fingerprint databases, and generate images which look very realistic,
and similar to the samples in those databases. Through experimental results, we
show that the generated fingerprint images have a good diversity, and are able
to capture different parts of the prior distribution. We also evaluate the
Frechet Inception distance (FID) of our proposed model, and show that our model
is able to achieve good quantitative performance in terms of this score.

framework for image and video captioning. Most existing decoders apply the
attention mechanism to every generated word including both visual words (e.g.,
""gun"" and ""shooting"") and non-visual words (e.g. ""the"", ""a""). However, these
non-visual words can be easily predicted using natural language model without
considering visual signals or attention. Imposing attention mechanism on
non-visual words could mislead and decrease the overall performance of visual
captioning. Furthermore, the hierarchy of LSTMs enables more complex
representation of visual data, capturing information at different scales. To
address these issues, we propose a hierarchical LSTM with adaptive attention
(hLSTMat) approach for image and video captioning. Specifically, the proposed
framework utilizes the spatial or temporal attention for selecting specific
regions or frames to predict the related words, while the adaptive attention is
for deciding whether to depend on the visual information or the language
context information. Also, a hierarchical LSTMs is designed to simultaneously
consider both low-level visual information and high-level language context
information to support the caption generation. We initially design our hLSTMat
for video captioning task. Then, we further refine it and apply it to image

may be used to create a new object called a training vector field (TVF). This
object assigns a vector to each point in the reservoir within the training

TVF is defined as an approximation of the tangent line at each point in the

geological interpretation. Because hand-picking the locations of the horizon is
a time-consuming process, automated computational methods were developed
starting three decades ago. Older techniques for such picking include
interpolation of control points however, in recent years neural networks have
been used for this task. Until now, most networks trained on small patches from
larger images. This limits the networks ability to learn from large-scale
geologic structures. Moreover, currently available networks and training
strategies require label patches that have full and continuous annotations,
which are also time-consuming to generate.
  We propose a projected loss-function for training convolutional networks with
a multi-resolution structure, including variants of the U-net. Our networks
learn from a small number of large seismic images without creating patches. The
projected loss-function enables training on labels with just a few annotated
pixels and has no issue with the other unknown label pixels. Training uses all
data without reserving some for validation. Only the labels are split into
training/testing. Contrary to other work on horizon tracking, we train the
network to perform non-linear regression, and not classification. As such, we
propose labels as the convolution of a Gaussian kernel and the known horizon
locations that indicate uncertainty in the labels. The network output is the
probability of the horizon location. We demonstrate the proposed computational
ingredients on two different datasets, for horizon extrapolation and
interpolation. We show that the predictions of our methodology are accurate
even in areas far from known horizon locations because our learning strategy
exploits all data in large seismic images.

acquisition of complex controllers that can map sensory inputs directly to
low-level actions. In the domain of robotic locomotion, deep RL could enable
learning locomotion skills with minimal engineering and without an explicit
model of the robot dynamics. Unfortunately, applying deep RL to real-world
robotic tasks is exceptionally difficult, primarily due to poor sample
complexity and sensitivity to hyperparameters. While hyperparameters can be
easily tuned in simulated domains, tuning may be prohibitively expensive on
physical systems, such as legged robots, that can be damaged through extensive
trial-and-error learning. In this paper, we propose a sample-efficient deep RL
algorithm based on maximum entropy RL that requires minimal per-task tuning and
only a modest number of trials to learn neural network policies. We apply this
method to learning walking gaits on a real-world Minitaur robot. Our method can
acquire a stable gait from scratch directly in the real world in about two
hours, without relying on any model or simulation, and the resulting policy is
robust to moderate variations in the environment. We further show that our
algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulated benchmarks with a
single set of hyperparameters. Videos of training and the learned policy can be
found on the project website.

ending pursuits of public transit agencies. One of the proposed methods to
achieve both goals for subway service is to implement real time train arriving
countdown clocks in subway stations. Metropolitan Transportation Authority
(MTA) of New York City (NYC) chose to install such countdown clocks in their
stations starting from 2007 on a selection of subway lines. Due to the recent
development of Bluetooth Beacon technology, the MTA could now install countdown
clocks and train trackers in a non intrusive manner with much faster speed. As
a result, the MTA is aiming to install countdown clocks in every subway station
on every line. However, with such an aggressive plan, the impact of countdown
clocks on subway ridership has not been fully studied. This paper proposes
using Panel Regression methods, specifically, Random Effect (RE) model and
Fixed Effect (FE) model to quantify the impact of countdown clocks on subway
ridership. Machine Learning methods, namely Random Forest (RF) with AdaBoost
and Decision Tree (DT) Regression, are also used as alternative data driven
approaches for the FE and RE model. The results show that for the G line
service, which runs between Brooklyn and Queens, the introduction of countdown
clocks could increase weekly ridership by about 1783 per station. The study
also found that the machine learning methods provide better accuracy in
predicting the ridership than RE and FE models.

  Separation of the Absolute Quantum Motions","13 pages",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of the reason of physical motion needs a review in the framework
of quantum theory. The Aristotle's mistake, Galileo-Newton progress, Einstein
physical geometry established the fundamental role of the spacetime geometry in
the motion of fields and bodies. Quantum theory poses a new question about the
motion of the quantum states and its reason in the quantum state space. The
standard approach of quantum theory uses so-called method of the classical
analogy where the action functional contains in the additive manner three
terms: matter (free particles) + free fields + interaction term. Such approach
leads to the quantum state space as some space of functions defined on the
spacetime. I think if one try to understand the peculiarity of the
self-interacting quantum particles together with its ""field shell"" then the
classical scheme should be replaced. Then the role of the spacetime should be
revised: the space of the unlocated pure quantum degrees of freedom and its
geometry will play the fundamental role and the local dynamical spacetime
arises as representation of the internal quantum motions (inverse
representation).
  I will discuss in this work a small but important change in the formulation
of the field equations for the energy-momentum, orbital momentum and kinetic
momentum of the self-interacting electron.
