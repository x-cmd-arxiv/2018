the augmented evaporation dynamics of paramagnetic pendent droplets in the
presence of a magnetic field stimulus. Literature provides information that
solutal advection and solutal Marangoni effect lead to enhancement of
evaporation in droplets with ionic inclusions. The major crux of the present
article remains to modulate the thermosolutal advection with the aid of
magnetic field and comprehend the dynamics of the evaporation process under
such complex multiphysics interactions. Experimental observations reveal that
the evaporation rate enhances as a direct function of the magnetic moment of
the solvated magnetic element ions, thereby pinpointing at the magnetophoretic
and magneto-solutal advection. Additionally, flow visualization by PIV
illustrates that the internal advection currents within the droplet are
strengthened in magnitude as well as distorted in orientation by the magnetic
field. A mathematical formalism based on magnetothermal and magnetosolutal
advection effects has been proposed via scaling analysis of the species and
energy conservation equations. The formalism takes into account all major
governing factors such as the magnetothermal and magnetosolutal Marangoni
numbers, magneto Prandtl and magneto Schmidt numbers and the Hartmann number.
The modeling establishes the magnetosolutal advection component to be the
domineering factor in augmented evaporation dynamics. Accurate validation of
the experimental internal circulation velocity is obtained from the proposed
model. The present study reveals rich insight on the magneto thermosolutal
hydrodynamics aspects in paramagnetic droplets.

platforms to explore novel quantum physics, in particular the exotic

of SO coupling and novel quantum states for ultracold atoms. Here we review the
physics of the SO coupled quantum gases, focusing on the latest theoretical and
experimental progresses of realizing SO couplings beyond one-dimension (1D),
and the further investigation of novel topological quantum phases in such
systems, including the topological insulating phases and topological
superfluids. A pedagogical introduction to the SO coupling for ultracold atoms
and topological quantum phases is presented. We show that the so-called optical
Raman lattice schemes, which combine the creation of the conventional optical
lattice and Raman lattice with topological stability, can provide minimal
methods with high experimental feasibility to realize 1D to 3D SO couplings.
The optical Raman lattices exhibit novel intrinsic symmetries, which enable the
natural realization of topological phases belonging to different symmetry
classes, with the topology being detectable through minimal measurement
strategies. We introduce how the non-Abelian Majorana modes emerge in the SO
coupled superfluid phases which can be topologically nontrivial or trivial, for
which a few fundamental theorems are presented and discussed. The experimental
schemes for achieving non-Abelian superfluid phases are given. Finally, we
point out the future important issues in this rapidly growing research field.

released by fast advection close to apastron. To assess whether this could lead
to a maximum of the non-thermal emission before apastron, we derive simple
prescriptions for the non-thermal energy content, the radiation efficiency, and
the impact of energy losses on non-thermal particles, in the simulated
hydrodynamical flow. These prescriptions are used to estimate the non-thermal
emission in radio, X-rays, GeV, and TeV, from the shocked pulsar wind in a
binary system simulated using a simplified 3-dimensional scheme for several
orbital cycles. Lightcurves at different wavelengths are derived, together with
synthetic radio images for different orbital phases. The dominant peak in the
computed lightcurves is broad and appears close to, but before, apastron. This
peak is followed by a quasi-plateau shape, and a minor peak only in gamma rays
right after periastron. The radio maps show ejection of radio blobs before
apastron in the periastron-apastron direction. The results show that a scenario
with a highly eccentric high-mass binary hosting a young pulsar can explain the

is the key paradigm for training supervised machine learning models. Our
method---SAGD---is based on a probabilistic interpolation of SAGA and gradient
descent (GD). In particular, in each iteration we take a gradient step with
probability $q$ and a SAGA step with probability $1-q$. We show that,
surprisingly, the total expected complexity of the method (which is obtained by
multiplying the number of iterations by the expected number of gradients
computed in each iteration) is minimized for a non-trivial probability $q$. For
example, for a well conditioned problem the choice $q=1/(n-1)^2$, where $n$ is
the number of data samples, gives a method with an overall complexity which is
better than both the complexity of GD and SAGA. We further generalize the
results to a probabilistic interpolation of SAGA and minibatch SAGA, which
allows us to compute both the optimal probability and the optimal minibatch
size. While the theoretical improvement may not be large, the practical
improvement is robustly present across all synthetic and real data we tested
for, and can be substantial. Our theoretical results suggest that for this
optimal minibatch size our method achieves linear speedup in minibatch size,
which is of key practical importance as minibatch implementations are used to
train machine learning models in practice. Moreover, empirical evidence suggest
that a linear speedup in minibatch size can be attained with a parallel
implementation.

overcomes the physical space-bandwidth product (SBP) limit of a conventional
microscope by applying angular diversity illuminations. However, to date, the
effective imaging numerical aperture (NA) achievable with a commercial LED
board is still limited to the range of 0.3 to 0.7 with a 4X0.1 NA objective due
to the constraint of planar geometry with weak illumination brightness and
attenuated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Thus the highest achievable half-pitch
resolution is usually constrained between 500 to 1000 nm, which cannot fulfill
some needs of high-resolution biomedical imaging applications. Although it is
possible to improve the resolution by using a higher magnification objective
with larger NA instead of enlarging the illumination NA, the SBP is suppressed
to some extent, making the FP technique less appealing, since the reduction of
field-of-view (FOV) is much larger than the improvement of resolution in this
FP platform. Herein, in this paper, we initially present a subwavelength
resolution Fourier ptychography (SRFP) platform with a hemispherical digital
condenser to provide high-angle programmable plane-wave illuminations of
0.95NA, attaining a 4X0.1 NA objective with the final effective imaging

465 nm across a wide FOV of 14.60 mm2, corresponding to an SBP of 245

These singular contact structures are determined by the kernel of non-smooth

and study the induced structure on the critical hypersurface. The topology of
manifolds endowed with such singular contact forms are related to smooth
contact structures via desingularization. The problem of existence of
$b^m$-contact structures on a given manifold is also tackled in this paper. We
prove that a connected component of a convex hypersurface of a contact manifold
can be realized as a connected component of the critical set of a $b^m$-contact

hypersurface $Z$, this yields the existence of a $b^{2k}$-contact structure on

drawback: real-time simulations require {\em noncorrelated} states as initial
states. Consequently, initial correlations must be built up through an
adiabatic switching of the interaction before turning on any external field, a
procedure that can be numerically highly expensive. In this work, we extend the
NEGF--GKBA to allow for {\em correlated} states as initial states. Our scheme
makes it possible to efficiently separate the calculation of the initial state
from the real-time simulation, thus paving the way for enlarging the class of

general notion of quantum group.
  Recently, the so-called Belavin-Drinfeld cohomologies (twisted and untwisted)
have been introduced in the literature to study and classify certain families
of quantum groups and Lie bialgebras. Later, the last two authors interpreted
non-twisted Belavin-Drinfeld cohomologies in terms of non-abelian Galois
cohomology $H^1(\mathbb{F}, \mathbf{H})$ for a suitable algebraic
$\mathbb{F}$-group $\mathbf{H}$. Here $\mathbb{F}$ is an arbitrary field of

spacetime, it is yet to be established whether holography is a generic feature
of quantum gravity, or a peculiar property of these models. The goal of the
present work is to present a model of holographic reconstruction in the
framework of perturbative quantum gravity in flat spacetime. Specifically, we
consider a state in the single-particle sector of a quantum field theory and
give a method to completely reconstruct the quantum state from measurement of
the metric at spatial infinity. Our argument uses a relativistic generalization
of the quantum-mechanical Wigner function, and gives an explicit mechanism by
which the gravitational constraints encode quantum information holographically
on the boundary. Moreover, it suggests how information about more general
states might be recovered from soft charges at null infinity, with applications
to the black hole information loss paradox.

long-standing challenge for computational semantics. Logic-based models analyse
entailment in terms of possible worlds (interpretations, or situations) where a
premise P entails a hypothesis H iff in all worlds where P is true, H is also
true. Statistical models view this relationship probabilistically, addressing
it in terms of whether a human would likely infer H from P. In this paper, we
wish to bridge these two perspectives, by arguing for a visually-grounded
version of the Textual Entailment task. Specifically, we ask whether models can
perform better if, in addition to P and H, there is also an image
(corresponding to the relevant ""world"" or ""situation""). We use a multimodal
version of the SNLI dataset (Bowman et al., 2015) and we compare ""blind"" and

properties depend sensitively on temperature, so the calculations must account
for thermally induced magnetic disorder. Second, the most widely-used permanent
magnets are based on rare-earth elements, whose highly localized 4$f$ electrons
are poorly described by standard electronic structure methods. Here, we take
two established theories, the disordered local moment picture of thermally
induced magnetic disorder and self-interaction-corrected density functional
theory, and devise a computational framework to overcome these challenges.
Using the new approach, we calculate magnetic moments and Curie temperatures of
the rare-earth cobalt (RECo$_5$) family for RE=Y--Lu. The calculations
correctly reproduce the experimentally measured trends across the series and
confirm that, apart from the hypothetical compound EuCo$_5$, SmCo$_5$ has the
strongest magnetic properties at high temperature. An order-parameter analysis
demonstrates that varying the RE has a surprisingly strong effect on the Co--Co
magnetic interactions determining the Curie temperature, even when the lattice
parameters are kept fixed. We propose the origin of this behavior is a small
contribution to the density from $f$-character electrons located close to the
Fermi level.

vector dark matter model. The vector dark matter in the hidden sector does not
directly couple to the visible sector, but instead annihilates into the hidden
Higgs bosons which decay through a small coupling into the CP-odd Higgs bosons.
In this model, the Galactic center gamma-ray excess is mainly due to the 2-step
cascade annihilation with $\tau$'s in the final state. The obtained mass of the
CP-odd Higgs $A$ in the Galactic center excess fit can explain the muon $g-2$
anomaly at the 2$\sigma$ level without violating the stringent constraints from
the lepton universality and $\tau$ decays. We show three different freeze-out
types of the dark matter relic, called (i) the conventional WIMP dark matter,
(ii) the unconventional WIMP dark matter and (iii) the cannibally co-decaying
dark matter, depending on the magnitudes of the mixing angles between the
hidden Higgs and visible two-Higgs doublets. The dark matter in the hidden
sector is secluded from detections in the direct searches or colliders, while
the dark matter annihilation signals are not suppressed in a general hidden

more than four derivatives can have remarkable regularity properties if
compared to their fourth-order counterparts. To this end, we derive the
expressions for the metric potentials associated to a pointlike mass in a
general higher-order gravity model in the Newtonian limit. It is shown that any
polynomial model with at least six derivatives in both spin-2 and spin-0
sectors has regular curvature invariants. We also discuss the dynamical problem
of the collapse of a small mass, considered as a spherical superposition of
nonspinning gyratons. Similarly to the static case, for models with more than
four derivatives the Kretschmann invariant is regular during the collapse of a
thick null shell. We also verify the existence of the mass gap for the
formation of mini black holes even if complex and/or degenerate poles are
allowed, generalizing previous considerations on the subject and covering the
case of Lee-Wick gravity. These interesting regularity properties of sixth- and
higher-derivative models at the linear level reinforce the question of whether
there can be nonsingular black holes in the full nonlinear model.

the $T$-matrix formalism to compute charm-quark transport coefficients for

elliptic flow comparable to the results from the internal energy at low

off stronger with increasing 3-momentum. The weakly coupled $T$-matrix

determine the spatial distribution of the defects optimizing the critical
current and find that it is in general non-uniform and asymmetric: the barrier
at the vortex-exit edge influence the critical current much stronger than the

energetically compete with the large kinetic energy at and below the Fermi
surface (FS). Recently it was experimentally observed that the FS is deformed
from a sphere to an ellipsoid due to the presence of the anisotropic and
long-range dipole-dipole interaction. Moreover, it was suggested that, when the
dipoles are rotated by means of an external field, the FS follows their
rotation, thereby keeping the major axis of the momentum-space ellipsoid
parallel to the dipoles. Here we generalise a previous Hartree-Fock mean-field
theory to systems confined in an elongated triaxial trap with an arbitrary
orientation of the dipoles relative to the trap. With this we study for the
first time the effects of the dipoles' arbitrary orientation on the
ground-state properties of the system. Furthermore, taking into account the
geometry of the system, we show how the ellipsoidal FS deformation can be
reconstructed, assuming ballistic expansion, from the experimentally measurable
real-space aspect ratio after a free expansion. We compare our theoretical
results with new experimental data measured with an erbium Fermi gas for
various trap parameters and dipole orientations. The observed remarkable
agreement demonstrates the ability of our model to capture the full angular
dependence of the FS deformation. Moreover, for systems with even higher dipole
moment, our theory predicts an additional unexpected effect: the FS does not
simply follow rigidly the orientation of the dipoles, but softens showing a
change in the aspect ratio depending on the dipoles' orientation relative to
the trap geometry, as well as on the trap anisotropy itself. Our theory
provides the basis for understanding and interpreting phenomena in which the
investigated physics depends on the underlying structure of the FS, such as
fermionic pairing and superfluidity.

were incorrectly identified as isolated point sources in the ROSAT All-Sky
Survey. We present a Chandra X-ray observation of our first newly discovered
low-redshift (z = 0.223) galaxy cluster with a central X-ray bright point
source, PKS1353-341. After removing the point source contribution to the
cluster core (L_nuc ~ 1.8x10^44 erg/s), we determine various properties of the
cluster. The presence of a relaxed X-ray morphology, a central temperature
drop, and a central cooling time around 400 Myr indicates that it is a strong
cool-core cluster. The central galaxy appears to be forming stars at the rate
of 6.2+\-3.6 Msun/yr, corresponding to ~1% of the classical cooling prediction.
The supermassive black hole in the central galaxy appear to be accreting at
~0.1% of the Eddington rate with a total power output of ~5x10^45 erg/s, split
nearly equally between radiative and mechanical power. We see weak evidence of
localized excess entropy at a radius of 200 kpc which, if true, could imply a
recent (~180 Myr) energetic outburst in the core that has risen buoyantly to a
larger radius. Comparing the cluster's bulk properties with those of other
known clusters (e.g., the total mass M_500 is 6.9(+4.3)(-2.6)x10^14 Msun, and
the bolometric X-ray luminosity L_X is 7x10^44 erg/s), we show that this
cluster, which is massive enough that it was detected (but not confirmed) by
the Planck survey, is also sufficiently luminous that it would have been
identified as a cluster in the ROSAT All-sky Survey if it did not have such a
bright central point source. This discovery demonstrates the potential of the
CHiPS survey to find massive nearby clusters with extreme central properties
that may have been missed or misidentified by previous surveys.

and numerical simulations in the linear and non-linear regimes. For subsonic or
transonic streams with respect to the halo sound speed, the instability in 3D
is qualitatively similar to 2D, but progresses at a faster pace. For supersonic
streams, the instability grows much faster in 3D and can be qualitatively
different due to azimuthal modes, which introduce a strong dependence on the
initial width of the stream-background interface. Using analytic toy models and
approximations supported by high-resolution simulations, we apply our idealized
hydrodynamical analysis to the astrophysical scenario. The upper limit for the
radius of a stream that disintegrates prior to reaching the central galaxy is
~70% larger than the 2D estimate; it is in the range (0.5-5)% of the halo
virial radius, decreasing with increasing stream density and velocity. Stream
disruption generates a turbulent mixing zone around the stream with velocities
at the level of ~20% of the initial stream velocity. KHI can cause significant
stream deceleration and energy dissipation in 3d, contrary to 2D estimates. For
typical streams, up to (10-50)% of the gravitational energy gained by inflow
down the dark-matter halo potential can be dissipated, capable of powering
Lyman-alpha blobs if most of it is dissipated into radiation.

However, the detailed heating mechanism remains uncertain. One promising
heating scenario invokes the dissipation of Alfv\'en waves that are generated
by streaming cosmic rays (CRs). In order to study this idea, we use
three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamical simulations with the AREPO code that
follow the evolution of jet-inflated bubbles that are filled with CRs in a
turbulent cluster atmosphere. We find that a single injection event produces
the CR distribution and heating rate required for a successful CR heating
model. As a bubble rises buoyantly, cluster magnetic fields drape around the
leading interface and are amplified to strengths that balance the ram pressure.
Together with helical magnetic fields in the bubble, this initially confines
the CRs and suppresses the formation of interface instabilities. But as the
bubble continues to rise, bubble-scale eddies significantly amplify radial
magnetic filaments in its wake and enable CR transport from the bubble to the
cooling intracluster medium. By varying the jet parameters, we obtain a rich
and diverse set of jet and bubble morphologies ranging from Fanaroff-Riley type
I-like (FRI) to FRII-like jets. We identify jet energy as the leading order
parameter (keeping the ambient density profiles fixed), whereas jet luminosity
is primarily responsible for setting the Mach numbers of shocks around
FRII-like sources. Our simulations also produce FRI-like jets that inflate
bubbles without detectable shocks and show morphologies consistent with cluster
observations.

with their terrestrial and laboratory counterparts-they can be traced from
their origin to distances exceeding their injection radius by up to a billion
times. However, some less energetic jets get disrupted and lose their coherence
on the scale of their host galaxy. Quite remarkably, on the same scale, these
jets are expected to become confined by the thermal pressure of the
intra-galactic gas. Motivated by these observations, we have started a
systematic study of active galactic nuclei jets undergoing reconfinement via
computer simulations. Here, we show that in the case of unmagnetized
relativistic jets, the reconfinement is accompanied by the development of an
instability and transition to a turbulent state. During their initial growth,
the perturbations have a highly organized streamwise-oriented structure,
indicating that it is not the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, the instability
which has been the main focus of the jet stability studies so far. Instead, it
is closely related to the centrifugal instability. This instability is likely
to be behind the division of active galactic nuclei jets into two morphological
types in the Fanaroff-Riley classification.

tend to reduce the net radiation force and extend its range; however, there is
significant variance among realizations. Within our models, force integrals
correlate with the emergent spectral energy distribution, given a specified set

neutron star (NS) mergers. However, a barrier to direct confirmation of the
magnetar hypothesis is the challenge of directly observing non-thermal emission
from the central engine at early times (when it is most powerful and thus
detectable) due to the dense surrounding ejecta. We present CLOUDY calculations
of the time-dependent evolution of the temperature and ionization structure of
expanding supernova or merger ejecta due to photo-ionization by a magnetar
engine, in order to study the escape of X-rays (absorbed by neutral gas) and
radio waves (absorbed by ionized gas), as well as to assess the evolution of
the local dispersion measure due to photo-ionization. We find that ionization
breakout does not occur if the engine's ionizing luminosity decays rapidly, and
that X-rays typically escape the oxygen-rich ejecta of SLSNe only on $\sim 100
\, {\rm yr}$ timescales, consistent with current X-ray non-detections. We apply
these results to constrain engine-driven models for the binary NS merger
GW170817 and the luminous transient ASASSN-15lh. In terms of radio transparency
and dispersion measure constraints, the repeating FRB 121102 is consistent with
originating from a young, $\gtrsim 30-100 \, {\rm yr}$, magnetar similar to
those inferred to power SLSNe. We further show that its high rotation measure
can be produced within the same nebula that is proposed to power the quiescent

previous work suggesting that at least some FRBs may be produced by young

are regions of enhanced Ly$\alpha$ forest transmission near the quasar
resulting from its own ionizing radiation. The presence of such young objects
poses significant challenges to models of SMBH formation, which already
struggle to explain the existence of SMBHs at such early cosmic epochs. We
conduct the first comprehensive spectroscopic study of the youngest quasar
known, $\rm SDSS\,J1335+3533$ at $z=5.9012$, whose lifetime is $t_{\rm Q}<10^4$
yr ($95\%$ confidence). A careful search of our deep optical and near-infrared

that its small proximity zone results from an associated absorption system

black hole mass $M_{\rm BH}=(4.09\pm0.58)\times 10^9 M_{\odot}$, implying an
Eddington ratio of $0.30\pm0.04$ -- comparable to other co-eval quasars. We
similarly find that the relationship between its black hole mass and dynamical
mass are consistent with other $z\sim6$ quasars. The only possible anomaly
associated with youth are its weak emission lines, but larger samples are
needed to shed light on a potential causal connection. We discuss the
implications of short lifetimes for various SMBH growth scenarios, and argue
that future observations of young quasars with JWST could distinguish between

stellar regions is occasional giant-amplitude outbursts of multiwavelength
radiation from tidal disruption and subsequent accretion of stars that make a
close approach to the black holes. Previous strong tidal disruption event (TDE)
candidates were all associated with the centers of largely isolated galaxies.
Here we report the discovery of a luminous X-ray outburst from a massive star
cluster at a projected distance of 12.5 kpc from the center of a large
lenticular galaxy. The luminosity peaked at ~10^{43} erg/s and decayed
systematically over 10 years, approximately following a trend that supports the
identification of the event as a TDE. The X-ray spectra were all very soft,
with emission confined to be <3.0 keV, and could be described with a standard
thermal disk. The disk cooled significantly as the luminosity decreased, a key
thermal-state signature often observed in accreting stellar-mass black holes.
This thermal-state signature, coupled with very high luminosities, ultrasoft
X-ray spectra and the characteristic power-law evolution of the light curve,
provides strong evidence that the source contains an intermediate-mass black
hole (IMBH) with a mass of a few ten thousand solar mass. This event
demonstrates that one of the most effective means to detect IMBHs is through
X-ray flares from TDEs in star clusters.

flattening a turbulent streamwise velocity profile in pipe flow destabilises
the turbulence so that the flow relaminarises. We show that a similar
phenomenon exists for laminar pipe flow profiles in the sense that the
nonlinear stability of the laminar state is enhanced as the profile becomes
more flattened. Significant drag reduction is also observed for the turbulent
flow when triggered by sufficiently large disturbances. The flattening is
produced by an artificial body force designed to mimick a baffle used in the
experiments of Kuehnen et al. (2018) and the nonlinear stability measured by
the size of the energy of the initial perturbations needed to trigger
transition. In order to make the latter computation more efficient, we examine
how indicative the minimal seed for transition is in measuring transition
thresholds. We first show that the minimal seed is relatively robust to base
profile changes and spectral filtering. We then compare the (unforced)
transition behaviour of the minimal seed with several forms of randomised
initial conditions in the range of Reynolds numbers Re=2400 to 10000 and find
that the energy of the minimal seed after the Orr and oblique phases of its
evolution is close to that of a localised random disturbance. In this sense,
the minimal seed at the end of the oblique phase can be regarded as a good
proxy for typical disturbances (here taken to be the localised random ones) and
is thus used as initial condition in the simulations with the body force. The
enhanced nonlinear stability and drag reduction predicted in the present study
are an encouraging first step in modelling the experiments of Kuehnen et al.
and should motivate future developments to fully exploit the benefits of this
promising direction for flow control.

efforts have either adopted spherical harmonics, or various ad hoc map
parameterizations, none of which produce orthogonal lightcurves. We use
principal component analysis to construct orthogonal ""eigencurves,"" which we
then use to fit published 8 micron observations of the hot Jupiter HD 189733b.
This approach has a few advantages over previously used techniques: 1) the
lightcurves can be pre-computed, accelerating the fitting process, 2) the
eigencurves are orthogonal to each other, reducing parameter correlations, and
3) the eigencurves are model-independent and are ranked in order of
sensitivity. One notable result of our analysis is that eclipse-only mapping of
HD 189733b is far more sensitive to the central concentration of dayside flux
than to the eastward offset of that hotspot. Mapping can, in principle, suffer
from degeneracies between spatial patterns and orbital parameters. Previous
mapping efforts using these data have either assumed a circular orbit and
precise inclination, or have been pessimistic about the prospects of eclipse
mapping in the face of uncertain orbital parameters. We show that for HD
189733b the combined photometry and radial velocity are sufficiently precise to
retire this concern. Lastly, we present the first map of brightness
temperature, and we quantify the amplitude and longitude offset of the dayside
hotspot.

  Procaccia","Computation-Aware Data Aggregation","Changed the introduction and title; this is the ITCS camera-ready
  version",,,,"cs.DS cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Data aggregation is a fundamental primitive in distributed computing wherein
a network computes a function of every nodes' input. However, while compute
time is non-negligible in modern systems, standard models of distributed
computing do not take compute time into account. Rather, most distributed
models of computation only explicitly consider communication time.
  In this paper, we introduce a model of distributed computation that considers
\emph{both} computation and communication so as to give a theoretical treatment
of data aggregation. We study both the structure of and how to compute the
fastest data aggregation schedule in this model. As our first result, we give a
polynomial-time algorithm that computes the optimal schedule when the input
network is a complete graph. Moreover, since one may want to aggregate data
over a pre-existing network, we also study data aggregation scheduling on
arbitrary graphs. We demonstrate that this problem on arbitrary graphs is hard
to approximate within a multiplicative $1.5$ factor. Finally, we give an
$O(\log n \cdot \log \frac{\mathrm{OPT}}{t_m})$-approximation algorithm for
this problem on arbitrary graphs, where $n$ is the number of nodes and
$\mathrm{OPT}$ is the length of the optimal schedule.

general Hamiltonians. Incorporating a recently proposed technique, we employ
the low depth swap test to energetically penalise the ground state, and
transform excited states into ground states of modified Hamiltonians. We use
variational imaginary time evolution as a subroutine, which deterministically
propagates towards the target eigenstate. We discuss how symmetry measurements
can mitigate errors in the swap test step. We numerically test our algorithm on

the electronic structure of the Lithium Hydride molecule. As our algorithm uses

an idealized model in which the gas is polytropic. To find interior solutions
to the Einstein equations of General Relativity in this setting we derive a

Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation to derive formulas for the isentropic index

the maximum amplitude along the trajectory of a paraxial accelerating beam.
This is accomplished by carefully engineering both the amplitude and the phase
of the beam on the input plane. Furthermore, we show that the width of an
accelerating beam is related only on the curvature of the trajectory.
Therefore, we are able to produce beams with predefined beam widths and
amplitudes. These results are useful in applications where precise beam control
is important. In addition we consider radially symmetric abruptly autofocusing
beams. We identify the important parameters that affect the focal
characteristics. Consequently, we can design autofocusing beams with optimized
parameters (such as sharper focus and higher intensity contrast). In all our
calculations the resulting formulas are presented in an elegant and practical
form in direct connection with the geometric properties of the trajectory.
Finally we discuss methods that can be utilized to experimentally realize such

learned based on image features. To this end, we introduce aperture features
that extract gray values by sampling the 3D volume within the cone centered
around the associated vertex and its normal vector. Our approach is also
capable of estimating a hierarchical pyramid of non rigid deformations for
multi-resolution meshes. In the application phase, we use a marginal approach
to gradually estimate affine as well as non-rigid transformations. We performed
extensive evaluations to highlight the robust performance of our approach on a
variety of challenge data as well as clinical data. Additionally, our method
has a run time ranging from 0.3 to 2.7 seconds to segment each organ. In
addition, we show that the proposed method can be applied to different organs,
X-ray based modalities, and scanning protocols without the need of transfer
learning. As we learn actions, even unseen reference meshes can be processed as
demonstrated in an example with the Visible Human. From this we conclude that
our method is robust, and we believe that our method can be successfully
applied to many more applications, in particular, in the interventional imaging

concept in multiple fields of physics. It replaces the detailed shape of a
potential by a delta-function operator multiplied by a parameter giving the
strength of the potential. For Cartesian dimensions $d>1$, a regularization
operator is necessary to remove singularities in the wave function. In this
study, we develop a Fermi pseudopotential generalized to $d$ dimensions
(including non-integer) and to non-zero wavenumber, $k$. Our approach has the
advantage of circumventing singularities that occur in the wave function at
certain integer values of $d$ while being valid arbitrarily close to integer
$d$. In the limit of integer dimension, we show that our generalized
pseudopotential is equivalent to previously derived $s$-wave pseudopotentials.
Our pseudopotential generalizes the operator to non-integer dimension, includes
energy ($k$) dependence, and simplifies the dimension-dependent coupling
constant expression derived from a Green's function approach. We apply this
pseudopotential to the problem of two cold atoms ($k\to0$) in a harmonic trap
and extend the energy expression to arbitrary dimension.

vectors: an influence vector that measures how influential/authoritative they
are on each topic; and a receptivity vector that measures how
receptive/susceptible they are to each topic. We show how these two node-topic

challenge requires techniques capable of measuring the local electronic
structure with high-resolution depth dependence. Here, we have used
linearly-polarized resonant X-ray reflectometry (RXR) as a means to visualize
charge transfer in oxide superlattices with atomic layer precision. From our
RXR measurements, we extract valence depth profiles of SmTiO$_3$
(SmTO)/SrTiO$_3$ (STO) heterostructures with STO quantum wells varying in
thickness from 5 SrO planes down to a single, atomically thin SrO plane. At the
polar-nonpolar SmTO/STO interface, an electrostatic discontinuity leads to
approximately half an electron per areal unit cell transferred from the
interfacial SmO layer into the neighboring STO quantum well. We observe this
charge transfer as a suppression of the t$_{2g}$ absorption peaks that
minimizes contrast with the neighboring SmTO layers at those energies and leads
to a pronounced absence of superlattice peaks in the reflectivity data. Our
results demonstrate the sensitivity of RXR to electronic reconstruction at the
atomic scale, and establish RXR as a powerful means of characterizing charge
transfer at buried oxide interfaces.

In the study, we have utilized both geometric features and appearance-based

eight anthropometric landmarks and consist of 14 distance measurements and two
area calculations. The appearance-based methods employ deep convolutional
neural networks for representation and classification. The well-known

large-scale ear dataset that has been built from the profile and
close-to-profile face images in the Multi-PIE face dataset. This way, we have
performed a domain adaptation. The updated models have been fine-tuned once
more time on the small-scale target ear dataset, which contains only around 270

appearance-based methods have been found to be superior to the methods based on

in a large variety of systems. These include the secure communication networks
of commercial enterprises, government agencies and illicit organizations, as
well as networks that suffered multiple failures, attacks or epidemics. The
properties of such networks resemble those of subcritical random networks,
which consist of finite components, whose sizes are non-extensive.
Surprisingly, such networks do not exhibit the small-world property that is
typical in supercritical random networks, where the mean distance between pairs
of nodes scales logarithmically with the network size. Unlike supercritical
networks whose structure has been studied extensively, subcritical networks
have attracted little attention. A special feature of these networks is that
the statistical and geometric properties vary between different components and
depend on their sizes and topologies. The overall statistics of the network can
be obtained by a summation over all the components with suitable weights. We
use a topological expansion to perform a systematic analysis of the degree
distribution and the distribution of shortest path lengths (DSPL) on components
of given sizes and topologies in subcritical Erdos-Renyi (ER) networks. From
this expansion we obtain an exact analytical expression for the DSPL of the
entire subcritical network, in the asymptotic limit. The DSPL, which accounts
for all the pairs of nodes that reside on the same finite component (FC), is
found to follow a geometric distribution of the form $P_{\rm
FC}(L=\ell|L<\infty)=(1-c)c^{\ell-1}$, where $c<1$ is the mean degree. We
confirm the convergence to this asymptotic result using computer simulations.
Using the duality relations between subcritical and supercritical ER networks,
we obtain the DSPL on the non-giant components above the percolation
transition.

sources are called `mini-halos'. In order to understand their origin, which is
still unclear, joint radio and X-ray statistical studies of large cluster
samples are necessary to investigate the radio mini-halo properties and their
connection with the cluster thermodynamics. We here extend our previous
explorative study and investigate the perspectives offered by surveys in the
radio continuum with LOFAR and SKA, in particular examining the effect of the
intra-cluster magnetic field in the mini-halo region for the first time. By
considering the minimum flux detectable in radio surveys and exploiting the
$P_{radio}-L_X$ correlation observed for known mini-halos, we estimate the
detection limits achievable by future radio observational follow-up of X-ray
cluster samples, such as HIFLUGCS and eROSITA. This allows us to estimate the
maximum number of radio mini-halos that can potentially be discovered in future
surveys as a function of redshift and magnetic field strength. We show that
future radio surveys with LOFAR and SKA1 (at 140 MHz and 1.4 GHz) have the
potential to discover ~1,000-10,000 radio mini-halo candidates up to redshift
z=1. We further note that future SKA1 radio surveys at redshift z>0.6 will
allow us to distinguish between different magnetic fields in the mini-halo
region, because higher magnetic fields are expected to produce more powerful
mini-halos, thus implying a larger number of mini-halo detected at high
redshift. For example, the non-detection with SKA1 of mini-halos at z>0.6 will
suggest a low magnetic field (B < few $\mu$G). The synergy of these radio
surveys with future X-ray observations and theoretical studies is essential in
establishing the radio mini-halo physical nature. [abridged]

physical processes. Examples range from autonomous cars to implantable medical
devices, which are highly safety critical. Hybrid Automata (HA) based formal
approach is gaining momentum for the specification and validation of CPS. HA
combines the model of the plant along with its discrete controller resulting in
a piece-wise continuous system with discontinuities. Accurate detection of
these discontinuities, using appropriate level crossing detectors, is a key
challenge to simulation of CPS based on HA. Existing techniques employ time
discrete numerical integration with bracketing for level crossing detection.
These techniques involve back-tracking and are highly non-deterministic and
hence error prone. As level crossings happen based on the values of continuous
variables, Quantized State System (QSS)- integration may be more suitable.
Existing QSS integrators, based on fixed quanta, are also unsuitable for
simulating HAs. This is since the quantum selected is not dependent on the HA
guard conditions, which are the main cause of discontinuities. Considering
this, we propose a new dynamic quanta based formal model called Quantized State
Hybrid Automata (QSHA). The developed formal model and the associated
simulation framework guarantees that (1) all level crossings are accurately
detected and (2) the time of the level crossing is also accurate within
floating point error bounds. Interestingly, benchmarking results reveal that
the proposed simulation technique takes 720, 1.33 and 4.41 times fewer
simulation steps compared to standard Quantized State System (QSS)-1,
Runge-Kutta (RK)-45, and Differential Algebraic System Solver (DASSL)

demonstrating that networks which generalize converge to more similar

investigate multiple signal scenarios utilizing various antenna geometries,

techniques to the area of coding. We use tiny codes, i.e. sliding window by

protocols, by building on the baseline scheme, i.e. uncoded ARQ, developed by
Ausavapattanakun and Nosratinia: (i) Hybrid ARQ with soft combining at the
receiver; (ii) cumulative feedback-based ARQ without rate adaptation; and (iii)
Coded ARQ with rate adaptation based on the cumulative feedback. Contrasting
the performance of these protocols with uncoded ARQ, we demonstrate that HARQ
performs only slightly better, cumulative feedback-based ARQ does not provide
significant throughput while it has better average delay, and Coded ARQ can
provide gains up to about 40% in terms of throughput. Coded ARQ also provides
delay guarantees, and is robust to various challenges such as imperfect and
delayed feedback, burst erasures, and round-trip time fluctuations. This

The Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden (HGO) model was adopted for modelling the mechanical
behavior of the aortic bulk material. The simulation results using CZM on the
aortic media delamination were also compared with the results on mouse plaque

the triangular and exponential-linear CZMs match well with the experimental

(CGM) of emission line galaxies (ELGs) traced by metal absorption lines. Using
about 200,000 ELGs from SDSS-IV eBOSS and half a million background quasars
from SDSS, we measure the median absorption strength of MgII and FeII lines in
quasar spectra for impact parameters ranging from 10 kpc to 1 Mpc. For
comparison we measure the same quantity around luminous red galaxies (LRGs). On
scales greater than 100 kpc both ELGs and LRGs exhibit similar absorption
profiles. However, metal absorption is 5-10 times stronger around ELGs on
smaller scales. The metal absorption strength is anisotropic, with an excess
along the minor-axis of the galaxies, indicating an outflow origin of the
absorbing gas. The ratio between the velocity dispersion of the cool CGM and
that of its host dark matter halo is about one for ELGs but about half for
LRGs. These results show that the dichotomy of galaxy types is reflected in
both the density distribution and kinematics of the CGM traced by metal
absorption lines. Our results provide strong evidence that the CGM of ELGs is
enriched by gas outflows generated by star formation.

k-nearest neighbor classifiers and study other empirical properties. We show
that the ratio of image pixel distribution similarity across classes to within

When we apply the linear support vector machine for image classification we see
that the accuracy is higher than if we were to train just the final layer of
VGG16, ResNet18, and DenseNet40 with random weights. In the same setting we
compare it to an unsupervised feature learning method and find our accuracy to

positive. Afterwards, the action of the immune system, as well as the

of numerical simulations and the classical linear stability analysis. The role
of adoptive cellular immunotherapy is also addressed. Our overall conclusion is
that chemoimmunotherapeutic protocols can be effective in treating chronic

source enhancement. Through a training step by using a large amount of data,
DNN estimates a mapping between mixed signals and clean signals. At this time,
we use an objective function that numerically expresses the quality of a
mapping by DNN. In the conventional methods, L1 norm, L2 norm, and
Itakura-Saito divergence are often used as objective functions. Recently, an
objective function based on short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) has
also been proposed. However, these functions only indicate similarity between
the clean signal and the estimated signal by DNN. In other words, they do not
show the quality of noise reduction or source enhancement. Motivated by the
fact, this paper adopts signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) as the objective
function. Since SDR virtually shows signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), maximizing SDR
solves the above problem. The experimental results revealed that the proposed

challenges: 1) inherent low intra-class and high inter-class spectral
similarities, 2) mismatching resolution of available bands, and 3) the need to
regularize noisy classification maps. Conventional methods have addressed these
challenges by adopting separate stages of image fusion, feature extraction, and
post-classification map regularization. These processing stages, however, are
not jointly optimizing the classification task at hand. In this study, we
propose a single-stage framework embedding the processing stages in a recurrent
multiresolution convolutional network trained in an end-to-end manner. The
feedforward version of the network, called FuseNet, aims to match the
resolution of the panchromatic and multispectral bands in a VHR image using
convolutional layers with corresponding downsampling and upsampling operations.
Contextual label information is incorporated into FuseNet by means of a
recurrent version called ReuseNet. We compared FuseNet and ReuseNet against the
use of separate processing steps for both image fusion, e.g. pansharpening and
resampling through interpolation, and map regularization such as conditional
random fields. We carried out our experiments on a land cover classification

and maps it into a specialized accelerator, which is designed using
non-volatile memory blocks that model four fundamental DNN operations, i.e.,
multiplication, addition, activation functions, and pooling. The framework
extracts representative operands of a DNN model, e.g., weights and input
values, using clustering methods to optimize the model for in-memory
processing. Then, it maps the extracted operands and their precomputed results
into the accelerator memory blocks. At runtime, the accelerator identifies
computation results based on efficient in-memory search capability which also
provides tunability of approximation to further improve computation efficiency.
Our evaluation shows that RAPIDNN achieves 68.4x, 49.5x energy efficiency

critical for the accurate assessment of differences between images from
different cells. The images of the brushes on healthy model cells are found to
be more textured than those of brushes on model cancerous cells, as indicated
by the larger lacunarity of the former. These findings are helpful to
distinguish monofractal behavior from multifractality, which has been found to
be useful to discriminate between immortal, cancerous and normal cells in
recent experiments.

learning problems that utilize images and label information to learn the binary
hash codes. However, large-scale labeled image data is expensive to obtain,
thus imposing a restriction on the usage of such algorithms. On the other hand,
unlabelled image data is abundant due to the existence of many Web image
repositories. Such Web images may often come with images tags that contain
useful information, although raw tags, in general, do not readily lead to
semantic labels. Motivated by this scenario, we formulate the problem of
semantic image hashing as a weakly-supervised learning problem. We utilize the
information contained in the user-generated tags associated with the images to
learn the hash codes. More specifically, we extract the word2vec semantic
embeddings of the tags and use the information contained in them for
constraining the learning. Accordingly, we name our model Weakly Supervised
Deep Hashing using Tag Embeddings (WDHT). WDHT is tested for the task of
semantic image retrieval and is compared against several state-of-art models.
Results show that our approach sets a new state-of-art in the area of weekly

algorithms to generalize across different testing conditions. The problem has
been formalized as a covariate shift among the probability distributions

approaches have considered the single source-single target scenario, it is
plausible to have multiple sources and require adaptation to any possible

invariant representations from source data, we design a deep network with
multiple domain-specific classifiers, each associated to a source domain. At
test time we estimate the probabilities that a target sample belongs to each

To further improve the generalization ability of our model, we also introduced
a domain agnostic component supporting the final classifier. Experiments on two

  The simulation chain is arranged with the help of intuitive configuration

Detailed electric field maps imported from TCAD simulations can be used to

  This paper provides an overview of the framework and a selection of different

that this phase can be realized even in models when antiferromagnetic
interaction along one of the three directions. This model also supports three
different ferromagnetic (FM) phases, denoted as $x$-FM, $y$-FM and $z$-FM,

generically by a non-singular quantum bounce due to purely quantum geometric
effects. The evolution can be divided into two different classes, one is
dominated initially (at the quantum bounce) by the kinetic energy of the scalar
field, and one is not. In both cases, we identify numerically the physically
viable initial conditions that lead to not only a slow-roll inflationary phase,
but also enough $e$-folds to be consistent with observations, and find that the
output of such a viable slow-roll inflationary phase is generic. In addition,
we also show that in the case when the evolution of the universe is dominated
initially by the kinetic energy of the scalar field (except for a very small
set in the phase space), the evolution before reheating is aways divided into
three different phases: {\em bouncing, transition and slow-roll inflation}.
This universal feature does not depend on the initial conditions of the system

user feedback is used to improve the quality of displayed lists. Learning to
rank has traditionally been studied in two settings. In the offline setting,
rankers are typically learned from relevance labels created by judges. This
approach has generally become standard in industrial applications of ranking,
such as search. However, this approach lacks exploration and thus is limited by
the information content of the offline training data. In the online setting, an
algorithm can experiment with lists and learn from feedback on them in a
sequential fashion. Bandit algorithms are well-suited for this setting but they
tend to learn user preferences from scratch, which results in a high initial
cost of exploration. This poses an additional challenge of safe exploration in
ranked lists. We propose BubbleRank, a bandit algorithm for safe re-ranking
that combines the strengths of both the offline and online settings. The
algorithm starts with an initial base list and improves it online by gradually
exchanging higher-ranked less attractive items for lower-ranked more attractive
items. We prove an upper bound on the n-step regret of BubbleRank that degrades
gracefully with the quality of the initial base list. Our theoretical findings

generation and demand power are stochastic and the power reserve is provided by
conventional generation, against the case where the operation of traditionally
stochastic resources is dispatched according to pre-established dispatch plans
thanks to controlling local flexibility. Simulations reproduce the
post-contingency dynamic behavior of the grid due to outages of generators. The

reactions in the buildup of complex organic molecules in the dense interstellar

while abstraction reactions recreate radicals that may undergo radical-radical
recombination reactions. Previous experimental work has indicated that double
and triple C--C bonds are easily hydrogenated, but aldehyde -C=O bonds are not.
Here, we investigate a total of 29 reactions of the hydrogen atom with
propynal, propargyl alcohol, propenal, allyl alcohol, and propanal by means of
quantum chemical methods to quantify the reaction rate constants involved.
  First of all, our results are in good agreement with and can explain the
observed experimental findings. The hydrogen addition to the aldehyde group,
either on the C or O side, is indeed slow for all molecules considered.
Abstraction of the H atom of the aldehyde group, on the other hand, is among
the faster reactions. Furthermore, hydrogen addition to C--C double bonds is
generally faster than to triple bonds. In both cases, addition on the terminal
carbon atom that is not connected to other functional groups is easiest.
Finally, we wish to stress that it is not possible to predict rate constants
based solely on the type of reaction: the specific functional groups attached
to a backbone play a crucial role and can lead to a spread of several orders of
magnitude in the rate constant.

see that the surface degrees of freedom originate from horizon area and it is
clear that spacetime torsion never contributes to the surface degrees of
freedom and hence neither to the black hole entropy. We further show that the
gravitational Hamiltonian in presence of torsion does not inherit any torsion

attention due to the challenge that offers to find an algorithm with a robust
convergence with respect to the spline degree. Here, we analyze the application
of geometric multigrid methods to this type of discretizations, and we propose
a multigrid approach based on overlapping multiplicative Schwarz methods as
smoothers. The size of the blocks considered within these relaxation procedures
is adapted to the spline degree. A simple multigrid V-cycle with only one step
of pre-smoothing results to be a very efficient algorithm, whose convergence is
independent on the spline degree and the spatial discretization parameter.
Local Fourier analysis is shown to be very useful for the understanding of the
problems encountered in the design of a robust multigrid method for IGA, and it
is performed to support the good convergence properties of the proposed solver.
In fact, an analysis for any spline degree and an arbitrary size of the blocks
within the Schwarz smoother is presented for the one-dimensional case. The
efficiency of the solver is also demonstrated through several numerical
experiments, including a two-dimensional problem on a nontrivial computational
domain.

formulate the market maker's optimization problem using Markov Decision

the role of one-period reward in the MDP model. Based on this characterization,
we provide explicit criteria for assessing the profitability of market making
when there is latency. Under our model, we show that a market maker can earn a
positive expected profit if there are sufficient uninformed market orders
hitting the market maker's limit orders compared with the rate of price jumps,
and the trading horizon is sufficiently long. In addition, our theoretical and

latency impacts negatively the performance of market makers.

CCBPF has good stability properties in the sense that with fixed number of

with respect to the time horizon under a general (strong mixing) condition. The
CCBPF is useful not only as a theoretical tool, but also as a practical method

which depends on the atmospheric height. It separates the low-frequency
evanescent waves from the high-frequency propagating waves. We measure the
cutoff frequency of slow magnetoacoustic waves at various heights of a sunspot
umbra and compare the results with the estimations from several analytical
formulae. We analyzed the oscillations in the umbra of a sunspot belonging to
active region NOAA 12662 observed in the 10830 \AA\ spectral region with the
GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph and in the Fe I 5435 \AA\ line with the GREGOR
Fabry-P\'erot Interferometer. Both instrumets are attached to the GREGOR
telescope at the Observatorio del Teide, Tenerife, Spain. We have computed the
phase and amplification spectra between the velocity measured from different
pairs of lines that sample various heights of the solar atmosphere. The cutoff
frequency and its height variation have been estimated from the inspection of
the spectra. At the deep umbral photosphere the cutoff frequency is around 5
mHz and it increases to 6 mHz at higher photospheric layers. At the
chromosphere the cutoff is $\sim 3.1$ mHz. The comparison of the
observationally determined cutoff with the theoretically predicted values
reveals an agreement in the general trend and a reasonable match at the
chromosphere, but also significant quantitative differences at the photosphere.
Our analyses show strong evidence of the variation of the cutoff frequency with
height in a sunspot umbra, which is not fully accounted for by current

reaches $\sim 1\%$ accuracy in the majority of the $k$-range up to the Nyquist

produce mock halo and galaxy catalogs for future galaxy surveys and

energy detection allowed rapid recording of 4D (EB,k) data arrays (EB binding
energy; k final-state electron momentum) in the photon-energy range of
400-1700eV. Arrays for the d-band complex of several transition metals (Mo, W,
Re, Ir) reveal numerous spots of strong local intensity enhancement up to a
factor of 5. The enhancement is confined to small (EB,k)-regions (dk down to
0.01 A-1; dEB down to 200 meV) and is a fingerprint of valence-band
photoelectron diffraction. Regions of constructive interference in the
(EB,k)-scheme can be predicted in a manner resembling the Ewald construction. A
key factor is the transfer of photon momentum to the electron, which breaks the
symmetry and causes a rigid shift of the final-state energy isosphere. Working
rigorously in k-space, our model does not need to assume a localization in real
space, but works for itinerant band states without any assumptions or
restrictions. The role of momentum conservation in Fermi's Golden Rule at X-ray
energies is revealed in a graphical, intuitive way. The results are relevant
for the emerging field of time-resolved photoelectron diffraction and can be
combined with standing-wave excitation to gain element sensitivity.

the initial neutrino distribution is symmetrised in momentum space. We confirm
that this method reduce shot-noise significantly, but we also find that it

the pressure difference between magnetized and non-magnetized gas by Dicke to
include rotating turbulence. While the (vertical) background field provides a
positive-definite magnetic pressure difference between the magnetized and the
unmagnetized gas, Reynolds stress and Maxwell stress of turbulence strongly
modify this result. With the quasilinear approximation we demonstrate that the
influence of the turbulence differs between the high-conductivity and the
low-conductivity limits. Sufficiently small magnetic Reynolds numbers lead to
magnetic pressure suppression where indeed the pressure excess can even assume
negative values. Box simulations of magnetoconvection subject to a vertical
magnetic field carried out with the Nirvana code confirm this overall picture.
They also demonstrate how a global rotation {\em reduces} the negative magnetic
pressure effect. For rapid rotation the total magnetic pressure difference
caused by large-scale magnetic fields { and} turbulence even fully disappears
for small field strengths. Magnetic fields of moderate strength thus neither
reduce nor enhance the turbulence pressure of rapidly rotating convection.
Consequences of this phenomenon for the star formation efficiency are shortly
discussed.

ions and electrons, amplification via electron avalanches and finally signal
generation. For the ionizing interaction of particles with the gas, different
options and physics models exist. The present paper focuses on how to use
Geant4, Garfield++ (including its Heed and SRIM interfaces) and Degrad to
create the ionization electron-ion pairs in the gas. Software-wise, the
proposed idea is to use the Geant4 physics parameterization feature, and to
implement a Garfield++ or Degrad based detector simulation as an external
model. With a Degrad model, detailed simulations of the X-ray interaction in
gaseous detectors, including shell absorption by photoelectric effect,
subsequent Auger cascade, shake-off and fluorescence emission, become possible.
A simple Garfield++ model can be used for photons (Heed), heavy ions (SRIM) and
relativistic charged particles or MIPs (Heed). For non-relativistic charged
particles, more effort is required, and a combined Geant4/Garfield++ model must
be used. This model, the Geant4/Heed PAI model interface, uses the Geant4 PAI
model in conjunction with the Heed PAI model. Parameters, such as the lower
production cut of the Geant4 PAI model and the lowest electron energy limit
have to be set correctly. The paper demonstrates how to determine these
parameters for certain values of the W parameter and Fano factor of the gas

then verified against the results obtained with the stand-alone software

purely kinematic description. The solution has two asymptotic limits: if the
duration of the ram pressure pulse exceeds the period of vertical oscillations
perpendicular to the galactic plane, the commonly used quasi-static criterion
of Gunn & Gott is obtained which uses the maximum ram pressure that the galaxy
has experienced along its orbit. For shorter pulses the outcome depends on the
time-integrated ram pressure. This parameter pair fully describes the gas mass
fraction that is stripped from a given galaxy. This approach closely reproduces
results from SPH simulations. We show that typical galaxies follow a very tight
relation in this parameter space corresponding to a pressure pulse length of
about 300 Myr. Thus, the Gunn & Gott criterion provides a good description for
galaxies in larger clusters. Applying the analytic description to a sample of
232 Virgo galaxies from the GoldMine database, we show that the ICM provides
indeed the ram pressures needed to explain the deficiencies. We also can
distinguish current and past strippers, including objects whose stripping state
was unknown.

presentation of the main tools used in the study of symmetries of Lagrange
equations for holonomic systems and subsequently to show how these tools are
applied in the major models of modern cosmology in order to derive exact
solutions and deal with the problem of dark matter/energy. The key role in this
approach are the first integrals of the field equations. We start with the Lie
point symmetries and the first integrals defined by them, that is the Hojman
integrals. Subsequently we discuss the Noether point symmetries and the well
known method for deriving the Noether integrals. By means of the Inverse
Noether Theorem we show that to every Hojman quadratic first integral one is
possible to associate a Noether symmetry whose Noether integral is the original
Hojman integral. It is emphasized that the point transformation generating this
Noether symmetry need not coincide with the point transformation defining the
Lie symmetry which produces the Hojman integral. We discuss the close
connection between the Lie point and the Noether point symmetries with the
collineations of the metric defined by the kinetic energy of the Lagrangian. In
particular the generators of Noether point symmetries are elements of the
homothetic algebra of that metric. The key point in the current study of
cosmological models is the introduction of the mini superspace, that is the
space which is defined by the physical variables of the model, which is not the
spacetime where the model evolves. The metric in the mini superspace is found
from the kinematic part of the Lagrangian and we call it the kinetic metric.
The rest part of the Lagrangian is the effective potential.

double-beta decay from the ${}^{136}$Xe isotope using a high-purity xenon TPC.
Efficient discrimination of the events through pattern recognition of the
topology of primary ionisation tracks is a major requirement for the
experiment. However, it is limited by the diffusion of electrons. It is known
that the addition of a small fraction of a molecular gas to xenon reduces
electron diffusion. On the other hand, the electroluminescence (EL) yield drops
and the achievable energy resolution may be compromised. We have studied the
effect of adding several molecular gases to xenon (CO${}_{2}$, CH${}_{4}$ and
CF${}_{4}$) on the EL yield and energy resolution obtained in a small prototype
of driftless gas proportional scintillation counter. We have compared our
results on the scintillation characteristics (EL yield and energy resolution)
with a microscopic simulation, obtaining the diffusion coefficients in those
conditions as well. Accordingly, electron diffusion may be reduced from about
10 mm/$\sqrt{\mathrm{m}}$ for pure xenon down to 2.5 mm/$\sqrt{\mathrm{m}}$
using additive concentrations of about 0.05%, 0.2% and 0.02% for CO${}_{2}$,
CH${}_{4}$ and CF${}_{4}$, respectively. Our results show that CF${}_{4}$
admixtures present the highest EL yield in those conditions, but very poor
energy resolution as a result of huge fluctuations observed in the EL
formation. CH${}_{4}$ presents the best energy resolution despite the EL yield
being the lowest. The results obtained with xenon admixtures are extrapolated
to the operational conditions of the NEXT-100 TPC. CO${}_{2}$ and CH${}_{4}$
show potential as molecular additives in a large xenon TPC, CH${}_{4}$ showing
the best performance and stability to be used in the NEXT-100 TPC, with an
extrapolated energy resolution of 0.4% at 2.45 MeV for concentrations below
0.4%.

the following several decade in aerospace engineering. Although RANS models are
widely used, empiricism and large discrepancies between models reduce the
reliability of simulating complex flows. Therefore, in recent years,
data-driven turbulence model has aroused widespread concern in fluid mechanics.
Based on the experimental/numerical simulation results, this approach aims to
modify or construct the turbulence model for specific purposes by machine
learning technologies. In this paper, we take the results calculated by SA
model as training data. Different from low Reynolds number turbulent flows, the
data from high Reynolds number flows shows an apparent scaling effect, thus
leading to difficulties in the data-driven modeling. In order to improve the
fitting accuracy, we divided the flow field into near-wall region, wake region,
and far-field region, and built individual model for every region. In this
paper, we adopted the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and some
auxiliary optimization algorithms to reconstruct a mapping function between
mean variables and the eddy viscosity. Since this model reflects the
relationship between local flow characteristics and turbulent eddy viscosity,
it is independent on the airfoil shape and flow condition. The training data in
this paper is generated from only three subsonic flow calculations of NACA0012
airfoil. By coupling the proposed approach with N-S equations, we calculated
various flow cases as well as two different airfoils and showed the eddy
viscosity contours, velocity profiles along the normal direction of wall and

dedicated methods for variable clustering with the Gaussian graphical model
have been proposed. Even more severe, small insignificant partial correlations
due to noise can dramatically change the clustering result when evaluating for
example with the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC). In this work, we try to
address this issue by proposing a Bayesian model that accounts for negligible
small, but not necessarily zero, partial correlations. Based on our model, we
propose to evaluate a variable clustering result using the marginal likelihood.
To address the intractable calculation of the marginal likelihood, we propose
two solutions: one based on a variational approximation, and another based on
MCMC. Experiments on simulated data shows that the proposed method is similarly
accurate as BIC in the no noise setting, but considerably more accurate when
there are noisy partial correlations. Furthermore, on real data the proposed
method provides clustering results that are intuitively sensible, which is not
always the case when using BIC or its extensions.

single-photon sources is the interaction with phonons. We study the effect of
phonon decoherence on the indistinguishability of single photons emitted from a

the indistinguishability is limited by the coupling between the quantum dot and
the fundamental vibrational modes of the waveguide and is sensitive to the
quantum-dot position within the nanobeam cross-section. We show that this
decoherence channel can be efficiently suppressed by clamping the waveguide
with a low refractive index cladding material deposited on the waveguide. With
only a few microns of cladding material, the coherence of the emitted single

indistinguishability can reach near unity and become independent of the
quantum-dot position. We finally show that the cladding material may serve dual
purposes since it can also be applied as a means to efficiently outcouple
single photons from the nanophotonic waveguide into an optical fiber. Our

integrating systems arises when many of these protocols/frameworks come into

organisms, across all kingdoms of life. Coordinated flows are fundamental to
power deformations, required for migration or development, or to spread
resources and signals. A ubiquitous mechanism to generate flows, particularly
prominent in animals and amoeba, is acto-myosin cortex driven mechanical
deformations that pump the fluid enclosed by the cortex. Yet, it is unclear how
cortex dynamics can self-organize to give rise to coordinated flows across the
largely varying scales of biological systems. Here, we develop a
mechanochemical model of acto-myosin cortex mechanics coupled to a
contraction-triggering, soluble chemical. The chemical itself is advected with
the flows generated by the cortex driven deformations of the tubular-shaped
cell. The theoretical model predicts a dynamic instability giving rise to
stable patterns of cortex contraction waves and oscillatory flows.
Surprisingly, simulated patterns extend beyond the intrinsic length scale of
the dynamic instability - scaling with system size instead. Patterns appear
randomly but can be robustly generated in a growing system or by
flow-generating boundary conditions. We identify oscillatory flows as the key
for the scaling of contraction waves with system size. Our work shows the
importance of active flows in biophysical models of patterning, not only as a
regulating input or an emergent output, but rather as a full part of a
self-organized machinery. Contractions and fluid flows are observed in all
kinds of organisms, so this concept is likely to be relevant for a broad class

functions as explicit first-order objects and enable the specification of rich
properties of flow networks. The syntax of our logic BFL* (Branching Flow
Logic) is similar to the syntax of the temporal logic CTL*, except that atomic
assertions may be flow propositions, like $> \gamma$ or $\geq \gamma$, for
$\gamma \in \mathbb{N}$, which refer to the value of the flow in a vertex, and
that first-order quantification can be applied both to paths and to flow
functions. We present an exhaustive study of the theoretical and practical
aspects of BFL*, as well as extensions and fragments of it. Our extensions
include flow quantifications that range over non-integral flow functions or
over maximal flow functions, path quantification that ranges over paths along
which non-zero flow travels, past operators, and first-order quantification of
flow values. We focus on the model-checking problem and show that it is
PSPACE-complete, as it is for CTL*. Handling of flow quantifiers, however,
increases the complexity in terms of the network to ${\rm P}^{\rm NP}$, even
for the LFL and BFL fragments, which are the flow-counterparts of LTL and CTL.
We are still able to point to a useful fragment of BFL* for which the
model-checking problem can be solved in polynomial time. Finally, we introduce

reactions are commonly considered to occur in distributed zones broadened by
small-scale turbulent eddies. In the present communication, an alternative
regime of propagation of reaction waves in a highly turbulent medium is
introduced and studied theoretically and numerically. More specifically,
propagation of an infinitely thin reaction sheet in a turbulent medium is
analyzed, with molecular mixing of the reactant and product being allowed in
wide layers. In this limiting case, an increase in the consumption velocity by
turbulence is solely controlled by an increase in the reaction-sheet area.
Based on physical reasoning and estimates, the area is hypothesized to be close
to the mean area of an inert iso-scalar surface at the same turbulent Reynolds
number. This hypothesis leads to a relation for the turbulent consumption
velocity, which is similar to the well-known Damk\""ohler scaling associated
commonly with distributed reaction zones at a low Da. The obtained theoretical
results are validated by analyzing a big database (23 cases characterized by
0.01<Da<1) created recently in 3D direct numerical simulations of propagation
of a statistically planar, one-dimensional, dynamically passive reaction wave
in statistically stationary, homogeneous, isotropic turbulence. The DNS data
well support the aforementioned relation. They also show that the reaction is
localized to thin zones even at Da as low as 0.01, with a ratio of the
turbulent and laminar consumption velocities being mainly controlled by the
reaction-zone-surface area.

lane related research detection, estimation, and tracking in the past two
decades. The interest in this topic has increased even more with the demand for
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and self-driving cars. Although
extensively studied independently, there is still need for studies that propose
a combined solution for the multiple problems related to the ego-lane, such as
lane departure warning (LDW), lane change detection, lane marking type (LMT)
classification, road markings detection and classification, and detection of
adjacent lanes (i.e., immediate left and right lanes) presence. In this paper,
we propose a real-time Ego-Lane Analysis System (ELAS) capable of estimating
ego-lane position, classifying LMTs and road markings, performing LDW and
detecting lane change events. The proposed vision-based system works on a
temporal sequence of images. Lane marking features are extracted in perspective
and Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM) images that are combined to increase
robustness. The final estimated lane is modeled as a spline using a combination
of methods (Hough lines with Kalman filter and spline with particle filter).
Based on the estimated lane, all other events are detected. To validate ELAS
and cover the lack of lane datasets in the literature, a new dataset with more
than 20 different scenes (in more than 15,000 frames) and considering a variety
of scenarios (urban road, highways, traffic, shadows, etc.) was created. The
dataset was manually annotated and made publicly available to enable evaluation
of several events that are of interest for the research community (i.e., lane
estimation, change, and centering; road markings; intersections; LMTs;
crosswalks and adjacent lanes). ELAS achieved high detection rates in all
real-world events and proved to be ready for real-time applications.

many parameters pose serious theoretical and computational challenges.
Sophisticated numerical algorithms that automatically determine which
parameters need to be activated in the approximation space in order to estimate
a quantity of interest to a prescribed error tolerance are needed. For elliptic
PDEs with parameter-dependent coefficients, stochastic Galerkin finite element
methods (SGFEMs) have been well studied. Under certain assumptions, it can be
shown that there exists a sequence of SGFEM approximation spaces for which the
energy norm of the error decays to zero at a rate that is independent of the
number of input parameters. However, it is not clear how to adaptively
construct these spaces in a practical and computationally efficient way. We
present a new adaptive SGFEM algorithm that tackles elliptic PDEs with
parameter-dependent coefficients quickly and efficiently. We consider
approximation spaces with a multilevel structure---where each solution mode is
associated with a finite element space on a potentially different mesh---and
use an implicit a posteriori error estimation strategy to steer the adaptive
enrichment of the space. At each step, the components of the error estimator
are used to assess the potential benefits of a variety of enrichment
strategies, including whether or not to activate more parameters. No marking or
tuning parameters are required. Numerical experiments for a selection of test
problems demonstrate that the new method performs optimally in that it
generates a sequence of approximations for which the estimated energy error
decays to zero at the same rate as the error for the underlying finite element
method applied to the associated parameter-free problem.

spintronics-based nanometric single device whose resistance varies linearly as
a function of the incoming frequency. This analogue frequency sensor allows a
direct measurement of the incoming frequency and can work over many frequency
bands and could replace a significantly larger conventional electronics
circuit, thus reducing the footprint and potentially the energy cost. Three

the content of images in restricted domains. However, if these models are to
function in the wild - for example, as assistants for people with impaired

understood. To address this problem, we teach image captioning models new
visual concepts from labeled images and object detection datasets. Since image
labels and object classes can be interpreted as partial captions, we formulate
this problem as learning from partially-specified sequence data. We then
propose a novel algorithm for training sequence models, such as recurrent
neural networks, on partially-specified sequences which we represent using
finite state automata. In the context of image captioning, our method lifts the
restriction that previously required image captioning models to be trained on
paired image-sentence corpora only, or otherwise required specialized model
architectures to take advantage of alternative data modalities. Applying our
approach to an existing neural captioning model, we achieve state of the art
results on the novel object captioning task using the COCO dataset. We further
show that we can train a captioning model to describe new visual concepts from

energy from these small objects, making capture more likely. Also, we study the
relevance of the circumplanetary disk, a structure formed closely around the

as a linear least squares estimation problem, which resembles the classical
weighted least-squares (WLS) approach for scenarios where full network
observability is not available. We build on recently developed linear
approximations for unbalanced three-phase power flow to construct voltage
predictions as a linear mapping of load predictions constructed with Gaussian
processes. The estimation step to update the voltage forecasts in real-time is
a linear computation allowing fast high-resolution state estimate updates. The
uncertainty in forecasts can be determined a priori and smoothed a posteriori,
making the method useful for both planning, operation and post-hoc analysis.
The method outperforms conventional WLS and is applied to different test

determines the frame up to unitary equivalence). Given such a Gramian, it can
be determined whether or not the tight frame is projective group frame, i.e.,
is the projective orbit of some group $G$ (which may not be unique). On the
other hand, there is complete description of the projective group frames in
terms of the irreducible projective representations of $G$. Here we consider
the inverse problem of taking the Gramian of a projective group frame for a
group $G$, and identifying the cocycle and constructing the frame explicitly as
the projective group orbit of a vector $v$ (decomposed in terms of the
irreducibles). The key idea is to recognise that the Gramian is a group matrix
given by a vector $f\in\mathbb{C}^G$, and to take the Fourier transform of $f$
to obtain the components of $v$ as orthogonal projections. This requires the
development of a theory of group matrices and the Fourier transform for
projective representations. Of particular interest, we give a block
diagonalisation of (projective) group matrices. This leads to a unique Fourier

phenomenological theory of phase transitions and, furthermore, the foundation
for a large amount of the now-classical developments in nonlinear science.
However, the $\phi^4$ model, in its usual variant (symmetric double-well
potential), can only possess two equilibria. Many complex physical systems
possess more than two equilibria and, furthermore, the number of equilibria can
change as a system parameter (e.g., the temperature in condensed matter
physics) is varied. Thus, ""higher-order field theories"" come into play. This
chapter discusses recent developments of higher-order field theories,
specifically the $\phi^6$, $\phi^8$ models and beyond. We first establish their
context in the Ginzburg--Landau theory of successive phase transitions,
including a detailed discussion of the symmetric triple well $\phi^6$ potential
and its properties. We also note connections between field theories in
high-energy physics (e.g., ""bag models"" of quarks within hadrons) and
parametric (deformed) $\phi^6$ models. We briefly mention a few salient points
about even-higher-order field theories of the $\phi^8$, $\phi^{10}$, etc.\
varieties, including the existence of kinks with power-law tail asymptotics
that give rise to long-range interactions. Finally, we conclude with a set of
open problems in the context of higher-order scalar fields theories.

Composite Higgs set-up. The phenomenology entailed by such interactions is
thoroughly analysed by studying heavy vector resonances production and decay
modes in the viable resonance mass range. Additionally, the production of
double and single-composite fermion final states has been scanned along the
fermion mass scale. Such production is mediated by the SM gauge and Higgs
interactions, and also by charged and neutral vector resonances. The coupling
between the new fermions and vector resonances induces a sizeable effect in the
production rates. We use the recent 13 TeV LHC searches for vector-like quarks
to constrain our parameter space. Specifically, we explore the allowed regions
by analysing the decays of a heavy vector-like quark in the $Wb$-channel. We
conclude that generically the impact of the couplings between the spin-1 and
spin-1/2 resonances will substantially reduce the permitted regions, leading us
to test the sensitivity of the parametric dependence in the light of exotic
matter interactions.

field has been discussed frequently in recent years. The spin and orbital
angular momenta cannot be made simultaneously gauge invariant and Lorentz
covariant and are not conserved separately. After analyzing the source of the
problem, we find that the electromagnetic 4-potential depends on the local
reference frame instead of the global reference frame. The transformation of
the local reference frame is the intrinsic degree of freedom of the
electromagnetic field. Therefore, considering only the Lorentz transformation
of the global reference frame and neglecting the Lorentz transformation of the
local reference frame may lead to the noncovariance of the electromagnetic
4-potential. Accordingly, we redescribe these difficulties of the
electromagnetic field from the perspective of quantum field theory. By using
the behavior of the electromagnetic 4-potential that satisfies the Coulomb
gauge in Lorentz coordinate transformation, we can construct the
electromagnetic vector in the tetrad bundle. The various physical quantities
that are induced by this electromagnetic vector satisfy Lorentz covariance in
the tetrad bundle. This electromagnetic vector, which is projected onto
space-time, is an electromagnetic 4-potential that satisfies the Coulomb gauge;
thus, the electromagnetic vector is gauge invariant.

  Avalanche Diodes","17 pages, 11 figures",,,,"physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) based transient imaging suffers from an
aberration called pile-up. When multiple photons arrive within a single
repetition period of the illuminating laser, the SPAD records only the arrival
of the first photon; this leads to a bias in the recorded light transient
wherein the transient response at later time-instants are under-estimated. An
unfortunate consequence of this is the need to operate the illumination at
low-power levels to reduce the probability of multiple photons returning in a
single period. Operating the laser at low power results in either low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the measured transients or reduced frame rate
due to longer exposure durations to achieve a high SNR. In this paper, we
propose a signal processing-based approach to compensate pile-up in
post-processing, thereby enabling high power operation of the illuminating
laser. While increasing illumination does cause a fundamental information loss
in the data captured by SPAD, we quantify this information loss using
Cramer-Rao bound and show that the errors in our framework are only limited to
this information loss. We experimentally validate our hypotheses using real
data from a lab prototype.

useful - but also cannot be sure what the properties of the web of connections

generating a set of synthetic innovation web ""dictionaries"" that can be used to
host sampled innovation timelines, probe the overall statistics and behaviours
of these processes, and determine the degree of their reliance on the structure
or generating algorithm. Thus, inspired by the work of Fink, Reeves, Palma and
Farr (2017) on innovation in language, gastronomy, and technology, I study how
new symbol discovery manifests itself in terms of additional ""word"" vocabulary
being available from dictionaries generated from a finite number of symbols.
Several distinct dictionary generation models are investigated using numerical
simulation, with emphasis on the scaling of knowledge as dictionary generators
and parameters are varied, and the role of which order the symbols are
discovered in.

the era of Big Data, information is being generated at a fast pace, and
analyzing the same is a challenge. Various methods have been proposed to speed
up the analysis of the data and also mining it for information. All of this
often involves using a massive array of compute nodes, and transmitting the
data over the network. Of course, with the huge quantity of data, this poses a
major issue to the task of gathering intelligence from data. Therefore, in
order to address such issues with Big Data, using data compression techniques
is a viable option. Since graphs represent most real world data, methods to
compress graphs have been in the forefront of such endeavors. In this paper we
propose techniques to compress graphs by finding specific patterns and
replacing those with identifiers that are of variable length, an idea inspired
by Huffman Coding. Specifically, given a graph G = (V, E), where V is the set
of vertices and E is the set of edges, and |V| = n, we propose methods to
reduce the space requirements of the graph by compressing the adjacency
representation of the same. The proposed methods show up to 80% reduction is
the space required to store the graphs as compared to using the adjacency
matrix. The methods can also be applied to other representations as well. The
proposed techniques help solve the issues related to computing on the graphs on
resources limited compute nodes, as well as reduce the latency for transfer of
data over the network in case of distributed computing.
